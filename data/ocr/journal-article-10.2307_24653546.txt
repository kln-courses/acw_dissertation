<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LION-BOWL AND OTHER WORKED STONE OBJECTS FROM JEBEL KHALID Margaret O'Hea As elsewhere, the worked stone objects from the Hellenistic town of Jebel Khalid fall broadly into two functional groups: those for ritual use, and those for utilitarian, domestic use. The discussion of the various categories of stone objects presented here will precede their catalogue descriptions. Only the type example is fully described, and its provenance given in brackets. All measurements are in centimetres: ht indicates height (as extant for pieces whose original size remains unknown), d stands for depth, th for thickness, w for width, t-h for 'thread-hole'. A minimum number estimate (MNE) is based upon rejoinable fragments and rim or base fragments; only types with more than one MNE are so listed in the catalogue. RITUAL BOWLS To date, there are only two stone vessels that can be directly associated with ritual activity at Jebel Khalid. The first is a highly polished fragment of a small diorite ledge-rimmed bowl (WS 34) with distinctively-ridged external carination (fig. 1; pl. 11: 1). The rarity of such highly-finished stone bowls throughout the Persian or Hellenistic Levant when compared with chalk, limestone, or basalt bowls reinforces the supposition of a specialized use for them. Our example came from the general area of the Hellenistic-Roman temple, suggesting but not proving some ritual function. Broadly speaking, its form seems purely Levantine, in that ledge-rimmed stone bowls are part of an Achaemenid tradition that persisted throughout the Hellenistic period,1 whilst the stone itself can be sourced within the region.2 The external ridge is found on a similar but not identical diorite ledge-rimmed bowl of uncertain date from Samaria-Sebaste.-5 Ours could be as late as the first century ad, given the use of the temple into this period. The second ritual vessel was the unexpected discovery in 2006 of a fragmentary dark grey steatite or chlorite lion-bowl (WS 15) from Area S, downslope from the Hellenistic insula of the Domestic Quarter. Although it came from an upper, post-abandonment level, the survival of stone walls to surface levels upslope make it unlikely to have washed far downhill, and it is far removed from any identifiable public buildings. Despite its find spot in an abandoned Late Hellenistic house, this battered bowl fragment belongs to a series of specifically North Syrian cultic vessels broadly dating to the 9th-7th centuries bc.4 Whilst Iron Age settlements are well known in its vicinity,5 to date no stratified contexts preceding the Seleucid period have been identified at Jebel Khalid. But the site is large, and the possibility of Iron Age occupation in areas not yet excavated by the Australian project cannot be excluded [see on this very question the paper by M. Mottram in this volume; ed.]. It is necessary, therefore, to recap what is known about this group of vessels and what practices they manifest. Ο.

They were made in ivory, Egyptian blue, but most commonly in steatite/chlorite.6 A variety of carved decorative motifs on the base—frequently a hand, volute-pal mette or crossed bands—were combined with one or more lion's heads, sphinxes and/or Imdugud birds around the bowl's rim.7 One sub-group, however, has a lion protome over and around the projecting rear tube, usually in combination with other motifs. Attempts to connect datable, excavated examples of the entire series with more numerous purchased acquisitions have merged quite different motifs and stylistic traits into the one discussion, and resulted in varying estimates of the number of authentic lion-bowls.8 Including Jebel Khalid's example, excavated bowls with lion protomai at the rear in all media number only 31 at present, from 16 sites: 8 from Nimrud,9 5 from Hasanlu,10 3 from Nineveh," 2 each from Samos and Çatal Huyiik in the Konya Plain,12 one each from Zinçirli, Bogazkoy, Tell Tayinat and Çatal Hoyiik (Amuq Valley),13 Khorsabad,14 Assur,15 Carchemish,16 Tell Beit Mirsim,17 Kinneret,18 and Tel Zeror.19 Not all of these have sound contextual dating, and many are fragmentary. Only 16 excavated examples are steatite/chlorite, including the Jebel Khalid bowl (see Table 1), and all but the Carchemish lion-bowl are made of the Syrian dark grey-green variety—sometimes called serpentine because of its hue—rather than the reddish northern Mesopotamian steatite more commonly seen in purchased examples.20 The bigger sample of all kinds of decorated 'pipe-bowls' broadly reflects the distribution of the lion group: that is, an earlier concentration in northern, Aramaean Syria, transmission into Assyria by the end of the 8th century, and 7th-century dissemination via Assyrian domination of Israel/Judah and, to a lesser extent, Ammon. A much larger collection are of purchased stone lion-bowls—at least 35 with an even wider range of combined motifs and stylistic details, not including a group claimed to have been illegally dug up around Tanjara in Syria.21 At best, their authenticity—and thus their legitimacy to be included in 6 Muscarella art. cit. 25. 7 S.

A full exploration of all lion-bowls by Muscarella is warmly anticipated.22 In the interim, a few useful stylistic points can be noted. With the exception of the Carchemish bowl (a possible purchase during excavations),2j the lion's head is always open mouthed, but it sits at one of two positions: either straddling the tubular hole into the bowl, or sitting fully above the rim. Heads of the first type always have muzzles projecting well over the rim, but show lower canines and tongue in relief on the bowl's internal base. This holds true for bowls both with and without good provenances. On the rarer second type, the open mouth reveals both upper and lower canines, the latter projecting up from the top of the rim. Only the rear portion of the Jebel Khalid bowl survives (pi. 11: 2). On the outside of a wide, shallow bowl with rounded base and polished interior, two bent forelegs grip the rear of the bowl, their bent joints drilled free of the sides, and their linear-cut paws sit on the rim. A large lateral hole, drilled through the lower rear wall, opens into the bowl. Above this hole, the rim shows rough lateral gouges (pi. 11:3) which probably indicate the interior of the open jaw of a missing head; abraded bumps might once have been the lower canines. Enough survives to suggest that the inner bowl never had carved teeth or tongue. It seems, then, that the overall pose most closely resembles the lion-bowl from Assur. Although the Amuq valley lion's head also rests on the rim, its mouth is smaller and foreparts arranged differently. The two paws on the Jebel Khalid bowl are the best-preserved sections of the vessel, yet are indicated merely by basic, gouged lines (pi. 11: 4). Even allowing for poor condition, they are unlike the well articulated claws and paws on the Assur lion-bowl, which stylistically resembles all of those from Hasanlu and Nimrud. Even the simplified paws on the Amuq valley and Tell Beit Mirsim bowls are more modelled than ours. The most schematic, provenanced paws are from the diverse locations of Samos and Khorsabad, which does not help to indicate any regional pattern. That said, a bowl bought at Sandilieh—close to both Abu Qalqal and Jebel Khalid—also has schematic paws, although the lion's posture does not resemble that of our bowl.24 A tempting hypothesis would be not of differing regional styles but of 'major' and 'minor' workshops—larger, royal production centres with greater access to common artisanal traditions as opposed to centres more reliant on local styles, all dotted across the Levant. Of course, chronological differences could also partly explain the wide variation in glyptic styles on stone lion-bowls, but there are very few examples with sound stratigraphie dating to demonstrate this. Nimrud's bowls are all likely to go back to the 8th century at the latest; an extremely well preserved ivory bowl from well AJ at Nimrud is also stylistically connected to North Syrian ivories which are usually placed no later than the 8th century. The 13th-century bc dating for the Bogazkôy lion-bowl would make it the only Late Bronze Age example (although the hand-bowls began in this period); in any case, it is now clear that there was post-Hittite occupation within the city.25 Both the Assur and Khorsabad bowls came from 'late' contexts, as did both bits of a single steatite bowl from Hasanlu.26 The remainder have only broad Iron Age 11—III dates.

Much revolves on determining the reason for a rear tube of varying length. Many tubes display some kind of collar or offset, which is presumed by all modern scholars to be a practical way of allowing it to be either inserted into something, or have something inserted into it. However, several complete bowls have such short tubular projections that it is unlikely that they could have been effectively inserted into anything: these include a complete, double-tubed ivory bowl from Nimrud, the Khorsabad steatite bowl and the Egyptian blue Kinneret bowl. V. Fritz proposed that a leather or skin bag might have instead been attached to the 3 mm long tube of the Kinneret bowl - an equally unwieldy solution, considering that the bag would have been full of oil.27 Why pierce the bowl at all? Since the early 20th century, there have been two main hypotheses. One is that the bowls contained incense, to be held or waved before the face of the gods at the end of an attached tube, following a late New Kingdom practice of using long handles ending in a cupped hand to proffer an incense bowl.28 The other view is that they were for liquids to be poured onto a cultic object. The tube was itself inserted into the mouth of an oil flask which served as a de facto arm and supplier of liquid into the bowl. In either case, the idea was to lessen the risk of profaning a sacred object by human touch.29 Both hypotheses, therefore, require the bowl to be supported or held via an inserted object, but as has been seen, the second hypothesis would have been messy at best, impractical at worst. In addition, Amiran pointed out that such a bowl was suited not for pouring—it has no spout—but for dipping into or anointing with the fingers, or for the evaporation of a perfumed liquid.3 Nevertheless, the idea that liquids were involved seems to have indirect support by the existence of an Archaic Cretan ceramic combination of lion-bowl with perfumed oil vessel."'1 The argument in favour of incense rather than perfumed oil relied on 19th-Dynasty illustrations on the northern walls of the Hall of Soker at Abydos, showing the pharaoh wafting an incense bowl before the god.·12 This parallel has its value, although not as originally discussed. Both S. Przeworski and W. F. Albright assumed that the attachment for the bowl was hollow, Przeworski thinking this was for fanning the burning incense with human breath, Albright, by contrast, that they might allow the holder to 'smoke' the incense.Given that incense can be small, light, and loose, the former would have been ineffective and unnecessary, and the latter possibly injurious to the inhaler. But the Abydos reliefs clearly show in both cases a hand-shaped handle with curled-up solid end, not a hollow rod, with a separate bowl sitting on the hand—so no inhalation or exhalation could have taken place. The strongest argument against the Syrian bowls as incense-holders should simply rest on the lack of any scorch-marks on any lion-bowls, including faience and ivory examples from Hasanlu, Kinneret, Nimrud, and Samos. Ivory is, in addition, a medium that does not respond well to applied heat.34 At the same time there are no visible oil-stains from liquid contents either. The Jebel Khalid bowl has no tube at all. It could, of course, simply have broken away, as with the head and lower teeth on the rim. A small vertical drill-mark is visible at an angle on the lower edge of the tubular hole (pi. 11: 2 top). This could be interpreted as an accidental 27 Fritz art. cit. (η. 8) 233,238. 28 van Loon art. cit. (η. 4) 18. 29 Ibid. 19; Albright op. cit. 72. j0 Amiran art. cit. 172. 31 Fritz art. cit. 238.

If there had been a projecting tube, this hole must have been drilled into it from below. This, too, is possible. An irregular hole also appears in the base of an unprovenanced lion-bowl now in Hamburg, which Fritz suggested was for the insertion of a subsidiary handle.35 Yet problems exist with this hypothesis: why would a second handle be needed, and how would it avoid decreasing the flow through the tube? If intended as a plug for the tube, it is both awkwardly placed and ineffective. An incomplete ivory bowl (S81) from Nimrud which still preserves its tube also has a clear but very small hole vertically drilled right through, whilst the ivory bowl from Samos has a drill hole into the tube, but only from above and not all the way through.36 Given the small size and locations of all these holes, the only alternative explanation for them is for threading a suspension-thong when not in use. Perhaps we are simply looking for efficiencies of form and function where none was originally required. However these bowls were used, they clearly had a specific and limited function not covered by other bowls or pourers. As with the other motifs present on this type of bowl, the apotropaic imagery of lions (sacred to Astarte) suggests but does not prove a ritualistic function. If religious, they are certainly not associated with temples. At Hasanlu, the ivory and faience bowls came from Burnt Buildings II and V, one of which has a debated religious function, the other certainly a more artisanal one.37 The Tel Zeror and Tell Beit Mirsim bowls were not found in any clearly religious building, whilst the Kinneret bowl came from a defensive tower and the Nimrud bowls from the SE and NW palaces.38 Nor was incense solely a formal religious activity. As M. D. Fowler pointed out, medicinal and secular fumigations took place in ancient societies.39 If not items for public rituals, steatite pierced bowls could have been used in some unknown private cultic activity—perhaps even some healing ritual use for invalids. We can never know precisely how our lion-bowl fragment reached a private house in the Late Hellenistic town. The simplest explanation is that an Iron Age settlement lies somewhere on the unexcavated upper slopes of the jebel If this is not the case, the deliberate possession of earlier ritual material has at least three hypothetical explanations: a culturally neutral form of antiquarianism (including chance finds by local inhabitants), familial inheritance, or cultic inheritance by a community with shared religious practices. In the case of a pair of Urartian/ North Syrian cauldron's bull-handles which was found in the Hellenistic phase at Tell Rifa'at, for example, any of these hypotheses is equally valid, simply because of the large-scale Iron Age settlement directly under that town.40 Jebel Khalid does have some evidence of strong indigenous and traditional beliefs even within the Hellenized settlement: for example, the heavy emphasis upon incense sacrifice in the final, Roman phase of the temple, and the presence of purely Syrian imagery on some seal stones from private houses.41 However, the ancient and heavy erosion on the steatite bowl strongly mitigates against its cultic use within the Hellenistic period.

At what point in time this might have occurred is, of course, a moot point. Three, more shattered, fragments of either torso or limbs were also identified in a visibly similar marble, and may belong to a second, smaller statue (pi. 12: 2). Since nothing of either torso is identifiable with certainty, we cannot yet know if these two statues were fully naked or semi-naked, but two more fragments probably belong to identifying accoutrements (WS 66) (pi. 12: 3-4). Their creased, soft yet bulky modelling indicates fabric or leather, whilst the swelling dimensions of the missing portion suggests they could be the tips of two Phrygian caps rather than, say, the bases of quivers or tips of bows. However, examples of three-dimensional Phrygian caps tend to date from the Roman period and to have more floppy tips to them, although two-dimensional representations can be stiffer 4j From the temple precinct come two abstracted anthropomorphic figurines carved in a soft, chalky limestone, which closely derive from the Iron Age II tradition as known from Megiddo and Beth Shean.44 The fragmentary WS 7 (pi. 12: 5) is more aniconic than WS 62 (pi. 12: 6), which was previously published along with a small incense altar in fossiliferous limestone.45 It shows clear signs of use.

Here, 'gypsum' has been used to denote the most easily abraded white calcium which was mined south of Jebel Khalid in the Tigris and Euphrates region, and 'calcite' for the harder, and often yellower calcium carbonate which is also called 'eastern alabaster'.46 Only WS1, from the Acropolis, could be 'Egyptian alabaster'—in reality, a form of marble. This is the largest vessel represented. WS 6 and WS 22 are standard narrow alabastra with rounded bases.47 WS 3 could belong to either an alabastron or jar. The lid or stopper WS 60 has lateral holes for a missing basket handle, but the function of the recessed hole on its lower face is uncertain; a similar lid was retrieved from Nessana, where the earliest occupation goes back to the 2nd century bc.48 WS 61 was clearly meant to be inserted onto a rod of some kind.

None has been associated with any specialized industrial zone (a commercial bakery, oil-production area) nor has any evidence yet emerged for any area of specialized stone-working at Jebel Khalid. Most of the stone vessels here are made of what is normally simply called basalt by Levantine archaeologists. This lava stone is visually identical to andesite; both can be compact or vesicular.49 North Syrian sources are olivine basalt, some with iron oxides, whereas Anatolian sources are basalt/andesite.50 Preliminary visual examination shows that 46 Moorey op. cit. (η. 2) 37. 47 Ph. Zaphiropolou, 'Vases et autres objets de marbre de Rhénée', Études déliennes. BCH Suppl. 1 (1973) 614-5 fig. 18. 48 H.

Even larger crystalline versions are called gabbro/diorite, the Syrian and/or Gulf sources for which are usually black or dark green with easily visible white crystals.52 Most utilitarian stone vessels show little typological development over long periods of time. The temenos area west of the temple yielded a rim from a large, cylindrical limestone bin (WS 55), carved from local stone. These have usually been interpreted as storage bins— unpublished examples from unexcavated Byzantine-Umayyad areas of Pella and Early Islamic contexts at Khirbet es-Sheikh Isa, southern Jordan).5j The reworked rim, however, suggests a secondary and different use. Unlike the sculpted fragments and altars, a harder, marl limestone was chosen for both this and two limestone convex bowls from the palatial complex on the Acropolis (WS 51 ) which must have had a domestic function (pi. 14: 1). They lack a surviving spout or visible internal wear which could indicate use as mortaria, but it is difficult to postulate a different function, since they are too shallow to be storage bins.54 The same form in basalt/andesite (WS 70) shows clear internal use-wear as mortaria; the type example even has a worn-away section of the rim (pi. 14: 3). Related are shallow cylindrical bowls (WS 24) in both vesicular and fine-grained basalt/andesite, all with internal use-wear (pi. 14: 4). Since none survives across the full diameter, it is possible but unlikely that some are the metae of a rotary quern—identifiable by a central handle-hole—since these were relatively uncommon in the Hellenistic period.55 Ours are, in any case, widely varying in diameters, from c. 15 to 31 cm. More likely to come from a spouted mortarium is a large ledge-handled bowl rim (WS 42), in granite/diorite (pi. 14: 2). Although this is twice the diameter of similar mortaria in other stones, the handle and profile do resemble Greek mortaria on Delos and early Roman Corinth.56 But it was a long-lived form, known much earlier in Late Period Egypt.57 Commonplace at Jebel Khalid are tripod- (WS 32, 44, 65) and ring-based mortaria (WS 49) in both fine-grained and vesicular basalt/andesite (pis. 14: 5; 15: 1) as well as a single example in marl limestone (pi. 14: 6). At least 14 examples are widely distributed across all types of occupation. Minor typological variants exist, but with no obvious spatial or chronological patterning: these range from a traditionally mortarium-like bowl with ring-base to a small number of rectangular footed basins (WS 31, 35). Tripod-based mortarium WS 59 has a distinctive ridge connecting each rectangular foot (pi. 15: 3). Unlike any other basalt vessel here, there are clear traces of calcinification on the interior of the bowl, which suggests special and constant use of water for the material ground in it. If excavations have so far identified 25 vessels that were for grinding or mixing, it is not surprising that at least 14 pounders have been retrieved (WS 10). These are simply defined as anything used in grinding or polishing whose use-worn surface is equal to or less than its height, and so vary from almost circular to naturally elongated pebbles chosen for their 51 Ibid. 296-7. 52 Moorey loc. cit.. 53 Basalt versions of similar size have in the past been called mortaria, D.

They are fairly evenly divided between fine-grained basalt/andesite, and chert river pebbles, with one in fossiliferous limestone.

All show extensive use-wear on both ends, but no signs of wear around their centres, as could be expected if they had functioned as hanging loomweights, for example. They must be pestles, as must the single example of a conical basalt pounder, WS 27—again, with use-wear on the largest face.58 The tiny agate polisher or pestle from the Acropolis (WS 37) could have been used for grinding medicines, toiletries, or for burnishing (pi. 16: 2).

The dominant domestic grindstone was, of course, the saddle quern (WS 29) in vesicular basalt/andesite (pi. 17: 1). The catalogued MNE of 18 excludes many, many more still on site, visible as surface finds and reused in domestic house rubble-walls. These elongated slabs are ubiquitous in most periods since the development of agriculture in the Levant, and were used in conjunction with lozenge-shaped, humped back 'rubbers' in non-vesicular basalt/andesite and the occasional alluvial pebble from the adjacent Euphrates. All show use-wear. Rubbers are defined here as anything that lias a wider use-surface than its height, as distinguished from pounders or pestles.59 Alongside the saddle querns, which could only grind relatively small quantities of grains at a time for domestic use, a small number of hopper-rubber mills were retrieved (WS 9). This type originated somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean in the early Iron Age, but by the time Jebel Khalid was settled, it had become the normal Greek grain-mill in domestic contexts, developing into variant, perhaps regional, forms by the Hellenistic period.60 Most are from the Domestic Quarter and 2 from housing around Area B, but none so far from the Acropolis. All are rectangular levered types, known throughout the Levant and common on Delos.61 As yet, no rotary quern fragment has been identified at Jebel Khalid, and hour-glass rotary querns are also absent—as may be expected for a Romano-Byzantine type developed in the Western Mediterranean—although one was collected in the vicinity of Tell Abu Qalqal.

Crewe observed, the trapezoidal loomweights common to the Hellenized world are rare but not unknown at Jebel Khalid.62 Instead, the older Iron Age Levantine type of unfired clay balls were abundant on the site. However, a single conical weight was found together with 7 doughnut-shaped vesicular basalt weights in the south-east corner of trench AK 200 (WS 16-17). They could be olive press weights, again, following Iron Age Levantine traditions,63 but are much smaller than those used in a 2nd-century bc press at Tirat-Yehuda,64 and even one from a Late Hellenistic or early Roman context at Knossos was twice the size of ours.6:1 59 Κ.

They are ubiquitous on Levantine sites, especially in Bronze and Iron Age levels and have been described variously as buttons, spindle-whorls, loomweights, possible lids or - most attractively—'buzz toys'.67 By themselves, typological comparisons can, of course, lead to what D. B. Harden once aptly termed the archaeologist's 'last despairing attempt at the concealment of ignorance'.68 There is certainly no need to classify them all as items solely used in spinning or weaving. Hellenistic and Roman spindle-whorls and loomweights in the Levant had a clearly-defined set of typological variants, of which Jebel Khalid has produced typical examples. Here, the pierced disks do not occur in clusters in domestic contexts—as might be expected for weaving—nor are they anything like the weight to be expected for vertical loom-weaving.69 That the double-drilled examples were ever 'buttons' is as unlikely as the attribution of spindle-whorls to the same function (see below). G. van Beek has shown that double-drilled disks are much more regularly-sized than single-drilled examples (2.7-3.8 cm, as opposed to 1.7-6 cm diameter),70 and this is repeated with the Jebel Khalid sample. Unfortunately, that really does no more than suggest that single pierced disks may have been put to many more uses than the other type—including the likely use as ajar-stopper. At Jebel Khalid, they are also found in every area of the site: Acropolis, temple, and houses. By contrast, all but one of the MNE 8 double-drilled stone examples come from domestic housing. Regardless of the number of holes, most perforated stone disks were made from the local chalk limestone; two were alluvial pebbles from the adjacent Euphrates, and there was one each from local mudstone and a specially-serrated white chalcedony disk (WS 21), previously published as a marble spindle-whorl.71 The solitary three-holed disk is of fine-grained limestone. Eleven of the MNE 15 stone 'counters' are unworked pebbles from the nearby river, used for small weights or game counters. Three others are mudstones, probably also from the river, and one of the 3 large counters is ceramic. All are widely dispersed across the site. There were probably many more than those so far catalogued, to which an MNE of 41 glass counters must be added. 66 Albright op. cit. 84 pl. 62 nos. 12-13. 67 G. van Beek, "The Buzz: Λ Simple Toy from Antiquity", BASOR 275, 1989.53-8. 68 D.

SPINDLE-WHORLS Up to 1998, an MNE of 71 spindle-whorls had been identified, 61 of which fell within the 'normal' hemispherical to conical form used by Eastern Mediterranean cultures.72 This section provides a brief update on the stone, bone, and vitreous spindle-whorls of this hemispherical-conical shape, which now total 106 stone, one bone, and 5 vitreous examples. No new forms have been identified. However, a re-examination of this sample has led to a revision of the identification of their stones. More than half had been labelled as diabase, a term often used interchangeably with dolerite, which is a coarser-grained form of basalt. Most of the remaining spindle-whorls were identified as a grey-green chalcedony, although none shows the characteristic milky translucency of the chalcedony group (which includes agates and carnelian). A re-examination found little differences in hardness, weight for size, visible crystalline appearance, or range of colours for both groups. Moreover, diorite objects should have a hardness of around Mohs 6, as opposed to the much softer chlorite from Iran or the Western Gulf which Moorey points out can vary from a 'soft green to black with a vitreous lustre to speckled grey'.7j Since the Jebel Khalid stone spindle-whorls exactly fall within this description, and were able to be easily carved, incised, and polished, they have all now been reclassified as steatite/chlorite. No attempt has, however, yet been made to source them through chemical finger-printing, which has its own limitations.74 Four plain spindle-whorls appear to be very fine-grained black stone with a matt surface which could be andesite or fine basalt, but have yet to be identified. A very small number are limestone. At least three steatite/ chlorite examples have been recovered with their iron spindles (pi. 19: 1). Only 25% of these have incised or (in the case of the 2 faience spindle-whorls, polychrome) decoration. Incised decoration appears on all kinds of stones as well as on bone.7i The abraded surfaces of all 3 glass whorls makes it difficult to tell if they were once decorated in any way.76 72 Ibid. 217. 7j Moorey op. cit.

They are found across the excavated areas of domestic housing in the lower city—47 from DQ, Sondage Beta and Area S - but nearly as many were retrieved from the Acropolis (MNE 40). By contrast, only 2 have been retrieved from the area of the temple, both of which may have washed down slope from the west, whilst another 6 come from the 'Stoa' Area. Striking is the high proportion of finds of pairs or their multiples on both the Acropolis and in the domestic housing—nearly 27%, which is more than random variation for such a sample (Table 2).

That this was not a cut-down colonette for re-use as a domestic incense stand seems likely by the complete absence of any signs of burning, and by the nearly-conical rather than hemispherical recess in the centre.
