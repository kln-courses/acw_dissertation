<plain_text><page sequence="1">HITTITE OBJECTS IN THE BRONZE AGE AEGEAN* By ERIC H. CLINE University of Pennyslvania Some twenty-three objects in the Bronze Age Aegean have been identified as "Hittite" in previous literature. Scholars investigating the nature of the relations between Hittites and Mycenaeans continue to cite one or more of these objects, although many have since been shown to be of non-Hittite origins. In this paper I propose to reexamine the "authenticity" of the Hittite objects reported within the Bronze Age Aegean. The twenty-three objects in question can readily be grouped as to (A) those which might be and (B) those which are not Central Anatolian Hittite in origin. A. Possible Central Anatolian Hittite 1) A seal impression (Heraklion Museum no. 688B'; P1. XXI a-b) from a stamp seal, found in an MM I or II deposit at Phaistos, Crete.' Stamped into the clay, the impression is oval and portrays two antithetical lions posed with a leaf motif between their heads. Good parallels for this scene and type of seal impression come from Karah6yiik in Central Anatolia.2 A Central Anatolian origin for the seal used is thus very possible, but it may be of pre-Hittite manufacture. 2) A serpentine or steatite sphinx statuette (Heraklion Museum no. 384; P1. XXI c) was found in a late MM III or early LM I tomb context at Ayia Triadha, Crete.3 Small, couchant and wingless, with a large circular depression in the centre of its back, this statuette has been the subject of much debate, both in terms of its use and its origins. Parallels can be drawn with Mesopotamian statuettes of similar size, material and style, which appear to have been used as lamps or, less likely, as inkwells.4 Additional parallels, primarily the "Hathor curls" framing the face, can also be drawn with the monumental Hittite sphinxes found, for example, at Alaca *The following study represents one aspect of an ongoing investigation of Orientalia in the Late Bronze Age Aegean.

A small (2-5 cm.) couchant sphinx in blue frit, pierced lengthwise through the body, was found at Bogazk6y in a Late Bronze Age level, but it is thought to be an Egyptian, or possibly a Syro-Palestinian, import.6 Small sphinx figurines are known from LBA contexts elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, e.g. Syro-Palestine, Egypt and Cyprus, used there as weights, pendants, seals, and occasionally as votive figurines. One should note especially the bronze weight in the shape of a small, couchant and wingless sphinx recently found on the Ka? shipwreck (KW no. 468; P1. XXI d).7 Rather than being an inkwell or a lamp, as previous scholars have suggested, the Ayia Triadha sphinx should perhaps be seen as a weight, with the depression in the centre of its back originally filled with lead to bring the object to a precise mass. Similar lead-filled haematite and bronze weights have been found on the Ka~ shipwreck and at Kalavassos-Ayios Dhimitrios, Cyprus.8 It seems most likely that the sphinx statuette at Ayia Triadha is an import from the Eastern Mediterranean or is a Minoan piece based upon Mesopotamian or Egyptian prototypes. A Central Anatolian Hittite or even a Mesopotamian origin cannot, however, be ruled out. 3) A metal stag rhyton (NMA no. 388; P1. XXII a) was found in Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae, an LH I context.9 Rhyta in the shape of four-legged animals with a spout centred on their back have a long history in Anatolia, and stags in particular were considered sacred. While an exact parallel for this rhyton at Mycenae is not readily found, stag statuettes in metal are known from third millennium B.C. contexts at Alaca H6yiik, and ceramic rhyta in the shape of stags, lions and bulls appear from the 16th century B.C. onwards at various Hittite sites.10 It is difficult to pinpoint the exact origins of the rhyton at Mycenae, for the stag was also favoured in northern nomadic art, i.e. in the Caucausus region. Moreover, ceramic four-legged animal rhyta were also made in Late Bronze Age Cyprus, some of which were exported to the Aegean, and others were made locally in the Aegean itself.' The composition of the stag at Mycenae, published by Schliemann as 2/3 silver, 1/3 lead, has been a major factor in the assignation of this piece to Anatolia. However, Dr. Z. A. Stos-Gale has recently conducted new analyses of this artifact and reports that the original analysis apparently was incorrect. The rhyton is not made from a silver-lead alloy, but is "99% silver with about 0-5% of gold and no more than 0-2% of lead."'2 Furthermore, the results of a lead isotope analysis conducted by Dr. Stos-Gale were as follows: 208Ph/206Ph 207Ph/206Ph 206Ph/204Ph 2-08029 0-84194 18-650 5Evans (1930) 420-5, 427, figs. 286-7; Dessenne (1957) 134-5, pi.

The closest match is with the lead deposits at Kallianou in Euboea, but, according to Dr. N. H. Gale, present analyses of the silver content in these deposits indicates that they are a bit low to have been a credible source of silver for the Mycenaeans.'3 In short, although the best artistic parallels for this stag rhyton at Mycenae are found in Anatolia, a Hittite origin must be seen as only one possibility among many. One cannot rule out European, Caucausian, Cypriot, other Anatolian or even local Aegean manufacture. 4) A silver "Smiting God" statuette (Ashmolean Mus. no. AE 410; P1. XXII b) was ostensibly found at Nezero, Thessaly. Purchased by Sir Arthur Evans, it comes from a context of unknown date and uncertain provenance. It is, in fact, impossible to determine the validity of its antiquity.14 Parallels, such as the squarish face and stocky build, have been drawn with a figurine from D6vlek, near Sivas in Anatolia. However, many additional features of the Nezero statuette, such as the hat and the skirt, more closely resemble the "Smiting God" statuettes from the Levant than those from Anatolia. The attribution of this statuette to Hittite Anatolia rather than to Syro-Palestine rests primarily upon its unique solid silver composition, usually explained in terms of the ready availability of silver in Anatolia. However, a lead isotope analysis was recently conducted by Dr. N. H. Gale, with the following results: 208Pb/206Pb 207Pb/206Pb 206Pb/204Pb 2-07408 0-83791 18-701 According to these figures, the silver in the statuette does not match the lead isotope composition of the few Anatolian ore sources yet published. A Laurion (Attica) source for the silver is also excluded as a result of this analysis.15 Many Anatolian ore sources are not yet analyzed, but given the existence of other Bronze Age silver sources, a Hittite origin for the Nezero statuette must be seen as only a possibility rather than a certainty. A Syro-Palestinian origin seems almost as likely, if the piece is truly an LBA creation rather than a modern forgery.'6 5) A lentoid pilgrim flask (P1. XXII c) was found in a well at Miletus on the western coast of Anatolia. Parallels from Troy and elsewhere indicate that the vessel might be of West Anatolian, rather than the previously-suggested Central Anatolian, manufacture.17 3N. H.

XXIII a) of red serpentine was found in a probable LH III context in Tomb 33 at lalysos, Rhodes.18 It is inscribed on both sides with a few Hittite signs in much simplified form and a number of other signs which do not appear to be Hittite. The origins of the semi-bulla are not clear. Similar semi-bullae have been found in second millennium contexts at a number of sites throughout Anatolia, including Bogazk6y, Alaca Hiiyiik, Beycesultan and Tarsus. However, a number of sites in North Syria, including Alalakh, Carch- emish, and Ras Shamra/Ugarit have also produced such semi-bullae.'9 Although clearly of either Anatolian or North Syrian origin, this lalysos semi-bulla must be seen as only possibly a product of Hittite Central Anatolia. 7) A steatite semi-bulla (NMA no. 6511; P1. XXIII b) found at Mycenae in LH IIIA2 Chamber Tomb 523 has long been referred to as "Hittite".20 This was only a literary designation, as originally defined by Hogarth, and was not meant to limit strictly its origins within Anatolia.21 The term "Hittite" referred rather to the class of objects in which the semi-bulla should be placed. The inscribed signs appear to be Hieroglyphic Luwian, a language and script used not only in Western Anatolia but also in Central Anatolia. However, since parallels for such semi- bullae may be found in both Anatolia and North Syria (supra), this semi-bulla at Mycenae also must be seen as only possibly a product of Hittite Central Anatolia.22 8) A cylinder seal (Inv. no. 3538; P1. XXIII c) of hard stone with a gold cap on each end was found in LH IIIC New Tomb 17 at lalysos, Rhodes.23 A recently published steatite cylinder seal in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum (Inv. no. 1995; P1. XXIV a-c) presents the best parallel yet found for this lalysos seal.24 A variety of comparisons may be made between the two seals, most strikingly the manner of representing the figures in outline form only. Both the stag-headed figure and the figure on the far right of the Ialysos seal may be tentatively compared to the "deity" wearing a headdress with two rows of horns on the Istanbul seal. Specifically, the horns and the gesture towards a symbol or standard of the stag- headed figure, the position of the arms and the large nose of the right-hand figure, and the depiction of legs and face in profile with the body shown frontally for both lalysos figures may be compared with those of the "deity" on the Istanbul seal. Close resemblances may also be seen between the right-hand figure of the lalysos seal and the figure on the far left of the Istanbul seal, in particular the large nose, the depiction of legs, face and body, and the symbol positioned over the extended hand. The head of the left-hand figure on the Istanbul seal has been obliterated by damage, but it is clear that it would have resembled either the elongated forehead of the right-hand lalysos figure or the two-pronged horn headress of the centre- right lalysos figure. Unfortunately, the Istanbul seal has no recorded provenance. While the '8Furtwangler and Loeschcke (1886) 15, 75, pl.

Furthermore, other small details on both seals, including the use of outline or linear technique for the depiction of the figures, are better paralleled by seals from Alalakh and Ras Shamra/Ugarit in North Syria than by seals from Central Anatolia.25 Hence, although the lalysos seal is apparently of Hittite manufacture, it is unclear whether it is of Central Anatolian or North Syrian origin. B. Not Central Anatolian Hittite 1) A cylinder seal ostensibly found in East Crete (Heraklion Museum no. 1278; P1. XXV a) comes from an unknown context and date. Rather than being "Hittite", as early publications stated, the flat caps on the figures and the flat and linear engraving used in the carving of the scene indicate a Mesopotamian origin and an Old Babylonian date for the seal.26 2) A cylinder seal (NMA no. 6214; P1. XXV b) of haematite was found in the "Tiryns Treasure".27 The hard material of the seal combined with the scene inscribed upon it, in particular the winged sundisc with small drillings bordering on the wings, indicate that the seal is of Mitannian manufacture. It is carved in the so- called Mitannian "Elaborate Style" and was most likely manufactured in North Syria.28 3) A cylinder seal (Inv. no. B7202; P1. XXV c) of dark grey stone was found in the Artemision cache on Delos. While the dating of the cache is still uncertain, the seal is most likely of Late Bronze (or possibly early Iron Age) date.29 The seal appears to be inscribed with a number of signs, a few of which resemble Linear A or B, Cypro-Minoan, and possible Hittite signs. It is not clear what is being represented, nor can any parallels from Central Anatolia be found. The origins of this seal should probably be sought outside of the Hittite homelands, but precisely where is not entirely clear.30 4) A serpentine or steatite sphinx statuette (Collection Dr. G. F. Reber; P1. XXVI a) was ostensibly found in a late MM III or early LM I context at Tylissos, Crete.31 It is virtually identical to the sphinx found at Ayia Triadha (supra, p. 133), although with two circular depressions in the centre of its back, and is almost always mentioned in connection with the latter. If genuine, the same arguments as given above for the Ayia Triadha sphinx should be applied to this sphinx at Tylissos. However, the authenticity of this object has recently been called into question and it appears likely that the Tylissos sphinx is merely a modern copy of that at Ayia Triadha.32 25Bittel (1976) Taf. 181-3, 186; Collon (1987) 70-1 (nos. 305-6, 308). 26Xanthoudides (1924) 117; Buchholz (1967) 154 (no. 18) with references; Platon, Pini &amp; Salies (1977) 425 (no. 287); Moller (1980) 91-4. 27Buchholz (1967) 158 (no. 100) with references; Sakellarakis (1982) 46 (no. 19), with photographs; Pini (1983) 119 (no. 17), 120-1. 28Porada (1980) 11-12; idem (1981) 36-46 (esp. seals nos. 19-20); Collon (1987) 65.

XXVI b) were found in a late MM III or early LM I context at Knossos.33 The reconstruction of this large sphinx is based on the smaller statuettes found at Ayia Triadha and Tylissos, and remains largely hypothetical and unproved. While possibly the remnants of a very large statue imported from Central Anatolia or Mesopotamia, it seems far more reasonable to assign these fragments to local Minoan work. 6) A cylinder seal (Heraklion Museum no. 1334; P1. XXVI c-d) of limestone was found in an MM III-LM III context in Tomb VIIA at Mavrospeleio, Crete.34 The form and movements of the man and animals pictured in the badly worn scene are similar to motifs found on both Crete and Cyprus. Rather than being a product of Central Anatolia, the seal is probably either Cypriot or Cretan in origin, carved in what is now referred to as the "Cypro-Aegean" style.35 7) A cylinder seal (Heraklion Museum no. 1189; P1. XXVII a) of black haematite was found at Tylissos, Crete in a probable LM I context.36 The iconographic and stylistic characterstics of the seal indicate a Syrian origin for this object, in particular the use of two scenes on the seal: a main scene of three figures in higher relief than the secondary scene which itself is divided by a guilloche into two registers. A parallel for this seal comes from Alalakh (AT/48/76), unfortunately in an undated context, but of such close similarity that it is suggested they both come from the same Old Syrian workshop, perhaps to be located in Alalakh itself.37 8) A cylinder seal (NMA no. 2447; P1. XXVII b) of haematite was found at Mycenae in LH IIB-IIIAI Chamber Tomb 47.38 The subject of intense discussion since its discovery, argument today centres around the animal-headed demons depicted on the seal. They are reminiscent of the Cypriot "Elaborate Style", but their short flaring kilts, stick-like legs, and the stylization of both feet and heads differ sufficiently from the Cypriot repertoire as to allow a persuasive argument for the manufacture of the seal in a Cretan workshop.39 9) A bronze "Smiting God" statuette (NMA no. 1582; P1. XXVII c) was found in an LH III context at Tiryns.40 The statuette has a number of features in common with the "Smiting God" statuettes of Syro-Palestinian manufacture, in particular the headgear which is more likely modelled upon the crown of Upper Egypt than upon the pointed hats of the Hittites.

No. 200; PI. XXVIII a) was found in an LH IIIB context in the New Kadmeion at Thebes, Boeotia.41 As Porada has noted, the seal contains several features divergent from the known Hittite style of Central Anatolia, in particular the slender proportions of the bodies of the figures and the lack of shoes with upturned toes. The closest parallel is with a sealing of Piha-ziti, possibly a king of Carchemish, on a tablet (RS 17.248) from Ras Shamra/Ugarit.42 It appears that the origins of the seal at Thebes should be sought in the Ugarit-Carchemish area of North Syria, rather than in Central Anatolia. Moreover, an attribution to North Syria agrees with the apparent distribution of cylinder seals in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.C. While the stamp seal had almost completely replaced the cylinder seal in Anatolia by this time, the rulers of North Syrian cities continued to use cylinder seals alongside stamp seals, and utilized both Hittite scenes and Hittite hieroglyphs.43 11) A semi-bulla (NMA no. 8184; P1. XXVIII b) of haematite was found at Perati in LH IIIB/C (transition) Tomb 24.44 It is inscribed with a variety of signs, in Hieroglyphic Luwian, Linear A or Linear B, and Cypro-Minoan. It is unlikely to be a Central Anatolian Hittite product, and lakovidis may well be correct in suggesting it to be a Cypriot imitation by an illiterate craftsman.45 12) A cylinder seal (BM GR 1872.15.3 = BM no. 109; P1. XXVIII c) of sintered quartz with well-preserved green glaze was found in an LH IIIC tomb (unnumbered) at Ialysos, Rhodes.46 Both the material of the seal and the scene inscribed upon it indicate that the seal is probably of Mitannian manufacture. Seals of the so-called Mitannian "Common Style", produced primarily during the mid- second millennium B.C., are noted in part for their sintered quartz composition and couchant animals depicted tete-beche; both attributes are present in this seal.47 The origins of the seal should most likely be placed in North Syria, probably in or near Ras Shamra/Ugarit, where a workshop producing similar seals has come to light.48 13-15) Two stamp seals and a ring (P1.

It is probably of "Neo-Hittite" rather than "New Empire Hittite" manufacture and is in too late a context for inclusion in these discussions; see Boardman (1966) 48, figs. 3-4; also von der Osten (1937) 414-20, figs. 476-7 and Buchanan (1967) esp. 21 n. 16 for parallels. 46Walters (1926) 20 (no. 150), pl. 3; Buchholz (1967) 153 (no. 7) with references; Pini (1983) 119 (no. 16), abb. 2:6; Collon (1987) 62-3 (no. 259). 47Porada (1980) 11-12; Pini (1983) 120-1; Collon (1987) 61-2, with illustrated parallels. 48See Collon (1987) 62 with references. A close parallel is seal R.S. 25.381 from Ras Shamra-Ugarit; see Schaeffer (1983) 153. I am indebted to Professor E. Porada for bringing this parallel to my attention. Seal R.S. 23.379 (ibid. 152) is also similar. 139</page><page sequence="8">ANATOLIAN STUDIES Arthur Evans and donated to the Ashmolean Museum.49 They are probably not Hittite. These designs are not to be found either in Hogarth's monograph on Hittite seals or in more recent works. The provenance given is Palaiokastro, near Neapolis in Laconia. Unfortunately, as Waterhouse and Hope Simpson note, this site does not appear to have been inhabited in ancient times. 16) Iron objects found in Bronze Age contexts within the Aegean, for which many previous investigators automatically assumed Hittite origins, must be removed from this category. Recent studies have shown that such objects were also made locally by the Minoans and the Mycenaeans or could have been imported from Syro-Palestine or Egypt in addition to Anatolia.50 * * * Summary The above catalogue lists all of the so-called "Hittite" objects found in the Bronze Age Aegean. Of these twenty-three, only eight cannot readily be excluded as being of origins other than Central Anatolian. The eight are scattered over the Bronze Age Aegean both areally and temporally, from MM I-II to LH IIIC and from Mainland Greece to Rhodes. They constitute, at best, only one percent of all the Orientalia found in the Bronze Age Aegean. Hypotheses to account for the paucity of Central Anatolian Hittite artifacts in the Mycenaean and Minoan worlds, and for the parallel lack of Mycenaean and Minoan artifacts in the Hittite homelands of Central Anatolia, are currently under investigation. They may include a simple lack of need for reciprocal trade, a trade in perishable goods, an economic embargo, or a combination of the above. The issues are far from resolved, and it is likely that more deeply-rooted socio-economic or socio-political factors will need to be examined as possible explanations. For the time being, regardless of the direction of future research, scholars continuing to investigate the nature of Hittite-Mycenaean interactions must remain aware that true Central Anatolian "Hittite" objects are far more rare in the Bronze Age Aegean than has been generally assumed, and must be prepared to include and address this issue in their discussions.
