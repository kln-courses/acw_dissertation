<plain_text><page sequence="1">A response: More on use of animals Thurman S. Grafton The article by Michael W. Fox and M. Andrea Ward indicates correctly that the National Society for Medical Research has an interest in the science fair programs of secondary schools. From that point on, it degenerates, I feel, into the kind of pro paganda commonly used by anti vivisectionists employing the strategy of the "big lie." While not wishing to dignify the arti cle with a point-by-point refutation, I can, for purposes of understanding, identify the "big lies" as follows: 1. Through anthropomorphism, anti vivisectionists (and especially those in the social sciences) ascribe to all animals the The author, a doctor of veterinary medicine, is executive director of the National Society for Medical Research. same feelings experienced by man. Thus, anything that they think would make humans feel unhappy is interpreted as causing "pain and suffering" when applied to an animal. 2. When the authors refer to special science fair projects, they blithely but purposefully neglect to mention the use of anesthetic, analgesic, or tranquilizing drugs where appropriate. The 1977 International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) sponsored by Sci ence Service, Inc., was my first official connection with that endeavor. My previ ous contact had been as a parent of par ticipating students and as a qualified biomedical scientist supervising student projects. In orienting me to the responsibilities of the Animal Experimentation Commit tee, the other members were very candid in describing some of the early problems that had been encountered. Generally, these were due to over-ambitious proj ects, beyond the capabilities of the stu dent and conducted with inadequate supervision. Over the years most of these problems have been corrected. The rules of the 29th ISEF1 (to be held in California in May 1978) have undergone another re vision based upon the 1977 experience. The National Society for Medical Re search supports the fundamental princi ple of allowing interested students to conduct experiments with animals at the secondary school level. We appreciate the importance of recognizing scientific curiosity, and the need to motivate, en courage, and nurture this interest, so as to channel into higher education, students who will be capable of fulfilling society's needs for scientists and other health pro fessionals. A suggestion There is a basic administrative problem area which I would like to mention here—namely, that the one or two exhi bits at the International Fair which caused the Animal Experimentation Committee most difficulty were ones in which what ever fault may have been involved was that of either the supervising teacher or the qualified biomedical scientist, but not of the student. The problem arises because the ISEF rules technically apply only to it and to affiliated fairs; other fairs may make their own rules. And while some local rules (and enforcement) may be excellent, all are not. Therefore, I would like to suggest strongly that all science fairs adopt the rules of the ISEF, on the assumption that every local project entered may ultimately reach the international level. The ISEF's new rules have been care fully edited by the Animal Experimenta tion Committee, which now consists of science teachers and nationally recog nized veterinarians associated with both animal welfare and laboratory animal medicine. Their work has resulted in changes in the rules to underscore certain restrictions felt essential to the continued approval of experiments with animals. The single most important of these new rules has to do with the clear definition of the supervision required for different types of projects. For example: No experiment may be undertaken that in volves anesthetics, drugs, thermal proce dures, physical stress, organisms pathogenic to man or other vertebrates, ionizing radia tion, carcinogens, or surgical procedures, un less these procedures are performed under the direct supervision of an experienced and qualified biomedical scientist or designated adult supervisor. While it is unrealistic to expect that every student project will produce hitherto unknown scientific knowledge for the advancement of science, it is still important that sponsoring teachers dis courage those projects which have been repeated so many times that the outcome is obvious even to the student. Super visors should also insure that the rules are not only read, but understood by the stu dent. Displays of projects should be planned so they are suitable for public viewing. One of the principal desired learning outcomes of any animal project should be, in the words of Albert Schweitzer, "a rev erence for life." Supervisors should at all times strive to inspire this appreciation in students. The first sign that a student is developing a callous attitude toward liv ing things should be dealt with im mediately; to allow it to continue would tend to destroy one of the strongest motivations for pursuing a scientific career. The development of future genera tions of scientists is a responsibility shared by teachers as well as by members of the scientific and health professions. It is indeed an undertaking which may well determine the quality of life of future generations. ■ 1 Available from Science Service, Inc., 1717 N St. NW, Washington, DC 20036 for 50 cents a copy.
