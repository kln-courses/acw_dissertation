<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peirce's Conception of God: A Developmental Study Donna M. Orange Peirce Studies, Number 2, Institute for Studies in Pragmaticism, Lubbock, Texas, Sept. 1984 96 pp. The unpretentiousness of this book is refreshing. The author ac- knowledges personal motivation for her work: students' and friends' questions about her belief in God, and fascination with a conception of God credible to the "exact logician" and practicing scientist, Charles Sanders Peirce. Admitting limitations in her study, Orange writes: "I am neither mathematician nor scientist, and must leave it to others to fill in the gaps in my work." She purports to provide mainly "a work of assemblage," and is admirably successful in doing that. Orange does more, however, because her own interpretations of Peirce's state- ments are presented cogently, enriched through her knowledge of the secondary literature, and the critical input of a number of im- portant Peirce scholars such as Max Fisch, Vincent Potter and Kenneth Ketner. Possibly I am biased in praising this revised dissertation because the author's interpretation generally coincides with my own: despite shifts in Peirce's views throughout his lifetime, he maintained a con- sistent conception of God. There were changes such as Orange chron-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 431 icles, to be sure, but these were developmental differences rather than essential mutations. Peirce's consistency is not only theoretical but practical, which is why Orange prefers the term "conception" to "idea" or "notion" or "concept." The term "conception" refers to "the rational purport of a word or other expression (which) lies ex- clusively in its conceivable bearing upon the conduct of life" (CP 5.412). In light of that definition, "conception" captures the integral connection between thought and action which characterized Peirce's philosophy and life. Orange illustrates the connection by interweaving her theoretical analysis with references to biographical data. Acknowledging that Peirce would not have used the term, Orange labels the content of her book "philosophical theology." By that she means "inquiry into the being and nature of a deity," an enter- prise distinct from "philosophy of religion" (p. viii). The latter area of investigation would embrace (among other topics) the criticisms of churches and theologians which are scattered throughout Peirce's writings. Her emphasis on the deity enables Orange to write a more positive account than would be possible in dealing with Peirce's thoughts about religious insitutions. Nonetheless, that account forms the basis not only of Peirce's but also of others' criticisms of churches and theologians, suggesting that philosophy of religion and philosoph- ical theology may not be separable after all. Orange divides her study into five chapters covering four periods (pre-1867, 1867-1887, 1887-1900, and 1900-1914), and concluding with a summary of Peirce's conception of God as reasonableness. The breakdown is not related to logical developments in Peirce's phi- losophy such as those recounted by Murphey; it merely exhibits the author's sense of conceptually separable material which corresponds to the designated chronology. Texts used for each period are drawn mainly from Peirce's Harvard manuscripts (with references accord- ing to the numeration of R. S. Robin's Annotated Catalogue ,1967) and from The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, 1935 (C. Hartshorne and P. Weiss) and 1958 (A. Burks). Other text sources include C. S. Hardwick's Semiotic and Signifies: The Correspondence between Charles S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby (1977), K. Ketner's and J. Cook's Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to the Nation</page><page sequence="3">432 Book Reviews (1975-79), and C. Eisele's The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce (1976). In each chapter except the last, quotations are used liberally and lengthily, the author's own contribution serving principally as exegesis for the texts. On the whole, this method is credible and useful for both beginner and expert in Peircean themes. Early influences discussed include Peirce 's Unitarian upbringing and Episcopalian conversion (1862), typifying together his rejection of dogmatism and appreciation for religious worship. Kant, according to Orange, was Peirce's "principal reference point and dialogue part- ner" during the years in which he was developing the categories that eventually became his "New List." The dialogue continued through Peirce's study of Henry Longueville Mansel, the Kantial apologist who held that reason is useless in the area of religion. It bore fruit in Peirce's articulation of his own position as "realistic pantheism," which rejected Kantian dualism by asserting that Matter, Mind and God are mutually both exclusive and inclusive. The move from Kant brought Peirce to Hegel, and to possibilities for a synthetic, evolution- ary view of the world and history. Orange recognizes that Peirce was mainly occupied with his sci- entific work and teaching logic during the 1870's - 80's. Nonethe- less, even that work may be linked with Peirce's conception of God. In the third of his 1868 articles in the Journal of Speculative Phi- losophy Peirce used religious language to describe the scientist's self- less commitment to the truth. "[E]ven the revelation of the pos- sibility of this complete self-sacrifice in man, and the belief in its saving power, will serve to redeem the logicality of all : men" (p. 26, Orange's italics). The redemption from ignorance is accomplished by a community of inquirers who pursue the "ideal perfection of knowl- edge" which Peirce ultimately identified with God (p. 28). Another source which Orange examines carefully is "The Order of Nature," in which Peirce criticizes "theologians of evidence" who purport to demonstrate the existence of a "governor of the universe." At the same time he clearly accepts "Vacherot's conception of God as the perfect, or as the supreme ideal, together with Vacherot's con- viction that such a deity may be an object of worship" (p. 32). The key to legitimizing Orange's interpretation of Peirce is this recog-</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 433 nition of religion as practical, and God as the perfection of truth towards which science tends. The author might have made that clearer had she distinguished explicitly between the concepts of religion and God that Peirce ^criticized, and those that were consistent with each other and with his scientific pragmatism. It is precisely Peirce's views about science, logic and nature that present the possibility but not the necessity of consistency between early and later Peircean views, and between his positions on, and practice of, science and religion. The next period of which Orange writes is Peirce's early years at "Arisbe" in Milford, Pennsylvania. The author sees Peirce as then maintaining a sense of complementarity between science and religion. For example, consider Peirce's statement in The Nation in the early 1890's: "Many great scientists go to church, and are there very un- like what they are in their laboratories. At one time they are studying one aspect of truth, at another time another" (N 1: p. 155). Peirce's effort to explain the unity of truth led to his doctrine of synechism and evolutionary love. According to Orange, his conception of God "grew to include the Absolute as end of the evolutionary process" (p. 41). By 1892, however, Peirce had begun to identify the meta- physical Absolute with a personal God, one who is the object of re- ligious experience. He could write "The Marriage of Religion and Science" (1893) in light of that recognition. He could also correlate the scientific altruism recommended earlier with the gospel of love recommended by Christianity. The scientific individualism which he condemned as illogical was identified with the "gospel of greed" (p. 45). In the latter part of Peirce's Arisbe years (1896-1900), Peirce's views took on a more idealistic emphasis, which Orange attributes to his "new respect for Plato and Hegel" (p. 50). Surely the writings of Josiah Royce were also influential in this regard. Peirce had but recently written a lengthy, critical review of Royce's The Religious Aspect of Philosophy, intended for, but not accepted by, Popular Science Monthly. Orange remarks that Peirce may be even more an idealist than Royce. In any case, a new convergence between science and religion, the absolute Truth and God, were possible in</page><page sequence="5">434 Book Reviews light of a conception of the "summum bonum" as the ultimate end or ideal, "neither specifically psychical nor physical, an order or ration- ality which makes other things good, useful, or reasonable, and makes sense of the evolutionary process" (p. 56). Peirce's "final opinion" about God represents a culmination of his life-long struggle, both personal and professional, towards integration. Orange admits that her use of the term "final opinion" is loose and ironic, since truth or reality was for Peirce "the opinion which the community of investigators would discover and agree upon if investi- gation were indefinitely prolonged" (p. 58). God was still a hypothe- sis for Peirce, but a "highly confirmed hypothesis" (p. 58). His phi- losophical development had brought him to a point where his belief in God could be put "less crudely" (Ms 641). The integration was never fully achieved because Peirce continued to recognize a difference between science and religion, between the Absolute towards which philosophers reached, and the God worshipped by believers. In 1906, as Orange recounts, Peirce wrote: "whether there be an Absolute or not, it is nothing like God" (Ms 857). Peirce's disagreement with Royce lay precisely in the latter's having affirmed the integration as demonstrable through reason. The biography of Peirce probably better approximates an integration between philosophy and religion than do his writings. On a conceptual level, Orange claims that "reasonableness" epito- mizes not only the ideal outcome of evolution but also of Peirce's normative sciences - esthetics, ethics, and logic. As an ideal it re- mains inaccessible but approachable. It is also an anthropomorphic concept, which legitimizes the conception of God as person, especially in the context of Peirce's category of Thirdness through which persons are identified as symbols, or "generals." Orange observes that Peirce's theism finally rests on the realism of his theory of categories. In the final few pages of the book, Orange mentions several ob- jections to Peirce's conception of God - e.g., it is enigmatic, non- falsifiable, and "too exclusively intellectual" (p. 91). Although this section is entitled "Critical Assessment," it is hardly critical in a nega- tive sense. To each objection Orange responds by elaborating responses that Peirce might have made. The reader's understanding both of</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 435 Peirce and of the standpoint from which the author interprets Peirce might have been enhanced especially through fuller, more critical analysis of two problematic concepts which are crucial to Peirce's philosophy in general, and his conception of God in particular. One is the meaning of, and relation between, Peirce's idealism and realism; the other is the pantheism which he at times admits and at other times eschews. No doubt Orange is well aware of how related these concepts are to each other as well as to her interpretation of Peirce. Case Western Reserve University Mary B. Mahowald</page></plain_text>
