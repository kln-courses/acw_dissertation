<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 6 Re-membering Sirius: animal death, rites of mourning, and the (material) cinema of spectrality RSieri-umsembering George Ioannides This chapter aims to map out the theorisations of spectrality and ma- teriality, and of presence and non-presence, which attend the represent- ation of the dead animal body on film. Through an exploration of the work of John Berger, Akira Lippit and Jonathan Burt, I argue that the filmic image of animal death is a form of ‘rupture’ (Burt 2000, 11) in the field of visual representation. This chapter begins with the notion of the visual animal, explicated through the work of Berger, to reveal when, how, and why the transformation of animals into absent referents takes place. It then tracks the genealogies of spectrality, in accordance with the work of Lippit, and those of materiality, in accordance with the work of Burt, that adhere to the question of what it means to screen the death of an animal. Concepts of the spectral animal suggest that there is no proper death of the animal and no death as such in cinema, but instead, a phantasmic spectacle linked to cinema through its repetit- ive function of (re)animation. Notions of the material animal, however, speak of the affective agency of the cinematic animal vis-à-vis its hu- man observer, including the material-semiotic, historical, embodied traces that leave open issues of grief and mourning for the nonhuman animal’s now-absent presence. Is the dead animal on screen, therefore, G Ioannides (2013). Re-membering Sirius: animal death, rites of mourning, and the (material) cinema of spectrality. In J Johnston &amp; F Probyn-Rapsey (Eds). Animal death. Sydney: Sydney University Press. 103 </page> <page sequence="2"> Animal death to be understood as spectral, a phantasm, captured on film and en- shrined in loops of movement? Or is there something more corporeal at play, the materiality and contingency of an individual animal that left a trace that is embodied and that should, perhaps, be mourned? It is here, in the confluence of these suppositions, that this chapter seeks to find a space for a more nuanced theorisation of the simultaneous spectrality and materiality of the dead animal body on film. This will be demon- strated through a close reading of Sirius remembered (1959), a short silent film by the American avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, that shows the body of his dead pet dog decomposing in the forest, and which highlights the necessity to view the undeadness of the spectral subject, and the material corporeality of the pictured subject, when ex- amining animal death on screen. The visual animal attests to spectrality as well as materiality, signalled by its absent presence (and present ab- sence) in today’s human–animal entangled condition. The visual animal I begin with the eminent art historian and novelist John Berger’s essay ‘Why look at animals?’ (1980), published over three decades ago, which remains a landmark exploration of modernity’s relationship to animals and the vicissitudes of their cultural and conceptual visibility (see Pick 2011, 103). The central thesis of Berger’s piece concerns the gradual fading of the modern animal from everyday life; according to Berger, ‘everywhere animals disappear’ (1980, 26), and the most obvious mani- festation of this thesis can be seen in the gradual yet recently acceler- ated disappearance and destruction of many forms of animal life from our planet. A differing manifestation of this thesis of ‘disappearance,’ however, concerns the representation of animals, and it is this mediat- ised line of inquiry into animal death which shall be taken up in this chapter. For Berger, industrial capitalism ruptured the once intimate re- lationship between humans and other animals; the intensification of agriculture distanced farmers from their livestock, and urbanisation separated city-dwellers from wild and rural nature (Armstrong 2011, 175‒76). ‘Real’ animals disappeared and were ‘effaced’, to be replaced by forms of virtual animality such as spectacle, anthropomorphic rep- 104 </page> <page sequence="3"> 6 Re-membering Sirius resentations, and animal imagery, where animals were either overlaid with metaphors of human characteristics or became the bearers of purely human concerns. As the ‘animals of the mind’ could not ‘be so easily dispersed’ (Berger 1980, 15), therefore, the material marginalisa- tion of animals in modernity was accompanied by the proliferation of conceptual animals where, as they vanished from physical reality, they multiplied in the human psyche (Armstrong 2011, 189). ‘One could suppose’, Berger argued, that such innovative visualisations of animals ‘were compensatory’ (1980, 26); animals have here disappeared in their ‘essential original form’ and have been replaced by ‘symbols’ (Aloi 2012, 12; see also Armstrong 2011, 175–76, 188–89). Yet even these virtual animals ‘have been coopted into other categories so that the category animal has lost its central importance’ (Berger 1980, 15). When in- dustrial modernity is thought through with animals, then, ‘animals are always the observed. The fact that they can observe us has lost all sig- nificance. They are the objects of our ever-extending knowledge’ (16). As Anat Pick so eloquently states, the disappearance of animals from daily life has rendered them completely visible by re-presenting them as objects of mastery and knowledge, an action that, ironically, has only intensified under the conditions of their endangerment (2011, 104). It is here where the Bergerian thesis of the representative ‘disappearance’ of animals bleeds into, and creates a space for, an investigation of the presence of death, dying, and decomposition found at numerous levels of inquiry into animal representation. The spectral animal Akira Lippit’s work professes its debt to Berger in the opening sentence of his book Electric animal: ‘Everywhere animals disappear’ (2000, 1). Lippit follows Berger in his account of the way modernity dissolves the empirical animal into pure spectrality, proposing a link between anim- als and technology, and showing that the fate of the animal in mod- ernity is bound up with its representation as a filmic image: ‘animals never entirely vanish’ but ‘exist in a state of perpetual vanishing’ (2000, 1). For Lippit, ‘animals enter a new economy of being during the mod- ern period, one that is no longer sacrificial in the traditional sense of the term but, considering modern technological media generally and the 105 </page> <page sequence="4"> Animal death cinema more specifically, spectral’ (2000, 1). Moreover, in his follow-up article published in Film Quarterly, Lippit states: ‘Cinema is an an- imal, animality a form of technology, technology an aspect of life. A life forged in the radical reanimation of the conditions of vitality as such’ (2002, 20). In the words of Nicole Shukin, therefore, Lippit ‘theorises animals as undying spirits that survive their mass historical “vanish- ing” within modernity to be reincarnated in the technological media’ (2009, 40–41). As animals vanish from historical modernity, a spirit or trace of animality is salvaged by the media of technology, where cinema, even more consummately than linguistic metaphor, ‘mourns’ vanishing animal life, preserving or encrypting animality in an affective and transferential structure of communication (Lippit 2000, 196; see also Shukin 2009, 40–41). Such a structure of human–animal commu- nicative affect, that survives the historical disappearance of animals to transmigrate into the cinematic apparatus (Shukin 2009, 41), is evinced by the early cinematic concern with documenting animal death and is demonstrated by the early pioneer of film Thomas Edison’s Electrocut- ing an elephant (1903). In January 1903, Edison helped choreograph the public electrocu- tion of Topsy, a six-tonne elephant on exhibit at Coney Island’s Luna Park. Topsy was electrocuted with 6,600 volts of alternating current (AC) to propagandise the mortal dangers of George Westinghouse’s competing system of electricity, at the same time as promoting Edison’s own ‘safer’ system of direct current (DC). Indeed, Topsy’s execution came to constitute several seconds of some of the earliest live footage captured by moving picture cameras. The 60-second film-clip shows the elephant moving into the foreground of the shot and shuffling its feet, which then begin to smoke as she is administered a surging bolt of electricity. In quick succession the animal collapses, briefly quivers, and is rendered motionless (Sheehan 2008, 120). To say here that the film merely documents the death of the elephant, according to Lippit, is not quite true. Instead, an uncanny transference has taken place through the recording of the event of death, illuminating a ‘spectral metaphysic of technology’ (2002, 13). The film recording, as it were, ‘transfers the anima of the animal, its life, into a phantom archive . . . The animal survives its death as a film, as another form of animal, captured by the technologies of animation’ (Lippit 2002, 13, 19; see also Sheehan 2008, 120). No longer present in the flesh, animals such as Topsy are 106 </page> <page sequence="5"> 6 Re-membering Sirius instead ‘recorded, captured on film, enshrined in loops of movement’, neither dead nor alive but spectral, phantasmic, undead (Reinert 2012). Modern technology, in this reading, appears as ‘a massive mourning apparatus, summoned to incorporate a disappearing animal presence that could not be properly mourned’ (Lippit 2000, 188). Animal death on film preserves the presence of an animal that cannot ‘properly’ die. Supposedly oblivious to its own death, impossible to mourn, and dis- located from its own materiality, it is transformed into flickering loops and circuits of light and motion (Reinert 2012). What is meant here, however, by a ‘proper death’? In the con- cluding discussion of Killing animals by the Animal Studies Group, Jonathan Burt writes that ‘it’s almost as though the closer and closer you get to animal killing, the more everything begins to fall apart, perspective and everything’. To this, Steve Baker adds: ‘And language’ (2006, 209). For Lippit, in the filmic image of death, the animal dies beyond the reach of language, so it cannot ‘die’ as such. It cannot die because, according to particular philosophical discourses of the animal, it does not possess language, and therefore cannot know or name its death. A ‘canonical figure of the undead animal’ thus takes shape across a variety of texts that ‘in different ways consign animals to a spectral existence outside of the possibility of language’, and outside of the ho- rizon of death (Shukin 2009, 134; see also Lippit 2000, 27–73). Georges Bataille states, for instance, that ‘What marks us [humans] so severely is the knowledge of death, which animals fear but do not know’ (1991, 82). According to Martin Heidegger, furthermore, ‘To die means to be capable of death as death. Only man [sic] dies. The animal perishes. It has death neither ahead of itself nor behind it’ (1971, 178). Here, language ‘brings consciousness and with it, the consciousness of con- sciousness and its absence, or death. In this light, to have language is to have death. Without language, according to this sophism, animals have neither consciousness nor death’ (Lippit 2002, 11).1 The animal never ‘dies,’ moreover, because its purported inability to die is reflec- ted in cinema’s essential feature, its reanimating function, where cinema 1 Of note is Lippit’s continuation of this quote: ‘It should be stated definitively . . . that animals do have language. Philosophical conceptions of language, linked to untenable notions of subjectivity, consciousness, and self, have failed to accommodate the language of animals as language’ (2002, 11–12). 107 </page> <page sequence="6"> Animal death repeats ‘each unique death until its [the animal’s] singularity has been erased, its beginning and end fused into a spectral loop’ (Lippit 2002, 12). In that manner, against ‘the impossibility of animal death, cinema provides artificial life, anima, animation, and the possibility of rean- imation’ (Lippit 2002, 12), keeping the animal ‘alive’. Separated from the consciousness of language, therefore, the animal cannot undergo a ‘proper death’. The material animal Lippit’s analysis of animals as supposedly incapable of death shows the animal ‘persisting as spectre and trace in the body of cinematic technology’ (Pick 2011, 108). Jonathan Burt in his Animals in film (2002), however, posits a divergent theorisation of the visual animal, one that sees the cinematic animal as acutely suspended ‘on the bor- derline between technological artifice and corporeal reality’ (Pick 2011, 116; see also Burt 2001, 2005, 2006). Lippit’s Electric animal (2000), ac- cording to Burt, tends to regard the animal as a ‘pure sign’, which, in turn, ‘reinforces at a conceptual level the effacement of the animal that is perceived to have taken place in reality even whilst criticising that process’ (2002, 29; see also Burt 2005, 215). The theory that the animal is becoming increasingly ‘virtual’, that its fate is to disappear into tech- nological reproduction to become nothing more than imagery, would make sense ‘were it not for the fact that this imagery is not uniform but unavoidably fragmented, both in terms of the technical variety of its reproduction and in terms of the various conflicts around the image itself ’ (Burt 2002, 87). By emphasising the existence of a variety of (at times contrasting) constellations of looks between humans and anim- als, and of different regimes of visibility for the animal in the modern public sphere, the visual animal is reclaimed as a potentially positive presence (Pick 2011, 108). The agency of the cinematic animal is asser- ted, not in the sense of animal subjectivity, but in terms of the animal’s affective power vis-à-vis the human observer in its material, corporeal form (Pick 2011, 109). It is of note that the animal bodies that Lippit discusses are tech- nologically enshrined and encrypted in much more material ways than he allows; until well into the last century, for instance, film photography 108 </page> <page sequence="7"> 6 Re-membering Sirius depended on the properties of gelatine, a substance rendered from an- imal bodies (Shukin 2009). According to Shukin, ‘it is here, in the ma- terial convolutions of film stock, that a transfer of life from animal body to technological media passes virtually without notice’; the ‘material- symbolic rendering of animals . . . helped to leverage cinema into his- torical existence’ (2009, 104). Moreover, the subjects that are photo- graphed, or filmed, affectively touch on the general conditions of ma- terial being. Filmed photographs show not just the undeadness of the spectral subject, but also the materiality and contingency of the afore- mentioned subject-animal (Pick 2011, 114–15). Nonhuman animals are also material-semiotic and historical pres- ences with whom we live our lives; as animals are inextricably bound up with human activity, they are historical not only like humans, but with them (Csicsery-Ronay 2010, 152). Humans and animals here in- teract with interdependent embodied traces, where these animals and the traces that they create function as historical actors of their own. In attempting to write about (dead) animals, then, we must depend on ‘tracks, trails, or traces – those material-semiotic remnants . . . and of- ten unintentional indexes of a now-absent presence’ (Benson 2011, 3). In the presence of death, we must instead forge a relationship with the embodied traces of past animal life, including a relationship open to notions of grief and mourning. Humans, to be sure, often grieve the dogs and other animals they live with; they grieve them not necessar- ily because they are humanised, but because they transcend boundaries of kin and kind by becoming integral to their lives as social partners (rather than as ‘resources’) (Weil 2012, 115).2 There are those who have lived with animals and are ‘undone’ by the animals they have lost, and many have witnessed animals who similarly seem to lose a part of themselves when they lose their animal others (see Weil 2012, 144; Butler 2004, 23; and Stanescu 2012). Contra Lippit, who valorises cinema as a salvaging apparatus that shelters or encrypts vanishing ‘an- imal traits as a gesture of mourning’ (2000, 196), it is thus evident that animals can be mourned by and like humans themselves. Lippit prob- lematically elides the persistent materiality of the dead animal body on film; at the same time, however, he marvellously manages to capture 2 See Chur-Hansen et al. (2011) for the rites and rituals particularly associated with companion animal death that might leave traces of certain animals ‘behind’. 109 </page> <page sequence="8"> Animal death some crucial aspect of the condition of animals in our vicissitudinous modernity, where the animal image is understood as a symptom of a deeper, more permanent loss. Indeed, in taking such embellishments of Berger, Lippit, and Burt’s theories into the realm of the visual representation of animal death, we see it as a form of ‘rupture’ (Burt 2000, 11) in the field of representation. An attempt must be made to think through the co-constitutive spectral- ity and materiality of visual animal death and the dead visual animal, and it is an examination of Sirius remembered, a 12-minute silent short made in 1959 by the filmmaker Stan Brakhage that, this chapter argues, offers such a realisation. Sirius and spectrality For this film, Sirius remembered, Brakhage placed the body of his de- ceased dog, Sirius, in the woods near his house and filmed the corpse at various stages of decomposition over several seasons, where it froze in the winter and rotted in the spring. The title of the film puns on the memory and reconstruction of Sirius and his extremities (or ‘mem- bers’).3 In Brakhage’s own words: There are three parts to the film: first there is the animal seen in the fall as just having died, second there are the winter shots in which he’s become a statue covered with snow, and third there’s the thaw and decay. That third section is all REmembered where his members are put together again. All previous periods of his existence as a corpse, in the fall, the snow, and the thaw are gone back and forth over, re- capitulated and interrelated. (1963; quoted in Elder 1998, 214) Of note in this discussion of the film is Brakhage’s attempt to reanimate Sirius, and it is here, through its filmic techniques, that the film’s rep- resentation and reanimation of the dead animal finds the greatest cor- relation with Lippit’s theories of the filmic revivification of the dead or 3 The film exists in two parts online; see ‘Andyfshito’ (2007a; 2007b). 110 </page> <page sequence="9"> 6 Re-membering Sirius dying animal through cinema’s essentially reanimating, captive, and re- petitive function. Particularly in this film but also throughout his oeuvre, Brakhage develops a powerful set of devices for emphasising motion and, as befits the subject of spectrality, for disembodying movement. The film is defined by a formal reflexivity that continuously calls attention to Brakhage’s direct intervention in every frame, through gestural camera movement, painting and scratching on the film emulsion, and rapid- fire editing (see Kase 2012, 4). According to R Bruce Elder, only ‘in a small portion of the shots’ that appear in the film is the camera ‘static (or nearly static)’, and often Brakhage’s ‘camera movement is very rapid’; Brakhage employs various means ‘to create a difference between successive frames we perceive as a “jitter” ’; the footage of Sirius was shot on black-and-white but printed on colour stock, so that the images of the film take on a very faint and ‘ghostly’ appearance; he sometimes ‘blurs objects, either by defocusing or by swish-panning, to the end of de-realising objects and presenting pure motion’; he sometimes ‘com- poses his frames so that large areas are dark, with just a small portion illuminated’; and sometimes the exposed subject matter ‘is such a small portion of the whole’ that we cannot identify it, and ‘so we see the frame as a modulator of coloured light rather than as an image’ (Elder 1998, 276‒77). These devices have the powerful effect of converting the film from a medium that we first experience visually, to virtual kin- aesthetic phenomena (Elder 1998, 277).4 Moreover, because ‘there is often little consistency either in the content or in the visual forms that Brakhage presses into’ this work, we sometimes have the impression, while watching his film, that ‘any sort of image could follow any other sort ... Every successive shot appears as new and independent of those that preceded it’ (Elder 1998, 272). Sirius remembered thus elicits the sense of a continuous ‘presence’, where ‘perpetually regenerating forms that appear always on the brink of collapse but regenerate themselves at the beginning of each cut’ are used to engender such a sensation (Elder 1998, 271). Each new shot marks a new beginning, the affective equi- valent of rebirth. 4 Additionally, and of interest, see Tyler (1972, 204–05) for his negative review of the film as ‘a monotonously overexpanded rhythmic cycle of film shots on a strictly limited theme’. 111 </page> <page sequence="10"> Animal death Sirius’ rebirth is formed in the film’s constantly re-generating com- positions. The images are rapidly edited together into a repetitive and, in the words of Lippit, looping framework, so that the film ‘conveys the impression of death from many [different] angles rather than ever lingering on a single view or a single perspective’ (Howard 2011). An affective immediacy is achieved by camera movements that desperately attempt to reanimate Sirius; the editing of frames whose startling jux- tapositions strike directly upon the viewer’s senses (Shukin 2009, 102). The film features horizontal panning shots of Sirius’ decaying corpse as it lays in a field, with the camera literally swung over and across the body to propel it back into motion, and vertical pans of the trees and the sky of different lengths and velocities of movement (Kashmere 2004, 81) suggest the passage of Sirius’ spirit away from the terrestrial towards the transcendental.5 In addition to generating the silent film’s rhythmic pulse, these ‘opposing back-and-forth camera movements cause visual tension, obscuring our ability to “make sense” of the image. This tactic dovetails with the aims of defamiliarisation, to refresh per- ception and recast the familiar in an original light’ (Kashmere 2004, 81). Through repetition and counterpoint (achieved through inter-cut- ting stilled close-ups of Sirius’ disfigured face) we are able to complete the picture in our mind’s eye, to see it ‘fresh’, so to speak (Kashmere 2004, 81). Later, shots panning left and right, up and down, are su- perimposed to create a polyphonous rhythm. P Adams Sitney notes that the ‘second half of the film elaborates an intricate harmonics as the two layers of fugue-like rhythms play against one another’ (2002, 171). Sirius remembered is thus rhythmically tortured in its constant repetition, where the images of Sirius’ corpse ‘have the quality of genu- ine apparitions’ because of the way they ‘interrupt the camera’s wildly swooping arcs’; they are ‘experienced as perceptual events that impinge on the viewer’s entire sensorium’, where we find and re-find meaning through a process of re-encounter (Camper 2001, 70). The film, indeed, here evinces a high level of congruence with the spectral economy of the representative animal as exemplified by Lippit, transforming its ref- erent into an enduring undead state; ‘in the world of cinema, the animal lives on, survives’ (Lippit 2002, 18–19). This theory of filmic animal 5 Of note is how Brakhage (1963) saw his films as preoccupied with ‘birth, death, sex and the search for God’ (quoted in James 2005, 3). 112 </page> <page sequence="11"> 6 Re-membering Sirius death thus gains great momentum in an examination of the corpse of Sirius, reanimated as it is by repetitive loops of light and motion. Sirius and materiality It must be argued, however, that the emphasis on Sirius’ spectrality is to be tempered with an awareness of his lived materiality. It is true that the film views the corpse of Sirius as a corpse, ‘as nature or the real that resists history as it resists being drawn into narrative’ (Weil 2012, 38). Flies and maggots disregard death to eat from Sirius’ flesh, and the film proceeds to investigate the processes of life after death in the form of endless transformations of the body as it is eaten and weathered away; it is a study of time and especially of the incremental moments between life and death, if not of life in death (Weil 2012, 104). Death happens ‘not in a moment, but over time, denying the moment of “perishing” that for Heidegger defines animal death’ (Weil 2012, 106). Changes in weather, light, the earth, register on the body of Sirius, whose tactile materiality is brought into sharp focus. It is here, there- fore, that a more nuanced theorisation of visual animal death can be put to work, one that accounts for the animal that once existed within the temporal logics of its owners and of the human and nonhuman others who came into contact with him; an animal that was loved, cared for, and mourned for. It is interesting to note that Sirius, unlike some other nonhumans, left an embodied and historical trace of his life which, aside from the film itself, was captured in the words of certain humans who knew him. There are the words of Brakhage himself who, in his annotations to Sirius remembered, states: I was coming to terms with decay of a dead thing and the decay of the memories of a loved being that had died and it was undermining all abstract concepts of death. The form [of the film] was being cast out of probably the same physical need that makes dogs dance and howl in rhythm around a corpse. I was taking song as my source of inspiration for the rhythm structure, just as dogs dancing, prancing around a corpse, and howling in rhythm structures or rhythm-in- 113 </page> <page sequence="12"> Animal death tervals might be considered like thebirth [sic] of some kind of song. (2001, 226) Furthermore, in a three-page tribute poem by the filmmaker Chick Strand for a collection of essays, photographs, personal statements, and reminiscences about Brakhage, we do not just see, but sense, the traces left by Sirius. Strand ruminates: I remember Sirius/black dog/white dog/brown/speckled/dotted/ longtail, short tail/long hair or not, ears up, down, nose to the air, into a hole, alert/sniffing/dem bones, dem bones/drinking from the hose/the basso in the neighbourhood choir imitating ghost dogs/the smell of him/shaking himself dry, ears flapping/oh yes, he is loved and cared for . . . / . . . his dog tags tinkle and I am reassured/I love his . . . matted fur, his thunder and loving grunts . . . /Sirius-ur dog fell down somewhere in the forest having found his secret dying place, or what was pushed, dragged, knocked down shot down and the life went out of him/the man finds him like that, and sniffs him, brother dog/and time and the elements return the animal to the earth/the man watches and re-members. (2005, 150–51) It is thus evident, through such a trace, that Sirius remembered creates a beautiful, loving rite and ritual of mourning and meaning-making out of death, and the relation to the mutable, fallible, yet material nonhu- man subject-body (see Plate 2008, 72). The simultaneously dead and undead body of Sirius is transposed through the camera of Brakhage, which is then perceived by the cinematic body of the film viewer. Brakhage mourns, but the hope is that we mourn with him, to be moved to a corporeal response that may be no response at all, the effect of an immediate experience to the ritualised cinematic event (Plate 2008, 72, 77). Indeed, the ‘energy’ of Brakhage’s film, the ‘speed’ that characterises it, the ‘discontinuities’ it incorporates, the ‘out-of-fo- cus’ shooting and swish-pans which make the shot’s subject-matter of Sirius difficult to identity, the sense of the ‘form-in-evolution’ it imparts (which elicits the feeling that it ‘could take unlikely turns or depart in unforeseen directions’), work to ‘rivet the viewer’s attention into the visual flow’ (Elder 1998, 452). Brakhage’s film elicits a strong sense of scopic identification, encouraging the viewer to enter into his film, to 114 </page> <page sequence="13"> 6 Re-membering Sirius merge with its energy, and to participate in the flow of his shooting (Elder 1998, 451‒52). It is hoped that we feel every abrupt change that the film undergoes, every cut or every shift in intensity or direction (Elder 1998, 452). Brakhage crowds our viewing experience with the everyday, the ‘mundane’ and the material in images that, shot through filters or pro- jected out of focus, painted over or captured at an unnatural angle, make us look differently, affectively, at the materiality of such subjects as ‘a dog’ (Sheehan 2012, 120–21). The confrontation with the actual- ised body of Sirius, transposed through the camera, in the terms of Burt and in contrast to Lippit, agentially affects the aesthetically and synaes- thetically perceiving human body. The capacity of the cinematic image is not simply to represent a sense of the material contingency of the body of Sirius, but to make it present on the screen, giving movement to stillness as a form of remembrance, simultaneously rendered spec- tral, yet material. Conclusion Overall, via the confluence of the theories of animality, mortality and visuality analysed above, the animal comes to be more than a spectral and passive object of the human look, embodying the ‘extreme collapse between the figural and the real’ as questions about the cinematic an- imal and animal death arise at the point at which ‘fiction and reality collapse into one another’ (Burt 2002, 44, 161). This is not because an- imals metaphorise a human ontological lack; the history of the visual animal in connection with death attests to plenitude as well as spec- trality signalled by the animal image, arising in the correlation between cinema and the corporeal (Pick 2011, 109). In the visual representation of animal death or a dead animal, we witness the undeadness of the spectral subject, linked to cinema’s looping process of animation, re- animation, and the repetitive multiplicity of the animal and its death. Yet we also see the materiality and contingency of the pictured subject, an individual animal that left an embodied trace, a subject to be con- sidered and mourned on its own terms, within or without the networks of human–animal relations and the human(s) behind the camera. Sirius remembered demonstrates this all too well in its looping, repetitive re- 115 </page> <page sequence="14"> Animal death animation and filmic, regenerating compositions of Sirius as spectral subject, as well as, simultaneously, its affective ritualisation of mourn- ing and its attentiveness to Sirius as material, historical, and embodied.
