<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Wrath of Aeneas and the Triumph of the Son: VirgiPs Aegaeon and Paradise Lost GEORGE R BUTLER In Book 5 of Paradise Lost, the angel Raphael visits Adam in the Garden of Eden to warn him of the dangers posed by Satan. When Adam asks him for a detailed account of the dangers that confront him, Raphael considers the difficulties of relating "To human sense th1 invisible ex- ploits / Of warring Spirits" (PL 5.565-66). l The angel then decides that it would be best to explain supernatural happenings in natural terms, so that Adam may at least partly comprehend divine and demonic history: what surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineate so, By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, As may express them best, though what if Earth Be but the shadow of Heav'n, and things therein Each to other like, more than on Earth is thought? (PL 5.571-76) Raphael's words signify that the tale that follows is not a literal retelling of history, but a mythic presentation of divine truth. As part of his meta- phoric narrative, Raphael describes the War in Heaven. The climactic event of the celestial battle is the Son's transformation into a furious warrior who rides the Chariot of Paternal Deity and single-handedly routs Satan and the rebel angels out of Heaven and into Hell (PL 6.801-92). Since Christian teaching is at the heart of Raphael's story, Milton re- peatedly echoes the Bible. But because Raphael's myth is an attempt to COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES, Vol. 34, No. 2, 1997.

Scholars have argued that the Iliad and the Theogony are the prin- cipal sources for Milton's classical allusions in Paradise Lost 6. But little has been said about the importance of Virgil's Aeneid to Milton's War in Heaven. While Homer and Hesiod color the martial exploits of the rebel angels, the Aeneid, that most Christian of all pagan epics, functions as a veiled subtext within the narrative. The Son's routing of the demons is based on an analogous episode in Book 10 of the Aeneid, in which Aeneas rages triumphantly on the battlefield, conquering his foes. When Aeneas is at his most furious, Virgil compares him to Aegaeon, a monster from classical mythology (Aen. 10.565-70). Milton's description of the trium- phant Son recalls Virgil's comparison of Aeneas to Aegaeon and creates a complex commentary on Satan, the Son, Aeneas, and Turnus, and on classical and Christian heroism. During the Renaissance, the Iliad was the most influential classical account of epic warfare and is generally considered to be Milton's princi- pal ancient model for the War in Heaven. Milton knew the Iliad directly and indirectly. He was acquainted with Homer through Johannes Spondanus' Renaissance edition, George Chapman's translations, Henri Estienne's Thesaurus, and Eustathius' commentary, as well as through lit- erary works that had borrowed and interpreted Homeric material.2 "The martial dimension of the entire epic tradition," notes William M. Porter, "is called to account in Paradise Lost 6, perhaps especially Homer's theomachy in Iliad 21 and 22."3 Charles Martindale says, "In treating of war Milton turned inevitably to the Iliad." Paul Rovang has added, "Homeric epic and Hesiodic myth are of unquestionable importance to the section." "For the Battle in Heaven as a whole," says Barbara Kiefer Lewalski, "the Bard employs several generic frames, of which the Iliad is primary." So too, Stella Puree Revard and Francis C. Blessington have commented on echoes of Homer throughout Milton's poem.4 These stud- ies generally note that the demons embody characteristics of classical deities and heroes and that the rebellious angels thus contrast classical values with the Christian virtues of the angels who remain loyal to God. Mythological allusions appear most frequently in the first two books of Paradise Lost, where Milton's imitation of the classical epics is most obvi- ous. Satan and his legions are invariably linked to the classical epic he- roes, and the defiant, self-aggrandizing, glory-seeking Achilles emerges as Satan's Homeric counterpart. Thus the Iliad stands out as the most apparent classical subtext of the War in Heaven.</page><page sequence="3">VIRGIL'S AEGAEON AND PARADISE LOST 105 By fighting the demons, the good angels likewise participate in battles that are described in classical terms. The classical world thus describes the faithful angels as well as the fallen. Those who remain loyal to God march "to the sound / Of instrumental Harmony that breath'd / Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds" (PL 6.64-66). Michael brandishes a sword "from the Armory of God" (PL 6.321), and the angels "In Cubic Phalanx firm advanced entire, / Invulnerable, impenetrably arm'd" (PL 6.399-400). Finally, God tells his Son, Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheels That shake Heav'n's basis, bring forth all my War, My Bow and Thunder, my Almighty Arms Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out From all Heav'n's bounds into the utter Deep. (PL 6.71 1-16) Through the Son's participation in this classical battle, Milton invites a comparison of the Messiah to the heroes of ancient epics. Lewalski cites several parallels between Milton's Messiah and Homer's Achilles. Whereas Achilles is more powerful and violent than all other warriors (II. 21.214- 15), the Son, as God's agent, embodies omnipotence (PL 6.703-18). While Achilles stops the Achaeans from hurling their spears at Hector so that he may slay Hector single-handedly (II. 22.205-207), the Son halts the angels so that he may single-handedly defeat Satan and the entire demonic legion (PL 6.801-66). And while Achilles, like so many other Homeric heroes, strives to attain fame, the Son, says Lewalski, ob- tains unsurpassable glory when he rides the Chariot of Paternal Deity, conquers his foes, is lauded by the angels, and is received "into Glory" (PL 6.891) by his heavenly Father (127-28). The superficial actions of the Son recall those of Achilles, though the Son's underlying motives may differ from those of his classical counterpart. The Son fights to win glory for God, not for himself: O Father, O Supreme of heav'nly Thrones, First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou always seek'st To glorify thy Son, I always thee, As is most just; this I my Glory account, My exaltation, and my whole delight, That thou in me well pleas'd, declar'st thy will Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. (PL 6.723-29)</page><page sequence="4">106 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES And in the various parallels noted by Lewalski, the Son transcends Achilles more than he duplicates him. Milton values the courageous spirit of Homeric heroism, but he holds that true valor is the unselfish enact- ment of God's will.5 Though the Iliad helps illuminate the actions of the faithful angels as well as the fallen, Homer's epic posed certain problems for Milton. During the Renaissance, Achilles, Agamemnon, and Odysseus were mod- els of courage, leadership, and wisdom. Some critics, however, saw Achilles as barbaric, Agamemnon as tyrannical, and Odysseus as deceitful. "For the poets who took the Iliad as their model, Achilles in particular proved a stumbling block," says John Steadman. "Although they might retain the basic outline of his role as essential to the plot, they could hardly transfer his character whole cloth from Homer without incurring blame for celebrating a vicious hero."6 In basing his War in Heaven on the Iliad, Milton had to reconcile the sometimes pouting, sometimes brutal, al- ways self-centered Achilles with the paragon of Christian virtue, the Son and Messiah of biblical mythology. The superficial elements of Homer's epic, such as details of battles, could be used to describe the Son and the faithful angels, but many of the underlying values of the Homeric world clashed with those of the Christian Renaissance. Milton could turn to the Aeneid as an alternative to the values of the Iliad, for Virgil's epic was both a transformation of the Iliad and a work more consonant with Christianity. In the Iliad, the values of the Homeric world are summarized on the shield of Achilles, which depicts the world at war and at peace (II. 18.478-607). In the city at peace, the relative of a slain man argues that the killer has not sufficiently compensated him, and the dispute is resolved through law (II. 18.497-508). But in the city at war, which resembles Troy, bloodshed and discord take place without any apparent resolution (18.530-40). Virgil presents an analogous pas- sage in the Aeneid, where Vulcan and the Cyclopes forge the shield of Aeneas (8.424-53). The shield depicts the history of Italy and the future triumphs of Rome. In the center of the shield is the heroic Augustus Caesar, doing battle against Antony and the barbaric forces of Egypt. The grotesque gods of the Egyptians fight against Neptune, Venus, and Minerva, the anthropomorphic gods of the Romans. When Apollo looks down from the heavens and aims his bow, the forces of the East flee in terror. Augustus enters Rome triumphant, and from Apollo's temple he views a parade of conquered peoples (8.675-728). Virgil thus poses the peace and order of the Roman empire as a resolution to the strife of the Homeric city at war. The Homeric city at peace is made real and endur-</page><page sequence="5">VIRGIL'S AEG AEON AND PARADISE LOST 1 07 ing through the victory of Rome over the barbarians of the Orient. Virgil's depiction of the battle of Actium on the shield of Aeneas was popular throughout the Renaissance. Pedro de Ona uses the scene as a model in the Arauco domado (4.5-8); Alonso de Ercilla y Zuniga mentions the battle in his La Araucaria (23.77); and Juan Latino compares Actium to the battle of Lepanto in the Austriadis libri duo (1.2v, 2.20r).7 Thus Virgil's representation of the battle of Actium became a transformation of the brutality of the Homeric world into an empire at peace, and it developed into a popular motif in Renaissance epic poetry. A wealth of scholarship explores Milton's indebtedness to Virgil, and the broad similarities between the Aeneid and Paradise Lost have become a commonplace among Miltonists. As Mario A. Di Cesare has remarked, "Nobody would quarrel with the view that Vergil's Aeneid is the major 'literary model' for Paradise Lost."8 But while scholars have noted many parallels between Milton's War in Heaven and Homer's battle for Troy, far less has been said about Milton's use of the Aeneid in Paradise Lost 6. James A. Freeman makes passing references to Virgil throughout his study of Milton and European traditions of war, but he does not emphasize Milton's debt to the Aeneid. Michael Murrin, in his book on history and warfare in Renaissance epics, says hardly anything about Milton's use of Virgil. Revard, in her book devoted to the War in Heaven, says surpris- ingly little about Milton's appropriation of Virgil's poem. And while Arnold Stein thinks that Raphael's initial mention of the war in Paradise Lost 5.563-70 "seems to be an echo of Aeneas' polite prologue to Dido" in Aeneid 2.3-12, he says nothing more about the presence of Virgil in Raphael's narrative.9 David Quint, however, has argued that Milton's account "closely imitates Virgil's Actium," and that the description of the Son riding the Chariot of Paternal Deity recalls Virgil's Augustus, who battles Antony in a struggle between the West and the East (8.675- 728). Quint further observes that Milton combines the warfare of the Iliad and the Aeneid, so that the prolonged battle of the angels and the demons recalls the endless strife of Homer's epic, while the arrival of the Son makes possible a resolution of the conflict, much as Virgil's Augustus brings order to the barbaric East and peace to the world.10 Milton's edi- tors have also noted several instances in which Milton appropriates Virgil's language and imagery, so that the Aeneid always remains in the back- ground of Paradise Lost 6. Through Milton's description of the triumph of the Son, Virgil's Aeneid emerges more clearly as a likely classical subtext for the War in Heaven. The Aeneid and the heroism of Aeneas balance the bloodshed of the Iliad and the self-affirming victories of Homer's</page><page sequence="6">1 08 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Achilles, while the martial successes of Aeneas parallel the Son's resolu- tion of Milton's cosmic strife. The climax of the War in Heaven takes place when the Son ban- ishes Satan and the rebel angels from Heaven and casts them into the abyss. Though the Son is a version of the unconquerable Achilles, he is also an imitation of Aeneas, Virgil's adaptation of the Homeric hero. A close Virgilian parallel of the Son's routing of the demons is Aeneas' slaughter of the Rutulians after the death of Pallas, which is itself based on the furious warfare of Achilles after the death of Patroclus (16.843- 58). After killing Pallas, Turnus defiantly strips the corpse of its belt, leaving the body to be brought back to Aeneas. When he learns of Pallas' death, Aeneas violently rages on the battlefield, slaying a catalog of en- emy warriors, though Turnus is not among them (10.490-605). Aeneas' martial exploits in Book 10 create a critical episode. The massacre results from the actions of Turnus, though Turnus escapes death. But Virgil makes clear that Turnus' deeds will ultimately cause his complete destruction: "Turno tempus erit, magno cum optaverit emptum / intactum Pallanta, et cum spolia ista diemque / oderit" ["To Turnus shall come the hour when for a great price will he long to have bought an unscathed Pallas, and when he will abhor those spoils and that day"] (1 0.503-05 ).n The hour of Turnus' death eventually comes in Book 12, when Aeneas sc^s Pallas' belt draped on the shoulders of his grovelling foe. "Pallas te hoc volnere," says Aeneas before taking Turnus' life, "Pallas / immolÃ¢t et poenam scelerato ex sanguine sumit" [" Tis Pallas, Pallas who with this stroke sacrifices thee, and takes atonement of thy guilty blood!"] (12.948- 49). Unrestrained violence is central to the actions of Aeneas in Book 10 of Virgil's epic. In his account of the maniacal fighting of Aeneas, Virgil compares the hero to a grotesque creature, Aegaeon: Aegaeon qualis, centum cui bracchia dicunt centenasque manus, quinquaginta oribus ignem pectoribusque arsisse, Iovis cum fulmina contra tot paribus streperet clipeis, tot stringeret ensis: sic toto Aeneas desaevit in aequore victor, ut semel intepuit mucro. (10.565-70) [Even as Aegaeon, who, men say, had a hundred arms and a hundred hands, and flashed fire from fifty mouths and breasts, what time against Jove's thunders he clanged with as many</page><page sequence="7">VIRGIL'S AEG AEON AND PARADISE LOST 1 09 like shields, and bared as many swords; so Aeneas o'er the whole plain gluts his victorious rage, when once his sword grew warm.] Through the simile, Aeneas acquires the characteristics of a supernatural monster. The metamorphosis is both physical and psychological. While Aeneas does not grow 100 hands and 50 fire* breathing mouths, the simile clarifies his actions and gives him some of Aegaeon 's corporeal attributes. The physical change of Aeneas from mortal to monster is matched by his psychological transformation into a raging warrior who fights as passion- ately as he does dexterously. The comparison of Aeneas to Aegaeon takes place in the middle of Aeneid 10, shortly after Aeneas has begun to rage on the battlefield and before his climactic encounter with Lausus, the son of Mezentius. Early in his frenzy, Aeneas kills Magus, who begs him for mercy (521-36). Af- ter the comparison of Aeneas to Aegaeon, the hero slays Liger, who simi- larly pleads for his life (10.597-601 ). The simile shows that in killing the supplicants, Aeneas has changed from a rational human into an irratio- nal animal. The murder of Lausus is the culmination of Aeneas' animal- istic brutality. Lausus grieves after the death of Mezentius, whom Aeneas has just killed (10.789-90). The hero then slays Lausus, and he sees that Lausus embodied the same pietas for which Aeneas had been known: at vero ut voltum vidit morientis et ora, ora modis Anchisiades pallentia miris, ingemuit miserans graviter dextramque tetendit et mentem patriae strinxit pietatis imago. (Aen. 10.821-24) [But when Anchises' son saw the look on that dying face - that face so pale in wondrous wise - heavily he groaned in pity, and stretched forth his hand, as the likeness of his own filial love rose before his soul.] Aeneas temporarily becomes impius, and his sorrow over the death of Lausus marks the return of his pietas. His figurative transformation into Aegaeon is thus a dissolution of his identity. In his Aegaeon-like conduct, Aeneas is far removed from the ideal of Christian heroism. His behavior and bloodlust are more Homeric than Augustan or Christian, and he regresses into a brutal version of Achilles.</page><page sequence="8">1 10 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Gordon Williams has argued that after Aeneas kills Tarquitus (10.557- 60), his words recall those of Achilles and Odysseus, and Thomas Van Northwick says that the relationship of Aeneas and Pallas is based on that of Achilles and Patroclus.12 The capture of the sons of Sulmo and Ufens repeats Achilles' sacrifice of twelve youths to avenge Patroclus' death (II. 26-32) and the killing of Magus parallels Achilles1 slaying of Lycaon (II. 21.34-135), which takes place immediately after Achilles' capture of the young warriors. In becoming Aegaeon, Aeneas also be- comes Achilles, that Renaissance figure who must shape the Homeric model of Milton's War in Heaven, but who was a flawed exemplar of heroism in the seventeenth century. Aeneas' slaughter of Turnus' soldiers in Aeneid 10 marks the begin- ning of the victory of the Trojans. The battle is not the final victory, but the penultimate one. The War in Heaven is likewise not the final battle in Milton's Christian myth. The routing of the demons in Paradise Lost 6 and the Son's easy victory over Satan in the War in Heaven are only a prelude to the apocalypse. As Turnus' actions in Aeneid 10 eventually cause his death in Aeneid 12, Satan's rebellion will lead to his apocalyp- tic defeat. Like Turnus, who escapes the wrath of Aeneas in Aeneid 10, Satan escapes the full wrath of the Son during the War in Heaven. "Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd /His Thunder in mid Vol- ley, for he meant / Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n" (6.853- 55), says Milton in describing the Son's victory. In Paradise Lost, Milton follows Virgil by having the Son change form prior to the routing of Satan. "Whom thou hat'st, I hate," says the Son to his Father, "and can put on / Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, / Image of thee in all things" (6.734-36). Rather than march into battle, the Son rides the Chariot of Paternal Deity, "Itself instinct with Spirit" (6.752), and thus a manifestation of the divine essence. The Chariot, largely based on Ezekiel 1.4-6, is drawn by "four Cherubic shapes" with "four Faces each" (6.753). Their wings have eyes, as do the wheels of the Chariot (6.755). Victory sits at the Son's right hand, "And from about him fierce Effusion roll'd / Of smoke and bickering flame, and sparkles dire" (6.765-66). Though Milton's account contains biblical elements, his larger aim is to imitate Virgil. The Son assumes monstrous qualities through the Chariot that he rides; the grotesqueness of the Chariot, along with its flame and fire, parallels the role of Virgil's Aegaeon in ascribing terrifying attributes to Aeneas. The Son could have appeared as the "dreaded Infant" of "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity," who "Can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew" (222, 228), or he could</page><page sequence="9">VIRGIL'S AEGAEON AND PARADISE LOST 1 1 1 have appeared as the passive champion of Paradise Regained, who triumphs over Satan by standing still on a pinnacle (4-551-95). But instead of posing as the meekest of the meek, the Son accommodates his image to match the divine wrath directed toward the rebel angels. The Son's metamorphosis is completed just before he expels the de- mons from Heaven. Thus far, his more monstrous characteristics have really been qualities of the Chariot with which he is associated. But in preparation for his triumph, the Son "into terror chang'd / His countenance too severe to be beheld / And full of wrath bent on his Enemies" (PL 6.824-26). Milton's colorless description repeats the meaning of Virgil's simile. In the Aeneid, the figure of Aegaeon is a poetic way of saying that Aeneas' wrath was supernaturally terrifying. The simile ascribes infinite fury to a mortal being and exemplifies unimaginable anger. In Paradise Lost, Milton gives the truth on which Virgil's shadowy type is based. The wrath of the Son, which cannot be properly described through words, becomes the archetypal original of Virgil's figure. The Virgiiian parallels grow as Milton continues. Aegaeon breathes fire as he clangs his swords and shields against Jove's thunder, while, in Paradise Lost, the Son throws ten thousand thunderbolts at his adversar- ies. The Chariot, with its four heads and sixteen faces, becomes even more closely a part of the Son: "One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye / Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire" (6.848-49). As the mul- tiple creatures of the Chariot merge with the Son to form a unit, Aeneas, though he is one person, similarly contains the strength and martial dex- terity of Aegaeon's many heads and limbs. The defeat of the demons is marked by the images of thunder, fire, and grotesque embodiments of rage found in Virgil's epic. Virgil's depiction of Aegaeon recalls various mythological accounts of another monster, Briareos. In fact, the similarities are so great that Philip R. Hardie has called Virgil's beast "Aegaeon- Briareos."13 In the Iliad, Homer says that Aegaeon is another name for Briareos, but unlike Virgil, he portrays the monster as a defender of Zeus. Achilles reminds his mother, Thetis, that she once prompted Aegaeon - whom the gods called Briareos - to thwart the attempt of Athena, Hera, and Poseidon to cast Zeus in chains: Ã XXÃ  ai) rov y'ÃªÃJOovca, OeÃ¢, bpeXvaao Ã´eGfiÅv, &amp;x Ã¨tcaTÃyxeipov KaXÃ©caa1 Ã¨Ã§ \iaKpbv uOko\uzov, Ã´v BpiÃ¢peÅv KaÃÃ©ovai deoi, Ã vÃ´peÃ§ Se re nÃ¢vreÃ§ AiyaiÅv * â¢ o yÃ p avxe pifl ov narpoÃ§ Ã¢^teivÅv.

Hesiod describes Briareos and his two brothers, Cottus and Gyes, as having 100 arms, 50 heads, and irresistible strength (150-53). Hesiod, like Homer, presents Briareos as one of Zeus' allies. In joining Zeus in the battle against the Titans, the hundred-handed brothers throw 300 rocks at the Titans, hurl their foes beneath the earth, and enchain them (715-18). But fragments of The Epic Cycle show that in the Titanomachy, ascribed both to Eumelus of Corinth and to Arctinus of Miletus, the union of Heaven and Earth pro- duces 3 cyclopes and 3 hundred-handed sons - presumably Briareos, Cottus, and Gyes; while Aegaeon is the son of Earth and Sea, and an ally of the Titans (frag. 1, frag. 3).14 Thus there was a mythological tradition that considered Briareos and Aegaeon to be two separate creatures, and that tradition holds that Aegaeon, unlike Briareos, was rebellious. In Paradise Lost, Milton identifies Satan with Briareos and thus indi- rectly with Aegaeon. The fallen angel lay prone on the burning lake of hell, as large as "Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove, / Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den / By ancient Tarsus held" (1.198-200). Just as Virgil's Aegaeon has been overlooked as a counterpart of the Son in Para- dise Lost 6, the figure from the Aeneid has likewise been disregarded as a source for Milton's Briareos. As in the War in Heaven, scholars have instead argued that Hesiod is Milton's principal classical authority. In his edition of Paradise Lost, Merritt Y. Hughes cites the Theogony as Milton's primary source and then notes that Milton may also have consulted Conti's Mythologiae 6.22 and Ovid's Metamorphoses 5.346-58. But Hughes says nothing about Aegaeon or the Virgilian context of the simile. Neither do Douglas Bush, Scott Elledge, Roy Flannagan, Stephen Orgel and Jonathan Goldberg, Christopher Ricks, or John T Shawcross in their editions. Alastair Fowler, in an edition that David Loewenstein credits for having "The most precise and extensive scholarly notes," follows Hughes by recognizing Hesiod, Ovid, and Conti as Milton's likely sources. While Fowler does not mention Virgil's Aegaeon, he observes that when Satan "Lay floating many a rood" (PL 1.196), Milton may be alluding to Virgil's description of the tortured Giant Tityos (Aen. 6.596). Thus Fowler detects some Virgilian material in the simile. Flannagan likewise observes</page><page sequence="11">VIRGIL'S AEGAEON AND PARADISE LOST 1 13 a Virgilian context for the passage. "Satan is a sea-serpent here," he writes in a gloss on 1.192, at the very beginning of the simile, "modeled after the sea-serpents in the Aeneid swimming toward Laocoon."15 Certainly the Leviathan simile brings to mind the battle described by Hesiod in the Theogony. Milton is fairly explicit about this when he mentions "Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove" (PL 1.198). Com- mentators have generally seen Milton's Briareos as part of this Hesiodic myth, for Hesiod includes Briareos in the Theogony, In his note on the passage, Hughes writes: "In the war of the Titans with the Olympian gods the hundred-armed Briareos is described by Hesiod (Theog. 713-16) as helping to defeat his brother Titans." But Hughes' interpretation is strained. Hesiod's Briareos fights for Zeus, while Milton's Satan fights against God. Hesiod's Briareos is among the victors, while Satan is among the vanquished. In betraying his brother Titans, Briareos more clearly resembles Abdiel "betraying" his fellow angels who wish to side with Sa- tan against God. And as we have seen, Homer had likewise presented Briareos as a defender of Jove in the Iliad (1.401-404). While Milton had direct knowledge of various classical texts relat- ing the battle of Zeus and the Titans, he also knew the myth as it had been adapted and retold in assorted Renaissance works, including Anto- nio Alfano's La battaglia celeste tra MichÃ¨le e Lncifero (1568), Gasparo Murtola's Delia creatione del mondo (1608), Alonso de Acevedo's Del creacion del mundo (1615), and Joost van den Vondel's Lucifer (1654). For some of these authors, it was natural to view Zeus as a model for God and to cast the Titans as rebellious angels. In his L Angeleida (1590), Erasmo di Valvasone even presents Satan as a hundred-handed monster, adding that he will relate the true story of the battle between Zeus and Briareos that Hesiod had previously ignored (1.6).16 Milton's image of the rebel- lious Briareos may have been partly shaped by Valvasone, for he was prob- ably familiar with the Italian author's work.17 But by far the most influential story of Briareos fighting against the gods is Virgil's account in Aeneid 10. Virgil's commentators have found the comparison of Aeneas to Aegaeon puzzling, in that pius Aeneas is likened to perfidious Aegaeon. W. S. Anderson reads the simile as an indication that the excessively violent Aeneas has now exceeded his limits; R. D. Williams notes that Aeneas, in an enraged frenzy, is compared to a monster symbolic of un- bridled brutality; Susan Ford Wiltshire repeats Williams' opinion that Aeneas is as unrestrained as Turnus or any Greek hero; M. Owen Lee says that Aeneas flouts the familial values which he had previously upheld,</page><page sequence="12">1 14 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES and that he engages in fighting "for the sheer lust of it"; and Murrin observes that while Aeneas tries to master his rage in Aeneid 12, he ends up killing indiscriminately.18 Such comments show how the simile may be interpreted as a criticism of passion extending beyond the bounds of reason, of vengeance and bloodlust transcending a soldier's discipline, and of the pursuit of individual glory undermining the social order that separates humans from animals even on the battlefield. Milton could have viewed VirgiPs Aegaeon in the same manner as these critics and thus as an appropriate figure for Satan. Virgil's Aegaeon matches Satan's pride and ambition in fighting against Zeus, and like Satan, he fights on the losing side of the war. In light of the Iliad, Milton had ample precedent to use "Briareos" as a synonym for "Aegaeon." Moreover, he had the ex- ample of Valvasone to give him additional reason for casting Briareos as an enemy of the Olympian gods. By calling the monster "Briareos" rather than "Aegaeon," he could sustain his larger parallel with the Theogony, while still calling upon other versions of the myth of rebellion. Virgil's comparison of Aeneas to Aegaeon (and thus to Briareos) links Aeneas to the classical hell and to Turnus. In the Aeneid, Briareos is grouped with several other monsters in Virgil's underworld, including the Hydra and the Chimaera: "centumgeminus Briareus ac belua Lernae, / horrendum stridens, flammisque armata Chimaera" ["the hundredfold Briareus, and the beast of Lerna, hissing horribly, and the Chimaera armed with flame"] (6.287-88). Just as Aegaeon has fifty mouths (10.566), Virgil's Hydra has "quinquaginta atris immanis hiatibus" ["fifty black gap- ing throats"] (6.576). So too, Aegaeon "quinquaginta oribus ignem / pectoribusque arsisse" ["flashed fire from fifty mouths and breasts"] (10.566-67) when he fought against Jove, and his fire-breathing aligns him with the Chimaera. Briareos also shares the underworld with Salmoneus, who likewise imitated Jove's thunder and heavenly fire, until the god struck him with a bolt of lightning (Aen. 6.585-94). The Chi- maera is depicted on Turnus' helmet (Aen. 7.785-86), and so Turnus is associated with hell and with Briareos. By becoming like Aegaeon- Briareos, Aeneas acquires some qualities of the Chimaera, and the figure of the Chimaera on Turnus' helmet underscores how much impius Aeneas resembles Turnus. The various inhabitants of Virgil's underworld are recalled in Para- dise Lost, and these references show a link between Satan, Briareos, and Aegaeon. Virgil's fallen Salmoneus resembles Milton's description of Sa- tan some 150 lines before the "Leviathan" simile:</page><page sequence="13">VIRGIL'S AEG AEON AND PARADISE LOST 1 1 5 Him the Almighty Power Hurl'd headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Sky With hideous ruin and combustion down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to Arms. (PL 1.44-49) And Milton explains in Book 6 that the Son, like Jove slaying Salmoneus, fought his foes with "ten thousand Thunders" (6.836). Moreover, Virgil's Hydra and Chimaera have serpentine features. Some 130 lines before saying that the Chimaera is pictured on Turnus' helmet, Virgil writes that Aventinus, the son of Hercules, "clipeoque insigne paternum / centum anguis cinctamque gerit serpentibus Hydram" ["on his shield bears his father's device - a hundred snakes and the Hydra, girt with serpents"] (Aen. 7.657-58). In the Metamorphoses, Ovid similarly describes the beast of Lerna as "ramosam natis e caede colubris / crescentemque malo" ["branching out with serpents sprung from death and thriving on destruc- tion"] (9.73-74). 19 So too, the Chimaera has a serpent's tail (9.648); and in the Theogony, the Chimaera has as one of its three heads the head of a snake or fierce dragon (322). The serpentine imagery of the Hydra and Chimaera with which Aegaeon is associated recalls both the image of Satan as a snake in the Garden of Eden (PL 9.494-95) and the descrip- tion of the devil and his demons transformed into serpents among ashen fruit (PL 10.504-77). Because Satan's form is serpentine as he lies on the burning lake, the links between Milton's Briareos and the snakes of clas- sical myth are particularly appropriate. Milton's implied comparison of the Son to Virgil's Aegaeon in Para- dise Lost 6 and his explicit comparison of Satan to Briareos in Paradise Lost 1 parallel the structure of the relationship among Aeneas, Aegaeon- Briareos, and Turnus in the Aeneid. Both the Son and Satan are like Aeneas, for Aeneas and the Son fight with the ferocity of Aegaeon, while Satan and Aeneas are as impius as Aegaeon- Briareos was in battling Jove. So too, Aeneas, Turnus, and Satan are linked to hell through the impietas of Aegaeon- Briareos. But because the Son stays loyal to God, he remains virtuous while Turnus, Satan, and Aeneas do not. Milton's image of the wrathful son riding the grotesque Chariot of Paternal Deity shows that the Son is more genuinely heroic than Aeneas, who fell from pietas on the battlefield while the Son remains pins. This similarity has gone unre- corded by Milton's editors, but Milton's veiled allusion to Aegaeon is</page><page sequence="14">1 1 6 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES significant, for it joins Paradise Lost 6 to Aeneid 10 and is part of the conflict between classical and Christian heroism that permeates Milton's poem. The presence of Virgil in Milton's treatment of the Son's heroic metamorphosis is a reminder of the overall importance of the Aeneid to Paradise Lost and suggests that the Aeneid, like the Iliad and the Theogony, is central to Milton's account of the War in Heaven. By drawing on the figure of Aegaeon- Briareos to describe both Christ and Satan, Milton invites the reader to compare and contrast the rebel angel and the dutiful Son of God. The critical image of Aeneid 10 is the figure of Aegaeon, for Aeneas' metaphoric transformation into the mon- ster marks the turning point of the war between the Trojans and the Rutulians. The figure of Aegaeon is thus also an appropriate sign of the turning point of the War in Heaven. In imitation of the Aeneid, the con- trolling image of Paradise Lost 6 is the figure of the Son riding the Chariot of Paternal Deity - Milton's reworking of Virgil's Aegaeon. Earlier in Book 6, Milton describes Satan in similar terms: High in the midst exalted as a God TV Apostate in his Sun-bright Chariot sat Idol of Majesty Divine, enclos'd With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields. (PL 6.99-102) Satan is exalted as if he were a god, while the Son is truly a deity. And Satan's chariot is only a parody of "Majesty Divine," while the Son's is the genuine emblem of divine majesty. Satan is likewise a counterfeit hero, while the Son is truly heroic. The common feature of the false hero- ism of Satan and the true heroism of the Son is their martial prowess, and the figure of Aegaeon serves to describe their fierceness in battle. In the case of Aeneas, the comparison to Aegaeon underscores both the hero's valor and his apparent transgression of pietas. When Aeneas fights like Aegaeon, he is still very human: he combines elements of virtue and vice. When Milton compares Satan to Briareos and thus to Aegaeon, however, he depicts violence stripped of virtue. As a type of Aegaeon and Aeneas, Satan embodies those features of classical heroism most con- flicting with Christianity. But when Milton compares the Son to Aegaeon, he presents violence stripped of vice and tempered by virtue. Unlike Sa- tan, who resorts to warfare to further his own ambition, the Son uses force to promote a just cause, the will of his heavenly Father. The Son, then, as a type of Aeneas and Aegaeon, embodies those elements of clas-</page><page sequence="15">VIRGIL'S AEGAEON AND PARADISE LOST 1 1 7 sical heroism most consistent with Christianity. He fights like the virtu- ous Briareos of Homer and Hesiod, who seeks to protect the interests of Zeus, while Satan fights like the overreaching Aegaeon of the Aeneid (and its Renaissance commentators), who seeks to overthrow Jove. In its ambiguity and range of meanings, the figure of Aegaeon was an attrac- tive vehicle for Milton to contrast Satan and the Son, to link Paradise Lost with the classical epic tradition, to mark the turning point of the War in Heaven, and to comment on the sometimes overlapping but of- ten conflicting notions of classical and Christian heroism.

While Porter says that the martial aspects of Milton's War in Heaven particularly recall the Iliad, the bulk of his discussion in Chapter 2 focuses on Hesiod's Theogony as Milton's principal source for allusions in Book 6 of Paradise Lost. "No other single work," says Porter, "is alluded to in Paradise Lost 6 so extensively or to such purpose as the Theogony" (54). 4.

John Peter Rumrich, Matter of Glory: A New Preface to "Paradise Lost" (Pittsburgh: U of Pittsburgh P, 1987), devotes an entire book to the subject, including an examination of glory in the Old Testament and in Homeric epic, and how Milton revised the Homeric concept of glory to fit his Christian framework. Blessington similarly argues that "The Son emerges from the battle in heaven as the archetype of the classical warrior, just as Satan was his distortion," and that the Son "is the true Achilles" in whom "The wrath of Achilles has become the wrath of God" (38-39). 6.
