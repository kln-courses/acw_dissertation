<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW In similar fashion, courts have variably interpreted the very notion of "officer" of the company,23 before taking the next step, which is to put aside the need for an alter ego in favour of granting rights, or imposing liability, via the modern route of agency and vicarious responsibility.24 The judgment in Stanfield Properties adds to the authority for a flexible approach. What the company knows or should know will depend on the purpose of the necessary inquiry, not upon any anthropomorphic concept of what a corporation "is." Indeed, Pro- fessor Hart's inaugural lecture surely administered to that question the coup de grace.5 But there are still problems. While the company may justly be required to answer in interrogatories for what its servants and former servants know, it would be absurd to draw the boundaries of its knowledge that wide for most other purposes. Legislation frequently assumes that a company has a certain "knowledge," "intention" or "purpose."26 Parliament should now confront the burgeoning uncer- tainties of the functional approach, and, free at last from the ghosts of Gierke and Dicey, turn its attention to the meaning of those concepts in order to make provision in designated areas of law27 for statutory guidelines or presumptions for future judicial inter- pretation. W. SEX DISCRIMINATION AND THE EUROPEAN COURT: CAN COMMUNITY LAW LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT? THE United Kingdom has once more been found to be in breach of its obligations under the EEC Treaty. In its recent judgment handed down in the enforcement action Commission v. United Kingdom,' the Court of Justice of the European Communities held that the United Kingdom had failed to enact provisions necessary to give effect to the EEC Directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working con- ditions ("Equal Treatment Directive").2 This case follows the con- 2 See Re A Company [1980] 1 All E.R. 284 (rev'sed on other grounds sub nom.

These will be dealt with in turn, although only the first raises real problems for English law and will accordingly be considered in greater detail. This involved the failure to enact measures giving full effect to the provisions of Articles 3 to 5 of the Directive which purport to ensure the implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women in all aspects of work. In particular, the Commission objected to the failure of the United Kingdom Government to introduce a measure providing that "any provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment which are included in collective agreements, indivi- dual contracts of employment, internal rules of undertakings or in rules governing the independent occupations and professions shall be, or may be declared, null and void or may be amended." The Government had failed to introduce such a measure in the belief that it would serve no useful purpose in law. Under section 18 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, any collective agreements entered into before December 1, 1971, or after the coming into force of that Act, are presumed not to be intended to be legally binding, in the absence of an express provision to the contrary. The Government claimed to be unaware of the existence of any legally enforceable collective agreements in the United Kingdom. Therefore, argued the United Kingdom, there is no need for the introduction of a specific provision covering this matter. In so far as collective agreements are legally binding or can be enforced through incorporation in individual contracts of employment, they are covered by section 77 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 which provides in effect that a discriminatory term in a contract is void. Alternatively, applying section 3 of the Equal Pay Act 1970, a collective agreement containing discriminatory terms can be referred to the Central Arbitration Committee for amendment. It should be noted, however, that such a remedy could never be sufficient for an individual victim of discrimination. Collective agreements can only be referred by parties to the agreement, under the terms of section 3, and moreover, the C.A.C. has no jurisdiction to amend indirectly discriminatory provisions.4 In support of its arguments the Govern- ment maintained that if any discriminatory collective agreement were put into practice, its use would be unlawful under the basic provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act prohibiting discrimination in employment on the grounds of sex or marital status to be found in section 6. These arguments apply equally to any discriminatory 3 Case 61/81 Commission v. United Kingdom [1982] E.C.R. 2601. 4 See R. v. C.A.C., ex p. Hy-Mac Ltd. [1979j I.R.L.R. 461 (D.C.). May 1984] 349 NOTES OF CASES</page><page sequence="3">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW clauses in the internal rules of undertakings as well as in the rules of the independent professions. These statutory provisions were insufficient to satisfy the Court. The fundamental premise behind the arguments of the Commission, which were accepted by the Court, related to the requirements of legal clarity and security. This approach was endorsed by the Advocate General. She pointed to the line of Court authority in which it has been held that it is not sufficient for obligations under Community law to be implemented by administrative practice where the actual law remains in breach. In particular she referred to the recent case of Commission v. Italy,5 where the Court reiterated this principle; she and the Commission accordingly argued that a specific provision declaring unlawful all discriminatory clauses in collective agreements was needed in the interests of legal certainty. In support of these contentions, the Commission suggested that there is a fundamental distinction between a discriminatory provision which is not legally enforceable because of the nature of the legal effects created by the agreement in which it is included, and a provision which is deemed by statute not to exist. Only in the latter case would the individual be fully protected. It should be noted, however, that in English law the essential problem about a "gentleman's" agree- ment is that of remedies. A collective agreement is normally intended not to be legally enforceable: hoW then can a stranger to such an agreement, such as a female victim of indirect discrimination, come before the court and obtain a binding judgment to the effect that the discriminatory provision is null and void? It is submitted that by analogy with Eastham v. Newcastle United Football Club and others6 such a victim would be able to obtain a declaration to this effect. In Eastham it was held that a professional football player had a sufficient interest to challenge the retention and transfer system operated by the Football League and Football Association in concert with Football clubs as being in unlawful restraint of trade. Wilber- force J. said that "the court has jurisdiction to grant a declaratory judgment, not only against the employer who is in contractual relationship with the employee, but also against the association of employers whose rules or regulations place an unjustifiable restraint on his liberty of employment."7 No reference to this possible remedy was made in the enforcement proceedings. Similar difficulties, provoked by the nature of the legal effects produced by collective agreements in English law, are encountered in the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regu- lations.8 These are intended to implement the so-called Acquired Rights Directive9 introducing the principle of the automatic transfer Case 145/82; judgment delivered March 15, 1983. 6 [1963] 3 All E.R. 139. 7 Ibid. at p.157. 8 S.I. 1981 No. 1794. See generally Hepple, "The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations" (1982) 11 I.L.J. 29. 9 EEC Directive 77/187 O.J. L61/26 of March 5, 1977. 350 [Vol. 47</page><page sequence="4">of contracts of employment, collective agreements and trade union recognition under certain circumstances where a business has been transferred. Regulation 6 accordingly provides that a collective agreement is to continue in force after the transfer and is to apply to the employees as if it had been concluded with the transferee. As those terms in a collective agreement which have been incorporated into individual contracts of employment are protected independently elsewhere in the Regulations, this provision appears to apply only to extra-contractual terms of the same nature as those which might cause problems in the context of sex discrimination. Since, however, it is expressly stated that this regulation is without prejudice to section 18 of the T.U.L.R.A. 1974 there does seem to be little chance of some sort of limited enforceability applying in this context. Article 3(2) of the Directive which purports to confer on workers the right to rely, as against their new employer, on the terms of their old collective agreements, in common with the analogous provisions in the Equal Treatment Directive, appears to be aimed primarily at Continental legal systems where collective agreements are commonly treated as contracts. However, there seems to be no objection in principle to an employee obtaining a declaration against his new employer to the effect that the latter is bound by the collective agreements concluded with the transferor, relying on the Regulations as interpreted in the light of the clear words of the Directive.10 Despite the persuasive force of Eastham's case, it remains an open question whether the courts would follow a similar approach in a case of direct or indirect sex discrimination in a collective agreement. There may be grounds for distinguishing this case which was based on the common law rules on restraint of trade. Eastham was contractually bound to Newcastle United by reference to the rules and regulations which he sought to challenge; it may be, therefore, that the analogy is valid only in so far as the collective agreement has been incorporated into the victim's contract of employment. This would obviously considerably reduce the value of this remedy since in the case of incorporation the terms of the agreement will in any case be subject to attack under section 77. Uncertainty as to whether a particular term is or is not deemed to be incorporated into an individual contract of employment would likewise do nothing to alleviate the difficulties faced by a victim of sex discrimination who is seeking an effective remedy. Nagle v. Feilden" may, it is submitted, offer some guidance. In that case a lady trainer successfully challenged an unwritten rule of the Jockey Club to refuse licences to women trainers; this clearly goes beyond the case where the victim is in fact contractually bound by reference to the terms which are being challenged. This case has 10 One should set against this the discouraging remarks of the Minister responsible for the Regulations who stated in the Commons that the transferee could "at once repudiate" agreements he does not like.

May 1984] 351 NOTES OF CASES</page><page sequence="5">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW been criticised as being bad law because the Court of Appeal was charging "into sectors hitherto private on the horse of public policy."12 Since the lady suffered no quantifiable damage she had no cause of action in tort; the Jockey Club could not have committed a wrong in refusing to contract with her. However, the Court of Appeal rightly believed that conduct such as the wilful exclusion of women is sufficiently contrary to public policy to justify the award of a declaration. Such an attitude may have been far-sighted in the 1960s, but in the 1980s should surely be the norm in view of our protective legislation. The de facto consequences of a discriminatory clause in a collective agreement must therefore be sufficient to allow a victim successfully to bring an action for a declaration of nullity. The possibility of obtaining a declaratory judgment along these lines under the existing law will not, however, have to be considered after the United Kingdom has implemented the Court's judgment to the effect that a specific statutory provision is needed invalidating discriminatory terms in all collective agreements regardless of the legal effects they do or do not produce. According to Paragraph 11 of the judgment "the reason for this generality lies in the fact that, even if they are not legally binding between the parties who sign them or with regard to the employment relationships which they govern, collective agreements nevertheless have important de facto consequences for the employmenft relationships to which they refer, particularly in so far as they determine the rights of the workers and, in the interests of industrial harmony, give undertakings some indication of the conditions which employment relationships must satisfy or need not satisfy." It is clear that the Court is coming very close to what is termed the "psychological effect" of legal provisions and terms which are in breach of Community law; this idea was discussed in Miller Inter- national Schallplatten v. Commission'3 where it was held that the mere existence in a contract of a term forbidding customers from exporting the applicant's records, even though it was not actually enforced, was sufficient for there to be a breach of the competition rules. This was because of its psychological effect which tended to lead to the splitting up of markets. This idea has also been of influence in the development of the fundamental freedoms of the Community.14 The second violation alleged by the Commission related to the scope of permissible exceptions to the principle of equal treatment allowed under the Directive. Article 2(2) of the Directive reads as follows: "This directive shall be without prejudice to the rights of Member States to exclude from its field of application those occu- 12 J. A.

France (French Merchant Seamen Case) [1974] E.C.R. 359; here a statutory provision forbidding the access of non-nationals to the Merchant Navy was held to be in breach of Community law although by administrative practice it was not applied. 352 [Vol. 47</page><page sequence="6">May 1984] NOTES OF CASES 353 pational activities and, where appropriate, the training leading thereto, for which, by reason of their nature or the context in which they are carried out, the sex of the worker constitutes a determining factor." The Court followed the Commission in holding that the exceptions to the principle of equal treatment laid down in section 6(3) of the Sex Discrimination Act covering employment for the purposes of a private household and in an undertaking employing five persons or fewer went beyond the scope of Article 2(2). The Court rejected the contention of the British Government that both of these exceptions could be justified on the basis of the close personal relationship between the employer and his employees. In the case of private households, it reduced the arguments to a consideration of the need to reconcile the principle of equal treat- ment with the principle of respect for private life. The Court may, however, have left itself open to misinterpretation because it held that (paragraph 14): "whilst it is undeniable that, for certain kinds of employment in a private household, that consideration may be decisive, that is not the case for all the kinds of employment in question." It is submitted that the concept of a "private household" is sufficiently well-defined in English law to exclude all but a very few occupational activities; it seems unfortunate that the Govern- ment will have to legislate to introduce an exception drafted in vague terms which may in fact assure less protection for the principle of equal treatment since it would be more open to abuse in the name of the principle of respect for private life. It emerges from the case that the Commission was seeking to encourage the Court to offer some guidance about the implemen- tation of directives. According to the Commission, the Member States have no discretion when laying down the exception to the principle of equal treatment and must follow the pattern of the Directive by making provision for a general exception to be inter- preted by the courts. Apparently legislative interpretation is not to be allowed, or least carries the risk of inviting an enforcement action if the Commission disagrees with the interpretation. Of course, a court which interpreted the exception in a manner incompatible with the case law of the European Court would likewise be in breach of Community law. The Court, however, failed to take the opportunity to consider these questions when dismissing the British submissions with very cursory reasoning. In the case of small undertakings it simply held that the United Kingdom had put forward no argument to support its contention that the sex of the worker may be a determining factor by reason of the nature of the activities or the context in which they are carried out. It is in any case questionable whether the sort of approach advocated by the Commission would not trespass on the sphere of authority left to Member States in relation to Directives, that of the choice of form and methods. One should also question whether the drafting of an exception in the terms suggested by the Directive</page><page sequence="7">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW would make any difference to the case which appeared to cause particular concern to the British Government, that of the elderly female owner or manageress of a small shop who wished to employ other women. Even if such a case were not to fall within the ambit of a general exception in the terms of Article 2(2) of the Directive, it may nevertheless be covered by other exceptions provided for in the Sex Discrimination Act including those relating to decency15 and residence'6 which are legitimated by Article 2(3) of the Directive; this provision excludes measures taken for the protection of women from the ambit of the principle of equal treatment. The final violation alleged concerned the partial ban operated by the United Kingdom at that time on men training and practising as midwives.17 The Court held that this partial ban did not exceed the residual powers left to Member States under Articles 2(2) and 9(2) of the Directive. The latter provides that Member States "shall periodically assess the occupational activities referred to in Article 2(2) in order to decide, in the light of social developments, whether there is justification for maintaining the exclusions concerned." Accordingly the United Kingdom announced plans during the pro- ceedings, which were subsequently put into action,18 to relax the restrictions on men whilst maintaining adequate safeguards for those women who objected to being treated by a male midwife. This was a sensible decision on the part of the Court which clearly recognised the need for social awareness and flexibility to be combined with the need to protect certain vulnerable classes of women, particularly of ethnic minorities, whilst maintaining progress towards true equality of opportunity. It will be seen that this case has raised several points of importance for both Community law and English law: for instance, how far should anti-discrimination law trespass into the domain of private life, and should this be decided by Parliament, the courts or even the EEC Institutions? It places considerable weight on the notions of legal clarity and psychological effect, notions upon which Com- munity law relies heavily in order to achieve full recognition within national legal orders. It is clear from decisions such as the French Merchant Seamen Case,19 that Community law requires the express enactment of Community rights and obligations by way of national legislative measures. This case pursues the same objectives, although, as we have seen, the road towards effective implementa- tion in the United Kingdom is paved with obstacles. Nevertheless, assuming the availability of a declaratory remedy, it may be that this 15 s.7(2)(b). 16 s.7(2)(c) as interpreted in Sisley v. Britannia Security Systems Ltd.

JOSEPHINE SHAW* DECONSTRUCTION: INTERPRETING THE REGULATION OF BUILDING OPERATIONS SOME of the thorniest problems of judicial construction are presented by legal provisions in which the wording suggests that the facts before the court were not of a kind anticipated by the legislators or their draftsmen. Kealey v. Heard' is illustrative of the consequences of the contrast between the somewhat rigid qualities of the available techniques of statutory interpretation and the more flexible response comprehended by the common law's approach to new and developing factual situations. The difficulties raised by the entry of the layman into territory which is traditionally the preserve of those working professionally are relatively familiar to the principles of common law negligence, but almost unknown to the framework of regulations which governs health and safety at the workplace. The defendant in Kealey v. Heard was rehabilitating a pair of semi-derelict houses with a view to conversion into flat-units. He employed a number of tradesmen to perform specific aspects of the necessary work. One of these, the plaintiff, suffered injury when a scaffold board erected by a scaf- folding contractor gave way. The latter could not be discovered, so the plaintiff pursued his remedy against the building owner. The provisions for interpretation by Mann J. were regulations 2 and 3(1) of the Construction (Working Places) Regulations 1966,2 which place certain duties on "every contractor, and every employer of workmen" who "undertake" "building operations .. ." Breaches of a number of the Regulations were admitted by the defendant should he be found to owe the requisite duty. The case against him was also framed in negligence. The defendant was not an "employer of workmen," as all those he employed were independent contrac- tors. Was he then a "contractor"? Yes, held the judge, but not one who was "undertaking" building operations. The judge considered the problem in this way: "It may at once be observed that the word 'contractor' is not in fact prefaced by the word 'building.' Taking the word 'contractor' alone and applying to it its ordinary meaning, the defendant was a contractor; he had contracts with his tradesmen."3 In explaining his decision Mann J. said that he saw "no reason to avoid the ordinary meaning of the word" "contractor," and appar- * Research Assistant in European Law, University College London.
