<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paideuma22, 1976 ROCK ENGRAVINGS FROM THE HAMASEN REGION, ERITREA PAVEL 6ERVl'6EK In the winter 1914/1915 and the spring 1915, Leo Frobenius, accompanied by A. Martius, R. Turstig, H. Kistenfeger and Mario Passarge, recorded 36 rock engravings pecked in a particular style in the Hamas6n region west of Asmara, Eritrea1. The recordings are Indian ink drawings. There are also a few photos, hardly reproducible any more, and some notes on the location, size, technique and patina of the engravings which are given in the following catalogue. The findings, hitherto unpublished, are in the possession of the Frobenius Institute at the University of Frankfurt-on-the-Main2. I.

All rock engravings recorded by Frobenius are characterized by a specific, highly conventionalized style; their predominant motif are bovine and ovine bucrania, their technique a rather crude pecking (figs. 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9-18, 20-28, 30-33, 35). Another motif are conventionalized animals: bovids (figs. 8, 32, 34, 36), camels (figs. 2 and 29) and one feline (? fig. 19); a third motif is a technical, grating-like figure (fig. 6). In fig. 17 middle, a conventionalized man imitating by his arms bovine horns is probably represented, as shown by analogous rock engravings in Armenia3. The specific, highly conventionalized style of the rock art discussed here has been called "comb style" because of the comb-like appearance of zoomorphs represented in it4. This style is not uncommon in Ethiopian rock art; it occurs - apart from our four Hamasfen stations Kortamit, Maji Malebess, Lamdrara and Dembe Wadi Mudui - at Ad Teclesan north of Asmara5, Amba Focada6, Ba'atti Abba Keisi7, Decanamo8, Toconda and Cohaito9 in Eritrea, at Laga Oda10, "Poro-Epic"11, Saka Sharifa, Errer Kimiet and Bake Khallo12 in the Hararge province, at Gazien in the Enderta13 and in Somalia at Bur Dahir, El Goran and Bur Eibe14. At the last-named site, a conventionalized cattle motif of this type represents the last (most recent) stage of the "Ethiopian-Arabian" style of cattle representations15. Further it is found in the Hijaz at Hanakiya16 and in Soviet Armenia it abounds at Oughtasar17 and occurs at Djermadour18. It is also known in Southern Africa19 and among the recent rock paintings at Songo near Bandiagara in Mali20. The "comb style" is frequent in the rock art of the Western Sahara21, the High22 and 3 Rock art station Oughtasar, see Karakhanian - Safian: 1970, pls. 186/1, 297, 304 and 307/1,2.

It also occurs in the IVth (Early Historic) Phase of the Indian rock art27. It is not very difficult to establish a chronology of this style as it reaches into the historic periods in many areas of its occurence. Thus bovids in this style have been engraved secondarily in the wall of the Wadi Mia rock temple of Sethos I28, in the walls of the Augustus' pronaos in the temple of Kalabsha29 and in those of the Traian's kiosk at Philae30. Most recent analogous conventionalized bovids are probably those found among the Christian Nubian graffiti of Faras31, most ancient those painted on the wooden female statuettes from Egyptian graves between the 12th and 18th dynasties32. In Nubia, representations in this style seem to habe been most frequent in the Meroitic and X-Group periods when we find them even on textiles33 - in the same time they occur in Egypt as magic signs34, on the Byzan- tine sealings35 and as signs placed beside the names of Blemmyan chiefs or kings on documents36. They recur as pagan symbols in Judaism of that period37. In Ethiopia, bronze objects in the shape of the conventionalized bovine bucrania known from the Hamasfen rock art have been discovered in the temple at Yeha, founded in the 6th century B. C.38. They probably recur on the Aksumite identity metal marks of Yeha as those signs which cannot be statisfactorily explained as Sabaean letters39. As to the grating-like motif from Kortamit (fig. 6), it has also been reported from the surroundings of the Dakhla oasis and from the vicinity of Taifa in Lower Nubia where it could be dated to the 4th century A. D.40. It recurs on rock engravings in Armenia41. 23 Frobenius - Obermaier: op. dr., pls. 4 (Tartania South), 19 (Bardi Valley), 30 (Valley near Tarit), 59 (Dermel Valley) et al. 24 Cerviiek: 1974, p. 136, figs. 138 right (El-Hagandia), 427 (Scharab) - on p.' 196 interpreted as "combined anchors", 502 (Chor el-Usina in the Wadi Abu Subeira) et al. 25 Monneret de Villard: 1935, p. 30, fig. 17 (Ger Belat); Dunbar: 1941, pl. 23/1 13; Hells from: 1970, Corpus C 460, X 4, 5, 41, 74, 77; Verner: 1975, pp. 64-65, 79, 82-83,86, cat. nos. 31, 185 (two combined bucrania interpreted as swastika, an ovine bucranium as the letter € etc.), 384, 417, 616etal. 26 Cervicek: op. cit, figs. 1, 2, 4-6 (Abrak) - interpreted as "anchors" (p. 196). 27 Wakankar: 1963, p. 137, figs. 3, 4. 28 Schott: 1961, pl. 15. 29 Maspero: 1909, pl. 28. 30 Knetsch: 1960, fig. 6. 3 1 Michatowski: 1967, pp. 37, 38. 32 Keimer: 1948, p. 25 ff., fig. 27 (p. 30). 33 Pellicer - Llongueras: 1965, p. 181, fig. 34. 34 Hunt: 1932, pp. 234-235. 35 Petrie: 1925.x&gt;\. 48/69. 36 Krall: 1900. v. 7, pl.

Nowadays, it still survives in mural paintings and carvings of several Ethiopian chruches as a characteristic Ethiopian ornament45 but sometimes the art influence is said to have come from Nubia some centuries before Christ46. Even though the origin of both the conventionalized bovine and ovine bucrania and the grating-like pattern goes as far back as to the Northern Mesopotamian Halafian pottery of the late 5th millennium B. C.47, one can resume, taking into account the afore-said facts, that the most probable date of the Hamas6n rock engravings described above will be the first half of the first millennium A.
