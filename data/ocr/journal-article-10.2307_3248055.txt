<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDUARD ERKES: IDOLS IN PRE-BUDDHIST CHINA IT IS AN ALMOST GENERALLY ACCEPTED VIEW THAT THE RELIGION OF THE Chinese did not know pictorial representations of divine beings before Buddhism introduced iconography into China.! But this opinion will bear a close investigation just as little as the similar one which was only of late refuted through a closer acquaintance with old Chinese art, namely, that the ancient Chinese had not known figurative ar-t at all before they had met with that of India. On the con- trary, ancient Chinese literature as well as archaeological observations show clearly that the beginnings of iconography in China go back to a very early time and may even with a high probability be traced to prehistoric periods. That the ancient Chinese conceived their gods in human, or, what seems to go back to a still earlier period, in animal shape,2 may be gathered from the whole of old literature, where the divinities always appear in an entirely anthropomorphic fashion. Also the pictorial writing indicates the same notions, as the characters used for the designation of supernatural beings show human or animal forms.3 But the idols which were actually used in worship go back to a still earlier con- ception, as they do not represent those spiritual beings of human or animal shape Plath, Die Religion und der Cultus der alten Chinesen, (1868), pt. I, 15/16; pt.

Lieh-tze 2, 8b/ga (Wilhelm, Lia-dsi, p. 26) also says of the gods and heroes of ancient times: &lt;&lt;P'ao-hi and Ni-kua, Shen-nung and the Prince of Hia had a serpent's body and a human face, an ox-head and a tiger's snout; they had no human shape.&gt; 3 Animal forms of gods appear in characters as i li &lt;&lt;spectre&gt; (insect under a rock), 7 tsao &lt;hearth&gt; (toad in a cave), g ch'i &lt;&lt;mountain spirit&gt;&gt;, (compare t k'in, a big bird).

They must therefore go back to a period which had not yet separated the conception of the spirit of a thing from that of the thing itself. All the divine beings which the ancient Chinese represented as idols are vegeta- tion gods. This fact leads to the conclusion that idols originated in China as well as otherwhere together with agriculture and sedentary life which slowly alienated man from nature with which he was no longer in close personal contact. Thus we first meet with an image of jade (Fig. 1) which is generally thought to represent a symbol of heaven; but really it is no symbol, but a true effigy, the image of the sun, the concrete deity from which the conception of the divine heaven was only developed later.4 The nephrite idol corresponds exactly to the oldest forms of the character designing the sun in Chinese writing.5 In the same manner, other types of the same idol, showing the rays of the sun, are found among the old characters. Thus the round slab is a true idol and no symbol; only a later time which had made such progress in art that it was no longer able to understand the pictorial character of the old image, conceived the sun- disk as a symbolical representation of the round heaven.7 In the same manner, also the so-called symbol of the earth-goddess (Fig. 2) is a real idol, representing the vagina of Mother Earth, as it was represented in the cult of the earth by a pit in which the victims offered to Earth were buried.8 The same conception is preserved in the second hexagram of the Yih-king, 1I k'un, earth, whose form = implies the same idea.9 Also the stars were reproduced as idols by a round disk from which a ray was protruding,? - the same design which is represented by the character $i poh "white," - and the image of the mountain- gods also seems to be connected with the old form of the character Ll shan "moun- * See Schindler, 1. c. p. 300-512. 5 See the characters given in Chuan-tze-wei, 9, 5b; Chung-ting-tze-yuan, 5, 4b; Loh Chen- yiih, Yin-hiu-wen-tze-lei-pien, 7, 1 a. 6 See the character from the Hua-yoh-p'ei _ H 4 in Chuan-tze-wei 9, b.

First there is the dragon who also to- day plays a conspicuous part in the religious conceptions of the Chinese. The dragon is originally the crocodile that sleeps during winter in the M SAS p 6 mud and reappears in spring, when the rainy season sets in. Therefore it was looked at as the bringer of rain and, of course, held in high esteem. Sometimes it is reproduced in a highly naturalistic manner, as on the oracle bones dating from the earlier(?) Chou period which have been published by Hopkins."2 The jade-images of dragons were generally of a more ornamental character, but their origin is never- FIG. 2. IMAGE OF THE EARTH-GODDESS.

This beast was also revered as a vegetative deity, because it hunted down the wild boars which did damage to the fields.'4 The image of the tiger had already in the Chou time assumed a highly conventional form which shows it to look back upon an old tradition.15 These pictorial representations of animal-gods lead us to those of gods conceived under an anthropomorphic form. The human form appears in iconography of " Chavannes in Journal Asiatique 19 01, p. 196; Erkes, Das Weltbild des Huai-nan-tze, OZ 5 (1917), nOte 172; Schindler in Asia Major I (1924), p. 635. 12 Hopkins, Dragon and Alligator, JRAS 1913, P. 545 a. f. i Compare the dragon-images in Laufer, Jade, figs. 91, 92, 93, l15i d'Ardenne de Tizac, 1. c., pl.

Thus the ancestral tablet used in the mortuary cult was cer- tainly developed out of an old image. This may be gathered from its form which still to-day reminds of a human figure, and also from a ceremony still in vogue in the South, where the tablet is consecrated by putting on it four spots, represent- ing the eyes and ears, with red paint,16 this paint doubtlessly being a substitute for blood that was originally used. But also a number of literary proofs may be adduced for the use of human effigies in the ancestral cult, which, in their turn, may have been substitutes for the corpse of the deceased itself. That the corpse itself was originally revered, seems also to follow from the existence of a living representative of the deceased who was called the corpse, shi P, and who had to personate the former during the sacrifice by behaving like a dead body."7 Several passages in ancient literature seem to show that the corpse of a dead leader and afterwards his wooden statue were conveyed into battle, to secure victory by means of their magical power. Thus we learn from K'iih Yuian's T'ien-wen that Wu-wang brought the shi of his father with him when fighting the decisive battle against the Yin dynasty.'8 According to the commentary of Chu Hi, he would have brought the body itself in its coffin, but the commentaries of Wang Yih and Hung Hing-tsu, as well as the Shi-ki, tell us that he merely had a wooden statue (i7 t muh-chu, lit. "wooden lord") on his carriage.19 Possibly the two diff- erent records preserve the traditions of two different customs, the latter of which must then, in all probability, have developed from the former. A passage in the Yih-king seems to point to the same custom and would then show it to have 16 Grube, Religion und Kultus der Chinesen, p. 194. 17 in P &lt;&lt;to sit like a shi&gt;&gt; (Li-ki 1i, [Yu-tsao], 3, 28, Couvreur, Li-ki I, 721) means &lt;to keep immovable&gt;&gt;; P I J &lt;the advantage of a shi&gt;&gt; (Li-ki 29 [Piao-ki], 58, Couvreur, Li-ki II, 504) means &lt;to get food without work&gt;&gt;. 18 T'ien-wen 1. 162: i* P &lt;&lt;he conveyed the shi on his carriage&gt;&gt;. 19 Chu Hi says: iZ IE X IJ iK W&amp; &lt;&lt;he brought the coffined body of Wen-wang into the battle&gt; (the body in the coffin was called W, whereas P designed the body not yet coffined, Li-ki 1 [K'uh-li], 2, 3, 11, Couvreur, Li-ki I, 1o2; Li-ki 52 [Wen-sang], 2, Couvreur, Li-ki II, 555; also the coffin containing the body was called Ut). But Wang Yih asserts that only 3C E ?* &lt;&lt;the wooden statue of Wen-wang&gt; was put on the carriage, and Hung Hing-tsu, quoting the Shi-ki, maintains the same view. The Shi-ki (4, 2b, Chavannes, Mem. hist. I, 224) also says: A E 71 fFi * J1 i 4 i W &lt;&lt;(Wu-wang) made a wooden image of Wen-wang and con- veyed it by means of a carriage into the battle&gt;.

The Chou-li says, enumerating the duties of the Siao-tsung-poh: "When there is a great military ex- pedition, he orders the officials to prepare the army-altar and the carriage for the portable image ($4 z feng-chu, lit. "portable lord").21 It is possible, however, that this expression refers to the portable image of the land-god (see below, note 37), though the character t seems to point to an ancestral image. Also the commen- tary of the Wu-king-i-ngi says that is S shen-siang "images of the spirits" were carried into battle.22 In the Shu-king, a wen-tsu XC i "ornamented ancestor" is mentioned several times, probably a carved and painted ancestral statue which seems to have been of importance, as great ceremonies were performed before it. So it is recorded that Yao abdicated before the Wen-tsu in favour of Shun;23 Shun sacrifices a bull to the image24 and pays it a visit on New Year.25 As this wen-tsu is only mentioned in connection with Shun, it may have been a special divinity of the dynasty of this "Eastern barbarian" - as Shun is called by Meng- tzeIV, 2 Ii - whose religion seems to have been very different from that practised in China before and afterwards.2 In Sung Yiih's Chao-hun (3 d century B. C.) the soul of the deceased is informed that his statue (f1 siang, the character makes it sure tha-t a human-shaped image is meant) is standing in his house.2 Ancestral 20 Yih-king, Hex. 7 (Wilhelm, I-ging, I, 24/5; but I can neither agree with his translation nor with his explanations). 21 Chou-li 19, 18 (Biot 1, 449, where the passage is mistranslated). 22 Quoted by Schindler, Hirth Anniversary Volume, p. 520. 23 Shu II, i, 4. 24 Shu II, i, 8. 25 Shu II, 121 4. 26 See Schindler, Hirth Anniversary Volume, p. 547 a. f. - The indication of the Shi-ki that Wen-tsu was an ancestor of Yao, is evidently a mere invention, the impossibility of which has been conclusively demonstrated by Granet, Danses et legendes de la Chine ancienne, p. 278, note 4. The current explanation that Wen-tsu was the name of an ancestral temple, is also very improbable (see Chavannes, Mdm. hist. I, 56, note 4); if it is true, it can only be a secondary application of the designation, as i1 means a personal being and not a place. 27 Chao-bun 1. 49; (see Erkes, Das Zuriuckrufen der Seele [Chao-hun] des SungYiih [1 914], p. 24/5): f t &lt; &lt; ?The image is placed in your house&gt;&gt;. The commentary of Chu Hi remarks: 9</page><page sequence="7">statues of stone are also mentioned during the Han time.28 Nevertheless, the use of human-shaped idols in the ancestral cult was no longer deemed proper during the Han time; but to make a compromise between the old usage and the new ideas, the ancestral tablets were still called t chu "lords," but no longer fashioned in human shape.29 But at least in some regions of China, the custom of represent- ing the ancestors by statues must have been upheld much longer. The Museum of Ethnology at Leipzig possesses a marble image in the shape of an ancestral tablet, dated from the time of the Wei (A. D. 532), upon which the ancestor is figured in the outfit of a Buddha.30 Unfortunately, neither the genuineness nor the character of the image is undisputed.31 In the 14th century, the Italian traveller Giovanni da Cora speaks of statues used in the ancestral cult,32 and even as late as the 17 th century, the Dutchman Neuhof records the same custom from the province of Fuh-kien and gives an illustration showing an ancestral altar on which a statue takes the place of the tablet.33 fij f F. A X 10 IJ -t t J' It I1 ; fii A . &lt;&lt;As to the statue, generally it was a custom of Ch'u, that after a man's death they placed a likeness of him into the house and sacrificed to it.&gt;&gt; Wang Yih takes fI in the sense of i I &lt;&lt;after the model&gt;&gt; and explains: 75 A i- f : f )ii: ;i t ? &lt;&lt; Then they have built for you a house fitting your rank after the model of old buildings, where you may dwell.&gt;&gt; But this explanation makes no sense and is simply absurd, as has already been pointed out by Conrady in Munsterberg, Chinesische Kunstge- schichte, I, 79. 28 Two statues of this kind are figured in the Kin-shih-soh, Shih-soh. As these ancestral statues are made of stone, it is perhaps not impossible that also the Tii shih &lt;&lt;stone-spirits&gt;&gt; of antiquity (see e. g. Tso-chuan III, 15 5 XII, 16) were images and not, as generally assumed, mere tablets. 29 Lun-heng 25, 9b (Forke, The Lun-heng, I, 536): 7i i ;A T R , i o , t 7 ?r,M ; E1 1, i~ ~ t. &lt;According to the li, when one enters an ancestral temple, a 'lord' must not be there.

As to the lord, one serves it in spirit, (but) does not make it a human image.&gt; -From this passage it appears that the expression t in ancient literature designs a human- shaped image and not a mere tablet. 30 Erkes, Ahnenbilder und buddhistische Skulpturen aus Altchina, Jahrbuch des Stadtischen Museums fiur Volkerkunde in Leipzig, 5 (1913), 26-52. The image in question is re- produced on pl. 2, fig. 2; see also pl. i, fig. 2, 31 See Chavannes in T'oung-pao 15 (1914), 291/97, who thinks it a counterfeited image of Lao-tze. However, I wish to remark that the critic had not seen the image, whereas two authorities who had personally examined it, Professor Conrady and Mr. Ts'ai Yuian-p'ei, have both judged it as a genuine ancestral statue and confirmed my reading of the inscription. 32 Yule, Cathay and the Way thither, (2d ed.), III, 100. 33 Text und illustration are reproduced in Pelka, Ostasiatische Reisebilder im Kunstgewerbe des 18. Jahrhunderts (1924), p. 36 and pl. 44, fig. 16. 10</page><page sequence="8">Like the deified men, also the anthropomorphically conceived gods were represent- ed in human form. The ancient characters mentioned above (see note 3) which represent supernatural beings, may be looked at as forerunners, if not as beginn- nings, of the pictorial representations of such, and certainly show them to have been conceived and figured under human and animal forms. The same fact is shown by the oldest known description of Chinese temple-frescoes which the poet K'iih Yuan gives in his curious poem T'ien-wen X9 mP "Heavenly Questions" (about B. C. 300).34 Thus it would be strange if statues of the gods had not also been used in cultic worship, and we may really show this to have been the case. Where ideas belonging to the ancestral cult entered into the vegetation cults, they contributed to the humanising of the vegetation gods who had first been con- ceived in animal shape or merely under their natural forms. This was especially the case with the protective gods of a territory who were often identified with historical persons. The image used to represent such a territorial god had in all probability developed from the tree which originally represented the god,33 as the tree, respectively the pole which is its first substitute, seems generally to be the origin of the human-shaped idol.36 After a notice from B. C. 5o6,37 such an image was cared for by a special priest who in case of a military expedition had to follow his ruler with the statue into the field. Later on, the image was made of stone,38 but this mediaeval custom seems also to hold good for the old times. A commentary of the Chou-li states that under the Chou dynasty the images of the land-gods were made of stone,39 but Huai-nan-tze asserts that stone images were used as early as the Yin dynasty, whereas the Chou had returned to the earlier custom of using trees as land-gods.40 There are also some allusions to the use of statues in other forms of worship. 34 A sketch of this poem is given by Conrady in Munsterberg, Chinesische Kunstgeschichte, I, 80-8 5. Conrady has left a complete translation of the T'ien-wen, an edition of which is prepared by the present writer. 35 After the Lun-yii, III, Qi, fir-trees served this purpose under the Hia dynasty, whereas cypresses were used under the Yin and chestnut-trees under the Chou. But the custom seems to have varied in different regions; see Chavannes, Le T'ai-chan, 466-476. 36 Wundt, Mythus und Religion (1915), III, 329 a. f. 37 Tso-chuan XI, 4, 4. 38 See Chavannes, Le T'ai-chan, p. 477. 39 Chou-li 19, 18 (Biot I, 449). 40 Huai-nan-tze 1, lob. 11</page><page sequence="9">One is contained in the Ngi-li," where it is said that the six directions (heaven, earth and the four points of the compass) were represented by wooden statues painted with the symbolic colours of the respective quarter of the world. The commentary adds that the statues (AV siang) were "like the images of the ances- tral temples" (Ah , Ji ?? * i), so they were probably fully carved human effi- gies. Another hint is given in the Li-ki,42 where it is said in the description of the sacrifice to Kao-mei 4 it, the goddess43 of births and marriages, that a certain rite was performed "before Kao-mei" (1 A ;A il4). If we do not want to assume that the goddess was represented by a living woman-as female ancestors were in ancestral ceremonies 4+-we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the ceremony was performed before an image of Kao-mei. We may therefore take it for granted that China possessed an iconography long before the coming of Buddhism or the beginning of Indian influence. The Indian spirit only helped towards the full development of germs that had already existled, but gave nothing to China that she had not yet possessed herself.

Others combat this view and think Kao-mei to be a male divinity, identical with the emperor Kao-sin (Ti Kuh, see Tze-tien s. v. t1). But the divine functions of presiding over birth and marriage make it almost certain that Kao-mei was conceived as a female being 44 Ngi-li 14, 9 b (Couvreur, I-li, p. 535). 1 2</page></plain_text>
