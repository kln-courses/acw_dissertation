This recovery was represented as restoring the traditional Roman state, even though it also required a whole series of innovations. The latter, therefore, had to comply with what Aurelian's contemporaries understood to be 'traditional'. What follows will deal with two such instances, presenting them as reflections of the imperial image in the third century. AURELIAN'S POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL AMNESTIES Aurelian is said to have declared an 'amnesty for offences against the state'. Neither the Vita Aureliani nor Aurelius Victor explicitly date this amnesty. In Victor's text everything seems to occur after Aurelian's return to Rome from his eastern wars. The Vita includes the amnesty in a summary of several of the emperor's actions that are reported after Aurelian's death.' However, both texts are notoriously suspect on many details. For example, Aurelius Victor mentions Aurelian's amnesty as 'decreed in a Greek manner', whereas the Vita Aureliani says that it was decreed according to the example of the Athenians, with reference to Cicero's Philippics. Cicero spoke of the decree of the Senate in 44 B.C., which granted amnesty to all those implicated in the murder of Caesar.2 But, unlike Caesar, Claudius II Gothicus died a natural death, if a death from a disease can be counted as such.3 Additionally, Cicero spoke about the 'Greek word', not the 'Greek manner'. Interpretations of Aurelian's amnesty as 'decreed in a Greek manner' therefore fail for several reasons.4 Even more importantly, both texts are biographies presenting the material not so much chronologically as thematically and offering reflections on the emperor's personality by collecting the same sort of information from different parts of his ' Aur. Vict. 35.7: 'fiscal debts and charges of informers (deletaequefiscales et quadruplatorum), which had unsettled the city, were suppressed and their records were burnt, and an amnesty was decreed in a Greek manner (ad Graeciae morem decreta abolitione)'; HA Aurel. 39.4: amnestia etiam sub eo delictorum publicorum decreta est de exemplo Atheniensium, cuius rei etiam Tullius in Philippicis meminit. It is for this reason, it seems, that E. Groag, 'L. Domitius (36) Aurelianus', RE 5 (1905), 1396-7 dated both this amnesty and Aurelian's financial amnesty (see below) to 274. 2 Cic. Philipp. 1.1: Graecum etiam verbum usurpavi, quo tum in sedandis discordiis usa erat civitas illa, atque omnem memoriam discordiarum oblivione sempiterna delendam censui. 3 HA Claud. 12.2, Aurel. 37.5. 4 For this instance of the 'misuse' of Cicero's text, see A. Chastagnol, 'Dii immortales: traces de Ciceron dans les Vies des empereurs illyriens', in E. Frezouls and H. Jouffroy (edd.), Les empereurs illyriens. Actes du colloque de Strasbourg (11-13 octobre 1990) (Strasbourg, 1998), 30. This confusion may have been caused, at least in part, by the later misunderstanding of 'Greek undertones' in Cicero's speech; see esp. K. Sion-Jenkis, 'Griechisches Denken im r6mischen Gewand: Oberlegungen zu Ciceros Amnestie-Rede nach Caesars Ermordung bei Cassius Dio (44, 23-33)', in N. Ehrhardt and L.-M.

Political amnesties had been a traditional practice in Roman imperial history. Claudius I declared an amnesty after the senatorial opposition to his accession to the throne in A.D. 41 had been crushed.6 More recent precedents were also to hand. Caracalla declared an amnesty after he had his brother Geta murdered and made himself sole emperor.7 The reality was quite grim: supporters of Geta, real and alleged, were prosecuted and exiled. But the fact remains that the amnesty was meant to heal the rift in a society torn apart by factional struggles for supreme power. The amnesty of Macrinus, which accompanied his acclamation as new emperor and concerned those who had suffered from Caracalla, followed along the same lines.8 The need to declare a new amnesty shows, among other things, that the amnesty of Caracalla had been just words. Philip is also known to have declared a general amnesty, similar to the one that took place in the reign of Severus Alexander,9 thus signalling the return of the 'good old times'. All such amnesties marked the enthronement of new emperors and their desire, pretended or real, to reconcile warring factions inside the Roman 6lite. Since Claudius II died a natural death, Aurelian's amnesty may have been announced to consolidate the Roman political establishment after Aurelian seized imperial power from Quintillus, who inherited this power from his brother Claudius. Like many other 'losers' of the third century, Quintillus has remained a mysterious figure. Accounts differ as to the way he came to power, the time he remained on the throne, and the manner in which he lost the empire and his own life.10 The Vita Aureliani, which creates a very positive image of Aurelian, presents Quintillus as an usurper." But another viewpoint, which we see in the Vita Claudii, the Breviarium ab urbe condita of Eutropius, and several other texts, refers to Quintillus as an emperor elected due to his many virtues and with the help of the Senate.12 The rule of Quintillus probably lasted more than 'a few days', and probably more than 'seventeen days'-which is the period that ancient authors mention most frequently: Zosimus speaks of 'several months' and 5 For distinctions between such genres as history and biography, see e.g. R.

Reference to the Genius Populi Romani on the coin commemorating Divus Claudius has been interpreted as signalling the period when the Senate had greater power over the state.19 In the imperial period, Genio P(opuli) R(omani) first emerged on the obverse of coins in the time of the civil wars of 68-9, while their reverse carried legends that included Ob civis servatos, Pax, and SPQR.20 The coins from the early reign of Septimius Severus, when he still called himself Pertinax and therefore posed as the defender of the Roman state against 13 Zosim. 1.47 followed by H.

The circumstances in which Aurelian ascended to the throne made it necessary for him to present the establishment of his rule in forms that would seem traditional to the Romans, such as declaring a general amnesty. As a part of this policy, Aurelian held the consulate of 271 with Pomponius Bassus, who had been the princeps senatus under Claudius.23 But the rift in Roman society remained. The Senate was not satisfied with the amnesty that probably was such in name only. According to his Vita, Aurelian's defeat near Placentia by the barbarians invading Italy (winter 270-1) brought the friction between him and the Senate back to the surface in the form of a sedition at Rome.24 Aurelian retaliated with repressions that started after his war against the Marcomanni was over.25 Aurelian had also declared a financial amnesty by ordering the burning on the Forum of Trajan of public records of debts due to the state. The Vita and Aurelius Victor do not provide any explicit chronological indication of this amnesty.26 As could be expected, here, too, Aurelian was acting in a traditional manner. In 118, soon after his accession, Hadrian (117-38) remitted all debts and had debt charters burned publicly 'in the forum'.27 Marcus (161-80) likewise burned publicly all debt records 'in the forum' in 178. Cassius Dio says that Marcus 'remitted all debts owed by anyone to the emperor's private treasury or to the public treasury for a period of forty-five years, not including the fifteen years of Hadrian; and he ordered all the documents relating to these debts to be burned in the forum'.28 Dio's words reveal that Hadrian had introduced fifteen-year census cycles.29 Marcus 21 E.g.

The appearance of liberalitas on imperial coins in the reign of Hadrian was most probably connected with this financial amnesty. The earliest such coins refer to Hadrian as consul for the third time (RIC II, 355, 364-5, 414, 432), which dates them to 119: Kienast (n. 24), 129. 28 E.g. HA Marc. 23.3; Jerom.

Aurelian followed along the same lines. The date of Aurelian's financial amnesty could not correspond to Hadrian's cycles, but the resurrection of this practice obviously resulted from Aurelian's desire to smooth his takeover of imperial power against the resistance of the Senate. The Vitae of Hadrian and Aurelian explain the burning of the debt records as the desire of these emperors to increase the people's general sense of security. This parallelism also suggests that Aurelian declared his financial amnesty at the beginning of the reign. The insecurity could arise because of the political instability which accompanied his coming to power or the threat from the barbarians before Aurelian started to (re)build the walls of Rome in 271 (see below) or both. In the first months of his reign, Aurelian did not express any need for more money than he had. His letter to the Senate, in which Aurelian urged the senators to consult the Sibylline books, looking for a way of stopping the advance of the Marcomanni, ends with the following sentence: 'You have under your own control the money-chest of the state, which I find more full than were my desire'.30 Even if the letter as such is a forgery,31 the overall tone of this text fits well into the time of Aurelian's financial amnesty. However, just like his political amnesty, Aurelian's financial amnesty quickly proved to be a failure. After the Marcomannic war, Aurelian's repressions included confiscations which, as Ammianus Marcellinus tells us, were aimed against 'the rich', and were still remembered a century later. One could hardly expect a financial amnesty in such circumstances. According to Ammianus, the contemporaries of Valentinian I explained these confiscations as necessary due to the depletion of the treasury, because of the excesses of Gallienus. It is hard to say if this was an official excuse put forward by Aurelian.32 But 'the rich' most appropriately referred to Roman aristocracy, and especially the senators who wavered in the time of Aurelian's defeat at Placentia and were then punished by him. Examined together with similar amnesties from the past, those of Aurelian appear to have reflected his initial attempt to co-operate, at least nominally, with the Senate. But this proved not enough for the Roman political elite. The short period of a rapprochement between the Senate and Aurelian, who had attempted to base his rule on what then seemed traditional, was over. THE WALLS AND THE POMERIUM OF ROME Aurelian is said to have built, or rebuilt, walls around Rome.33 Two questions that emerge immediately are whether Aurelian extended the walls of Rome and whether he also extended the pomerium, that is, the sacred boundary of Rome.34 His Vita says the provision that this measure was to be repeated every fifteen years.

The pomerium, however, he did not extend at that time, but later. For no emperor may extend the pomerium save one who has added to the empire of Rome some portion of foreign territory. It was indeed extended by Augustus, by Trajan, and by Nero, under whom the districts of Pontus Polemoniacus and the Cottian Alps were brought under the sway of Rome.'35 On the one hand, the absence of Claudius and Vespasian with Titus in this passage of the Vita is suspect. Only these men have been documented both in literary texts and through epigraphical evidence as the emperors who extended the pomerium of Rome; and they also held censorship on those occasions.36 On the other hand, no other evidence exists which contains this sort of information about Nero and Trajan. Their presence in this part of the Vita Aureliani is, therefore, similarly suspect.37 It would be helpful to see what happened to the pomerium before the reign of Aurelian. The so-called lex de imperio Vespasiani authorized Vespasian to extend the pomerium of the city of Rome 'whenever he deems it to be in the interest of the state', as Claudius had done.38 Mommsen concluded that emperors had the same right as censors to extend the pomerium, offering two arguments. The first was that since the lex mentioned only Claudius, neither Augustus nor Tiberius had this right. Secondly, Mommsen argued that Claudius did not hold censorship in 49.39 But no such evidence exists about Tiberius at all, and it would be reasonable to suggest that he did not extend the pomerium. The absence of Augustus in this part of the lex indeed poses a problem. Augustus' enlargement of the pomerium has been referred to by both Tacitus and Cassius Dio.40 Augustus' Res Gestae, however, does not say anything about his extension of the pomerium. Seneca refers to Sulla as the person A. Simonelli, 'Considerazioni sull' origine, la natura e l'evoluzione del pomerium', Aevum 75 (2001), 160-2. A. W. Lintott, 'Pomerium', OCD3, 1213 thought of Aurelian's extension of the pomerium as doubtful; H. Galsterer, 'Pomerium', NPauly 10 (2001), 86-7 mentioned neither Nero nor Trajan nor Aurelian among those who extended the pomerium. 35 HA Aurel. 21.9-11: muros urbis Romae dilatavit. nec tamen pomerio addidit eo tempore sed postea. pomerio autem neminem principum licet addere nisi eum qui agri barbarici aliqua parte Romanam rem publicam locupletaverit. addidit autem Augustus, addidit Traianus, addidit Nero, sub quo Pontus Polemoniacus et Alpes Cottiae Romano nomini sunt tributae. 36 Claudius: Tac. Ann. 12.24; Gell. NA 13.14.4-7 (Claudius included the Aventine, the last remaining of the seven hills of Rome, in the enlarged pomerium); CIL VI, 1231 (= ILS 213), 31537a-d, 37023-37024.

Syme, 'The Pomerium in the Historia Augusta', in Bonner Historia- Augusta-Colloquium 1975/1976 (Bonn, 1978), 222-31. The circuit of the restored pomerium of Hadrian is thought to have been identical with that of Vespasian; see esp. Labrousse (n. 34), 167; cf. Andreussi (n. 34), 104.

The conclusion that Augustus did not enlarge the pomerium is probably too radical.42 This part of the lex most likely did not mention Augustus because, when Augustus extended the pomerium, his status was different from that of Claudius in the same situation. Augustus is thought to have enlarged the pomerium in 8 B.C.43 The census took place in the same year,44 but Augustus only says the following: 'Then a second time, acting alone, by virtue of the consular power, I completed the taking of the census in the consulship of Gaius Censorinus and Gaius Asinius'.45 Augustus was acting proconsule: according to Cassius Dio, Augustus obtained the imperium proconsulare for another period of ten years in 8 B.C.46 He therefore did not have censorship in 8 B.C., and if he enlarged the pomerium in that year, he did so by virtue of his imperium. Mommsen's theory can therefore be questioned: although imperatores also had the right to extend the pomerium, they did not have the same right as censors. For this reason, the lex de imperio Vespasiani does not refer to Augustus as the one who extended the pomerium, thus implying that Vespasian should assume the censorship if he wished to extend the pomerium. There is no indication that Aurelian ever held the censorship or conducted a census.47 Further observations likewise raise suspicions regarding the information provided by the Vita Aureliani. First, this text was correct when it said that the pomerium could be enlarged only by someone who increased the territory of the Roman state.48 However, Aurelian did not add foreign territory to the Roman state, but only restored what had been in the hands of insurgents.49 He even abandoned some parts of Roman territory, such as Dacia to the north of the Danube.50 The association 41 Sen.

Secondly, if the circuit of the Aurelian walls was about twelve miles, as some have argued," then these walls went along the old boundary of the city, as it was established by Vespasian, and were restored in the late second and early third centuries.52 The 'new walls' of Aurelian could have been new in a very strict sense: they were physically new but followed the circuit of the old city border. Finally, almost all accounts imply that Aurelian's walls were completed under this emperor,53 and therefore were started quite some time prior to 275. The Vita Aureliani, which connected Aurelian's alleged extension of the pomerium with military successes of that emperor later in his reign (see above), also shows that he began building the walls soon after coming to power. The people of Rome went against Aurelian because, according to the Vita, they were afraid 'that what had happened under Gallienus might occur once more'. Aurelius Victor and the Vita Aureliani remind us that when Italy was assaulted by the Germans in 259-60, at the time when Gallienus was away with his army, the fear was so great that the Senate, which had to take the defence of Rome into its own hands, armed a part of the citizenry.54 The words of the Vita, therefore, reveal that a similar sense of insecurity prompted Aurelian to strengthen the defence of the city at the very beginning of the 270s.55 Ostbalkanraum im Lichte der Miinzschatzfunde', ANRW 11.6 (1977), 144: 271; T.

How can we, then, explain the words of the Vita Aureliani (21.10-11) that this emperor 'extended the pomerium' only some time after he 'extended the walls' of Rome? It would be easy simply to discard these words as another fabrication of the Vita,57 but its reference that Aurelian paid attention to the pomerium later in his reign does not look like mere fantasy. The most convenient explanation would be that Aurelian first fortified Rome with the walls which he started to build in 271, after his war against the Marcomanni. The money came, at least in part, from confiscations that accompanied the repressions unleashed by Aurelian after he came to Rome from the Marcomannic war in early 271. A few years later, Aurelian renovated the pomerium of Rome, which was likely linked with his foundation of the temple of Sol after the Roman victory over Palmyra.58 Aurelian was following in the footsteps of Hadrian, who renovated the pomerium in 121,59 most likely in connection with the consecration of the temple of Venus and Rome.60 The significance of this temple is revealed by the fact that it was usually referred to as 'the temple of the City' (templum Urbis).61 The year 121 was also marked by the medallion with the image of the sow and her piglets, and by coins with the legend Saec(ulum) Aur(eum),62 which all carried the same message of the symbolic refoundation of Rome.63 The coins of Commodus, who planned to refound Rome as Colonia Lucia Aurelia Nova Commodiana, carry the images of that emperor, veiled as priest, ploughing, and the images of the new state deity Hercules Romanus ploughing with a bull and a cow; some such coins feature Commodus in the likeness of 56 E.g. Varro LL 5.143 and Liv. 1.44, who described the situation as it was in the Republican period; cf. Gell. NA 13.14.1. See B. Liou-Gille, 'Le pomerium', MusHelv 50 (1993), 96-8; Andreussi (n. 34), 96-8; Simonelli (n. 34), 119-36. 57 Syme (n. 37), 223-4 argued that this passage was added by the author of the Vita Aureliani. 58 Homo (n. 34), 184-95; Saunders (n. 10), 344-51; Watson (n. 33), 188-202; W Liebeschuetz, 'The significance of the speech of Praetextatus', in P.

But what they did was only to renovate the pomerium. It is possible that the extension of the pomerium attributed to Aurelian by his Vita similarly was a renovation. The building of the Roman walls by Aurelian and his renovation of the pomerium were not only chronologically distinct acts but also of different character. The walls had military importance, whereas the renovation of the pomerium came as part of Aurelian's religious reform only later. CONCLUSION Aurelian is usually remembered in connection with his important religious innovations, which have been interpreted as his attempt to strengthen the imperial power. The establishment of the cult of Sol, which was now Aurelian's patron deity,65 reflected important social and political changes during his reign. Coins featured Sol as Sol Dom(inus) Imp(erii) Rom(ani) and the emperor as Aurelianus Aug(ustus) Cons(ervator), thus blurring the lines between human and divine.66 Other coins showed Sol giving Aurelian a globe in a symbolic 'Solar investiture',67 which disconnected his rule from any human predecessor: his power came from a divinity, and was thus divine itself. Quite appropriately, Aurelian is said to have once subdued a mutiny of his troops by declaring that only the god had the authority to invest emperors with purple and establish the limits of their rule.68 He was also the first emperor who publicly wore a diadem together with jewelled and gilded robes. Aurelian also established a new college, the pontifici Dei Solis, whose task was to venerate Sol and, by extension, the emperor.69 However, Aurelian's religious and political innovations appear to have been founded on old Roman traditions. His political and financial amnesties were modelled on 64 The images of Commodus, veiled as a priest, ploughing: Col(onia) L. Au(relia) Com(modiana) in RIC III, 430 and 431 (190). The images of Hercules Romanus plowing: Herc(uli) Rom(ano) Conditori on 436 (Commodus presented as Hercules) and 437 (192). The two animals depicted on such images have been interpreted as 'two oxen': for example, H. Mattingly and E. A. Sydenham, RIC III, 394 (ad no. 247) and 436 (ad no. 616); H. Mattingly, Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV (London, 1968), 825 (ad no. 643), 827 (ad no. 658), 845 (ad no. 725); A. S. Robertson, Roman Imperial Coins in the Hunter Coin Cabinet. University of Gasgow. II. Trajan to Commodus (London, 1971), 442 (ad nos 159-61). But cf. D.C. 73.15.3: the golden statue representing Commodus with a bull and a cow. All this imagery related to Commodus' plan to refound Rome as Colonia Lucia Aurelia Nova Commodiana; cf. J. Aymard, 'Commode-Hercule Fondateur de Rome', REL 14 (1936), 350-64, esp. 356-8. Prior to that, Commodus had experimented with the image of Romulus Conditor: RIC III, 361 (189). 65 E.g. CIL VIII, 5143 = ILS 580 (275), and suppl. 4, 23924 (undated). Aurelian also introduced a new type of coins with Conservat(ori) Aug(usti), which carried the anthropomorphic image of Sol: RIC V.1, 307-8. 66 RIC V. 1, 301: Sol Dominus Imperi Romani, and 258-9, 264, 299. See Deus Aurelianus: CIL II, 3832 (after 275?), VIII, 4877 = ILS 585, VIII, 10217 = ILS 578 (274), XI, 556 = ILS 5687; AE 1938.24 (Valencia); G.

By declaring such amnesties, Aurelian presented his rule as abiding by old practices and attempted to improve his relations with the senators who regarded him as an usurper. Aurelian's most visible reform, which introduced the cult of Sol as the new state cult, included the traditional renovation of the pomerium, thus offering us another glimpse at a peculiar blend of innovations and traditions at this stage of the transformation of the Roman empire.70 Ball State University SVIATOSLAV DMITRIEV dmitriev@bsu.edu 70 I am indebted to the anonymous reader for very helpful comments and suggestions.</page></plain_text>
