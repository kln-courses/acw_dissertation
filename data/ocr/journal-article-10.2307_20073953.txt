<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Beuys Houston and London by JOHN-PAUL STONARD Courtauld Institute of Art, London at the beginning of October 1972 Johannes Rau, the Rhineland minister for Science and Education, gave orders for Joseph Beuys to be dismissed from his teaching post at the D?sseldorf Academy of Art, on the technical grounds of trespassing. In fact, in line with many other anti-authoritarian student activi ties occurring at the time, Beuys had for some time been defying the Academy's admissions procedure, and had relinquished control over the pedagogic structure of his class. He was clearly a major source of irritation to many of his colleagues. The director of the D?sseldorf Academy at that time, Norbert Kricke, com plained that Beuys 'plays the Messiah; he wants to convert us, he wants to let the Academy take over the role of the Church - that is, for me, his Jesu-Kitsch'.* Beuys's distinctive persona sharply divided reactions to his work. As well as those, such as Kricke, who resented inflated claims to spiri tual leadership, he attracted many dedicated advocates. Yet almost twenty years after his death the impact of Beuys himself on the display and understanding of his work is inevitably waning. Instead, new interpreta tions increasingly place his uvre - which still includes his extraordinary persona - in a broad historical, rather than purely biographical, context. Such an open view of the artist, supported by immaculate installation and inspired curatorship is evident in Joseph Beuys: Actions, Vitrines, Environments,2 first shown in a smaller version at the Menil Collection, Houston, and now at T?te Modern, Lon don (to 2nd May), where this reviewer saw it. The exhibition opens with the monolithic Fonds Vu/2 (1967/84; Fig.94), comprising eight large stacks of felt squares, each missing a small rectangle from a corner, seven topped with heavy copper sheets that compress the matted fibrous blocks. Each copper sheet features a handle, suggesting a liftable cover. Two composite copper rods and a ribbon filament of the same metallic element are included with the smallest stack. The filament connects the first stack with the second, but otherwise the stacks are only connected by their close arrangement, and by a uniform increase in height. Fonds VU/2 direcdy intro duces one of the most compelling themes in Beuys's uvre, the metaphor of energy storage (felt) and transmission (copper), in a sculptur al group that brings to mind the room-filling mainframe computers of the 1950s. Autobiographical resonances of the storage/ transmission theme are made clear in the early sculptural assemblage Voglio vedere le mie mon tagne (I want to see my mountains) (Fig.95). Begun in 1950, but first installed in the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, in 1971, the work is here displayed cordoned-offlike interiors in historic houses. It is in fact just that, comprised of furniture from Beuys's living and working arrangements 'during the 1950s'. A large heavy wardrobe, a cot bed, a yellow stool, an upright elongated packing case and a wooden box are positioned on copper plates, joined by narrow copper arms to form a circuit, as if to conduct memory-energy from object to object. The objects are positioned around a large hanging lamp, suspended four or five inches above a circle of felt, giving a sense of interior intimacy.

A wooden-butted rifle hangs on the back wall with the verb 'Denken1 ('to think') written (hardly legible in the current display) in chalk on the butt. A stump of ancient bog oak rests on a wooden box, a relic of natural antiquity, though seeming here peculiarly alive, a proxy for the artist, perhaps, a negative photograph of whom is hidden behind the wardrobe. Strassenbahnhaltestelle (Tram stop) is a later (1976) and much more public work, although autobiographical references remain. It matters less, however, that the objects on display here - four barrel-like shell cases, a length of iron tramline, a cast of a seventeenth-century cannon with a sculpture of a human head inserted into the ornamental mouth - were derived from a tram stop in Beuys's home town of Cleves. Personal sources have been transformed into a sculpture with its own res onances, especially poignant when Strassen bahnhaltestelle was first shown in the German pavilion at the 1976 Venice Biennale. Beuys's own learned activities are intro duced with wonderful concision in the show, summarising the link between his pedagogic efforts and his performances. Three black boards contain the artist's most famous propo sitions, in particular 'Kapital = Kunst9 ('Capital = Art'), with its suggestion of the capacity of art to store and transmit social values. Also the famous chalk-scrawl 'Jeder Mensch is ein K?nstler9 ('Everyone is an artist') which, like Warhol's 'Famous for fifteen minutes', appears in the current age of reality-TV more as a lament and warning than a recommendation. Also playing is the highly engaging video of the performance Hike America and America likes me, surrounded by fourteen photographs taken by Caroline Tisdall of Beuys interacting with a bemused coyote. Beuys's lecture and discussion held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery and the T?te Gal lery, London, in 1972, including the T?te lecture/action Information Action, are displayed alongside in the form of photographs, relic blackboards and a recendy re-edited video recording. Beuys's addresses to his London audience are a typical mixture of worldly innocence and prophetic profundity ? though perhaps erring on the side of the former. One of the hirsute attendees turns to his neighbour and shrugs, apparendy lost by Beuys's vague and seemingly infinite rhetoric. Beuys claimed that Marcel Duchamp's silence was overrated ? but what of his own volubility? The comparatively inscrutable Feuerst?tte I und Feuerst?tte II (Hearth I and hearth II) are shown in another cordoned corner-room ? in effect a single work, on loan for the first time since its definitive installation at the Kunst museum Basel in 1980. The exhibition guide tells us that the copper and iron rods, inter mingled with walking sticks, symbolise the 'permanent conference' Beuys proposed to stimulate democratic thought. A pile of felt suits originates from a carnival procession, which took place in Basel in the same year, 1977, when a controversy arose surrounding the acquisition of the work for 300,000 Swiss francs by the Kunstmuseum: Beuys joined in the procession, protested against the Kunst museum's purchase, and later included the revellers' outfits in the installation. In the second half of the exhibition, shown in natural light and with window views onto the Thames and St Paul's cathedral, the 1969 ensemble Das Rudel (The pack) has an extraor dinary impact. This is another notable loan, here on its first outing for over a quarter of a century from the Staatliche Museen, Kassel. Twenty-five toboggans spill from the back of a rusty, dirty Volkswagen van. Each toboggan contains a Beuysian survival-pack ? a small roll of felt, a 'Mares Double Star' flashlight, heavy enough to double as a cosh, and a waxy plug of fat. The toboggans have an impressive levered-braking system that could be appar endy applied to help break formation after group disembarkation. The brand name of the vehicles, 'Loucomb', has been overwritten by the 'Braunkreuz', Beuys's familiar signature in red next to a cross. Here, if anywhere, is vin dication for the spiritual claims of his work ? salvation means simple survival. Of all the works on display, Das Rudel is the most elo 96.

The pacing of the installation is once again perfecdy judged here as one moves into the claustrophobic staging of the 1974?75 Zeige deine Wunde (Show your wound), originally intended for one of Munich's many under ground passages but here on loan from the Munich Lenbachhaus. The geminous display strategy deprives each component - including two dissection tables, two pitchforks, two birds' skulls and two copies of the Italian socialist worker paper Lotta Continua, dis played in two white boxes - of its individual ity; each pair becomes, instead, exemplary but also curiously anthropomorphic, perhaps mirroring the symmetry of the human body. The purpose of dissection, digging and analy sis is stated by two large blackboards hanging on the back wall with the (again) very faint inscriptions 'Zeige deine Wunde9. Beuys's call for therapeutic remembrance has as much potency now as it did thirty years ago, as recent descriptions of the Allied bombard ment of Germany demonstrate.3 The theme of death and remembrance is continued by Das Ende des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts (The end of the twentieth century). In comparison with the streaming energy of Dos Rudel, thirty-one volcanic basalt slabs, dark where they have been worked through the light surface crust, lie scattered in prehistoric indolence. This is one of four versions of the work and the only one, as Sean Rainbird points out in his fascinating catalogue essay (see also his accompanying publication, Joseph Beuys and the Celtic World), that the artist did not himself install. The difficulty that this work now presents to museums is acute: should Beuys's own arrangements of other versions of the work be used as a pattern, or should a new interpretation be sought? Both cases will inevitably be judged in relation to the artist's absence. Does this result in a loss of authenticity for the work, or does the work ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^pB|j^^H|^^^^^^^^^^^^^B 95.

Further, would it be better if there were no patterns to follow, simply the objects and a feeling of the ideas behind them? A purely archaeological approach, aided with global positioning tech nology, as was the case with the transference of a version of Das Ende des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts from the Haus der Kunst to the new Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, risks losing that feeling. By contrast, the room of vitrines displayed at the heart of the exhibition space is full of excitement and interest. Here we find three groups of white wooden glass-fronted cases, each containing an ensemble of objects, arranged by the artist himself. It is certainly an effective way of displaying - staging, even - these vagrant and heterogeneous objects. Many of the themes broached in the larger environments are here recreated in cabinet format. The 1984 vitrine Incontro con Beuys (Encounter with Beuys) contains felt rolls swad dling a solid copper pole and plate, and felt and fat 'limbs', like skinned legs, bound with cord. Its brass display stand distinguishes it from the other cases. The strong sense of this case as a reliquary, containing the decaying talismanic bones of the artist, suggests a read ing that chimes with Beuys's broader 'trans valuation' of basic elements and materials ? a reading explored in the 1997 Cologne exhibi tion Joseph Beuys und das Mittelalter. Yet if Incontro con Beuys suggests a contemporary cult of relics, then it also has an important histori cal context. Photographs taken of Germany after 1945 show how towns and cities had been reduced to uniform heaps of rubble by Allied bombing. Just as places were 'dis placed', so things - blood, fat and soil includ ed ? were devalued and emptied of meaning. Beuys took the stuff of post-War life and re inserted it into history, demonstrating an extraordinary awareness both of the meta phoric association and the sensual, physical properties of materials. Those who have experienced possibly his greatest work, Plight (1985), will understand what this sensory hit can mean. The final work, Wirtschaftswerte (Economic values) of 1980 (Fig.96), is a coup de th??tre iUuminating Beuys's commitment both to philosophical questions of value and the possibility of political and socially engaged art. Post-War Germany provided a unique con trolled experiment in economic planning, one that required before too long the building of a wall to separate the two economic systems. Wirtschaftswerte shows dusty shelves meagrely covered with East German produce (Beuys made one visit to the GDR, staying for a single day). The walls surrounding the instal lation are, according to the artist's instruc tions, covered with paintings from the host museum's collection ? here in fact Henry Tate's founding gift to the gallery. The ques tions asked in this particular environment ? a collision of value systems - are still as engag ing as they were a quarter of a century ago, perhaps more so now that the work has had time to acquire a life and history of its own. 1 J.F.
