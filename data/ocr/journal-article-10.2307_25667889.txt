<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF PHILOSOPHY AT THE PRESENT TIME.1 BY EDWARD CAIRD. In complying with the request which you have done me the honor to make, to deliver the introductory address to this Society, I think that, instead of treating of any special philosophical sub ject, it will be more profitable to make some general remarks on the nature and objects of the study to which the Society is de voted. I propose, therefore, to say something as to the general 1 An introductory address delivered to the Philosophical Society of the University of Edinburgh.</page><page sequence="2">28 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. problem of philosophy, and the special forms which that problem has taken in recent times. In doing so, it will not be possible for me to avoid an appearance of dogmatism, as I must make some assertions which are much disputed, the objections to which I shall not have time to discuss. But, instead of interpolating weak ening phrases, such as "it humbly appears to me," and the like, I venture simply to make this apology once for all, and to ask you to adopt, for the time, a point of view which may not be your own. Afterwards you can avenge yourselves for this temporary submis sion by subjecting my words to what criticism you think fit, A philosophic temper is shown, above all things, in the power of en tering into the views of another, and taking them for the moment almost as if they were your own, without prejudice to the subse quent critical reaction, which will be effective just in proportion to the degree of your previous sympathetic appreciation of the ideas criticised. What, then, is the task of philosophy ? What is its task in gen eral, and how is that task modified by the circumstances of the present time? To the first of these questions, I answer that, stated in very general terms, the task of philosophy is to gain, or rather perhaps to regain, such a view of things as shall reconcile us to the world and to ourselves. The need for philosophy arises out of the broken harmony of a spiritual life, the different elements or fac tors of which seem to be set in irreconcilable opposition to each other; in which, for example, the religious consciousness, the con sciousness of the infinite, is at war with the secular consciousness, the consciousness of the finite; or, again, the consciousness of the self, with the consciousness of the external world. It is easy to see this, if we reflect on the nature of the controversies which most trouble us at present. They all, directly or indirectly, turn upon the difficulty of reconciling the three great terras of thought?the world, self, and God: the difficulty of carrying out to their legiti mate consequences what seem to be our most firmly based convic tions as to any one of these factors in our intellectual life, without rejecting in whole or in part the claims of the others. Thus, for ex ample, many writers in the present time find it impossible to ad mit the truth and solidity of the principles and methods of physi cal science in relation to the material world without extending their application beyond that world. Yet, if we make this exten</page><page sequence="3">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 29 sion, and treat these methods and principles as universal, we in evitably reduce consciousness, thought, and will, to the level of physical phenomena, and make even their existence an insoluble problem. Others, again, find it difficult to assert the truth, that the consciousness of self enters into all our experience, without reducing that experience to a series of states of the individual soul. And others, like Mr. Spencer and Professor Huxley, poised be tween these two conflicting currents of thought, have adopted the odd, and we might even say irrational, expedient of telling us that we may regard the world either as a collection of the phenomena of mind, or as a collection of the phenomena of matter, but that we can never bring these two ways of looking at things together? a view which supposes man to be afflicted with a kind of intellec tual strabismus, so that he can never see with one of his mental eyes without shutting the other. Again, looking beyond this con flict of materialism and subjective idealism, the intellectual unity of our life is disturbed by the opposition of the consciousness of the infinite to the consciousness of the finite. To many of our sci entific men it seems axiomatic that all our real knowledge is of that which belongs to the context of a finite experience, and that all religious and metaphysical efforts to reach beyond the finite are attempts to think the unknown and unknowable. Yet such men often feel strongly the need, and,' from their point of view, the extreme difficulty, of finding anything to give to the moral life of man that support which was once found in the belief that these dreams are realities. On the other hand, there are not a few men in pur day?like the hero of that remarkable little book called " Mark Rutherford "?men whose very life is in religious ideas, yet who have imbibed from the literature of the time a conviction that such ideas must be illusory, and who therefore dwell, as it were, in a world of eclipse and paralysis, neither able to find a faith nor to do without one, sitting 44 by the broken springs of life, Waiting for the morrow that shall free them from the strife." Now, it is impossible, so long as our ultimate thought of the world is thus in discord with itself, that our lives can be what hu man lives have sometimes been?impossible that we can rise to that energy of undivided will and affection, that free play of con 3</page><page sequence="4">30 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. centrated intelligence, that sense of the infinite resources of the spirit that moves us, out of which the highest achievements of men at all times have sprung. Nor, after the unity of our first instinct ive faith has been broken by difficulties such as those I have men tioned, is it possible entirely to recover it, except by some kind of philosophical reflection. Bacon said that in the last period of ancient civilization philosophy took the place of religion, and the same is to some extent true now. In face of the modern spirit of criticism, it is rarely possible for educated men, and for students of philosophy impossible, to rest for the entire support of their spiritual life upon the simple intuitions of faith. For them the age of unconsciousness is past, and they must call in the aid of reflection, if it were only to heal the wounds of reflection itself. As the builders of the second Temple had to work with arms by their side, so, in our day, those who seek either to maintain, or to replace, the old Christian synthesis of life, must provide themselves with the weapons of philosophy. It is not of our own choice that we have been born in an age of criticism ; but, being here, and being by our education brought face to face with all the prevalent currents of thought, we have only two alternatives before us: we must face our difficulties, or we must suppress them. To suppress them?we see often enough what kind of moral temper comes of that?the fevered fanatical spirit that founds its faith on the im possibility of knowing anything, and determines to believe, be cause it dare not do otherwise. Yet, if we are not content with such faith, we must seek the reconciliation of the contradictory olempints of our consciousness in some new reflective synthesis ; in other words, in philosophy. The task of philosophy, then, I repeat, is to rise to such a gen eral view of things as shall reconcile us, or enable us to reconcile ourselves, to the world and to ourselves. This vague statement, however, might easily be admitted by many who will be startled and repelled when we draw out its meaning. For it means no less than this, that philosophy, by the very condition of its life, is -forced to attempt what Comtists have called an "objective," or what perhaps might more properly be termed an " absolute" syn thesis. It is true that many philosophers, and even great philoso phers, have tried to evade this necessity, and to narrow the prob lem of philosophy within limits which made its solution seem</page><page sequence="5">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 31 easier. Especially in times of transition, when social bonds have become relaxed, and religious faith has been weakened or de stroyed, philosophy also has generally lowered its claims, and has been content to abandon the great world to chaos, if only it could secure some little cosmos of its own. To these causes of diffi dence in philosophy others in recent times have been added ; for our very widening knowledge of the universe has thrown a shadow of suspicion upon the attempt to measure it, and has inclined us to narrow our views to a solution of the problem of human life, and to disconnect it from the problem of the unity of all things, dan we not, it is natural to ask, find a meaning in our own lives without spelling out the secret of the universe? Can we not build our fragile houses of mortality on something less than an eternal foundation ? With the growth of our knowledge grows also the consciousness of our ignorance, and more and more the latter seems to reduce the former into something merely relative and transitional. Looking out upon the wide sea of knowledge, with some measure of appreciation of its extent, it seemed but reasonable for one like Comte to say that an "objective synthe sis," a systematic view of the world as a whole, was beyond the reach of man ; and that, if his life was to be brought into harmo ny with itself on a basis of knowledge, he must content himself with a " subjective synthesis," a synthesis which leaves out all speculation in relation to the greater whole of the universe, and attempts only to gather knowledge to a focus in the interests of man. In taking up this position, Comte, it has been urged by his followers, showed a true insight into our needs as rational beings, who must desire to bring our lives into harmony and unity with themselves, and to found that harmony and unity upon an intelli gent view of the facts of our condition; and he showed at the same time an intelligent appreciation of the limits which are set around us as finite creatures, standing in the face of a universe, the ultimate meaning of which is hidden from us by the weakness of our mental capacity and the narrowness of our opportunities. Comtek view of things is thus based upon two incontrovertible facts?the limitation of man's powers, and the imperative wants of his moral being. The old aspiring religious and philosophical synthesis, he argues, has been discredited forever by our knowl edge of the immensity of the universe and of our own feebleness.</page><page sequence="6">32 Ths Journal of Speculative Philosophy. It is impossible for the creature of a day to see things sub specie ceternitalis, for a finite mind to carry back the infinity of the uni verse to its central principle, to view it as a harmonious system, and, like a god, to pronounce it " very good." But yet there re mains the inextinguishable requirement of a rational and moral nature to rise above chance impulses and energies and to find some one guiding principle of thought and action which shall make his life harmonious with itself. And this principle, since we can not find it in an Absolute, whom we do not know, we must find in man?man individual, or man social?whom we do know. Re nouncing, therefore, all questions as to the system of the universe, even the question whether it is a system, we can still draw back upon ourselves and find and produce system and harmony in our own lives. Or, if this is impossible for us as regards the frag mentary existence of the individual, we may yet detect in the his tory of the human race a tendency towards unity and organization to which all the great and good of the past have contributed, and we may give value and completeness to our individual lives by making them the instruments of this "increasing purpose." The question which Comte thus bring3 home to us is, as I have already indicated, not a new one. It is the question whether it is possible to have a religion?i. e., " a free convergence of all man's affections and energies " to one object?without a God ; and a phi losophy?i. e., a synthesis or gathering to one focus of all knowl edge?without an Absolute.1 And this is a question that has been raised more or less distinctly in every era of transition, when the " native hue " of human resolution has been "sicklied o'er with a pale cast of thought," and when men have been fain to gather up the fragments that remained in the shipwreck of their greater faiths and hopes. The individualism of the stoics, epicureans,, and sceptics, for example, corresponding as it did with the decay of ancient religion and social morality, was in great measure a result of such a temper of mind. As men gave up the hope of organizing their own social relations, and of understanding the world as an intelligible order, they fell back upon the idea of an inner life, which might maintain harmony with itself in the face 1 Cf. The Unity of Comie't Life and Doctrine, by J. H. Bridges. London: Triibner &amp; Co., 1866.</page><page sequence="7">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 33 even of an outward chaos. Philosophy, it began to be said, is needed, not to penetrate into the secret of the world, which is im penetrable, but to teach us our limits and to make us content with them. Tecum hahita et noris quam sit tibi curta supellex. Yet that curta supellex is enough ; the peace of inward unity may be attained, even if we know nothing and can do nothing in the world without. Sure of nothing else, the individual may be sure of himself, and, in the strength of a mind centred and at rest in itself, may cease to concern himself with things that can only touch the outward life. Sifractus illabatur orbis, Impavidum ferient ruince. Now, I need not dwell on the self-contradiction of this extreme of " subjective " synthesis, in which all that is without is aban doned to chaos or uncertainty, in order that the integrity of the inner life may be preserved. It is a commonplace of philosophy that we cannot thus withdraw into ourselves and leave the world to wander its own wise or unwise way, inasmuch as the two terms thus separated by abstraction are essentially united, and our ex perience of the world is our experience of ourselves. The life of reason or consciousness is essentially a life that goes beyond itself, and in which the inward cannot be absolutely fenced off from the outward without itself ceasing to have any meaning or content. It is a life of knowledge, in which we can know ourselves only as we know the universe of which, as individuals, we form a part. It is a life of action, in which we can realize ourselves only by becoming the servants of an end which is being realized in the world. Concentrate consciousness entirely upon itself, and its un reflected light will cease to shine. The world without and the world within are not two separate worlds, but necessary counter parts of each other ; and, just in the extent to which we succeed in withdrawing from the world without, we narrow the world within. The attitude, therefore, of the stoic or sceptic who turns away from a world which he surrenders to chaos and unreason, or in which, at least, he gives up the hope of seeing or producing any rational order, and who seeks thus to find all truth and happiness within, is essentially irrational. He is striving to realize in isola tion a life whose essential characteristic is community. He is 3 * XYI?3</page><page sequence="8">34 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. seeking to save the life of the seed, which must be cast into the ground and die, that it may live, by keeping it shut up from all external influences. For the Christian law of self-sacrifice, " he that would save his life must lose it," is nothing more than the transcription into terms of morality of that which is the general law of spiritual life?a life whose riches are always for the indi vidual exactly measured by the extent to which he breaks down the limits of a self centred individuality, to find himself again in larger existence of the whole. But if this be the case, and if it is impossible to solve the problem of the inner life without solving the apparently wider problem of the outer life, or to base on a purely subjective syn thesis a reconciliation of the spirit with itself, such as was for merly based on the objective synthesis of religion or philoso phy, equally impossible is it to draw any other absolute line of division, such, for example, as that between the life of the na tion and the life of humanity, or, again, between the life of hu manity and the course of nature. In every similar division we are separating elements so correlated that the meaning of each one of them begins to evaporate so soon as we realize what we have done in separating it from the rest. To make such an ab straction must introduce a fatal discord between the practical life of man and the facts upon which we pretend to base it. And, indeed, as I think can be shown in the case of Comte, such an attempt involves the self-deception of treating that as absolute and divine which we at the same time admit to be uncertain and transitory.1 How, for example, can we make a God out of hu manity if we think of mankind as a race of beings which is not really organic, but in which there is only a general tendency to organization?a tendency which again is subjected to an immeas urable external contingency. Comte's attempt to escape the great difficulties which confessedly beset an optimistic creed?the creed that in some way all things wrork together for good?by thus falling back from the assertion of system in the universe to the assertion of system only in the life of man, like most com 1 I have attempted to show this in a series of articles on " The Social Philosophy and Religion of Comte," which appeared in the Contemporary Review in May, June, July, and September, 1879. ^</page><page sequence="9">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 35 promises, unites all the difficulties of both extremes it would avoid ; the difficulties of an absolute philosophy which seems to go beyond the limits of human knowledge, and the difficulties ot a scepticism which leaves the moral and intellectual life of man without a principle of unity. The Stoic or Sceptic who bids us concentrate ourselves on our own soul, and the Positivist, who bids us worship humanity, are equally bidding us treat a part, which we can know and understand only as a part, as if it were the whole. They are attempting to break in one place only the indivisible unity of the intelligence and the intelligible world ; but if that unity be broken in one place it is wholly destroyed. Fal sus in uno, falsus in omnibus. For it is a unity which is not like a particular hypothesis, that may be asserted or denied with out detriment to the rest of our knowledge, but it is the hypothe sis, if we may so call it, which is implied in all knowledge what ever, the hypothesis which constitutes our rational being. Hence Kant showed a true sense of the conditions of philosophical synthesis when he said that, if it could be shown that there was one metaphysical problem with which his Critique of Pure Reason was incompetent to deal, it must be regarded as an entire failure. If philosophy is incapable of a universal synthesis, it cannot make any synthesis at all. If it admit any absolute divi sion, whether between the ego and the non-ego, or between man and nature, or even between the finite and the infinite, it is driven of necessity into scepticism. Unless it reconciles us with the universe, it cannot even reconcile us with ourselves. The present is a time in which there are many voices to echo the well-known saying of Pope? " Know well thyself, presume not God to scan, The proper study of mankind is man;" but the simple, yet demonstrable, answer to such partial Agnosti cism is, that, if we cannot, in the sense I have indicated, know God, we cannot know anything. But if this be so, if we cannot give up the idea of a universal synthesis without practically giving up philosophy altogether, we must not hide from ourselves the enormous difficulties with which philosophy has to contend?difficulties which seem to grow every day with our increasing knowledge of man and of the world in</page><page sequence="10">36 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. which he lives. For all this knowledge seems to be making wider and wider the division between the individual arid the universal, between short-sighted, changeable creatures such as men seem to be, and the all-embracing whole. These difficulties, however, though they by no means disappear, yet somewhat change their character, when we consider that the work cf philosophy is not in the first instance constructive, but rather critical and reconstruc tive; that its business is not to seek for something transcendent, some hypothesis as to things hitherto unknown and alien to our experience, but rather to bring to light the hypothesis, if we choose to call it so, on which our rational being is founded. Phi losophy must necessarily seem to be something extravagant and wildly ambitious to any one who does not discern that the prob lem it would solve is not one which arbitrarily, or as a matter merely of curiosity, we choose to solve, but one which we have in some way been solving, or of which we have been presupposing the solution, at every moment of our lives. To rise from the finite to the infinite were impossible unless the consciousness of the infinite were already involved in the consciousness of the finite, and developed along with it. Philosophy is not a first venture into a new field of thought, but a re-thinking of a secular and religious consciousness which has been developed, in the main, independently of philosophy. It was the great work of Kant to show that experience itself is possible only through the necessity and universality of thought. But in thus proving the relativity of the finite objects of experience to the intelligence (which is not itself such an object), he really showed?though without himself being fully conscious of it, and almost, we might say, against his will?that we cannot admit the validity of the empirical con sciousness without admitting the validity of the consciousness of that which, in tne narrower sense of the word, is beyond experi ence. Hence, to one who follows out the Kantian principles to their legitimate result, it becomes impossible to treat the objective synthesis of religion as the illusion of a finite mind trying to stretch itself beyond its proper limits. The religious takes its place beside the secular consciousness?the consciousness of the infinite beside the consciousness of the finite world?as the con sciousness of a real object, or rather of the ultimate reality upon which everything else rests. And philosophy, in dealing with</page><page sequence="11">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 37 one as with the other, is discharged from the absurd and impossi ble feat of finding its way into a transcendent region beyond all consciousness and experience. In both cases, in relation to the infinite as in relation to the finite world, the work of philosophy goes beyond the primary unreflected consciousness o? man, only in this aspect, that it brings that consciousness to a deeper under standing of itself. In both we have a right to begin our task of criticism and reconstruction with a faith in the great work achieved in and by the spirit of man in the past; and we ought to begin it with the consciousness that our criticism and recon struction can have value only as a continuation of that work. For it is this consciousness that alone can justifiably raise us above the feeling of our own weakness for the task which is laid upon philosophy in our time, and can save us from the intruding sus picion that in his religions and his philosophies man has been perpetually renewing the history of Babel?attempting to build a tower that shall reach to heaven, only to find the work again and again stopped by the confusion of languages among the builders. If, therefore, philosophy may be described as a critical reconstruc tion of belief,'we must recollect that this reconstruction, from a higher point of view, is merely development; or, to put it more simply, we must remember that, in philosophy as in other things, the hope of mankind for the future must be a vain illusion, unless it can reasonably be based on a deep reverence for the past. In the " Faust " of Goethe, the poet who of all others has most deeply fathomed and expressed the conflict of the modern spirit with itself?though it may perhaps be said that, like a physician strong in diagnosis but not in therapeutics, he often stops at the description of the disease, and finds his own poetic deliverance from it simply in thus describing it1?we find some words that may be applied to the work of philosophy. When Faust utters all his despair of life in that comprehensive curse in which he dis i " Physician of the iron age, Goethe has done his pilgrimage.. He took the suffering human race, He read each wound, each weakness clear, And struck his finger on the place, And said: Thou attest here, and here / " Arnold's Poems, vol. ii, p. 223.</page><page sequence="12">38 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. owns every faith, and even every illusion that has hitherto sup ported mankind, the chorus of spirits breaks in with a song, in which lament over what has been lost is mingled with a far-off hint of the only possible restoration? " Woe, woe, thou hast destroyed it, The beautiful world, With mighty blow; It trembles, it falls to ruins. A Demigod hath broken it down. We bear away the ruins into nothingness, And lament over the lost beauty." And then the song goes on? "Mighty One Of the sons of earth, With greater majesty Build it up, In thine own soul build it up again ; A new course of life Begin, With fresh unclouded sense, And let new songs rise In place of those that are silenced." " In thine own soul build it up again "?this is the ever-repeated call to philosophy at all times, such as the present, when the first unity of faith and reason is disturbed. But the task has become, if in some respects a harder, yet in other respects a more hopeful one in modern times. That this is so may be shown by a short comparison of the form in which the problem presented itself to Plato and Aristotle with the form in which it presents itself to us. In Plato's " Republic " we find an attempt to u build up again in the soul" of the philosopher the falling edifice of Greek civili zation, to restore its religious and political life, by going back to the ideal principle on which it rested. But the difficulty of such restoration lay in this, that the first intuitive synthesis of Greece was a synthesis of the imagination, in which that which was essen tially limited and national was treated as unlimited and universal. Greek morality did not look beyond the boundary of the nation, seldom even beyond the boundary of the civic state. Greek re</page><page sequence="13">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 39 ligion, as it was an apotheosis of the special gifts of the Greek genius, was in some measure a consecration of the national spirit of exclusion. Hence, neither religion nor morality could offer an effective resistance to the disintegrating power of reflection. As it was the poetic imagination mainly which had peopled Olympus with the fair humanities of the gods, the power of Greek religion disappeared almost as soon as the people became capable of dis tinguishing poetry from prose. And, as, in the ethical life of the Greek state, the local and temporal was rather confused than reconciled with that which is universal, it fell an easy prey to the casuistry of the Sophists. On the other hand, the scepticism of the Sophists remained superficial and rhetorical, just because it found so little power of resistance in the institutions which it at tacked. When, therefore, philosophy in Plato and Aristotle set itself to the task of reconstructing the synthesis upon which the moral and intellectual life of Greece was founded, and restoring the broken harmony of faith and reason, its reconciliation was necessarily imperfect, because of the imperfection of the positive and negative elements which it sought to reconcile. It tried to combine the freedom of thought which had shown itself in the Sophistic movement with the substantial contents of Greek life, morality, and religion, which Sophistry had rejected. But the freedom and universality of thought were in essential conflict with the limited character of the contents ; and even to Plato himself a merely imaginative religion could not be more than a " noble lie," i. a truth veiled under an inadequate sensuous form. The ele ment of philosophy in which the reconciliation was attempted was itself fatal to the reconciliation aimed at. Hence, already in Plato we find the beginning of that withdrawal into the inner life from an unideal world, which was carried out in subsequent phi losophy, and which of necessity ended in the self-contradiction of scepticism. The modern movement from faith to reason bears a striking analogy to the movement of ancient thought. Yet there are im portant differences, which make the struggle of tendencies in modern times harder and more obstinate, but which also for that very reason enable us to anticipate a more satisfactory result. Here, too, we have a system of religion apprehended by the in tuitive consciousness of faith, and manifesting itself in definite</page><page sequence="14">40 The. Journal of Speculative Philosophy. forms of intellectual and social life. Here, too, we have the spirit of reflection after a time awaking and subjecting the whole re ligious system, as well as all the institutions founded upon it, to a searching, and often a destructive criticism. And here, too, we find philosophy attempting to restore the broken harmony of man's consciousness of himself and of the world by separating the permanent from the transitory elements of his earlier faith. But beneath this general similarity of development there are many points of contrast?which we may roughly sum up by say ing that the first synthesis of Christendom took the form of a religion which was not national, but universal, and that the negative movement against it has been not merely analytic and sophistic, but also scientific, and, therefore, within certain limits, constructive. Hence, also, just because of the deeper spiritual meaning and fuller development of the two seemingly opposed powers that divide our life, we have some reason to think that it may be possible to combine what is good in both, and to attain to a philosophical synthesis, which may be not merely provisional, but of permanent value for mankind. Let me say a few more words on each of these points. The religion of Greece was, as I have said, national, not uni versal, and for that very reason it was essentially a religion of the artistic imagination ; for it is the imagination which lifts the part into a whole, and makes a particular into a substitute for the uni versal. It has been called an anthropomorphic religion ; but, as Hegel has remarked, in the higher sense it was not anthropmor phic enough?it lifted some human qualities into the divine, but not humanity itself as such. Its gods were ideal figures, human ized, rather than human?fixed like statues in the eternal repose of beauty, and lifted above all the narrowing conditions of human life. Christianity, on the other hand, brought down the divine into the form of an individual life lived under those conditions, struggling with the wants and pains of mortality and the opposi tion of fellow-mortals, and undergoing and accepting the common lot of renunciation, sorrow, and death. It thus idealized, not choice specimens of intelligence and valor, but humanity itself, in its simplest and humblest form of life. It taught the world not to regard the ideal as something which a few elect spirits might reach, by escaping from the commonplace of existence, but to</page><page sequence="15">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 41 find it in the commonplace itself; to make the limits of mortal ity the means of freedom, and to turn pain, death, and even evil, into forms of the manifestation of ?food. Now, this optimism on the very basis of pessimism, whose Christ has u descended into hell," this idealization of ordinary reality as it stands without selection or change, just because it was this, was no religion of phantasy, of art, of the poetic imagination merely. It did not flinch from the facts of life, however dark and threatening, or seek to turn its eyes to some earthly paradise lifted above the clouds and the winds. Art in it was secondary, not primary ; in its poetry truth was bursting through the sensuous veil. And from this it neces sarily follows that it is not a dream that vanishes with a waking of the prosaic consciousness in either of its shapes, either as the distinct common-sense apprehension of fact, or as the reflective analysis of thought. Whatever changes of form, therefore, it has been and may yet be subjected to (and I do not say that these will be small), the Christian view of the world in its essence is based upon such a simple acknowledgment of the truth and reality of things that it need not fear overthrow, either from our widening knowledge of the facts of life, or from the deeper self consciousness to which reflection is gradually bringing us. In the midst even of apparent rejection its ideals have maintained and increased their hold over the emancipated intelligence of Europe, and its fundamental conception of life penetrates and moulds the social and religious speculations of those who, like Comte, seem to have most thoroughly renounced it. On the other hand, if the first intuitional basis of modern life is thus strong in itsolf, strong, too, it must be acknowledged, are the powers that assail it. The sophistic culture that undermined the old beliefs of Greece, and the morality founded upon them, was but a feeble solvent, compared with the disintegrating force of negative reflection and scientific criticism to which our faiths are subjected. The boldness of the ancient sceptic was chilled by a sense of the weakness of his own position. He might set the human against the divine, the individual against the State, the finite and relative against the infinite and absolute ; but he was paralyzed by the negative character of his own teaching, by the consciousness that his emancipation of the intellect was a process whereby it was emptied of all contents, and that his liberation of</page><page sequence="16">42 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. the individual from limited social bonds could lead to nothing better than anarchy. In modern times, on the other hand, it has ceased to be so. The world of finite interests and objects has rounded itself, as it were, into a separate whole, within which the mind of man can fortify itself, and live securus adversus deos, in independence of the infinite. In the sphere of thought, there ha3 been forming itself an ever-increasing body of science, which, tracing out the relation of finite things to finite things, never finds it necessary to seek for a beginning or an end to its infinite series of phenomena, and which meets the claims of theology with the saying of the astronomer, u I do not need that hypothesis." In the sphere of action, again, the complexity of modern life pre sents a thousand isolated interests, crossing each other in ways too subtle to trace out?interests commercial, social, and political?in pursuing one or other of which the individual may find ample occupation for his existence, without ever feeling the need of any return upon himself, or seeing any reason to ask himself whether this endless striving has any meaning or object beyond itself. Nor need we wonder that the prevailing school of philosophy is one which renounces all such questions as vain, and bids us be content to know that we know nothing. The very wealth of modern life and science, both because it makes the ultimate syn thesis more difficult, and because it supplies us with such a fulness of interests independent of that synthesis, tends to drive us back to the old, simple Agnostic philosophy of the Persian poet, Omar Khayyam : " Myself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and sage, and heard great argument About it and about, but evermore Came out by the same door that in I went. " With them the seed of wisdom did I sow, And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow; And this was all the harvest that I reaped; I came like water, and like wind I go. " There was a door to which I found no key, There was a veil through which I could not see. Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee There was: and then no more of Thee and Me."</page><page sequence="17">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 43 The Agnosticism and Secularism of these latter days, however, has a far deeper meaning than that which we can attribute to the verses of Omar Khayyam, or to any similar phase of opinion in past time. It is like in expression?as, indeed, in the first aspect of them, all negations seem to be much alike. But just as the ordinary commonplaces about the sorrows and trials of life have a greater significance when they fall from the lips of age and experi ence than when they are merely the utterance of the first dawn ing thoughtfulness of youth, so our modern Agnosticism implies a deeper consciousness of the problem of human existence than could possibly have been obtained by Omar Khayyam. For it is based, not on a mere Epicurean concentration upon the individual life, nor on the materialism of passion, but on our knowledge of the greatness of the universe, and on the complexity of finite inter ests, both practical and scientific, which seem to stand on their own merits, and to need no reference to anything higher, in order to recommend them as sufficient objects of our lives. A consideration of these two main elements of modern thought enables us to understand why the struggle of positive and negative tendencies?of the consciousness of the infinite with the conscious ness of the finite, of the religious with the secular spirit?should be so much more violent and protracted than the analogous con flict in earlier times. A religion which is universal and not merely imaginative, and a reflection which is scientific and not merely analytic or destructive, are each of them charged with interests vital to man; and, so long as they are opposed as enemies, they are necessarily involved in a contest which is incapable of being decided by any final victory on one side or the other. Man, as he has an understanding, cannot but acknowledge the facts of his finite life, and, in view of them, he must sooner or later withdraw his allegiance from every ideal that doss not prove itself to be real, and renounce every belief which is found inconsistent with the laws of thought or the nature of experience. Yet, on the other hand, as he is a self-conscious being, who knows the world in rela tion to the self, and who, therefore, cannot but realize more or less distinctly the unity of all things and of the mind that knows them, he must equally reject any attempt to confine him to the finite world. Nor, however he may seek, in accordance with imperfect theories of knowledge, to limit himself to that world, can he ever</page><page sequence="18">44 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. really succeed in confining his thoughts within it. All our knowl edge of the things of time is, so to speak, on a background of eternity itself. The scientific impulse itself presupposes the pres ence in our minds of an idea of truth as the ultimate unity of being and knowing, which in all our inquiries into the laws of the uni verse we can only develop and verify. For it is just because we are obscurely conscious, even from the beginning of this unity, that we regard every apparent discord of things with each other as a mystery and a problem, and so are continually seeking law and unity?in other words, seeking thought, in things, with the confidence that ultimately it must be found there. In like man ner the practical impulse, whenever it goes beyond, as in every conscious being it must somewhat go beyond, a craving for the satisfaction of immediate sensuous wants, implies the presence in our minds of an idea of absolute good, which is at once the realiza tion of the self and of a divine purpose in the world. What, in deed, could we possibly hope from our feeble efforts after a good, which is only gradually defining itself before us as we advance, if we did not believe that they unite themselves with the great stream of tendency which is independent of us? How could we think to attain our "being's end and aim" if we did not regard it ulti mately identical with the " divine event to which the whole crea tion moves ?" Hence a sober philosophy, admitting to the full all that can be said by the Agnostic about the feebleness of the pow ers of men as individuals, and the greatness of the universe, can yet reject the Agnostic conclusion from these premises, and can maintain that an absolute or objective synthesis is no mere dream of the childhood of the human race, when the distinction between the possible and the impossible had not yet been made, but rather that it is a task forced upon us by our rational nature, and which, as rational beings,we cannot but attempt, withmore or less distinct ness of consciousness, to fulfil. All thought and action, all moral and intellectual life, presupposes in us the power of looking at things, not from the point of view of our own individuality, but in ordine ad universum / and whatever presumption there is in the idea of a universal synthesis is already involved in our exist ence as rational or self-conscious beings. Philosophy may, there fore, begin its work by a vindication of the religious consciousness ?the consciousness of the infinite?as presupposed in that very</page><page sequence="19">The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time. 45 consciousness of the finite which at present often claims to ex clude it altogether, or to reduce it to an empty apotheosis of the unknown and unknowable. And having thus taught us to regard the consciousness of the infinite as no mere illusion, but as the consciousness of a real object, an Absolute, a God, who has been revealing himself in and to man in all ages, philosophy must go on to consider the history of religion, and indeed the whole history of man as founded on religion, as the progressive development of this consciousness. Nor can it fail to discover that the idea on which the higher life of man is founded?the idea of the unity of man as spiritual with an absolute spirit?has in Christianity been brought to light and made in a manner apprehensible by all. Whatever, therefore, may be the change of form to which this idea may have to submit in being applied to our ever-widening knowledge of nature and man, and whatever developments of it may be necessary ere it can solve the difficulties suggested by this increasing knowledge, we have good reason to be confident that we have in it a principle of universal synthesis which is adequate to the task. On the other side, while this is true, it is also true that philoso phy cannot conclusively meet the attacks of scientific criticism, except by coming into closer relation with the work of finite sci ence than it has ever hitherto done ; for the only true answer to such attacks is to show that the facts and laws upon which they rest are capable of a higher interpretation than that which has been drawn from them by those who have attended to these facts and laws alone. Philosophy, therefore, in face of the increasing complexity of modern lite, has a harder task laid upon it than ever was laid upon it before. It must emerge from the region of abstract principles and show that it can deal with the manifold re sults of empirical science, giving to each of them its proper place and value. If it ever could sit " upon a hill remote " to reason of "fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute," it may not d6 so now. Within, as without, the special province of philosophy, the times are past when, to give spiritual help to men, it was sufficient to have a deep intuitive apprehension of a few great principles of spiritual life, and to denounce the representatives of empirical knowledge and finite interests as sophists, u apostles of the dismal science," and " apes of the Dead Sea." We may be thankful to 4</page><page sequence="20">46 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. our Carlyles and Euskins, as we are in higher measure to the great men of their type in earlier time?men who utter in powerful language the primary truths of morality and religion?even when they express these truths in a one-sided and intolerant way, refus ing to pay due regard to the achievements of finite science, and treating with contempt every improvement that does not involve a fundamental change of man's moral being. But it is, after all, a mark of weakness to address the modern world with the un guarded utterances of an ancient prophet. To repeat against men like Mill and Darwin the old watch-words with which Plato at tacked the sophists is, to say the least of it, an anachronism; for it is to refuse to recognize how far such men are from being soph ists, and how much of the spirit of Plato they have imbibed. And it is to forget, on the other hand, that philosophy has a differ ent task from that which it had in the days of Plato, that it has abandoned the Greek dualism of form and matter, and thereby accepted the task of idealizing interests and objects from which Plato might have been excused for turning away. He who would further the philosophical work of the future must renounce once for all this questionable luxury of contempt, which in this, as in deed in almost all cases, is the mortal enemy of insight. For the speculative labor of the future is one that requires the patient consideration of* every partial truth, and the persistent effort to give it its due place in the whole, as well as a firm apprehension of the principles that underlie all truth. And the practical labor of the future is not merely by a shock to awaken men to the re ality of spiritual things, but to follow out the spiritual principle in its application to all the details of our physical, economical, and social condition, till we have seen how the life of each human be ing, and every part of that life, may be made worth living for itself. Plato speaks of an u old quarrel between the poet and the philosopher," which is to be reconciled only if poetry can be shown to be truth, or truth, in its highest aspect, to be poetry. In like manner, we may say of this almost equally " old quarrel" be tween the prophet and the man of science, that it can be healed only by carrying back our scattered knowledge of the facts and laws of nature to the principle upon which they rest, and, on the other hand, by developing that principle so as to fill all the details of knowledge with a significance which they cannot have in them selves, but only as seen sub specie ceternitatis.</page></plain_text>
