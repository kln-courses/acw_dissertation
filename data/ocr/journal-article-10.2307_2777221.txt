<plain_text><page sequence="1">People and Politics in Urban Society. Edited by Harlan Hahn. Urban Affairs Annual Reviews, vol. 6. Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage Publications, 1972. Pp. 635. $20.00. Scott Greer Northwestern University This weighty collection of articles, mostly empirical and quantitative in their data base, presents a severe problem (if not a trauma) for the reviewer. Many of the articles are practically monographs, beginning with the excellent 28-page introduction by Harlan Hahn. Hahn's main point is the importance of governmental structure as both facilitator and barrier to public policy making and public action. He sees that structure as inherently political: "Despite the importance of the 1030</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews subject, however, conventional accounts of urban issues often seem to treat local politics as an exercise in civic activity rather than as an essen- tial process for the resolution of conflicting demands and for the allevia- tion of municipal need" (p. 12) and "Solutions to metropolitian problems often may be found because of rather than in spite of politics. Moreover, the nature of local governance seems to raise some fundamental issues concerning the welfare of society generally" (p. 14). He attacks the personalistic, or anthropomorphizing, approach to local government. "By stressing an essentially anthropomorphic view of urban decision-making and by neglecting to emphasize the institutional con- straints and opportunities that mold political behavior, some observers seem to overlook one of the most salient and significant elements in city politics" (p. 18). In short, Hahn thinks like a sociologist, as do most of the contributors to this book. After Hahn's introduction, the book is divided into four sections: "The Expression of Public Sentiments," "Influencing Public Officials," "Local Responses to Public Demands," and "Emerging Issues of Urban Policy." In the first section, Peter K. Eisenger discusses the problem of rep- resentation and notes a rather clear division of labor between individual requests and group pressure for policy decision. He finds blacks much more dependent on the latter than whites. Sheldon Backman and Harlan Hahn then consider "Networks of Information and Influence in the Com- munity" and conclude that interpersonal communication is very impor- tant, uninstitutionalized, and dominated by the formal decision makers. Thomas F. Pettigrew considers the social attributes of areas and the tendency for their residents to express their sentiment by burning down the place. He finds that those area-based populations who feel relatively deprived are most apt to vote for Wallace and to oppose black mayoral candidates. Lewis Bowman, Dennis S. Ippolito, and Martin L. Levin test the Banfield-Wilson thesis that "public-regarding" voters are a type and will support broad measures of public improvement, while the self- interested will oppose it if it is not in their interest. They find no support for this thesis. Confidence in local government does make a difference in how blacks vote (e.g., in Atlanta) but not in the voting of whites. Finally, Jerome M. Clubb and Michael W. Traugott turn to "National Patterns of Referenda Voting: The 1968 Election." They found, through examin- ing many different referenda, that the voters on such issues are an elite by social class and that alienation and disaffection do not explain the outcome of the usual referendum. In the section "Influencing Public Officials," Michael Lipsky and Margaret Levi consider the possibilities of community organizations' influencing local government. In a shrewd analysis, they demonstrate the internal and external problems limiting the effects of such organizations. M. Kent Jennings and Harmon Zeigler, in a related article, turn to "In- terest Representation in School Governance," where they find that there is indeed a significant effect of some interest groups on the outcome of 1031</page><page sequence="3">American Journal of Sociology policy debates. In one of the more interesting articles, William P. Browne and Robert H. Salisbury consider urban lobbying, that is, the effect of the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and lesser organizations on federal decisions with respect to policy and execution of policy. They note the uses of these organizations for civic governmental heads: they increase professionalism, lend technical aid, socialize informa- tion of a comparative nature about cities-wages, hours, working con- ditions, prices, and the like-and they confer prestige on civic dignitaries. (Every vocation needs its version of the American Sociological Associa- tion, just as the market needs the Big Board.) In "Local Responses to Public Demands," Terry N. Clark tells us more about community power structure, dwelling on distinctions between centralized and decentralized structures, types of leadership, and types of issues as independent variables, with some useful advice on how to make it work. Bryan T. Downs and Lewis A. Friedman look at local decision- making and policy outcomes in a comparative framework, finding that, for 14 cities, fiscal outcomes were most likely to be the results of (a) inter- governmental aid and (b) the environment of the city. Howard Schuman and Barry Gruenberg examine dissatisfaction with city services and find that it varies by race and class of the subarea population; while they are chary of explaining this, they do note some relationship between dissatis- faction and propensity to riot. The final section deals with "Emerging Issues of Urban Policy," pri- marily with ethnic friction. Harold Rose contributes a cogent, empirical examination of types of black suburbs, contrasting those which are "colonies" with those which are "ghetto overspill." Among other virtues, this analysis debunks the naive interpretation of raw census data which sees substantial "movement of Blacks to the suburbs." David C. Perry and Joe R. Feagin remake William Foote Whyte's argument for the existence of "social structure in the slum," this time for black slums. Mario Barrera, Carlos Munoz, and Charles Ornelas discuss Mexican Americans, pointing out their overwhelmingly urban residence and their place as the number one disprivileged minority in five Southwestern states. They then proceed to use the metaphor of the "internal colony" to illuminate how colonization works, the prospects for decolonization (not good at the local level), and the future they hope for. Ronald 0. Loveridge discusses the problem of controlling the environment and underscores the conflict of political culture, governmental structure, and goal. He is not very optimistic about success. Finally, Matthew Holden, Jr., contributes an erudite article on the politics of urbanization which discusses the history of urban reform in this country and wryly examines the ignorance of history among current reformers. He is most concerned with problems of social integration in the city and how to handle them intellectually. All in all, this is a useful volume for the urban specialist. 1032</page></plain_text>
