<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROPHETIC AND MYSTIC EXPERIENCE: COMPARISON AND CONSEQUENCES1 ISIDOR THORNER 5430 Carlin Street Los Angeles, California 90016 BEFORE sketching the distinctive fea- tures of the two major varieties of religious experience, it may be useful to introduce the discussion with an abstract analysis.2 The subject of a religious experience believes not only that (1) his perceptions are extraordinary and constitute a sharp break with the world of everyday ex- perience, but that (2) they are far more important than ordinary perceptions and, unlike the latter, (3) their objective referents are not to be found in dis- crete aspects of the empirical world. The fourth criterion concerns the locus of this nonnaturalistic referent and sub- divides into two categories: (4a) One who has had a mystic experience (the unio mystica) is convinced that the non- 1 The reader should be aware that the writer's viewpoint is that of an agnostic West- erner inquiring into a subject heavily freighted with emotion and value judgments. I would like to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. M. Sydney Margolese (endocrinologist), Los Angeles; and to Drs. David Galin (Lab- oratory of Neurobiology), Paul D. MacLean (Chief of the section on Limbic Integration and Behavior), and Sanford M. Unger (Lab- oratory of Psychology), National Institutes of Health, who have been kind enough to call my attention to a number of useful references. 2 With minor modifications Walter Kauf- mann's exposition is followed.

(4b) The subject of the prophetic experience on the other hand understands the non- empirical referent to be wholly beyond nature and he has only been in com- munication with it. Moses and Buddha are selected as representative of these two varieties of religious experience because of their his- torical significance and the fact that from the legends about them it is possible to bring out in sharp paradigmatic contrast their preconditions, nature and consequences in coherent patterns. De- spite possible distortions the legends permit the extraction for each figure of a characteristic reaction to a crisis situation, a reaction congruent with respect -to action, ultimate meaning, values and orientation to man and his environment. Due to the nature of the approach and cultural diffusion his- torical mystics and prophets may not conform closely to their respective mod- els.4 While prophets may appear in cul- 3 That this may be empirically well-founded is suggested below. 4 For the contrasting characteristics see Friedrich Heiler, Prayer: A Study in the His- tory and Psychology of Religion, London, 1937; Oxford Press, esp. ch VI.

THE PROPHETIC EXPERIENCE Moses was reared as the adopted son of an Egyptian princess who unknow- ingly engaged the infant's mother as his nurse, thus ensuring that the child would retain a sense of Hebrew identity. As an adult he struck and killed an Egyptian supervisor whose beating of a Hebrew slave aroused his moral in- dignation and anger. Fear of discovery and punishment drove him to the des- ert where he joined a group of nomads, married, and fathered two sons. While guarding a flock his attention was at- tracted by a burning bush. Upon in- vestigation, he heard a divine voice is- suing from the flames commanding him, despite objections, to return to Egypt and undertake the dangerous task of leading his fellow Hebrews to freedom in a fertile land that was to be their own. To this injunction he reluctantly agreed. Such in brief is the account in Exodus. What does it mean in the context of a contemporary frame of reference? Moses' theophany is explicable as a manifestation of internal conflict be- tween affective bonds and ethical loy- alties involving different group mem- berships. Like all Old Testament proph- ets Moses was vitally interested in the welfare of his community and felt re- sponsible for it. He was not alienated cism by which he means, essentially, a fusion of the two ideal types. This derives from his citation of Christian mystics who have been influenced by scriptural prophetism. Compare J. M. Moore, Theories of Religious Experience, New York, 1938; Round Table Press, p. 156. Both Henri Bergson and Gershom Scholem tend to confuse the two types. See chapter three of The Two Sources of Morality and Religion and "Religious Authority and Mys- ticism," Commentary, 5 (Nov. 1964): 31-39, respectively. from or contemptuous of his fellows nor concerned solely with his own sal- vation, esoteric gnosis or communion with a deity.5 His obligation to his followers was that of a leader of semi- nomads interested in land and booty; that of later prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel for example, to a com- munity threatened with military disaster. In all cases the orientation was to others, not oneself. A disinterested other-orientation is a distinctive fea- ture of the prophetic model.6 Moses' invisible God had come to him as a moral challenge, not as a gratifying physiological experience or object of contemplation or intellectual curiosity. The emotional-ethical turmoil erupted suddenly and unexpectedly in the form of a visual and auditory hal- lucination, as well as a variety of psychic disorders among other prophets.8 The significance of the voice is two- fold: (1) The hearer postulates and con- fronts what is understood to be a super- natural transcendental anthropomorphic Speaker (offering a solution to a prob- 6 C.

The force- fulness no doubt represents the subject's own passionate character, as conceived for example in Michelangelo's Moses. The affective, cognitive and conative aspects of the personality are all in- volved in the prophetic experience. This "something other than man" is expe- rienced as having seized the prophet, transforming him into an active agent of his will to change the social order. The supramundane will that sanctified the prophet's mission thereby rendered illegitimate and devalued the traditional social order. The solution to the proph- et's psychic disturbances is what sup- ported him and drove him on against opposition; the prophets were neither popular nor popularity seekers. (2) Speech is the crucial mode of communication in the socialization of the individual and the formation of personality, while the words and structure of language recorded in the brain are of pervasive importance in the content and pro- cesses of thought.9 The prophet hears his message; he does not see it. The presence of a dia- logue involving ethical and political re- lationships is of fundamental significance for distinguishing the prophetic from the mystic experience.10 The message 9 See Gordon W. Allport, Pattern and Growth in Personality, New York, 1961; Holt, Rinehart and Winston, pp. 111-112; also Benjamin Lee Whori, Language, Thought and Reality, New York, 1956; Tech. Press of M. I. T. and John Wiley and Sons (the last paper in particular); and, also by the same publisher, L. S. Vygotsky, Language and Thought, 1961, pp. 58, 125; and J.S. Bruner, On Knowing, Cambridge, 1962; Belknap Press, passim. 10 This little noted distinction applies to the LSD-experience in its approximation to the mystic experience. See, e.g., G. Ray Jor- dan, Jr., "LSD and Mystic Experience," Ji. of Bible and Religion, 31 (1963): 114-123. is in the form of an oral dialogue, not writing, because it is a drama founded on the experience of child-parent re- lations in the socialization (ethicizing) process. In sum, the prophetic experience is one of profound moral-emotional crisis; its crux is a problem for which the message and task are a solution that has been created more or less subcon- sciously, risen to awareness, become the focus of action, and attributed to a divine personality. The latter is inter- preted here as a symbol for and par- ticipates in the authority and respect accorded the solution of a question oriented to the meaning and purpose of a life. The authority and respect tendered parental figures doubtless play a part here and these derive from the real and imputed capacity of parents to solve the child's problems. Thus God as a symbol for the solution of empirical problems beyond man's capac- ity and knowledge is a confession of helplessness and ignorance; the divine therefoi e has a dual orientation as the putative source of solutions to prob- lems of meaning and of empirical re- ference. It is the focus upon the ul- timate meaning of life and the universe that defines the religious orientation and its "seriousness." The inference is the importance of ethics (and rationality) in the devel- opment of religion since problems of meaning, purpose and value are sub- sequent to ethical feelings and ideas and their frustration. The problem posed by the necessity of cooperative action among self-conscious social primates no longer fully controlled by genetically transmitted mechanisms and behavior patterns was solved by the development, linked to the reward and punishment centers of the midbrain, of a capacity for a sense of obligation, of "ought- ness," of ethics in short, whereby homeo- static control could be exercised on intra- and interpersonal levels. The</page><page sequence="4">COMPARISON AND CONSEQUENCES 85 sense of injustice, therefore, is nor- mally more developed and readily arous- ed than the capacity to determine what is just." The psychosomatic consequences of norm violation testify to the in- corporation of mental constructs in the structure and functioning of the brain. The Word is indeed incarnated, the Logos made flesh. The prophetic experience is, like that of the artist and scientist, a creative one, expressive of the entire personali- ty's engagement, whereas, as will be shown, the mystic succeeds in tem- porarily dissociating himself in good part from his experience and major portions of his personality in the unio mystica.12 THE MYSTIC EXPERIENCE Prince Gautama Siddhartha who be- came the Buddha, The Enlightened One, married early and happily after having been reared in luxury and carefully protected from any contact with human misery. On the occasion that he was able to elude this solicitous surveillance he encountered a man suffering the infirmities of old age, another ravaged by disease, and, finally, a corpse, all three in sharp contrast to the serenity of a monk in meditation. This expe- rience at the age of twenty-nine and the realization that old age, sickness and death are inexorable consequences of life so shocked him that he aban- doned responsibility for country, parents, wife and child for some seven years of wandering, ascetic mortification, fast- n See C.

Bronowski, "The Creative Process," Scientific American, 199 (Sept., 1958): 59-65, p. 64. ing and meditation in search of the mean- ing of suffering-all to no avail. Par- enthetically, it should be noted that his problem was not the same as though related to the problem of evil; the latter is inherently an ethical one re- specting the discrepancy between merit and reward. Buddha put the normative "why?" to morally indifferent physio- logical processes; his solution recognized this by devaluing the ethical as merely transitory. The nature of his problem, therefore, excluded other-oriented emo- tion as an obstacle to thought-as well as a barrier, as will be shown, to mystic union. The contrast with Moses' mo- tivation and reaction could not be sharper, nor more significant. Finally, giving up all other means, he seated himself in the quiet shade of a tree absorbed in yogic meditation until he experienced the blissful ab- sorption in which he became aware of the knowledge of deliverance from the endless cycle of rebirth.13 It was only after a hard struggle that he de- cided against keeping his discovery to himself."4 If this were to be taken literally there would be small difference between mystic and prophetic experience as to the creation and dissemination of a message. But the legends suggest oth- erwise: After enjoying for forty-nine days immersion "in the stream of the bliss of the awakening," [The Awakened One] "understood that what he had experienced was beyond speech; all endeavor to talk about it would be vain. He determined, consequently, not to at- tempt to make it known." But a divinity implored him to change his mind because "some happy few" might learn to follow Buddha's path 13 Albert Schweitzer, Indian Thought and its Development, Boston, 1951; Beacon Press, p. 89. 14 Idem.</page><page sequence="5">86 PROPHETIC AND MYSTIC EXPERIENCE: through his teaching. "In contrast, in other words, to the other great teach- ers of mankind (Zarathustra. . : Con- fucius .. ; Jesus . . ) Gautama-is known properly as . .: the silent sage.: for in spite of all that has been said and taught about him, the Buddha remains the symbol of something beyond what can be said and thought."15 Of the content of his experience Buddha had nothing to say; he had no hallu- cination of a personage with a message purporting to solve his problem.16 His "message" had neither cognitive-ex- istential nor ethical content; he offered a practical recipe for the handful who wish and are able to follow his example rather than a vision or creed.17 Unlike Moses, Buddha was a repre- sentative of an intellectually sophisti- cated urban military stratum whose function and values were losing sig- nificance in the disintegration of a feudal society. He was an alienated intellectual seeking to understand a meaningless existence. It may not be wholly accidental that this was the upshot of his mystical experience.'8 Reflecting upon this he announced the Four Noble Truths: (1) All life is suffer- ing, (2) the cause of which is ignorant craving; (3) the suppression of suffer- ing can be achieved, and (4) the Eight- fold Path is the way to do it.'9 No 15 Heinrich Zimmern, Philosophies of India, N.

The process of "Yoga consists in the (intentional) stopping of the spon- taneous activities of the mind-stuff."' The mind is in constant agitation under 20 Zimmern, ibid., pp. 470-471. This con- ception, when institutionalized in a society, offers no basis for the indigenous development of science as it has arisen in the West.

Bronowski suggests (op. cit., pp. 61-62) that in contemplative periods and societies (the Western Middle Ages, Asia Minor and India) the anonymity of the craftsman prevailed while the sciences and the arts have flourished together in the Greek and Renaissance periods where action is valued and creation is regarded as personal. See Francis E. Dart on the significance of the absence among the Nepalese of the idea that nature is suceptible to rational understanding. "The Rub of Cultures," Foreign Affairs, Jan., 1963; p. 366. The 16th century mystic, Jacob Boehme, exemplifies the same devaluation of nonmystical interest: "If thou now suffereth thyself to be always looking into nature and the things of time, it will be impossible for thee ever to arrive at the unity which thou wishes for." Quoted by Howard P. Rome, "Mushrooms, Folklore, and Experimental Psychoses," in J. S. Gott- lieb and G. Tourney (eds.), Scientific Papers and Discussions, Detroit, 1959, Amer.

Common to all Indian methods and philosophies of self-absorption is the induction of mystical experience through the tech- nique of withdrawal of affect, will and attention from ego's extra- and intra- organismic environment and processes on the basis of years of ascetic train- ing designed to habituate the adept to the suppression of all emotional attach- ments." This is in diametric contrast to the engagement of these personal- ity aspects in the prophetic experience. The adept usually retires to a quiet shady isolated spot where he relaxes, immobile, with eyes wholly or partially closed and focused upon the base of the nose, in one of several prescribed seated positions. Inspiration, and expi- ration of the breath are regulated as to rhythm and quantity. Attention is withdrawn from the outside world and concentrated within upon the task of clearing the mind of all activity, "one-pointedness," ignoring anything crossing the mind until "absorption" occurs. The implications of this pos- ture and attitude for disregard of en- vironmental hazards, defenselessness, passivity, resignation and self-oriented asociality are obvious. There is ample evidence that the muscular relaxation achieved can affect the quantity of men- tal activity and also reduce anxiety.2" In the first stage there is consciousness of a distinction between the self as 22 Ibid., pp. 284-285. 23 Compare Franz Alexander, "Buddhistic Training as an Artificial Catatonia," Psycho- analytic Review, 18 (1931): 129-145, p. 132; and Zimmern, op. cit., pp. 293, 299, 443 ff. 24 See Edward W. Maupin, "Zen Buddhism: A Psychological Review," Ji. of Consulting Psychology, 26 (1962): 362-378, p. 373. observer and an infrapersonal divine entity that is observed, while the su- preme ecstasy of a beatific vision is enjoyed. In the ultimate stage this distinction and the ecstasy are left behind so that there is awareness only of a "fusion of knower and known." It is in this state that the yogi is devoid of all attachments, enlightened in ab- solute awareness. There is in this af- fectless and cognitionless condition a conviction of direct and complete com- prehension of the significance and in- terrelatedness of the universe com- bined with the belief that the deeply buried "I" of the adept is identical with and rejoins the eternal divine force that is the unchanging reality, beyond good and evil, beneath the transient diversity of all things.25 This reality is beyond good and evil for two reasons: (1) the moral and emotional neutrality preconditioning its apprehension, and (2) the referent if it has any empirical basis at all is, ac- cording to the speculation advanced here, the electrochemical firing pat- terns of the brain. This "contact with reality" is the state achieved by Bud- dha. It would seem unlikely that "knowledge" is either acquired or im- parted in this condition if by it con- ceptual propositions are meant.26 The mystic's experience is ineffable not only because no physiological experience can be adequately described and conveyed 25 Compare Alan W. Watts, The Way of Zen, N. Y., 1958; Pantheon, pp. 18 fi. The hallucinatory state has been the source of the world's mythologies and it was, no doubt, accidentally that the ultimate stage was stumb- led upon at least as early as 2500 B. C. (witnessed by the yoga-postured figurines at Mohenjo- daro). See Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology, N. Y., 1959; Viking, pp. 435-437. 26 Compare the serenity or bland vacancy of the Buddha's portrayal with, e.g., the Moses of Michelangelo or Rodin's Thinker.</page><page sequence="7">88 PROPHETIC AND MYSTIC EXPERIENCE: to others who have not undergone it themselves but because the "content" of the mind is bypassed in this state of consciousness. Another version of the progression toward Nirvana is presented by Alex- ander27 as follows: (1) External and internal perceptions are withdrawn and concentrated upon a single theme, de- valuing the world and the body, (2) disgust for the body in the preceding stage is overcome, with a narcissistic regression of libido to self-love accom- panied by a feeling of consummate voluptuousness throughout the body, likened by Buddha to immersion in a pool of water.28 This is the "oceanic feeling" and accounts for the comparison of the mystic to a vessel filled by a divine force. The voluntary passivity of the mystic "vessel" contrasts sharply with the involuntarily produced dynarn- ism of the prophetic "tool of God." There is no anthropomorphic person- ality with whom a dialogue is con- ducted, no authority figure providing cognitive solutions and tasks; only a wavelike sequence of pleasurable sensa- tions that the present writer suggests may be explained as due to electrical discharges impinging upon the reward centers in the midbrain. Something comparable but much weaker may be experienced by the subject of E. Ja- cobson's progressive relaxation tech- nique as well as the inductee descend- ing into hypnosis since both relaxation 27 Op. cit. 28 This recalls William James' discussion (in The Varieties of Religious Experience, N. Y.. 1936; Modern Library, pp. 242-253) of spon- taneous conversion experiences resembling the mystic union, referring to waves of liquid love, like a wave of electricity through the body. Marghanita Laski's work on ecstasy is chiefly concerned with involuntary mystic experience, without considering the distinctive features of prophetic experience. and autohypnosis are elements in yoga.29 The second stage is followed by (3) a state of detumescence with diminution of the pleasure feeling to one of apathy, culminating in (4) a state of complete mental emptiness and uniformity (Nir- vana). This might be expected conse- quent upon the temporary circumven- tion of the linguistic categories of dis- crimination and classification of per- ceptions;30 time and space are transcen- ded as eternity is experienced. The physical aspects of this process include immobility, scarcely perceptible breathing, limitation of metabolism and trance. The clinical symptoms of the latter as reported by a Western ob- server3' include: slow breathing that sometimes stops altogether, rigid limbs falling into haphazard positions, eyes closed, rhythmic body surges in unison with breathing, and apparently an all- pervading bliss. In the last stage prior to mystic union there are "inner lights," among the latter a brilliant "white light" which seems to wipe the mind completely blank.32 It would be difficult to interpret this as referring to meaningful sentences or scenes, bea- tific or otherwise. In an experiment with a yoga adept in trance the psychogalvanic reflex was consistently low and the EEG (elcctroencephalograph) readings nor- mal, indicating that the subject was alert and relaxed, not asleep, while buried in a pit for from two to nine hours. The lesser degree of physiological functioning was registered by a con- siderable decrease in the rate of me- 29 See Maupin, op. cit., pp. 372-376. 30 See Allport's discussion of mental set and "proception," ch. 11, op. cit.; and Martin Scheerer, "Problem-Solving," Scientific Amer- ican, 208 (April 1963): 118 ff., for the obstacles raised by unconscious premises. 31 Arthur Koestler, The Lotus and the Robot, N. Y., 1961; Macmillan, pp. 75-76. 32 Idem. pp. 95-100.</page><page sequence="8">COMPARISON AND CONSEQUENCES 89 tabolism.33 Koestler reports a large measure of agreement among various sources as to the mystic union: physio- logical "hibernation," consciousness with- out content other than itself, a state of bliss preceded by a shapeless radiance that blanks out the mind, and a return from the experience without any pos- itive recollections.34 Although some aspects of the mystic experience seem to resemble reported experiences with LSD-25, mescaline, psi- locybin, and some of the results of sensory deprivation experiments,35 several quali- fications are in order. One caution in comparing these phenomena concerns the highly disciplined personality of the adept for whom isolation does not constitute a stressful situation, in con- trast to many patients and experiment- al subjects whose social setting, predi- lections and problems influence the con- tent of the experience. Although the adept may have hallucinations the drugs also produce distorted perceptions of real objects. In addition the Indian mystic ignores as incidental the hal- lucinations which the Christian mystic may seek. Suggestive of the hallucinatory mys- tic state is the sensory isolation in- vestigations' evidence that the "primary 33 Idem, pp. 118-120.

In contrast to both the mystic and these experimental subjects, however, the par- taker of LSD can move about, eat and converse so that this alerting system remains in operation. In view of this it would not seem inherently implausible to find Jordan reporting of LSD experience (p. 116) that "Often, new meanings in the form of valid insights into one's life situ- ation emerge." Yet his comment about four kinds of self-imagery change as "not originally [in the experience itself] discoveries of thought." (p. 118) leaves the reader in doubt-as does his dis- cussion of "significance" (in footnote nine), since the hallucinated objects do not possess a symbol-referent kind of meaning. Rather, their "significance" resides in the vivid reality of the objects per se. Also, and again to the extent this state of awareness approximates the mystic experience as here defined, the description of the climactic stage mentions nothing in the way of per- sonality attributes with reference to what the subjects call God, nor, further, is there any suggestion of a dialogue of any kind. Among the invariant drug reactions only theextraordinary quality of the visual hallucinations is cited in Unger's review article (p. 113). No mention is made of auditory hallucina- tions involving ethical dialogue. This same author quotes (p. 123) William James as to the "inarticulate" nature of the significance of the illuminations and revelations of what he calls "the transport." In summary, the yogi's technique brings about a drastic reduction of afferent stimuli to the cortex, affecting a radical interference with the most primitive types of perception and, con- sequently, of large areas of ego function-</page><page sequence="9">90 PROPHETIC AND MYSTIC EXPERIENCE: ing. A successful effort is made to clear away all symbols mediating be- tween a "person" and his experience; ego boundaries vanish as one becomes one with the non-self." And since sym- bols and concepts are a socially ac- quired linguistic phenomenon it follows that in the unio mystica the entire con- tent and structure of language-me- diated experience registered in the brain cells and their electrochemical discharge patterns are bypassed. If, therefore, by "insight" is meant a sudden con- ceptual comprehension of hitherto un- perceived relationships among the data of experience, then this kind of insight is lacking in mysticism: the mystic's mind in trance is blank. Buddhist iconography, based on yoga experience, has three stages of rebirth: (1) the world of desires, (2) the world of form beyond desires, and (3) the world without form.37 As introvert ab- sorption deepens stages two and three are reached. It is suggested that stage one is represented by objects of desire in the form of symbols registered in the cortex; the second corresponds to linguistic and thought structure (modes of discrimination and classification as well as syntax and grammar) in terms of habitual patterns of cortical firing; and the third is the state in which cortical discharges occur in "dataless" sequences. The cortex is operating as a "computer mechanism" without rules and "input" of "information bits."38 It is in this final stage (Nirvana) that knower and known, consciousness and being conscious fuse, with cortical fir- ing "experiencing" itself.39 It is at this " Albert Stunkard, "Some Interpersonal Aspects of an Oriental Religion," Psychiatry, 14 (1951): 419-431. 37 Zimmern, op. cit., p. 143. 38 See Karl H. Pribram, "The New Neurology: Memory, Novelty, Thought and Choice," in Gilbert H. Glaser (ed.), EEG and Behavior, N. Y., 1963; Basic Books, pp. 165-166. point that the cortex's unique function of problem solving through "ordering" "making sense of," "comprehending" the creature's environment is reflected in the unreasoned conviction that the uni- verse is a necessarily interrelated (as are the neurons) and meaningful whole. It is to this that the Vedanta "Thou art That" refers, in contrast to Buber's anthropomorphic "I-Thou." This state of awareness, despite its inhibition of thought processes, cannot be compared with regression to a neonatal period4O when the cortical neurons have not yet maturated and comprehension and awareness are barely if at all recognizable. This highly valued state is, necessar- ily, transitory. To retain the "timeless eternity" of Nirvana permanently re- quires the cessation of disturbing phys- iological and cerebral processes; that is, death during the final stage. Buddha's conclusion that the metaphysically mean- ingless will to live is the reason for the senseless suffering in life (and for in- dividuality also) and the hindrance to the redeeming illumination leading to divine tranquility4l is the conceptual for- mulation of the adept's process of withdrawal to the infrapersonality level. It is precisely his return short of death that legend purports to explain as due to a wholly uncharacteristic decision to 39 Compare Whorf, op. cit., pp. 241 ff. 40 Max Hayman, "Science, Mysticism and Psychopharmacology," California Medicine, 101 (Oct. 1964): 266-271. The "timeless etern- ity of pure being" (Nirvana) would result from interfering with the functioning of a midbrain component if Turner McLardy's hypothesis should be correct.

He did not have and could not have had a message of any kind. His solu- tion to the problem of the meaning of the three ills flesh is heir to was the presentation of a behavioral model to be imitated and an invitation to vir- tuosi to proceed upon the arduous path to a psychophysiological experience, not a conceptual discovery. Buddha's ethic and philosophy are elaborations facil- itating, evaluating and rationalizing his experience and its psychological con- sequences; hence Heiler's remark about Sankara's and Eckhart's philosophical monism being a metaphysical inter- pretation of the mystic's ecstatic ex- perience.42 An analogous comment ap- plies to the prophetic experience. Alexander has seen, as have Schweit- zer and Weber, the inconsistency of Buddha's departure from his own teach- ing in denying himself Nirvana: "The goal of absorption, Nirvana, is a com- pletely asocial condition and it is dif- ficult to combine with ethical precepts.""i It is possible, however, to offer a suggestion accounting for the contra- diction by a closer examination of the mystic union, its prerequisites and con- sequences. Although the mystic's seren- ity and peace of mind, founded on long years of training in impersonality and moral neutrality, inhibit such negative states as anxiety, fear, anger, etc., the former are compatible with a mild degree of socially derived and directed affect oriented toward no particular object. In trance the "waves of liquid love" stage immediately precedes the col- lapse of ego boundaries and the conviction that the cosmos is an interrelated whole immanent with divinity. The tension, it is suggested, between the psycholog- ically necessary asociality and imper- sonality and the autoeroticism prior to the moment of Enlightenment is trans- 42 Compare Heiler, op. cit., p. 169. 43 Op. cit., pp. 144-145. muted into the individually indifferent but all-inclusive "objectless" compassion of "acosmic love."" It is doubtful, how- ever, whether this is to be identified with the attitudes uniting those who have participated in the communal sharing of the sacred mushroom.45 Thus Buddha's perhaps idiosyncratic kindliness and doc- trinally unorthodox compassion for man- kind's salvation4" and his understanding of charity as liberality to monks47 can be understood as psychologically con- gruent. On the other hand, if the adept should be subject to a certain degree of neg- ative affect, the blissful stage of En- lightenment might be jeopardized or lost if the punishment mechanism con- tiguous to the reward areas in the mid- brain is triggered. Thus both the mys- tic's "dark night of the soul," which may be what Rudolf Otto (The Idea of the Holy) means by the mysterium tremendum aspect of the religious ex- perience, and its mysterium fascinosum quality might be accounted for neuro- physiologically.48 4" See Max Weber, (in Parsons, et al.) 2: 1123; and The Religion of India, pp. 208-209, 212, 228-229. 45 H.

The substance of Buddha's reflection upon the conditions leading to Nir- vana is the advocacy of a disciplined detachment from life's goals, values and standards. The recommended attitude is one of affective and moral neutrality, since passion (including ethical passion) is the root of the senseless striving for the delusive ephemeralities of the world of action which interfere with the serene equanimity introductory to and constitutive of the mystic union, itself, ironically, a most transitory phe- nomenon. This striving is senseless be- cause Buddha had penetrated beneath the level of meaning, below the level on which mankind attempts to frame an answer to the question addressed to life: To what end? He rejects all answers as illusory. In Nirvana the meaningless reality is indeed, if the proffered interpretation is valid, the meaningless basic energy-matter that, in its "playfulness" as a Buddhist text has it, constitutes the endless mani- festations of the universe. Buddha, the religious teacher, rejected as illusory religion's core concern: life's ultimate meaning; in effect he valued one thing alone: a purely psychophysiological ex- perience. By plunging beneath the sociocultural level of interpersonal relations and its counterpart in the personality to the underlying electrochemical firing pat- terns of the brain, Buddha avoided the Mean Urinary 17 - Hydroxycorticosteroid Ex- cretion Rates," Psychosomatic Medicine, 26 (Sept.-Oct. 1964): 576-591. The affectless mystic state could very well be associated with a low level of adrenal cortex functioning. fallacy of imputing teleological and other human characteristics to impersonal cos- mic processes. On the other hand and by the same token, because he recog- nized that individual human beings create and confer through their culture meaning and significance upon "the meaningless infinity of the world proc- ess,"49 Buddha rejected as transitory and without worth the many-splendored man- sions of the mind in which man lives and moves and has his being. "The nature and destiny of man," which encompass the freedom to create ideas and the responsibility for their consequences, are part of the unreality of the world of Maya (illusion). The result is a certain indifference: Accept the world as it is and one's position in it without expecting much, carry out traditional duties with emo- tional detachment. Although this im- personality, ideally, characterized the Puritan, he went about revolutionizing the social order as a "tool of God" sup- ported by an ethic that in almost every important characteristic was the antithesis of the mystic's. Having "seen through" life it may be lived and enjoyed as a mere game, not taking it seriously and pro- tected from its seductions by that af- fective and moral neutrality which, in- stitutionalized in their roles, protects the nurse and physician from their patients.50 Since the immanent imper- 49 For Weber's comparable conclusion see H.

In this perspective neither tragedy and its catharsis nor history52 finds a place. No fulcrum for ethical effort is provided. To repeat, the latter requires passion and passion frus- trates mystic union; while the absence of passion precludes more than the passive exhibition of a way of life for the disenchanted few who seek imme- diate salvation, simultaneously afford- ing the laity the merit of supporting them. The prophetic orientation to man, nature and time has had a pervasive influence upon Western value orienta- tions as indeed the mystical has had upon those of the Orient.53 Man is con- ceived to be a significant actor on the from the tyrannies of ordinary perception and conscience which motivates what Roger Caillois classifies as vertigo games.

Although Robert Oppenheimer's emi- nence as a physicist lends no weight to his views in other fields, the obser- vations of a widely experienced, richly endowed and highly cultivated intel- lect may not be neglected. He finds in the European tradition but not in those of China and India two major traits of current significance: (1) a sense of responsibility to the present and future of human history manifested in the Old Testament and the New which "is probably a decisive reason for the growth of ... the modern world of science." And to the question why no such development occurred in China, India or the Mediterranean world of antiquity, Oppenheimer replies (2) "I believe that the idea of the improvement of human life on earth provided the air for the great fires of science."" It seems to the present writer that both these traits, responsibility for his- tory and the improvement of human life, ultimately derive from the Old Testament prophets, whereas no sim- ilar influence was able to make itself felt once mysticism had established itself in India and the Orient. The inner ideational opposition of mysticism to the scientific urge to un- derstand the phenomenal world was al- luded to above,65 without attempting to elaborate on the prophetic Weltan- schauung in this area. The Old Tes- tament genesis myth expresses the no- tion of man's dominion over nature but the Hebrew genius was for ethics not the comprehension of nature's law. The unique confluence that led to 4 "The Added Cubit," Encounter, (Aug. 1963): 44-47, p. 45. These differences appear in mythology also. See Cambell, 1962, op- cit., p. 130. " Footnote 20.</page><page sequence="13">94 PROPHETIC AND MYSTIC EXPERIENCE: Western science brought to a synthesis the irresistible energy of Jehovah and the Greek conception of a rational un- derstanding of nature to form, during the Middle Ages, the basic assumption of science: the phenomenal world is subject to a natural, comprehensible order.56 To this conception the tradi- tion of Roman practicality in everyday affairs contributed the laboratory ex- periment in the artisan workshops of the Italian Renaissance. But after science had been turned to the task of master- ing nature the latent ethical dynamism of the West deriving from prophetic religion was prepared to take socially responsible humanitarian advantage of the resources created by the Industrial Revolution-as Oppenheimer may be interpreted to have implied. On the other hand, mysticism with its foundation in affective and moral neutrality supports the traditional social order out of a basic indifference to the things of this world. Schweitzer cites Vivekananda's confession that India is merciless to the wretched.57 Consonant with mysticism's value orientation is Dart's observation that the people of the underdeveloped countries want "to find and somehow adopt the concepts of equal justice, equal dignity, equal cos- mic importance for all-concepts that the Westerner enjoys but has been unable to share . . " despite the fact that Asian religion, unlike Christianity " A. N. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas. The conception of a personal ruler of the universe (which, together with the idea of a universal moral order, may be interpreted as the domestication of the cosmos to human needs) facilitates the logical error of confusing the intelligible with the intelligent; nature is rendered intelligible by man's intelligence but does not thereby become intelligent. 7 Op. cit., p. 255.

"which is viewed with deep distrust," "offers no strong motivation toward social change. "58 The distinctive characteristic of the two varieties of religious experience are epitomized by Koestler who concludes in the basis of personal experience that "moral indignation" and "oceanic feel- ing" phenomena are "opposite in every respect," physiologically and psychol- ogically, in intellectual outlook and social attitudes.59 One further comment on this point: The combination of mysticism's self-oriented moral and emo- tional neutrality with its comprehension of the necessary interrelatedness of the cosmos conduces not only to tradi- tionalism but to a peace of mind that has proved congruent with the doctrine of ahimsa (non-violence), the code of the Samurai,60 and with Nazism on the part of a Western practitioner of Zen,6' which offers the alluring promise of relief for the malaise of a tension-ridden West-albeit, perhaps, at the risk of jeopardizing the prophetic contribution to its culture.62 It was his prophetically-derived pas- sion for social justice and capacity for moral indignation which motivated Marx's break with Hegelian thought when he realized "that Hegel's system of total comprehension leads to the re- conciliation of the mind with the world as it is . . [instead of revolutionizing it],"63-an intellectual reconciliation that O8 op. cit., p. 362. 69 Marghanita Laski, op. cit., pp. 405-406. 60 Max Weber, The Religion of India, p. 278: D. T.

This consequence, how- ever, like the dictum "To understand all is to forgive all," rests upon a form of the pathetic fallacy in that evaluative judgment is confused with causal un- derstanding-as in "scientific socialism" and Critical Study, N.

Whether the coupling of Eastern and Western conceptions will result in social and cultural efflorescence or sterility (evaluative terms !) only the future will reveal, a future determined in part by the awesome consequences of the (sci- entific) ideas Western man has created.

This work confirms the radical opposition between the two states of consciousness summarized here. See also, for the conflicting theological implications, Jordan's exposition (op. cit., p. 121) of the two varieties of what he classifies "type four" mystic experience. 65 The sociological concepts of self- and other- orientation are not synonymous with what Arthur Koestler styles the self-asserting and self-transcending emotions, rooted in the sym- pathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems respectively. Paradoxically, the mystic's self- transcendence is self-oriented, while the proph- et's assertiveness is on behalf of others. (The Act of Creation, New York, 1964; Macmillan).</page></plain_text>
