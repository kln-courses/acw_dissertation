Chromosome Aberrations in Rela- tion to Radiation Dose following Partial-Body Exposures in Three Populations. Radiat. Res. 123, 93-101 (1990). Structural chromosome aberrations were evaluated in periph- eral blood samples obtained from three populations exposed to partial-body irradiation. These included 143 persons who re- ceived radiotherapy for enlarged thymus glands during infancy and 50 sibling controls; 79 persons irradiated for enlarged ton- sils and 81 persons surgically treated for the same condition dur- ing childhood; and 77 women frequently exposed as young adults to fluoroscopic chest X rays during lung collapse treat- ment for tuberculosis (TB) and 66 women of similar ages treated for TB with other therapies. Radiation exposures occurred 30 and more years before blood was drawn. Doses to active bone marrow averaged over the entire body were 21, 6, and 14 cGy for the exposed thymic, tonsil, and TB subjects, respectively. Two hundred metaphases were scored for each subject, and the fre- quencies of symmetrical (stable) and asymmetrical (unstable) chromosome aberrations were quantified in 97,200 metaphases. Cells with stable aberrations were detected with greater fre- quency in the irradiated subjects compared with nonirradiated subjects in all three populations, and an overall test for an associ- ation between stable aberrations and partial-body ionizing radia- tion was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). We found no evidence that radiation-induced aberrations varied by age at exposure. These data show that exposure of children or young adults to partial-body fractionated radiation can result in detectable in- creased frequencies of stable chromosome aberrations in circu- lating lymphocytes 30 years later, and that these aberrations ap- pear to be informative as biological markers of population exposure. ? 1990 Academic Press, Inc. 1 To whom reprint requests should be addressed at Radiation Epidemi- ology Branch, EPN 408, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892. 2 Current address: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892. 93 Ionizing radiation causes structural chromosome dam- age in somatic cells that can be detected many years later in the circulating lymphocytes of humans. Dose-related in- creases in chromosome aberrations induced by whole-body or partial-body irradiation 30 years and more after exposure have been reported for several irradiated populations (1-6). The value of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations as a biological indicator of dose several decades after exposure, however, is not clear for populations receiving repeated, fractionated exposures to only portions of their bodies (7). Further, it is not known to what extent long-term survival of irradiated lymphocytes or propagation of lymphocyte progenitors depends upon age at irradiation. To investigate these issues, we conducted cytogenetic evaluations of per- sons who received partial-body exposure to radiation over 30 years ago to evaluate the usefulness of chromosome ab- errations as a biologic dosimeter, to relate the number of aberrations to dose, and to assess the influence of age at irra- diation on aberration frequency. In this report, we present cytogenetic results from three populations exposed to radia- tion because of enlarged thymus gland, enlarged tonsils, or, in the case of tuberculosis (TB), repeated fluoroscopic ex- amination. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Populations Study subjects were recruited from three cohorts under epidemiologic study for the occurrence of radiation-induced cancer. Each cohort was composed of irradiated and nonirradiated subjects. Excess cancers and dose-response relationships have been reported in each of the exposed populations. For all three populations, radiation exposure occurred be- tween 30 and 40 years prior to the evaluation of chromosome aberrations. Participation in the present study was contingent upon subjects having never undergone diagnostic radiation procedures, excluding dental and chest X rays, or having a diagnosis of cancer.

Stovall, personal communication). Thymic Cohort Subjects were selected from a cohort of 2856 persons treated during in- fancy with radiotherapy for enlarged thymus gland, between 1926 and 1957. This cohort has been under continuous epidemiologic surveillance to assess the risk of radiation-induced tumors. Nontreated siblings (n = 5053) have served as a comparison group (8-12). Irradiated and control subjects who were living in the Rochester, New York area in 1984 were eligible to enroll in a laboratory evaluation of immunologic and thyroid function and cytogenetic studies. The cohort was stratified into four expo- sure groups (0, 1-100 R, 101-200 R, and &gt;200 R), and subjects were ran- domly selected within strata to achieve approximately equal representation from each group and to obtain a sample size of 200 subjects. The results of the immunologic and thyroid function components of the study have been reported elsewhere (13, 14). Potential participants were contacted by telephone, and 220 (45%) of the 490 irradiated subjects and 95 (53%) of their 179 siblings met eligibility requirements. One hundred fifty-one (69%) of the eligible irradiated subjects and 51 (54%) of the eligible siblings consented to participate, and their blood samples were obtained between June and December 1984. Successful cultures were obtained for 143 irradi- ated subjects and 50 siblings. Subjects were, on average, 37 years of age at blood drawing. Typically, irradiated subjects received one or two treatments to the thy- mus gland, although some infants were given multiple treatments over the course of a few weeks. Beam quality varied from 80 kVp up to 250 kVp, and the field size also varied (3 X 5 cm, 6 X 8 cm, and 10 X 10 cm). Approx- imately 75% of the infants were treated anteriorly, 3% posteriorly, and the remainder with a combination of both approaches (10). The radiation ex- posure ranged from about 25 to 1250 R in air with a mean exposure of 225 R (10). Among irradiated subjects from whom blood specimens had been collected, the mean exposure was 210 R, and very few subjects received more than 400 R. Air dose for each irradiated subject was provided by one of the authors (N.G.H.), and a multiplicative correction factor of 0.10 was applied to estimate bone marrow dose averaged over the entire body (M. Stovall, personal communication). Enlarged Tonsils A cohort of 3089 persons treated during childhood (under 18 years of age) with either surgery (n = 1499) or radiation (n = 1590) for lymphoid hyperplasia (primarily enlarged tonsils) between 1938 and 1969 at one hos- pital in Massachusetts were under study for the occurrence of radiation- induced head and neck tumors (15). The average age at treatment for these subjects was 7 years. Subjects who responded to a mail questionnaire in 1980-81 and who were still residing in the Boston area (n = 1899) were offered a free clinical head and neck examination. Blood was drawn also for thyroid hormone concentrations and cytogenetic evaluation from con- senting subjects. Fifty-nine percent (n = 602) of the irradiated and 52% (n = 457) of the surgically treated subjects underwent head and neck exami- nations; the results have been reported elsewhere (15). Initially only sub- jects who had been treated with at least 800 R to their tonsils were eligible from the irradiated group for cytogenetic evaluation. We later included all of the irradiated subjects, regardless of dose, because a substantial propor- tion of subjects reported previous diagnostic radiation exposures and had to be excluded. Blood was drawn between April 1982 and October 1983 from 166 subjects. Successful cultures were obtained from 79 of the 597 irradiated and 81 of the 445 nonirradiated subjects who were eligible for the chromosome component of the study. Irradiated subjects were slightly older than nonirradiated subjects at blood drawing, 37 and 35 years, re- spectively. For the irradiated subjects, average bone marrow dose was determined using data from their original radiotherapy records, and measurements were made on an anthropomorphic phantom the size of a 6-year-old child. Correction factors were applied for other ages at treatment, and these were based on water phantom measurements. The methods used to calculate average bone marrow dose following partial-body exposures have been de- scribed previously (16). The children typically received 800 R delivered over 2 weeks from two treatments of 200 R, 250 kVp X rays, to each of two fields (6 X 8 cm, 5 X 7 cm, or 6 X 7 cm) which centered on the naso- pharynx (15, 17). Bone marrow dose was calculated based upon the distri- bution of active bone marrow, adjusted for the child's age at irradiation (18). The average bone marrow dose from a typical treatment for a 6-year- old child was estimated to be 6-8 cGy per 1000 cGy given dose (M. Stovall, personal communication). Tuberculosis Cohort Former TB patients were enrolled from a cohort of 1764 women who had received multiple low-dose chest fluoroscopies during air collapse ther- apy or other treatments including bed rest. All patients were discharged from one of two Massachusetts sanitaria between 1930 and 1954 (19, 20). Subjects less than 30 years of age at time of TB diagnosis (average age 20 years) and living in the Boston area as of December 1981, were contacted to undergo a clinical examination for detection of thyroid abnormalities and for cytogenetic evaluation. Results of the thyroid screening study have 94</page><page sequence="3">CHROMOSOME BREAKS AFTER IRRADIATION been reported (21). For this population, women who had ever had a thyroid scan (eight exposed and four nonexposed subjects) were permitted to par- ticipate to avoid a bias of underascertainment of thyroid abnormalities for the thyroid screening component of the study. Of the 675 women contacted for clinical evaluation, 229 (34%) refused to participate, 244 (36%) were ineligible due to radioisotope exposure, 39 (5.8%) reported other problems such as illness, and 163 (24%) consented. Blood samples were collected between November 1983 and June 1984 from 154 women, and successful cultures were obtained from 77 exposed and 66 nonexposed women. The average age of these women at time of blood drawing was 62 years for irradiated and 58 years for nonirradiated subjects. Subjects who received air collapse therapy for TB were exposed to re- peated low-energy (70-85 kVp) and relatively low doses during fluoros- copy over a 3-year period (average, 101 examinations). Based on data col- lected from medical records, interviews with physicians who performed these examinations, and measurements made on the machines in use at the time, doses to several organs in the body had been estimated for each subject (22). The methods used to reconstruct doses were based on several parameters, including the energy of the beam and whether or not the sub- ject was facing the fluoroscopic tube. The mean dose to the total bone marrow was estimated to be 14 cGy and ranged from 1 to 59 cGy. Air dose to the subjects tended to be quite high, about 1200 cGy, in part because the beam energy used for the fluoroscopic procedures was so low and be- cause the average time per fluoroscopy was relatively high, 15 s. Cytogenetic Methods For each culture date, heparinized venous blood samples were collected from several control and irradiated subjects (usually 6-14 persons). Sam- ples were assigned code numbers and were shipped in chilled styrofoam containers to the radiation cytogenetics laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennes- see, via overnight express carriers. A series of lymphocyte cultures was initi- ated for each subject. For each culture approximately I ml of cell-rich plasma collected from gravity-sedimented whole blood was inoculated into 9 ml of complete culture medium (83% RPMI media [GIBCO], 15% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [GIBCO], 1% antibiotic solution [GIBCO], and 1% reconstituted phytohemagglutinin [PHA; Burroughs- Wellcome]). Replicate cultures were initiated in the same medium supple- mented with 30 ,Mbromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Calbiochem). After incu- bation at 37?C for 45 h, colchicine was added to each culture to arrest mitoses, and 3 h later all cultures were harvested and slides prepared by standard procedures. To achieve differentiation of chromatids in cultures supplemented with BrdU, slides were stained by a previously described modification (23) of the fluorescence-plus-Giemsa (FPG) technique (24). Criteria for Scoring Chromosome Aberrations Mitotic indices were determined in cultures with and without BrdU by recording the number of mitoses per 1000 consecutive nucleated elements. The number of metaphases in their second or later in vitro division was estimated by counting 100 consecutive differentiated metaphases from BrdU-substituted cultures. Since lymphocytes containing unstable aberrations are at risk for mitotic death (25-29), several authors have recommended that scoring aberrations in cultured lymphocytes from irradiated persons should be restricted to first-division metaphases from cells with BrdU substitution stained by the FPG technique. In this series of cultures we elected to score chromosome aberrations on slides that were stained by routine Giemsa methods since our experience has shown that the morphology of chromosomes tends to be superior on slide preparations that have not been subjected to FPG differentiation techniques. The percentages of metaphases in their second in vitro division in these 48-h cultures varied by study population, and averaged 18% in prepara- tions from both nonexposed and exposed thymus patients, 11% in cultures from women in the TB cohort, and 3% in cultures from the tonsil patients. To determine whether the presence of increased numbers of second-divi- sion metaphases in cultures initiated from the thymus and TB patients had a measurable impact on our estimates of asymmetrical aberration fre- quencies in either the exposed or nonexposed persons, we tested for regres- sion of asymmetrical aberrations ascertained from Giemsa-stained slides on the frequency of second-division mitoses in replicate samples of cells with BrdU substitution from each individual patient. [For discussion of approach, see Ref. (30.)] In no instance did we observe a significant de- crease in the proportions of metaphases having ring or dicentric chromo- somes as a function of proportion of second-division metaphases present in lymphocyte cultures scored for aberrations. Earlier, Bender et al. (30) reported a mean frequency of second and later mitoses of about 7% in 48-h lymphocyte cultures from 353 healthy employees at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and statistical analyses verified that the presence of that small percentage of second mitoses had no effect on ascertainment of spontane- ous aberration frequencies. Four scorers were involved in collection of cytogenetic data from the various cohorts, and they were blind to the exposure status of subjects. When possible, 200 metaphases having centromere counts of 46 + 1 from each culture were subjected to detailed microscopic evaluations to ascer- tain the frequencies of all types of symmetrical (i.e., "stable") and asym- metrical (i.e., "unstable") chromosome aberrations (4, 6). Briefly, all meta- phases were first counted and then analyzed systematically under the mi- croscope by pairing chromosomes 1, 2, 3, and 16, and by counting each member of the B, D, E, F, and G chromosome groups. In any culture, two or more metaphases having morphologically indistinguishable stable aberrations were considered to be clonal in origin, and they were counted as single aberrant cells in all statistical analyses. All metaphases having any type of unstable aberration or any suspected stable aberration were photographed and karyotyped for verification of the aberration. One of the authors (L.G.L.), who was also unaware of the subjects' exposure status, reviewed and made final decisions regarding abnormalities present and all karyotypes prepared by each of the four observers. The methods that we used for cytogenetic evaluations in these cohorts of patients were similar to those used in the extensive evaluations of persistent radiation-induced chromosome aberrations in cultured lymphocytes of the A-bomb survivors (31), and identical to the approach we employed in our earlier cytogenetic evaluations in women previously irradiated for cervical cancer (6). In each of these studies, scoring of chromosome aberrations was performed without the use of more labor-intensive banding techniques. However, it should be noted that comparisons of the two methods have demonstrated that approximately 80% of the damaged metaphases and 76% of the stable aberrations identified by banding procedures can be as- certained using such detailed and systematic evaluations of conventionally stained slides (32-34). Statistical Methods Statistical analyses were performed for aberration types known to be in- duced by ionizing radiation, including stable (translocations, inversions, and chromosomes with deleted segments) and unstable (dicentrics, acen- tric fragments, and centric rings) chromosome aberrations. Statistical anal- yses were based on the percentages of metaphases with one or more aberra- tion rather than the mean number of aberrations per cell, to eliminate the possible influence of individual cells with large numbers of aberrations (6). Although there were few such cells in these three populations exposed to relatively low doses of ionizing radiation to bone marrow, analysis of previ- ous aberration data from individuals exposed to higher doses of partial- body irradiation indicated greater than Poisson variability (6). A test for extra-Poisson variability was performed for each individual in the present study using the exact method of Fisher (35). Statistical analyses were performed assuming a binomial distribution for the proportion of cells with one or more aberrations for each individual. Analyses were performed using the GLIM computer program (36). For 95</page><page sequence="4">KLEINERMAN ET AL.

Adjustment for covariables such as age at blood drawing, years elapsed between exposure and blood drawing, scorer, and smoking status did not affect the results of the comparisons of irradiated and control groups in any of the three populations. Adjustment for smoking status was possible in the TB and tonsil populations only, and smoking was defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime. To investigate the dependence of stable aberration frequency on dose level, linear regression analyses were performed for all three study popula- tions. The percentage of aberrant metaphases was modeled as p = a + bd, where: p = the percentage of metaphases containing one or more stable chromosome aberrations; a = the intercept, or background frequency in nonirradiated controls; b = the linear regression coefficient, which is an estimate of the incremental increase in the percentage of aberrant meta- phases per incremental increase in dose level (i.e., cGy); and d = the esti- mated mean radiation dose to the bone marrow. Because previous studies of stable aberration frequencies determined several years after radiation exposure have indicated greater than binomial variation for a given dose level (3, 6, 37), all regression analyses were per- formed assuming extrabinomial variability. The variance at a particular dose level was assumed to be the sum of a binomial component and an extrabinomial component, the latter involving an unknown scale parame- ter which was estimated by an iterative method proposed by Moore (38). This scale parameter was estimated to be negative for the thymic popula- tion, and thus a binomial regression was performed for this population. Addition of a quadratic term did not significantly improve the model fit for any of the three populations, and adjustment for covariables had little effect on parameter estimates in any of the three populations. A test of the hypothesis that the regression coefficient is zero was performed for each population, and two-sided P-values are reported. An overall test for an association between aberration frequency and exposure to partial-body ionizing radiation was based on the sum of the statistics testing the signifi- cance of the linear regression coefficients from the three populations. RESULTS More than 97,000 metaphases were scored from 496 sub- jects in the three study populations. The distribution of the number of cells with stable aberrations as well as the actual number of stable aberrations per cell is presented in Table II. The maximum number of stable aberrations in a cell did not exceed three. The distribution of the number of stable aberrations deviated significantly from the Poisson distribu- tion at the 5% significance level in more subjects than ex- pected for all three irradiated groups and for nonirradiated subjects for two of the populations (thymus and TB). The percentages of individuals in these three irradiated groups displaying extra-Poisson variability was considerably less than that in a population of cervical cancer patients who had received much higher doses of partial-body radiation (6); nonetheless, the number of subjects with extra-Poisson variation in the three irradiated groups in the current study significantly exceeded expectation (P = 0.0003). An unusually large percentage (7%) of cells from one in- dividual in the irradiated group of the TB population was found to contain unstable chromosome aberrations. The next highest percentage of cells with unstable aberrations in individuals from the three populations under study was 2.5%. Investigation revealed that the individual with the highest unstable aberration rate had recently been exposed to radioactive iodine (131I); thus this individual was elimi- nated from analyses. Table III presents the mean percentage of cells with aber- rations of each type for the irradiated and control groups of each study population. Stable aberrations were more fre- quent in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group in each population. The excess of stable aberrations in the irradiated group was significant for the thymic popu- lation (P = 0.011) and tonsil population (P = 0.033), and approached significance for the TB population (P = 0.080). The majority of stable aberrations detected were transloca- tions. The percentage of cells with unstable aberrations was consistent across the three populations, especially for the nonirradiated subjects. The frequency of cells with total sta- ble aberrations was highest in the oldest group of subjects, the TB cohort. Two or three metaphases having apparently identical sta- ble aberrations were detected in cultures from four subjects, all from the tonsil population (three exposed and one non- 96</page><page sequence="5">CHROMOSOME BREAKS AFTER IRRADIATION TABLE III Summary of Cytogenetic Findings in Three Study Populations Mean percentage of cells (SE) with Study Radiation Stablea Unstableb population exposure aberrations Translocations Inversions Deletions aberrations Dicentrics Enlarged thymus Yes 0.64(0.05)' 0.46 (0.04)C 0.06(0.01) 0.14(0.02) 0.23 (0.03) 0.12(0.02) No 0.41 (0.05) 0.25 (0.05) 0.06 (0.02) 0.12 (0.03) 0.26 (0.05) 0.16(0.04) Enlarged tonsil Yes 0.74 (0.09)c 0.52 (0.07) 0.09 (0.02)' 0.18 (0.04) 0.33 (0.06) 0.21 (0.04) No 0.56 (0.07) 0.45 (0.07) 0.02 (0.01) 0.11 (0.03) 0.25 (0.04) 0.15 (0.03) Tuberculosis Yes 0.86 (0.09)d 0.60 (0.07)d 0.08 (0.02) 0.20 (0.04) 0.28 (0.04) 0.21 (0.04) No 0.68 (0.08) 0.45 (0.07) 0.10(0.03) 0.16 (0.03) 0.24(0.04) 0.19(0.04) a Stable aberrations include translocations, inversions, or chromosomes with deleted segments. b Unstable aberrations include dicentrics, rings, or fragments. c P &lt; 0.05 for comparison of irradiated to nonirradiated subjects. d p = 0.08 for comparison of irradiated to nonirradiated subjects. exposed). Of these four possible clones, three contained translocations, and the fourth clone involved a B group chromosome with a deletion of the long arm. In all three populations, the percentage of cells with stable aberrations tended to increase with increasing bone marrow dose (Table IV). The observed variances by dose agreed well with the variances expected under a binomial distribution for the thymic population; however, the observed variances exceeded binomial variation in the tonsil and TB popula- tions (Table IV). Linear regression coefficients were esti- mated to be positive in each of the three populations (Table V). Only the slope for the thymic population (a 0.8 increase in stable aberration frequency per 100 cells per 100 cGy) achieved significance (P = 0.005). The slope for the TB group was marginally significant (P = 0.07), while the slope for the tonsil population, although largest in magnitude, was the least significant (P = 0.12). The slopes for the three populations were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.1), and a summary test for an association of stable aberration fre- quency with partial-body ionizing radiation exposure in all three populations was highly significant (P = 0.0004). Regression analyses were adjusted for potentially con- founding variables such as age at radiation exposure, years elapsed since radiation exposure, gender (tonsil and thymus only), thyroid scans (TB only), and cigarette smoking habits (tonsil and TB only). Analyses were also performed strati- fied by scorer to adjust for any differences among the four individuals who scored the chromosome preparations. None of these variables appeared to confound the relation- ship between aberration frequency and radiation dose. DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that an increased frequency of cells with symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations may be observed up to four decades after exposure in per- sons given radiotherapy for benign conditions of the head and neck during infancy or childhood, and in young adult women monitored with multiple chest fluoroscopies for TB. Increases in the percentage of cells with stable chromo- some aberrations were detected following high-dose, parti- al-body exposures, although the dose to the bone marrow averaged over the entire body was quite low. A positive as- sociation between cells with stable aberrations and exposure to ionizing radiation in each of the three populations added strength to the causal interpretation of the observed associa- tions. The frequencies of stable and unstable chromosome ab- errations were quantified in mitogen-responsive T-lympho- cytes that were present in the circulation some 30 years after exposure to partial-body radiation. At the time of exposure, both mature lymphocytes and lymphoid stem cells in vari- ous tissues or organs in the radiation field would have been irradiated. Because mature lymphocytes have a finite life span (estimated half-life of 530-1600 days) (39-42), only a small fraction of the original irradiated population would be present in circulation 30 years after the radiation expo- sure. While irradiation of stem cells would result initially in equal numbers of asymmetrical and symmetrical aberra- tions (40, 43, 44), only stem cells with mitotically 'stable' aberrations would be expected to produce progeny many years after exposure (25, 45). Thus it is reasonable to as- sume that those lymphocytes with symmetrical aberrations observed several decades after exposure represent a surviv- ing fraction of the irradiated stem cell compartment that had propagated in vivo during the time postexposure. Because bone marrow is the principal source of all cells involved in immunologic responses in man, including phagocytic cells, lymphocytes, and their precursors, we con- sidered average dose to active bone marrow to be a reason- 97</page><page sequence="6">KLEINERMAN ET AL.

The propor- tions of the body that were irradiated varied greatly between the three groups, being relatively larger in the infants irradi- ated for enlarged thymus, and smallest for persons in the tonsil series. The lack of strong dose-response relationships in the TB and tonsil populations may be due to the rela- tively smaller area of the body exposed to ionizing radiation in these groups. Only 3% of total lymphocytes are in circula- tion at any one time (46), and this combined with a small area exposed to radiation would reduce the probability of many lymphocytes or lymphocyte stem cells being irradi- ated. The thymic population, who had the largest relative pro- portion of their body irradiated, demonstrated the clearest dose-response relationship between bone marrow dose and cells with stable aberrations. At the time blood was drawn, tests were performed also for immunologic function (13), and it was noteworthy that no differences in immunologic function were identified between the irradiated subjects and their nonirradiated siblings. In a previous study of 12 irradi- ated individuals from this population, chromosome aberra- tions were detected up to 40 years after exposure (47). Al- though more aberrations were observed among irradiated subjects compared to five control donors in that series, aber- rations were not dose-dependent, and the investigators were unable to conclude that the aberrations could be attributed to radiation rather than to the underlying disease. Different culture methodology used in the past study makes compari- son with the present study difficult. We found no dependence of aberration frequency on age at exposure in our data; ages at exposure ranged from a few weeks to 15 years in the two younger populations. There are very few data on the persistence of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes from persons irradiated in childhood (47, 48). Among chil- dren exposed to the atomic bombs, chromosome aberra- tions persisted over time and were dose-dependent; how- ever, the children experienced chromosome aberrations in the same proportion per dose as adults (31). A report on in vitro irradiation of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes from three clinically normal children (ages 3 to 9 years) did not find any difference in radiosensitivity compared with lym- phocytes from a sample of adults (49). Investigators did re- port some increased radiosensitivity of lymphocytes from 1-year-olds, but it was attributed rather to functional or maturational differences as opposed to increased radiosen- sitivity of lymphocytes. In comparison with other studies of chromosome aberra- tions in relation to bone marrow dose, the percentage in- crease in cells with stable aberrations per 100 cGy in all three of these populations is greater than the increase re- TABLE V Regression Coefficients (Standard Errors) for Stable Aberra- tions (per 100 Cells per 100 cGy) for Linear Models Using Bone Marrow Dose in Three Study Populations Average bone marrow dose Study population (cGy) Intercept Linear slope Enlarged thymus 21 0.45 (0.05) 0.80 (0.28)a Enlarged tonsils 6 0.54 (0.07) 2.66 (1.70)b Tuberculosis 14 0.69 (0.06) 1.18 (0.65)C a p value = 0.005. bPvalue = 0.12. c p value = 0.07. 98</page><page sequence="7">CHROMOSOME BREAKS AFTER IRRADIATION ported for cervical cancer patients (0.25 per 100 cells per 100 cGy) but less than that reported for atomic bomb survi- vors (6.4 per 100 cells per 100 cGy). Unlike the cervical cancer patients and atomic bomb survivors, all of the sub- jects in our study received less than 100 cGy average bone marrow dose, so that comparison to these risk estimates at these higher levels should be interpreted cautiously. None- theless, they are informative for comparative purposes. Cer- vical cancer patients received partial-body exposures, al- though at much higher doses (800 cGy, average bone mar- row dose), and cell killing was thought to be partially responsible for the low frequency of persistent stable aberra- tions induced in lymphocytes or lymphocyte progenitors of these cancer patients (6). In contrast, in cytogenetic studies of survivors of the atomic bombings, who received whole- body exposures, average marrow doses were reported to be about 100 cGy (3, 50). Another survey of whole-body irradiation (51) recently showed a very low frequency of cells with stable aberrations following lifetime exposure to "high" levels of natural back- ground radiation (range 10-15 cGy). Similar culture meth- odology and scoring criteria were applied as in the above series. A very low frequency of cells with stable aberrations (0.18 to 0.29 per 100 cells in the low and high background areas, respectively) was attributed to the rural lifestyle in China (e.g., fewer medical X rays and environmental muta- gens). The much lower frequency of radiation-induced ab- errations may be related to the very low doses and low dose rates experienced from background radiation. The percentages of metaphases with unstable aberrations were comparable among the control subjects in the three population cohorts. The mean frequency of dicentric chro- mosomes in cultured lymphocytes from &gt;25,000 meta- phases from 131 thymus and tonsil controls (0.16) who were in their mid-30s at the time their blood was drawn is virtually identical (0.18) to that observed by Bender et al. (30) in healthy employees of similar average age employed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Higher frequencies of metaphases with stable aberrations were observed in nonexposed TB patients compared with the other two populations. On the average, these women were almost 20 years older at the time blood samples were collected for cytogenetic evaluation than persons in the ton- sil or thymic cohorts. A possible explanation for this obser- vation is that the TB subjects would have been at risk for exposure over a longer period of time to various unidenti- fied environmental clastogens that may have induced chro- mosome aberrations in either their circulating lymphocytes or lymphoid precursors. We previously observed a similar mean proportion of cells with total stable aberrations (i.e., 0.69) in an older cohort of nonirradiated cervical cancer pa- tients (6). Women in these groups were in their 50s and 60s at time of blood drawing, and these data provide support for the notion of an effect of older age at blood drawing on the proportion of cells with total stable aberrations. This is the first quantitative study of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations in populations who received par- tial-body, relatively low bone marrow doses when they were children or young adults for benign conditions many years ago. Major strengths of this study include the large number of cells examined, identical culture methodology for all three populations with the same observers, and control sub- jects within each population. These data show that partial- body exposure to fractionated ionizing radiation as children or young adults can result in detectable increased frequenc- ies of stable chromosome aberrations in circulating lym- phocytes 30 years later, and that these aberrations appear to be informative as biological markers of population expo- sure. Although the implication of the presence of stable chro- mosome aberrations to cancer risk is unclear (52), it is nonetheless noteworthy that these three populations have experienced excess frequencies of certain cancers arising in the radiation fields. Dose-response relationships for thyroid neoplasms, for example, have been reported for the thymus and tonsil subjects (11, 15, 53). Dose-response relation- ships for breast cancer have also been reported for the TB and thymus series (12, 20). A slight excess of leukemia was reported for the thymus series (10), although not in the other cohorts. Systematic comparisons of the types, fre- quencies, and specific chromosomal locations of persistent aberrations in lymphocytes of selected cohorts of irradiated persons provide a biological index of population exposure (54) and may eventually produce clues regarding the associ- ation between induced chromosome aberrations in somatic cells and subsequent cancer risk.
