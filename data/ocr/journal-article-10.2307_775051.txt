<plain_text><page sequence="1">observation: "The quaint old houses, three and four centuries old, some of them with their huge chimneys and quaint gables, give existence in their darker recesses to mon- strous shadows from the dazzling lights . . ." This could describe one of Feininger's own paintings. While both Hess and Scheyer repeatedly refer to the toys the master made partly for his three sons, and partly for his own enter- tainment, Lyonel Feininger: City at the Edge of the World-the arbitrary subtitle is taken from that of one of the drawings-is almost exclusively devoted to this very special side- line in his career. Feininger was, by the way, not the only modern artist to create toys- Klee, Picasso, Calder also made "excursions into the gamesome world," as T. Lux Feinin- ger writes. In 1911 a friend saw the toy en- gines and cars the painter had made for the amusement of his oldest son, Andreas (the photographer), and proposed that they be adapted for mass production in his father's factory for wooden toys. Unfortunately, World War I intervened and the plan never was carried out. Feininger continued to make toys for his sons. In a letter he half-seriously complained about his "periodical craze for making toys for Christmas," adding: "Every year I get the urge to saw wood into bits and paint them in bright colors. The boys take it for granted that I shall make 'mannequins' for them." As an old man, returned from Germany to his native New York, Feininger spent the winters whittling wood, to produce for his grandchil- dren figures of people and animals that are more fantastic, more grotesque than any he had created before: "The New York figu- rines, recalling some of the mysterious paint- ings of Piero di Cosimo, may be theriomor- phic humans of anthropomorphic animals." Many of the figures and houses are illus- trated, often in excellent color. The artist's son, Lux, is justified in his comment: "The toys an artist has fashioned may serve to gain an insight into the formal ideas of their creator."

As art, they can speak for themselves, but inclusion on technical grounds is hardly justified. The lead para- graph on page 21 states that it is not advisa- ble for artists to make their own synthetic resin emulsion paints, even when the proper ingredients are available. As it will happen, Permanent Pigments in an excellent booklet on Liquitex, states on page 13, under "grind- ing one's own colors," how to do this, saying that a more opaque paint can be made this way and "best color values and paint consis- tency are achieved," a rather honest and ob- jective statement. On the other hand, while not sounding overly enthusiastic, formulas for making your own paint with a number of resins are given. Yet at times it is difficult to decide if the book has been written for the edification of the artist or the protection of the manufacturer's secrets. On pages 72 and 113, references are made to commercial grades of resins and their availability. The implication seems to be that these raw mate- rials available to artists are different than those available to the commercial compound- ers of artist materials. This, of course, is in- correct. None of the compounders make their own resins, but buy them from the same sources that are available to artists. Chapters 13, 14 and 15 contain a listing of available brands of water-based emulsion paints for art use. This is an attempt at comparative evaluation of characteristics and to no one's surprise, Liquitex comes out best. It is, of course, quite possible that a truly objective analysis would have shown the same result. In other words, a "best for your money" evaluation would certainly have served a use- ful purpose, possibly even $15.00 worth. In the absence of a governmental or any other standard here, this type of information is sorely needed. Never-the-less, the basic differences between the various resins under discussion are clearly shown. Part III deals with other than water-based vehicles in a very concise and informative manner, and is a true service. The same can be said for the summation on page 140. For those who somehow can not work their way through the text, this is an excellent nutshell. The earlier mentioned technical appendix by Henry Levison is superb, yet it is a moot point as to why it is included here. It covers new synthetic pigments in an excellent man- ner, nowhere else to be found this way. Fur- ther, it is quite likely that this subject is ul- timately of much greater significance than synthetic resins. Actually a separate book is truly needed. Also included is a section showing comparison tests and how they are conducted, plus a glossary and source materi- als, all most valuable to those who wish to dig deeper. All in all, a very useful book, but a greater distillation and stricter adherence to essentials would serve a better purpose. The Gutierrez-Roukes book covers just about the same territory, perhaps somewhat more successfully, in some instances. The opening chapter has an excellent short histo- ry of painting techniques leading to the plas- tic paints. However, in its enthusiasm it overstates results with such adjectives as "completely stable," "paint films do not crack or darken," all things that only time will tell. Nor is the term "plastics" ever ex- plained. It has a very good itemization of de- sired characteristics, basic requirements, what a good art paint ought to do. Yet it does not explain any distinctions between chemical compounds thus neded. It makes a sweep- ing statement that heavy film applications can be accomplished without fear of cracking or peeling, at best a sometime thing. It con- fuses the "water into oil" and "oil into water" phases of emulsions, only to reprint a paper by Union Carbide on emulsions and detergents which straightens the whole thing out. It only hints at testing procedures and then is amazingly generous in giving credit to the other pioneer developers in this area, no doubt motivated by togetherness as well as safety in numbers for corroboration in- stead of scientific conviction. Chapter Two covers the making of your own paints excel- lently. And again we have a hedge on the polyacrylic esters, stating that problems such as foaming, wetting, dispersing, and plasticiz- ing can not be handled by the artist in his studio; only the manufacturer of acrylic paints can overcome this, a sop to fellow producers. For certain, the willing artist can most assuredly overcome these difficulties. A short, concise chapter on mural painting is excellent. Yet the one dealing with pigments is quite inadequate. Among others, it makes the observation that Viridian is incompatible with Phthalocyanine colors whereas its anhy- drous counterpart-Chromium Oxide-is not so restricted. If indeed so, this behavior is neither explained nor referenced. Twenty pages are devoted again to reviewing avail- able commercial products, by and large re- peating descriptive material released by the various manufacturers. And again no dollar and cents comparison. Further, as before, Politec products are the most. Yet no actual objective analysis establishes this. From here on out the book is strictly downhill. A chap- ter on studio tips tries to say too much in too little space and should best be left for a separate text. The remaining seven chapters are demonstration pieces, " how to" series on still-life, landscape, portrait, etc., all of which really has no place in a technical book of this sort. Aside from the conventions and styles involved, the application of paint from one to another remain of course identical. Chapter two "Making your own plastic paints" however, is by itself worth the price of the book. Both books essentially make the same mis- take in hoping for the mass market appeal to the talented amateur. How many of those will survive the initial technical chapters, whose level of information is far superior to the remainder? The latter of course is pre- cisely what the professional does not need. Thus, aside from the money factor, it is difficult to recommend one book over the other. Whereas the Gutierrez-Roukes book is somewhat more precise, as well as cheaper, the Woody book does have the additional technical appendix and, while it really doesn't belong, is still worth the extra money sim- ply because the data covered is not as readily available elsewhere. HERB AACH New York Bill Holm Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form, xvii + 115 pp., 78 ill., map Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1965. $7.50 The artist-teacher, Bill Holm, appropriate- ly terms his book on Northwest Coast Indian Art "An Analysis of Form." Though he has over the years acquired considerable knowl- edge of the customs and symbolism behind the arts, he has chosen to discuss only the principles of form. His area of study comprises the coast from Vancouver Island to Yakutat Bay in Alaska. The tribes are the Kwakiutl, Bella Coola, Bellabella, Haida, Tshimshian, and Tlingit. Despite local distinctions, these people have produced related art forms, highly conven- tionalized and fantastic. Mr. Holm studied 400 examples of painted and carved artifacts, from his own collection and the collections of other individuals and institutions. They include ceremonial objects, like masks, drums, and rattles, also useful objects like chests, house-screens, and blankets. The ma- terials are largely wood, in some cases also wool, metal, bone, and stone. The techniques include painting, carving, and a combination of these two processes. For the analysis of the techniques the author has devised a meticu- lous system of tabulation, set forth in an ap- pendix. From the copious literature by previous anthropologists and artists, he mentions only the comments on the representation of ani- mal forms, the principles of "splitting" so as to show the whole creature, or of letting a fragment stand for the animal (pp. 8-9). Dur- ing the process of distortion, "the formal ele- ment of the designs very often takes on such importance as to overshadow the symbolic element to a point where the symbolism be- comes obscure" (p. 11). Holm classifies the distorting designs as configurative (showing an animal-like silhouette), expansive (distor- tion or splitting), and distributive (re-ar- ART JOURNAL XXVI 2 214</page></plain_text>
