<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Time of a Detour: Jacques Derrida and the Question of the Gift Michael Naas 'Let us take the time for a long detour.' I begin with this suggestion or invitation because when it is a question of reading and writing the shortest distance between two points is not always a straight line, because when it is a question of the topology of texts the proximity of one text to another or even to itself is never simply given but must be reinvented with every reading and writing. I beg the reader's indulgence, then, in giving me the time for a long detour in order to get to my point, since, in the end, the detour will be the point. 'Let us take the time for a long detour.' This line is not mine but Derrida's, and it comes not from Given Time, the text to which my title would seem to allude, but from Khõra, a little text of Derrida's published back in 1993 and recently translated into English as part of On the Name.1 The line occurs about a third of the way through the text, opening up a discreet though astonishing tear in the textual fabric, a tiny aperture or eyelet through which a whole series of texts, from 'Restitutions' in The Truth in Painting to Given Time, are, one might say, given to one another, allowed to come into proximity with and to haunt one another in the time of an abyssal detour. Through this detour in the Khõra text, Derrida does not simply lay down the groundwork for reading or receiving the passage on the khõra contained within Plato's Timaeus but begins to give himself his own corpus, to be formed and marked by a certain part of his own corpus - which is itself always marked by the corpus of an other. Through this self-marking or donation, this auto-donation, Derrida is able to give us a glimpse not only of this or that text, this or that theme or moment in The Truth of Painting or Given Time, but of the very logic of the gift that is at issue in both of these texts. 'Let us take the time', then, 'for a long detour'. This line, which now forms the beginning of my own detour, a detour that is, I believe, necessitated by the very logic of the detour and the gift, is</page><page sequence="2">68 Oxford Literary Review the translation of 'Donnons-nous le temps ďun long détour .' The fact that this phrase recalls the title of the book that most explicitly takes up the question of time and the gift - Donner le temps or Given Time - is, as I will try to show, more than just a coincidence; it is, as Derrida might say, the chance of thinking, for the implicit or explicit evocation or auto-donation of other texts within the Khõra piece will turn out to be the 'true gifť of the Khõra piece.2 Let me begin, then, by noting that the translation of this line from Khõra as let us take the time for a long detour' is itself a confirmation of Derrida's claim in Given Time that giving can only be understood - and thus translated - from within an economy of exchange, that is, from within an economy where there is always a reciprocity between giving and taking. To give, Derrida argues, is already to take, even when one would seem to get nothing back from one's giving. For the mere recognition that what one is giving is a gift and that the one to whom one is giving it is a recipient is enough to annul the gift, since one is already beginning to take back - to gain the satisfaction or good conscience, for example, of having given without the expectation of return. Thus it is quite appropriate that ť donnons-nous le temps d'un long détour ' be translated not as let us give ourselves the time for a long detour', but, rather, as let us take the time for a long detour'. As I will try to show, there is in every detour a certain taking - especially in the detour of translation - a taking and a self-giving that always aims at some anticipated profit or advantage. But as I will argue by the end of this long detour, the one thing that cannot be taken or self-given in a detour is precisely its time. The time of a detour will be the one thing that cannot be used or capitalised upon, the one thing that can be neither given nor received, since it has, as we will see, the structure of a gift. While we cannot, therefore, take the time of a detour, we can - indeed must - take the time for a detour. We take the time for a detour in philosophy, for example, we go out of our way, in the hopes that by taking our time we may get something in return.3 We take the time for a detour, for a pause, an explanation, a parenthesis, perhaps even a story or myth, because we hope that it will illuminate the philosophical terrain for ourselves or others. In this sense, then, a detour always has the structure of an annulled</page><page sequence="3">Michael Naas 69 gift; just as the gift is always given with the expectation of some return, so the detour is always taken with the expectation of some future taking or taking-back, the expectation of getting back on track - back on track further down the road or with a greater appreciation for the road already taken. A detour is, thus, always speculative, always bent on some capitalisation of time or space. Indeed one could even say that the detour is the essence of capitalisation and investment, a risking of capital that risks nothing as far as the essence of capital is concerned, since even if one loses one still gets something in return, for example, learns some lesson along the way. Like the pure gift of Given Time , then, the pure detour - the detour that would really take us out of the way, that would exceed the economy of return - does not exist. There is detour, and the time of a detour, as Derrida might say, but the detour does not exist. 'Let us take the time for a long detour.' We can now begin to hear this line from Derrida's Khõra as both an invitation to speculate and invest, as a promise for future advantage, and as an impossibility, since the pure detour - the detour that does not belong to the economy of expenditure and recompense, loss and gain - is impossible, or, as Derrida says in Given Time , ' the impossible'.4 If detours in philosophy are thus always speculative to some degree or another, then Derrida's detour in the Khõra piece is oddly speculative since it is a detour concerning speculation and, thus, a detour concerning detours. It is not only a description and a warning of the detour to come but a performative that tries to draw attention to its own performance, to its own possibility. Derrida writes: Let us take the time for a long detour. Let us consider the manner in which Hegel's speculative dialectic inscribes mythic thought in a teleological perspective.... it sublates mythic discourse as such into the philosopheme. (39 / 100) As Derrida argues in the pages that follow, philosophy only becomes serious for Hegel once it has 'abandoned' or rather 'sublated, its mythic form9. For Hegel, 'philosophical logic comes to its senses when the concept wakes up from its mythological slumber'. The</page><page sequence="4">70 Oxford Literary Review mytheme is nothing more than a detour taken by the philosopheme, it ' will have been only a prephilosopheme offered and promised to a dialectical Aufhebung* (39 / 100-101). The serious philosopher would thus avoid such a mythological drift [dérive] at all costs, unless he or she were in such perfect possession of philosophical understanding that the mytheme might have some heuristic value, that is, unless the detour through the mytheme were oriented and mastered from the outset by a philosophical speculation that risks nothing as far as philosophical understanding is concerned. The recourse to the mythic detour in a philosopher such as Plato is thus a sign of either his mastery over the subject or Iiis "impotence" [Unvermögen] to "express himself in the pure modality of thought"' (40 / 101). Derrida writes: Hegel seems to oscillate between two interpretations. In a philosophical text, the function of myth is at times a sign of philosophical impotence, the incapacity to accede to the concept as such and to keep to it, at other times the index of a dialectic and above all didactic potency, the pedagogic mastery of the serious philosopher in full possession of the philosopheme. Simultaneously or successively, Hegel seems to recognise in Plato both this impotence and this mastery. (42 / 102) As Derrida shows, there is no contradiction in Hegel's oscillation; whether the myth be impotent or didactically useful it has nothing to do with philosophical meaning - that is, with the signified concept. The myth is either a sign of an impotence to which one must resign oneself - and is thus not so much a detour as a dead- end - or a dialectic device, a pedagogical tool that is mastered from the beginning by philosophical understanding. In both cases, the pure detour, the detour as such, has been bypassed; there has been a detour of the detour, since what Hegel calls the mythic detour is something understood and mastered by philosophy. Derrida's point here, as I take it, is that for both Hegel and Plato the opposition between muthos and logos is already a distinction of logos, the former always being framed by and subordinated to the latter. My</page><page sequence="5">Michael Naas 7 1 point, in passing through Derrida's detour on Hegel, is that the opposition between a philosophical programme and a detour is a distinction of the philosophical programme, that the detour is always used and understood in the name and in the service of the programme. This is the philosophical point that Derrida's detour through the texts of Hegel on Plato would have us see. In this sense, then, Derrida's detour through Hegel is itself speculative insofar as it helps us understand what is at issue in Plato's Timaeus. And my detour through the Khõra piece is speculative insofar as it would help illuminate the structure of the gift in Given Time. If the distinction between muthos and logos is a distinction of philosophy, of logos , what happens, then, in a text like the Timaeus when we are confronted with khõra - that is, with something that belongs neither to the intelligible nor to the sensible realms, with something that exceeds the determinations upon which is founded the opposition between logos and muthos , literal speech and metaphor? How does a philosophical programme harbour, shelter, or incorporate something that would exceed it - something that would, as Plato himself seems to see, situate the very oppositions of the programme in which it is found? How does a text receive such a detour, such a gift? In what time or space? And how does it receive it when khõra is the name of that which receives all things into it - when khõra would give us the very meaning of receiving? Would the confrontation of such a thing as khõra within a philosophical text constitute the first pure detour - a detour that is neither sheer abandonment to impotence nor didactic or dialectical mastery, a detour that does not find its place within the programme but in some sense situates the programme itself, a detour that does not take place within the time of the programme but that first gives the programme its time? One can begin to see the chronological and topographical complexities that such a gift or detour would introduce into the philosophical programme. If the detour through or of khõra would give the time of the philosophical programme, it would also give the time for the philosophical detours within that programme - and the chance for a detour that would exceed the philosophical programme. At this level, such a thing as khõra could not be simply isolated as a detour within Plato's text, for such a detour would, of necessity,</page><page sequence="6">72 Oxford Literary Review take us out of the Platonic text strictly speaking and lead us - since khõra cannot but be received - into other texts, for example, into Heidegger's or Derrida's. I am speaking here of a detour within the philosophical programme that would open up the possibility of a detour that would exceed that programme - indeed, that would, at the limit, show the philosophical programme itself to have been a long detour that aims to return to the name of an impossibility: khõra , the gift, the detour, Van Gogh's shoes - yes, even Van Gogh's shoes, as we will see in a moment. This is why the detour through the Khõra piece is, if not necessary, at least coherent within a certain reading of Given Time . Indeed I am speaking, in the end, of the 'same' detour - whether it be in Plato or Heidegger or Derrida - since it is by means of this detour that one text can be given to another or even to itself. We are still, let me recall, in the opening pages of what Derrida himself calls a detour through the Hegelian understanding of myth as something that is always guided by the philosophical concept. Derrida's detour is necessitated by the question of whether khõra can be thought in terms of myth or whether it exceeds this determination and, thus, the opposition between logos and muthos. We are edging ever closer to something in the Platonic text that, as Derrida will argue, does indeed exceed both the Platonic categories of muthos and logos and the Hegelian notions of impotence or didactic mastery. We are approaching something within the Platonic programme - a 'supplementary reservation', as Derrida calls it - that would 'lodge, shelter [abriter], and thereby exceed' that programme (43-44 / 103). This 'reservation' concerning Plato's Platonism would not be a simple modification or refinement of Plato's project or programme but something that would actually lodge and shelter his programme, keeping it from being its own source and origin, keeping it from founding itself; and yet, since such a reservation would not itself be subject to, or be a part of, Plato's programme, it would always risk being forgotten in the name of Platonism. We are approaching the khõra - or the proper name Khõra - in a detour that concerns the Hegelian notion of detour, or, at least, of myth in relationship to the philosophical programme. Using Hegel's language in part to describe Plato's programme, Derrida writes:</page><page sequence="7">Michael Naas 73 First, the programme. The cosmogony of the Timaeus runs through the cycle of knowledge on all things. Its encyclopedic end must mark the term, the telos, of a logos on the subject of everything that is.... This encyclopedic logos is a general ontology, treating of all the types of being, it includes a theology, a cosmology, a physiology, a psychology, a zoology. (44 / 103) The Timaeus would thus seem to be a monolithic discourse of the Hegelian type; it would aim to incorporate or give itself an account of all things. And yet this is not the whole story of the Timaeus , probably not the whole story of the Hegelian discourse either, certainly not the whole story of Derrida's detour through the Hegelian corpus. Having devoted a paragraph to this philosophical programme of Timaeus , Derrida begins a new paragraph: And yet [et pourtant ], half-way through the cycle, won't the discourse on khõra have opened, between the sensible and the intelligible, belonging neither to one nor to the other, hence neither to the cosmos as sensible god nor to the intelligible god, an apparently empty space - even though it is no doubt not emptiness ? Didn't it name a gaping opening [ouverture béante ], an abyss or a chasm? (44-45/103) The first two words of this paragraph should cause us to pause and wonder what sort of detour is taking place here. These two words - and yet, et pourtant - have a long history in Derrida, and they form, as I suggested at the outset, a sort of eyelet or tear in the textual fabric that lets us see or lets rise up to the surface a whole series of other texts in Derrida's textual corpus - the most obvious being 'Restitutions' from The Truth in Painting, another text about the nature of the gift. This ťAnd yet' thus itself becomes a sort of chasm or abyss, a sort of khoric space, in which other texts come to be reflected or come to stand, like ghosts, beginning with 'Restitutions' but including the texts that Derrida reads in this text</page><page sequence="8">74 Oxford Literary Review - for example, Heidegger's The Origin of the Work of Arť. 'Et pourtant ' - 'And yeť - is Derrida's translation of Heidegger's ' Und dennoch ', a phrase that Derrida speaks of in 'Restitutions' in reference to The Origin of the Work of Art' as 'an articulation or rhetorical suspense which is very unusual in Heidegger'.5 Now, I should recall here that my point is not simply to trace a series of references or self-references within Derrida's work but to rethink the very notion of self-reference, to rethink it as a sort of auto-donation that can never be completed, that can only take place in and as the time of a detour.6 It is a way to rethink Derrida's emphasis in many recent texts on ghosts or phantoms in terms of a textual auto-donation or auto-detour. Listen once again, then, to Derrida's own articulation or rhetorical suspense: And yet [Et pourtant ], half-way through the cycle, won't the discourse on khõra have opened, between the sensible and the intelligible, belonging neither to one nor to the other, hence neither to the cosmos as sensible god nor to the intelligible god, an apparently empty space - even though it is no doubt not emptiness? Didn't it name a gaping opening, an abyss or a chasm? And now listen to Heidegger from The Origin of the Work of Art' as he turns from describing the famous pair of Van Gogh shoes as mere objects separated from their context, from the earth, to equipmental beings situated by the earth: A pair of peasant shoes and nothing more. And yet [Und dennoch] - From the dark opening of the worn insides of the shoes the toilsome tread of the worker stares forth.... In the shoes vibrates the silent call of the earth, its quiet gift of the ripening grain and its unexplained self-refusal in the fallow desolation of the wintry field.... This equipment belongs to the earth , and it is protected in the world of the peasant woman ...7</page><page sequence="9">Michael Naas 75 The similarity of these two paragraphs, the repetition of the 'And yeť, is more than striking, and might make us wonder whether Van Gogh's shoes are not themselves coming to inhabit, or be sheltered by, or reflected in, the chasm of the khöra , or whether the khõra is not coming to be figured and reflected in the dark opening of the shoes. Such rhetorical echoes or repetitions make us wonder whether one cannot but begin to project one image or text upon the other, whether one cannot but give or restitute one text to another when we are dealing - in both texts and at precisely this moment - with restitution and the projection of figures into a khjric space. It is as if khõra and the Van Gogh shoes had become the reversible sides of each other - a glove to be turned inside out: on the one hand, khõra , the receptacle of all things, the condition by which all things appear, the 'space' on or in which they are projected, and, on the other hand, Van Gogh's shoes, which, as Derrida demonstrates, become things to be restituted in Heidegger's discourse as well as in Meyer Shapiro's, things into which both Heidegger and Shapiro project some figure - be it the figure of a peasant woman or a male city dweller. Such projection, such retrospective interpretation into this 'gaping opening', this 'abyss' or 'chasm', is the moment of what Derrida calls in the 'Restitutions' essay Heidegger's 'pathetic fall' - his fall into pathos.8 It is the moment when Heidegger begins to project the figure of a peasant woman inside the shoes, to fill them with some human form. And so notice that having just evoked this gaping opening or chasm of the Timaeus in the midst of this detour in Khõra , Derrida warns against the Heideggerian fall without explicitly mentioning it, as if the ghost of Heidegger were now coming to inhabit the space of Khõra - that is, the text called Khõra . Derrida writes: Let us not be too hasty about bringing this chasm named khõra close to that chaos which also opens the yawning gulf of the abyss. Let us avoid [éviter]9 hurling ( précipiter ] into it the anthropomorphic form and the pathos of fright. Not in order to install in its place the security of a foundation, the [and Derrida now cites a book of Marcel Detienne's and Jean- Pierre Vernant's] 'exact counterpart of what Gaia</page><page sequence="10">76 Oxford Literary Review represents for any creature, since her appearance at the origin of the world: a stable foundation, sure for all eternity, opposed to the gaping and bottomless opening of Chaos/ Derrida warns us, then, about this 'pathos of fright', and it was precisely this word - pathos - that Derrida used in the 'Restitutions' essay to describe Heidegger's fall, his precipitation in immediately filling the open abyss of the shoes, his refusal to receive the abyss or confront it.10 The ghosts of Derrida's past readings of Heidegger thus come to inhabit the space of this passage; they are there in the tone, in the 'and yeť, in the quotation from Detienne and Vernant that speaks of Gaia - as if to recall Heidegger's reference to earth in The Origin of the Work of Art', and in the footnote accompanying this quotation where Heidegger's own reading of Chaos in the first Nietzsche volume is mentioned. So clear is this evocation, that Derrida seems himself compelled to mention Heidegger in the following sentence, in a place and at a time when Heidegger is not explicitly at issue. After citing Vernant and Detienne, Derrida continues: We shall later encounter a brief allusion of Heidegger's to khõra , not to the one in the Timaeus , but, outside of all quotation and all precise reference, the one which in Plato would designate the place (Ort) between the existent and being, the 'difference' or place between the two. (45-6/103-04) Is it a coincidence that in the midst of Derrida's reading of Plato's Timaeus a detour should take place whereby the abyss that opens up Plato's text should return to open up Derrida's - as if the only way of receiving Plato's discourse on the khõra were at once to speak of it and become consumed or situated by it, opened up to it and other texts - almost, one would have to say, uncontrollably? Is it a coincidence that this meditation on the logic of the gift, which began with this Derridean detour, would itself come to be consumed by this same khoric structure, this same detour, as the only way of receiving it, the only way of receiving khõra as gift or detour?</page><page sequence="11">Michael Naas 77 Clearly, such a thought - such a reception of the gift - cannot take place in any present, cannot be received at any identifiable point or time within a philosophical programme. After this brief allusion to Heidegger, Derrida continues: The ontologico-encyclopedic conclusion of the Timaeus seems to cover over the open chasm in the middle of the book. What it thus covers over, closing the gaping mouth [la bouche bée ] of the quasi- banned discourse on khõra , would perhaps not only be the abyss between the sensible and the intelligible, between being and nothingness ... nor yet between logos and muthos but between all these couples and another which would not even be their other. (46 / 104) The open chasm is closed and the gaping mouth covered over by the projection of a figure within: nurse, mother, receptacle in the case of Plato, a peasant woman in the case of Heidegger. Indeed, even Derrida cannot help but cover over this gaping mouth by projecting the figure of a gaping mouth upon it, that is, by interpreting or reading it in some way.11 And yet, what Derrida's discourse opens up, what it lets itself open itself up to, is a moment of what I would take the risk of calling auto-donation, a moment whereby Derrida gives himself, or lets himself be given, an entire tradition of philosophy that has given itself to itself by means of this open mouth but that has then foreclosed and forgotten this opening - foreclosed and forgotten it by projecting a figure within or upon it. This is restitution and auto-donation - letting oneself be given that which in the tradition can never be made a theme for philosophy and thus can never be given: chaos, khõra , Van Gogh's shoes, the gift. Through this auto-donation, this textual haunting, one begins to see that each of these names can function as the site - the singular site - of the others, each giving itself to the others in order both to name and mark that which is nothing other than the giving of these names. Derrida remarks in the Khõra essay that if there is a mise en abyme in the dialogue - namely khõra - it is not surprising that</page><page sequence="12">78 Oxford Literary Review the discourse about khõra , the very form of Plato's dialogue, should also take on the structure of a mise en aby me. Derrida thus painstakingly maps out the various levels of narration of the Timaeus in order to show, in effect, that the mise en abyme does not simply lead to an infinite regress but to a series of aporias wherein the contained narrative turns out to contain the conditions for the containing one, and the containing narrative turns out to be a moment or example within the narrative it contains. It should come as little surprise, then, that Derrida's own text would be similarly disrupted by this same problematic. Indeed, this is its chance for auto-donation, its chance not simply to give, to give us a new theory of the gift, for example, or to receive, to receive other theories within the tradition, but to question the notions of giving and receiving in a sort of double reading so as then to become - at the limit - itself a gift, a gift to itself, but to an itself that is now nothing but gift. Such a self-donation would always be absolutely unique and thus would resemble the giving of a proper name. But this proper name would name that which has nothing proper to it; it would name nothing but this giving. Derrida in fact speaks throughout the Khõra piece of Khõra as a proper name. While the name would seem to be that of a woman, it is in fact the proper name of that which is always other than the name, the proper name of that which gives us all our distinctions (between male and female, for example) and our names. Instead, then, of describing khõra as the nurse or mother of all beings, instead of projecting the image of some woman upon khõra , Derrida gives khõra the name Khõra so as to mark the singular site where names and, along with them, all our philosophical distinctions, are given. Khõra is the proper name of that which has nothing proper to it. But there is another proper name to whom or to which Derrida in effect dedicates the entire essay, and that is the name (of) Jean- Pierre Vernant. Vernant was cited without being named in the crucial passage on khõra where the ghost of Heidegger came to meet those of Plato and Derrida. This is, curiously, the only time Vernanťs work is cited in the Khõra text apart from an epigraph wherein Vernant speaks of the way in which Greek myth must be read as the other to the binary logic of logos and philosophy: 'myth</page><page sequence="13">Michael Naas 79 puts in play a form of logic which could be called - in contrast to the logic of noncontradiction of the philosophers - a logic of the ambiguous, of the equivocal, of polarity.' (13 / 88) While it seems to me that Derrida implicitly takes issue with Vernanťs understanding of myth in the detour through Hegel with which we began, it is also possible to say, I think, that what Derrida gets or takes from Vernant is the notion of something that would exceed the binary oppositions of philosophy. That is, what he gets from Vernant is an attention to things in the tradition like khõra or chaos. But considering everything said thus far about the gift, considering that Derrida's Khõra piece is itself a work on donation and the gift, can one simply say that this is what Derrida gets or receives or takes from Vernant when a thought like khõra exceeds our understanding of giving, receiving, and taking? This question leads me to recall the final reason why I wished to begin and, as it turns out, end my reading of the logic of the gift in Derrida's work with a long detour through Khõra . For while one can and, to a certain extent, must read Given Time (as well as other texts that treat this subject) as a sort of formal articulation of the logic of the gift, one may also read it as a meditation on the possibility of the text - of writing itself - as gift, that is, on the performativity of writing as gift. And one of the ways to focus or sharpen this possibility is to look at those places where Derrida himself gives, those places where Derrida dedicates a piece to someone, in order to see just how he himself gives or how his writing itself becomes a gift. For is it a coincidence that 'Restitutions' and Khõra - two texts with rather explicit dedications - have to do with restituting, giving, and offering, that is, with assigning, destining, and dedicating? As Derrida notes, an earlier draft of Khõra was first published in 1987 as part of a Festschrift for Jean-Pierre Vernant that was published under the title Poikilia : Etudes offertes à Jean-Pierre Vernant . In the opening pages of Khõra , Derrida recalls this event, thereby situating his work, his offering, and assigning it a place, or so it would seem, as well as a destination. Yet given everything that has been said about gifts and return, one would be surprised if Derrida simply and unambiguously presented or offered his work as a gift to Vernant. Indeed one begins to see in Khõra the</page><page sequence="14">80 Oxford Literary Review philosophical problem involved in the whole idea of a Festschrift. Can one simply offer something to Vernant for his teaching? Can one simply thank him for having helped us think such notions as khõra , for having helped us think that which precedes and gives us all our philosophical distinctions? Would not such a giving or a thanking reveal that we have in fact understood nothing at all of Vernanťs teaching, that we have merely reinscribed the traditional notions of giving and receiving, muthos and logos , that Vernant had supposedly helped us rethink? Given this dilemma or double bind, should one then simply not give or try to refrain from giving - or would this too be a way of giving, a way of giving in or giving up? In the fourth paragraph of the Khõra text, Derrida says that in order to speak of khõra it may be necessary to 'signal toward (/aire signe vers ] a genre beyond genre' (17 / 90). In the very next paragraph, Derrida picks up this word 'sign' and says that 'as a token [signe] of gratitude and admiration' he is paying "homage in the form of a question to Jean-Pierre Vernanť (18 / 90). Notice first, then, that Derrida's homage takes the form not of a receivable gift - like a text - but of a question. But more importantly, the repetition of the word ' signe ' leads one to ask whether a discourse - a giving discourse - in honour of Jean-Pierre Vernant would not itself have to signal toward a genre beyond all genres. This would be the case - structurally that is - if Jean-Pierre Vernant were himself a figure or analogue of khõra . Derrida continues by praising Vernant as someone who 'taught us so much and gave us so much pause for thought about the opposition muthos/logos ' (18 / 90). In a certain sense, Vernant does indeed 'resemble' the figure of khõra , giving us oppositions and yet causing us to rethink them - causing us to go back and begin again. As Derrida later demonstrates, Socrates in the Timaeus occupies a place very similar to that of khõra , for he is the one who receives all the discourses that Timaeus and Crítias are going to produce.12 Indeed, the Timaeus is a sort of Festschrift for Socrates who had delivered his discourse - that of the Republic perhaps - on the day before. Is it by chance that, in this Festschrift for a noted professor of classical studies, Vernant should himself be figured in place of khõra , in the place of what receives all things, all discourses? It seems that Derrida's dilemma in giving thanks, in honouring Vernant, has to do not only with how</page><page sequence="15">Michael Naas 81 to thank someone for a thought such as khõra , that is, for a thought that can never be received, but how to thank the 'one' who 'gave' him this thought without projecting some figure upon him, that is, without some pathetic fall. There is, therefore, a relationship, a fit, between what is given and what gives, between khõra and the giving of khõra. Must there not be, then, a reciprocal fit between our discourse about khõra , or about Jean-Pierre Vernant, and khõra itself? Do we not need a third genre of discourse - a gifted discourse - in order to speak of this third genre that is the gift? For do we really know any more about Jean-Pierre Vernant than about khõra ? Do we know any more about how to give than about the giving of khõra or Vernant? If not, if we are not certain what the name Jean-Pierre Vernant means, do we not risk not hearing him, not receiving anything he has given or taught us, simply by giving back to him what we owe? Do we not risk closing the gaping mouth of chaos by projecting some figure upon Vernant so that we may give back to him? The problem of thinking that which 'gives rise' to the opposition between muthos and logos thus appears inextricably linked to giving homage to the one who has taught us so much about this 'giving rise'.13 Indeed, just a couple of pages later, Derrida attributes not only giving but teaching to the khõra - the very thing for which he is honouring Vernant: Khõra is ... anything but a support or a subject that would give place by receiving or by conceiving, or indeed by letting itself be conceived.... perhaps we have not yet thought through what is meant by to receive , the receiving of the receptacle, what is said by dekhomai , dekhomenon . Perhaps it is from khõra that we are beginning to learn it - to receive it, to receive from it what its name calls up. (29/95-6) Perhaps what we learn from Jean-Pierre Vernant first and foremost is not this or that thought about muthos or logos but what learning means, and perhaps what we receive from khõra first and foremost is not this or that philosophical distinction but what receiving means. In both cases, our learning or receiving must be in some way</page><page sequence="16">82 Oxford Literary Review adjusted to that which is learned or received. And so the discourse on khõra obviously cannot be a mere philosophical discourse that simply talks of or about khõra . Khõra tells us something about itself - about herself - and so our discourse must fit itself to this telling; khõra names itself or, indeed, gives itself a name through our discourse, and this is the meaning I would claim, as I approach the end, of the text as gift - that is, of the dedicated text. The question of dedication is, one will recall, directly posed by Derrida himself in Given Time . Speaking in the context of Baudelaire's dedication of Le spleen de Paris , Derrida writes: By giving it to be remarked, the dedication situates ... the dative or donor movement that displaces the text. There is nothing in a text that is not dedicated, nothing that is not destined, and the destination of this dative is not reducible to the explicit dedication. The name of the dedicatee - or donee - supplies no more proof of the effective dedication than the patronymic name of the signatory (juridically identifiable by civil law) exhausts the effective signature, if there is one. (115 / 87) The dedication destines a text; in the case of a teacher, of someone you owe, a dedication is a way of paying back - and, inevitably, of taking more, since by seeking the gratitude or respect of the teacher or master through one's offering one would always be trying to get something in return for it. Unless, of course, a text were dedicated not to some person but, at the limit, to the name of an impossibility, to the name of that which gives us all our distinctions, to the name of the irrecoverable detour between giving and receiving. Such a dedication, such a giving, can take place only at the limits of an economy, in this case, a textual economy, at the limits of reading and receiving, of Derrida reading and receiving the tradition, of our reading and receiving Derrida, of Derrida reading and receiving himself. The dedication would always be, then, a sort of third kind of discourse to a third kind of entity; it would be neither straightforwardly logical nor mythical but would, rather, 'signal toward 'faire signe]9 its object, towards itself as a movement of auto-</page><page sequence="17">Michael Naas 83 donation that never meets back up with itself. One must thus speak of khõra , says Derrida, not always with the same name, but 'in the same manner ' [de la même façon ] (34 / 98). 14 Khõra is the name, like differ ance, like pharmakon9 like gift, of that which has nothing proper; it is a reference that can have no referent since it refers to what I am calling - and thus naming - the auto-donation of a detour. This auto-donation is both the danger and the chance of the tradition. For this tradition - the one we have received - entails or contains not only a series of themes and objects for philosophical discourse, but, more importantly, a way of receiving these objects and themes, a way of reading texts, a way of taking philosophy. If such a tradition is thus unambiguously received, if it is taken for what it is, for what it itself says it is, then philosophy has in this reception concealed its 'most becoming gifť - the moment of donation. This is what Derrida is trying to draw our attention to, what he is trying to give us, I think, in Given Time , and in all his other texts on the theme of the gift; he is, I would suggest, inviting us to read or take our tradition at the limits of our time and our tradition, that is, to take our tradition in and as the time of a detour. Derrida asks at the very beginning of the Khõra book: And what if, perhaps as in the case of the khõra , this appeal to the third genre was only the moment of a detour [le temps d'un détour ] in order to signal toward a genre beyond genre? Beyond categories, and above all beyond categorial oppositions, which in the first place allow it to be approached or said? (17 / 90) This time, this time of a detour, is the only time, I would suggest, for something like a gift; and it designates the way - which is always the same - of taking a discourse like Plato's Timaeus or Derrida's Given Time . We must thus be willing to take the time for a detour through them in order to be given a chance - if only for the time of a detour.15</page><page sequence="18">84 Oxford Literary Review Notes 1. Jacques Derrida, Khõra (Paris: Galilee, 1993), 38 [. Khõra , translated by Ian McLeod, in On the Name , ed. Thomas Dutoit (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995), 100]. Hereafter, the first page number refers to the French edition and the second to the English. 2. To cite just one more evocation: Derrida says in the section of the Khõra piece devoted to Socrates' desire in the Timaeus to see the city he had earlier described come to life, to see his interlocutors animate it or bring it to life in war: 'Donner la vie - mais aussi la guerre. Et donc la morť - 'Donner la morť is the title of a 1990 essay in L'éthique du don: Jacques Derrida et la pensée du don (Métailié-Transition: Paris, 1992), 11-108. 3. I am excluding all those moments when we are forced to take a detour, even though we usually can, if we are clever enough, recuperate or capitalise upon even these moments in order to derive some benefit or advantage from them. 4. Jacques Derrida, Donner le temps (Paris: Galilee, 1991), 19 [Given Time y translated by Peggy Kamuf (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), 7]. 5. Jacques Derrida, The Truth in Painting , translated by Geoff Bennington and Ian McLeod (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), 320. 6. 1 use the term auto-donation and not self-donation in order to suggest that the self cannot be taken for granted in this donation. The one who gives is not the same as the one who receives; this is not a reflexive or narcissistic giving where everything comes back to some identifiable subject. The self is here nothing but the movement or withdrawal of auto-donation. 7. Martin Heidegger, The Origin of the Work of Arť, in Basic Writings , edited by David Farrell Krell (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1977), 163. 8. The theme of khõra as a place for retrospective hermeneutical interpretations - interpretations programmed from the start by Plato's text - is a theme that runs throughout the Khõra piece. See, in particular, 35-36 in French and 9 in English. 9. One will recall that the second line of De l'esprit [Of Spirit] asks Svhat, for Heidegger, avoiding [éviter] means?' Heidegger et la question: De l'esprit et autres essais (Paris: Flammarion, 1990), 11 [Of Spirit ,</page><page sequence="19">Michael Naas 85 translated by Geoffrey Bennington and Rachel Bowlby (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 1], 10. It is by precipitation that Heidegger projects a figure of the peasant woman into the shoes of Van Gogh's painting, thus closing off the abyss that had opened up, or rather, refusing to receive it, and it is by an even greater precipitation that Shapiro believes he has caught Heidegger at his game and so projects what he believes to be the true referent into them - the male city-dweller. For Shapiro, Heidegger has erred because he has failed to identify the referent. But for Derrida, Shapiro makes the even more egregious error of assuming that he knows what is at stake in a painting, that it is a question of identifying a referent before or beyond the painting. One could thus say that Shapiro closes the chasm of the shoes even more than Heidegger, the shoes that would open up the difference between reference and referent. 11. Derrida uses the phrase bouche bée to describe this gaping mouth, a phrase that also suggests a mouth open in amazement. Fancifully, then, the phrase can be heard to have both a subjective and an objective dimension - being astonished before that which is astonishing, standing with an open mouth before the open mouth of khõra , a bit as if the yawn of the abyss immediately provoked (and we've all seen this!) the yawn of the one beholding it. Perhaps we cannot avoid the pathetic fall of anthropocentrism, the identification, at the very least, of an orifice, of a mouth, the basis for all future object relations. 12. Just as Derrida saw a certain programmation of the khõra in the interpretations that would come after it, he here sees in the so-called 'frame dialogue' a reflection or programmation of the discussion of khõra that comes later in the dialogue. Hence the serious stakes of philosophy are already in question before we get to the philosophy as such, already in the mythological introduction to that philosophy. Here, as there, the question is what dekhomai means, that is, what it means 'to receive'. 13. The question of the relationship or 'fit' between discourse and the subject of discourse is explicitly raised by Derrida in several places. This relation depends, as says Derrida, 'on a sort of metonymy ... [that] would displace itself, by displacing the names, from types 'genres ] of being to types 'genres ] of discourse' (19-20 / 91). We have then, on the one hand, the realm of being, that of becoming, and the third kind that is khõra , and, on the other, logos , muthos , and the bastard discourse about khõra . But what legitimates this metonymy? Does the metonymy</page><page sequence="20">86 Oxford Literary Review break down when it comes to khõra , or is it appropriate that a discourse about the spacing of space take place as 'the time of a detour'? 14. One must speak of khõra , says Derrida, not always with the same name, but ' in the same manner ' [de la même façon]. There is a difference here, it seems, between the repetition of a name and the iteration of a way or manner. But this is not the way the tradition has usually understood the Timaeus , for the line has been traditionally translated not just in the same way but with the same name, translating tauton autēn aei prospēteon (50b) almost systematically as '[khõra] must be called always by the same name', instead of as 'L khõra ] must always be spoken of in the same manner'. Derrida asks: 'And if it is important that the appellation , rather than the name , should say the same, will we be able to replace, relay, translate khõra by other names ...?' (34-35 / 98) For example, will we be able - will we be required - to call or translate khõra by names such as espacement, pharmakon, or differ ance, speaking of it or her in the same manner but not always with the same name? 15. Heidegger writes in the volume devoted to Hölderlin's Der Ister (translated by Julia Davis and Will McNeill, forthcoming from Indiana University Press): 'It appears that we are here taking a detour. In the realm of such efforts, however, detours are sometimes the nearest ways.'</page></plain_text>
