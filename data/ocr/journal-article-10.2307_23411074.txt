Singapore: Periplus Editions, 1995, 160 pp., color, b/w illus., map, US$45.00 (ISBN 962-593-015-9). Reviewed by Eric P. Kjellgren The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The seemingly romantic title, Forgotten Islands of Indonesia: The Art and Culture of the Southeast Moluccas, is not so much an example of exoticism as a succinct summary of the current state of scholar ship on this long-neglected region. Once the center of the spice trade and the often violent focus of European colonial aspirations, the Moluccas today are little known and seldom visited by anthropolo gists or art historians. Although Maluku traditions have been described in the context of more general surveys of Indonesian art, the accounts are general ly quite brief and focus almost entirely on anthro pomorphic figures and gold ornaments (see Barbier n.d., Barbier and Newton 1988, Feldman 1985, Hersey 1991, Schoffel 1981, Taylor and Aragon 1991). The only previous survey devoted specifically to Southeast Moluccan art and material culture is that of Juynboll (1932), now long out of print and limit ed to material in Dutch museums. In a successful attempt to make up for this notable omission in pre vious Indonesian art scholarship, de Jong and van Dijk have compiled what is the most comprehensive and best illustrated general account to date of the art traditions of this important and under-researched region. Drawing extensively on unpublished material from Dutch missionary and administrative archives, the scant published literature, and their own field work in the Babar archipelago, the authors manage to construct an account that is both comprehensive and readable. As made clear in the title, the book does not cover the art of the entire Maluku archi pelago. Instead, it is a survey of the cultures and art traditions of the Southeast Moluccas (mostly with in the Indonesian sub-district of Maluku Tenggara), which stretch east from the island of Wetar north of Timor across the Leti, Sermata, Babar, Damar, Tanimbar, and Kei archipelagos to the Aru islands off the southwest coast of New Guinea. The authors take an anthropological approach, attempting to place each object within the overall cultural and symbolic context of which it forms a part, rather than focusing on differentiating regional styles and aesthetics. The book is divided into three main sections. The first, "The Past," places Southeast Moluccan art in historical context. Chapter one summarizes the all but non-existent field of Maluku prehistory. Much of the discussion centers on the role of 'Dongson bronzes in the development of Maluku art tradi tions. While acknowledging the possible icono July 1997 135</page><page sequence="2">times difficult to determine which numbered cap tion relates to which (unnumbered!) photograph. graphie influence of 'Dongson drums and other artifacts, the authors are rare in voicing at least some skepticism about attributing all aspects of Maluku art to 'Dongson' culture. This skepticism is encour aging as the tendency of some authors to explain vir tually all aspects of Indonesian art as the result of 'Dongson' influence remains one of the last bastions of old school diffusionism in Oceanic art history. The second chapter gives an overview of the eco nomic and colonial history of the region, untangling the complex sequence of Portuguese, Dutch, and English colonial aspirations and the incorporation of the islands into the nation of Indonesia. The emphasis is on trade, in diverse commodities from nutmeg to dried parrots, which left the islands through indigenous and colonial-imposed trade networks, often in exchange for the gold and ivory that served as prestige valuables in Maluku societies. There is also a section on the exodus of art works from the islands in transactions ranging from legit imate sales to objects obtained under duress or out right theft. Ever sawy in recognizing a potential trade item, Maluku artists apparently began to pro duce statues for sale as early as the late 19th century. In the second section, Boat and Crew, the authors explore the major sculptural traditions of the islands in terms of two major themes: boat sym bolism and the cult of ancestors/deities. Based on cultural grounds, they subdivide the region into western (Wetar to Babar) and eastern (Tanimbar to Aru) groupings of distinct but related traditions. Drawing heavily on the authors' field studies in the Babar islands, chapter three discusses the role of the boat as both symbol and metaphor in the western islands with an emphasis on its influence on archi tecture and social structure. Chapter Four provides the most detailed and comprehensive account to date of the forms and functions of anthropomorphic sculpture on Leti and the other western archipelagos. The authors delineate the major figurai traditions and piece together what is known of representations of the ancestors and supernatural beings and the complex gender symbolism of the motifs that adorn them. As in all sections of the book, the chapter is illustrated with numerous color photos of examples from museums and private collections as well as rarely seen field photographs of the objects in situ. The captions, however, are a bit confusing and it is some Continuing the thematic focus, Chapters Five and Six explore boat symbolism and anthropomor phic imagery in the eastern archipelagos of Tanimbar, Kei, and Aru. Again, the authors include many rarely seen objects and field photos. These chapters are particularly important in that as far as I know, they provide the only extensive account of the art traditions of the Kei and Aru islands. The third section "The Language of Things" moves on to consider four other major Maluku art forms: gold ornaments, textiles, pottery, and plait ing, largely in terms of their social roles and gender symbolism. The chapters on gold, pottery, and plait ing describe the basic types, local variants, produc tion centers, and social significance of each tradi tion, as well as their importance in the complex indigenous trade networks of the region. The textile chapter is disappointing in that, while discussing the gender symbolism and weaving tech niques of textiles at length, it provides only scant information on individual traditions. The illustra tions consist almost entirely of details which give lit tle idea of the form of the complete textile. As much of the text centers on the social function of specific types of textile, it would have been good to provide images of complete examples. In terms of overall organization and presentation of the material the book is generally excellent. But there are a few flaws. As mentioned earlier, the photo captions are sometimes difficult to associate with the appropriate objects. Although the text is extensive ly referenced with endnotes, there are still some instances where specific references for particular objects or ideas are not cited. The translation, too, is not without occasional hiccups such as the oddly evocative references to "sexually tinted" objects in Chapter Four. These shortcomings, however, are minor considering the wealth of information the book contains. In providing a thorough and readable account of art and society in the Southeast Moluccas, Forgotten Islands of Indonesia continues a distinguished tradi tion of Dutch scholarship on Indonesian art. By uncovering and synthesizing largely unknown mate rial from colonial and missionary archives, de Jong and van Dijk have made much of this information available to a wider audience for the first time. The 136 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">extensive bibliography is also a valuable resource to anyone with an interest in Maluku. Images of objects formerly available only as small black-and white photos in scattered publications are now assembled in one place and reproduced in full color, making it easy to compare and contrast the differ ent traditions. In short, the book nils a long stand ing gap in Oceanic art scholarship and its thorough textual and visual documentation will undoubtedly make it a standard general reference on the region for years to come.
