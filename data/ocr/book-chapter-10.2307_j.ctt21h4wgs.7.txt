<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 1 Russian Anthropological and Biological  Sciences and the Jewish “Race,” 1860s–1930 “If, in order to make a broad study of various problems of biology and  pathology, an ethnic and national organism is necessary for ‘experimental’  purposes, there is none more useful than the Jewish” V. I. Binshtok. Problems of the Biology and Pathology of Jews. 1926.1 Russian anthropological science flourished from the middle of the  nineteenth century. Because the majority of Russian scientists were educated  in Germany and France, and had read literature published in German, French  and English, it tended to follow in the footsteps of Western anthropological  and biological sciences.2 It quickly accepted the notion that Jews were the  most exemplary representatives of a physical and psychological typology  that was determined by race.3 The father of Russian racial anthropology,  Stepan Vasilievich Eshevsky (1829–1865), for example, after graduating  from Moscow University, embarked on a European research tour where  he met with various historians and scientists. On his return he prepared a  series of lectures on the history of the world from a racial perspective. He  later published these lectures in the book O znachenii ras v istorii (On the  Significance of Races in History).4 Referring to the classification of races  by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, James Cowles Prichard and Arthur de  Gobineau,5 Eshevsky devotes a whole passage to the Jewish race as he  pursues the argument of the unchangeability of races in history: Polygenists stress that racial typology does not change with the influence  of conditions of surrounding nature. Is it necessary to quote an example of  the Jewish tribe [plemia] which always and everywhere preserves its unique  characteristics which have remained unchanged for thousands of years while  Jews lived among other foreign peoples, in foreign climates and under the  most varied climatic conditions, under the yoke of the most cruel and tough  29 </page> <page sequence="2"> Chapter 1 circumstances? Among the Jews one meets today on the streets of London, one  can recognize from the first glance the direct descendents of the people whose  visual images you have observed on the tombs of the Egyptian pharaoh, held in  the collection of the British Museum. (13) As early as the 1880s Russian medical students were exposed to the  theories of racial determinism and genetic pathology, and Russian intellectuals  embraced Western racialist discourse with its accent on Jews as a typical  exhibit of racial difference. The years 1881–1882 saw the first mass pogroms,  which shook the Pale of Settlement, as well as the emergence of political  antisemitism in Russia that was starting to influence public opinion from  the pages of the Russian press.6 This was the time of the mass circulation of  printed and pictorial material depicting the physical appearance of Jews; in  parallel with the textual formulations of anti-Jewish arguments these images  became part of the construct of the antisemitic stereotype. Jews as a racial  Other, whose physical differences were engraved by nature on their bodies  and faces and whose psychological and moral characteristics were tattooed  on their inner “soul,” became a stable stereotype of Russian society and  culture. The Russian historian, Nikolai Ivanovich Karaev (1850–1931), in his  essay “Rasy i natsional’nosti s psikhologicheskoi tochki zreniia” (“Races  and Nations from the Psychological Point of View” [1876]),7 chose Jews  as an example of a race whose psychological make-up is linked to their  monotheism. Karaev followed in the footsteps of Ernest Renan, who linked  the monotheism of Jews to their desert surroundings, maintaining that their  lack of achievement in the representational arts was explained by the poverty  of this landscape.8 With the rise in popularity of Cesare Lombroso’s work on criminal  anthropology in Russia, the link between race and criminal predisposition was  firmly established in a number of works by Russian authors, both scientists  and lawmakers. As we have seen, in spite of Lombroso’s own Jewish origins,  he considered Jews prone to neurotic conditions; his work came to be used  widely as a source of antisemitic references in Russian racial discourse. The  most prominent follower of Lombroso’s anthropological method in Russia  was Ivan Alekseevich Sikorsky (1842–1919), who endeavored to establish a  link between the physical features and the criminal psychological make-up  of various races and nations. Sikorsky published his major work Dannye iz  antropologii (Data from Anthropology)9 in 1902. In this work he maintains  that the anthropomorphic method of anthropology is of value to psychology,  as it is through physiology that one can read human psychology and even  the human soul. He devotes a whole chapter to a number of common  30 </page> <page sequence="3"> Russian Anthropological and Biological Sciences and the Jewish “Race” generalizations about the psychology and physical constitution of Jews.  Physically, they are [s]maller in height than other people, with poorly developed chests; they  have a high childbirth rate, higher life expectancy and lower mortality; due  to this peculiarity Jews constantly grow in number, in spite of the unfavorable  conditions in which this race is found everywhere. One of the most noticeable  features of the Jewish people is their high adaptability to various climatic  conditions, which was mentioned earlier. (260) Sikorsky draws parallels between the permanency of Jews’ physical  features and their psychological constitution, identifying a “moral simplicity”  (nravstvennyi simplitsizm [262]) as their main feature. This “moral simplicity”  is explained as an inability to show a wide range of emotions, thus resulting  in their alleged one-sidedness and grotesqueness of character. Thus, the sense  of pride within Jews manifests itself in vanity, the sense of sorrow in tears  and a “general expansivity of emotions” (262): “The essence of such shades  and variations is manifested by the substitution of multiple feelings by only  one emotion: either the strongest one, or the most elementary” (262). In this  way Sikorsky develops the idea of the primitiveness of the Jewish people in  comparison with their Aryan counterparts; his idea of “moral simplicity” is  firmly grounded in his belief in the inferiority of Jews on a hierarchical scale  of races. In line with the European scientific tradition, in which scientific  arguments were combined with theological and religious beliefs, Sikorsky  uses examples from the Old Testament to substantiate his ideas on the  elemental nature of the Jewish character. He quotes Ernest Renan’s views  on the phenomenon of prophets in Jewish history as confirmation of the  moral simplicity of the Jews — without these prophets, he argues, Jews were  incapable of making moral judgments on their own; they needed prophets to  “awaken and purify feelings, and to lead to the development and growth of  those feelings” (263) as neither the Jewish masses nor the Jewish kings or  high priests were capable of high or delicate moral feelings. It is a logical outcome that, on the basis of such views, Sikorsky arrived at  the idea of the ethical deficiency of Jews due to their inability to make correct  moral judgments. The culmination of these views was reached in 1913 when  Sikorsky was a professor at Kiev University at the time of the trial of Mendel  Beilis, a Jewish man accused of the ritual murder of a teenage Christian boy.  Sikorsky was invited to the trial as a medical expert on matters relating to  criminal psychology. He maintained that Jews were predisposed to sadism due  to the special psychological characteristics of their race. His views on Jewish  blood libel were substantiated by the biological and theological arguments  31 </page> <page sequence="4"> Chapter 1 that had been widely disseminated through the publication of his pamphlet  “Ekspertiza po delu ob ubiistve Andriushi Iushchinskogo“ (“Expert Opinion  on the Andriusha Iushchinskii Murder Case”), published in St. Petersburg in  1913.10 Sander Gilman has demonstrated that this view of the special diseased  nature of the Jewish body, as manifested through both physical and  mental illness, was common in European medical discourses.11 This belief  was certainly adopted by Russian scientists. The medical scientist P. A.  Minakov, in “Znachenie antropologii v meditsine” (“On the Significance of  Anthropology in Medicine” [1902]) refers to Jean-Martin Charcot’s views  on the propensity of Jews to mental illness, in advancing the idea of the  predisposition of certain races to certain diseases: The data that exists on the Jews’ physical and mental illnesses convinces us that  one can not explain the frequency of certain diseases by such external factors as  special everyday life conditions, nor by marriages among close relatives. Even  if certain conditions of Jewish life cannot be excluded from etiological reasons  for their illnesses, they do not play the dominating role, and one has to see first  of all the racial peculiarity of Jews as the reason for their psychopathology and  mental illnesses. Tsimssen, Blanchard and especially Charcot note that no other  race provides us with such wide material in psychopathology as the Jewish  race. The statistical data from various European countries shows that mental  illnesses among Jews are four to six times higher than among other races. Of all  the forms of psychopathology it seems that mania is the most common mental  illness among the Jews. (379)12 The Jewish body emerges in Russian science as a racially alien body,  but it is nevertheless a racially pure body. Russian anthropologists were  divided on the question of whether racial purity was a positive or a negative  category. Jews were granted both positive and negative physical and mental  characteristics; their intellectual brightness and high energy, and their ability  to acclimatize to— and take part in— the economic life of the country of  their residency, were all viewed with ambivalence and served as explanations  for their adaptability and survival. However, in spite of this adaptability to  various economic, climatic and cultural surroundings, their separateness  was viewed as a deliberate strategy of their own choosing. This detachment  explains the anxieties expressed by Russian anthropologists and physicians  concerning Jews as members of their society. It is obvious that, as objects of anthropological research, Jews were to  remain separate from investigators representing a superior race. In the work  of Russian anthropologists, Russians were endowed with superior racial  characteristics, and there are no cases describing racial mixings between  32 </page> <page sequence="5"> Russian Anthropological and Biological Sciences and the Jewish “Race” Russians and Jews. Whenever there is a description of racial intermixing  between Russians and non-Russians in the span of Russian history, such  contacts are described as examples of the absorption of Siberian races by  Russians, with minimum effect on the Russian race. One such example  is found in the work of Anatoly Petrovich Bogdanov (1834–1896) who,  in his Antropologicheskaia fizionomika (Anthropological Physiognomics  [1878]),13 explains that the Russian race could not have been contaminated  by Siberian races because it was Russian men who married Siberian women,  whereas the opposite situation — Russian women marrying Siberian men  — simply is not to be found in the history of Russian expansion into Asia.  Natural selection, he argues, works against the physically ugly men of the  Asian races as Russian women do not find them attractive as sexual partners,  and the same laws of nature make Asian women prefer Russian men to Asian  men because of the natural beauty and virility of the Russian male. The work  of some Russian anthropologists thus describes Russian people as both white  and racially superior. In writing on the racial exclusivity of the Jewish people, Eshevsky in  O znachenii ras v istorii concludes that wherever Jews have preserved their  religion they have also preserved the purity of their blood. Yet Eshevsky also  explains that among Jews one finds variation in the color of hair and eyes,  from red hair to dark, and from blue eyes to brown. Although he does not  compromise the blood purity argument, he does have to make a concession,  and he does so by explaining these changes as a result of various climatic  conditions. Nevertheless, he maintains that, in spite of these variations in the  color of eyes and hair, Jews are physically recognizable as a racial type due  to more permanent taxonomic racial characteristics such as the shape of their  skulls. In a 1903 study, another anthropologist, Aleksei Ivanovsky, concluded  that, whereas it is difficult to distinguish one ethnic group of the Russian  Empire from another on the basis of a particular physical trait, when it comes  to Jews the situation is different: “Jews form a complete and totally isolated  anthropological group that is not related to any other group” (107).14 The views expressed by Russian anthropologists illustrate that, in turn- of-the century Russian medical and anthropological discourse, the Jew’s  body was regarded as an alien one that needed to be kept at a distance to  prevent it from infecting and contaminating the Russian members of the body  politic. The high birth rate among Jews, combined with their social mobility  and penetration into the educated classes of society, was seen to cause two  major threats: the contamination of the purity of the Russian body through  sexual contact and the intellectual impact that Jews could have on social  and political institutions (the fear of seeing Jews in power has been well  33 </page> <page sequence="6"> Chapter 1 documented as an established driving force of anti-Jewish politics during the  reign of the last two Russian tsars).15 Of special interest is the response by Russian scientists of Jewish origin  to the phylogenetic arguments advanced by Western and Russian scientists  regarding specificities of the Jewish body and psyche.16 To what extent did  Jewish representatives of the medical profession accept or reject hereditary  arguments about Jewish illnesses, physical and especially psychological, in  the context of Russia’s heightened interest in the subject of degeneration  and psychic illnesses at the turn of the century?17 This nervous period at  the end of the nineteenth century was thought to trigger nervous diseases,  especially among those people, like Jews, who were believed to have a  natural disposition toward such ailments. An illustration of Russian Jewish  opinion on psychopathology among Jews can be found in an article by the  Jewish psychiatrist Dr. S. A. Trivus, which was published in the Russian  language Jewish monthly journal Voskhod (Dawn) in 1900. The article, “Mass  Psychoses in Jewish History: The Sabbatean Movement,” was the published  version of a lecture delivered by Trivus to the Historical Ethnographic  Committee of the Society for the Dissemination of Enlightenment among  Jews (Istoriko-etnograficheskaia komissiia obshchestva rasprostraneniia  prosveshcheniia mezhdu evreiami).18 The article focuses on the case of the  famous self-proclaimed Jewish messiah of the seventeenth century, Shabbatai  Zevi (1626–1676), and the mass movement of his followers. The Sabbatean  movement was one of the most striking examples in relatively modern  European history of the messianic movement among Jews, spreading across  the Ottoman Empire and the Ashkenazic lands, including Holland, Germany  and parts of Poland and Russia. In his article, Trivus treats Sabbateanism as an example of mass psychosis  and the case of Shabbatai Zevi as an illustration of clinical psychopathy. His  evaluation of psychosis relies on the work of all major scientific authorities  of the nineteenth century, and his list of medical and anthropological authors  is in itself testimony to what constituted the reading canon of the time: Cesare  Lombroso, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Sikorsky. Of particular  relevance is Trivus’ approach to aspects of biology and ethnicity, and what  he regarded as the culture-specific underpinnings of psychopathology. He  navigates carefully between the two modes. On the one hand he establishes  rather firmly a view of the universality of mass psychoses among peoples,  independent of their race or creed, putting more emphasis on their cultural  and religious beliefs. He refers, for example, to instances of witch hunts in  medieval Europe and instances of mass hysteria (klikushestvo) among Russian  villagers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But Trivus also quotes the  34 </page> <page sequence="7"> Russian Anthropological and Biological Sciences and the Jewish “Race” opinions of scientists who stress that Jews are particularly disposed to various  forms of nervous breakdown. In doing so, he channels his arguments away  from the notion of the biologically inherited nature of psychoses, advancing  instead an argument regarding the decisive factor of persecution and anti- Jewish violence as formative in the morphology of Jewish mental health  and psychological behavior. He puts emphasis on circumstances and culture  rather than on biology and inheritability. Because the notion of the messiah is  central to Biblical Judaism, Shabbatai Zevi’s personal psychosis manifested  itself in the delusion of being a messiah. Although Trivus does not doubt that  Zevi himself was a clinical case, he shows that his followers were affected  by mass psychosis due to the especially harsh circumstances for Jews at the  time. As a Jew, Dr. Trivus is thus anxious to promote a universalist approach  to mental illness and to get away from biological determinism linked to race  and ethnicity. With the rise in the popularity of eugenics in the 1920s, racialist discourse  gained new momentum. This movement was fully embraced by Soviet  doctors and biologists.19 In 1926 the publishing house Practical Medicine  issued a collection of articles devoted entirely, as its title attests, to Problems  of the Biology and Pathology of Jews (Voprosy biologii i patologii evreev).20  It was edited by a group of four professors and doctors of medicine and  contained twelve articles written by Soviet doctors and biologists examining  the etiologies of various illnesses and pathologies among different groups  of Jewish people. Their findings were based on the results of a number  of studies carried out in various Jewish communities in Russia relating to  tuberculosis, mental illness, and the unusually high number of gifted people  among Jews. It appears that in the 1920s Jewish people were considered to be  a unique object of study, especially in light of the new trends in eugenics and  anthropology, and the introduction to the book provides a striking example of  the way in which the Jewish body, with its unique biological characteristics,  was treated as a scientific specimen. The introduction explains the aims of  the planned series of “Scientific volumes”: Problems of the Biology and Pathology of Jews is of general scientific interest.  If, in order to make a broad study of various problems of biology and pathology,  an ethnic and national organism is necessary for “experimental” purposes,  there is none more useful than the Jewish. Questions of demography, statistics,  anthropology, anthropometrics, matters of race hygiene and eugenics, questions  of physical constitution, hereditary, immunity, various aspects of social biology  and pathology: all these can be graphically studied by using the body of the  Jewish nation. The particular experimental interest presented by this national  organism is determined by the fact that it can be studied during its long history;  35 </page> <page sequence="8"> Chapter 1 first as a territorial and later as an extra-territorial people, in conditions of  very broad Diaspora and migration, and, more importantly, in difficult socio- biological conditions; sociobiological strata, role of social conditions in the  biological constitution of a national ethnic organism can be studied precisely  on the Jewish national body. It has already been shown that, in its constitution,  the Jewish organism manifests biological extremes: on the one hand it shows  a physical degradation bordering on degeneration; on the other, in certain cases it  reveals an extraordinary physical stability, a hardiness, a biological immunity (3).21 Dr. Binshtok, the author of this introduction, includes in the list of  paradoxes to be studied: the high degree of tubercular infection among  Jewish populations, but the low mortality rate from tuberculosis among the  same groups; immunity to a number of highly infectious diseases; the high  number of endocrine pathologies; nervousness; and the “general disharmony  between the somatic and the psychiatric spheres” (3). This list is of special  relevance to the present study because it encapsulates those biological  characteristics of the Jewish body which, as will be demonstrated, both form  and inform the stereotype of the Jewish body in Russian culture. Another characteristic, regularly featured on lists of the stereotypical  “pathologies” of the Jewish body, is that of interbreeding and incest.  Levirate marriages have often been viewed as manifestations of incestuous  practices among Jews. This question of inbreeding is raised in one of the  articles in Problems of the Biology and Pathology of Jews in which the  author argues that in recent science there has been a significant change in  attitudes toward the practice.22 Thus it is no longer automatically assumed  that marriages between close relatives produce pathological offspring. On  the contrary, it is now believed that two strong and healthy individuals will  produce a strong and healthy progeny, and the fact that the two individuals  may be closely related is of no consequence. The author explains this shift  in attitude by referring to recent trends in eugenics that put due emphasis on  the transmission of abilities and talents to the next generation. He quotes the  opinion of a prominent Russian scientist who had suggested that the fact that  Gogol and Chekhov did not have any children was a great loss to the human  race: better to have another genius like Gogol, even with mental problems,  and another writer like Chekhov, even with tuberculosis, than two physically  healthy, but ordinary people.23 The 1926 volume of Problems of the Biology and Pathology of Jews  quotes statistics from the 1880s to the 1920s, using scientific data from  the same period. It pays tribute to trends in eugenics and, in line with its  theoretical sources, is overtly hereditarian and racist.24 The next two volumes  under the same title, published in 1930, represent a significant shift away from  36 </page> <page sequence="9"> Russian Anthropological and Biological Sciences and the Jewish “Race” the racialist paradigm of 1926 to a more social framework in the way they  explain the etiology of illness and the physical state of the Jewish organism.  The first chapter in Volume 3, No. 2, (1930) sets out this new paradigm. It  overtly attacks racist science and formulates a new “Soviet” approach to  issues of biology and pathology: The aim of this research is to study the relationship between the state of health  of the déclassé Jewish population and its ability to contribute to the work output.  This approach is correct not only from the point of view of social hygiene, but  also from the point of view of a class understanding of social health issues. In  the Soviet Union the principal class is proletariat, and Soviet social hygiene has  to develop measures which will help to build socialism. Many competent anthropologists maintain that, like other civilized races and  peoples, the Jews consist of many different racial elements, and that religion is  the only element that makes up Jewry. So it is pointless to apply such zoological  measurements as those exemplified by the eugenicist views of Galton Lenz.  There is a fundamental contradiction between the socio-hygienic and the  “racial-biological” approach. It should be pointed out that it is scientifically dubious to study aspects of racial  biology and hygiene, because the very existence of the so-called “pure races”  among peoples is dubious (5–6).25 Although Volume 3, No. 1, (1930) contains an article quoting verbatim  Dr. Binshtok’s definition of the Jewish organism as “exemplary,” most  contributions to the 1930 volumes stress the role of socioeconomic conditions  in the biology of a nation.26 This difference in approach between the volumes  of 1926 and 1930 can be explained by the strengthening and unification of the  ideological paradigm of the Soviet Union. Medical science was by now in the  service of the state, and the 1930s were characterized by a change in Stalin’s  nationalities policies from the “indigenization” of the 1920s to a hostile  attitude toward nationalism and manifestations of ethnicity. Differences in  race and ethnicity were played down, with emphasis placed instead on class  distinctions. The new goal was to improve the physical stamina of the Jewish  people, who were regarded as physically weaker than the Slavic population  because of the social and economic conditions in which they lived. The  majority of Jews were viewed as “déclassé,” and the aim of social medicine  was to improve their physical constitution by engaging them in physical  work in order that they might join the two working classes of Soviet society:  the proletariat and the peasantry. A number of studies were devoted to the  physical constitution of various agrarian Jewish communities, which were  designed to prove that Jews from these communities had stronger physical  37 </page> <page sequence="10"> Chapter 1 constitutions than their “déclassé” counterparts (tailors, furriers, shoemakers,  and petty traders). Thus, in order to improve their health and their physical  and mental constitution, Jews had to become members of the proletariat or  peasantry.27 This official script, which privileged social change in matters of biology,  nevertheless coexisted with the ongoing view that Jews constituted a race apart  and that their difference was defined by their biology and pathology. Such  double standards in relation to the “Jewish organism” continued to exist as  part of Soviet discourse relating to Jews and representations of Jews, despite  the racial model being watered down by the rhetoric of class differences.28  This view existed as a silent phantom, which could be sometimes explicated  overtly or implied through various codes. With the end of censorship and the  collapse of the Soviet state in the 1990s these racist concepts of the Jewish  physical body re-emerged and began to be disseminated in various forms of  discourse, both popular and quasi-scientific. The main proponent of racial theories in Russia today is Vladimir  Avdeev, author of Rasologiia: Nauka o nasledstvennykh kachestvakh liudei  (Raceology: the Science of Inherited Characteristics of People [2005]) and  editor of several volumes authored by nineteenth- and twentieth-century  Russian biologists, physicians, historians, anthropologists and ethnographers  on the topic of race. The following statement by Avdeev contains a succinct  formula used by today’s right-wing political and cultural personalities who  theorize their views on the role of racial and ethnic characteristics of various  nationalities in politics: “There exists a rule ancient as the world itself: if you  want to check the certainty of a scientific theory, apply it to the Jews, and  everything will fall into its place, everything will become clear” (303).29 The  Jewish body is thus viewed as an explanatory one as the author delineates the  scientific nature of experiments conducted on this body. As such, the Jewish  body is presented as particularly suited for laboratory experiments, just as it  was in the hands of Nazi doctors in the concentration camps. Avdeev is an  open follower and admirer of those German scientists who articulated racial  theories on the inferiority of the Jewish race and the superiority of Aryans.  The explanatory function of the Jewish body is considered to be its most  valued function, and it is in this capacity that this body is presented to the  Russian reader today by authors such as Avdeev  — authors who, as it will  be shown later in this book, follow in the footsteps of a racist science, which  they resurrect from the past and disseminate. The next chapter looks at the way Anton Chekhov distilled views on the  biology of the Jewish body through the representation of Jewish characters  in his fiction. 38 </page> <page sequence="11"> Russian Anthropological and Biological Sciences and the Jewish “Race” Notes 1 V.
