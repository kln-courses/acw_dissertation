<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INHERITANCE OF PIGMENTATION IN THE AMERICAN NEGRO BY IRENE BARNES Northwestern University INTRODUCTION How is the pigmentation of the American Negro inherited? How does it behave in race crosses? Are "pure" Negro children born to mulatto parents who themselves either could or do pass as "white"? Unverified generalizations and common sense observations concerning the heredity of skin color in Negro- White crosses indicate the popular interest in the subject. Newspaper stories of the birth of a "coal- black" child to white parents, one of whom has a Spanish ancestor several generations back, are prevalent. Novelists of a certain type picture the tragic Nemesis awaiting the red-haired blue-eyed girl, the granddaughter of an octoroon, if she with her "tainted blood" marries her white lover. The modern prophet of calamity observes with foreboding that so-called scientific biology visits the "sins of the fathers" far beyond the Biblical three generations. Popular opinion, especially in those countries in which intermix- ture between the Negro and any other racial group is prevalent, assumes that the result of the cross is a blend in pigmentation. Quite elaborate theories have been worked out applying the prevailing color nomenclature to the type of blend produced by specific matings.1 Biologists in general, enthusiastic over the results achieved in utilizing the Mendelian theory as a basis of prediction in inheritance, and over its ever-extending range of applicability in the field of life below man, assume on a theory of the uniformity and universality of natural mechanisms that it probably holds in human traits. They point out that many so-called blends appear on further analysis to be explicable on the hypothesis of quantitative Mendelism as produced 1 Pearson, Karl.

TECHNIQUE OF PIGMENTATION MEASUREMENT Any scientific study of the inheritance of pigmentation was almost impracticable until a method was devised to secure relatively precise quantitative expressions of the almost infinite variety of shades of pigmentation which any population, either Negroid or otherwise, presents. If one were dealing with control material and could secure a sufficient number of generations and the requisite type of crosses, a relatively small number of cases might suffice, but in dealing with human material the main reliance must be placed upon statistical analysis of large numbers of cases. The color top gives a method at once quantitative, relatively accurate, and easily applied in the mini- mum of time and under the various and often unfavorable situations in which biometrie measurements muet be taken in the field.3 This device, now technically known as "The Pupil's Color Top," no. 8109, originally designed as a toy by the Milton Bradley Company of Springfield, Massachusetts, was first used to measure pigmentation by C. B. Davenport.4 Mechanically it is a very simple device. Paper discs of various colors are fastened by a small wooden catch to the round flat base of a child's toy top, giving a surface which presents segments of discs occupying varying proportions of the field. Of the color discs which come with the top, Davenport and most later workers have used the black, ox-blood red, yellow, and white in matching the pigmentation of the Negro. The black and white discs are identical with the standards in Ridgway;5 the yellow is a pure spectrum yellow, identical with Ridgway's Lemon Yellow; while the red is midway 2 Walters, H. E. Genetics.

The procedure in using the color top to measure pigmentation has been described by Davenport,8 Todd,9 and Herskovits.10 The circum- ference of the cardboard base of the top is divided into twenty units, each representing 5 per cent of the total circumference of the circle. When discs of the four colors described above are fastened to the top, percentage readings of the proportion of the circumference occupied by each particular color may be taken. The discs are manipulated with forceps, and changed after every ten or twelve readings, as the slight amount of grime on the edge of the segments may make a difference of as much as 10 per cent in the readings.11 By varying the propor- tions of the total surface of the top occupied by the sectors of black, red, white, and yellow, and whirling the top, a blend may be produced to match the pigmentation of any individual. In the collection of the data of this study, the following technique was employed. The skin of the upper outer arm was used, as it is easily accessible, and less influenced by either weather or cosmetics than any other part of the body. The individual whose pigmentation was to be measured rested his arm upon a white paper which had been placed on a flat surface, while the upper arm was covered with a white paper in which a small hole had been cut. This exposed a portion of skin surrounded by white for measurements, uninfluenced by reflections from the surrounding skin or the table on which the arm rested. The quantitative expression as formed by the four colors of the circumference of the top has the advantage that it may be 6 Ibid . 7 Todd, T. W., Blackwood, Beatrice, and Beecher, Harry.

Todd, using Davenport's work as a base, made a study of the validity of the use of the color top as a mqthod for the quantitative determination of the percentage of N pigmentation12 in the skin of the American Negro.13 He cites many difficulties to be overcome before accuracy and precision are attained. Fatigue of the color sense results from taking too many readings in succession, or pondering over the match in any one case. In addition, the blend produced by any given combination of sectors differs according to the speed at which the top is spun, darkening as the top slows down. Errors from both these sources are lessened if a prompt estimate is made of the match by glancing at the spinning top after whirling and judging by the instantaneous impression. Any one measurer automatically spins the top at a speed which does not vary appreciably from time to time, and hence this factor will be constant for one individual, though it may introduce constant differences in the results of two individuals. Todd and Van Gorder conclude as a result of their study that the proper precautions should reduce the observational error for the percentage of N pigmentation to between 2 and 5 per cent. Herskovits checked his own accuracy by measuring 48 boys; then remeasuring them on different days, under differing environmental conditions, and using old, intermediate, the new discs in various of the measure- ments. He found his observational error to be rather small, con- sidering all the probable sources of error:14 N (black) - 3.21 per cent. R (red) - 2.15 per cent. Y (yellow) - 2.19 per cent. W (white) - 1.44 per cent. Thus Todd and Herskovits, working on Davenport's original method, have demonstrated the empirical validity of the color top as a practical method for securing a quantitative expression of the skin color of the American Negro. Methodologically, it is unsound. Todd in his latest paper concludes that " under the most careful correction it can 11 In the remainder of this paper, N will stand for the black color. 18 Todd, T.

It is useful only pending the development of a more exact method".15 What precisely do those varying percentages of black, ox-blood red, yellow, and white which are the quantitative expression of the pigmentation of any individual mean? Do they describe something actually present in the skin of the Negro? Or are they merely con- ceptual descriptions of certain proportions of various colors, which, blended during the whirling motion of the top, produce a color similar to that of the skin of the individual being described? Davenport took the former position, asserting that the black constituent measures the melanin pigment; the "yellow probably is due to a lipochrome pigment so widespread in animals and found in the human hair and iris; the red is chiefly that of haemoglobin, and the white is reflected from the opaque skin".16 Todd took the latter position, treating the various percentages as merely quantitative expressions of proportions of colors which, when blended through whirling, match the skin of the particular individual, disregarding any implications as to the corre- spondence of the various colors to specific component parts of the skin, except that the black (N) gives an indication of the amount of melanin pigment. Hence in utilizing his measurements Todd subtracts the 59 per cent of the percentage of ox-blood which is black from the percentage of red and adds it to the black sector reading. This cor- rection makes all the readings in percentages of pure spectrum colors, so that all future work may be directly compared without further manipulation. Todd finds that the correction reduces the range of N to less than one-half the range in the uncorrected estimates, and makes possible the comparison and correlation of skin color with certain measurements of the skeleton. Before correction, correlation of skin color and these same skeletal features gave only chaotic and incomprehensible results.17 For these reasons, the procedure of Todd and Herskovits has been followed in this study, and all percentages of black (N) pigmentation as given have been corrected by the addition of 59 per cent of the ox-blood red percentage of the same individual 15 Todd, T.

Davenport on The Inheritance of Skin Color in Negro-White Crosses.1* Davenport's plan was to seek for the key crosses from a Mendelian standpoint, secure as many generations as possible, and then analyze the heredity as it operates in specific families. On the basis of series measured in Jamaica, Ber- muda and Louisiana, and using the black percentage uncorrected for the percentages of black in the ox-blood red, Davenport concluded that " there are two (double) factors, (A and B), for black pigmenta- tion in the full-blooded Negro of the West Coast of Africa, and these are separately inheritable".19 Davenport's study, while very valuable as a preliminary attempt to study pigmentation inheritance by quanti- tative methods, is not acceptable as a final analysis, if indeed any study based on color-top readings could possibly be. Todd has shown that when his readings were corrected for the percentage of black in the red, the bimodality of the curve for unmixed Negroes on which Davenport had based much of his genetic reasoning disappeared and a monomodal curve replaced it.20 Davenporťs analysis is based on too few cases to furnish more than a fertile hypothesis, and, even were the number of cases greater, his methodology is not precise enough to prove many of his hypotheses. As an example, on page 24 he says that " there is a sex difference in the rate of development of pigmentation," the statement being based almost entirely on the percentage of N of the males and females in the one and two year groups. But when his data are corrected for the percentage of black in the red, the males have a higher percentage of N in the one year group and the females in the two, instead of the females having a higher percentage of N in both age groups as in his uncorrected figures.

Finally, concentra- tion of frequencies at certain percentages of N, and therefore the conclusions based on it, is dependent on the validity of the failure to correct for the black percentage in the red. Chance has too much opportunity to operate in a small number of cases to attach great significance to slight differences. Though Davenporťs analysis of the inheritance of pigmentation cannot be accepted as final, it has been extremely valuable in demon- strating the practicability of the use of the color top to secure quantita- tive data for a study of this type. The methodological defects underlie both his work and ours, but a different analytical technique and a much larger series of measurements may make the reinvestigation of the problem of some value. MATERIAL The most comprehensive study yet made of the physical anthro- pology of the American Negro is that of Dr. M. J. Herskovits.21 Series representing 5,659 individuals, of whom 3,378 were males and 2,281 females, and including individuals of all ages, were measured for from 18 to 30 traits. The measurements were taken from 1924 to 1927 in New York City; Washington, D. C. ; Nashville, Tennessee ; Tuskegee, Alabama; among the rural population of West Virginia; and, in 1915, a smaller series of 351 in eight cities of the South. Pigmentation readings were taken by the use of the color top for most of these individuals, but were available for a study of the inheritance of pig- mentation only in those series in which measurements were taken for family groups. In addition to permitting the use of this mine of material, Dr. Herskovits has given frequent and invaluable assistance in the analysis of the problem and the techniques to be utilized. The frequency distribution of the four series of measurements which were utilized in this study is given in Table I. Series I and II were measured by Dr. Herskovits and Mr. Louis King in the Harlem population of New York City in the winter of 1925-26. School children were chosen as representative of the general Harlem popula- tion, and measurements of both them and their parents taken to furnish 21 For a partial list of the published results, consult the bibliography at the end of this study.</page><page sequence="8">328 Human Biology family groups.

NNW - more Negro than White. NW - approximately equal amounts of Negro and White. NWW - more White than Negro. Despite the popular opinion that the Negro does not know his ancestry, Dr. Herskovits has shown by a consideration of physical traits that these genealogies are statistically valid in the sense that in the majority of those traits in which the two races differ, the mean and standard deviation of the NNW are more like the Negro; the NW intermediate; and the NWW more white.24 Thus the material for this study con- tains not only quantitative expressions of the pigmentation of over 600 families, but statistically valid information concerning the approxi- mate amount of race mixture represented in each individual and in each family. Pigmentation readings were not available for every one of the individuals of the four series. Poor light, sun-burned skin, or other difficulties often made a reading impossible, or, if taken, valueless for our purpose. Only 4003 individuals were actually utilized for this study; 2173 for Series I; 1495 for Series II and III combined; and 365 for Series IV. Each of these series included many individuals, usually school children, for whom there were no measurements of the family, either parents or brothers and sisters. These single individuals were utilized in the computation of growth curves, as they are obviously from the same general population as the families in the same series, but of course could not be utilized in the actual study of pigmentation inher- itance. Eliminating them, there are 637 families, containing 2391 individuals. Table II shows the number of families in each series, the composition of the families as regards number of children, and whether measurements of one or both parents were secured. 23 Herskovits, M. J.

The color top is essentially a subjective device, the reading depending on the individual's perception of the blend of a particular combination of sectors of black, red, yellow, and white as matching the skin of a given Negro. The readings of any one individual are quite accurate, with an average observational error of only 2 to 5 per cent. But are the readings of two individuals comparable? And, if not, is there a consistent difference between them which, when eliminated, permits the readings to be treated as if made by one individual? Herskovits in his previous studies of pigmentation has never combined series measured by different observers.26 In the four series of this study containing family groups, there are measurements taken by Herskovits (Series I); King (Series II and III); and Miss Hurston (Series IV). The desirability of having large numbers of measurements makes it necessary to combine these series. The measurements of Herskovits and Miss Hurston have as their only check readings of both on the same nine individuals. The difference in observation of N on the color top was only 1.33 per cent, Herskovits being darker. The small number of cases makes this of doubtful validity as an accurate measure- ment of their differences.26 However, since Series IV, being selected well-to-do Negroes, and non-representative of the total Negro popula- tion of the country, is eliminated from the computation of growth curves, and is treated separately in all later stages, it is accepted as being comparable to* Series I without any correction for the personal factor in measurement. How do the measurements of King and Herskovits compare? Herskovits has previously made some tests as to the comparability of the two series. In a test sample of 100 boys, the readings for N are:27 King - mean percentage N, 72.92 ± 12.84. Herskovits - mean percentage N, 73.65 ± 9.28. But in the series measured on the Harlem population by the two men, King's results were consistently darker. In adult male American-born 26 Herskovits, M. J.

The much greater variability of King, ± 12.84 as opposed to that of ±9.28 for Herskovits, lends plausibility to this theory. These analyses of Herskovits justify us in accepting the fact that King's measurements for the same population were on the average darker than his own. The problem before us is to secure a quanti- tative expression of this difference. Boas dealt with this same question of the personal equation in measurements in his study of head form.29 He assumed that the personal equation of the observers was distributed according to the laws of chance, the difference between the average of any one observer (a) and the true average (A) consisting of the accidental error (a;) plus the personal equation (é). A - a = X + € From this, Boas found that the general average may be obtained by giving the average obtained by each observer the weight : W = ~ b + w In our study, dealing principally with the measurements of only two men, the assumption that the errors due to the personal equations of various observers are distributed according to the laws of chance around a true average is inapplicable. Accordingly, the better proce- dure is to correct the readings of one observer (A) to those of the other (a) on the assumption that the difference between the average of the 28 Ibid., p. 117. 29 Boas, Franz.

A - a - x + € And, in large samples the accidental errors cancel out, so that we may use as a working formula: A - a = € Taking the adult males measured by the two men as samples, the mean pigmentation of Herskovits' measurements is 66.65 ± 13.98; of King's, 73.50 ± 13.11. King's readings are on the average 6.93 per cent darker than those of Herskovits, and, on the assumption that the accidental errors in observation either cancel out or are similar for the two men, we shall accept this as representing the personal equation in measurement. Since the observational error is ±3 per cent, a difference of 6.93 may be taken for all practical purposes as 7 per cent. In order to eliminate the personal equation, which may be assumed to represent a consistent difference between the measurements of the two observers, all King's readings were reduced 7 per cent, making them comparable to those of Herskovits. This is admittedly an empirical procedure, to be justified only by the consistency of the results for the two homogeneous series. Methodologically it is somewhat questionable on several counts. First, one must admit analogical reasoning if it is assumed that because the series measured by the two men show no significant differences in other traits, therefore they must be similar in relative darkness of skin. But the presumption tion is in favor of it, and this together with the very much greater variability of King when measuring the sample of 100 boys, and his greater darkness in the known Harlem series, justifies risking the initial correction provided it is checked at all later stages in the investigation by manipulating the various series separately. Second, the difference of 7 per cent is an average, and like all averages it is rather a conceptual symbol than characteristic of all the data entering into its computation. It represents an average of the consistent differences between the two series, while the difference in any individual case between the two readings might differ with the relative lightness or darkness of the individual being measured. For example, the percentage difference between the readings of a very dark individual, say between 75 and 80 per cent N, might possibly be greater than the difference between the readings for a very light individual, say between 25 and 30 per</page><page sequence="14">334 Human Biology cent N. However, with an original observational error of 3 per cent, the slight inaccuracy which might result from this hypothetical difficulty would be negligible. After the correction the differences in the average pigmentation for any age group for the two men are fluctuating, and, where the number of cases is very large, slight. The approximation to equality is greater as the number of cases increases. For example, in the one year class, males, Herskovits' series is for four individuals, mean 80; King's, for two, 57.5. But when the 6 to 15 year groups for males are taken, where the number of cases is large, the series measured by the two observers are very similar, never differing more than ±3 per cent.

That skin color does change with age has been asserted by most students. Davenport found that "the proportion of black in the skin increases to about the age of 10 or 12, and then slowly diminishes. "30 Todd and Van Gorder state that "the period of darkest skin is 10-19 years, but the average of this period is fairly steadily maintained until the late forties, after which there does seem to be a diminution in the blackness of the skin."31 Herskovits made a study of age changes in pigmentation in the series measured by himself alone, and found that there was a fairly steady increase in the percentage of N (with the exception of 11^ years) from the year average of 64.23 ± 14.7 to the 17^ year average of 74.07, while the average of the adults was 66.40 ± 13.85. 32 Obviously the results of none of these studies are quantitatively precise enough to permit the correction of the readings of all age groups to those of one specific age. Even if they were, the percentage change with age might be different for Negro populations of different origins and containing different amounts of racial intermixture. For these reasons, growth curves were made for Series I, II, and III, both separately and combined. Series IV, consisting of the measurements of a selected well-to-do and professional Harlem group, was excluded as it is admittedly not a random sample of the population and would over- weight those age groups in which it contained many individuals with a larger proportion of lighter individuals than are typical of the normal age distribution in the population as a whole. Since the entire population, and hence any given age group within the population, is chosen at random, the distribution of different percentages around the mean for that age group should be approxi- mately the same in each age group, given a sufficient number of cases.33 On this assumption, the truth of which is substantiated by the standard deviations for the various age groups, changes in the mean pigmentation from year to year could be taken as indicating age changes. Means were secured for each age and each sex from 1 to 20 ; by five year periods from 20 to 60; and for all individuals over 60, for Series I, II and III separately. Taking the similarity of mean pigmentation and the general consistency of change as indicating fairly homogeneous samples, 30 Davenport, C. B. Op cit., p. 7. 31 Todd, T.

The data thus combined confirm the conclu- sions of Davenport34, Todd,36 and Herskovits,36 that there are no sex differences in the pigmentation of the American Negro. Wherever the number of cases in any one age is large, the mean of males and females tends to approach. Such differences as exist are fluctuating, some- times one and sometimes the other sex being darker. Fig. 1. Comparative Percentage of N.

This ideal curve, the values for which are given in Table V, was tested by fitting it to the smoothed curve for the sexes taken separately. Deviations above and below it are random in the curves secured by plotting it above the actual means of the combined sexes or male and female separately. It may be taken as representing the age changes in pigmentation for the American Negro population of the amount of intermixture and the average pigmentation of the various series Herskovits used in his studies. Fig. 2. Age Changes in Pigmentation of the American Negro In summary, the percentage of N pigmentation of the Amercian Negro increases quite regularly until adolescence, reaches a peak at the age of 14, 15, and 16; decreases quite rapidly until the age of 30 to 35; and then decreases slowly the remainder of life. The precise figures for various ages are of use for our particular study, but of little value as a general statement of age changes, as the average for any given age obviously depends upon the percentage of intermixture and the general lightness or darkness of the population one is consider- ing. However, if these 3652 individuals may be taken as representa- tive of the fairly homogeneous physical type of the American Negro, then for the American Negro there is an increase from the one year mean of 66 per cent to the 15 year mean of 72.50 per cent; a decrease to the 30-34 mean of 67 per cent; and then a slow decrease to the mean of 64 per cent for all individuals over 60.</page><page sequence="20">340 Human Biology The ideal curve as thus secured was used as the basis for correcting readings of all individuals to those of the age group 35-39, the adult group with the largest number of individuals in it. There is a slight source of error in this method of correction in that it, just as the correction of the readings of different observers, represents an average of the pigmentation changes from year to year which might and possibly would not represent the precise amount of change for any particular individual in the population. An individual with 32 per cent N at the age of 17 might not lighten as much with increasing age as one with 76 per cent N. Two individuals each with 76 per cent N at the age of 17 might lighten by different amounts by the time they were 35. However, again considering the 3 per cent observational error, and the lack of statistical bias involved, any inaccuracies from this source are of slight significance. It might be desired that the technique of color determination were capable of yielding measure- ments precise to l/10th of 1 per cent, and absolutely objective in the sense that the personal equation of the measurer would not influ- ence the result. In this case, the correction for age changes would need to be done by a more refined technique, but, given the large observational and personal error, the present method of correction is as valid as any. After correction for personal differences in the observers and for age changes, there is a range of only 3.37 per cent in the mean per- centage N of the three non-selected series, while the selected series is 10.46 per cent below the lowest of the other three.

The decreasing mean pigmentation and increasing variability as the amount of white intermixture increases is in accordance with theoretical expectations if - both the genealogies and the readings with their corrections for various factors were valid. This fact, together with Herskovits' demonstra-</page><page sequence="21">Inheritance of Pigmentation 341 tion through a study of physical traits that the genealogies secured for his group of 539 Howard University Negroes were statistically valid,37 permits us in our later analysis of heredity to utilize these genealogical classes as indicating roughly the percentage of intermixture in various groups. Fig. 3(a). Percentage Frequency Distribution op American Negroes by Per Cent of N Pigmentation, by Genealogical Classes Attention may be called here to the greater variability of the N WW as contrasted to the NW (Table VI).

The first hypothesis made as to the nature of the inherit- ance of pigmentation was that it was a blend. If there is a true blend, and not merely Mendelian heterozygotes, then diverse parents produce offspring intermediate between them in type, with no segregation of</page><page sequence="23">Inheritance of Pigmentation 343 the parental traits in the second filial generation. If this conception of the fusion of parental hereditary qualities holds in the concrete instance, the average pigmentation of the offspring must be the same as the average pigmentation of the parents. The pigmentation of the sons, daughters, and all children for each family was averaged separately, and the pigmentation of the parents averaged in those cases in which the measurements of both parents were available. Tables VII (a), VIII, and IX give the average value of offspring, sons, and daughters for the average percentage of the parents, for the fathers, and finally by mothers, by 3 per cent groups, all series combined.

The means and standard deviations of the various age groups show a remarkable similarity in the average percentage of males and females in the various age groups, and there is no consistent difference in the averages of sons and daughters for the given percentage parent. The similarity of the regression coefficients for both sons and daughters in all cases offers still further proof of the absence of sex differences in pigmentation in the American Negro population. What do these series of averages indicate as to the resemblance of parents and children? In Table VII the average of the offspring is above that of the parents in the lower percentages; approximately the same from 50 to 69 per cent; generally falling within the same</page><page sequence="26">346 Human Biology 3 per cent group as the average percentage of the parents; and below that of the parents from 69 per cent to 87 per cent.

Logi- cally it would seem that the regression coefficient for all children should be intermediate between those for sons and daughters, since the averages used for securing the coefficient for all children are an average of all the individual family averages in any frequency group. But it must be remembered that there are many families in which the children are of one sex entirely. For example, where the percentage of N is 70-72, there are 31 families with offspring of both sexes and a mean pigmentation of 69.74; 26 with sons of a mean pigmentation of 69.88; and 19 with daughters of a mean pigmentation of 70.38. Since this condition, in which the average of all children for any average per cent N parents maybe greater or less than that of the aver- age of either sons or daughters taken separately for the same aver- age per cent N parents, is secured in many of the various frequency groups which form the data for the computation of the regression coefficients, it follows that the cofficient of regression of all offspring may be either greater, less, or intermediate between that for Son,s and daughters taken separately. The correspondence between the actual data and the regression line is very close. For the regression of all offspring on parents, the average difference of the actual data from the regression line is only 1.63 per cent; of sons on parents, 2.43 per cent; and of daughters on parents, 1.52 per cent. The regression coefficients of offspring on the various percentages of fathers and mothers, taken separately, are greater than those on the average percentage of the two parents. Here again there are no consistent differences as between the regression of either sons or daughters on the same sex parent, or the regression of both on parents of different sex. There is no indication of sex linkage or sex dominance in inheritance. The regression of offspring by genealogical classes shows the same tendency for the offspring to deviate less from the mean of the gene- alogical class than do the parents. In the unmixed Negro, the regres- sion coefficient of offspring on parents is 3.31, but the validity of this regression is questionable because of the number of cases in the extreme percentages. In the NNW group, the regression coeffi- cient is 2.38; in the NW, 2.36; and in the NWW, 1.76. The corre- spondence between the average percentage of parents and the average percentage of the children becomes less as the amount of racial intermixture increases. The greater the racial heterogeneity, the</page><page sequence="30">350 Human Biology less stable the family lines and the more they tend to regress to the modal pigmentation percentage of the group. This analysis of the data secured by the use of averages offers the following evidence pertaining to the resemblance of parents and children: 1. There is no sex difference in the resemblance of offspring to parents in the series of averages. 2. The average percentage of N of the offspring tends to conform quite closely to the average of the parents in the middle ranges of pigmentation; to be above it in the lower percentages; and below it in the higher, as would be expected. 3. The changes in the pigmentation of parents and children tend to bear a systematic relationship to each other which may be expressed by means of the coefficient of regression, children almost always differing less from the mean pigmentation of the group than their parents, which is according to expectations. 4. Regression coefficients of both sons and daughters taken sepa- rately show no consistent differences, nor is there any consistent difference whether the regression be on father or mother. 5. The regression coefficient, and hence the regular simultaneity of change, is less as the amount of white intermixture increases: 3.31 in the N; 2.38 in the NNW; 2.36 in the NW; and 1.76 in the NWW. Apparently these series of averages, while suggestive, do not give us definitive evidence as to the precise method of the inheritance of N pigmentation in the American Negro. Another method of attack is through the comparative variability of groups representing different amounts of racial intermixture. The general biological assumption has been that when race crossing occurs, the hybrid offspring is more variable than either uncrossed race.39 Obviously if the Mendelian hypothesis as commonly conceived is to hold for the inheritance of any particular trait in which the two inter-breeding races differ widely, the variability of a hybrid offspring must be greater than either parent race. What are the actual facts as regards variability in Negro-White crosses relative to the variability of the unmixed Negro? First, we may compare the total variability for the various genealogical classes, expressed in terms of the mean square deviation of the individuals of 39 e.g., Castle, W. E.

This may perhaps be taken to be in accord with expectations Genealogical Class No, Individuals Mean Percentage N ± a N 492 72.74 ± 8.93 NNW 1063 67.19 + 11.21 NW 445 58.73 ±11.12 NWW 391 52.73 ± 12.35 Total: 2391 64.37 ± 13.02 if segregation in inheritance of pigmentation were occurring. The greater variability of the NWW class, here as well as in the fraternal variability, when compared to the NW class, which is theoretically more racially heterogeneous, is rather difficult of interpretation. Until further research has been carried out in the pigmentation of various Caucasoid groups, and their variability determined, any explanation we might offer would be too speculative to possess any value. But the total variability of any population may be conceived as consisting of two types of variability, that within the families of the population, and that between the various family lines. Fraternal variability, or the differences of brothers and sisters within the family, indicates whether segregation, blending, or some other phenomenon as yet undescribed is occurring in the inheritance of any specific trait in which the parental stocks differ. The variability of family lines indicates the homogeneity or heterogeneity of a population for a particular trait. If a population is of unmixed racial stock, or if there 40 Herskovits, M. J. The American Negro: A Study in Race Crossing. P. 15.</page><page sequence="32">352 Human Biology has been early intermixture followed by long-continued in-breeding, there will be slight variability between family lines, as all families may be regarded as having essentially the same ancestors.41 Hence, provided intermixture has been relatively recent, the family variability of any given group as regards N pigmentation will show the racial heterogeneity of that group, and thus the amount of variability that would be expected within the families of that group were Mendelian segregation occurring. The relation of fraternal and family variability in this American Negro population, known to be racially heterogene- ous, should indicate the types of matings which have been taking place in the majority of cases, and this in turn should aid us in deciding what types of variability to expect in various groups in accordance with the various hypotheses as to the method of inheritance which we may later examine. The method of determining the variability of family lines has been worked out by Professor Franz Boas42, who started with the assumption that the deviation of any individual from the general mean of the population of which he is a part ( x ) will consist of his deviation from the average of his family (£), and the deviation of that average itself from the general mean ( rj ). (1) x = £ + rj The mean square variability will then equal: (2) [x2] = [£2] + И the brackets indicating averages. Developing this formula we find that S2/, the variability within the families, is equal to: (3) a2( 1 -t)43 However, starting from a slightly different point, Professor Boas has developed a somewhat simpler approach to the problem which 41 Herskovits, M.

If we assume the deviation of an individual (¿1) to be composed of his deviation from the average of his family {xi), and that of this average from that of the entire population, (7?), then: (1) ii = rj + Xi The deviation of his brother will be : (2) i 2 = r? + x2 and (г3), (¿4) etc. for each member of the fraternity. Subtracting, (3) (¿1 - i 2) = (77 + si) - (v + s2). = £1 - x2. The mean square variability of this will of course represent the variation within the family, or (4) [(ii - г2)2] = [(xi - X2)2) = [*i2] - 2[xx] + И. However, (5) [x2] = a2 of the entire population. And: (6) [xx] = ra2 Hence : (7) [{i' - г2)2] = 2&lt;r2 - 2га2 = 2(7 2 (1 - г). which is, of course, the same. The error of the fraternal variability is derived from the mean square variability of the difference, (8) [xi - x2 - xz . . . xn ]2 assuming families of an infinite number of children, and is found to be: (9) W g'(1 - (9) W n (n - 1) The weighting to be given families of differing numbers of children, therefore, will be n(n - 1), n representing the number of children in any one family. This latter formula was used in computing the 44 Boas, Franz. As yet unpublished.

If the Mendelian hypothesis is to hold, the fraternal variability of the cross between any two racial groups must be somewhat greater than that of either parent group in any trait in which there are decided differences, and the amount of such difference should be greatest at the point of greatest racial mixture. In Table XI the number of families and the fraternal variability by genealogical classes are given, both for the component series and for the entire population.

Where the pigmentation percentage of one of the parents is unknown, there is a chance that he or she may not have belonged to the unmixed Negro group. The greater variability of the N( 1 parent) group as contrasted to the N( 2 parents) group indicates that there probably is some white intérmixture in the N group with one parent. Theoretically the fraternal variability should increase in the N, NNW and NW classes, this latter being the most racially hetero- geneous, and then decrease with the NWW, which is more nearly white than Negro. This relationship is found in Series ^Herskovits' Harlem), and Series III (King's West Virginia); but in Series II (King's Harlem) the variability of the NWW is very much greater than that of the NW, while in Series IV (Miss Hurston's Selected Harlem), it is slightly greater. Considering the number of families</page><page sequence="35">Inheritance of Pigmentation 355 involved in the NW and the NWW in Series II, 14 in the former and 9 in the latter, it is not felt that much significance may be attached to the increase in variability from 7.10 to 12.23 in this series alone. In the other three series, based on more families, the variability in the NW and the NWW group is approximately the same. The fraternal variability for the entire population shows a steady increase from the unmixed Negro value of 3.36 to the NWW, more White than Negro, value of 7.31.

To test this hypothesis, the fraternal variability was computed, first for separate series, and then for the combined series, according, first to 3 per cent, then to 6 per cent, and finally to 12 per cent differ- ences in the pigmentation of the parents. As it has previously been shown that there is no difference between the sexes in the matter of N pigmentation, no attention was paid to whether the father or mother in any given family was the darker parent, but only to the difference to the nearest per cent between them. As the observational error of the original measurements is 3 per cent, the variability in steps of 6 per cent (Table XII) gives a clearer picture of the actual relationship between the differences in parental pigmentation and the variability of the offspring. Except for minor deviations, due to the small number of cases, there is an increase in variability of offspring within the family as the difference between the parents increases. If the differences are taken in groups of 12 per cent, the increased variability becomes even more consistent and striking. Again, if the Mendelian hypothesis is to hold, the variability of the offspring of parents of approximately the same percentage of N pigmentation should increase as the amount of racial heterogeneity of the parents. The Negroes in the middle ranges of N, being theoretically more heterozygous, should produce more variable off- spring than either the very light or the very dark. To test this hypothesis, those parents within 6 per cent of the same percentage of N were taken as of the same color. The upper third (67 to 90 per cent) of the entire pigmentation range of 22 to 90 per cent was designated as dark; the middle third (45 per cent to 67 per cent) as medium; and the lower third (22 per cent to 45 per cent) as light. The fraternal variability for these classes as thus determined does not conform to theoretical expectations, but decreases consistently from the lighter to the darker Negro parents. The behavior of the fraternal varia- bility in these cases is very difficult to interpret. There is no bias in the method of pigmentation measurement which could tend to make the variability less in the lower percentages of N than in the higher, but instead the greater accuracy in distinguishing small differ- ences in the per cent of N in the black sector in the lower ranges prob- ably would tend to make the variability less. With the deficiencies of our present data, we cannot offer any tenable theory by which to reconcile the increasing variability from darkest to lightest Negroes</page><page sequence="37">Inheritance of Pigmentation 357 with a Mendelian hypothesis. These data do however show the inapplicability of any theory of blending inheritance in the pigmen- tation of the American Negro.

Previous analysis would lead us to expect that the offspring of parents who fall into the same class would be less variable for the dark group, and most variable for the light group. If Mendelian dominance of N pigmentation is assumed, then when parents fall into different groups, the variabiUty might be thought to be somewhat less when one parent is in the dark group than if neither is, and less if one is medium rather than both light. Table XIV gives the fraternal variability of offspring for fathers of different groups according to whether the mother was dark, medium, or light. These same data may be rearranged to give the variability of offspring of mothers of different groups according to whether the father was light, medium, or dark. The variability of all offspring of either father or mother becomes greater from the darker to the lighter group, regardless of the pigmentation of the other parent. For any given group father or mother, the fraternal variabiUty becomes greater according to whether the other parent is dark, medium, or light. The greatest variability in all groups is 10.20, where both parents . are light; and the least is 3.80, where both are dark. The agreement with general Mendelian theory in this aspect of the results is very close, except that again we should expect the variability of the off- spring of medium parents to be greater than that of the offspring of light parents. Summarizing, the results of a consideration of fraternal variability in the various groups comprising this sample of the American Negro population show that the variability of offspring with the families increases : 1. With larger amounts of white intermixture. 2. With greater differences between the percentages of N pigmenta- tion of the parents. 3. With increasingly smaller percentages of N for parents of the same color. 4. With increasing lightness of the darker parent of the family. 5. And, for any given color parent, with the increasing lightness of the other parent. The theoretical significance of this behavior of the fraternal varia- bility, taken with the phenomena disclosed by the use of averages and regression lines, is puzzling. Before this point is discussed, it may be of value to consider the variability of the family Unes within the general population, and the relation of this variabiUty to the fraternal variabiUty for the same groups.</page><page sequence="39">Inheritance of Pigmentation 359 Family variability may aid in analyzing the process of inheritance, for in a population in which there has been recent crossing, family lines would differ considerably among themselves if segregation in hereditary traits were manifesting itself, while in racially homogeneous populations or those in which there has been long continued intermix- ture, family lines would all have practically the same ancestry and hence would have a low variability as among themselves. Since the variability of the total population and of the fraternities 4 within the families has already been computed, the variability of the family lines themselves need not be computed directly, but may be secured by the formula: S = ±V&lt;r2 - Sf2 where s is the family variability, &lt;r the total variabihty, and S / the fraternal variability.46 The total, family, and fraternal variability for each genealogical class are given together in Table XV to facilitate comparison. The variability of family lines is in all cases greater than the fraternal variability; that is, the variability between families is greater than the variability within the families themselves. And, just as total and fraternal variability, family variability increases as the amount of white intermixture becomes greater.

Since the difference between these comparative variabilities in pigmentation and the reverse comparative relationship found in Herskovits' Harlem series for other traits does not pertain directly to the subject of this study, only a rather tentative explanation will be made. If family variability is greater than fraternal variability, then, in a population in which the larger amount of racial intermixture took place some generations back, it would seem that the great mass of individuals must be selecting mates with somewhat near, though not necessarily the same as, their own percentage of N pigmentation. If sexual selection as regards pigmentation were non-existent, and mating of Negroes of different shades as haphazard as the throwing of dice, all families would have approximately the same type of ancestry in respect to pigmentation and family variability would be slight. Herskovits' study of social selection in Harlem showed that "the darkest women . . . seem to marry men of about their own color or lighter, but the lighter women, and those not pronouncedly dark, marry men darker than themselves. "47 This produces a curvilinear relation- ship between the pigmentation of husbands and wives. In the family groups comprising the four series of this study, the average percentage of N of the lighter parent increases as the average percentage of N of the darker parent becomes greater. The regression coefficient of lighter on darker parents, regardless of which sex is the darker and which the lighter, is 2.36 per cent per 3 per cent group width. The other traits measured by Herskovits are not those on which social selection has come to be based,48 and hence there would tend to 47 Herskovits, M. J. Social Selection in a Mixed Population.

Doubtless a more thorough analysis of this point would be profitable, but no further digression is pardonable here. In conclusion, total, family, and fraternal variability show essen- tially the same tendency to increase as the intermixture of white increases, being least in the N, or unmixed Negro, and usually greatest in the NWW, which is more white than Negro. Family variability is greater than fraternal variability, which indicates that there is greater variability between families of the population than within the families themselves. The known heterogeneity of racial origin and a tendency to selective mating as seen in the regression line of lighter on darker parents when taken together help to explain the relationship of the variabilities to each other. Their significance as indicating the method of inheritance will be discussed later. POSSIBLE DOMINANCE OF N PIGMENTATION In any popular discussion, and in many scientific ones, it is either asserted or tacitly assumed, that the greater N pigmentation of the Negro is dominant to the lesser N pigmentation of the white. But whether the offspring tend to approach more nearly to the pigmenta- tion of the darker parent than to the lighter is difficult to analyze when dealing with the heredity of a trait obviously complex and not subject to experimental breeding. If one parent has a greater percentage of N pigmentation than the other, then, assuming an infinite number of children, the average of the children should be nearer the pigmentation of the darker parent than the lighter if N pigmentation is dominant. The only way to test this in human material is to deal with families in the mass. All families were divided into six classes according to whether both parents were dark (over 67 per cent N) ; one dark and the other medium (45 to 67 per cent N) ; one dark and one light (under 45 per cent N); both medium; one medium and one light; or both light. The average percentage of N for the fathers, mothers, and offspring of these various types of crosses is given in Table XVI. Here the indications of dominance are slight. For the dark by dark mating, the average percentage of N pigmentation of the offspring is less than that of either parent; for the light by light it is greater; and for the medium by medium almost exactly intermediate between the two parental averages. The dark by medium and the medium by light</page><page sequence="42">362 Human Biology give the offspring midway between the average value of the lighter and darker parental averages. The dark by light cross, which is by far the most significant from the standpoint of displaying dominance, gives an offspring much nearer the dark than the light parent, as with the average of the darker parents 75.17 per cent, and the lighter 38.96 per cent, the average of the offspring is 60.99 per cent; 22.03 per cent above the lighter parent and only 14.18 per cent below the darker.

This is essentially the same method of attack as that pursued by the grouping into dark, medium, and light except that it deals with percentage differences, and not mass classification. All families in which the parents were within 12 per cent of each other's percentage of N pigmentation were grouped as against those in which the differences were over 12 per cent. Treating the average percentage of the lighter parent and offspring in each frequency group of darker parent as equal, regardless of the number of families involved, there is no difference in the average resemblance of offspring to the two parents when the latter are within 12 per cent of each other. Where the differ- ence is over 12 per cent, there is a slightly greater resemblance to the darker parent.</page><page sequence="43">Inheritance of Pigmentation 363 Parents within Parents over Average of 12 per cent 12 per cent Darker Parents 62 . 00 per cent N 66 . 50 per cent N Lighter Parents 57 . 16 per cent N 45 . 33 per cent N All Offspring 59 . 53 per cent N 57 . 26 per cent N Difference Darker Parent and Offspring -2.47 per cent N - 9.24 per cent N Difference Lighter Parent and Offspring +2.37 per cent N +11.93 per cent N Here is a slight indication of dominance, but since the offspring are only 2.6 per cent closer to the darker parent where the difference is over 12 per cent, and since this is only slightly over 10 per cent of the total difference between the parents, it offers no conclusive evidence except as it may add some slight additional validity to other indications of dominance. In conclusion, the resemblance to the darker parent is greater than to the lighter if the difference between the parents is over 12 per cent; or if the mating is one of a dark Negro (over 67 per cent N) to a light Negro (under 45 per cent N). All that we are justified in saying is that perhaps pigmentation is dominant in inheritance, but if so, multiple factors must be postulated to explain the very slight evidences obtainable by the various ways in which the data were manipulated to detect greater resemblance to the darker parent. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DAVENPORT'S DATA Since Davenport's original data for the families used in his study are published in his memoir, The Inheritance of Skin-Color in Negro- White Crossesj Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication No. 188, material was available to use as a control on the series of measure- ments utilized in our own study. Davenport's field workers made measurements by the use of the Bradley Color Top on Jamaica, Bermuda, and Louisiana families, but as only two of these, the Jamaica and the Bermuda, were made by the same field worker, they alone were used for comparative purposes. The families for Davenport's study, unlike our own, were selected as representing certain types of crosses and hence contain much more non-Negroid blood than the general average of the American Negro population. They consist largely of Fi and F2 crosses; the American Negroes of today are largely Fs and later. Davenport used his data in the uncorrected form, assuming that the ox-blood red corresponded to the haemoglobin of the blood, and</page><page sequence="44">364 Human Biology that therefore any addition of the approximately 59 per cent black in the red to the readings of the percentage of black would be invalid. In this study, as explained in the introduction, we have worked on the assumption that the four percentages are quantitative readings which, blended, match the skin, with no implications as to their necessary correspondence to any specific component parts of the skin. Accordingly all Davenport's readings were corrected by subtracting 59 per cent of the red reading for each individual and adding it to the black in order to obtain a figure representing the total black of the blend that matches the skin, and hence comparable in this respect to our own measurements. The data as thus corrected were analyzed in the same way as our own, the results of which analysis we can only summarize briefly.

As the precise ages were not given for all adults, all individuals over twenty were put into the general class of adults. Means and standard deviations were computed for the Jamaica and Bermuda Series separately, showing no consistent difference between either sexes or series, so all individuals of an age were combined and the means and standard deviations computed for age groups. The means for these various ages were smoothed by the use of a three-year running average of the means, and an ideal curve drawn to fit the data (Table XIX). There is a steady increase in pigmentation to the age of 9 or 10, and then a steady decline to adulthood.

Fraternal Variability increases with increasing differences in the pigmentation of the parents, and, when the parents are of approximately the same color, with less percentages of N. Davenport's data are thus in substantial agreement with our own and subject to the same interpretation. THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ANALYSIS Thus far the facts have been presented with almost no attempt at an analysis of their theoretical significance in regard to the heredi- tary mechanisms involved in producing the type of resemblance of parents and offspring which has been shown to exist. The negative eliminations are far easier than the positive analysis. The N, which may conceivably represent the amount of melanin pigmentation of the American Negro, is not inherited as a blend, using the word in the sense of a fusion of hereditary characteristics without a segregation in later generations. Both the regression coefficients and the fraternal variability make this explanation tenuous. If there were a blend, the variability of the offspring of parents of approxi- mately the same percentage of N would tend to be very slight, and what variability there was, due to environmental influence, would be practically the same regardless of the comparative lightness or dark- ness of the parents. The fact that the variability of the offspring of parents of the same percentage of N pigmentation increases with the increasing lightness of the parents is irreconcilable with any theory of blending inheritance yet the average of the children of parents in the middle ranges of pigmentation, from about 50 per cent N to 69 per cent N, is usually within the same 3 per cent group as the average of the pigmentation of their father and mother. The problem is to account for this appearance of a blend which cannot be a blend if the regression coefficients and expressions of fraternal variability are valid. Neither is pigmentation inherited according to the simple one- factor Mendelian mechanism. Assuming there were a factor for N pigmentation which behaved as a Mendelian dominant, then there should be concentration of numbers at some percentage of N represent- ing the dominant NN, the heterozygote Nn, and the recessive nn, with . many more cases of the dominant, the precise number depending on the amount and type of intermixture which has occurred. But if we examine the frequency distribution, there is in all series and in the</page><page sequence="54">374 Human Biology combined series a monomodal curve, with concentration of numbers in the upper ranges. Again, how could we account for the fact that there is consistency in the change of the average pigmentation of children with a 3 per cent frequency distribution of the increasing average pigmentation of their parents, their fathers, or their mothers, if the germ class of an individual could only be of the combination NN, Nn, and nn, where N represents the factor for N pigmentation, and n either the recessive factor or the absence of the dominant N? And if the frequency groups in the middle ranges represent the Nn heterozygote, with N only partially dominant, then how shall we explain the fact that the average of the offspring coincides so nearly with the average of the parents? If two Nn marry, then the expecta- tion would be INN, 2Nn, and Inn, which, though when averaged might give the appearance of an entire Nn population, certainly could not have a lower variability than the offspring of two individuals, both of whom have a small percentage of N pigmentation, and hence theoret- ically are nn and so can have only nn offspring, or perhaps are Nn and nn, and so have J^Nn and % nn offspring? This procedure might be continued indefinitely, showing the futility of the application of a one factor Mendelian explanation to our data. Simplicity of explana- tion is perhaps desirable when possible in scientific work, but obviously here we have a complex phenomenon, and one not resolvable into a black X white equals black which when mated with black inter se produces 3 black and 1 white, no matter how much the underlying phenomena may be obscured or modified by environmental conditions. Practically the same objections may be urged against the two factor Mendelian explanation as against the one factor. It is too simple an explanation to fit the phenomena when all facts are taken into account. There is no trace of concentration in the frequency distri- bution at certain percentages which might correspond roughly to the individuals having the various genetic compositions. Davenport found such concentration in his Bermuda series, but when his own data were corrected for the black in the red and for age changes, this concen- tration disappeared. To repeat, all the curves, for all series and for all genealogical classes, are essentially monomodal. Two factors can no more account for the consistency of change between parents and off- spring, or fathers, and mothers and children, than can the one factor hypothesis, unless we posit a very great environmental influence on pigmentation which obscures the distribution which the genetic com- position of the individuals would otherwise produce. But if we posit</page><page sequence="55">Inheritance of Pigmentation 375 this, then we are admitting the invalidity of any study of the heredity of pigmentation which is based 031 measurements of the color of individ- uals. The consistency of the differences between genealogical classes in all types of manipulation of the data argues against sufficient envi- ronmental influence, either external or internal to the individual, to obscure the working of whatever hereditary mechanisms are involved. Again, in a two factor hypothesis, how could one explain the fact that the variability of the offspring of two light parents is greater than that of the offspring of parents in the medium range whose genetic composition must be more heterogeneous? The two factor Mendelian hypothesis is insufficient to explain all the facts. Can one posit Mendelian heredity, with its independence of genes or factors, their segregation and later recombination, in any form as holding for the inheritance of pigmentation in the American Negro? What are the criteria by which Mendelian inheritance in any popu- lation may be recognized, disregarding for the moment the question of the precise analysis of the number and type of factors involved, and their mutual inter-relationships? If two races diverse for any particular trait inter-breed, then the hybrid offspring must show a greater variability in regard to that trait than either parent race. Theoretically the point of greatest racial heterogeneity should be the most variable in respect to any trait in which there are decided differ- ences as between the races. Does this criterion of Mendelian inherit- ance hold for the N pigmentation of the American Negro? Both fraternal and family variability increase as the amount of white intermixture increases, but the point of greatest variability is in most cases the group nearest the white race and not the one of the greatest racial heterogeneity. In the fraternal variability by series we find the following results, which offer many complications difficult to interpret. In Series I, II, and III, the variability in the NW group is greater than in the NNW, which conforms to expectations; but in the NW in Series IV, the variability is less than in the NNW, which is nearer the Negro race. However, since Series IV has so few families in both the NNW and the NW, no great importance may be attached to this slight point. In Series I and III the variability is greater at the point of greatest racial mixture, the NW, and less in the NWW. In Series IV the NW and the NWW are practically the same, while in Series II there is great discrepancy. This series, it will be remem- bered, was measured by King and corrected to make it comparable with the measurements of Herskovits. Considering the possible</page><page sequence="56">376 Human Biology inaccuracies in the genealogies, and the fact that the dual correction for age changes and the personal factor in measurement may have introduced some errors, Series I, to which the others were corrected, may give a more valid picture than the combined series. If it does, then Mendelian expectations are fulfilled. Fraternal Variability Genealogical Class All Series Series I II III IV N (Both Parents) 3.36 2.90 3.41 4.05 2.73 N (One Parent) 7.12 4.43 6.02 9.61 3.45 NNW 6.19 5.65 5.93 6.76 5.92 NW 6.99 6.94 7.10 8.68 4.61 NWW 7.31 6.69 12.23 6.58 4.66 But when one turns to the total variability of the various series, it is in Series I and II greater in the NWW than in the NW; and in Series III and IV less. In Series II and IV, it is greater in the NNW- than in the NW, and in Series I and III less. In the combined series, total variability, except for a slight decline in the NW, increases as the increase of white inter-mixture. The trend here, as in fraternal variability, appears to be a consistent increase with increasing admix- tures of white, rather than with increasing racial heterogeneity. Total Variability Genealogical Class All Series Series I II III IV N 8.93 5.50 7.85 11.51 4.63 NNW 11.21 8.98 12.39 10.49 10.41 NW 11.12 9.88 12.32 12.37 8.91 NWW 12.35 10.78 14.60 11.89 7.62 Total 13.02 11.61 13.33 12.75 10.91 In the division of the total population into groups of dark, medium, and light, the latter, while probably nearer the white group and thus representing less racial mixture than the medium, is in all cases the most variable. The combined series indicate greater variability in both the NWW and the NNW than in the NW, the most racially heterogeneous. Even granting that there might theoretically be an increase of variability with dominance of N, the difficulty of recon- ciling the behavior of these variabilities with Mendelian theory is very great. But if there is Mendelian inheritance, the variability of the off- spring should increase with increasing differences in the pigmentation</page><page sequence="57">Inheritance of Pigmentation 377 of the parents. This is undoubtedly true of our data, the increase being persistent if differences are taken in 12 per cent groups. If the parents are of the same percentage of N pigmentation, the variability of the offspring of parents of the higher percentages should be least, those of the medium greatest, and those of the light less again. In our data, the variability of the offspring of dark parents is least, that of the medium group greater, but that of the light group greatest. This greater variability of the offspring of lighter parents, nearer the white race, and hence theoretically both homozygous for more réces- sives and probably heterozygous for more of the dominants, is an enigma similar to the greater fraternal variability in the NWW in the majority of cases. Thus there are some indications that the inheritance of pigmen- tation does follow those mechanisms we call Mendelian. Yet can Mendelism explain the regression found for the average values? Here it must be remembered that we are dealing with means, either of parents or children as the case may be, and that individual variations are hidden or obscured. A family in which there are two children of 60 per cent N will give the same average figure for offspring as if the children were 40 and 80 per cent N respectively. When the average of the parents is from 45 to 67 per cent N, the average per- centage of N of the offspring generally falls within the same 3 per cent group as that of their parents, and yet the fraternal variability of the offspring of parents within this same general percentage group is 5.54. When the average percentage of N of the parents is high, say over 67 per cent, the average of the offspring is less than that of the parents, and the fraternal variability only 3.84; where the average of the parents is low, say under 45 per cent, the average of the offspring is higher than that of their parents, and the fraternal variability 9.43. When we pierce the regression, based on mean percentages, of any given group of offspring on parents, we find the variability to conform somewhat to Mendelian expectations. Can we assume that quantitative Mendelian heredity is in operation and explain the phenomena of regression? In an attempt to do so, it is necessary to enter far into the realm of theory. Suppose we assume that pigmenta- tion is due to several factors which behave as Mendelian dominants. Most of those individuals who have high percentages of N pigmen- tation will be heterozygous for one or more of the factors for N. When two individuals mated who, though outwardly dark, are heterozygous for the factors involved, their offspring would have a</page><page sequence="58">378 Human Biology smaller percentage of N pigmentation on the average than the mean pigmentation of their parents. The difficulty practical breeders face in " breeding up" for any particular trait in the production of which multiple factors are involved, illustrates the same type of phenomena. On the other hand, when the average of the parents in under 45 per cent N, one parent is usually darker than the other, as was shown by Herskovits in his analysis of social selection in the American Negro population. Hence on an assumption of Mendelian dominance of the factors for N, the average of the offspring would be a higher percentage of N than the average of the parents. Thus, given freedom to make a sufficient number of subsidiary postulates, Mendelism could explain the averages of children for various percentages of N of the average of the parents. The behavior of the averages of offspring for various percentages of fathers and mothers taken separately can be made to appear Mendelian by the same type of logic. Since very dark indi- viduals marry persons somewhat lighter than themselves, and very light individuals persons somewhat or much darker, then if pigmen- tation is produced by one or more Mendelian dominants, the offspring of dark fathers or mothers would tend to be lighter, and those of light fathers or mothers darker. As would be expected under this hypothesis, the regression coefficient on either fathers or mothers is less than the coefficient on the mean of the parents. However, the validity of this extremely tenuous type of logic is very questionable. Given the liberty to make a sufficient number of assumptions, a skillful logician could make the results we have secured conform to practically any theory of heredity. The fact that the regression is greatest for the unmixed Negro group, and becomes less for the NNW and NW is in accord with Mendelian expectations, as the offspring of any racial group resemble their parents more than do the offspring of parents who, representing racial mixture, are heterozygous for the factors involved in many cases. But how shall we explain the fact that the NWW, a group racially more homogeneous than the NW, has a less coefficient of regression? Perhaps the N pigmentation of the American Negro is a case of Mendelian inheritance, but, if so, it is a complex kind which defies analysis in a human population. Popular mores and the necessary length of time involved prohibit controlled breeding experiments which might give results at all comparable with those obtained in the lower plants and animals. That variability increases progressively as the intermixture with the white race shows either that we are dealing with a</page><page sequence="59">Inheritance of Pigmentation 379 faulty technique of pigmentation measurement and biometrical analy- sis, or that there is here something in inheritance which no present theory of inheritance can explain on the basis of the data which we have available. If it be multiple factor Mendelism, then we have as yet no perfected technique for analyzing either the number of factors involved or their behavior in relation to each other in a human population. We have arrived at an impasse where only deductive logic or hypotheses which defy verification by our present methodology remain. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS The general conclusions of this study of the method of inheritance of the pigmentation of the American Negro may be stated as follows: 1. There are no sex differences in N pigmentation. 2. The percentage of N pigmentation of the American Negro increases quite rapidly until puberty, with a maximum at the age of 15; decreases rapidly until about the age of 35; and then decreases very slowly the remainder of life. 3. The frequency distribution of all series, and for each genealogical class, is monomodal, with no concentration at points which might indicate Mendelian genetic combinations. 4. The average percentage of N pigmentation of offspring shows regression to the mean pigmentation of the group, the regression coefficient of offspring on parents (in 3 per cent groups) being 2.43; on fathers, 1.48; and on mothers, 1.84. 5. Both total variability, and its component family and fraternal variabilities, tend in general to increase with increasing intermixture with the white race, being greatest in the group genealogically nearest the white race instead of in the group racially most heterogeneous. 6. Fraternal variability increases with increasing differences between the percentages of N pigmentation of the parents. 7. Fraternal variability of the offspring of parents of the same percentage of N pigmentation is greater the less the percentage N of the parents. 8. Offspring resemble the parent with the greater percentage of N (the darker) slightly more than the one with the less percentage of N (the lighter). 9. Pigmentation is not found on analysis to be inherited by blend- ing, nor is it produced by the action of one or two factors which act as Mendelian dominants. Whether it may be interpreted through</page><page sequence="60">380 Human Biology the hypothesis of multiple factors, and, if so, how many factors may be postulated, is not subject to determination from our data by any technique which we know at present.
