Who after all will sort out all these nuances? ?Robespierre, On the Principles of Revolutionary Government1 In the midst of the terror, Robespierre here conjures up and then abandons those nuances that usually disappear in divine wrath. Some thing ofthat wrath was appropriated in June of 1794 when the Conven tion officially recognized the existence of the Supreme Being, a typical republican sacralization. Political catechisms and hagiographies, Pan theonized glory, celebratory masses for Reason, patriotic fesivals?all infused the revolution with religious emotion for citizens who had known no other than Catholic sacraments (see cover and Fig. 1). The Terror, however, was a strange, symbolic regression. Other forms of religion could be mocked or republicanized. But the Terror, invoked to protect the Revolution, seemed to turn society backward, conjuring up an ancient instrumental fear that had been, during the previous century, attributed only to savage gods.2 i.

MANIQUIS After the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, philosophical polemics, of which Candide (1759) was only one brilliant example, disarmed the optimistic idea that natural catastrophes were all for the best. Philosophy was soon called upon again to confront the Terror, which seemed to be a moral catastrophe as incongruous with human reason as destroying cities was with divine mercy. Divine wrath, by rationalist principles, had always been only the sacralized projection of human violence. But until the French Revolution it was not for humanity to declare itself the source of its own terror. Some writers, of course, were content with an ancient wild justice, invoked by satanic Jacobins who were finally crushed by truly divine wrath?as in Gillray's French giant, exploded by the heavenly lightning of God and British naval power (see Fig. 2).3 Popular in caricature and the newspapers, this providential theme was elaborately developed in anti-revolutionary French Catholicism. There were also, to be sure, republican Christians, like Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, an illumin? who celebrated the Revolution as the incarnated word, with that chi liastic thrill common between 1789 and 1815. Out of Joanna Southcott's English womb Shiloh, the Second Messiah, was to have emerged in 1814, only a decade or so after the French had worshipped the Virgin Mary as a patron saint of Liberty and Jesus as the first sans-culotte. Between these extremes of revolutionary and anti-revolutionary Chris tians, others saw in the Revolution both Sin and Grace, a fortunate fall necessary to those desperate spiritual revivals of the kind theorized by (io June 1794), which officialized State violence already in effect since 6 April 1793, when the Revolutionary Tribunal was established. These separate events and official acts are often strung together to imply that the Revolution was terrorist from the beginning or that its culmination was the Jacobin Convention, the first modern totalitarian government. These tendentious ideas have been most recently popularized in Simon Schama's Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989). Detailed and general studies of the Terror number in the many thousands. For modern "Jacobin" and Marxist discussions of the Terror, see the works of Albert Mathiez, Albert Soboul, Claude Mazauric. For a different view, see the article and bibliography under the entry "Terreur" in Fran?ois Furet and Mona Ozouf, Dictionnaire critique de la r?volution fran?aise (Paris: Flammarion, 1988). The analysis in the eighteenth century of religious terror is also the object of dozens of intellectual histories. For a convenient summary of the issues involved see Frank Manuel, The Eighteenth-Century Confronts the Gods (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1959) and The Changing of the Gods (Hanover, N.H. and London: UP of New England, 1983). 3.

Like religious optimists before them, however, they usually found light amidst the darkness. Condorcet wrote his Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progr?s de Vesprit humain (1793) in hiding, where he would die (perhaps by suicide), pursued to the end by the Jacobins. Neither the September massacres of 1792, nor the High Terror of 1793, nor his own persecution shook his faith in progress toward the virtuous human community. William Godwin in 1789, several years before his Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793), in which he warned against all violent revolution, immediately distinguished the passions of the "multitudes" from that which he desired: "... such political changes only as should flow purely from the clear light of the understanding, and the erect and generous feelings of the heart. "5 Whether Christian or rationalist, explanations of the Terror abounded, and even a brief account of their variety?from Catholic maledictions to philosophic meditations?would overflow these pages. Some expla nations of violence had already emerged in the eighteenth-century shift from theodicy to psychology and anthropology. The attack on Leibniz ian optimism, from the late 1750s on, centered attention on psycholog ical projections in universal terror, while terror had been historically traced, since the seventeenth century, in well-known accounts of the Spanish conquistadors by Las Casas, Garcilaso de la Vega, and later by Marmontel. These factual and legendary reports often described human sacrifice in native American rituals, examples that, along with religious horrors of the Egyptians and Assyrians, would find their way into 4- On the revolutionary cults of the Virgin Mary and the illuminisme of St. Martin, see David G.

MANIQUIS philosophical attacks on the vestigial cannibalism of Hebrews and Chris tians.6 But these accounts also described a constancy of racial extermi nation, war, and atrocities, confirmed as well throughout Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-88). European history often seemed a mnemonic grid of great exterminations from the massacre of the Albigensians to the ever-repeated horrors of St. Bartho lomew's Night?memories commonly invoked in liberal reaction to the Terror. If St. Bartholomew of 1572 could be read in the guillotining and massacres of 1793, then the Terror became only regression and less a fatal interruption of enlightened progress.7 And yet we know that the Terror produced a sense not of something old, but of something new. Carlyle would insist, in 1837, that the Terror was something for which history had no name: "... what if History were to admit, for once, that all the Names and Theorems yet known to her fall short? That this grand Product of Nature was even grand, and new, in that it came not to range itself under old recorded Laws of Nature at all, but to disclose new ones?" Forty years after the Terror, Carlyle fit this new historical thing to his ontological Yeas and Nays, christening Terror as "transcendental despair" to be answered in the spiritual progress of hope.8 But the long romantic reaction to the Terror, which ended in Carlyle and Dickens and began with the writers I shall emphasize here?Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge?had little effect in submerging the Terror in dystoles and systoles of organic rhythm or 6.

References to Saint Bartholomew bristle in speeches at the Convention, political pamphlets, and throughout nineteenth-century French historiography and literature. The Terror is often portrayed as a counter-St. Bartholomew or even as final dissipation of the religious instinct to massacre. One of the most famous is that in Victor Hugo's Quatre Vingt-Treize m: 3, or in Contemplations, where Hugo, after comparing the two violent moments says "Les R?volutions, qui viennent tout venger, Font un bien ?ternel dans leur mal passager" (v: 3).

On the contrary, in the last two hundred years, the Terror has been ideologically simplified into an L/r-form of modern political violence. The reactions of Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge began in the political fray. But effects of the Terror upon them appear most dramat ically in their poetry, which often speaks of violence untranscended, in images of the poet himself falling sadly silent. In poetry, sacramental exchanges of death for life, which replaced terror with hope, were threatened from all sides, dislocated by violent revolution and a Euro pean war waged almost continuously from 1792 to 1815. There was also a growing darkness in social thought that joined the Terror in its cultural effect. The publication, for instance, of Thomas Malthus' An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) caused nearly as much intellec tual shock as the Terror, and all romantic writers reacted vehemently to it. Malthus specifically brings the Terror into his demographic theories, while criticizing the optimism of Condorcet and Godwin, whose ideas, so he argued, were not so much false as irrelevant. Far from anthro pomorphizing the Terror with either divine or evil human will, Malthus de-psychologizes and de-humanizes violence in an internecine social mass mechanically ruled by sex and hunger. As Marilyn Butler suggests, catastrophic changes in scientific narratives provided patterns of deep time against which perhaps even the Terror could fade into evolutionary processes. Transforming political violence, along with plagues and fam ines, into natural shifts certainly provided a congenial scientific parallel to social meliorism.9 English romantic forms of the idea, however, lie somewhere between eighteenth-century rational and nineteenth-century scientific optimism, as we see in Coleridge's version of violence leading to good: "Without advocating the exploded doctrine of perfectibility, we cannot but regard all that is Human in Human Nature, and all that in Nature is above herself, as together working forward that far deeper and more permanent revolution in the Moral World of which the recent changes in the Political World may be regarded as the pioneering whirl wind and storm."10 But the Malthusian appearance of such processes (as far as the romantics could see in the 1790s) brutally transformed history into only material history.11 9- See the preceding essay, "Telling it Like a Story: The French Revolution as Narra tive.

MANIQUIS The Malthusian shock, in the oddest way, suggested a return to the subjection traditional Christians saw in divine extermination, except that the extermination had become mere periodic self-adjustments of the social mass. The dark implications of these ideas romantic poets always repelled. From The Prelude (i795-1850) to Prometheus Unbound (1820), wherever there are revolutionary floods, earthquakes, and volcanoes, there is also insistent human will. Sometimes adjusting human will to historical progress was awkward. Coleridge, writing in the margins of the Essay on Population, accused Malthus of confused moral views in thinking that European expansion could not proceed by exterminating other peoples: "If it be immoral to kill a few Savages in order to get possession of a country capable of sustaining a 1000 times as many enlightened and happy men, is it not immoral to kill millions of Infants and Men by crowded Cities, by Hunger, and by the Pox?"12 It would be silly to conclude much from a remark designed only to make a telling point against Malthus. Still, it is always morally awkward to suggest that one kind of collective murder is better than another. Malthus forced his readers into such moral awkwardness, one reason why readers like Coleridge abhorred his book. Poetry, of course, needs more moral nuance than is to be found in marginal scribblings. The presence of universal human good would have to be traced in that which Words worth constantly refers to?undercurrents of beneficent tendency, "something" running below, something "more deeply intertwined" in history. But tracing those lines also went on as the rationalist dismantling of anthropomorphic terror grew into its logical extension, the anthro pological dismantling of humanism. Wordsworth's intertwinings of the human and the natural were already becoming, in the larger culture, dark entanglements. Cultural and moral contradictions, of course, did not bring romantic writing to a halt. Sometimes the contradictions simply disappeared into journalistic tub-thumping for the British Empire. Southey, De Quincey, and Carlyle, for instance, had little trouble turning their attention from revolutionary violence in Europe to the productive use of violence else where. But romantic writing during and just after the Revolution is 12. Quoted by Percy Waldon Long in "Unpublished Marginalia in Coleridge's Copy of Malthus' Essay on Population," PMLA 51 (1936): 1062. Kenneth Curry points out that some of the marginalia in this copy of The Essay on Population, 2nd ed. (now in the British Museum) was written by Coleridge with a view to helping Southey prepare a review for the Annual Review and that some of the marginalia is Southey's. What I have quoted, however, sounds very much like Coleridge, though whether he or Southey wrote it, the historical and moral points remain the same.</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 373 painfully self-conscious of its moral dilemmas. Caught between human ist and materialist ideas, the romantic poet, after the Terror, attempts sacramental gestures in a new order of aesthetic imagination?unfortu nately, just when the imagination was about to be decentered and the moral voice of poetry drowned out in vast, imperial noise. II I would not willingly kill even a flower, but were I at the head of any army, or a revolutionary Kingdom, I would do my Duty. ?Coleridge13 The general reaction to the French Revolution in Great Britain is often reduced to one scenario. Sympathetic British witnesses hailed it in 1789, condemned it after the September Massacres in 1792, and abandoned it with the so-called Great Terror of 1793 to 1794, when disillusionment turned sunshine revolutionaries into gloomy reactionaries. All this is not so much false as too simple. Without a doubt, progressive reformers like Samuel Romilly were joyous in 1789 and shocked in 1793: "The French are plunging into a degree of barbarism which, for such a nation, and in so short a period, surpasses all imagination. All religion is already abolished; and the next proceeding will undoubtedly be a persecution as severe and as unremitting as any that has taken place in the darkest ages."14 And young radical poets like Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey did become middle-aged reactionaries. But what many wrote, at least as political explanation of the Terror, is neither shrill nor panicky. From 1792 to the 1840s sympathy for the plight of the French as a people forced into horrors was commonly expressed. Coleridge, Southey, Wordsworth, Blake, and later Shelley and Hazlitt were relatively re strained in their reactions after 1793. Robespierre, though often com pared to Cromwell, had of course not yet acquired the satanic features assigned to him later as the supposed ancestor of Stalin and Hitler. Robes pierre and the Terror were, for many English writers in the 1790s, repul sive but explainable, and explanation had a way of cushioning shock.15 13- The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed.

MANIQUIS The common portrayal of the Terror as an explosive result of oppres sion is one Wordsworth repeats in The Prelude when he insists on un derstanding "the reservoir of guilt / And ignorance, filled up from age to age, / That could no longer hold its loathsome charge . . . ,"16 when he suggests that the French, mired in "ignorance and immaturity," needed only the light of "one paramount mind" to put a stop to their barbarism (x. 176-88). Their revenge he does not simply condemn. Saddened and depressed by this stain upon revolutionary ideals, he returns to England, where he undergoes his greatest depression. Like Coleridge, Thelwall, Godwin, Paine, Kant and others, Wordsworth suggests that the Terror was not really the fault of the French but of the British. As England set itself against France, he was himself filled with anger against the reactionary spirit that intensified the Terror: In France, the men who for their desperate ends Had plucked up mercy by the roots were glad Of this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before In devilish pleas, were ten times stronger now, And thus beset with foes on every side, The goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of few Spread into madness of the many; blasts From hell came sanctified like airs from heaven. (x. 306-14) Far from mysterious, at least in these lines, the Terror for Wordsworth had clear historical causes that go far towards, if not a defense, at least a distanced account of why the French became madly violent. Nevertheless, these lines from The Prelude are tame compared to Coleridge's Condones ad Populum, in which the common English radical theme is also taken up: it was the antipathy of England and Prussia towards France that caused the worst horrors: ... in this inventory of guilt as the immediate and peculiar effect of the present War, and justly attributable to our Ministry, we must ideas to those of such other radicals as Godwin and Thelwall; he also makes useful comparisons between Wordsworth's and Coleridge's attitudes toward Robespierre.

They forget that this fear of extermination was exactly what French revolu tionaries and sympathizers feared in reactionaries. The young radical Coleridge fervently believes this as he points in France to the "bloody fanatics," created by the policy of the initiating English Terror. It was common in the 1790s to turn the word terror around upon Britain; Godwin does as much in a preface to Caleb Williams (2nd edition, 1796), where he uses the word as if it could only refer to British repression.18 In countering this British terror, Coleridge the preacher sermonizes in the typical biblical language of dissenting radicals: . . . Hunted on all sides, insulted by unceasing and brutal menaces, they felt the blended influence of terror and indignation?by the first they were impelled to become voluntary slaves to the bloody fanatics, whose wild energies seemed alone proportionate to the danger; by the latter their gentler feelings were suspended, and the military spirit with all its virtues and all its vices seized at once a whole nation.

"(72-73) Biblical authority and political necessity converge in the French Terror, and indeed all revolutions, Coleridge asserts, may need to "dissolve the ordinary ties of morality. " His moral condemnation is filled with sym pathetic understanding: "I mean not to imply approbation of such sys tems of morals: but doubtless the Terrorists . . . knew that the general consequences of their actions would be evil, but they thought the oc casion so vast and pressing, as to make the particular good consequences overbalance the general evil ones?especially as those actions could never be imitated in after times with any shew of reason, unless in the rage and tempest of some future Revolution" (73). In support of this argu ment he quotes from his and Southey's play The Fall of Robespierre (1794). What he quotes suggests, in its dramatic context, revolutionary fanaticism, but in the foil of Coleridge's radical attack, the same words become a reasonable argument for justifiable violence: Are not the congregated clouds of War Black all around us? In our very vitals Works not the king-bred position of rebellion? Say, what shall counteract the selfish plottings Of wretches, cold of heart, nor aw'd by fears Of Him, whose power directs th'eternal justice? Terror? or secret-sapping gold?

(73, [1.147-60]) The continuous political Terror that horrifies Coleridge less in France than in its source comes from the deep hostility to all that was progres sive. As he builds to his sermonic climax, Coleridge exploits images of French violence in England of the 1790s, popular in caricatures of French sans-culottes drinking blood and chewing on human flesh?all this is turned back upon the British and on that satanic figure, Pitt: terror intoxicates more than strong wine; with the which, who forcibly drenches another man, is the real cause and sole responsible agent of all the excesses, which in the hour of drunkenness he shall</page><page sequence="13">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 377 have committed. . . .

(74) Coleridge's Unitarian distaste for the Eucharist made it easy for him to associate British savagery with sacraments sliding back into savage or igins. Recalling eighteenth-century rehearsals of horror, he reaches back to the behavior of the British in America, where, he says, they hired Indians and tended to turn into savages and cannibals themselves. The language is familiar from Reflections on the Revolution in France, in which Burke describes black masses of revolutionary cannibals. Both Coleridge and Burke, like most radical and conservative, revolutionary and anti revolutionary writers, participate together in the same cultural dissolu tion of sacramental order, portraying in each other a new yet ancient violence beyond any order of meaning. The world, in this revolutionary moment had left the domain of moral nuances?all writers seem to agree. And one of the common ways they mark it is to play upon one of the grand tropes of the day?humanity cannibalizing itself.19 Years later in his The Life of Napoleon (1828-30) Hazlitt would rehearse the same and many more explanations of the Terror; though disdainful 19- Steven Blakemore discusses Burke's use of popular cannibal imagery in Burke and the Fall of Language: The French Revolution as Linguistic Event (Hanover, N.H.: UP of New England, 1988) 39-41. Ronald Paulson discusses the cannibal image in Representations of Revolution (1789-1820) (New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1983) passim, but see especially the analysis of Goya's cannibal images 376-77. Alan Liu touches upon this subject in Wordsworth: The Sense of History (Stanford: Stanford UP, 1989) 138-63. Liu's chapter on "the poetics of violence" is a partial mapping of the rhetoric of violence during the French Revolution. Liu keeps from falling into "Romantic ideology," (as defined by Jerome J. McGann), but there is more than a trace of more important contemporary political ideology in his description of French revolutionary language as "totalitarian poetics" (159). The cannibalism and sacrifice themes and images of violence during the revolutionary period do need to be extended much farther than they have been into analysis of the themes of totality, extermination, and genocide. But the analysis must also include the ideological use of these themes in the historiography of the Revolution, Freudian theory, and recent general theories of sacrifice in the works of Ren?e Girard, Jean-Pierre Vernant, and others. I have presented several papers on aspects of this subject (one of which Liu kindly cites), that will form part of a larger study of these issues.</page><page sequence="14">378 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS of the "effeminate" French, he refuses to grant the Terror any special historical status. His analyses of French revolutionary violence are, like the young Coleridge's, exercises in accepting political aggression and defense. Hazlitt continued to invoke a rough Realpolitik in defending the French long after Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey had fallen away into Toryism. Hazlitt also underlines the belief that the Revolution was particularly violent and savage because the French were Catholic: Perhaps a reformation in religion ought always to precede a revo lution in the government. Catholics may make good subjects, but bad rebels. They are so used to the trammels of authority, that they do not immediately know how to do without them; or, like man umitted slaves, only feel assured of their liberty in committing some Saturnalian license. A revolution, to give it stability and soundness, should first be conducted down to a Protestant ground.20 Nothing like the young Coleridge's radical invective erupts here, but Hazlitt makes a similar point about contagious blood-thirst, translated from English radical dissent into more restrained liberal disdain. He is emphasizing national traditions of authority, but his comparison also depends on Protestant psychological clich?s about the Catholic sacra ment. Eucharistie consumption, along with a "slave" mentality are closely allied with Saturnalian license and blood-letting; French Catholics run amok in revolution because something primitive has for centuries run amok in their superstitious minds. By the time of Hazlitt's The Life of Napoleon, however, in the late 1820s, the linguistic explosion of revolutionary and anti-revolutionary pamphleteering had ended. Un derstatement and irony were sufficient. Byron was never short of anti clerical vitriol, but in describing the shipwreck scene of Don Juan and Pedrillo about to be cannibalized, all he needs is a brief, ironic touch to suggest the savage core of sacrificial death: He died as born, a Catholic in faith, Like most in the belief in which they're bred, And first a little crucifix he kiss'd, And then held out his jugular and wrist.21 The ironic reference recalls the Enlightenment theme of vestigial vio lence, themes that Byron can brilliantly play with just as he plays, again 20.

For poets like Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge, however, in the political heat and linguistic explosion of the Revolu tionary decade, irony was no consolation in their earnest search for symbolic transformations of blood into a vision of purposive Nature. Those transformations only became harder to make as writing in the 1780s and the 1790s continued the Enlightenment dismantling of the old sacrificial order. Goethe aligns sacrificial imagination under a holy sav agery in Iphigenia (1787); Blake, in The Mental Traveller (1800-1804), demonstrates the dull mental round of sacrificial violence; in his political lectures Coleridge locates a social savagery of revenge in, what he calls, using Bacon's phrase, mere "wild justice" and a sacrificial instinct gone wild.22 Again and again, writers identify exhaustions of the symbolic exchange of death for life. After a century of both rationalist attack and the gentle spirituality of deism, some dismantling of mystery and terror was easy. Blake confidently turns an angry patriarchal God into his toothless Nobodaddy. Thomas Jefferson simply took his scissors to the New Testament, cut out all its offensive primitivism, and glued together what was left into a personal moral guide.23 But the writing of The Prelude or The Four Zoas or Le G?nie du Christianisme or Prometheus Unbound could not be cut and pasted if art was to transform old into new sacramental forms.

MANIQUIS historical and psychological explanations of the Terror in The Prelude, there are also haunting lines on the September massacres unmediated by an explanation or by any symbol: Through months, through years, long after the last beat Of those atrocities, the hour of sleep To me came rarely charged with natural gifts, Such ghastly visions had I of despair And tyranny, and implements of death; And innocent victims sinking under fear, And momentary hope, and worn-out prayer, Each in his separate cell, or penned in crowds For sacrifice. . . . Then suddenly the scene Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me In long orations, which I strove to plead Before unjust tribunals,?with a voice Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense, Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt In the last place of refuge?my own soul. (x.399-415 [1850]) This world of violence is neither juridical, nor sacrificial, nor apocalyp tic. The tribunals are unjust, those to be sacrificed, which is to say murdered, are gathered like animals in pens, and there is nothing lying before the poet; he can only draw back in a naked confrontation with himself. Such moments are common enough in romantic dream ac counts, where the self gazes upon the self, when as in Coleridge's dreams or De Quincey's nightmares the man-God of Christological imagination is split in two and becomes both the "idol" and the "priest, " the sacrificer and the sacrificed.25 Such moments cannot be endlessly repeated; they are too psychologically radical. Wordsworth expanded the 1850 version of this passage, in order to deepen the sense of empty despair; this is the mind collapsed to a symbolic zero point. Justice has become a savage revenge grown ghastly. The sacrificial hope of finding in a symbolic exchange some sense of life in death is dissolved by indiscriminate massacre. From that point on, all that can be done is to imitate the sacramental process by which violence is transformed into something else. 25- The Collected Writings of Thomas De Quincey, ed. David Masson, 14 vols. (London, 1896-97) in: 442-43.

This is violence we remember from Macbeth, z spreading of evil and blood. It is also like the mere animal intensity of a child: . . . They found their joy, They made it, ever thirsty, as a child? If light desires of innocent little ones May with such heinous appetites be matched? Having a toy, a windmill, though the air Do of itself blow fresh and makes the vane Spin in his eyesight, he is not content, But with the plaything at arm's length he sets His front against the blast, and runs amain To make it whirl the faster. (x. 3 36-45) The poet remarks an inadequacy in his similes and while setting them forth, he also retreats from them. Can indeed the "light desires of innocent little ones" be compared to what he also describes as "heinous appetites?" Yet there is method in this poetic coyness, for having re membered the violence of the Terror in one frightening moment of self confrontation, Wordsworth, as we shall see, turns that history back into imagined innocent moments of youth, when all such transformation of violence seems unnecessary. When he describes "eternal revenge" in hearing of the death of Robespierre, it is not surprising to see Wordsworth typically enveloping the violent reaction, even his sense of vengeance, in descriptions of Nature seeming to absorb all calmly into itself. But it is important to see that in remembering how he heard of Robespierre's fall, Wordsworth describes nature enveloping two stages of the past. The first comes in the established eighteenth-century trope of the ruin. Wordsworth's evo cation of the mass celebrated in a "ruined chapel" has nothing harsh in it. As with all his ruins of churches and abbeys, there is even something of nostalgia here for the kind of sacramental, and hence communal, order it represents. Yet it is, after all, a ruin, an empty space where once that communal symbolization, however primitive, worked its power "in ancient times." These two historical disappearing forms?a superseded sacramental order and a barbarous figure of violence?are presented already embedded in time as memory and even the chapel "like a sea rock" is run into continuous lines with Nature:</page><page sequence="18">382 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS Without me and within as I advanced All that I saw, or felt, or communed with Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small And rocky island near, a fragment stood? Itself like a sea rock?of what had been A Romish chapel, where in ancient times Masses were said at the hour which suited those Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide. Not far from this still ruin all the plain Was spotted with a variegated crowd Of coaches, wains, and travellers, horse and foot, Wading, beneath the conduct of their guide, In loose procession through the shallow stream Of inland water; the great sea meanwhile Was at safe distance, far retired. (x. 515-29) The religious vocabulary of his social memory is insistent. He "com muned with" all that he sees and feels around him. The "variegated crowd" is caught in motion and only just linked, in their time, with the memory of those in the past who came for sacramental communion in their time.26 When he hears of Robespierre's death, it is as if the news will be received and dissolved into this communal and communing world: ... I paused, Unwilling to proceed, the scene appeared 26. Carolyn Springer discusses this passage in "Far From the Madding Crowd: Words worth and the News of Robespierre's Death," in The Wordsworth Circle xn (1981): 243 45. She emphasizes that the chapel "has gradually come to merge with the surrounding landscape and to assume more primitive, natural, eternal forms ..." and comments that "in its eternal, archaic form Wordsworth hopes to repossess this shrine, as he will the Biblical imagery of Exodus, for the purpose of celebrating a specific political and historical victory." Surely this is correct, as long as we also emphasize that the chapel is, indeed, abandoned; if it is an emblem, as Springer says, of "the harmony of man and nature," that harmony can occur once that chapel is a thing of the past and only "like a searock." Wordsworth's repossession of the chapel is not a reinvocation of its sacramental order, at the center of which is sacrificial violence no longer possible in his ultimate sense of harmony between man and nature. It is interesting to compare the 1850 and the 1805 descriptions of the ruined chapel. The later version drives it even more obviously into the past by describing it even more as virtually a natural thing. See also Alan Liu's interesting discussion of Wordsworth's "denial of history," in The Prelude, Wordsworth: The Sense of History 359-454 and James K. Chandler's Wordsworth's Second Nature: A Study of the Poetry and Politics (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1984).</page><page sequence="19">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 383 So gay and cheerful?when a traveller Chancing to pass, I carelessly inquired If any news were stirring, he replied In the familiar language of the day That, Robespierre was dead. Nor was a doubt, On further question, left within my mind But that the tidings were substantial truth? That he and his supporters all were fallen. Great was my glee of spirit, great my joy In vengeance, and eternal justice, thus Made manifest. 'Come now, ye golden times', Said I, forth-breathing on those open sands A hymn of triumph. . . . (x. 529-43) This brilliant setting of the scene allows him to speak revenge and to call down "eternal justice" with, of course, little chance of confusing this mild invocation of divine terror with the kind he remembers in the Terror, when "blasts of hell" came "sanctified like airs from heaven." Wordsworth sometimes revised his poetry into tortuous nuance in order to make this kind of distinction. In the 1805 version, for instance, where he speaks of spiritually sur viving the "evil times" of those "enormities," he remembers the "wrath of Heaven," which gave him "Something to glory in, as just and fit, / And in the order of sublimest laws." These feelings "amid the awe / Of unintelligible chastisement" gave him "a kind of sympathy with power" (x.401-16). The 1850 revision of these lines, however, reveals how such feelings have also made him uncomfortable. This sense of the "sublimest laws" leads him to hope arising from "affliction." But it also suggests to him an awkward complicity from which, in the 1850 version, he disentangles himself. In 1805, the prophets are "enflamed" with vaguely defined "consolations" and "majesty of mind." In 1850, the prophets are "borne aloft / In vision, yet constrained by natural laws / With them to take a troubled heart." They are no longer "enflamed" in 1850, but moved by a "creed / of reconcilement. " The most interesting revision of all qualifies the expression "sympathy with power." This becomes "sympathies with power, " the plural form weakening the identification with sublime vengeance, diffused even more by defining this "power" as "motions not treacherous or profane, else why / Within the folds of no ungentle breast / Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged?" He distinguishes his feelings, these "motions" and their enduring "dread vibration" from both the "treacherous and the profane." He participates</page><page sequence="20">384 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS in the moral opposition to the Terror, while also carefully distancing himself from violence projected into God and history, the kind he sees in "glimpses of retribution, terrible" (x.437-60 [1850]). These are intri cate lines, in which Wordsworth twists and turns to escape treacherous and simplifying violent oppositions. His hearing of Robespierre's death in a landscape, where there is a happy crowd and a ruined chapel, is typical not only of Wordsworth's attempt to negate both historical violence and vast, opposing "terrible" retributions. That religious-social-natural?and personal?memorial scene both absorbs and distances the religious sacraments of the past. Only in such a prepared scene can he pronounce without any troubling complicity what is only a form of that which, in another circumstance, became madness in the Terror?the wild justice of revenge. This scenic circumstance, however, dissipates any sense of violence even in personal thoughts of vengeance; he is poetically exculpated from historical vio lence just as the textual revisions we have seen put a distance between him and any complete poetic identification with the "retribution, terri ble." He goes on talking about how the Revolution will actually proceed, how great hopes are still to be realized, but he brings all of history back to the memory of boyish joy, running swiftly past two historical mo ments of the past, one symbolized by the Romish chapel (associated with still another "mouldering fane"), and the other, by Robespierre: Thus, uninterrupted by uneasy bursts Of exultation, I pursued my way Along that very shore which I had skimmed In former times, when, spurring from the Vale Of Nightshade, and St. Mary's mouldering fane, And the stone abbot, after circuit made In wantonness of heart, a joyous crew Of schoolboys, hastening to their distant home, Along the margin of the moonlight sea, We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand. (x. 557-66) As Time and Nature move forward, the recent, revolutionary violence and the previous monuments of sacrificial ceremony are absorbed into nature as they are absorbed into the poet's own memory, interrupting (but only just interrupting) the joy of the moment and the expectation of the future. Historical transformation is finally enveloped here in the personal remembrance of a time before violence, an innocence when all energy was only "wantonness of heart. " It is tempting to describe this</page><page sequence="21">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 385 as sublimation, which suggests a completed psychological process and a poetic closure, and such passages do imitate poetic memory completely embracing pleasures, violence, and even past sacramental form. But Wordsworth also keeps a radical memory of unmediated violence con stantly open in his poetry, imitating sacramentalism but never disguising those moments when symbolic exchanges of death for life are unper formed and closure impossible. We mystify organic form and narrative catharsis if we think that a carefully designed historical forgetting erases what the poet insists are often remembered fractures. It is hard to forget that moment when Wordsworth puts us close to the desolation of mas sacre. . . . Then suddenly the scene Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me In long orations, which I strove to plead Before unjust tribunals,?with a voice Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense, Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt In the last place of refuge?my own soul. (x.409-15 [1850]) The poet confronts a kind of radical violence as if for the first time, as if the violence has no mediation. This is rather different from those "spots of time" in Book xn and others, when death, the signs of murder or brutality, or a brutalized soldier are suddenly come upon and then, as if inevitably, linked by memory to other restorative images. Memories of the Terror are spots of time never quite absorbed. They begin as symbolically empty places in time that then abound in conflicting images and colliding senses of evil and providential violence. The dreadful memories of isolation in the midst of the historical moment of the Terror need not be collapsed into one Freudian primal scene, nor need we imagine primordial violence transformed by the poet into some other, hidden story.27 Recurring memories and dreams of the Terror are of violence untransformed; part of their powerful effect is in their trans parency leading to nothing beyond itself. In such moments an imagi native impasse is emblematized in the self set immediately before what is finally a de-symbolized violence. Something ofthat feeling of coming upon violence, as if for the first time, apprehended without any symbolic 27- Ronald Paulson offers one of the many Freudian readings; in this one Wordsworth, Robespierre, Louis xvi, and Wordsworth's father are connected together in what would have been Wordsworth's obviously very crowded subconscious. See Paulson, Represen tations 269 ff.</page><page sequence="22">386 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS mediation, is there in the description of the September massacres of 1792: I thought of those September massacres, Divided from me by a little month, And felt and touched them . . . (x. 64-66) Feeling and touching massacres, Wordsworth goes on to say, is mixed with "tragic fictions," "remembrances," "dim admonishments," but it is the feel and touch of unmediated violence that throws him into an eery state of perdition where symbolical transformation has disappeared. Obviously none of this produces permanent despair. As we have seen in the passages on Robespierre, Wordsworth finds ways both to engage and to extricate himself from a dialectics of violence, and to see hope always arising out of its opposite. But these moments are, even in their isolation, frightening in the halt they bring to all connection. Even Blake, a poet of enthusiastic prophetic violence, records a mo ment of such fracture in America: A Prophecy when he hesitates before the terror in his own mythopoeic world?an unusual but a revealing moment for Blake?when the poet grows silent. America we can take certainly to be as much about the French Revolution and the Terror as it is about the American War of Independence; Blake treats the American uprising as if it produced apocalyptic violence, all couched in the lan guage of religious prophecy?fire, blood, plagues, and pestilence. He thus radicalizes the American Revolution, displacing political violence of the years 1793 to 1795 into metaphorical violence, what Erdman calls "prophetic terror."28 Blake speaks in 1793 of terror that could have no other historical referent than the actual terrors of revolutionary France. Ore is, of course, biblically terrible. In his original awakening in the sexual embrace with Urthona, he is born in a wrenching of the world. And as a political force he is: ... a Human fire, fierce glowing, as the wedge Of iron heated in the furnace; his terrible limbs were fire With myriads of cloudy terrors, banners dark &amp; towers Surrounded: heat but not light when thro' the murky atmosphere. The King of England looking westward trembles at the vision.29 28. See David Erdman, Prophet Against Empire (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1954) 264. 29.

Plates hereafter cited in the text.</page><page sequence="23">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 387 At the beginning of Plate 8, Ore is a terror that can simply declare itself: "The terror answered: I am Ore." All these references are common stuff in the rhetorical tradition of Hebrew and Protestant prophecy. Its lan guage antedates all contemporary revolutionary violence and is derived not only from the Bible but from a long line of prophetic histories.30 And yet it is impossible to ignore the fact that America was several times printed during the worst of French revolutionary violence and the worst of English reactionary oppression.31 It is a poem of those years when real violence directly mirrored prophetic violence, when history challenged the poet to absorb its violent moment in his mythopoeic system. We also cannot ignore those lines, in the Preludium, when the Bard momentarily stops his poem even before it begins. Just after Ur thona completes her song in recognition of Ore: "This is eternal death: and this the torment long foretold," we read: The stern Bard ceas'd, asham'd of his own song; enrag'd he swung His harp aloft sounding, then dash'd its shining frame against A ruin'd pillar in glittring fragments; silent he turn'd away, And wander'd down the vales of Kent in sick &amp; drear lamentings. (Plate 2) Why does the Bard dash his harp against a ruin'd pillar? Despite his transformative imaginative system of contraries of existence, is there a violence untransformable by the poet's song? "Silent he turn'd away," we are told, turning his back upon his song only to lament. The lines are not easy to interpret, especially since they are almost always masked and only twice printed by Blake himself, though it is not at all clear what determined Blake to print or not to print them. As G. E. Bentley, Jr. puts it, "Were these pessimistic lines part of Blake's first complete version of the poem, confidently omitted in most printings of the poem, or were they a gloomy addition, made after the hopes inspired by the French Revolution had been destroyed by Napoleon and by the English government?"32 And if the lines were present very early but masked between roughly 1793 and 1799 (as Bentley shows), why were they etched at all? Critics have a wealth of suggestions: Blake was pessimistic 30. See Erdman, for instance, on Joshua Barnes' History of Edward m (1688) in Prophet Against Empire passim. 31. On dating the composition of America, see W. H. Stevenson, "The Shaping of Blake's 'America,'" Modern Language Review 40 (i960): 497-503. 32.

Bentley's essay is a careful analysis of the printing and the masking of the Bardic lines in all extant copies.</page><page sequence="24">388 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS in the mid-1790s at the turn of violence in the French Revolution; or he was disappointed that the American Revolution, not radical enough, left British and continental tyranny in place; or he was pessimistic, like other radicals, at the growing weakness of their movement and the power of the English "terror." Interpretations like these, and their variations, suggest that the specific reasons for Blake's pessimistic lines will prob ably never be determined.33 But their fundamental significance lies in the plainest evidence. That he is "ashamed" of his own song, we may attribute to poetic hyperbole. That the song is at least sometimes imag inatively halted by Blake's own text suggests a scar usually removed, but always there to be hidden on the etched plate. In this confrontation with his own poem, the poet does not simply speak of a poetic difficulty; he walks out of its frame, "down the vales of Kent" as if away from the poetic moment into real historical time. After marking that break, he must then of course proceed, suppressing that early etched-in doubt through most of the mid-i790s. Later he again unmasks that doubt and twice prints the lines even before plunging forward once more with prophetic terror. America leads finally to a vision of peace and love, of sensuous and communal unity, arrived at through the prophetic but now also dangerous tropes of terror painfully reified by the very actors upon the historical scene in which the poet finds himself. Danton, Robes pierre, and Marat also used a prophetic vocabulary of blood, pestilence, plague, and terrors, similar to Blake's, for this was, indeed, common language. They would have used that language even if there had never been an officially established Terror. But there was such a Terror and such traditional biblical phrases cannot help but be painful in a new sense when spoken in the echo of violence in the new State, almost immediately expanded by Napoleon into an even more massively violent empire. How could Blake, to use a phrase of David Erdman, combine "proph etic terror with pursuit of the main chance?" One answer to this question is that he could not. Though some critics read this as an optimistic, 33- Among those essays and interpretations, see, in addition to the pages on America in Prophet Against Empire, his "America: New Expanses" in Blake's Visionary Forms Dramatic, ed. David V. Erdman and John E. Grant (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1970) 92-114; Minna Doskow argues the not terribly convincing case that the Bard smashes his harp because he is disappointed with the American Revolution in "William Blake's America: The Story of a Revolution Betrayed," Blake Studies 8 (1979): 167-86; David James explains the relations between material and imaginative history in a helpful way in "Angels out of the Sun: Art, Religion and Politics in Blake's America," in Studies in Romanticism 18 (1979): 235-52.</page><page sequence="25">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 389 others as a pessimistic poem, it only makes sense poetically as ambivalent prophecy, a poem partially self-fragmented. We underestimate Blake's humanity and his intelligence when we assume that he reacted little to Robespierre, to the Terror, or the general violence of the long European war, because he simply drew them into his system of contraries and played cruel violence out between Energy and Reason. Blake was noth ing if not poetically self-confident, but he was never blithe or bumptious. As Erdman points out, Blake would never again "write such precisely dated prophecies as America and Europe. When Blake had 'called all his sons to the strife of blood' he had simply no idea how that strife would sear the inlets of the soul both in France and in England. "M There is at times an agony in Blake as there is in Wordsworth, glimpsed rarely, as in America, but which is nevertheless part of a contradiction between poetry and history that has nothing to do with contraries. Indeed, it was because ofthat real contradiction that an imaginative system of contraries was necessary. And yet Blake's prophetic terror, the most powerful in all English romantic writing, elaborates itself into a linguistic implosion. The dif ficulty of the later books has many causes, but one of them is their multiple transformations of violence into imaginative process of which the natural world is always only a trope. The later books are not unlike the circling inward of mythical redemption in Faust 11?the more his torically and psychologically inclusive these poems become, the more difficult they are to read. Blake's shaping of terror and death with fragile displacement of religious and ordinary language is, at the same time, part of its brilliance, evident even in his simplest lines. If the "cut worm forgives the plow" (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell), we sacramentalize and psychologize the natural process; we agree to speak as poetry always has?with pathetic fallacies. We can also think the lines literally, rather than speak their imitation of sacrament, and insist on natural process in which the worm's forgiveness of the plow obviously makes no differ ence at all. Such a vulgar, Malthusian interruption of poetic prescription emphasizes the fragility in romantic sacramentalizing of natural?and historical?process. Like Wordsworth's use of the term communing with, designed both to invoke and dismiss old sacraments, the word forgives lies between the romantic imagination and the world as a memory of past sacrificial violence. If we drive the word forgives too far into natural process, it loses even this particular connotation, like the word sacrifice, in the midst of indiscriminate, terrorist violence turned into only another 34- Erdman, Prophet Against Empire 264-65.</page><page sequence="26">390 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS word for death or destruction or the anonymous enveloping of matter within matter. Romantic poetry commonly gestures with such sacra mental words by which an imaginative order graces a natural or histor ical order of violence. But in this poetic gesture, the imaginative word is also constantly challenged not to dissolve into that which it tries to endow with significance. In 1798, nearly four years after his spirited analysis of the Terror, Coleridge published "France: An Ode," a poem about revolutionary France now drifting into its historical role as imperial aggressor. Like Blake, Coleridge could still summon prophetic biblical language to speak against tyranny and as his anger against France grew, in poems like "Fire, Famine and Slaughter" (1798), he calls down lightning and earth quake with old poetic thunder.35 But in the same year he also published The Rime of The Ancient Mariner, a poem set in opposition to prophetic terror, a poem about violence and its symbolic transformations. When the Ancient Mariner recounts how he let the arrow of his cross bow fly and murdered the albatross, we are thrust into violence as yet untransformed and un-symbolized. The poem is the imagination of a pure act of violence before interpretation, not yet fitted into discourses of symbolic exchange. No other literary work in English literature so strikingly portrays violence stripped to such naked phenomenalism? portrayed as a mysterious act and a call to the mind to understand. The poem dramatizes how an original violence is turned into significance, filtered through discretely separable acts of interpretation, complicity, revenge, and a self-conscious repetition of sacrificial exchange that, as a form of imagination, is ultimately transcended. The crew members, witnesses to violence, communally decide at first that the violence was bad and then that it was good, becoming as the Gloss tells us, "ac complices in the crime";36 like Europeans confronting the Terror, the crew is a community of interpreters. The Ancient Mariner is no simple allegory of revolutionary violence, but it does poetically concentrate the pervasive question of intellectual complicity in European reactions to the Terror. This cosmically tiny, yet ontologically giant act of killing the albatross seems to occur without purpose or meaning. As the sailors become not only witnesses but implicated actors in the scene of violence, they confer meaning upon it and suffer extermination in their complicity. 35- C. G. Martin makes a good case for dating this poem December 1797. See "The Dating of S. T. Coleridge's 'Fire, Famine and Slaughter,'" Notes and Queries, New Series 19, No. 8 (August 1972): 289-90. 36.

Hereafter cited in the text as CPW.</page><page sequence="27">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 391 An image of sacrificial death, symbolized in the albatross hung like a cross from the Ancient Mariner's neck occurs at the center of the poem. There everything turns around?from a world filled with interpretation, judgment, punishment, and sacrificial symbol to a world devoid of all determinate sacrificial meaning. Like the ruined chapel Wordsworth emphasizes in The Prelude, a sacramental place remembered with respect, even nostalgia, but dissolving into time, the sacrificial sacrament imi tated in the hung albatross, must also be got beyond?in an act of love imagined without any primitive memory of necessary violence at its center. When that act of love is complete, the albatross falls from the Mariner's neck and the sacrificial memorial of violence falls away. The framed narrative of The Ancient Mariner provides the perfect distancing from this most self-conscious of all romantic poems about the mythic imagination of violence. Like the Bard in Blake's America who, just for a moment, turns away from his own poem silenced and sad, the Wedding Guest is unforgettably silenced by the story. But the Wedding Guest is not both a sadder and a wiser man because the violence witnessed and all its subsequent?and disastrous?transformations have left him with any new symbology. He has only the injunction to love; in the poem, it is only by a thaumaturgie act of love that both violence and its sacrificial sublimations are got beyond. Yet Coleridge himself thought that injunction an inadequate issue out of the poem's symbolic complexity. The Wedding Guest stands outside just as the Mariner is inside his own story, doomed always to repeat his story from that zero point of initial, violent fracture, setting it again and again before another listener for reinterpretation. The different orders of violence?massive violence of the French Revolution and the killing of a seabird?do not make this poem any less a poem of the revolutionary 1790s, when the interpretation of violence was a dominant political and psychological topic. The Ancient Mariner simply pushes to the extreme moments like those we have seen in Wordsworth and Blake?moments of void from which all meaning must then be reconstructed. In the notebooks and letters, Coleridge often returned to The Ancient Mariner, as if it were an exemplary text to reflect upon continually. Its themes can be followed forward into Coleridge's meditations on politics, society, and religion. Among those reappearing themes is the idea of a communal complicity in those interpretations and symbolizations which instrumentalize violence. That concern appears in an 1817 apology for his 1798 poem, "Fire, Famine, and Slaughter." Coleridge recounts a conversation he had in the presence of Sir Humphrey Davy and Sir Walter Scott and other unnamed friends. Scott had come upon "Fire, Famine, and Slaughter, " a bloody poem indeed, published anonymously</page><page sequence="28">392 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS in the Morning Post in January of 1798. Scott read it aloud to the assem bled company and afterwards Coleridge's host, William Sotheby, com mented that whatever the merits of the poem, "they could not have compensated for that malignity of heart which could alone have prompted sentiments so atrocious." The charge was cruel, but obviously Sotheby thought the poem was too. Shaken by the remark, Coleridge noticed that Humphrey Davy (the only other person in the room aware of the author's identity) was also made uncomfortable. Coleridge sum moned up, he says, "presence of mind enough to take up the subject without exciting even a suspicion how nearly and painfully it interested me" (CPW11.1097-1108). He then recounts what he said in 1798 to the charge of thinking cruelly and what he has since thought about the subject, quoting himself in passages from The Friend in 1810. The real subject of the Apologetic Preface to Tire, Famine, and Slaughter' is the contamination of metaphoric by historical terror. Coleridge essen tially says his violent language was just a way of speaking; it did not indicate his actual sentiments. We are reminded here of Wordsworth's revisions of those 1805 lines on "enflamed" prophetic wrath which turn into guiltless glimpses of the Terror and "terrific" retribution. Like Wordsworth, Coleridge extricates his poetic violence from its context of historical violence: "Could it be supposed, though for a moment, that the author seriously wished what he had thus wildly imagined, even the attempt to palliate an inhumanity so monstrous would be an insult to the hearers" (CPW 11.1098). Coleridge surely sensed the impli cation in this defense?that every intelligent reader knows that this is only poetry. That implication, however, would undermine Coleridge's idea that, in one sense, the poetic imagination is everything. Hence he takes the defense very seriously: "... it seemed to me worthy of con sideration, whether the mood and the general state of sensations in which a poet produces such vivid and fantastic images, is likely to co-exist, or is even compatible with, that gloomy and deliberate ferocity which a serious wish to realize them would pre-suppose" (CPW 11.1098). After carefully building up psychological distinctions, he goes on to defend writers and poets of the past, as if the contamination he must defend against, in this historical moment, can be too easily projected back even upon them. Dante, Jeremy Taylor, Milton, those who spoke with ter rible imprecation of the imaginary horrors of eternal justice, should not be imagined, Coleridge insists, as devoid of "humanity, or goodness or heart" (CPW 11.1103). He even feels obliged to distinguish Milton's violent seventeenth-century republican language from any "modern" associations with revolutionary violence: "Milton became more and more a stern republican, or rather an advocate for that religious and</page><page sequence="29">ENGLISH ROMANTICISM AND THE TERROR 393 moral aristocracy which, in his day, was called republicanism, and which, even more than royalism itself, is the direct antipode of modern jacobinism" (CPWn. 1105). Coleridge is arguing against unnamed critics who, he suggests, see in poets of the past a horrifying complicity they could never have intended. The poet protests too much. That he must distinguish between bar barous intentions and his metaphors indicates the deep effect upon a writer in a culture whose violence can no longer be contained in coherent symbolic form. His defense of himself is historically specific. His defense of his poetic predecessors is a defense of all poetry in the face of history. If this defense was truly necessary in 1817, then how could poetry ever achieve again that imitative prophetic power Coleridge, along with Blake and Wordsworth, admired in the example of Milton? How could the mantle of the prophetic poet be worn comfortably if the romantic poet had to point out that Milton's seventeenth-century republican wrath was not proleptic Jacobin excess? To be obliged to remind readers, at a time of vicious violence, that a poetry of violence is just a way of speaking implies that poetry had already lost one of its ways of speaking. In these romantic hesitations, silences, and self-conscious gazes by the poet at his own language we read intimations of the complicity that Kant suggested rational beings were historically obliged to feel. Kant's word for this complicity was enthusiasm, which comes in witnessing a great event, the welling up of good feeling that became a self-affirming sign of the righteousness of the Revolution: The revolution of a gifted people which we have seen unfolding in our day may succeed or miscarry; it may be filled with misery and atrocities to the point that a sensible man, were he boldly to hope to execute it successfully the second time, would never resolve to make the experiment at such cost?this revolution, I say, nonethe less finds in the hearts of all spectators (who are not engaged in this game themselves) a wishful participation that borders closely on enthusiasm, the very expression of which is fraught with danger; this sympathy, therefore, can have no other cause than a moral predisposition in the human race.37 Coleridge, as we have seen, argues generally the same idea when he says the Revolution was the "pioneering whirlwind" of "more perma nent revolution in the Moral World. " What Kant, however, emphasizes 37- The Conflict of the Faculties (Der Streit der Fakult?ten), trans. Mary J. Gregor (New York: Abaris, 1979) 153.</page><page sequence="30">394 ROBERT M. MANIQUIS also is complicity with the total idea of the Revolution and, however imaginative, a morally dangerous complicity with its means. Despite the danger, Kant says, and all the bloodshed, humanity enthusiastically welcomed the Revolution, because, ultimately, humanity always means well. Coleridge suggests, in explaining "Fire, Famine, and Slaughter," that, despite their violent metaphors, the poets too always mean well. To be obliged to say that is sad and also revealing of where the poet most intensely feels moral complicity?in language itself. Certain forms of linguistic complicity are never gotten over. Though history and a thundering public voice continue to metaphorize violence (we speak today even of a balance of terror) the best of poetry after the Revolution never significantly recovers its ability to form prophetic terror or co herent images of sacrificial order. In this sense, the Terror is deeply imprinted in the rest of nineteenth-century English poetry. Kant says that the French Revolution was "never to be forgotten" because it was an undeniable tendency to human improvement. Nine teenth-century writers indeed never forgot the French Revolution?both its hope and the challenge its violence posed to the imagination. Shelley remembered the Revolution in one way in 1809 as he translated, with revolutionary glee, the bloodiest lines of La Marseillaise. He remembered it differently as he planned Hubert Cauvin, a tale (never to be written) about the failure of the French Revolution.38 And he remembered it, in still another way, when in Prometheus Unbound, he would have to start all over again (like Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge before him) and portray social imagination as a denial especially of the replicating vio lence of vengeance and sacrifice. It is not too much to say that the Terror affected the imagination of all violence in poetry. In 1818, Keats speaks of the "shapes, and shadows, and remembrances" of things "all disjointed" from a bust of Voltaire to Hazlitt to images of ancient sacrifice stopped in the aesthetic time of a painting. He tells also of looking "too far into the sea," and "into the core of an eternal fierce destruction, " one that he can only chase from his mind, for this is a violence for which he has no philosophy, no system, no language, no transforming images.39 Though this particular "core of an eternal fierce destruction" is far removed from guillotining and massacre, Keats's intellectual nakedness here is typical of his post 38.

Nineteenth-century English poetry was often left in the lurch of what Keats calls these "horrid moods," memories of violence that he can make no sense of. In these moods, most subsequent poetry also stopped rehearsing romantic sacramental gestures, and by the 1840s it was no longer interesting to dismantle, as the romantics did, ancient sacramental order. On the contrary, a poet like Tennyson tried to call up, though only as failing reminiscence, the old sacramental order and images of Christian resurrection, as if somehow they might imaginatively work once more. Modern poetry is filled with desperate revivals of such symbolism as we come full circle in Lawrence's primitivist fascination with ancient Mexican gods or Eliot's anthropologically-laden sadness in The Wasteland. The body buried in the garden of that poem will always be just a body in the garden that will never rise again. What I have described here is only a part of romantic poetry, which is also celebratory and filled with confident joy. Reactions of the English romantic poets to the Terror are, however, revealing of something disintegrating in the cultural order. Poetry could not put back together what the Revolution had begun to take apart. Romantic poets could provide few enduring images with which poets afterwards could con fidently react to history's augmenting violence. What they did leave were brilliant expressions of a sacramental failure. University of California, Los Angeles</page></plain_text>
