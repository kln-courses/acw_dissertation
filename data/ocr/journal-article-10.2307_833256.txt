<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONCERNING TIME IANNIS XENAKIS QUESTIONS CONCERNING TIME AND SPACE ISN'T TIME SIMPLY an epiphenomenal notion of a deeper reality? A lure that we have unconsciously accepted from our earliest infancy, and ever since early antiquity? We all know of the special theory of relativity and the equations of Lorentz-Fitzgerald and Einstein, which link space and time because of the limited velocity of light. From this it follows that time is not absolute. Yet time is always there. It "takes time" to go from one point to another in space, even if that time depends on moving frames of reference relative to the observers. There is no instantaneous jump from one point to another in space, much less "spatial ubiquity"--that is, simultaneous presence of an</page><page sequence="2">Concerning Time 85 event or of an object everywhere in space. To the contrary, one posits the notion of displacement. Within a local reference frame, what then does dis- placement signify? If the notion of displacement were more fundamental than that of time, one could undoubtedly reduce all macro and micro- cosmic transformations to extremely weak chains of displacement. Conse- quently (and this is an hypothesis that I freely advance), if we were to adhere to quantum mechanics and its implications, accepted now for dec- ades, we would perhaps be forced to admit the notion of quantified space and its corollary, quantified time. But then what could a quantified time and space signify, a time and space in which contiguity would be abolished? What would the pavement of the universe be if there were gaps between the paving stones, inaccessible and filled with nothing? Let us return to the notion of time considered as duration. Even after the experimental demonstration of Yang and Lee which has abolished the parity symmetry P, it seems that the CPT theorem still holds for the sym- metries of the electron (C) and of time (T), symmetries that have not yet been completely annulled. This remains so even if the "arrow of time" appears to be nonreversible in certain weak interactions of particles. We might also consider the poetic interpretation of Feynman, who holds that when a positron (a positively charged particle created simultaneously with an electron) collides with an electron, there is in reality only one electron rather than three elementary particles, the positron being nothing but the temporal retrogression of the first electron. Let us also not forget the the- ory of retrograde time found in Plato's Politicos-or in the future contrac- tion of the universe. Extraordinary visions. Quantum physics will have difficulty dis-covering the reversibility of time, a theory not to be confused with the reversibility of Boltzmann's "arrow of entropy. " This difficulty is reflected in the explanations that cer- tain physicists are attempting to give even today for the phenomenon called the "delayed choice" of the two states-corpuscular or wave-of a photon. It has been proven on many occasions that the states depend entirely on observation, in compliance with the theses of quantum mechanics. These explanations hint at the idea of an "intervention of the present into the past," contrary to the fact that causality in quantum mechanics cannot be inverted. For if the conditions of observation are established to detect the particle, then one obtains the corpuscular state and never the wave state, and vice versa. A similar discussion on nontemporality and the irreversibil- ity of the notion of causality was undertaken some time ago by Hans Reichenbach. Another fundamental experiment has to do with the correlation of the movement of two photons emitted in opposite directions by a single atom. How can one explain that both either pass through two polarizing films, or</page><page sequence="3">Perspectives of New Music that both are blocked? It is as if each photon "knew" what the other was doing, and instantaneously, which is contrary to the special theory of relativity. Now, this experiment could be a starting point for the investigation of more deeply seated properties of space, freed from the tutelage of time. In this case, could the "nonlocality" of quantum mechanics perhaps be explained not by the hypothesis of "hidden variables" in which time still intervenes, but rather by the unsuspected and extravagant properties of nontemporal space, such as "spatial ubiquity," for example? Let us take yet one more step. As space is perceptible only across the infinity of chains of energy transformations, it could very well be nothing but an appearance of these chains. In fact, let us consider the movement of a photon. Movement means dis-placement. Now, could this dis-placement be considered an autogenesis of energy, an energetic parthenogenesis of the photon by itself at each step of its trajectory (continuous or quantized)? This continuous auto-creation of the photon, could it not in fact be space? ANOTHER QUESTION The actual state of knowledge seems to be the manifestation of the evolu- tion of the universe since let us say some fifteen billion years.' By that, I mean that knowledge is a secretion of the history of humanity, produced by this great lapse of time. Assuming this hypothesis, all that which our individual or collective brain hatches as ideas, theories or know-how, is but the output of its mental structures, formed by the history of the innumera- ble movement of its cultures, in its anthropomorphic transformations, in the evolution of the earth, in that of the solar system, in that of the uni- verse. If this is so, then we face a frightening, fundamental doubt as to the "true objectivity" of our knowledge and know-how. For if, with bio- technologies already developing, one were to transform these mental struc- tures (our own) and their heredity, therefore the rules for the functioning of the brain based today on certain premises, on logic or systems of logic, and so on ... , if one were to succeed in modifying them, one would gain, as if by a sort of miracle, another vision of our universe, a vision which would be built upon theories and knowledge which are beyond the realm of our present thought. Let us pursue this thought. Humanity is, I believe, already on this path. Today, humanity has already taken the first step in a new phase of its evolu- tion, in which not only the mutation of the brain, but also the creation of a universe very different from that which presently surrounds us, has begun. Humanity, or the species which will follow it. 86</page><page sequence="4">Concerning Time IN MusIC In the following comments, the points of view on time are taken from music in gestation or under observation. This is not to say that my preced- ing comments do not concern the musician. On the contrary, if it is incum- bent on music to serve as a medium for the confrontation of philosophic or scientific ideas on the being, its evolution, and their appearances, it is essen- tial that the composer at least give some serious thought to these types of inquiry. Furthermore, I have deliberately not approached the psychological apprehension of time from higher levels, for example, the effects of the temporal dynamic experienced while listening to a symphony or to elec- troacoustical music. What is time for a musician? What is the flux of time which passes invisi- ble and impalpable? In truth, we seize it only with the help of perceptive reference events, thus indirectly, and on condition that these reference- events be inscribed somewhere, do not disappear without leaving a trace. It would suffice that they exist in our brain, in our memory. It is fundamental that the phenomena-references leave a trace in my memory, for if not, they would not exist. Indeed, the underlying postulate is that time, in the sense of an impalpable, Heraclitian flux, has signification only in relation to the person who observes, to me. Otherwise, it would be meaningless. Even assuming the hypothesis of an objective flux of time, independent from me, its apprehension by a human subject, thus by me, must be subject to the phenomena-reference of the flux, first perceived, then inscribed in my memory. Moreover, this inscription must satisfy the condition that it be in a manner which is well circumscribed, well detached, individualized, with- out possible confusion. But that does not suffice to transform a phe- nomenon that has left traces in me into a referential phenomenon. In order that this trace-image of the phenomenon become a reference mark, the notion of anteriority is necessary. But this notion seems to be circular and as impenetrable as the immediate notion of flux. It is a synonym. Let us alter our point of view, if only slightly. When events or phenomena are syn- chronic, or rather if all imaginable events were synchronic, universal time would be abolished, for anteriority would disappear. By the same token, if events were absolutely smooth, without beginning or end, and even with- out modification or "perceptible" internal roughness, time would likewise find itself abolished. It seems that the notions of separation, of bypassing, of difference, of discontinuity, which are strongly interrelated, are prereq- uisite to the notion of anteriority. In order for anteriority to exist, it is nec- essary to be able to distinguish entities, which would then make it possible to "go" from one to the other. A smooth continuum abolishes time, or rather time, in a smooth continuum, is illegible, inapproachable. Con- tinuum is thus a unique whole filling both space and time. We are once 87</page><page sequence="5">Perspectives of New Music again coming back to Parmenides. Why is space included among those things that are illegible? Well, because of its nonroughness. Without sepa- rability, there is no extension, no distance. The space of the universe would find itself condensed into a mathematical point without dimensions. Indeed, Parmenides' Being, which fills all space and eternity, would be nothing but an absolutely smooth "mathematical point." Let us get back to the notion of separability, first in time. At the least, separability means nonsynchronisation. We discover once again the notion of anteriority. It merges with the notion of temporal ordering. The order- ing anteriority admits no holes, no empty spaces. It is necessary for one sep- arable entity to be contiguous with the next, otherwise one is subject to a confusion of time. Two chains of contiguous events without a common link can be indifferently synchronous or anterior in relation to each other; time is once again abolished in the temporal relation of each of the uni- verses represented by the two chains. Local clocks serve as chains without gaps, but only locally. Our biological beings have also developed local clocks but they are not always effective. And memory is a spatial translation of the temporal (causal) chains. We will come back to this. I have spoken of chains without gaps. At the moment and to my knowl- edge, local gaps have not yet been discovered in subatomic physics or in astrophysics. And in his theory of the relativity of time, Einstein tacitly accepts this postulate of time without gaps in local chains, but his theory also constructs special chains without gaps between spatially separable localities. Here, we are definitely not concerned with the reversibility of time which was partially examined above in light of recent discoveries in subatomic physics, for reversibility would not abolish time. Let us examine the notion of separability, of discontinuity in space. Our immediate consciousness (a mental category?) allows us to imagine sepa- rated entities, which in turn necessitate contiguity. A void is a unity in this sense, contrarily to time, in which our inherited or acquired mental notions bar us from conceiving the absence of time, its abolition, as an entity shar- ing time, the primordial flux. Flux either is, or is not. We exist, thus it is. For the moment, one cannot conceive the halting of time. All this is not a paraphrase of Descartes or better yet, of Parmenides: it is a presently impassable frontier. (Thus, in paraphrasing Parmenides for once, passable: "T yap av(r voELv raTLv rE KaL ef L .) To get back to space, the void can be imagined as a dwindling of the entity (phenomenon) down to an infinitesimal tenuousness, having no density whatsoever. On the other hand, to travel from one entity to another is a result of scale. If a person who voyaged were small, the person would not encompass the totality of entities, the universe, at once. But if this person's scale were colossal, then yes. The universe would offer itself in one stroke, with hardly a scan, as when one examines the sun from afar. 88</page><page sequence="6">Concerning Time The entities would appear, as in a snapshot, reunited in a dense network of nontemporal contiguities, uninterrupted, extending through the entire universe. I said, in a snapshot. That is to say that in the snapshot, the spa- tial relations of the entities, the forms that their contiguities assume, the structures, are essentially outside time (hors-temps). The flux of time does not intervene in any way. That is exactly what happens with the traces that the phenomenal entities have left in our memory. Their geographical map is outside time. Music participates both in space outside time and in the temporal flux. Thus, the scales of pitch; the scales of the church modes; the morphologies of higher levels; structures, fugal architectures, mathematical formulae engendering sounds or pieces of music, these are outside time, whether on paper or in our memory. The necessity to cling against the current of the river of time is so strong that certain aspects of time are even hauled out of it, such as the durations which become commutable. One could say that every temporal schema, preconceived or postconceived, is a representation outside time of the temporal flux in which the phenomena, the entities, are inscribed. Due to the principle of anteriority the flux of time is locally equipped with a structure of total order in a mathematical sense. That is to say that its image in our brain, an image constituted by the chain of successive events, can be placed in a one-to-one correspondence with the integers and even, with the aid of a useful generalization, with real numbers (rational and irra- tional). Thus, it can be counted. This is what the sciences in general do, and music as well, by using its own clock, the metronome. By virtue of this same structure of total order, time can be placed in one-to-one corres- pondence with the points of a line. It can thus be drawn. This is done in the sciences, but also in music. One can now design tem- poral architectures-rhythms-in a modern sense. Here is a tentative axiomatization of the temporal structures placed outside of time: 1. We perceive separable events. 2. Thanks to separability, these events can be assimilated to points of refer- ence in the flux of time, points which are instantaneously hauled up outside of time because of their trace in our memory. 3. The comparison of the points of reference allows us to assign to them dis- tances, intervals, durations. A distance, translated spatially, can be con- sidered as the displacement, the step, the jump from one point to another, a nontemporal jump, a spatial distance. 4. It is possible to repeat, to link together these steps in a chain. 89</page><page sequence="7">Perspectives of New Music 5. There are two possible orientations in iteration, one by an accumulation of steps, the other by a deaccumulation. From here, we can construct an object which can be represented by points on a line, evenly spaced and symbolized by the numeral 1 with index zero: lo = [..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... ]. This is the regular rhythm, corres- ponding to the whole numbers. As the size of the step is not defined in the preceding propositions (recalling Bertrand Russell's observation concerning Peano's axiomatic of natural numbers), we can affix to the preceding object the following objects which I call "sieves," by using solely proposition 4: 20 = ...,-4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6,... or 21 = [...,-3, -1, 1, 3, 5,... or 30 = ...,-3, 0, 3, 6, 9,... or 31 = ...,-5, -2, 1, 4, 7,... ] or 32 = ...,-4, -1, 2, 5, 8,... etc.... From these objects and their modular nature, and with the help of these three logical operations: U union, disjunction ex. 20U21 = i1 n intersection, conjunction ex. 20n21 = 0 - complementarity, negation ex. 20 = 21 we can construct logical functions L-that is to say, very complex rhythmic architectures which can even go as far as a random-like distribution of points on a line-if the period is sufficiently long. The play between com- plexity and simplicity is, on a higher level, another way of defining the ref- erential points, which certainly plays a fundamental role in esthetics, for this play is juxtaposed with the pair release/tension. Example of a logical function L: L = (MknNinpl) u(Nrnn... nT)u ... The upper-case letters designate moduli and the subscripts designate shifts in relation to a zero point of reference. Up to this point, we have examined time perceived by means of our fac- ulties of attention and conscious thought-time on the level of forms and structures of an order ranging from tens of minutes to approximately a twenty-fifth of a second. A stroke of the bow is a referential event that can define durations of a fraction of a second. Now, there are some subliminal events found on several even lower levels. Such an example is that of the temporal segmentation produced by a very choppy amplitude envelope on 90</page><page sequence="8">Concerning Time the sound of an unvarying sinusoidal wave form. If the duration of the note is long (about one minute), we perceive the rhythms of the beats as pleas- ant, moving vibratos. If the duration is relatively short (three seconds), the ear and the brain integrate it as a timbre. That is to say that the result of subliminal, unconscious counting is different in nature and is recognized as timbre. Let us take a brief moment to consider the mechanism of the internal ear coupled with the brain which recognizes the wave form-that is to say, the timbre-and the frequency of a sound. On the one hand, it seems that the points of deformation of the basilar membrane play a fundamental role in the recognition; but, on the other hand, a sort of temporal Morse code of the electrical discharges of neurons is taken statistically into account for the detection of tone. A remarkably complex subliminal counting of time is taking place. But knowledge of acoustics in this domain is still very limited. On this subliminal level, here is another disconcerting phenomenon. It is the result of a new theory on the synthesis of computer sounds which cir- cumvents the harmonic synthesis of Fourier, practiced everywhere today, a theory which I introduced now more than ten years ago.2 It is a question of beginning with any form whatsoever of elementary wave, and with each repetition, of having it undergo weak deformations according to certain densities of probabilities (Gauss, Cauchy, logistic, ... ) appropriately chosen and implemented in the form of an abstract black box. The result of these deformations is perceptible on all levels, microstructure (= timbre), ministructure (= note), mesostructure (= polyrhythm, melodic scales of intensities), macrostructure (= global evolution on the order of some tens of minutes). If the rate of sampling had been 1,000,000 samples per second instead of approximately 40,000 (commercial standard), one would have had an effect of sounding fractals, with a sonorous effect which is impossible to predict. We see to what extent music is everywhere steeped in time: (a) time in the form of impalpable flux or (b) time in its frozen form, outside time, made possible by memory. Time is the blackboard on which are inscribed phenomena and their relations outside the time of the universe where we live. Relations imply architectural structures; rules. And, can one imagine a rule without repetition? Certainly not. Besides, a single event in an absolute eternity of time and space would make no sense. And yet, each event, like each individual on earth, is unique. But this uniqueness is the equivalent of death which lies in wait at every step, at every moment. Now, the repeti- tion of an event, its reproduction as faithfully as possible, corresponds to this struggle against disappearance, against nothingness. As if the entire universe fought desperately to hang on to existence, to being, by its own tireless renewal at every instant, at every death. Union of Parmenides and 91</page><page sequence="9">Perspectives of New Music of Heraclitus. Living species are an example of this struggle of life or death, in an inert Universe launched by the Big Bang (is it really inert, that is, without any changes in its laws?). This same principle of dialectical combat is present everywhere, verifiable everywhere. Change-for there is no rest- the couple death and birth lead the Universe, by duplication, the copy more or less conforming. The "more or less" makes the difference between a pendular, cyclic Universe, strictly determined, and a nondetermined Uni- verse, absolutely unpredictable. Unpredictability in thought obviously has no limits. On a first approach it would correspond to birth from noth- ingness, but also to disappearance, death into nothingness. At the moment, the Universe seems to be midway between these two chasms, something which could have been the subject of another study. This study would deal with the profound necessity for musical composi- tion to be perpetually original-philosophically, technically, aesthetically. -translated by Roberta Brown NOTES 1.
