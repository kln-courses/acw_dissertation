Dennis A. Guenther The Ohio State Univ. ABSTRACT This paper presents an overview of the evolution of computer simulations in vehicle collision and occupant kinematic reconstructions. The basic principles behind these simulations, the origin of these programs and the evolution of these programs from a basic analytical mathematical model to a sophisticated computer program are discussed. In addition, a brief computer development history is discussed to demonstrate how the evolution of computer assisted vehicle accident reconstruction becomes feasible for a reconstructionist . Possi- ble future research in computer reconstruction is also discussed. INTRODUCTION A number of simulation programs for motor vehicle accident reconstruction were developed in the late 1960 's and early 1970?s. Other programs, which include the modified versions of previously developed ones, have been developed in recent years. The capabilities as well as limitations of these programs have been discussed by McHenry [66], Jones [45], Kamal [49], Warner &amp; Perl [152], Smith and Noga [139], Robbins [122], Woolley [154] and Brach [15]. Because of easy access to power- ful computer systems and the lowering of computer operation cost, more ambitious computer programs will no doubt be added to the present list. This paper traces the evolution of reconstruction computer programs for vehicle collisions and occupant or pedestrian kinematics. The computer development history and the effects of analog and digital computers on reconstruction program development are briefly discussed. This is followed by the evolution of vehicle collision reconstruction programs such as SMAC and CRASH. The discussion then proceeds to the evolution of programs for reconstruction of occupant or pedes- trian kinematics in an accident environment. These include the MVMA2D and the CALSPAN CVS computer programs, among others. Finally, possi- ble research topics in the computer reconstruction field are presented. COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT HISTORY AND ITS EFFECT ON COMPUTER ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION As with any field heavily dependent on computers, advances in accident simulation have historically followed the development of computer hardware. In order to understand fully the evolution of computer assisted motor vehicle accident recon- struction, one then needs to have a brief knowl- edge of the history of computer development. The following histories of analog and digital com- puters give an overview of analog and digital computer (116) . Analog Computers Between World War I and II, much work was done in developing the mechanical differential analyzer, a close relative of the modern analog computer. Simultaneous equation solvers and harmonic ana- lyzers of many types appeared in the 1920 's and 1930's. George H. Philbrick worked on an all-electronic analog computer in the mid-1930 f s and is credited by many to have first used feedback amplifier theory to develop the operational amplifier. Independently of and shortly after Philbrick' s first work, the Bell Telephone Laboratories developed the M9 Gum Director under the impetus of the then impending World War II. In 1947, Ragaz- zini, Randall and Russell built an all-electronic d-c analog computer. Immediately thereafter, several companies designed and developed analog computers for their own use and for sale to others. In 1948, Reeves Instru- ment Co., under a Navy contract, built the fore- runner of the first commercially available analog computer. Many companies have entered and left the analog computer field since its birth in 1948. Digital Computer History The digital computer age began when the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) 3.1264 0096-736X/88/9603-1 264$02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">started working in August 1944. The machine was based on the mechanical technology of rotating shafts, electromagnetic clutches, and counter wheels, developed over the years for punched card tabulating machinery. It was constructed by IBM, following the ideas of Howard Aiken, whose origi- nal proposals go back at least to 1937. The concept of the large-scale electronic computer is due to J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly. They were already building the ENIAC when the Harvard Mark I was commissioned. The ENIAC began to function in 1945 and was approximately 1,000 times faster than the Harvard Mark I. In 1951, the first UNIVAC was delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau. It was a fully engineered machine, with magnetic tape and other peripherals required for large-scale business operations. The development of digital computers can be conveniently categorized as successive generations as shown in Table 1 for the first, second and third generation computers. Computers introduced since 1975 will be categorized as modern com- puters. As seen from the following, all existing popular vehicle collision and occupant kinematic simula- tions programs were originally developed in the late 1960 !s and early 1970' s . This was because of the third generation digital computers developed during the time. These computers were powerful enough to handle the complex arithmetic and solve complicated equations of motion which were used in sophisticated computer simulations such as SMAC, CRASH, HSRI2D, HSRI-3D and CAL3D, and others. From an accident reconstruct ionist viewpoint, analog computers were helpful in developing the primitive computer modeling techniques which required solving several simultaneous differential equations. They were also used in obtaining and analyzing useful data from the vehicle collision tests performed in the 1950 's and I9601 s . This provided a good data base to verify more sophisti- cated collision and occupant kinematic models developed in the late I9601 s and early 1970' s . When the third generation digital computers came out in 1964, engineers and researchers in the field realized the power of the digital computer and many of them started performing complex computer simulation work on these powerful com- puters. Since the late 1960's, all major colli- sion simulation work has been conducted on digital computers. To present reconstructionists , the most important modern computer development would be in areas of minicomputers and personal computers (PC) . Minicomputers enable medium and small size firms to do reconstruction work with sophisticated programs. They also allow engineers and re- searchers in smaller firms to conduct research in computer simulation for vehicle accidents. Personal computers provide the means for a recon- structionist to use the PC versions of several 871991 available sophisticated reconstruction programs. A reconstructionist can also develop his own reconstruction program or modify existing ones on a PC. Personal computers have increased the use of computerization in accident reconstruction at a rapid rate in the last few years and have aided in spawning a wide range of personalized simulation programs . Though only computer hardware was mentioned above, computer software developments in the recent past have also played a very important part in vehicle collision simulation development. With the improved software available, engineers and re- searchers are able to develop more efficient and user friendly programs. Two important progress areas are integration and matrix inversion tech- niques, which are required in all reconstruction programs. The development of easy to learn yet powerful programming languages has shortened program development time and facilitated user oriented programming. Both have been responsible for the widespread development work and usage of computer reconstruction programs in recent years. THE EVOLUTION OF VEHICLE COLLISION RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS SMAC and CRASH are the two vehicular accident analysis programs which have proliferated more than any other similar programs. Their develop- ment spans much of the period during which acci- dent simulations have evolved. As such, study of these programs provides a good overview of the evolution of vehicle collision reconstruction programs. This section of vehicle collision reconstruction modeling is divided into four parts. The basic physical laws used in formu- lating all vehicle collision computer modeling are discussed first. This is followed by the evolu- tion of the SMAC program and the evolution of the CRASH program. Other vehicle collision programs are then presented including the modified versions of the SMAC and CRASH. Basic Physical Laws In Formulating Vehicle Colli- sion Reconstruction Programs Even though many vehicle collision computer models have been developed since the late I960' s , only a few remain in wide use. Among them, the SMAC and CRASH programs are the most widely used. The basic physical laws used in all these models, including SMAC and CRASH, are: 1. conservation of energy 2. conservation of linear momentum 3. conservation of angular momentum 4. Newton's second law of motion. In the I960' s Marguard [61, 62], Emori [26, 27] and Böhm, and Horz [12] presented their papers on mechanics of vehicle collisions. Historically, two different modeling techniques have been applied to the impact of vehicles. Both of these techniques employ the conservation of linear 3.1265</page><page sequence="3">Table 1 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER GENERATIONS Development Early First Late First Second Early Third Late Third Generation Generation Generation Generation Generation 1946-1953 1953-1959 1959-1964 1964-1969 1969-1975 COMPONENT TECHNOLOGY Vacuum tubes i 1 Transistors I I Hybrid circuits I 1 Monolithic I 1 integrated circuits Medium- and I 1 large-scale integration MAIN MEMORY TECHNOLOGY Delay lines v i Electrostatic i 1 tubes Magnetic drums i 1 Magnetic cores I 1 Large-scale t l integration MAIN MEMORY CYCLE TIME 40-40,000 I 1 10-20 I 1 2-10 I 1 0.5-2 I 1 0.020-1 I 1 PERIPHERAL STORAGE Magnetic tapes i 1 Magnetic drums i i Magnetic disks i 1 Laser and I 1 magnet ic bubbles TYPICAL EN I AC , IBM 650, Philco Burroughs IBM 370 EXAMPLES EDVAC 704, 705 2000 B5500, series, S E AC, S VAC 709 CDC 1604, CDC 6000 System 3 Harvard UNI VAC II, 3600 series, CDC Cyber Mark III, 1103A, IBM 7000, 3300 70 series IV SS80 1400 IBM 360 DEC PDP- I AS Burroughs series series 10, 11 machine 205,220 Ferranti UNIVAC Honeywell UNI VAC I, NCR 120, Atlas 1108 2000, 1103 200 series RCA 301, Honeywell 6000 Whirlwind Datamatic 501 200 UNIVAC IBM 701, 1000 Honeywell series 1110, 702 RCA Bizmac 800 RCA 9400 Many UNIVAC Spectra Burroughs magnetic III, 1107 70 B6700, drum NCR 1700 computers Century Many G.E. mlnl- 400,600 computers momentum principle. The first [61, 62] uses the impulse-momentum formulation, together with friction and restitution to completely model the impact. The second [12] combines the impulse- momentum formulation, coupled with a relationship between crush geometry and energy loss to model the impact. Both methods ultimately produce the change in vehicle velocity V and other pertinent information about a collision. The use of energy loss due to crush deformation was formulated in the late I9601 s and early 1970* s. The use of friction and restitution in formulating vehicle collision reconstruction computer programing originated with Emori's [28, 29] concept in his mathematical collision model in 1970. The Crush Energy Approach The concept of using crush as a measure of speed was developed through private sector contract research between the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Calspan Corporation and ultimately produced the first version of CRASH in the 1970 fs. This crush concept can be linked to the conservation of energy during a vehicle collision. According to the conservation of energy principle the total energy of the vehicle before the impact is equal to the summation of the vehicle energies after the impact, the work done on the vehicles in terms of deformation an3 breaking-off of elements of vehicles and the heat lost during the impact. Conservation of energy during impact can be expressed in the following equation: mlVlb ^2+m2v2b ^2-mlVla /2+m2V2a ^2+H+Edl+Ed2 (1) where m^ = mass of vehicle 1 m^ = mass of vehicle 2 v^k = velocity of vehicle 1 before impact v 2k = velocity of vehicle 2 before impact = velocity of vehicle 1 after impact = velocity of vehicle 2 after impact H = heat loss during the collision E = energy absorbed by the deformation of vehicle 1 E, = energy absorbed by the deformation of vehicle 2 The above expression uses the usual assumption that the mass of each vehicle remains in one piece after the collision. Even though there are always some small pieces or elements that separate from the main vehicle body during the impact, the constant mass concept used in equation (1) has proven to be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes and is widely used. If we further assume that the heat loss is insignificant compared to the other terms in equation (1) we obtain the following equation: mlvlb2/2-hn2v2b2/2=mlVla2/2-Hn2V2a2/2+Edl+Ed2 (2) From equation (2) one realizes that if the values of E and E^» can be estimated, the equation can be solved for two of the velocities when the other two velocities are known. Conservation of linear momentum can be used to give these two velocities and is expressed in equations (3) for the head-on vehicle collision case: mlVlb + m2V2b * mlVla + m2V2a ^ The first hint of how to estimate crush energy was provided in mechanical engineering and machine design books in the late 1800 f s and early 1900fs. In 1883 Unwin [147] stated in his book, The Ele- ments of Machine Design, that the quantity of work expended in deforming a bar is equal to the product of the deformation and the mean load producing it. Thus, if a bar is elongated or deflected A feet by a force gradually increased from nothing to P, the work done in deformation is PA/2 foot-pounds. If we have W pounds moving with velocity V, which would have a kinetic energy of WV /2g stored in the deformation of the bar, the relationship between the impulsive load and the resistance of the bar when the direction of the impulsive load coincides with the direction of deformation is: WV2/2g = PA/2 (4) V = ^PAg/W (5). 3.1266</page><page sequence="4">This is one of the first premises which would help to give the basis upon which crush can be used as a measure of speeds in vehicle collisions. Furthermore, Leutwiler [55] presented in his 1917 text, Elements of Machine Design, his test for stresses due to suddenly applied loads. For the case in which the suddenly applied force P has no velocity before striking the unstrained member; the external work done by this force is P , in which represents the total deformation of the member. The internal work expression is: Internal work « A A S/^ (6) where A = area of the member S - stress induced in the member that does not exceed the elastic limit. Equating the external work to the internal work, we obtain S « 2P/a (7). One of the first graphical presentations is shown by Dunkley [25] in his 1917 text, The Design of Machine Elements . He presents a graph, shown in Figure 2, that equates the work done by load W falling a distance X as the area of the rectangle OABC = Wx. The work absorbed by the straining of L &gt; - W ]_Ę^r Figure 1 C| ~A~~ ' / STRAIN 1 / X I/ LOAD I B W A Figure 2 871991 the bar is given by the area of the triangle 0AB=Wx/2. When the strain reaches the maximum value for a gradually applied load W, i.e. x, the suddenly applied load W has a store of kinetic energy Wx/^. By equating strain energy and work done on the deformation, Dunkley concluded that the effect of a suddenly applied load is to cause a strain and consequently a stress of double that caused by a gradually applied load of the same amount and also to set up a vertical vibration. The vibrations are, however, gradually damped until the bar is stationary with a strain x. References [10, 11, 16, 25, 55, 59, 106, 138, 147] all deal with this fundamental concept of energy equated over the deformation. In fact, by applying the first law of t hermo dynamic s and disregarding the electromagnetic effects, we have: We + Q - AT + AU (8) Where W = work performed on the system by exter- nal forces Q » heat that flows into the system AT = increase of kinetic energy Au Ä increase of internal energy. On the other hand, the law of kinetic energy is expressed by the equation: We + ' = A T (9) Where W^ = work performed by internal forces in the system and ■ increase of kinetic energy. Equations (8) and (9) yield: W± = Q - Au (10). If we ignore the quantity of Q which, is negligi- ble in vehicle collision reconstruction cases, we obtain: W± - Au (11) This says that the change in energy of the system is equal to the work performed by internal forces in the system. In a vehicle collision system, W^ can be equated to a force acting through a distance. That distance, in terms of the crashing of vehicles, is equal to the crush. The concept is then used to model the work of deformation produced during a collision. In the 1950' s and I960' s Severy and his team at UCLA performed many vehicle collision tests and obtained in-depth crush measurements. In 1968 Emori [26, 27] analyzed these data and suggested that frontal and rear automobile collision pro- cesses may be simulated by a simple model with a mass and spring representing the vehicle mass and the resisting force due to crushing of the vehicle structure respectively. He suggested, to reason- able accuracy, the deceleration force experienced 3.1267</page><page sequence="5">by an automobile in a head on collision was directly proportional to the deformation. He went on to suggest that frontal crush should be direct- ly proportional to the impact speed. In that same year Vankirk, Hirsch and Sato [149] presented the equivalent barrier impact velocity concept to provide a method to relate the severity of vehicle impact to different types of objects. They suggested that measured kinetic energy is a function of vehicle deformation volume. In 1972 Campbell [19] and Mason and Whitcomb [64] independently proposed a linear relationship between the residual crush C and frontal fixed rigid barrier (FRB) speed V of the form shown in equation (12) : V = b + b.C (12) o 1 where V = impact speed, mph C = residual crush, in b = intercept, mph b^ » slope, mph/in. One example is shown in Figure 3. Mason and Whitcomb proposed a set of coefficients, bQ and b. , to be used for determining impact speeds. These were actually the barrier equivalent speeds of accident vehicles. 60 V= 6.85 + 0.88 (CRUSH) • I Ws 4500 # X ^ 50 - X a / a E i/ / 0 40 - X UJ / ÜJ / 1 jr « 30 - ym 0 X Sí 20 - y* 1 * • IO -/ ✓ 0 I I I I I I I 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 RESIDUAL CRUSH, inches Figure 3: Residual crush vs. impact spped in full frontal barrier tests for 1 71-f72 full size GM vehicles In 1974 Campbell [20] suggested that force per unit width as a function of crush C is given by: f = W(b b.+b.2C)/gw (13) Olí o where f = force per unit width W = standard weight g = gravitational acceleration b , b. = coefficients from equation (12) C° = crush w ■ vehicle width, o The assumption made is that the linear force- deflection characteristic does not vary across the width of the vehicle. This model of equation (13) also assumes that the damage is uniform vertical- ly. Damage produced by underride or override is not covered. From equation (13) , we can obtain a general expression to compute the energy absorbed by the crush as: Crush Energy = j*Jf d C d w + WbQ2/2g (14) The last term represents some initial energy which may be absorbed with any residual crush, as implied by barrier test data presented. Substituting equation (13) for f and integrating with respect to crush C, we get: Crush energy = /•W W/gwJ ° (bQb1C+b12C2/2)dw+Wbo2/2g (15) A more familiar form of equations (13) used in formulating the CRASH program is: f = A + BC (16) 2 Where A = Wb b./ (gw vo ) o 1 vo o B = Wbļ2/(gWo). Crush energy could be obtained by a double inte- gration over crush depth and crush width as: Crush Energy = (A + BC) dC dw J w 0 (AC + BC ? (AC + BC /2 + G) dw (17) 0 2 where G = Wb /(2gw &amp; ). o &amp; o A numerical version of equation (17) which allows for 2, 4, or 6 equally spaced points on the crush profile is implemented in the CRASH 3 program [101]. Once the crush energy of the collision vehicles is obtained, equations (2) and (3) can be solved to obtain the unknown velocities if two of the four vehicle velocities are known. The equivalent barrier speed (EBS) can also be calculated as shown in equation (18) and may be used as a measure of collision severity: W(ESB)^/(2g) = Crush Energy EBS = y 2g (Crush Energy) /W (18). It should be noted that the formulation of crush energy, as shown in equations (15) or (17), was a 3.1268</page><page sequence="6">major step in vehicle collision reconstruction modeling. The estimation of crush energy measure- ment of the crush profile and the values of A, B and G turns out to be the only feasible way to practically measure the loss of kinetic energy during a vehicle collision. Values of A, B and G were obtained from data analysis of measurements made in staged crash tests that were funded by NHTSA and/or contractors from the private sector. In the 1970 's many finite element methods (FEM) and structured analysis models were developed. Some of these programs are KRASH, MARC, ANSYS, NONSAP, DYCAST, ACTION, WHAM II, UMCVS and NASTRAN. Engineers in the automobile industries have been able to use these programs to predict the crash response of the vehicle structures. However, many material property parameters are needed to run these programs and it is very unusual for a reconstructionist to have all the necessary parameters available. As a result, these programs have been used mostly by automobile design engineers who can select or easily obtain the required parameters. The Friction and Restitution Approach As mentioned before, another vehicle collision modeling technique employs the impulse momentum formulation of Newton's Second Law coupled with friction and restitution. In this case the impulse-momentum formulation is used exclusively; no energy equation is used. A classical formula- tion is presented by Brach &amp; Brach [15]. In their formulation for the two particles shown in Figure 4, he obtained the final equations in matrix form as shown below: .t' Figure 4: Free Body Diagram of Two Particles -i"l 0 mi 0 /Vin' ml 0 m2 0 /Vin' 0 "l 0 »2 Pit . 0 -1 0 »2 fit -1 0 il oj L . e 0 -e 0 fit v2n ym1 -n^ -Um2 m2 V¿f -n^ -Um2 m¡2 'v2ļ. 871991 Where m^ = mass of particle 1 = mass of particle 2 y = coefficient of friction e = coefficient of restitution V = final velocity v = initial velocity. Where velocity symbols are double subscripted, the first subscript refers to the particle and the second subscript refers to the coordinate direc- tion. From equation (19) one can solve four unknown velocities if four other velocities, y and e, are known. One problem with this approach is with the estimations of y and e. In a usual reconstruction case, the final velocities can be calculated if enough post-impact data is obtained from the accident. The initial velocities can then be calculated from equation (19). Another problem with this technique is that the tangential and normal components of the velocities are used in equation (19) and that makes its solution much more sensitive to the angle of velocity. This angle is usually estimated. Further research is needed in estimating the values of e and to make this technique more acceptable. The Evolution of SMAC In the 1950* s and I960' s Severy, Brink and other UCLA researchers performed many vehicle collision tests which provided a large body of vehicle and occupant response data in an impact environment. Concurrently, other researchers were formulating collision mechanics theories and mathematical models to predict occupant and vehicle responses in a vehicle collision. They usually validated their models with the measured data from UCLA vehicle tests. In addition, automotive safety engineers were interested in automobile safety design. They formulated their own computer models to investigate occupant kinematics and vehicle dynamics during an impact environment. There were four major groups in the United States doing research during this period in vehicle safety standards, vehicle safety design, crash testing, vehicle dynamic and occupant kinematic modeling: automobile researchers working in the automobile industry, those at the UCLA, those at the HSRI of the University of Michigan and those at the Cornell Aeronautical Lab (later changed to Calspan Corp.). These researchers realized the limitation of human tolerance information that could be obtained through experiments with volunteers, cadavers, animals and anthropomorphic dummies. They had to maximize the use of information from the extensive data generated by actual accidents in development of systems, devices and structural standards for improved occupant protection in automobile collisions. Recognizing the needs of automobile safety re- searchers, in the early 1970 1 s the NHTSA supported the research in application of computer simulation techniques to the interpretation of physical evidence in highway accidents. The objective was 3.1269</page><page sequence="7">to develop an investigative aid that would serve to achieve uniformity as well as significant improvements in accuracy and detail in the inter- pretation of evidence in terms of occupant expo- sures. The result was the presentation of the Simulation Model of Automobile Collisions (SMAC) computer program by McHenry [69] in 1973. The SMAC program application procedure can be divided into three phases. As a reconstructionist might expect, phase 1 is for post-collision trajectories, phase 2 is for collision contact and phase 3 is for pre-collision trajectories. It was planned, eventually, to automate the iterative aspects of the SMAC program so that the user would input only the measured evidence and the program either would converge on a definition of the overall event that achieved an acceptable fit to the evidence or would indicate a need for checking or supplementing the measured scene data. In the original SMAC program, the assumptions made in calculating the collision force are: 1. The vehicles are treated as rigid bodies, each surrounded by a layer of isotropic, homogeneous material that exhibits elastic- plastic behavior. 2. The dynamic pressure in the peripheral layer increases linearly with the depth of penetra- tion relative to the initial boundary of the deflected surface. 3. The adjustable, non-linear coefficient of restitution varies as a function of maximum deflection. 4. The vehicle motions are limited to a horizon- tal plane in which the effects of pitch and roll can be neglected. The assumptions made in calculating tire force are: 1. The vehicle motions are limited to a horizon- tal plane in which the effects of pitch and roll can be neglected. 2. The terrain surface is flat and horizontal. 3. Effects of camber and of roll-steer of the wheels are neglected. 4. The "friction circle" concept approximates interactions between circumferential and side forces of the tires. 5. A step change in the tire ground friction coefficient occur at a linear boundary between two terrain zones. 6. The tire-ground friction coefficient de- creases linearly with the resultant speeds of the individual wheel centers (option) • The SMAC program can be operated in either two- vehicle or s ingle -vehicle modes. It was the most sophisticated reconstruction program at the time when it was first introduced. In 1974 Jones [46] developed a START program which automatically generates the input required for the SMAC program from a minimum amount of data avail- able at the accident scene. In effect, he made the SMAC program "user friendly" and more effi- cient. Since the introduction of the SMAC program in 1973, NHTSA and private sector contracts were employed through the late 1970 1 s to upgrade it. James, et. al. [43] introduced modifications to improve narrow-object crash simulations, to model a sloping terrain and to include the hard spots in the vehicle crush layer. Chi, et. al. [21] revised the numerical integration scheme. Moffatt [98] introduced optimization logic to semi- automate the process of matching input conditions and rest positions. Warner and Perl [152] cor- rected some coding errors and made modifications to correct the inherent problems of overrestitu- tion and unwarranted oversimplification of tire force calculations. In 1983 Perl et. al. [113] proposed improvements in crush layer fidelity which would broaden the utility of the program. They proposed to use their SMACED program to assume the burden of formatting and qualifying input data information for processing by SMAC routine leaving the user free to concentrate on the physical meaning of the program input and outputs. With the improvements mentioned above, modified SMAC has become a much more powerful, efficient and user friendly program than its original version in 1973. It has been one of the most widely used reconstruction programs in the world since its original version came out. The Evolution of CRASH Based on research performed under private sector contracts with NHTSA, McHenry [71] presented the original version of CRASH in 1975. This develop- ment, the Calspan Reconstruction of Accident jSpeeds on the Highway (CRASH) computer program, includes significant improvements in the accuracy of the START approximations. This program uses the crush energy technique as shown in equation (17) to model the impact. It makes use of the Vehicle Damage Index (VDI) as defined in [123] and it includes provisions for use of supplementary damage details when they are available. The CRASH program is designed to achieve uniformity in the interpretation of physical evidence from automobile accidents. In particular, the speed-change, AV, and its direc- tion are believed to be the best indicators of exposure severity for the vehicle occupants. In most collision reconstruction CRASH runs the material properties of the vehicles; the A, B and G values, the crush profiles of the collision vehicles; the principal direction of force (PDOF) and the post-impact velocities will be the input of the program. The V's and pre-impact speeds of the vehicles will be the program out put. Values for A, B and G correspond to the energy absorbed in barrier crashes with standard test weights and are stored in a table that is catego- rized for four vehicle sizes and for the front, 3.1270</page><page sequence="8">side and rear of each vehicle size (Table 2). The calculation procedure for calculated crush energy permits a four-point definition of the damage (crush) profile. Table 2 DAMAGE DATA Coeff.

In preliminary applications to evidence generated by staged collisions, a range of + 12% accuracy of reconstructed speeds and speed changes was indicated. In 1976 McHenry and Lynch [83] modified the CRASH program to incorporate an optional trajectory simulation routine based on the corresponding portion of the SMAC program to permit automatic testing and refinement of the CRASH estimates of separation velocities. CRASH was also modified to provide an optional abbreviated format for its time-sharing version and to provide an optional batch mode of operation. In addition, it was modified to revise and extend the output format. Calculations were incorporated to shift the user-centered midpoint dimension of the damage, D, to the centroid of the damage area prior to the calculation of effective masses in the damage routine. The modified version of CRASH is called CRASH 2. With the trajectory-testing option and other refinements made, the potential accuracy of CRASH 2 would be expected to approach the range of + 15%. The CRASH 2 program became more efficient, powerful and user friendly than the original CRASH. In 1981 Jones and Jennings developed and evaluated the CRASH 2 program for use under European Condi- tion [48]. They found that the accident environ- ment in Europe was sufficiently different from that in the United States and, if CRASH 2 was not modified, it would have very limited use in European accident reconstruction. To improve the reconstruction accuracy of CRASH 2 for European size vehicles, the stiffness coefficients used in the damage analysis routine were reassessed for the minicar, subcompact and compact car catego- ries. The new coefficients showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of individual cases. 871991 Provisions for vehicle yaw at impact were also added to the program. During the late 1970 f s and early 1980's, con- tinuing contract work with NHTSA was performed to upgrade the CRASH 2 program. McHenry &amp; Lynch [63] were working on revision of the CRASH 2 program while Monk and Guenther [99] were doing work in the update of CRASH 2 Computer Model Damage Tables. As mentioned above, Jones &amp; Jennings [48] were doing modifications for European accident reconstruction. Beginning in 1981, NHTSA began using and distributing CRASH 3 and, since then, it has been the most widely used reconstruction program in the United States. Shortly after CRASH 3 was developed, Smith &amp; Noga [139] examined its accuracy and sensitivity in computing velocity change, AV. Accuracy was related to how well it performed in comparison with results from 53 independent staged colli- sions. Sensitivity was related to estimated field errors or imprecision of the A V computation. The sensitivity to error in coefficients of the force-deflection relationship was also examined. They concluded that in general CRASH 3 tends to underestimate A V at low values of A V and tends to be accurate at high AV. With regard to sensitivity, they found that for selected impact types a 10% error in the coefficient of this assumed force-deflection relationship resulted in errors of approximately 2-6% in AV. Since 1981 modifications to CRASH 3 have been suggested to make it more accurate, efficient and user-friendly. In 1986 McHenry &amp; McHenry [85] suggested a revised damage analysis procedure for CRASH 3 to include restitution effects. Recently, Struble [143] has recommended several enhancements to CRASH 3. There is no doubt that others will come up with more suggestions to upgrade CRASH 3. However, the authors think that an update of the CRASH 3 damage tables is the most urgently needed. This is due to the continued downsizing of vehi- cles, development of new models, and a desire to expand the utility of the program to a wider range of accidents. Government support is needed to perform staged collision tests for this need. Development of Other Collision Reconstruction Computer Programs Before SMAC and CRASH were available, many automo- bile safety researchers and reconstructionists developed their own computer programs to simulate vehicle collisions. These programs were basically simple computer coding of mathematical models. They were designed for engineers and researchers and were not user friendly. Numerical results were usually the only output. Since the early 1970's, plotters and graphic terminals have been more widely available to engineers and research- ers. As a result, more programs that can produce graphic solutions are available. In 1970 Kamal [49] formulated a computer program for analysis and simulation of a vehicle to 3.1271</page><page sequence="9">barrier impact. The output of this program includes vehicle motion, deformation, and the dynamic forces transmitted to the passenger compartment. At about the same time when SMAC was presented by McHenry, Lin [57] presented his 5 degree of freedom model to predict the dynamic responses of unibody passenger car during a rear-end barrier impact. In the year CRASH came out, Lin, et. al. [57] presented their computer model to investigate the two-car head-on impact and Bhushan [9] developed a set of equations of motion to analyze automobile collisions. In 1976 Segal [129] presented the Highway-Vehicle Object Simulation Model (HVOSM) . In 1977 Greene [35] proposed his computer simulations for front-to- front and front-to-side vehicle collisions. In 1981 Hagiwara, et. al. [36] presented their hybrid program, called FEMASS, which is a combination of the lumped-mass method and the finite element method programs. They reported that the simula- tion results agreed quite well with test results. In 1983 Brach [14] used the method of least squares to formulate his two-vehicle collision model, which computes coefficients of restitution and friction and velocity components. In 1984 equations of motion and analysis of longitudinal motion of the rider/motorcycle system were presented by Kondo, Tomita &amp; Sugita [50]. Even though no motorcycle accident reconstruction program is available, their work has built the foundation of a possible motorcycle accident reconstruction program in the future. In that same year, Woolley [154] came up with another 2-D collision model called "IMPAC". It was formulated by using the coefficient of restitution and friction techniques for collision and the impulse- momentum principle. IMPAC can be used for stan- dard reconstruction calculations, to refine and check reconstruction calculations using the damage option of CRASH 3, or as a predictor for the SMAC program to reduce the number of runs required to obtain a reconstruction. In 1985 many reconstruction papers were presented. Ishikawa [42] developed a program called "JARI 2 Dimensional Automobile Collision Simulator" (J2DACS), in which vehicle and occupant models are combined. The J 2D ACS is capable of reproducing the tire yaw marks vital to the accident analysis; as well as accident avoidance maneuvers, vehicle behavior after impact, movement of occupant, vehicle deformation, etc. Niederer et. al. [105] investigated computer assisted single-view photo- gr ararne try for accident scene documentation. Martinez [63] presented his modular mini-computer operational mathematical model for automobile accident reconstruction and its verification. Computer graphic output is possible with this program. At the same time, Schaper &amp; Grandel [125] examined motorcycle collisions with pas- senger cars; providing more information for possible future reconstruction models. Anderson &amp; Warner [1] developed a vehicle trajectory simula- tion called VT for the use of automobile accident reconstruction. When used individually or in conjunction with other computer modules, it provides a convenient and accurate modular tool for trajectory simulation. In 1985 came the development of an IBM PC version of CRASH 3 called the EDCRASH by Day &amp; Hargens [23]. This program performs the same function as CRASH 3 but was designed as a screen-oriented program utilizing the environment of the personal computer. This program made reconstruction work easier because of its lower operation cost and its user-friendly programming. Meanwhile, in Europe, Zeildler et. al. [157] developed the EES-ARM program for accident analysis. It uses all three theorems of conservation - momentum, energy and angular momentum. This program is applicable for all types of accidents, including glance-off cases. Recently Fonda [32] has developed a handheld computer version of CRASH 3 called CRASHEX. It was written in BASIC and can be modified by any user. The result is that every user of CRASHEX becomes his own programmer. In Europe Schreier &amp; Nelson [126] developed MacCAR and PC-CAR. They are the Macintosh and IBM-PC versions of the EES-ARM program. With more IBM-PC and Macintosh versions of the major reconstruction programs now available, a reconstructionist has several choices in the area of computor-assisted accident recon- struction. THE EVOLUTION OF OCCUPANT/PEDESTRIAN KINEMATICS PROGRAM In the 1950 's and I9601 s automobile companies and government agencies were concerned with occupant safety in automobile accidents. During this time, Severy et. al. at UCLA performed many vehicle-to- vehicle collision tests and obtained much useful vehicle and occupant response measurement data which provide a helpful data base for future automobile safety research. Meanwhile, other engineers and researchers were developing analysis computer programs to establish safer vehicle interior designs and to model vehicle and occupant kinematics in a vehicle collision. In 1963, funded by government agencies and the Automobile Manufacturer's Association, Inc., McHenry developed a 7 degrees of freedom nonlinear mathematical model of a restrained and articulated body on a test cart to simulate frontal collision. It was formulated and programmed for an IBM 704 computer. A lack of detailed parameter and test data prevented complete validation of the model, although the comparisons between calculated and experimental responses indicated a good agreement. The results of this simulation were sufficiently, encouraging to warrant an extension of the mathe- matical model with additions aimed at the simula- tion of body responses in a confined compartment where injury-producing contact forces would occur. The revised simulation is shown in Figure 5 and was presented and validated by McHenry [65] in 1966. This model was later called the CAL 2-D model. 3.1272</page><page sequence="10">In 1968 Thompson [144] at Chrysler presented two mathematical models; an 8 degrees of freedom, 3-dimensional occupant and a 1500 degrees of freedom vehicle structure to allow a detailed study of all elements of the vehicle - occupant system plus initial validation efforts. The models were programmed for an IBM 360/50. In 1969 Roberts &amp; Robbins [122] at HSRI presented their 8-mass, 2-dimensional model programmed for an IBM 7090 or IBM 360/67 and two simple models for analog computer simulation. In addition, they presented a 3-mass, 3-dimensional model and showed that it would be a logical extension of simulation efferts at the time. Robbins et. al. [121] called these models the HSRI 2-D and HSRI 3-D models and compared predictions of these models with sled test results in the following two years. In 1971 Segal [128] at CAL finished his work in improvements of the original CAL 2-D model and the resulting model was called the ROS (Revised Occupant Simulator) model. Danforth &amp; Randall [22] at General Motors then took over the work of improving the model and released their version under the name of MODROS (Modified Revised Occu- pant Simulator) . In 1972 two major 3-dimensional models were presented. At CAL, Bartz [5] developed a computer simulation which includes a body dynamics model of 40 degrees of freedom and a contact model that generates forces from contact with vehicle sur- faces, between body segments of the crash victim and restraint forces from belts and inflatable restraints. The validity of this computer simula- tion was determined from comparisons of predicted responses with those measured in various experi- ments. The general good agreement between the simulation and experimental results, plus the relatively low cost of running the model program, demonstrated that it would be a useful engineering tool. This model was later called the CAL 3-D model. Meanwhile at HSRI, Robbins et. al. [118] developed the modified HSRI 3-D model; a 6-mass, 3-dimensional crash victim simulator. They compared predictions from this model with experi- mental data but the model was not fully validated. In 1974 Huston et. al. [40] at University of Cincinnati developed a 3-dimensional vehicle-man model which includes a body model of 31 degrees of freedom. No validation of the model was provided. Meanwhile, Robbins et. al. finished their modifi- cation on MODROS, a revised version of CAL 2-D. They called this revised 2-dimensional model the MVMA 2-D model. It has an 8-mass representation of the human body where contact between the crash victim and the vehicle is represented in terms of independent force deformation properties of the victim and the vehicle, and includes an extensible multi-joint neck and a realistically flexible shoulder joint. A real-line representation of the vehicle interior or exterior shape is given as a network of points. In that year, Backaitis [3] at NHTSA examined sensitivity of response of crash victim simulations by using this model. He 871991 compared simulation predictions with actual test results and found that MVMA 2-D provided fairly good results. In 1979, Padgaenkar &amp; Prasad [111] at Ford used the CAL 3-D model to simulate side impact and concluded that its results showed qualitative agreement with published experimental results. In 1980 Maltha &amp; Wismans [60] from the Nether land presented a compact general purpose computer program package for 2- or 3- dimensional crash victim simulation. This program was named MADYMO. This program predicts the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the victim during the crash based on data of the victim, environment, safety devices and crash conditions. MADYMO differs from most other Crash Victim Simulator (CVS) programs in its flexibility in the number of linkages and number of elements in each linkage. Great flexibility in the modeling of force interactions between ele- ments and environment is assured by the fact that user-defined submodels can readily be incorpo- rated. Examples of applications which produced encouraging results were also presented. Mean- while, Niederer [102] from Switzerland developed a 2-dimensional, 10 degrees of freedom model. However, they could not fully verify this model at the time. In France Mech ling [93] developed a 2-dimensional, 11 degrees of freedom model. He showed comparable results between its predictions and existing experimental data. In another paper Mechling et. al. [94] examined the use and limita- tion of this model and concluded that, for quali- tative analysis of results between predictions and test measurements, there is correlation. In recent years, the number of these mentioned Crash Victim Simulators (CVS) that remain to be widely used by researchers and engineers has decreased. In the United States the MVMA 2-D and the CAL 3-D models appear to have gained support while in Europe MADYMO appears to have become more popular. Since its first appearance, the CAL 3-D (also called the CALSPAN CVS) model has been modified by many different people. The most updated version is called the Articulated Total Body (ATB) model [52]. The MVMA 2-D model has also been modified several times, while its name has remained the same. The authors have mentioned the development of these CVS programs because, increasingly, recon- structionists are being asked to render opinions on what happens to the occupant inside a vehicle during an automobile accident or what happens to a pedestrian struck by a vehicle. All of these CVS programs are available for possible occupant/pede- strian kinematic reconstruction work. DISCUSSIONS AND SUMMARY As may be observed by the reader, computer graph- ics and animation in the reconstruction field have not been discussed. Even though this topic was discussed and examined in papers by Berton &amp; Connolly [8], Pereira and Guenther [112], Niederer et. al. [105], and Martinez [63] the authors 3.1273</page><page sequence="11">judged this area to be too diversified to be included in this paper. In addition, all major available reconstruction and CVS programs provide numerical and graphic outputs which are quite satisfactory to most reconstructionists. However, a user friendly engineering graphic program with application for the reconstruction field would be very helpful in a presentation of the reconstruc- tion work product to lay people. Another problem encountered by reconstructionists is the vehicle to bicycle or motorcycle accident. It would be extremely helpful to have a simulation program to concentrate on this type of accident reconstruction. Finally, it would be very helpful to have a simulation which is not as complicated as the MVMA 2-D or the ATB model but sophisticated enough to estimate a range of impacting speeds of the vehicles in vehicle to pedestrian accidents. This overview paper attempts to provide the researcher and reconstructionist an insight into the whys, hows and whens of computorized accident reconstruction development. Further research may be indicated at various points which have not been fully investigated at this time. The bibliography at the end of this paper will assist future researchers and reconstructionists in their attempts to develop and refine accident recon- struction programs to meet future simulation demands .
