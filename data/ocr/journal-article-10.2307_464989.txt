<plain_text><page sequence="1">28 Michel Foucault. The Archeology of Knowledge and The Discourse on Lan- guage. New York: Pantheon Books, 1972. Since the publication of Les Mots et les choses (the title of its 1971 English translation is The Or- der of Things) in 1966, Foucault's work has been revisionist in character and concern. For not only have his three essays on Nietzsche and Deleuze, his two later books L'Archdologie du savoir, and L'Ordre du discours,' all been about thinkers and thought, revising, reordering, reinterpreting what had been written, ordered and interpreted differently from them; but also Foucault now turned his thought back towards his own previous work. Thus it appeared in 1969 that The Order of Things and Madness and Civilization had tried "to measure the mutations that operate in general in the field of his- tory; an enterprise in which the methods, limits, and themes proper to the history of ideas are questioned; an enterprise by which one tries to throw off the last anthropological constraints [. . .]. These tasks were outlined [in those two earlier books] in a rather dis- ordered way, and their general articulation was never clearly defined" (p. 15). Also part of this revisionist phase has been Foucault's disenchantment with the idea of an author, a concept he has found grossly incapable of dealing with the trans-personal authority of texts and documents. To revise has not meant to change opinions about which authors are more sig- nificant than others, although one can assume that that too has happened to Foucault. To revise for him has meant primarily to understand more closely the pro- cess of knowledge, its formation, dispersion, trans- mission and permanence, in terms of "anonymous rules" that are extremely precise and specialized. Moreover he has been at pains to show that during the course of this understanding he has been released not only from obligations to the history of ideas, but also from the conventional biography of great men and the narration of important events. All told then a good deal of Foucault's revision has been negative, and his description of those anonymous rules is fre- quently an itemized list of what they are not. Usu- ally, however, the negatives are pronounced against what he refers to as anthropology, which is the very thing that Nietzsche had called anthropomorphism: the habit of making all knowledge in the image of man or, worse, making every item of knowledge re- ducible to an original human act without which the item would otherwise have no cognitive status. Foucault's self-revision is theoretically consis- tent with one of the principal themes of his histor- ical research, the disappearance in contemporary knowledge of man's role as central subject, author and actor. But why not also practically consistent? Because Foucault is, as I have elsewhere said, far too clearly the unusually impressive author of his work. This is an unhesitating compliment to him as a stylist of thought, yet I intend it also as a way of Edward Said, Professor of English and Comparative Lit- erature at Columbia, is teaching at Harvard this year. Edward Said JirT( It0 OF IL'GQJ(J making very doubtful his theoretical ambition to find himself, as he would like, "on the other side of discourse." An anonymous writer he clearly is not. Nevertheless the ambition to write as if from the standpoint of anonymous rules has been worth main- taining since, according to Foucault, he now knows that discourse "is made up of a limited number of statements for which a group of conditions of exis- tence can be defined." Among these conditions an author is not necessarily one of the most important. To understand this we need only recall that Freud's account of the Unconscious and its behavior is not completely dependent for its intelligibility upon the neurotic patient. The author of neurotic thoughts does not authorize, except in a limited way, the en- tire system of coherence by which his thoughts can be understood. Similarly, Marx's description of ide- ology envisages no particular individual; as a philo- sophic idea it has a force (in Marxist discourse) that need not always be referred back to Marx's biogra- phy. "Discourses are composed of signs; but what they do is more than use these signs to designate things. It is this more that renders them irreducible to the language and to speech. It is this 'more' that we must reveal and describe" (p. 49). The questions Foucault has been asking himself therefore are as i These last two works now appear together in English as The Archeology of Knowledge &amp; The Discourse on Language. The first, whose French original appeared in 1969, is translated by M. Sheridan Smith, and the sec- ond, which originally appeared in 1971, is translated-- less carefully-by Rupert Swyer. Unless otherwise noted, page references appended parenthetically to quotations from Foucault are taken from this one volume of two translations.</page><page sequence="2">29 follows: can one describe intellectual production without stopping the description at terminals like author, Zeitgeist, period, texts, ideas or language? What gives written language a recognizable imprimt 6ver and above the signature of its author? What in short is the regularity of language in use in relation to which an author is a kind of eruptive irregularity? In raising these questions Foucault, I suspect, would prefer to be called a teacher rather than an author, because a teacher exposes knowledge directly before his students, he frees "a coherent domain of description" for and with his students. The more Foucault's work increases in volume and authority the more he has agitated to diminish the author's prerogatives, the more also he has become a teacher who stands in "the field of coordination and sub- ordination of statements in which concepts appear, and are defined, applied and transformed" (pp. 182- 83). Nowhere does Foucault himself make the ex- plicit distinction between author and teacher, but it is a very useful one nonetheless. Primarily a teacher makes explicit what an author hides inside the flow- ing lines of his language: namely that knowledge is dispersion, strategy, formation, discontinuity. More- over the teacher's place of business is the class, a site of exteriority, whereas the author's locale, a page, is far less visible as activity (which it is), and much more his private property. All this is a political motif running through Foucault's Archeology as he turns the teacher's openness upon the author's ac- cumulated reserves of power. Class struggle within knowledge pits man-the-author as historian (whose security is "the destiny of rationality and the teleo!- ogy of the sciences, the long, continuous labor of thought from period to period, the awakening and the progress of consciousness, its perpetual resump- tion of itself, the uncompleted, but uninterrupted movement of totalizations, the return to an ever- open source, and finally the historico-transcendental thematic," p. 39) against a revolutionary teacher whose vocabulary replaces history of ideas with "archeology," documents with "monuments," texts with "discourses," language with "statements" (enonces). The teacher's aim is an attempt to reveal discursive practices in their com- plexity and density; to show that to speak is to do some- thing-something other than to express what one thinks; to translate what one knows, and something other than to play with the structures of a language (langue); to show that to add a statement to a pre-existing series of statements is to perform a complicated and costly ges- ture, which involves conditions (and not only a situa- tion, a context, and motives), and rules (not the logical and linguistic rules of construction); to show that a change in the order of discourse does not presuppose 'new ideas,' a little invention and creativity, a different mentality, but transformations in a practice, perhaps also in neighboring practices, and in their common articula- tion. (p. 209) Thus the teacher deprives the sovereign subject (or cogito) "of the exclusive and instantaneous right" to change discourse. What has become more clear than ever in Foucault's revisionist assault upon scholarship is the particular will to knowledge pushing his work for- ward. On the one hand, in his most recent series of lectures at the College de France he has been study- ing the regular transformations which a "polymor- phous" appetite for knowledge can undergo; on the other hand, the trajectory of his own intellectual project has re-formed itself to accommodate certain actualities in research elucidated by his practice. I think it is imperative to understand that his vocabu- lary of working terms-monument, archeology, statement, discourse, etc.-is not a fussy way of de- claring his originality, but is rather a design to meet the actualities and the desires of will to knowledge in general, and his own search for knowledge in par- ticular. If his most recent work appears to be more explicitly political and revolutionary than the work that brought him great fame, then that is because, I think, he has only lately apprehended the latent pub- lic quality of his historical investigation in Madness and Civilization and The Order of Things. Probably the May 1968 events in Paris played a major role in bringing him out from behind his work: two espe- cially important and extended interviews, in which Foucault began to draw forth the political meaning of "archeology," date from that period. One is "R6ponse 'a une question," Esprit, No. 5 (May 1968), pp. 850-74; the other is "R6ponse au Cercle d'6pis- t6mologie," Cahiers pour l'analyse, 9 (Summer 1968), pp. 9-40. From then on, I believe that Foucault's inter- ests are dominated by a symptomatic group of pres- sures on him (one can just as well call them desires or condititons or obsessions). Taken all together these pressures have kept him responsible for the goals and the results of his research, and responsive to the encroachments on him of the academy, the community of radicals, the injustices of contempo- rary society, and his own popularity. The first of these pressures is the simplest to state and the hardest to deal with. It is the historian's need to see history as a mass of historical documents intended, necessi- tated, by certain condititons, not as chance produc- tions willed into existence by the flukes of genius or time. An intellectual rejection of the watery ra- tionale usually employed in determining the setting of a text in time and place, this pressure enables Foucault to search for rigor in explanation where none had been possible previously. Yet in order to resort neither to mechanically determinist explana- tions nor to simple causal arguments, Foucault re- draws the terrain in which, as a historian, he can function systematically. To asnwer the question why did X (not A) say Y (not B) on occasion Z (not W), X, Y, Z, A, B and W must be re-defined as belonging wholly to an historically and particularly apprehensible or- der. This order Foucault calls discourse. Hence: "The question posed by language analysis of some discursive fact or other is always: according to what rules has a particular statement been made, and con- sequently according to what rules could other sim- ilar statements be made? The description of the events of discourse poses a quite different question: how is it that one particular statement appeared rather than another?" (p. 27). Obviously statement is the key word here, and consequently, as we shall see, Foucault must make the nature of the statement coherent both from the standpoint of its retrospec- diacritics/Summer 1974</page><page sequence="3">3D tive historical analysis and of its rationally intel- ligible method of production. However the place of discourse, its setting, in which statements occur, is specified by Foucault as the archive. The retrieval of the archive from its own time and place in the past and its description is what, with only the most unavoidable geological analogy intended, he calls archeology. The next pressure has already been implied in my initial definition of discourse and archive. Par- adoxically history no longer can be conceived of as a domain which is entirely, or even mainly, temporal (if by time one means, generally, the linear succes- sion of dates and events). Foucault begins The Archeology of Knowledge with a stocktaking of the extent to which recent historical research is about "the great silent, motionless bases that traditional history has covered with a thick layer of events" (p. 3). To uncover those bases is to admit that an "epistemological mutation" has overtaken the study. of history. Its essential point is what Foucault and others have called decentering, which is fundamen- tally opposed to anthropological and humanistic at- tempts to write total history radiating out from man. For the new kind of history there is no quasi-divine archi, or telos, no Weltanschauung, no smug con- tinuity, no immobile structures necessarily to be found in it. The effects of ethnology, linguistics, psy- choanalysis, and generally of Nietzschean interpre- tation have been to dissolve the priority of these given calendars which supposedly typify time. Rather the historian must now write general history: "a total description draws all phenomena around a single centre-a principle, a meaning, a spirit, a world- view, an overall shape; a general history, on the con- trary, would deploy the space of a dispersion" (p. 10). How else is one to deal with such questions as the "apparently unmoving histories" of "sea routes [...] of corn or of gold-mining [...] of drought and of irrigation [...] crop rotation [...] of the balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance" (p. 3)? No longer is the historian simply to link events in a causal series; he must now ask about different sorts of series, new criteria of period- ization, differently articulated systems of relation between series. Dates, by which a sequential calendar miming the line of a man's life was formerly con- structed and given priority, acquire diminished and qualified significance. Recurrent distributions and architectonic unities, displacements and transforma- tions-these are the spatial indicators of historical activity today, and it is Foucault's goal to formulate a method sensitive to these indicators. But the linear image of time, based on the se- quential calendar of a man's life, is itself abetted by "two models that have for so long imposed their image: the linear model of speech (and partly at least of writing) in which all events succeed one an- other, without any effect of coincidence and super- position; and the model of the stream of conscious- ness whose presence always eludes itself in its open- ness to the future and its retention of the past" (p. 169). It is to break the hold of these models that Foucault describes discourse and archive, with their own forms of sequence and succession. Here we come to the third and the most complex pressure up- on the new method. For just as history is not tem- poral sequence, because the birth-to-death span of man's life is an adequate measure neither of large units like demographic expansion, of phenomena of rupture, discontinuity, coincidence, and complemen- tarity, so too the spatial dispersion enacted by his- tory cannot be filled with objects that are analogies (disguised or not) or direct unmediated representa- tions of human life. Textual evidence, in other words, is based on historical documents, but these documents are formed and persist monumentally, according to their own laws, and not according to a human image. A text does not simply record-is not the pure graphological consequence of-an im- mediate desire to write. Rather it distributes various textual impulses, regularly and on several axes; what gives these impulses unity is what Foucault calls a discursive formation, bound neither by an individual author, a "period," a "work," nor an idea. A text, to those who persist in making of a contingent print- ing device an ontological unit having final value, is a fundamentally inconstant epistemological judgment. The background for this more than simply relativist thought was first sketched in detail by Fou- cault in the final pages of The Order of Things. He remarked there how mimetic representation after such writers as Sade, Mallarm6 and Nietzsche could convey neither their desires nor their psychological discoveries. Concurrently the logic of syntax as well as the linear sequence of printed language in their work is assaulted (and found wanting) by a wish to express non-syntactic, non-sequential thought. To- gether with these writers, Marx, Saussure and Freud put forward systems of thought for which no image was adequate. Thus writing could not have a predic- tive form based either upon biological growth or up- on a representative governing image. Instead writing sought to constitute its own realm, inhabited entirely by words and the spaces between them. In turn the relations between this realm and empirical reality were made possible according to particular strategies and enunciative functions. What ideas one has about a text therefore change definitively as one examines a novel by Virginia Woolf, or a textbook of organic chemistry, or a political pamphlet, all dating from roughly the same period. The Archeology of Knowledge takes the pro- cess of defining the realms of language and "reality" commonly known by all three such "texts" a step closer to formalization. The vocabulary and the problematics of that kind of knowledge are articu- lated by Foucault with the principle negative aim of avoiding descriptions equivalent to, or understand- able in terms of, sense impressions. Since no image is capable of containing knowledge-formal knowl- edge cannot be immediately seen, heard, smelled, felt, or tasted-it can neither be produced nor sought after (desired) in the simple experiential terms of daily life. The will to knowledge expresses itself in what Foucault calls an element of rarity very special to it. Hence the pertinence of Foucault's choice of savoir over connaissance (English regrettably trans- lates both as knowledge) for the object of his study: the former is unthinkable without reference to condi- tions and appropriations that make it knowledge, the latter-as Foucault says in a summary of his 1970-</page><page sequence="4">31 71 course of lectures at the Collkge-is best studied as something fundamentally subjective and selfish (interessde), produced as an event of desire (produite comme evenement du vouloir), and determining truth by falsification (determinant par falsification l'eflet de vdritd). Therefore knowledge (savoir) is that of which one can speak in a discursive practice, and which is specified by that fact: the domain consti- tuted by the different objects that will or will not acquire a scientific status (the knowledge of psychiatry in the nineteenth century is not the sum of what was thought to be true, but the whole set of practices, singularities, and deviations of which one could speak in psychiatric discourse); knowledge is also the space in which the subject may take up a position and speak of the objects with which he deals in his discourse (in this sense, the knowledge of clinical medicine is the whole group of functions of observations, interrogation, decipherment, recording and decision that may be exercised by the sub- ject of medical discourse); knowledge is also the field of coordination and subordination of statements in which concepts appear, and are defined, applied and trans- formed (at this level, the knowledge of Natural History, in the eighteenth century, is not the sum of what was said, but the whole set of modes and sites in accordance with which one can integrate new statement with the already said); lastly, knowledge is defined by the possi- bilities of use and appropriation offered by discourse (thus, the knowledge of political economy, in the Clas- sical period, is not the thesis of the different theses sus- tained, but the totality of its point of articulation on other discourses or on other practices that are not dis- cursive). There are bodies of knowledge that are inde- pendent of the sciences (which are neither their histor- ical prototypes, nor their practical by-products), but there is no knowledge without a particular discursive practice; and any discursive practice may be defined by the knowledge that it forms. (pp. 182-83) Knowledge is specified by discourse, and vice versa. The tautology does not matter, if only be- cause what it thereby banished is a conception of knowledge as the free-floating, spontaneous emana- tion of genius and/or individual hard work. Fou- cault is not the first modern to attack this romantic- ally humanist vision of knowledge, although I think he does more to regularize the irregularities of knowledge, to specify knowledge that is, than most others. The importance of the attack has gone far too long unnoticed, however, especially in the United States. In the first place romantic knowledge (con- naissance), signifies property quite narrowly, the property of the big brain whose inspiration knowl- edge therefore seems. Secondly it is antidemocratic, not in any vague counter-culture sense, but rather in the sense that permits its votaries to wave the ban- ner of science and knowledge and, at the same time to conceal the privilege-but not the rigor or real science, which are absent-that entitles them to act as thought-producers. In March 1972 Foucault be- gan explicitly to speak of an interplay of desire, power and interest as being the radical intellectual target in the struggle to uncover the hidden strategies of social power (L'Arc, number 49, p. 9). The con- tinuity between such a statement and Foucault's at- tack upon anti-democratic epistemology in The Archeology is plain. Thirdly, and this realization I believe is necessitated by the first two, romantic knowledge is anti-intellectual and anti-rational. Yet nowhere does Foucault say as a result that knowl- edge (savoir) is immediately accessible to introspec- tion, to direct questioning, or even to consciousness. What he does say is that knowledge is produced, dis- seminated and reformed in ways that can be intelligi- bly specified and characterized, albeit with difficulty. In one or two places Foucault carefully distinguishes between his archeological method and Chomsky's methods (never mentioned by name) of linguistic analysis based upon the generative model. While both theories appear to have a strong libertarian thrust, archeology, by seizing, out of the mass of things said, upon the statement defined as a function of realization of the verbal performance, distinguishes itself from a search whose privileged field is linguistic competence: while such a description constitutes a generative model, in order to define the acceptability of statements, archeology tries to establish rules of formation, in order to define the con- dition of their realization. (p. 207) The opacity of this disclaimer thins out a bit if it is read with the following, earlier, passage in mind: "it is vain to seek, beyond structural, formal, or in- terpretative analyses of language, a domain that is at last freed from all positivity, in which the freedom of the subject, the labour of the human being, or the opening up of a transcendental destiny could be ful- filled" (p. 112). Positivity and specification: these make up the tough, almost material, rind of knowledge. Yet like an archive (as understood conventionally) they are not wholly corporeal either, for they inhabit a spe- cial medium of rarity. Mainly, positive and specifi- able knowledge is regular, it absorbs discontinuity and individual effort, it conceals its structure, it is eminently capable of being there, even if it is not visible, and it is repeatable. This is not as unimag- inable a constellation of features as its seems. Fou- cault has assembled together various characteriza- tions made by other writers, some of whom he names and acknowledges, others he probably did not have in mind. It is a useful exercise to describe a few of these correlative discoveries made by others. They have the virtue of placing Foucault against a rela- tively familiar background where, if my irony is not mis-interpreted, the almost oppressively novel vocab- ulary of his methodology itself seems more regular. Nevertheless one must note that Foucault's own thought about originality is highly ambivalent. I shall return to that critical problem a little later. One brings Foucault together with Thomas S. Kuhn, Georges Canguilhem and Michael Polanyi only with trepidation. Nevertheless I have ventured to do so and find the attempt instructive. All of these writers on the structure of scientific knowledge stress the regularity of that knowledge, that is, the shared paradigms discussed by Kuhn that comprise a "research consensus." This consensus enables further research, accommodates or is radically altered by anomaly, and always, according to Kuhn, performs the function of providing in ongoing time "a new and more rigid definition of the field" of scientific research. "Men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prereq- diacritics /Summer 1974</page><page sequence="5">32 uisites for normal science, i.e. for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition" (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, rev. ed. 1970; p. 11). If new problems emerge as anomalies it is because they are in disharmony with "the background provided by the paradigm" (p. 65). Within the paradigm, as Canguilhem showed in a very early study that pre- dates Kuhn's Scientific Revolutions by nineteen years, criteria are formed in medicine, for instance, that determine "the normal" and "the pathological." He concludes that "every empirical concept of illness retains a disciplined relation with an axiological con- cept of illness. Consequently it is not an objective method that characterizes a biological phenomenon as pathological. It is always the relation between ob- server and individual patient, mediated by the clinic, which justifies the label pathological" (Le Normal et le pathologique. Paris: P. U. F., rev. ed. 1962; p. 156). Canguilhem dispels the subjectivist fallacy by saying that there is such a thing as objective path- ology so long as it is understood first that that objec- tivity is absolutely tied to a specific biological history (with its own time, events, sequence, sociology, or- der) and second, that the object of objective path- ological practice "is not so much a fact as a value" (p. 157). In 1966 Canguilhem refined this view by say- ing that within a science like pathology there are norms that regulate even the concept of error. Thus "health is a genetic and enzymatic correction of an error [in the substitution of one molecular arrange- ment for another: the conceptual structure of bio- chemistry here is borrowed from information- theory]. To be sick is to have been wrong, wrong not in the sense of a counterfeit note in the sense of a false brother, but in the sense of a mistaken fold of the page, or of a wrong line of verse" (Canguil- hem, p. 208). In Personal Knowledge (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1958)-to which Kuhn re- fers-and in his Lindsay Memorial Lectures, The Study of Man (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1959), Polanyi demonstrates that what he calls tacit knowledge can be incorporated, and is indeed an important part of what passes for "objective" scien- tific research. Tacit knowledge need not be immedi- ately formulable in a set of rules; nonetheless it is consentual and works as a basis upon which scien- tific research conducts itself. The point is that even the apparently contradictory status of explicit and implicit knowledge, as well as the discontinuity be- tween them, does not inhibit the regularity of the whole body of scientific knowledge at any given time. Kuhn's brilliant analysis of the role played by textbooks in contributing to the scientific par- adigm stands in a fairly close relation to Foucault's account of discursive practice "as a body of anon- ymous, historical rules, always determined in the time and space that have defined a given period, and for a given social, economic, geographical, or lin- guistic area, the conditions of operation of the enun- ciative function" (p. 117). Foucault's archeology of knowledge scants the difference between science, social science and hu- manities. All of these divisions are subject to the laws of discursive practice, and the relations between them are equally a function of these laws. If from the "archeological" historian's viewpoint, a society can be studied as a quasi-transcendental form of dis- course (I adapt this notion from Angus Fletcher's theory of a transcendental art-form in his The Tran- scendental Masque: An Essay on Milton's "Comus." Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1972), then the intra- social exclusions and incorporations that comprise the penal system, the organization of university cur- ricula, the structure of the political bureaucracy, in- sofar as these are coherent positivities, are discursive practices, too. Thus a positvity is that acted-upon knowledge which can be rationally ascertained and articulated, no matter how implicit or hidden it may first appear to be. The more one reads in Foucault the more one notices the extent to which he is sus- picious of, and attracted to, knowledge whose prac- tice conceals the fact of its fabrication. He has this in common obviously with a number of modern thinkers, of whom Barthes the structuralist, Lukics and Adorno, the neo-Marxists, furnish the most directly relevant analogies. Barthes' anatomy of myth (in Mythologies) construes the bourgeois habit of appeals to immutable "reality" as a form of illu- sionment, by which what is present is falsely given as not-made and always-there. Lukics' definition of proletarian class-consciousness also demonstrates how the bourgeois status-quo masks a discourse or a theory that denies its own self-preserving activity. And Adorno, whose philosophical investigations of contemporary reality play an important role in Fred- eric Jameson's excellent Marxism and Form (Prince- ton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1972), equates the so- called autonomy of a work of art in class society with the class-derived concealment of work: Works of art owe their existence to the social division of labor, to the separation of mental and physical work. In such a situation, however, they appear under the guise of independent existence; for their medium is not that of pure and autonomous spirit, but rather that of a spirit which having become object now claims to have surmounted the opposition between the two. Such con- tradiction obliges the work of art to conceal the fact that it is itself a human construction. (p. 408) Jameson continues Adorno's argument as follows: "There is thus given within the very concept of work -either in the form of the division of labor in gen- eral or in the more specialized types of production characteristic of capitalism-the principle of a cen- sorship of the work process itself, of a repression of the traces of labor on the product." Yet if the work process is not to remain occult, a certain order must be assumed for it. How, if one does not wish to employ crude sensationalist meta- phors, can one depict rational work as a process hav- ing significant material consequences? How does one deal with the problem of showing discourse in its persistence to be what Foucault has called a material- istic incorporeal? Val6ry's Leonardo comes to mind here. What interests Val6ry in Leonardo is not his biography but his constructive power as a mind. Construction itself has its own logic whose basis is an "intervention in natural things." The initial step in a construction is a decision to move away from nature and into the constructive element. (There is an interesting study of Leonardo's use of sketches</page><page sequence="6">33 that develops this theme further than Valry: E. H. Gombrich's "Leonardo's Method of Working out Compositions" in his Norm and Form: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance (London: Phaidon, 1966). Thereafter Val6ry meditates upon Leonardo's architectural projections for monuments which, al- though they have no empirical equivalent, neverthe- less have a special empirical validity. Leonardo saw "the air [as being] full of infinite lines, straight and radiating, intercrossing, and interweaving without ever coinciding one with another." In this element of rarity Leonardo puts his monuments: The monument (which composes the City, which in turn is almost the whole of civilization) is such a com- plex entity that our understanding of it passes through several successive phases. First we grasp a changeable background that merges with the sky, then a rich tex- ture of motifs in height, breadth, and depth, infinitely varied by perspective, then something solid, bold, resis- tant, with certain animal characteristics-organs, mem- bers-then finally a machine having gravity for its mo- tive force, one that carries us in thought from geometry to dynamics and thence to the most tenuous speculations of molecular physics. (Valkry. Collected Works. Prince- ton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1972; vol. III, pp. 49-50) "In our time," says Foucault, "history is that which transforms documents into monuments" (p. 7). Val- 6ry's account of the constructed monument corre- sponds to Foucault's concept of the duration in his- tory of texts as monument: the historian's discipline is archeology ("the intrinsic description of the monu- ment") which also passes through several successive phases. A document's monumentality can only emerge when discourse is not elided with reality. The time of its construction, the time of monumen- tal duration, the time of its analysis: these three are correlates that tend differently to repeat each other without being copies of nature or of an ideal. Monu- mentality is the general mode of presence of dis- course, although in the special sense of the word in- tended by Foucault (like Valery before him) monu- mental presence does not exclusively mean empirical visibility. A library, for instance, is one particular mode of presence for discourse as monument: as vis- ible objects the books in the stacks are less important than the infinitely interwined lines that connect the books to each other and keep the word on the pages. Moreover in the conception of books and language as a universe that Borges has made cur- rent, each discourse becomes a sort of cross-refer- ence to every other discourse. In such a universe there is no determinable origin and no final goal, since repetition underlies cross-reference. Foucault's philosophical affinity with Gilles Deleuze derives from this interest in repetition, although recently the affinity has become political as well. Deleuze's Dif- ference et repetition (Paris: P. U. F., 1968) goes a very long way towards laying forth a philosophy of repetition with which Foucault, whose recognition that there is no Origin is pre-supposed by his interest in repetition and discourse, has publicly agreed. What makes such comparative abstractions like dif- ference and repetition clear in Deleuze's otherwise very complex argument is his way of describing those things as forms of action. "Repetition [in time] is a condition of action before it becomes a concept of reflection" (Deleuze, p. 21). Using examples from Marx, H61derlin, Vico, and Nietzsche, Deleuze con- structs before his reader the drama of repetition that is capable of producing the absolutely different. Aside from being an appealingly surprising volte-face, this argument reveals the extent to which repetition, as a device or a mode or a philosophic habit, is not the opposite of originality in the romantic sense of that word. If as a concept or a description, original- ity concealed an appeal to some extra-positive "priv- ilege" (the Muse, inspiration, a "raptus") it also contained an anxiety about the value of what one was saying. As Vico was one of the first to argue, all utterance is a form of re-inscription: hence orig- inality is a far more unstable quality. Instead, it and creativity belong inherently to what Harold Bloom calls misprision, one of whose signs is parody, the form of writing relied upon to a great extent by many of the modern masters like Eliot, Mann and Joyce. This deliberate mis-taking characterizes in- ventiveness. Far from being the -realization of an "interiority" like inspiration, discourse for Foucault is only misprision and exteriority: "it is a practical domain that is autonomous" (p. 121). Therefore, "the time of discourse is not the translation, in a visible chronology, of the obscure time of thought" (p. 121). Here we can begin to understand how repetition produces difference. Discursive language is like a repertory theatre that stages numerous spectacles. This figure connects Foucault with Kenneth Burke's dramatistic analysis of literature, although Foucault holds that discursive practice is neither benign nor necessarily artistic: effectiveness is its main criterion of success. Effec- tiveness can be judged in several ways but Foucault is right, I think, not to make effectiveness dependent upon so fickle a perception as the retrospective crit- ic's. Yet neither is effectiveness passive conformity to a sort of general will. Discursive practice is modified constantly by each statement made within it, just as in Kuhn's discussion of the research paradigm every research worker re-articulates a special aspect of the paradigm and extends and refines it further. We must still ask, however, where discursive practice actually takes place, how is its effectiveness measured or realized, and what sort of activity it is really. In answering these questions in The Archeology of Knowledge Foucault admits that what he supplies is not yet a theory but only a possibility (pp. 114-15). One ought to be willing to accept this qualification if, in exchange, the possibility provides enough of an indication that a possibility now is not just an excuse for the absence of theory. In other words, is a possi- bility described at length forceful enough to prepare the ground for a theory? I think it is, in this case. For Foucault is proposing a method for under- standing social behaviour as what it is that people must do in order to speak and write as contributors to an ongoing system of the values, discoveries, er- rors, and institutions that we call knowledge (savoir). Since knowledge is neither a mysterious jumble of ideas nor a fact of nature, and since it is not some- thing that one has but something that one does, it is best conceived of initially as occupying a group of hypothetical spaces. One of them might be where one stands in order to speak, another might be from dkccri IS/Summer 1974</page><page sequence="7">3J where he draws forth the elements he combines to make a statement, another might be where he puts his statement, and a fourth might be where his state- ment is either preserved, modified, accumulated, or passed on. Surrounding all these places is a set of general boundaries, or limits, that holds all the other spaces in. This constraint is the dpistm&amp;e, which, when it is specified as an actively populated expanse of knowledge-acts at a given moment in history, is not an open space but rather a system of distances. Thus in the eighteenth century, for example, the dis- tance between religion and psychology as discipline is closer than it is a hundred years later. The whole map of such relations is what Foucault means by dpistime. This is very different from describing a Zeitgeist, or an ideology, or a Weltanschauung. What distinguishes dpisteme from them is not that all are unconscious or communal, but that only the episteme is not an implicit belief-system sometimes projected by individuals or institutions. Rather the dpistmrne "is a constantly moving set of articulations, shifts, and coincidences that are established only to give rise to others" (p. 192). The rules collectively governing these move- ments of the dpistem'-governing their appearance as events, for the dpistime is usually described by Foucault as a set of moving constraints that estab- lish an outer limit of knowledge-make discourse possible. The historical economy of discourse is the archive: The archive is first the law of what can be said, the system that governs the appearance of statements as unique events. But the archive is also that which deter- mines that all these things said do not accumulate end- lessly in an amorphous mass, nor are they inscribed in an unbroken linearity, nor do they disappear at the mercy of chance external accidents; but they are grouped together in distinct figures, composed together in accor- dance with multiple relations, maintained or blurred in accordance with specific regularities. ... The archive is not that which, despite its immediate escape, safeguards the event of the statement, and preserves, for future memories, its status as an escape; it is that which em- bodies it, defines at the outset the system of its enunci- ability. Nor is the archive that which collects the dust of statements that have become inert once more, and which may make possible the miracle of their resurrec- tion; it is that which defines the mode of occurrence of the statement-thing; it is the system of its functioning. Far from being that which unifies everything that has been said in the great confused murmur of a discourse, far from being only that which insures that we exist in the midst of preserved discourse, it is that which differ- entiates discourses in their multiple existence and speci- fies them in their own duration. (p. 129) Discourses exist within the archive. They are special- ized modes of utterance (clinical discourse, for in- stance, or sociological discourse) that must not be confused with simple jargon. A discourse is syste- matic, and it has epistemological, social, political, economic and historical relations with other dis- courses in the archive. Most important, the discourse is not dialectical-"without flaw, without contradic- tion, without internal arbitrariness" (p. 114)-and is made up of statements, which "bear an enuncia- tive function" (p. 115). We are back to effectiveness, and it now be- comes possible to see that Foucault is most interested in defining the statement: the dpisteme', the archive, even discourse, all these are analytic instruments more or less invented by the archeologist in order to approach the statement, in order to provide a suitable terminology for apprehending the statement, which is after all the very mode and presence of effectiveness. For Foucault the statement is not a sentence necessarily, nor any unit describable by grammar or logic. Moreover since it is in and of discourse it cannot be something latent that is real- ized by discourse. The more Foucault enumerates what a statement is not, the more it is evident that a statement is difficult both to make and to describe: it is rare. The statement is not just another unity-above or be- low-sentences and propositions; it is always invested in unities of this kind, or even in sequences of signs that do not obey their laws (and which may be lists, chance series, tables); it characterizes not what is given in them, but the very fact that they are given, and the way in which they are given. It has the quasi-invisibility of the "there is," which is effaced in the very thing of which one can say: "there is this or that thing." (p. 111) Perhaps a prefiguration of what Foucault means by a statement is to be found in the smile of the Chesh- ire cat or, as he himself says in the opening pages of The Order of Things, in the list of animals given in a Chinese encyclopedia referred to in "The Analyt- ical Language of John Wilkins" by Borges. "Al- though the statement cannot be hidden it is not vis- ible either [...] it is like the over-familiar that con- stantly eludes one" (pp. 110-11). Another important aspect of the statement is that it is correlative with a lack: "There may in fact be-and always are-in the conditions of emergence of statements, exclu- sions, limits, or gaps that divide up their referential, validate only one series of modalities, enclose groups of coexistence, and prevent certain forms of use" (p. 110). Thus a statement emerging prevents an- other utterance from emerging; conversely, with re- gard to a whole series of possibilities, a statement emerges to be something else, namely, a statement, but not an idea, or a sentence, or a passing remark. At all events, one thing at least must be empha- sized here: that the analysis of discourse [and of state- ments in and by discourse] thus understood, does not re- veal the universality of a meaning, but brings to light the action of imposed rarity, with a fundamental power of affirmation. Rarity and affirmation: rarity, in the last resort of affirmation [Swyer's translation here is impos- sibly garbled: Foucault says, "the rarity of affirmation"] -certainly not any continuous out-pouring of meaning, and certainly not any monarchy of the signifier. (p. 234) The peculiar, and I think the crucial, problem of The Archeology of Knowledge is its attempt to define effectiveness without theory, that is, to regard practice not as a cause of effectiveness but as the main part of it. To affirm with force even as one ex- cludes much else-this is effectiveness. Effectiveness is also to modify other effective statements, and it is also to last, to be re-activated (as when a later age returns to Marx or to Freud), to be consciously ex- cluded (as when The Wasteland excludes Christian- ity), to be re-appropriated (as in his essay "Kafka</page><page sequence="8">35 and his Precursors" Borges gives Kafka his forgotten patrimony). Lest it be assumed that statements in discourse during a given epistime make up a unity resembling either the Great Chain of Being or a Hegelian total- ity Foucault goes out of his way to show that this is not what he has in mind. Two of his most com- plex chapters in The Archeology-"Contradictions" and "The Comparative Facts"-insist yet more strongly on the discontinuous nature of statements in the archive. To the archeologist discourse is a space of dissension. Eighteenth-century Natural His- tory, for instance, is essentially a set of "intrinsic oppositions [... . distributed over different levels of the discursive formation" (p. 154). These opposi- tions articulate divergence, incompatibility, and ex- clusion. "In the case of the systematic analysis of plants [in eighteenth-century Natural History], one applies a rigorous perceptual and linguistic code, and in accordance with a constant scale; for method- ical description [during the same period], the codes are relatively free, and the scales of mapping may oscillate" (p. 154). When; however, there are no contradictions-that is, if one wishes to show, as Foucault did in The Order of Things, that eighteenth century General Grammar and Natural History are related after all-there is "a region of interpositiv- ity," which is tangled but is also a set of fairly well- articulated correlations. Everything I have so far said of Foucault in- terprets, rather than summarizes, his archeology as simultaneously the expression of radical dissatisfac- tion and radical affirmation. Let us take dissatisfac- tion and doubt first. I think he is correct to judge Western historical understanding as being based very generally upon two forms of explanation, one ver- tical, and one horizontal. Both generally work to- gether since both mix the temporal and the spatial modes. Written historical evidence is judged to be a trace, which when it is explained vertically is con- ceived of as the exterior residual expression of an interior, or underlying, force, rationale, meaning, image, or idea. When it is explained horizontally it is conveived of as having been preceded by some- thing that gives it meaning: other events, a succes- sive line of development, an Origin. To Foucault any form of understanding that sends one away to given or assumed ontologically prior forms such as an author, a period, an idea, a source, a world-view -in short, a genealogy of order-discounts the pres- ence of the evidence, its sheer persistence as event or as evidence, in favor of deterministic hyposta- tizations. Moreover these determinisms assume a priv- ilege in the understanding without account being taken of their very circumstantial nature. When Nietzsche said that discussions of poets like Homer (about whom as authors nothing was known) were judgments made by later generations and not at all accurate descriptions of reality, he was saying some- thing that Foucault would agree with readily. To say that Shelley wrote "Adonais" is not sufficiently to describe the fact that "Adonais" was written. In or- der to do that one would have to grasp first of all why to the critic in 1973 it matters that the poem was written (and this involves an archeological de- scription of literary discourse today), then to grasp how as writing the poem was received, modified and preserved in poetico-elegiac discourse in the early nineteenth century. While one may never to able to complete such an archeological description-and Foucault is under no illusion that it is anything but interminable-its stated requirements are at least a didactic way of showing that the concept of author as origin is an unsatisfactory terminal from which to begin or conclude. So too with Weltanschauungen and similar ideas of order. Deleuze has said quite ingeniously that Fou- cault has rejected horizontal and vertical explana- tions in favor of "diagonal mobility." This is an interesting suggestion but it strikes me as too me- chanical somehow. An image I prefer is that in his almost exclusive attention to exteriority and surface while discussing statements, Foucault is like a man who runs across rooftops, never descending into the houses, never going straight, always really moving from side to side. This perhaps silly picture begins to get at the combination of realism, freedom and discipline with which he negotiates the discontinuous order of knowledge. He is interested in describing the fact that knowledge is both produced and there, in knowing, for example, what concatenation of events (not mere happenings) made it possible for Linnaeus to produce his system of classification and one, (I shall permit myself a solecism) not not to produce it, two, to produce it when he did, three, to have produced it as it was produced. This is the aspect of Foucault's work that exemplifies radical affirmation. Since all knowledge is rarity, which is the affirmation of a process of exclusion (to know B is not to know A), then knowledge ("le savoir du savoir") must also be affirmative. Foucault's lists of negatives, e.g. archeology is not history of ideas, a statement is not a sentence, discourse is not made up of ideas-all these affirm the positive exclusions that add to knowledge. The will to knowledge therefore is an effort made to exclude that which is not suit- able as knowledge. This has been one of Foucault's constant themes, and the extent to which he has shown how an affirmation exclusion means that what is excluded is systematically organized and in turn refers to what it has excluded and organized, is one of the things that distinguishes him from structuralism and its more simply appropriated linguistic models. I have said in another essay that structuralism begins with linguicity: structuralism assumes that things can be apprehended by and as signs in a language, and the pertinent task for the analyst is attention to a sys- tem of signs with perpetual, even if theoretic, pres- ence. Foucault's position is that an existing system of signs is a judgment already made that those par- ticular signs shall be. He investigates the process of signs being made. In this insistence upon a judgment made both to exclude and include, Foucault there- fore describes language ethically, in the literal sense. The source or pure origin of language is something he cannot discuss; however, for every statement in discourse he can show that there is a beginning made up of organized exclusions and inclusions, a setting amidst other permitted statements, a continuity, and ascertainable transformations. Discourse is therefore the organized social diacritics/Summer 1974</page><page sequence="9">36 ethic of language: "I am supposing that in every so- ciety the production of discourse is at once con- trolled, selected, organized and redistributed accord- ing to a certain number of procedures, whose role is to avert its powers and its dangers, to cope with chance events, to evade its ponderous, awesome materiality" (p. 216). In 1916 Walter Benjamin put a similar ethical insight into language at the centre of an essay on language in general and human lan- guage in particular. Before the Fall in Eden, Benja- min says, the only knowledge without a name was the knowledge of good and evil. All things have a name, all knowledge is nouns. The serpent tempts man with new knowledge, Good and Evil, which thereafter abandons the name. [This new knowledge] is exterior knowledge, the uncreative imitation of [God's] creative verb. The name steps away from itself in this knowledge: the Fall is the moment of birth of man's language (des menschlichen Wortes), that in which the name no longer remains intact, that which has left behind a language that names and the language-one can say-that knew its own immanent magic, all this in order for language now to make itself deliberately magical from the out- side. The word must communicate something now, out- side itself. (Das Wort soll "etwas" ausser sich selbst). This is really the original sin of the spirit of language. As it communicates outside of itself the word is some- thing of a parody, by an explicitly mediate word, of the explicitly immediate word, of God's creative word (das schaffende Gotteswort); it is the Fall of a fortunate es- sence of language (der Verfall des seligen Sprachgeistes) in Adam, who stands in the middle. There is indeed a basic sameness between the word which, according to the serpent's promise, perceives good and evil and the word which on the surface conveys information. The cogni- tion/perception of things/objects is based on the name, but perception of good and evil is, in the profound sense in which Kierkegaard conceives this word, idle talk or chatter, capable only of the purification and elevation to which the babbling man, i.e. the sinner, also had to submit, namely Judgment. (Schriften. Frankfurt: Suhr- kamp, 1955; vol. II, pp. 414-15) Discourse, says Foucault, is things that are said (les choses dites)-profoundly, chatter-whose rarity (purification and elevation) is the form of judgment (on what is being excluded and on whomever does the exclusion), exteriority, and knowledge. One reason therefore that Foucault seems to give artists, visionaries, madmen, and deviants (Hblderlin, Sade, Nietzsche, Beckett) so important a place in his historical and theoretical studies is that they, more than the average user of discourse, exaggerate and make plain in their solitude and alienation the exteriority of discursive practice by outdoing discourse. What is heroic about such men is, paradoxically, their willingness to accept the ter- rifying freedom that comes from hyper-individuality. To make "I speak" into what Foucault calls a soli- tary sovereignty is to be free of all social and psycho- logical limitations: the individual act of speech upon which all is made deliberately to depend is no longer communication of something, but the stretching- forth (dtalement) of language in its raw state, as pure, deployed exteriority. Modern literature in the main is the result of this exteriority, which is not the result of signs returning to a point of origin for val- idation, and not mimetic representation. Modern lit- erature escapes the mode of being of discourse, but one result is that the speaking subject who inaugu- rates the freedom of exteriority has, by the time of Beckett's work, become a victim of language. Molloy: "I must go on; I can't go on; I must say words as long as there are words, I must say them until they find me, until they say me-heavy burden, heavy sin; I must go on; maybe it's been done already; maybe they've already said me; maybe they've already borne me to the threshold of my story, right to the door opening onto my story; I'd be surprised if it opened" (cited by Foucault, p. 215). But the role of the modern artist, mainly in the nineteenth century, is in his quasi-madness to stimulate discourse to change. Many readers of Fou- cault have been troubled by the seeming absence in his work of any way of explaining how one epistime changes into another. I think the answer one finds is largely symbolic: it is that any alienated man or group of men, who are hidden beneath discourse as the insane are hidden in asylums, nevertheless speak from their own exteriority to society. These bursts across the fabric of discourse create rents that dis- course is forced to repair. I suspect that Foucault regards Nietzsche and Freud as the most severe and the most recent of challengers to discourse: as au- thors he says that they are founders of discourse. Their work requires so great an adjustment in modes of interpretation-together with Marx, Nietzsche and Freud make interpretation a literally unending task since they begin by saying that there is no be- ginning-that interpretation itself becomes a special discursive formation. It is within the discourse of interpretation that Foucault's archeology is to be found, although presumably it is modifying the dis- course as it takes its course. The coherence of Fou- cault's work, despite its visions and revisions, is that he has always returned to the past in order to re- lease from their silence those utterances blanketted by discourse. The Archeology of Knowledge con- structs, with a terminology that often threatens to overcome the matter with which it purports to deal, the skeleton of discourse, archive and statement, whose ethic is hidden in the exteriority of practice. Who then is Foucault? To me he typifies, in a more complex and interesting form than any con- temporary writer I know, the problem of modern beginnings, a predicament to be found lurking every- where in modern rationalism. He himself seems very aware of the difficulty of his position. His most im- portant work, his inaugural Legon at the College de France delivered on December 2, 1970 opens as follows: I would like to have slipped imperceptibly into this lec- ture, as into all the others I shall be delivering, perhaps over the years ahead. I would have preferred to be en- veloped in words, borne away beyond all possible be- ginnings. At the moment of speaking, I would like to have perceived a nameless voice, long preceding me, leaving me merely to enmesh myself in it, taking up its cadence, and to lodge myself, when no one was looking, in its interstices as if it had paused an instant, in sus- pense, to beckon to me. There would have been no be- ginnings: instead, speech would proceed from me, while I stood in its path-a slender gap-the point of its pos- sible disappearance. (p. 215)</page><page sequence="10">31 This, he says later, is an expression of anxiety, for to be an author is to take on the responsibility for what one says. But what Foucault discovers is that the order of discourse, and discourse itself, allay this fear of responsibility. By being the order of spoken things, organized, controlled, and made to function by society, discourse reduces the author's authority. His "real" beginning then is his awareness of being already inserted in the order of discourse. And yet Foucault himself in his work says, by almost any literary standard, original things. His oeuvre has a unity all its own, and indeed a beginning all its own in the perceptions he has of history and lan- guage. As author then he dramatizes a vacillation be- tween writing as discourse (the author is a function of the discourse, in this case, of interpretation) and writing against discourse. This vacillation I take to be of the greatest in- terest. For it emphasizes the extent to which writing is necessarily caught between conflicting pressures which, in a large, relatively unforced view of them, are ultimately cultural and political. Every writer, as he writes, uses other writing, draws upon his ego, addresses others and his own sense of himself. How much in his writing is originality, how much repeti- tion and re-combining of "the order of discourse," how much exploitation of the discourse, how much exploitation by the discourse, how much exploitation of whatever silent voices may be hidden and ex- cluded by discourse? Foucault has recently begun to devote himself to a study of the penal system, which is an economic, social and political organiza- tion put together, in its operative forcefulness, as a discourse. What he has already said about discourse leaves this particular undertaking prey to the doubt that his decision to study penal laws is a beginning that may, on the one hand, be a re-assertion of a discourse concerning crime in contemporary France, but may, on the other hand, begin a new system of thought about crime. Similarly, since Foucault has always explicitly addressed Western discourse, we must ask whether such an archeological project as his has not further intensified the ethnocentricity of Western discourse in its appropriation of the op- pressed races everywhere under its domination, or whether archeology can supply other cultures with the instruments with which to withstand further domination? These problems have everywhere appeared whenever a method has taken on the task of con- necting the most minute particulars of human ex- perience with the most common and universal of human concerns. Vico, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud are notable examples. As with most contemporary writ- ers Foucault is saturated with their discoveries and emboldened by their examples. Yet still more ex- plicitly than they, he acknowledges that their work places drastic limitations upon the idea of man as author of his work. So much so that discourse-the monumentality of man's organized utterance-is an order of, indeed is, repetition. To begin therefore is to repeat. If I have understood The Archeology of Knowledge correctly, however, consciousness of repetition, as a rational method of understanding, is a way of beginning to stand openly in the path of mistaken originality. When a society oppresses its citizens in the name of an original spirit of laws, or when a writer masks his opportunism behind a com- mon original "tradition," or, conversely, when rev- olution is derided as the repetition of hopeless uto- pianism, then in response one can begin again to study, act, write-again. Learning and, consequently, writing, as the author alternates between them, ex- emplify the cycle of repetition and beginning, but it is when the distance between them is not made either into a fetish or a commodity (called, with market- oriented affirmation, originality or creativity) that they lead to knowledge and freedom. Much of Foucault's latest work is a kind of formalized recapitulation of Western historical un- derstanding, done with such complex instruments of rational exposition as to give that understanding, and the accumulation of power that it represents, an al- most physical presence. For such a presence a re- course to romantic originality is no response, and neither are dropping out, the recitation of revolu- tionary-sounding slogans, or empty appeals to a long-gone past. Although they are very much his own invention, Foucault's array of "anonymous rules" binding knowledge together, along with his re- peated insistence upon their anonymity, are, I think, an invitation to the intellectual to see knowledge practically as a collective responsibility. When he says that he presents not a theory but a possibility Foucault is saying also that such a possibility calls for judgment, analysis, consideration on the part of other workers in knowledge. That the validation of the possibility cannot restore what Benjamin calls the fortunate essence of language should be quite evident: so long as one recognizes that there is such a thing as knowledge, alas there is no disinterested language. Those observations comprise the rational ele- ment of Foucault's relevance to Western cultural radicalism and also to the radical nationalism of the non-Western world. Foucault's support of these two disparate movements has been unstinting, but he has never, and hopefully will never, take the step of sub- stituting agitation dominated by undigested philos- ophies of unrepeatable revolution for study and analysis conceived of as making differences within the order of repetition. Notwithstanding Sartre's profoundly ill-considered attack on Foucault (in 1966) for his alleged anti-historical attitude, Fou- cault has been concerned with what men have made with what they have. If what they have is "doxolog- ical" there is no reason whatever for saying conse- quently that because a doxology is maintained on a level of its own (the archive), it is therefore outside of history. Quite the contrary. Archeology has sought to describe systematically the systematic exchanges between knowledge and the historical conditions which gave rise to it. If system here is repetition, we can be expected to examine first the need for repeti- tion (in laws of exclusion that society has always employed), and then we can go on to investigate whether what has been excluded has impoverished a large part of society justly or unjustly. One can work rationally on this basis, and historically as well, for to be concerned with knowledge is to be of his- tory without being uniformly subject to its repeated illusions. diocritics/Summer 1974</page></plain_text>
