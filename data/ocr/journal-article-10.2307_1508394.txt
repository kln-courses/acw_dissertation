WILLIAMS' recent study on The Norman Anony- mous of 00oo A.D., published as an extra number of this Review,1 may be taken as an excuse for delving once more into the highly suggestive pamphlets of this anti-Gregorian royalist. In a para- graph headed Christus per naturam, Christus per gratiam Dr. Williams, able and stimulating, discusses the Christology - per- haps we should say: political Christology - of that courageous mediaeval publicist,2 thereby commendably calling attention to a hitherto somewhat neglected topic: the bearing of Christology on the relationship between Church and State.3 It is, however, not the christological aspect of the natura-gratia problem which will be dealt with in the following pages, but the historical and doxographic sides of it. Dr. Williams, it is true, has indicated the immediate, or possibly immediate, sources of his author's political theories, but it would have exceeded by far the proper tasks of his analysis to trace every theorem back to its origins.4 Although the building up of an unbroken catena philologica is 1George H.

In the present "Note" the discussion of many a problem that might have been interesting and even essential, has been omitted or sidestepped. I have consciously avoided embarking on interrelated problems, all of them subtle and complicated, and have preferred to concentrate on the one question which the title indicates. Besides the obligations acknowledged in the footnotes I wish to thank Professor Harold F. Cherniss for many fruitful conversations, suggestions, and improvements; for similar courtesies my thanks go to Professor Arthur D. Nock and Dr. George H. Williams, both at Harvard, to Professor Ludwig Edelstein, at Johns Hopkins, and Professor Theodor E. Mommsen, at Princeton University. 'Williams, 128ff. 3 See Williams' Foreword, p. vii, for the original title of his doctoral dissertation. Meanwhile Dr. Williams has elaborated this problem in his study "Christology and Church-State Relation in the Fourth Century," Church History, XX, 1951, No. 3, PP. 3-33, No. 4, PP. 3-26, in which he touches also upon the problems discussed in the present "Note." 4 Williams, 57f, nos. i68ff, has collected the parallels within the writings of his author and has indicated several relevant antecedents.</page><page sequence="2">254 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW not intended here either, it may yet prove not quite useless to spread out in the present paper some material, casually collected and perforce incomplete, which might elucidate the adaptation to Christian thought of an axiom of Hellenistic political theory. The crucial sentence to which Dr. Williams' chapter-heading alludes is found in the tractate De Romano Pontifice, but its essence is rendered more concisely in the tractate De Consecra- tione Pontificum et Regum in which the Norman Anonymous puts forth with greatest vigor his ideas about the proportions prevailing between the divine power and the royal power.5 "The king's power is the power of God, but it is God's by nature, the king's by grace." " Although a line of distinction has been drawn between divine power and royal power, that clear distinction itself will turn out to be extremely useful for blurring the borderline between divine and royal powers; it will be peculiarly useful to the Anonymous for exalting the king and proving, in the first place, his vicariate of Christ. For the author logically continues: Also, the king is Deus et Christus, but by grace; and whatsoever he does, he does not simply as a man but as one who has been made Deus et Christus by grace; and even he who is Deus et Christus by nature, does what he does through his vicar through whom vicariously he acts.7 'Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Libelli de lite, III, 662ff. I shall quote this tractate simply by quoting page and line. 6667,36f: "Potestas enim regis potestas Dei est, Dei quidem est per naturam, regis per gratiam." ' 667,37-40; "Unde et rex Deus et Christus est, sed per gratiam, et quicquid facit non homo simpliciter, sed Deus factus et Christus per gratiam facit. Immo ipse, qui natura Deus est et Christus, per vicarium suum hoc facit, per quem vices suas exequitur." For Deus factus, see, e.g., Augustine, De fide et symbolo, c. 9, PL., XL, 189: "Non enim sunt naturaliter dii, quicumque sunt facti atque conditi ex patre per Filium dono Spiritus sancti."

XII al principio del XIV," Miscellanea Paschini, Rome, 1949, II, 1-37.</page><page sequence="3">DEUS PER NATURAM, DEUS PER GRATIAM 255 In a preceding section of the same tractate the author examines the position of kings and priests according to the Old Testament. He quotes (quite traditionally, as will be seen presently) the versicles Exodus,22,28 ("Diis non detrahes et principi populi tui non maledices"), and Psalms,81,6 ("Ego dixi: dii estis"), in order to conclude that both the anointed king and the anointed priest were through their anointment dii or, as he puts it, were Deus et Christus. He stresses explicitly that those anointed on earth are Deus et Christus not only according to name (nomen) but also according to essence (res): Nam nisi rem haberent, falso designarentur hoc nomine (sc. dii et christi) .8 The anointed participate in the divine name and essence, though not without some restriction; they participate not by nature but by grace, since only Christ, Son of God and Son of man, owned both (name and essence) by grace as well as by nature. For he is God by nature and deified by none, is holy by nature and sanc- tified by none. But I said also "by grace" because according to his human nature he is deified and is sanctified by the Father.9 Thus enters Christology into the picture only to be carried over, in an unusual fashion, to the royalist theory. For now the Christ- like anointed on earth is, so to speak, bound to receive his two natures, too. At the anointment, says the author, the spirit of the Lord and his deifying power "leaped" into the anointed (insiliebat in eos) changing them into different men. In that moment, and from that moment on, they become truly "figure and image" of the God-man (Christi figura fierent et imago), inasmuch as the anointed on earth now becomes a gemina persona, that is, one person by nature, the other by grace. . . . In view of one person he is, by nature, an individual man; in view of the other he is, by grace, a Christus, that is a God-man.10 s 665,17-23. S665,24ff: "... non tamen per naturam, sed per gratiam, quia solus Christus, filius Dei et filius hominis, hoc habet et per gratiam et per naturam." This argu- ment (Christ deus per gratiam) has been often discussed in earlier times and has been canvassed also by Peter the Lombard, e.g., Sententiae, III, dist. X, passim, PL., CXCII, 777f. S 664,20ff: "Itaque in unoquoque gemina intelligitur fuisse persona, una ex natura, altera ex gratia... Una, qua per conditionem naturae ceteris hominibus</page><page sequence="4">256 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW To be sure, the author himself has made a leap in his thinking, for the point of reference for nature and grace has changed. In the one case, "nature" is what makes the king equal to all other human beings, whereas "grace," which leaps into him at his anoint- ment, exalts him over all other men and makes him quasi God and Christ. Contrariwise, in the case of the God-man, "nature" indicates the higher order, that of divinity, whereas "grace" refers only to the humbled Christ in human flesh, co-equal with all other men. That the anointed on earth share also, to some extent, in the divine "nature" is a different matter; for through the New Cove- nant those anointed become "more certainly and more truly par- ticipants of the divine grace and nature." They become "one with God and Christ by the spirit of adoption," they are dii et christi per adoptionis spiritum. Again the author has made a leap in his argumentation, and a significant one it is. "Adoption," which has here taken the place of "grace," is normally understood to be accomplished by the baptismal unction. Hence, what in fact was meant to distinguish every Christian and to make every Christian a "king and priest," now has been appropriated as a special priv- ilege of those anointed at the rites of consecration and ordina- tion." In other words, a ritual act which refers to Christians in general, has been reduced to appear as a purely royal and priestly prerogative, a method of twisting which can look back to a long line of ancestors. The Norman Anonymous, however, prefers to employ his for- congrueret, altera qua per eminentiam deificationis et vim sacramenti cunctis aliis precelleret. In una quippe erat naturaliter individuus homo, in altera per gratiam Christus, id est Deus-homo." This is the mediaeval version of the later Tudor theory of the King's two Bodies (natural and politic); see F. W. Maitland, "The Crown as Corporation," Selected Essays, Cambridge, 1936, 104-127, and my forth- coming study on that subject. " 667,2ff. For the consortes divinae naturae, see 2 Peter,I,4.

In the tractate De Romano Pontifice he discusses once more the investiture problem and defends the custom according to which the king invests the bishop with the temporalia. For when the king grants the investiture he is not a layman that grants it, but the christus Domini. That is, a christus Domini ruling by grace together with him (per gratiam ei conregnans) who is Christus Dominus by nature. . . . Verily, that christus per gratiam, the king, serves the Christus per naturam.12 Here the king's character of christus per gratiam leads not only, as often it does, to a vicariate of Christ 13 but to a "throne-sharing" with the Christus per naturam - the king by grace a synthronos of the God. The arguments of the Norman writer may be startling but they are startling only in their application to the Church-State struggle of post-Gregorian Europe and their integration into a complex system and a well-proportioned edifice of mediaeval royalism. Apart from that, his arguments have their set place within a very long tradition. The special variety of the antithesis of nature and grace as exhibited by the Anonymous is the essential factor of his system. His antithesis is not the customary one which restores man to his original nature and therewith to immortality. This version, of course, forms the theme of Ephesians,2,3-5: "By nature we were children of wrath. . . . But God . . . has quickened us together with Christ: by grace ye are saved." It is the theme also of St. Augustine's treatise De natura et gratia and his other anti-Pela- gian writings."4 But it does not describe the antithesis favored by the Norman author. According to his version "nature" is not used in the lower sense of something in need of being remedied 12685,42ff; 686,4. 1 See also 668,39: "Nec puto quod aliquis iustius debeat ea prerogare quam Christus ex natura per Christum ex gratia, sanctus ex natura per sanctum ex gratia."

Nature appears as the higher quality (God by nature) and grace as the lower (god by grace). The views of the Anonymous have antecedents. In an address to the bishops assembled at Ravenna, in 877, Pope John VIII referred to the events of Christmas 875 when he elevated Charles the Bald to the imperial dignity. The pope, for reasons closely connected with the political situation at that time, chose to bestow rather highflown titles upon his protege. He referred to him as the christus whom God anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows (Psalms,44,8; Hebrews,I,9), a prince "constituted by God as saviour of the world" (a Deo constitutus salvator mundi),`5 and then explained to what effect God had established Charles as the prince of his people: ad imitationem . .. veri Regis Christi filii sui . . . , ita ut quod ipse [Christus] possidet per naturam, iste [imperator] consequeretur per gratiam."1 Pope John's oration was not to fall into oblivion. It found its place in at least two canonical collections: in that of Anselm of Lucca the earlier redaction of which may fall in the year Io83, and in that of Cardinal Deusdedit, written between xo85 and io87.17 Other canonical collections may contain that document, too. At any rate, there is evidence that the address of Pope John VIII was known to two prominent contemporaries of the Norman Anonymous, and it may have attracted the attention of others as well. The similarity between the address of Pope John and the argu- ments of the Norman publicist is striking. The papal formula, 1 For the political situation, see Williams, 58, n. 169; P. E.

All that was implicitly expressed by the Norman writer as well; but it is said more powerfully by the pope and it adds some new flavor to the formula contrasting divinity by nature and divinity by grace."8 That formula was applied by Pope John VIII to kingship: In imitation of Christ, King eternal and universal, the Carolingian emperor ascended by grace to a dignity which Christ owned by nature. Such reference to kingship was unwarranted by the natura-gratia formula taken all by itself. In the Commentary on the Psalms, ascribed probably wrongly to Bede, the same topic appears in connection with the 81st Psalm, as indeed it often does. To the divine title Deus deorum (Psalms 81,1, and 49,1) the author remarks: [that refers to him] through whom all those who are not gods by nature, but become gods by grace (per gratiam dii fiunt), are deified (deifi- cantur). One is God by nature, many (are gods) by grace; one is born (a God) from the Father's substance, many have become (gods) by his grace. The distinction between "being God" and "becoming gods," which is equivalent to the papal possidere-consequi, is certainly put forth very vigorously. Then the author comments upon dii estis (Psalm 81,6), that is, ye may be gods if ye will have done what I shall order ye to do. And ye all, without exception, may be "sons of the most High - sons, that is, by adoption, and gods by grace." 19 The commentator is more cautious than the Norman Anonymous in keeping apart adoption and grace. And he certainly does 18 Above, n. 7; also 664,19f: ". . . ut in regendo populo Christi Domini figuram vicemque tenerent et in sacramento preferrent imaginem."

In other words, he talks about Christians in general, about the justi et deificati, whereby the "deification" again refers to Man in general.2' Nevertheless, the interpretation of dii in the restricted sense of kings and princes must have existed and even have been fairly common, as may be gathered from Jerome's Tractates on the Psalms. In his exposition of Psalm 8i, Jerome says epigram- matically: Quod dii sumus, non sumus natura, sed gratia.". And he adds: God did not say: "I have said: ye are gods" with regard to kings and princes, but to all: to all those to whom I have equally given body, soul, and spirit,23 I have given also equally divinity and adoption. Equally we all are born, emperors and paupers. '?Nor do others; see, e.g., Augustine, De fide et symbolo, c. 9 (above, n. 7), and Enarratio, XLIX (above, n. 19). Cassiodorus, one of the sources of Pseudo- Bede, says in the Expositio in Psalterium, XLIX, i: "Dii dicuntur homines, qui bonis conversationibus gratiam supernae Majestatis accipiunt... Ita ergo filii dicuntur sicut et dii, quia utrumque gratia praestat utique, non natura"; and similarly LXXXI, 6: "(filii) per gratiam utique, non per naturam," since only Christ "proprie dicitur Dei Filius" whereas the others are sons only Kar' dvaXo'ylav; PL., LXX, 348D, 594CD. Also Justin Martyr, Dialogus, c. 124, ed. E. J. Good- speed, Die diltesten Apologeten, Gbttingen, 1914, 245, stresses the fact that all men may become sons of God; to Irenaeus, Adv. haer., III, vi, i, ed. Harvey, II, 22, those having received the grace of the adoption appear as the "gods." It would be easy to collect similar places in great numbers. 21Pseudo-Bede, In Psalt., XLIX, PL., XCIII, 74oB: "Deus deorum, id est Deus iustorum, Deus deificatorum. Si enim est iustificans, est et deificans, quia de iustis dictum est: 'Ego dixi: Dii estis.'" The Justification betrays Augustinian ideas; see Enarratio, XLIX, 2, PL., XXXVI, 565: "Manifestum est ergo, quia homines dixit deos, ex gratia sua deificatos, non de substantia sua natos. . . Qui autem iustificat, ipse deificat, quia iustificando filios Dei facit." 22" Tractatus in Librum Psalmorum, LXXXI, i, ed. G.

Erich Dinkler, Die Anthropologie Augustins, Stuttgart, 1934, 255ff; also F. E. Brightman, "Soul, Body, Spirit," Journal of Theological Studies, II, 1901, 273ff, for the Eastern liturgies; the trichotomy, however, is found also in the West despite later "emenda- tions"; see, e.g., H.

In fact, Eusebius, when discussing the 81st Psalm, thinks of the Oo0 mentioned therein in terms of 7jyoYzVfEVOL Ka t pxovrTE, and so did others.24 Even Chrysostom would answer the question "Whom does he call gods in that place?" with "The rulers." 25 Jerome, of course, did not polemize against Eusebius, but against a common opinion, whereas the one man against whom he really struggles throughout, Origen, is far from giving so much as a thought to kings or princes. Origen, who actually seems to have fathered the conventional interpreta- tion of Psalm 8 (contrasting, in that place, the God by nature with the gods by grace), may be likewise responsible for the exegesis of the word "gods" in the sense of "nothing but a name." To those created by God the name [gods] has been conferred, though not by nature, but by grace. Although they [the gods] are powerful and seem to have been given that name by grace, yet none of them is found similar to God in either power or nature.26 To expound the term "gods" as a mere name or speech, a Xoyog OX63s, was an expedient adopted also by other interpreters. Theodore of Mopsuestia, for example, says very pointedly that Eusebius, In Psalmos Commentaria, LXXXI, PGr., XXIII, 988B; see also XLIX, 2 (col. 433D): The Seventy Oeobi SKdXEoav 70rov E T PXOV7aS Kal KpiTas, ?2rep 4i'tov pCvov Oeo0.

Antonius Melissa, Loci communes, II, 3 (al.CLXXIII), PGr., CXXXVI Io2oB, apparently reproducing John Chrys- ostom, interprets Exod.,22,28, in the sense that the "gods" are the "priests" as opposed to the "princes" mentioned in the second half of the versicle; see, how- ever, next note; and, for the great variety of interpretations, the summary by J.

And Theodoret of Cyrus explains even more straightforwardly that God the creator of all has a divine nature, not the mere name [of God], whereas man has only the name "Image [of God]," but is lacking the thing itself.28 The setting over of 6'vo/a against irpay/a in that connection ex- plains why the Norman Anonymous exclaimed almost angrily: "Nisi rem haberent, falso designarentur hoc nomine." 29 We may neglect here the numerous authors who, in the midst of the christological struggles, used the antithesis of God-by- nature, god-by-grace chiefly to prove that the Second Person of the Trinity was co-equal and consubstantial with the First: the Son, like the Father, was God 4;cr-E whereas all others, "be they sons and gods on earth or in heaven," 30 were "gods" only Xadptc, or were "sons of God" only Of'crE, by adoption. This is what Atha- nasius expounds, time and again, in his Orations against the Arians; 31 and some arguments of John Chrysostom 32 and Cyril of Alexandria 33 have a similar intention. Their purpose is to show 27 In evang. Joannis, X, 35, PGr., LXVI, 76oD. See also the Scholia vetera in Joannem, X, 34, PGr., CVI, I26oCD, which come very close to Theodore's text. Since in John,Io,34, the versicle Ps.,8i,6, is quoted most authoritatively by Christ himself, the exegesis of John frequently is concerned with the interpreta- tion of Oeot. 28 Theodoret, Quaestiones in Genesim, I, 20, PGr., LXXX, io8A. 29 Above, n. 8. 3o Athanasius, Oratio I, c. 39, a quotation from I Cor.,8,5.

We may turn instead to another aspect of the problem, one which has been conjured up in the address of Pope John VIII when he declared: the emperor achieved by grace a dignity ad imitationem Regis Christi who was the true King by nature. With- out raising as yet the question how imitatio entered into that picture, it should be taken, for the present moment, simply as a fact that the very complex cluster of notions connected with imitatio Dei or homo imago Dei has been linked with the prob- lem of nature and grace; or that, biblically speaking, Psalm 81,6 (dii estis), is inextricably conjoined with Genesis,I,26: Faciamus hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem nostram. That combina- tion is fairly illustrated by Cyril of Alexandria, who, in his exegesis of the Fourth Gospel, declares that all men were adopted (by grace) to the likeness of Christ, God by nature, because images are always to the likeness of the archetype.34 Cyril, of course, does not speak of kings, he speaks of men in general. On the basis of Genesis,I,26, however, man and king become easily interchangeable. Theodoret of Cyrus, for example, discusses in one of his Quaestiones the Genesis verse and asks what it means.35 Some people, writes Theodoret, seek man's like- ness to God in an anthropomorphic conception of the deity; others hold that man's God-likeness should be sought in the sphere of the invisible, of the soul.

In other words, man is the image of God chiefly because he is ruler like God. Theodoret admits other possibilities as well, since the similitude of man with God may result also from imitations of the archetype (cl apXETv7rov /upiqLLara). Man, after a limited fashion, is a creator; he too makes images; he rules and judges in imitation of God (3ao-LXESEL ~avOpCWroV Kai KpLVEL Kara plpqo-tv ro0 NEOv); but man is imperfect in all that because God creates with- out labor and without time (8'Xa irovov KacU Xpovov), gives life to his images, and is omniscient --all of which is beyond man's abilities. These considerations lead Theodoret to his statement, quoted above, that man has only the "name" of God's image but lacks the essence. This conclusion apparently did not satisfy Anastasius Sinaita, a most popular seventh-century author, whose influence on late Byzantine and early Russian thought and art has as yet to be studied. In his Quaestiones he quotes Theodoret and reproduces the latter's text almost verbatim. However, he deviates where Theodoret declares that man has only the "name" of God's image, and instead connects the idea of man's rulership after the divine model with Psalm 81,6, and says that the kingly men, as marked out by Theodoret, are sometimes called "gods" in Holy Scripture although there is a great difference between those gods and God: "God is God by nature, man by grace." " And Anastasius con- cludes that man is to the likeness of God in view of his intellect, his free will, and his kingly rule. Concerning the emphasis on rulership Anastasius may have followed Diodorus of Tarsus whose interpretation of Genesis,I,26, has been added (probably by a later editor) to Theodoret's exegesis; for Diodorus states quite bluntly: "Anastasius Sinaita, Quaestiones, XXIV, PGr., LXXXXIX, 54Iff, esp. 544D, 545B.

According to his rulership and his power.38 This theme is echoed, even more strongly, in the West. The so- called Ambrosiaster, writing in Rome during the pontificate of Pope Damasus (366-384), likewise explains in his Quaestiones: "In dominatione imago Dei factus est homo," 39 only to go even a step further in a later Question. Man, writes he, is the image of God for the purpose that One be made quasi Lord on whom all others depend, for man has the imperium of God, as it were, as his vicar, because every king has the image of God (habens imperium dei quasi vicarius eius, quia omnis rex dei habet imaginem).40 The oscillation between the notions of man, of man a king, and of royal office could hardly be more irritating than in the case of Ambrosiaster. At any rate, by building up a doctrine of man's original king- ship and of man's essentially royal character those authors come to create a theory fluctuating between homo imago Dei and rex imago Dei. They are - perhaps with the exception of Ambrosias- ter - far from singling out the professional king as the only image of God, but their concept of "man" in general is, like that of Philo,41 avowedly royal. The idea of man's inner kingship is found everywhere in early Christian literature, and it has been expounded in a truly grand fashion, for example, by Gregory of Nyssa in his vision of man's natural imperial sovereignty, in his 38PGr., LXXX, Io8CD: IIS o e o eo eo EKv 6 ,vOpwros; Kar; 7- c6pxLKoV, Ka7pa&amp; rb eOvUtaUTLK6v.

In this re- spect not only is Ambrosiaster illuminating but so also is a brief remark of Aponius, an author of the fifth century too little ex- plored, who in his commentary on the Canticum canticorum observes: What Christ is by nature, is achieved by those whom . . he has placed as his vicars, through the image.43 Aponius thinks in the first place of the apostles, in the second of the apostles' episcopal successors, that is, of Church officers; however, the religiosissimi reges appear to him also as "vicars of God." 44 More remarkable is the fact that in Aponius' work we find "grace" replaced by "image," and we may wonder whether his version of the problem centered, as it is, in "image" and "imi- tation," does not come closer to the original strata than the Christian notion of grace. It will be appropriate, though at first glance seemingly not fit- ting, to adduce here that famous christological argument of St. Basil which later, during the controversy on images, was repeated over and over again.4" Basil, like all the other anti-Arian christo- logical champions, endeavored to demonstrate the oneness of 42 Gregory Nyss., De hominis opificio, 4-5, and In verba 'faciamus hominem' Oratio I, in PGr., XLIV, i36f, 264f.

For that purpose he avails himself, among other arguments, of a comparison with im- perial images also, and declares: The emperor and the emperor's image are not two emperors even though the same respects are paid to the image as to the emperor himself;" nor, for that matter, are there two Gods, since the identity of the Son, who is the per- fect "Image" of the Father, with the divine archetype is absolute and therefore greater than that of the emperor's image with the imperial archetype. For in the emperor's case identity of image and archetype, so far as it goes, is achieved by imitation (E.tptKi~ W^), whereas the identity of the Son with the Father - not "achieved" at all - is one by nature (vU(TLKK9).47 We face a new antithesis, that of physis and mimesis, which presumably was looming at the back of all the theorems discussed in these pages; and it leads directly to the Hellenistic origins of the nature-grace formula. The "Pythagorean" tractates On Kingship, the fragments of which have been transmitted by Stobaeus, discussed by Goode- nough, and re-edited, translated, and commented on by Delatte, were composed probably not earlier than the first or second cen- turies A.D., which does not preclude reflection of ideas of the "All that is expressed, in essence, already by Athanasius, Contra Arianos, III, 5, PGr., XXVI, 332A.B. who (333A) stresses that the oneness of the Son with the Father is oi Kar&amp; XcdpLv but according to the ousia of God which here takes the place of physis.

He (the God) is the first king and ruler by Nature [and by Being], the king only by Becoming and by Imitation. The one rules in the entire universe, the other on earth; and the one governs and vivifies all things forever, in himself possessing wisdom, the other has only under- standing within Time.50 The similarity, especially of the central section, with the Chris- tian doctrines is striking. The resemblance of thought would reach identity of thought if we disregard for the present moment the fact that there has been set over against the God and uni- versal King "by nature" a royal demi-god, not "by grace," but by "imitation." We should not forget, however, to what extent the idea of imitatio had penetrated the Christian - and Jewish - theories of kingship."5 Moreover, there is in Sthenidas' parallel- 4 Stobaeus, IV, vi, 22; vii, 61-64, ed.

The antithesis of aEI and Ev Xp6vcp, intensifying that of nature and imitation, likewise is reflected in the Christian texts.52 Moreover, the concept of the royal dii et christi and of kings as mediators between God and men is marked out very clearly in all the Pythagorean political tractates. Diotogenes, for example, another Pythagorean, holds that the God-imitating king, who himself is the Animate Law, "has been metamorphosed into a deity among men" - of course not by grace, but by mimesis."3 And Diotogenes resumes also the theme of physis and mimesis when he contrasts the God, who "by nature" is the best of all things most honored, with the king, who "by imitation" is best on earth and among men.54 Other parallels are frequent and suggestive. We are reminded of the Norman Anonymous and his distinction between the king as an ordinary individual man and the king as Deus et Christus by grace when we read how Ecphantus, a third Pythagorean, ex- plains the geminate nature of his king:"5 Commentaries on the Jacobite Liturgy, Oxford, 1913, 35, cf.

He is like other men in his tabernacle,"56 inasmuch as he is formed of the same material; but he is fashioned by the supreme Artificer, who in making the king used himself as archetype. Ecphantus thus establishes also a king of two bodies or two natures, one human and the other god-like - again, not godlike by grace, but by mimesis. In addition to that Ecphantus availed himself of the stratagem to claim for the king exclusively what normally would refer to man in general, a method not dissimilar to that applied by the Norman Anonymous when he represented the ordinary baptismal unction and "adoption" as though it implied a special privilege of his royal and priestly anointed." Ecphantus borrowed the second sentence of the afore-mentioned passage verbatim from an- other Pythagorean, Eurysus, who was quoted by Clement of Alex- andria.5s But Eurysus, in his IIEp' r Xas, does not talk about kings at all, he talks about man: Man is like the others (sc. created beings) in his tabernacle, inasmuch as he is formed of the same material (sc. as the animals); but he is fashioned by the supreme Artificer, who in making him (man) used himself as archetype." In other words, Eurysus said that the Demiurge created man to his own image and likeness, a concept for which he may have drawn inspiration from various sources, most likely however from Genesis,I,26.59 Ecphantus, while taking over that statement ver- 8 For TKivos and its equivalents, rendered by the Vulgate (2 Ptr., 1,13-14) as tabernaculum and meaning the dwelling place of the soul, which is the body, see Delatte, 181.

Stratagems of that kind were rare in classical times when texts were not synonymous with absolute authority; and even the Jewish interlocutor supporting Celsus against the Chris- tian exegesis complains that scores of prophecies had been claimed for Jesus, or by Jesus, which might just as well have been claimed to refer to countless others."6 This tendency to establish and then to monopolize claims was daily bread in mediaeval thought, when words of the Bible were applied and adapted and turned around as circumstances demanded, on the greatest scale by Joachim of Fiore. More relevant to the present problem is a phrase of Petrus de Vinea, the imperial logothete and court orator, who in his great eulogy on Frederick II praised his emperor as the one quem supremi manus opificis formavit in hominem. What he did was merely to twist by a new application Genesis,2,7: Formavit Deus hominem; but since Vinea certainly did not want to proffer a truism, he evidently wished to imply that his emperor exclusively and by special privilege had been formed by the hand of the supreme Artificer himself."' Or, the most famous example of those twists, i Cor.,2,I15: Spiritualis iudicat omnia, et ipse a nemine iudicatur. By a process, as tortuous as it is revealing, that verse in which St. Paul demonstrates the inner sovereignty of man en- dowed with the Spirit, supposedly came to mean (and in practice it did mean and still does) that the pope exclusively was that pneumatikos to whom the Apostle referred, and that he alone owned, in a forensic sense, the privilege of judging all and being judged by none.62 This twisting method of "monopolizing by O Origen, In Celsum, I, 50, ed.

It is a method of putting office above man, indicating at the same time the shift from man to office. The wheel turned full circle only when, with Dante, "Man" himself, or "being Man," became an office. A related method of twisting, and of changing application, may be observed in view of the dii of the Old Testament, and thereby some light will be shed on the natura-gratia formula so closely connected with the "gods." Clement of Alexandria, when referring to Psalm 81,6, interprets "gods" as those endowed with pneuma or gnosis,63 those who are made perfect and therefore immortal," and he styles those human "gods" the synthronoi of the Saviour, ranking them with or after the angels.6" Occasionally he illus- trates the words of the 81st Psalm by quoting Empedocles on the sages that become gods,66 just as on another occasion he ex- plains man's becoming like unto God by quoting Heraclitus: "6Stromata, II, xx, 125, 5, and IV, xxiii, 149, 8, Stdihlin, II, 181, 314; see also Protrepticos, XX, 123, Stiihlin, I, 86, I8.

For the equation with angels, see also Friedrich Andres, "Die Engel- und Diimonenlehre des Klemens von Alexandria," R6mische Quartalschrift, XXXIV, 1926, i3iff; Williams, 162, n. 548. The idea, widely spread in the East and especially in the early Church, was that Christ himself represented the "God of gods" with regard to deified men ("gods") who shared the throne with him; see, e.g., Irenaeus, Adv. haer., III, vi, i, ed. Harvey, II, 22; Athanasius, Contra Arianos, I, c. 39, PGr., XXVI, 92f. The idea is found also in the West: Augustine, Enarrat. in Ps., XLIX, i, PL., XXXVI, 565 (with regard to the dii facti); Cassiodorus, Expos. in Ps., XLIX, PL., LXX, 348D ("Deus autem deorum est Dominus Christus").

Rufinus tells a spurious story about Constantine the Great who allegedly addressed the bishops assembled at Nicaea as "gods." 69 Pseudo-Isidorus, in the forged letters of Popes Anacletus, Marcellus, Melchiades, and others, repeats Rufinus' statement, styling the bishops now quasi ex cathedra "gods." 70 Finally, Pope Nicholas I allows dii to refer to the pope: ". .. pontificem quem constat a pio principe Constantino Deum appellatum, nec posse Deum ab hominibus iudicari manifestum est." Nothing could be more telling than the new twist from the plural pontifices to the one Roman Pontiff, and from the "gods" to the one God "who obviously cannot be judged by man."

This is true also with respect to the "God-by-nature, god-by-grace" for- mula which customarily was connected with the dii of the 81st Psalm. The usefulness of that formula for political theory hinged, of course, on the interpretation of dii in the sense of kings. That was originally not the case. It is true that the contrast of physis and mimesis, which in the last analysis is Platonic,73 was adapted by the Pythagoreans to political theory as a means of harmonizing the state with the cosmos, of attuning men to the king, and the king to God, and thereby also of exalting the king and making him for cosmic reasons as similar as possible to the godhead."4 The Christian version of the physis-mimesis contrast had orig- inally nothing whatever to do with political ideas. The attuning of earth to heaven was achieved by other means, chiefly through the liturgy, whereas the new physis-charis formula served differ- ent purposes. Origen, who may have introduced that formula to explain those puzzling dii of the Old Testament, used the con- trast of nature and grace for apologetic ends; and it retained its apologetic character also when applied to christological thought as a defense and weapon against Arians and other heterodox. The formula then served, above all, to demonstrate that Christ was truly "God by nature" and not identical with that plurality of "gods" who, if they were gods at all and not by name only, were Christian "sons of adoption" or "gods by grace."

To summarize, the mediaeval formula of "God by nature, gods by grace," which has been thrown into focus by the twelfth-cen- tury Norman royalist, goes back to the Pythagorean or Hellen- istic antithesis of "God by physis, god by mimesis," which the post-classical or late antique philosophers have combined with their theories on kingship. To what extent certain other and older distinctions - ~;(o-EL EOt and OE'o-EL NEO, men immortal and gods mortal, man a terrestrial mortal god and god a celestial immortal man 75- would demand consideration cannot be decided here. The way, however, in which Clement of Alexandria quoted the Heraclitean 'vOpro&amp;CoL EO , OEOL tvOponTroT, and Athanasius, follow- ing St. Paul (i Cor.,8,5), introduced the sons of God and gods ELTE EITL Y1, EL E ip ovpavoZi allows us to wonder whether those older distinctions, even though expounded in a new non-dialectical and more appropriate fashion, may not have been contributive, too.76 At any rate, in the antithesis of "God-by-nature, gods-by- grace" we have to recognize the Christian equivalent of at least one aspect of pre-Christian deification, deification by mimesis.77 It is certainly not the only political theorem which survived dur- ing the Middle Ages by transference.78 The "transference" itself, however, demands a few words of comment. How did the Hellenistic mimesis change into the Chris- tian charis, or how did imitatio enter into the natura-gratia scheme? One has to start from the dogmatic truism that man 7`The relevant places have been collected by Bywater, in his edition of Hera- clitus, Oxford, 1877, 26f, and by R.

Not by his proper nature, but by divine grace does man become like God. Apart from the deification from above, however, it is in man's proper power to become and be like God by imitation of the Godhead, whereby the notion of mimesis implies not merely active imitation, but also "ontologically" the Being like to God as the Living Image of the Deity. Hence the two notions of gratia and imitatio, appear- ing so often almost interchangeable, are in fact interrelated through the medium of imago Dei. Man the Image of God is the fundamental idea which charis and mimesis have in common and to which they can be reduced. There is hardly a difference be- tween eikon and mimesis, just as in charis the idea of ElKOW ro0 NEOv is included. Gregory of Nyssa's XPLcrtLavL-rItOq Ero-rTL 7,q OEla' cr&amp;o)~  o-t1t3 79 is probably the formulation bringing us as close as we can hope to come to determining the transition from imita- tion to grace. The difference between mimesis of pagan thought and gratia of Christian thought remains nevertheless considerable. According to the Hellenistic philosophers it was an act of man's own virtue to become God-like and be the God's perfect imitator; it was an act of purely human effort and human industry: deorum virtus natura excellit, hominum autem industria, as Cicero puts it.so According to Christian teaching, however, man could not by his proper human power alone, despite his free will, hope to be re- stored to his divine Being and divine immortality: this was pos- sible by the intervention of grace only, since every natural virtue became of merely relative value without veri Dei verus cultus. Even if the possibility of a completely sinless virtuous man were admitted, writes Augustine, this man would yet be without sin, not by his own natural efforts and merits, but by divine grace." " Greg.

The idea of grace in connection with imitation and deification is found already in</page><page sequence="25">DEUS PER NATURAM, DEUS PER GRATIAM 277 In other words, the supranatural was interposed between man and his deification. And the supranatural --that is, grace - had to be interposed if redemption were to make sense. It was this antinomy of Classical and Christian attitudes which was over- come when Dante, despite his full recognition of the celestial paradise of grace, unlocked a paradiso terrestre to man's proper virtui. the Epistle to Diognetus, X,4, ed. Meecham, 86, who in his commentary (p. 134) stresses that "it is the divine grace and initiative that enables men to imitate God." On the other hand, A. D. Nock pointed out that there were many aspects of Chris- tian "imitation of God" and that the purely human efforts towards imitation were considered effective too (Journal of Religion, XXXI, 1951, 214, in his review of Meecham which unfortunately came to my knowledge only after having finished the present study). However, also the pagan antecedents of Christian deification had many aspects. It was the current view of pagan philosophy in the post- classical era that the philosopher or the sage shared, one way or another, the life of the gods either by his nature or by his training (see also above, n. 41). It should be stressed, however, that for Plato the 6oilwo'ts Oe? existed only Kacar 7Tr tvaar6Y (Theaet. x76B) whereas Plotinus, when quoting that passage (Enn.,II,I), omitted the modification and allowed man to become god-like or even god without such restriction (cf. 11,6). In that generalization, the Neo-Platonists certainly approximated Christian deification, a fact very strongly felt by Augustine. He fought the Platonici on the ground of their failure to make it clear that their im- mortals were, like good Christians, gods a summo Deo facti; for if the Platonists would only admit that their gods were not per se ipsos beati, there would be little difference between their teaching and that of the Christians who, in agreement with many passages of Holy Scripture, likewise called their exalted men dii (De civ., IX,23). Hence pagan and Christian deification, despite all obvious contrasts, did not appear totally incomparable, and the convergent trends might be exposed in a far more subtle and satisfactory fashion than by the essay of O. Faller, "Griechische Vergottung und christliche Vergattlichung," Gregorianum, VI, 1925, 426ff. For that purpose the most recent studies on Epicurus should be considered too, since they suggest a fellowship of the sage with the gods by some kind of homogeneity rather than as a result of supreme efforts. Further investigations in that direction might succeed in establishing a new link between pagan god-likeness and Christian deification by grace. See A. H. Armstrong, "The Gods in Plato, Plotinus, Epicurus," Classical Quarterly, XXXII, 1938, 190o-96; Norman W. De Witt, "The New Piety of Epicurus," Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, 3rd Ser., XXXVIII, 1944, 79-88.</page></plain_text>
