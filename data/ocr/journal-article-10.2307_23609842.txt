<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GANDHIAN VISION OF THE IDEAL POLITICAL SOCIETY M.V. Naidu Political Science, Brandon University, Brandon Manitoba, Canada Drawing upon the writings, the speeches, the experiments, the adumbrations and the explanations of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, one can construct the ideal typology that emerges out of the Gandhian vision of the ideal political society. But Gandhi was a "practical idealist." As such he also put forth ideas on what we may call the "transitional state," the polity that could evolve into the 'ideal political society.' In the last two articles, I discussed how Gandhism views the mod ern industrial state and rejects all its fundamental premises. In this article I shall discuss the Gandhian ideal typologies of econ omy (in terms of industry, technology and agriculture), of polity * Based upon the lecture delivered at the annual conference of the Canadian Peace Research and Education Association held at the University of Manitoba, June 1985. 68</page><page sequence="2">(in terms of structures and techniques of democracy) and of society (in terms of cultural value and social behaviour). The Ideal Industry: Gandhism rejects mass industrialization. The ideal industry it proposes is the "basic industry" that is smallscale depending upon indigenous resources, investments, labour and consumers. Such "cottage industries" would be labour-intensive but not capital and technology intensive. The productivity of ba sic industries, symbolically called khadi industries (literally, khadi is home-spun handloom cloth), would be marginal and limited, not necessitating huge supplies of raw materials, not generating enormous surpluses, not depending upon millions of consumers, and not built upon the acquisition of colonies and empires, and military power and wars. The special problems of mass trans portation, mass communications and massive markets would not arise. Because "simple living and high thinking" is the basic orienta tion of Gandhism, Gandhian view of industries is not aimed at generating economic abundance, consumerism and materialism i.e., at higher "standards of livinginstead, Gandhism empha sizes reduced materialism, controlled consumerism and increased spiritualism, i.e., higher "standard of life." So the attainment of the Gandhian ideal of the khadi industry would entail a certain amount of deindustrialization in highly industrialized states, and a redesigning of economic planning in the developing countries in order to avoid the mistakes of massive industrialization. The Ideal Technology: Gandhian opposition to dehumanized science- technology is consistent with its opposition to massive in dustrialization. Instead of being the "slave" of humanity, modern technology has gained dictatorial power over the citizens of the modern state. Dehumanized technology dictates what is to be produced, of what quality, of what quantity, and most important of all, for what purpose. The answers to these questions are being determined by the capabilities of technology and the perceptions of the profiteers in the corporate sector, of the ruling class in poli tics and of the military elite, irrespective of the concerns of public health, welfare and happiness. It seems technology has developed 69</page><page sequence="3">its own logic and dynamism; human considerations have become irrelevant to technological determinism. Some of the critical problems generated by technological determin ism are - industrial pollution that damages earth, water, air and space; builtin obsolescence that is meant to create waste; artificial scarcity that manipulates prices; unscrupulous use of surpluses to pursue cold war intrigues; marketing of ill-developed and harm ful products for making the "fast" buck; gun-running, military trade and aid for the profiteering of the "merchants of death;" dumping goods or disregarding economic-technological sanctions; use of so-called foreign aid programs to create captive markets, consumerism and materialism, and so on and so forth. Gandhism rejects technological determinism and its dehumaniza tio. At an early stage, Gandhi rejected outright modern tech nology and its products including the assembly line, the train and truck, the new pharmaceuticals, etc., but later readjusted his stand to accept technology that does not. make human beings irrelevant to the machinery or the economy. At first he could accept only the simple charkha (the manual spinning wheel) that could be oper ated by one individual. But later he was willing to accept the am ber charkha that did the job of six persons thereby adding to one's productivity and income. The nature, the quality, the typology, the productivity and the role of technology should be determined not by profiteers or power mongers but for human considerations in a given society at a given time. Gandhian idealism would, therefore, require a certain degree of de technologicalization of the high-tech massive industries, and would emphasize appropriate technology that is determined by native in terests for local conditions, and not by outside experts for consid erations of outside or external industry and economy. The Ideal Agriculture: Gandhian economy advocates heavy re liance upon agriculture, instead of mass industrialization. But this agriculture has to be smallscale and dependent upon local natural resources and indigenous technology. There is enough evidence in the industrialized world today to point out that agricultural sur pluses have created the curse of abundance. However, Gandhism 70</page><page sequence="4">would be deeply involved in fighting in the Third World the curse of agricultural poverty, especially food scarcity, the products of centuries of colonial exploitation and neglect. Food selfsufficiency, in the Gandhian view, would be important not only in terms of providing the basic need of the people, but also in terms of not having to depend upon imports from outside the community. Gandhian ideal, therefore, is the village economy that is selfsuffi cient in agriculture and food, and is self-regulated in the context of ecological harmony and swadesi (indigenous) goods. The Ideal Economy: Avoidance of mass industrialization or a process of deindustrialization, elimination of high technology or a process of detechnologicalization, overcoming of agricultural poverty and food insufficiency or a process of reduction in agricul tural surpluses, and the setting up of the village or local commu nity as the unit for all economic considerations or a process of de centralization of national and international agricultural-industrial technological forces - these measures would lead to the reduction or elimination of other infra-structures and factors of mass econ omy; factors like (1) mass transportation and mass media of com munications; (2) big banks, big investments, big business and big labour; (3) big military industries, military trade and aid; (4) in ternational economic rivalries in terms of seeking colonies or neo colonies, and fighting wars to gain and sustain economic hold and status in the world; (5) heavy industrial pollution leading to eco logical disasters and environmental imbalances; and (6) immoral economics necessitated by dehumanization of the economy for the purposes of profit and power for the ruling class. The ideal economy for Gandhism would be the economy that is built upon smallscale agriculture and khadi industries, based upon indigenous and appropriate technology, and tailored to make the village or local community self-sustaining and self-controlled. Such village welfare (gram uddhar) should eventually shed the evils of modern industrial economy that are endangering the very exis tence of Mother Earth and humanity. The Ideal Political System: The big state of today, the prod uct of modern industrialization, is the most powerful political sys 71</page><page sequence="5">tem that humanity has devised so far in history. Today's state is powerful because it has huge population or it controls the lives of millions; it has or it controls huge territory; it has huge mili tary capabilities; and it has tremendous economic wealth gained through economic exploitation of the peoples within and economic subjugation of foreign countries. The operational form of the state is the government, monopolistic state is big state. Big state is built upon big government. The big government is the result of certain "big" economic and political forces - economic forces like big industry, big agriculture, big tech nology, big business, big labour, big transportation, big mass me dia, big military, big corporation, big tax and big budget; political forces like big interest groups, big political parties, big elections, big law, big bureaucracy, big police, big prisons and camps, big propoganda and thought-control, big nationalism and militarism, and big wars. As the power of the big government/state keeps growing, the representativeness of the government/state becomes narrower and narrower, ending up in the authoritarian regime and the cult, of personality. The totalitarian state is the inevitable nat ural culmination of the big industrial state. In other words, under the modern industrialization, the government state has become bigger and powerful while the people have been reduced to minor role and powerlessness. Though the material standards of living of the peoples in the in dustrialized world have been raised and are being sustained at the cost of impoverishment of the Third World, the very existence of humanity is being threatened by industrial pollution and by the potential nuclear war. According to Gandhian standards, this is neither progress nor desirable achievement. Real human progress to Gandhism lies in providing citizens the basic material needs along with economic justice, social equality, political liberty, intel lectual growth and spiritual advancement of all the peoples of the world. This is sarvodaya. To Gandhism, therefore, the modern authoritarian state cannot be the ideal political system. Gandhism propounds the opposite as the ideal - a political system that consists of a small commu 72</page><page sequence="6">nity and a small territory, and that is redeemed of big economy, big military and big politics. Gandhian ideal political system is, therefore, the village republic that is economically and politically self-governed. Gandhi calls it the panchayat raj. Once Gandhi called his ideal system an ocean with a centrifugal centre occupied by the individual/village. The achievement of the ideal village republic in the Third World would mean the abandonment of the craze to copy the big indus trial state and the recreation or resuscitation of the local com munity that has existed for a long time in such societies. The establishment of the panchayat raj in the industrialized states would imply the degovernmentalization through deindustrializa tion, demilitarization and debureaucratization to achieve decen tralization of economic and political power out of the consequent social-economic forces. Foundations of the Ideal political society: A political system is not made up of constitutional documents or declarations; nor does it mean grand buildings called parliaments, secretariats and courts; nor does it mean the rituals of elections, the parades of military forces, or the waving of national flags and the singing of national anthems; nor does it mean the assumptions of democratic titles by anti-democratic dictators and their regimes. The reality of the political system is determined by the values and beliefs, attitudes and behaviours of the political leaders, the administra tive officials, the court judges, the economic managers, the school teachers, the church elders, the family members, and of the citizens at large. The political system is not simply a system of govern ment, but also a way of life. In other words, culture (especially political culture) and socialization (especially political socializa tion) determine the reality of the political system by shaping its nature and its traditions, its achievements and its aspirations, and its stability and its growth. The cultural atmosphere and the so cial soil selects and germinates the seeds of a particular political system, while political socialization fertilizes and nourishes the political plant to grow, blossom forth and to fruition. The Gandhian political ideal of self-sufficient and autonomous vil 73</page><page sequence="7">lage republic cannot be achieved without the ideal society that has been built upon certain cultural values and social behaviours. The following five elements could be considered as the fundamentals of the Gandhian ideal society: satya (Truth), Prema (Love), Seva (Service), Sarvodaya (Universal Wellbeing) and Ahimsa (Nonvio lence). Truth is God: At one stage of his life, Gandhi propounded that "God is Truth." After some "Experiments with Truth" (the title of his autobiography), he altered his position in 1926 and said that "Truth is God." Starting with the theological premise, Gandhism evolved the philosophical proposition. Theology prescribes the Truth; philosophy postulates a hypothetical absolute. Theology, built on blind faith, has to be monolithic and hence dogmatic in its goal, in its path to that goal, in its instruments, agents and methods; philosophy, that rests on reason and exploration, can be pluralistic and open-ended in everything. Gandhi espoused the Hindu concept of God. This has confused some protagonists of religionism. In contrast to the theological, anthropomorphic and personalized God enshrined in the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, the Hindu God is a concept of metaphysical explanations, a postulate of pluralistic exploration and a code of ethical enunciations; Gandhi sometimes called truth the "Inner Voice." Hinduism, in fact, should not be considered a religion as understood in the West; in its essence, Hinduism is a compilation of different systems of philosophies and ethics, ranging from aetheism, agnosticism and materialism to naturalism, poly theism and monotheism. Viewed in this context, Gandhi's god is not the creation of theological limitations, or the crusader for religious dogma, or the prisoner of parochial prejudices." Gandhi's God is an open-ended hypothesis for a universalist and humanist explanation; Gandhi's God is a concept of truth. The Gandhian concept of truth being God, indeed, provides a framework of philosophical and social analyses. If God represents the hypothetical absolute that is ultimate, universal and eternal, and hence the ideal, towards which everything moves, then any truth, whether metaphysical or mathematical, ethical or economic, 74</page><page sequence="8">political or polemical, could be tested on the touchstone of this hypothetical absolute purpose ( telos); this teleology provides the broad- ranged standard of analysis that could be applied across classes, regions and cultures. Another implication. In this analytical scheme truth is a human concept, and as such it is subjective, relative and relatively ten tative. Yet these limiting attributes do not permit negativism, cynicism or skepticism, because human purposiveness lies not in attaining the truth, but in constantly trying to define and refine our concepts of truth through all possible searches, experimenta tions and verifications. As in science, every established concept of truth in human knowledge is truth, until it is disproved. Once the existing concept is disproved, then we must be willing to discard it, to accept the new concept and to start a fresh line of enquiry. This scientific spirit and philosophical approach imparts to all hu man endeavours the qualities of positiveness, purposiveness and dynamism. In this sense Gandhism is an optimistic philosophy of life, in contrast to the pessimistic view of human nature that considers humans as the products of original sin, condemned to damnation, or that all human beings, in Hobbesian language, are "short, nasty and brutish." Truth Needs freedom: The Gandhian approach to truth also means that the scope for new questions and the opportunity for new experiments should always be present if human concepts of truth are not to become strangulated with conformism or dogma tism. Stagnant concepts negate the unending search for truth. The questioning attitude and the experimental approach to truth demand an environment that provides and guarantees the freedom to think, to speak, to write, and to express oneself in support of and in opposition to the existing truths, their spokesmen and the political authorities behind them. These freedoms, in turn, rest upon other freedoms - the freedom of movement, association and assembly; of voting, becoming political candidates and conducting election campaigns, and of guarantees of fair and just procedures of the government assuring due process, rule of law and equal protection of the law. 75</page><page sequence="9">Truth demands equality: If Gandhian truth can be interpreted to be a human concept, then we may ask, which human being is capable of such conceptualization? Is this capacity available to all or many? or is it limited to one or some who represent a particular class, caste, or community? sex, status or society? race, religion or region? nationality, nation or nation- state? Gandhism is catholic and broad-minded in all its perspectives. It does not prescribe or ascribe or approve any form of discrimination or inequality. To the Indian masses Gandhi explained his commitment to human equality in his inimitable style arguing in the Upanishadic idiom that all human beings are the divine sparks coming out of the Great Divine Flame; sharing such divinity, how could any one be evil or inferior? Gandhian concept of equality is not to be reflected in simple ma joritarianism, or in shutting off individual dissent. A simple arith matical counting of individual heads or mechanical votes may not represent either Rousseau's General Will or an agreement on any concept of truth. Consensus, resulting from mutual exchange of ideas and opinions, peaceful persuasion or satisfying compromise, is a better measure of equality and a better indicator of mutual respect based on equality. "Majority tyranny" that is justified on basis of numbers in the mass democracy of today, seriously undermines the concept of equality. To make equality meaningful, individual agreement should nei ther be disallowed nor be persecuted or be counted out, because every human being, according to Gandhian view, is capable of comprehending truth in his or her own way. In democratic con text, this individualism is the very foundation for the charter of rights, which insulates and protects one person's liberties against the attack even by a majority of 99.9%. But Gandhian individualism does not propose a "tyranny of the minority" either. While advocating determination and courage for an individual to stand by his/her concept of truth, Gandhism con stantly proposes that a satyagrahi (seeker of truth) should always be open-minded towards the opposite viewpoint, should avoid any evil intention of hurting or harming or inconveniencing or exploit 76</page><page sequence="10">ing the opponent, and should be everwilling to seek meaningful compromises without sacrificing one's principles. Thus the Gandhian approach to satya (truth) implies a philoso phy that rests upon teleology as conceptualized by human mind with all its subjectivity and relativity of understanding, yet opti mistic and dynamic in its orientation, and demanding a full com mitment to fundamental freedoms and human equality. By lay ing such foundations of liberty and equality through satyagraha (truth-force), Gandhian philosophy and praxis prepared India for democracy. Truth is built on love: If every human being is capable of comprehending satya, and if we are constantly engaged in search for truth and in struggle for improving our concepts of truth, then we must undertake two basic measures: one, we must protect and preserve the life, and aid and abet the health of every human being so that the truth that he/she holds is not lost to us; this implies elimination of killing and bodily injury, disease, hunger and poverty; the other, we must always try to understand other individuals so that our concepts of truth can be tested, validated or improved. These measures need our commitment to care, to serve and to appreciate other human beings who may be the custodians of our purposiveness and the carriers of our enlightenment. Gandhi also equated love and God. Obviously one cannot care for a person whom one hates or de spises, or for whom one has no respect or affection. Love (prema) represents absence of spite and presence of respect, affection and care. Loving the fellow being is, therefore, the primordial prepa ration for a satyagrahi (seeker of truth). Satyagraha (struggle for truth) integrates liberty, equality and fraternity. Understanding implies, first of all, an open-mindedness; then a willingness to listen. Fad or fanaticism, and pride or prejudice may keep our minds closed. Lack of respect and empathy for the other person may hinder our willingness to listen. Without all of these preconditions, understanding is not possible. But understanding another person is not enough. Understanding 77</page><page sequence="11">others must be followed by an evaluation of one's own ideas and a willingness to drop our discredited ideas. Ego or fear may dissuade us from accepting the new idea. Even after accepting the new idea, we may not be able to act upon it; habit and conformism may prompt us not to implement the idea. Only love (resulting from respect and empathy or sympathy) can conquer ego or selfishness, prejudice or fear, and fads or habits. Search for truth requires love; satyagrahi needs prema. Service, an expression of love: The ultimate expression of true love is service (seva) towards the object of our love. Love is, therefore, a process of giving, sharing, caring and sacrificing. Selfish or self-centered love or self-love are terms in contradiction. In the Gandhian context, then, the concepts of "self-respect" and "self-love," advocated by psychoanalysis and psychiatry, cannot be conducive for developing love for others. Love demands sub limation of the self through self-abnegation; then and only then can love learn to share and sacrifice. Seva emanates out of prema; service cannot be an expression of selfishness, egotism, prejudice, hate, destruction or death. Universal wellbeing, the precondition for truth: The bene dictions of truth, the overwhelming presence of love, and the en nobling instrument of service cannot be confined to a particular class, or be reserved for a special group, or a chosen "people." They are elements that are relevant, meaningful, necessary and beneficial for all human beings irrespective of race, creed, religion, region, nationality or state. So any attempt at enriching one's own family or class at the cost of others, any policies of oppressing other states for the benefit of one's own state, any program causing in tellectual and cultured degeneration of other nations so as to help the development of one's own nation, are counterproductive to the very goals of one's growth, because by such activities we destroy truths, love and services that others could have contributed to our own development and wellbeing, and also because in the process of hating and destroying others, we could brutalize our own capac ities to love and to grow. There are certain simple truths that one cannot ignore: life cannot be meaningful amidst death; wealth 78</page><page sequence="12">cannot be beneficial when surrounded by poverty; development gains no advantage dealing with backwardness; happiness cannot be enthralling in an environment of tragedy; we cannot brutal ize others without brutalizing ourselves. Intelligent and farsighted persons can easily realize that economic wellbeing of every human being, the social-political satisfactions oí all states, the intellectual and cultural advancement of all nations, would prove beneficial for all human beings everywhere. This is the concept of sarvodaya, universal wellbeing, also referred to as universal love. Sarvodaya should become the very framework for mapping and measuring the wellbeing of a particular class, or people, or state. Nonviolence, the ultimate test: Violence (himsa) is, first of all, resort to physical force. The obvious purpose of such force is to inflict bodily pain or injury or death on the opponent. Be hind such violent acts there is a mental or emotional phenomenon that precedes the act and that colours the post-facto stage. The emotions that can psyche-up a person to the pitch of using phys ical force are usually roused by momentarv or long-lasting anger, hate, prejudice, intolerance, fanaticism, fear, revengefulness etc. - all factors that are antithetical to factors like understanding, respect, empathy, sympathy, affection and sacrifice which are the manifestations of love. Thus violence (physical and psychological) is antithetical to love. As ahima (non-violence) is non-use of phys ical force and of ill-will towards others, ahimsa is a derivation and a manifestation of prema (love). Cannot parents or teachers inflict corporal punishment on the child in order to bring good to the child? Cannot the society use vio lence for the wellbeing of its citizens? Cannot a state wage war to end war? In other words, cannot violence be used as a means to serve love i.e., for good ends like protection, retribution, deter rence, discipline etc.? This question poses the age-old dichotomy of "means" and "ends." At the early stage of his philosophical evo lution, Gandhi accepted this dichotomy by accepting nonviolence as the means for the attainment of truth, the end. The Gandhian argument at this stage was that one cannot reach good/ moral ends with bad/immoral means, because the means in some way colour and shape the ends. At a later stage, Gandhi changed his focus; 79</page><page sequence="13">he postulated that ahimsa (nonviolence) is both the means and the end, thereby eliminating the dichotomy between means and ends. On this logic, Gandhian concept of ahimsa became merged with prema (love), thereby ahimsa became enriched in content and quality. With nonviolence anything and everything is possi ble and acceptable; without it, nothing meaningful or moral can be attained. That is, truth develops and survives through non violence; search for truth is impossible with violence. Concepts of truth could rise, change or disappear as search for truth keeps going, but nonviolence cannot be reduced, altered or discarded. Nonviolence is the sine qui non for all other concerns - economic, social, political, ideological, intellectual, aesthetic, moral and spir itual; death or hate is the negation of all human concerns. As expressions of love, service and sacrifice (sera) cannot be the fruits borne to death, destruction or hate. Ahimsa is the force that generates the qualities of mercy, generosity and caring. Thus nonviolence is also the foundation for service. The willingness to work for general good and the wellbeing of all humanity without discrimination (i.e. sarvodaya) needs atti tudes of sharing, habits of sacrificing, values of fraternity, policies of peaceful relations and non-use of violence - all reflections of nonviolence. So sarvodaya is possible only through ahimsa. In short, the fountain-head and the cornerstone for the elements of truth, love, service and universal wellbeing is nonviolence. Ahimsa can thus be seen as omnipotent, universal and eternal force of life; hence it should be the focus of all things for all human beings. Perhaps this logic drove Gandhi to postulate that ahimsa is the most important consideration, the final test, the ultimate justifi cation for everything, and the supreme truth that should be the goal, the motivation and the methodology for all seekers of truth (the satyagrahis); Gandhi pleaded for the "sovereignty of ahimsa." Conclusion: The ideal typologies that I have derived from Gand hian vision of the perfect society, economy and polity, puzzle and confuse the critics of Gandhism. Many critics consider Gand hian plans as too naive and simplistic for serious consideration; most call Gandhian ideals reactionary, proposing a return to prim 80</page><page sequence="14">itive society; some critics consider Gandhian approach too saintly, demanding superhuman qualities. All these critiques could be seriously challenged, logically answered and effectively rebutted. Gandhi was no doubt a great idealist. His enunciation and ad vocacy of nonviolence was at first rejected by almost every leader and party. Still he won over all his opponents, experimented with and adapted the technique of nonviolence and proved himself the world's greatest pragmatist and history's greatest activist who mo bilized millions of immobilized masses to rise and to successfully challenge and defeat the well-entrenched British imperial power, and prepared Indians for running the biggest democracy on earth. As the "practical idealist," Gandhi also developed ideas on how to transform in a realistic manner the existing state system into his ideal society. One can develop and delineate the "transitional" state as it emerges out of Gandhi's statements and experiments. My next article will discuss the Gandhian transitional state. 81</page></plain_text>
