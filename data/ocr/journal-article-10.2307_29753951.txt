<plain_text><page sequence="1">Grundlagen Tibetischer Mystik, nach den eso? terischen Lehren des Grossen Mantra Om Mani Padme Hum (The Essence of Tibetan Mysticism, according to the esoteric teach? ings of the great Mantra Om Mani Padme Hum), von Lama Anagarika Govinda (Anangavajra Khamsuni-Wangehuk), Z?? rich-Stuttgart, Rascher Verlag, Demi-Octavo XVII+ 357 pages, 9 plates, " 4 figures, 19 diagrams, etc. Anagarika Govinda. a German Buddhist (Lama of the Red-Cap Sect) who has spent several years in Tibet and the greater part of his life in India, has become known in larger circles by his paintings of Tibetan scenery, his expedition ? in the company of Li Gotami ?- to Tsaparang 1947-48, and several books on Buddhist philosophy, psychology and sym? bolism. The book under review, though quot? ing with authority from quite a number of Mah?y?na scriptures,fundamentally represents the living tradition as imparted by his guru, Tomo Geshe Rimpoche Ngawang Kalzang, grand-abbot of the Monastery of the White Conch in the Tomo Valley who had previously been a hermit for twelve years. It represents the results of endless meditations built around the so well-known prayer formula continually muttered by practically every Tibetan, engrav? ed on millions of stones, filling other millions of ? prayer-mills ? : Om, the primordeal root, Mani the jewel of the spirit, the prima materia, the philosophers' stone, Padma the lotus sym? bol of spiritual evolution, Hum the symbol of integration, Hnn that of realization, ?h that of karma-less action on the path of the Bodhi sattvas. From each of these bijas the compli 398</page><page sequence="2">cated psychology and religious symbolism of the Yog?c?ra school is evolved starting from the same premisses as Hinay?na Buddhism, so much better known in the Occident, but developping in a very different direction, Ana? garika Govinda claims that these teachings represent the last still surviving tradition of the primary wisdom of mankind, and that his guru had willed to make these mysteries pub? licly accessible in order to save mankind from the present crisis into which a onesided mate? rialistic ideology has landed it. It is difficult to accept or to refute this claim. Many ideas of this book have been elaborated only during the last 1500, at the utmost 2000 years of Buddhist thought, and the formula Om Mani Padme Hum even belongs to a rather late stage of Lamaism. On the other hand just the ideas which distinguish the Mantray?na from the Hinay?na, of the creative force of certain syl? lables, sounds, colours, etc. and their relation to the directions of the sky, the parts of the day and the year, the senses, the elements, etc. go back to a very early philosophy, much older than the historical Buddha Sakyamuni, recur in early Vedic speculations and can in fact be traced in most religions of the stone age level. However, at the present stage of our know? ledge most of these ideas are accessible to'us only in degenerated and often no more under? stood fragments. Anagarika Govinda points out the differences between Buddhist and Hindu yoga, the supersession of the KundalinT by the DakinI, of the Sakti by the Prajn?. He refutes the vibration theory of the blja, declares yoga and tapas to be not a warping of the mind but a relaxation, a return to an inner balance. The anthropomorphic symbolism of male-fe? male polarity he explains in a purely allego? rical sense. Nevertheless one is tempted to raise the question whether this symbolic ter? minology of terrible deities, human sacrifi? ces and sexuality had not originally a very concrete meaning, such as is found in many primitive cults, including the more archaic aspects of Indian folk religion, and the secret sects of the V?ma M?rga. On the other hand there is neither a reason to doubt the very early origin of the esoteric interpretation, be? cause just in archaic religion esoterism has played a most important role. In this respect much research has still to be undertaken in the field of both Buddhist and Hindu religious thought. However, as practically all high re? ligions and philosophies build up on the foun? dations of such primordial concepts, this pro blem is not essential for the purpose of the book. It is difficult reading, but also very rewarding and may prove inspiring to a philo? sophy of the future in whiih science and (C Geisteswissenschaften ? will again be welded into one harmonious concept. Worth mentioning are also the photos of mystic shrines and statues in the monasteries of Tsaparang, Kumbum and Ghoom, most of them taken by Li Gotami. H. Goetz</page></plain_text>
