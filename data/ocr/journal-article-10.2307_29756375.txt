<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Swat. The Dards and Connected Problems by Giusep/pe Tucci with appendixes by K. Enoki and B. Brent je s on the occasion of the 65th birthday of Prof. H. Hoffmann I. Introduction 1. Discoveries of the Graves Prof. Dani published in 1967, as a special number of Ancient Pakistan (1967) the results of his important excavations in Timargarha and Balambat, The book (in collab? oration with F. A. Durrani, Muhammad Sharif and Abdur Rahman), deserves our best praises for its layout and its content; the discoveries have been carefully described and illustrated. Without entering into many details, I may be allowed to remark that a larger collabor? ation with some technologists (paleobotanists, paleozoologists etc.) might have greatly con? tributed to supply a more complete idea of how people lived in that country and in those times, what kind of seeds or trees they knew, the clothing they wore; e.g. I do not think that the dead were interred naked, but at least partially covered with pieces of woollen material. Uddiy?na, like the country of the Kambojas, was known in India from ancient times for its fine woollen blankets {kambala). That is the method followed by us in Sist?n and that now we extend to Swat, where we have discovered many prehistoric graveyards, but only one large settlement (1966) C) so far; this method is needed in order to get a more adequate idea of the ecological surroundings in those old times. During my daily wanderings in Swat, the first week of September 1957, in the collaps? ing slope of a cretaceous hillock near the village of K?telai, which was being dug by labou (*) In the following notes, which supplement my Preliminary Report, EW, 1958, I have col? lected some facts, some results of my researches, as well as some hypotheses which I submit to my disciples and my colleagues to be worked out. Indeed, mostly "working hypotheses" represent the main content of these notes: let my successors examine them, thoroughly criticize them, revise my conclusions. But I felt it my duty to send to the press the results of some researches, I dare say also some intuitions, which one may deem to be worth considering, at least partially. In conclusion, the article wants to be an attempt to put in writing some of the ideas which flashed upon me from meditations on Sw?t and its connected problems during its long period of existence. It is my duty to express my deepest thanks to Prof. L. Lanciotti of the University of Venice whom I am proud to have had as my pupil, and now is my colleague; to Prof. A. Gargano, Director of the cultural activities of the IsMEO; to Prof. Maurizio Taddei, of the Istituto Orientale of Naples, who all helped me in the research of the bibliographical material, in the revision of the text, and in valuable suggestions. Any mistake which may be discovered in the article is to be attributed only to me, always a very inefficient proof reader. (*) On the large settlement of Aligr?ma cf. now Stacul and Tusa 1975, p. 291. 9</page><page sequence="2">rers for building a house, I noticed some holes indicating the presence of tombs. My first impression was that they were Islamic; but, when I examined them closely, I found that they were not at all Islamic; they contained pottery of gray or black, occasionally of red colour, of different shapes and sizes: small and big cups, the so called brandy bowls etc. (now described by Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972). They had no relation with the pottery discovered in the Mauryan layer of Udegram. A few days later I found identical graves and potteries near Gumbatuna, on the right bank of the river, and a funerary urn in Chah?rbag to the North of Saidu Sharif. Therefore, we started the excavation of some of these graves in Butkara and K?telai near Mingora (Tucci 1958, p. 285) while the dig? ging of the Buddhist settlement was in progress. Provisionally, I called those graves prebuddhistic, pending more appropriate designation, because some st?pas are built upon them. I seize this opportunity to note that there is very frequently a connection, I should say an almost regular one, between the st?pas and the graveyards; in the sense that near every isolated st?pa or group of st?pas, which are scattered all over Sw?t, one discovers the presence of the same tombs: at K?telai, Chah?rbag, Dangr?m, Loebanr, J?mbil, Ali? gr?ma, Gumbatuna, G?gdara, provided there is the same cretaceous soil on the sloping side of a hill and some water or streamlet nearby. That is why my further localization of other graveyards has been mainly anticipated by the accurate survey of the land surround? ing the st?pas. There is no doubt that when Buddhism spread in the country, during or shortly after the time of Asoka, who has left his edicts at Sh?hb?zgarhi, M?nsehr?, and Kandahar in Afghanistan (2) the building of a st?pa on or near the graveyards was a sort of sign that the new religion was going to supersede the old one, which survived in villages or places far removed from the main trade routes and the major urban centres. 2. Name given to the Graveyards Prof. Dani calls the graveyards Gandharan. And here I raise a question. Are we really in a condition to state that Sw?t was subject to the Achaemenian administra? tion either as a district within the Satrapies or as a separate ethnic group? We know from Herodotus III 91, that the seventh Satrapy comprised four peoples that are separately named: Sattagydai, Gandarioi, Dadikai and Aparytai. Thus a single satrapy included peoples of different extraction, belonging to different or may be also related ethnical entities; some were bound to pay tributes, others to supply soldiers. The Dadikai are the Dards, the Daradas of the pur?nic geographical lists, the Daedalae of Curtius, who ? after dealing with the story of Nysa (3) (see below p. 40) and with the orders given by Alexander to Hephaisti?n and to other generals to go ahead in order to build the bridge on the Indus ? writes ? and then he went to Daedala ? {ad regionem, quae Daedala vocatur, VIII, X, 19) and narrates the events of war in that territory against the Assaken?i. (2) According to the inscription discovered by Prof. Scerrato: Pugliese Carratelli and Levi della Vida 1958 and 1964; new ed., Pugliese Carratelli and Garbini 1964. The inscription is dated ? the completion of the 10th year from coronation ?. Cf. Thapar 1961, pp. 32 ff. (3) Tucci EW 1963 p. 27-28. 10</page><page sequence="3">The province of Gandara (a.p.), Gandh?ra, ran in those times along the Kabul (4), Cophes (Kubh?, RV V 53, 9; X 75, 6) towards Puskal?vati (Arrianus [c. 95 d. 175], Indike 1, 8; Peukelatis; Peukolaitis, Strabo XV, 1, 27; Poklaeis, Ptolemaeus VII, I 44; Peu colatis, Plinius VI 62, 78 (its inhabitants being called Peucolitae), Skr. Puskal?vati, Puska r?vati, P?li PokkaravatL 3. Sw?tis and Daradas Sw?t has no doubt been under the influence of Gandh?ran culture, especially during the Buddhist period; even in later times, Uddiy?na-Sw?t presents itself, in the different periods of its history, with its own petty rulers (perhaps many of them), or under the domination of the Kus?nas, but it should not be considered as being identical with or in? cluded in Gandh?ra or in Kapisa, Afghanistan (see below pp. 75); though later it lost its independence to the Turki S?hi. The language of the Sw?tis being Dardic (see below p. 34), they were not separately named, but comprised in the denomination of Dards, generically, though the Dards were spread over a very large territory (but Arrianus knows Soastos not Souastene) (5) (see below, p. 44). Leaving aside, for the time being, the Satta gydai and the Aparytai, let us go back to Gandara in the Achaemenian inscriptions: Elam. Gan-da-ra, Kent 1958, Lexicon p. 183, 1). Already at the times of Darius, the dependence of the tribes near the extreme eastern borders of the Achaemenian empire on the Central power had become very slack (Junge 1941, pp. 5, 27 below, p. 16); moreover, the boundaries of the region we know as Gandh?ra are well delimited by Arrianus, as we shall see (below, pp. 43-45). Thus, we may conclude that Sw?t had a position by itself, as a particular ethnic group of the Dadikai, separate from Gandh?ra; the people had only to pay some tributes and to send contingents of troops, as agreed upon, in case of war. We must therefore refer to the division into districts on the basis of the tributes due (Steuer-Berzirke) or of their ethnic identity rather than on that of Satrapies. Although there is no representation of the Dadikai on the bas-reliefs of Persepolis, nor any mention of them in the Achaemenian inscriptions, there is no doubt that Dadikai, Daradas, Dards, according to the Herodotean list, were for reasons of administration, con? nected with the seventh satrapy equally subject to tribute (Herodotus VII-66). In the Pur?nic description of India, the Gandharans are listed (Kirfel 1954, pp. 116, 131) along with the Kashmirians and other N. W. peoples: ? Darad?ms ca sa-K?smiri?n Gan dh?r?n Auras?n ? (Hazara). Cf. also Sircar 1960, p. 24 and Law 1943, pp. 86. Var?ha mihira, 1895, 97 V, 29, 30 enlists them along with the Abhis?ra, Tanganakul?ta... Kir?ta, Qna. In the Tibetan work dPag bsam-ljong bzan, ed. Sarat Chandra Das, 1908, I, 9 the Dards are called Darta from Darada, Mm. 763 = T'o-lo-t'o. (4) But for another division of the territory, see below p. 42. (5) For Souastene cf. Ptolemaeus I, 42. Cf. P?nini IV, 2, 77: Sauv?stavam, name of a town. (?) 11</page><page sequence="4">Many a quotation of the Darada is found in the R?m?yana and the Saddharmasmrtyupas thana in Levi 1918, p. 48. They are the last ones in the list; along with them are the Odra = Uddiy?na, the Kuru and the Madraka (5a) (cf. ibid., p. 125). This list according to S. Levi cannot be older than the 2nd century B.C. nor later than the 1st A.D. In the Candragarbhas?tra (S. Levi, 1905b p. 263) the Daradas are mentioned near the Kia she, K?sa, Khasa. 4. Achaemenian Influence in Sw?t? Prof. Dani is of the opinion that some receptacles laid upon platforms or benches in Balambat (Op. cit. 41 and Plate XLIII a) might be fire altars and he considers them to be a testimony of the presence of Achaemenian influence. In one of them a lamp was found with traces of some burning. But I am afraid this is not a conclusive proof that those platforms have something to do with the Achaemenian religion. Those receptacles may have been connected with some cults (and fire was involved in many of them), but nothing indicates that they were fire altars. At most, I should call them family chapels; from the finds it is difficult to draw a precise conclusion; the presence of a lamp may or may not indicate their sacred character; all lamps may be employed for any domestic use. On the Indian side we know that fire worship was limited to three fire mounds (mandala) G?rhapatya, ?h?vamya and Daksin?gni, which were circular, square and semicircular respec? tively: e.g. (?pastamba-Srautas?tra V, 4). Neither can any connection be found with the pyreia discovered by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Dahan-i Ghul?m?n in Sist?n, to which Professor Dani refers. I think that even in this case it is perhaps not quite exact to call the big temple a fire temple. (See Scerrato 1966, pp. 14-15) (6): In appearance, these structures seem to be ovens; but their real purpose was simply to contain the fire and we shall refer to them as "pyraea"; they must have played a very important role in the religious and ritual practices that took place in the building. There are two parts in each pyraeum: a lower compartment of rectangular shape which was the combustion chamber, provided with a mouth for lighting, and an upper one covered with slightly pointed vault roofing in the same fashion as that of the porticoes. A clay diaphragm, supported by four corner brackets, divided the compartments which were, how? ever, inter-communicating since there was a large slot in the diaphragm to the left. The flames kindled in the lower chamber came up through this opening, seared the underside of the covering and rever? berated on to the diaphragm. The pyraea between the pillars were separated from the court by a thin wall. Opposite each pyraeum in the "aisle" facing the court, six rectangular benches were built plus a seventh, square in shape, placed in front of the point of access to this portico. Traces of com? bustion existing in small patches have been detected on them and they were clearly used as sacrificial tables or altars. The north portico has identical features ? the same number of pyraea and sacrificial benches: but a distinctive element is a cylindrical oven in terracotta embedded in a thick layer of crude clay; its appearance ? and, we think, its function ? is very similar to those of the tanur which are still used (5a) The Mo-tu-lo p. 363 are not = Mathur? but correspond to the Madras, another northern tribe. For the Mo-lo-po also S. Levi proposes Mo lo-so = M?lava ibid., p. 28. (6) Gnoli G. see addenda n. 1. 12</page><page sequence="5">in the region. Another peculiarity worth noting is the existence of very low platforms, no more than 10 cm. high, resting against the inner pillars. All these features are probably later additions, still of a ritual character. When we come to the west portico, we are faced with a quite different arrangement of the cult installations. The portico is open on the court side; but an altar-oven like those referred to in the south portico is placed against the court-facing side of each pillar of the inner row. They consist of two projecting walls with side-pieces open in front, and originally provided with a square block covering with chamfered corners and ? very probably ? a hole in the top. At least four of these are fitted with two or three steps: sometimes there is just one small stairway, sometimes two. In the first and second altars from the left, a number of cylindrical-conical goblets were found in orderly array: they belong to a type that is very common at Dahan-i Ghulaman, but they were deposited here at a secondary stage. The portico "aisle" closest to the outer wall is quite filled up by the presence of three large "tanks" measuring about 1,30 m. in height, 90 cm. in width, and 55-60 cm. in depth. The southern? most one is divided into two unequal parts by a partition. The latter tank, and the longest one, are both fitted with steps. In the corner of the third tank on the shorter side facing the court a small fireplace is to be found. The inner surface of the tanks is burnt by fire, and on the bottom of them a good deal of blackish sticky combustion remains, heaped in tiny piles, was found. Tiny fragments of burnt bones were mixed with the ashes. The whole of the pavement of the portico contained similar bone fragments both burnt and unburnt, which were also mixed with the plaster covering the portico walls ? a proof that animal sacrifice was indubitably part of the religion practised in the temple. 5. The Pyreia of Dah?n-i Ghul?m?n There is no indication that the pyreia or hearths were used for a fire kept continually burning; the triple row of fire-hearths and a tank meant for animal sacrifices, filled with burnt bones, all this seems to suggest a temple dedicated to three different deities or group of deities, (e.g. Ahura Mazda, Mithra, An?hit?, cf. the three groups of gods: Vasus, Rudras, ?dityas SB. 14, 1, 1, 15). This implicitly would also seem to indicate the probable presence of a tripartite so? ciety, each class indulging in a peculiar cult; this would agree with the well-known theory of Prof. Dumezil. The recent researches of Prof. Gonda (1976) have revealed a much wider and deeper motive underlying this triadic classification. Prof. Gonda calls it "triadic mode of thought" as a fundamental archetypal intuition of the I. Aryans. I invite the rea? der to a thorough study of the above quoted book; we may choose a few examples out of the many hundreds collected by Prof. Gonda: The Srauta Sacrifice RV. 10, 105, 9 g?rha patya, ahavariiya, daksina, Agni's three seats RV. 8, 39, 8 etc. A very important discovery, so we may call it, upon which we shall come back again. Anyhow as regards the sacred building of Dah?n-i Ghul?m?n, it certainly shows evident connections with Achae menian architecture; there is nothing in it which lends support to the theory of its being Sasanian, advanced by some scholars, as soon as the discovery was announced. Though the edifice seems to belong to the 6th century B.C., its typology has something unique in it; all this leads me to suppose that we are confronted with a cult which did not object to the slaughtering of particular animals, and that did not request a perpetual burning of fire. It is quite possible that in these regions, at the extreme boundaries of Iran, there had descended some Indo-Aryans (later submerged by or conquered by an Iranian wave) 13</page><page sequence="6">still having particular cults which might show some affinities with certain Vedic rituals as described in the Br?hmanas (7). But I do not want to trespass in this paper on the field of my collaborators, and discuss archaelogical problems. Up to now Dah?n-i Ghul?m?n stands unique; more than a provincial expression of a well-defined religion, it may be considered as a document of some religious background which is yet unknown in its real context. When exploration will be extended to Afghan Sist?n or as well as to Khor?s?n, there is the chance to verify if this hypothesis proves wrong or corresponds to real facts. For the time being, I may only say that also Prof. Shippmann, after reading the preliminary report of Prof. Scerrato, seems to conclude that the temple of Dah?n-i Ghul?m?n stands by itself (8). 6. The Graves of Sw?t and the Assakenoi; Shifting of Tribes Prof. Dani disagrees with my stating that the tombs discovered by the Italian Mis? sion in Sw?t belong to the Assakenoi of the classical authors. Of course, I agree that the expression does not exactly express my thought: I only wanted to say that the graves disco? vered in Sw?t were to be attributed to the people against whom Alexander fought: at the time of his invasion, they were partly Assakenoi, but certainly they belonged also to other tribes, related or not to them. Moreover, further digging confirmed that some ce? meteries are much more ancient that Alexander's expedition (9). The Assakenoi were settled chiefly in the lower part of Sw?t (Chakdarra),then B?jaur, Buner. Their capital was Massaga. If we compare the list of Herodotus either of the satrapies or of the regions subject to the payment of the tributes by each ethnic group included in them, with the list of the peoples whom Alexander met in his expedition, we find some noticeable changes concerning this part of Asia in which we are interested: e.g. we no longer find any men? tion of the Aparytai, nor of the ?atagus (Sattagydai) nor of the Paktuike Khora (mentioned in Her. Ill, 102) along with Kaspatyros. It may be that these peoples were not in the proximity of the route followed by Alexander; it may also be that they had merged in other political and social entities, assuming a different name. Or again, they had perhaps shifted, in the lapse of time intervening from that of Herodotus to that of Alexander, from a former location to another one or possibly they had taken the name of a prevailing tribe. According to Herodotus (III, 91) the Aparytai paid together one hundred and seventy talents; they may be identified with the pouruta (Isk^tam pourutdtn of the Mihir Yost 14). Gershevitch (1959, pp. 80-81) locates them to the south of Western Hindukush, between Hairava and Gandh?ra; Marquart 1905, Eran II, 74, 175 places them to the East of Ghor. There is nothing to wonder at, because, I insist on this point, there are indications (7) See the article of Burrow 1973, p. 139, on the possibility that Iranians here superimposed themselves on a previous I.A. migration. (8) Shippmann 1971, pp. 50 ff. (9) Loebanr (first half of the 2nd millennium B.C.). 14</page><page sequence="7">that during that time there took place a movement southwards and eastwards of many tribes and new associations (10). When these waves of migrating tribes settled down, it may be that the Aparytai became the ancestors of the present-day Afridis, a suggestion advanced by Sir Olaf Caroe. The name of the leader of the confederation who tried to harass the troops of Alexander after the battle of Aornos, moving towards the bridge on the Indus, was 5AcpptX7j^ said to be the brother of Assacanos (according to others the name of the leader was Erix). The name, Assacanos (of the dead king of Massaga) is not only a proper name but chiefly an ethnic name: Afri-kes may equally well be connected with Aprita, Afridis: it seems to me that this derivation is more probable than the one proposed by Eggermont from Urdi, Aurdd?y?nl, Aurdi, Auddi (12). As regards the UaKxvsq we must recall that there is twice mention of them in Hero? dotus; once III, 95 he places them near the Armenians, an obvious mistake, and a second time near Kaspapyros (or: tyros) III, 102. ? Other Indians dwell near the town of Kasp? tyros and the Pakt?e country, northward of the rest of India: they live like the Bactrians; they are of all Indians the most warlike, and it is they who are charged with getting of gold ?. (The story of the gold-digging ants follows, on which see below.) Caroe 1958, p. 357, maintains his opinion: paktues ? pakhtun in spite of the different ideas of Bailey 1952, p. 430 based on linguistic grounds and of Morgenstierne in Encyclopaedia of Islam, s.v. ? Afghan ?. Prof. Bailey (Ibid.) suggests a connection between modern Kalash P?tu with Greek itawxmq md is skeptical about any relation between P?tu and Pashtu (12a). Marquart, Eran, II Heft, 1905, pp. 177 ff. is also of the opinion that the Ilcwttveg have no relation at all with the Pakhtun and proposes a connection of their country rccumnxr) yr\ with a Greek "Umbildung" from a Prakrit form of Puskalavatl, nevxeXaotuc, a bold but to my mind improbable hypothesis. In the Achaemenian inscriptions there is no mention of them. Junge also, 1941, p. 37, n. 7, places Paktuike in Gandh?ra: Naqs-i Rustam A. 1, 24. Zraka, Harauvatis, ?atagus, Gad?ra, Hidus, Sak? haumavarg?, Sak? tigraxaud?, Kent 1953, p. 137, Persepolis, E 1. 16: B?ktris, Suguda, (Suguda) Gad?ra, Uv?razmiy, ?atagus, Harau? vatis, Hidus, Gad?ra, Sak? (Kent 1953, p. 136, cf. ibid., Lexicon). The Sattagydai correspond to the ?atagus of the inscriptions, and this word does not mean the "(people) of seven rivers" as proposed by Hertzfeld, but most probably stands for the people "having hundreds of cattle" (Kent 1953, s. v.). It is not possible to follow Marquart, who locates the ?atagus north of Arachosia and west of Gandh?ra. (10) This subject will be discussed more in detail in another article. (n) I think that the Aparytai are the same as P?nini's ?prita {R?jany?digana) mentioned in the Ganap?tha IV, 2, 53. (12) Eggermont 1975, pp. 182 f. (12a) It is worth noticing that Morgenstierne 1973, p. 345, writes on P?t?: P?t? may be derived from P?rthau ?which may originally have been applied to a group of Parthian who found their way in Chitr?l ?. 15</page><page sequence="8">When Alexander had reached Peukel?oitis, Puskal?vati, his campaign in Sw?t had come to an end. Nearchos was going to keep ready his fleet in order to follow the course of the Indus, and then proceed to the Persian Gulf to meet Alexander there. Sky lax locates in Gandh?ra the place where, under the Achaemenians, he was ordered to achieve the same feat according to a fragment preserved by Hecataeus, M?ller, G.G.M. I, XXXV. ravSaoixfj iconic, KaojtdnvQog Sxufrcov anxr\: the short passage is very important for the mention of a place in Gandh?ra which was the akte of the Scythians. Akte is not a port, it is a shore with easy access, a bay. Kaspapyros cannot certainly be Mult?n, as proposed by Foucher, and accepted by Herzfeld. According to Foucher the name derives from that of an ancient Upanishadic seer Kasyapa: Kassaplya, Kassa&lt;pu&gt;rlyas, Kassapyros. Honigmann and Ma ricq 1953 also reject this identification. Nor can I hold valid the opinion of Marquart (Eran II, p. 246, n. 2) who supposed a derivation from Prakrit Kusuma (flower), Kus(u)vapura, Kusumapura, Puspapura, Peshawar. But Kaspapyros cannot be Peshawar, which would imply an unexplained change of the Kaspa into Paska. There is also a much more valid reason for rejecting this assumption; in this part of its course, the K?bul river is not navigable, the real navigable portion of it beginning a little westwards of Naushera. (See map of Caroe 1958, facing p. 30). After that place, affluents of the K?bul ? including the Sw?t river ? empty into this last part of it, called now Landai (13). The building of a fleet demands the storage of large-size timber, ample space, the proxi? mity of a populated town for hiring labourers, and in which plenty of iron, nails, all sorts of material for sails, implements, tools, and suchlike are available. But why was the shore where the fleet was prepared called: shore of the Scythians? Marquart places Kaspa? pyros near Puskal?vatl, and he locates the latter near the Sak? Haumavarg? quoted in the inscriptions of Darius as living on the borders of Gandh?ra to the North, between Gandh?ra and Bactria. Junge 1939, p. 60: ? Die L?nderliste in der Inschrift am Grabe Darius I. in Naqsch-i Rust?m hat als Nr. 14 and 15 hinter der indischen Gruppe Saka Haumavarg? und Saka Tigraxauda ?. Id., p. 66: ? Die Saka Haumavarg?, ferner gelegen und schwerer zu fassen treten nur auf den Throntr?gerreliefs auf, haben demnach wohl, wie schon zur Zeit des Kyros und noch zur Zeit Alexanders, nur in Bundesgenossen Verh?ltniss gestanden ?. On a settlement of the Sak? in Northern India since the time of the first Achaemenian period see Scheftelowitz 1933, p. 294. Bailey H. W. Languages of the Sakas. Handbuch der Orientalistik IV, Linguistics 1958, p. 137: ? Three groups are distinguished in the Achaemenian inscriptions. The Saka paradraya in the Pontic steppes, the Saka Tigraxauda "with pointed caps" and Saka Haumavarg? to the south-east and in the Pamirs (13a). This lat? ter name is likely to have survived in bray-i Mrung, and mung of the name Bray?go, Mr?vjgul, Mung?n for the Munj?n people closely allied to the Yidg ?. We may here recall to mind (13) Stein (1900) Ancient Geography of Kash? mir II, p. 353: ?The notice of Hekataios makes it clear that Kasp?pyros (Stein: Kasp?tyros) must have been situated in that territory where the Indus first becomes navigable ?. (13a) Cf. passage of Strabo quoted below p. 52. 16</page><page sequence="9">that while, according to the Avesta, the haoma grows in the mountains, the Vedas know of two places where the soma is found, as a god in Heaven, as a plant in the mountains. The mountain where it grows best is called M?javant and therefore a name of Sorna is Maujavata; in AV. M?javant is the name of a people mentioned along with the Gandh?ris and the Balhikas, Macdonell and Keith, 1958 s.v. Perhaps the mountain has left its record in Chitr?l and nearby countries (e.g. Kati: Mrungul {gul = valley). Prof. Morgenstierne who has dedicated a very fine study to this subject is inclined to accept the theory of Mar? quart (Eran, p. 86, p. 137) who identifies Munjan (13b) with the country of the Sak? Haumavarg?. (Morgenstierne 1930-32, pp. 440, ff. and additional note 444). Also nowadays, timber collected in the mountains is thrown into the rivers, to let it drift down by the speedy running waters until it can be brought ashore in a bend of the river by experienced labourers and heaped up for sale. A good portion of it gets lost, because the logs may be stopped by the bends of the river, or by rocks or it may even be stolen. This method was followed in Sw?t up to a few years ago. When there were no roads, this was the cheapest and the only way for sending down to the trading centres of the valley the best qualities of all sorts of timber, for bartering it for goods not available in the secluded mountains; any bend of the K?bul river with ample and shallow waters {akte) would offer ideal conditions for heaping up the timber, letting it dry, have it ready for selling: it could be put to a variety of uses, in a market in which goods were bartered, and even ships built. I think that we can hardly dissociate Kaspapyros (or - tyros) from the Kaspioi mentio? ned by Herodotus (III 93) and from the Sacae though they were included in the fifteenth satrapy (Herodotus III, 93) located to the north-west and west of Bactria; in another place Herodotus (VII 66-67) refers to them after the Gandh?rians and Dadicae (14). (Cf. Mar? quart, Eran II, p. 140). All this leads to the probable conclusion that some Scythian tribes were pressing on Gandh?ra. Moreover all the hilly or mountainous ranges north of Gandh?ra and the neighbour? ing tracts were inhabited by people speaking different dialects, warlike, difficult to classify by a foreigner, who, from their being neither Iranians nor Indians, but speaking languages which possessed some elements similar to both, were generally named by strangers: Skythians. Before closing this paragraph it seems necessary to add that up to recent times we knew little about the peoples living between the Alingar or the Alishang and the K?e or the Sw?t, except that they were K?firs or Dards, divided into different tribes, secluded in their mountains. Much less do we know whether their tribes ever coalesced into a kind of confederacy, or a kingdom as the Dards of Baltistan later did (see below, p. 77). Which (13b) On a probable reference to M?javant in the Yasts see Burrow 1973 p. 138 n. 31. (14) In addition there are other Indians who border on the city of Kaspapyros and the country of Paktuike; these live to the north and in the direction of the north wind, as compared to the remaining Indians. 17</page><page sequence="10">were the original names of some of those tribes that took shelter in the seclusion of the Hindukush? As an example, I think it is of interest to resume briefly what Prof. Scar cia (1965, pp. XCII ff.) proposes about the name K?fir. He vocalizes the name found in the Arabic sources: Ktw, usually read Kator (= Chitr?l, according to some scholars) or "Katwar" {ktw in Baihaqi, B?bur etc.) and, with other authors, he locates them to the east of K?bul and to the north of Gal?l?b?d (Masson: Ketwer or Kata'war). Prof. Scarcia quotes Munshi Mohan L?l (1834) who says ? they confess to the Mull? to be K?fir? and adds that the Siy?h p?s call themselves K?fir without being ashamed. (Robertson 1896 reprint 1970, pp. 193 194). Robertson states that the Kafirs accept the name K?fir, but they are unable to pronoun? ce it. Biddulph registers the word Kappra saying that: it is a deformation of K?fir. But Prof. Scarcia asks himself why not argue that things may be the other way round? He assumes the preexistence in loco of a word phonetically similar to K?fir, which suggested the present denomination of these people. Thus Kappra (15) may well be traced back to an original Ktwr, Kat-pra, Kat-par (cf. Capperstan of Benedict Goes (Yule 1915-16 Cathay, II, 554, n. 2). A support to the theory of Prof. Scarcia may be found in Chinese, chieh = *Kiap (Karlgren 1923) Kap, a name given to K?firs inhabitants of some parts of Chitr?l as it has been shown by Prof. Enoki, with whom I completely agree, at p. 5 of his "remarks" published as Appendix II at the end of this article. To this suggestion I may add that perhaps P?nini might confirm the theory of Prof. Scarcia; in fact, who are those people whom he mentions along with the Dards: the Gab dikas (IV 3, 93) (15a), and of whom P?tanjali says that their abode was outside the ?ry?varta, that is, outside the Indian soil? ?ry?varta is so defined by R?jasekhara 1934, ch. XVII, p. 96 p?rv?parayoh samudrayor himavad-vindhy?yoi ca antaram ?ry?varta, ? the territory between the two oceans, the Western and the Eastern, and between the Him?laya and the Vindhyas is called ?ry?varta ?. What precedes seems to confirm the conclusion which may be drawn from the lists of Herodotus; i.e. that Sw?t was included among the Daradas (Daedalae of Curtius) and that soon after Alexander's expedition other ethnical situations had developed; in the Persian inscriptions, the Dards are not mentioned, because most probably they were mistaken as a peculiar branch of the Saka groups. 7. Gold Tributes and Gold Diggers The Hidus, Hindus are said to offer as tribute gold. They are located North of KaajtairuQoc, KacrjtdtuQog (cf. above, p. 16) and are certainly Dards, as has been already (15) On the probable relation between Kafirs and Caspioi see Marquart (Eran II, pp. 141 142). (15a) Quotations from P?nini imply references to Bh?sya and V?rttika commenting on them. 18</page><page sequence="11">anticipated by Marquart, {Eran 1905, p. 178). The traders in gold were people who could reach the middle and upper course of the Indus. There were near the Indus source, as there are even now, great mines of gold in the region of the Manasarovar and in Thokjalung (16); in ancient times that part of Western Tibet was probably a part of Zan Zun, the women kingdom, extending from south-west to north-east of Tibet (see Tucci 1956, pp. 92 ff.; Pelliot 1961, pp. 674 ff.); it corresponds to Suvarnabh?mi, Suvarnagotra, gser rigs, ? the golden family ? in the Chronicles of Ladakh. It was, no doubt, a long journey, if compared to that leading to the middle course of the Indus and to Kargil. Nor do we know the names of all the places along or near the Indus (1?) where the bartering or the selling of gold took place, though we may safely conclude that the trade was in the hands of the local tribes, mainly Dards. Certainly they did not push so far merely because that was the agreement with the Achaemenians but chiefly because such a trade, extremely valuable to them, had been going on since old times. When the sixth volume of the Imperial Gazetteer of India was published in 1908, Kargil, midway between Kashmir and Leh, was still said to be the centre of the gold trade. The Dards of the Kishangarig? and the Indus valleys were known to have been gold merchants since old times. Stein A. 1961, vol. II, p. 280, n. 5: for other references see ibid., p. 287 n.; but gold might have also come by trade from Western Tibet proper: the above mentioned Thokjalung and the zone near the Manasarovar, where I found some traces of gold digging, then forbidden by the Lhasa Authorities (Tucci 1937, p. 61, fig. facing p. 65). The mountains of the Daradas, to which Strabo and Ptolemaeus refer, and the plateau to the east of the mountains clearly point to the Indus valley and the deserts of the plateau of Ladakh. But other parts of the Pamirs cannot be excluded (Jett mar 1975, p. 1974); e.g. we know of Burushos traditions which mention the Golden Coun? try and the Golden Mountain, though, as rightly recognized by Prof. Jettmar, this may be a survival of Buddhist or Zan Zun folklore (18). As to gold being found in Sw?t there are valid testimonies in the records of the Chi? nese pilgrims: Hs?an-tsang writes that Sw?t produces gold. Sung Y?n describing the Buddhist settlement of T'o-lo (19) speaks of six thousand gold (gilt) images (some editions write 60.000!). Also in the protohistoric tombs excavated in Sw?t gold earrings have occasionally been found. It is true that Herodotus tells us how such gold was procured by the Indians: ? To the east of them there is a large desert, and in this desert live some big ants not so big as (16) As regards the Himalayan gold cf. Ha taka, of the traditional Indian geography from Mah?bh?rata to R?m?yana, Levi 1918, p. 79. (17) In the itinerary in Khotanese Saka (pub? lished by Bailey 1936, p. 258) from Gilgit to Chilas and Kashmir (written between 958-972) the Indus is called: Ysarniji ttap cthe Golden river5 which is here certainly not a mere poetical attribute. (18) According to B. Ansari Encyclop. Islamica s.v. Dardist?n, Hunza and Nagar, used to send to the Mah?r?ja of Kashmir handfuls of gold dust. (19) To lo, d'a l?; Mm. da, dra, da, dha, dha; - ra, la. 19</page><page sequence="12">dogs, but bigger than foxes. These ants make their dwellings underground, digging out the sand ... It is after this sand that the Indians set forth into the desert ... When the Indians come to the place with their sacks, they fill these with the same and ride away back with all speed; for ... the ants forthwith scent them out and give chase, being, it would seem, so much swifter than all other creatures, that if the Indians made not haste on their way while the ants are mustering, not one of them would escape ?. (Transl. A. D. Godley). We may add to what we have said a quotation from Strabo XV, I, 44, who connects the story of the gold digging ants with the AepSai, the Darada, Dards, an Indian tribe living "in the mountains", to the east, where is a large plateau; the gold miners are there; the digging takes place in winter. Ptolemaeus locates the Dards below the Indus adding that their mountains raise right above them. Lastly, Plinius, Nat. Hist., VI 67 writes that the Dards produce gold (20) and the Setae also silver. Prof. Eggermont interprets Setae as Soua stene; this is possible, but needs confirmation. We are here confronted with a well-known tale, that of the gold-digging ants (Laufer, 1898, p. 429 ff.). The Indians too are aware of the same story, but for them, the gold (20a) is chiefly a trade of the Khasi or Kh?sa (on whom see Tucci 1956, pp. 92 ff. and here below, cf. Pelliot 1963, p. 671 ff.); they were a people living in Chilas, or nearby and N. W. of Kashmir. Later, spreading eastwards, they conquered Western Tibet and Western Nepal. This tale can also be found in China, Tibet and Mongolia. A living tradition has also been collected by A. H. Francke in Kalatze, a village in which Dard was still spoken by some of its inhabitants in 1927 when I was there (Hermann 1939, pp. 10 ff.). Therefore, I do not think that the desert of Tharu has something to do with this tale. Herodotus was told the story by the Iranians, but neither he nor his informants had a clear notion about the exact situation of the eastermost boundaries of the Achaemenian Empire. The Dards spread in early times not only in Chitr?l, Sw?t, K?hist?n, Gilgit and Dardist?n but also up to Ladakh, as will be shown below. The Indians, Hidus of the inscriptions of Persepolis, are said to bring as a tribute gold bags, i.e. gold dust (Herodotus, III 98 and 192 ff.). I quite agree with Dr. Walser (1966, pi. 25, 71-73, 86, pp. 94 ff.) that those containers do represent vases rather than bags; their content was pure gold; the Achaemenians wanted metal ready for being worked; I think that the representations of Persepolis are here more realistic than the narrative of Herodotus, III 98, 102 ff. The offering of the donkey, a majestic donkey (or an onager?) is quite peculiar, not a common one. Donkeys were not unknown in India, they were cer? tainly there before the introduction of the horse.

Inhumation and Cremation In Sw?t, concerning the disposal of the dead, there coexist different types of burials: inhumation in bent position, combustion, secondary burials etc., combusted or non-combu? sted bones contained in big jars with a cover etc. in small rectangular urns (for a detai? led treatment of this problem, cf. Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972 and the biblio? graphy quoted in that volume) (21). The big jars and sometimes the urns often show two holes indicating the two eyes and a protuberance meant to suggest the reproduction of a nose. I think that if no other elements are available it is hazardous to draw any chronological conclusion from the dif? ferent types of burials. It is attested that inhumation was not unknown in Vedic India {AV 5, 30, 14): M? nu bh?migrho bhuv?t, ? may not be reserved for one an earthen house ?; in RV. the ex? pression: anagnidagdh?h, ? those who have not been burnt by fire ? hints at burial or exposure. So also RV., VII 39, 1 ? May I not go to the earthen house ?; of course even now there are exceptions to cremation (today incineration); such is the case, among other ones, of ascetics or of babies. More evident is the reference in AV., XVIII 2, 34 (transl. Whitney, revised and edited by Lanman, H.O.S. p. 840, XVIII 2, 34): ? They that are buried and they that are scattered away (22), and they that are set up (uddhit?h) all those Fathers, O Agni, bring thou down to eat oblation ?; p. 836, XVIII 2-19: ? be pleasant to him, o earth, a thornless resting place, grant him broad refuge ?; p. 837, XVIII 2-20: ? In the unoppressive wide space of earth be thou deposited ?; p. 838, XVIII 2, 25: ? Let not the tree oppress thee ?; p. 843, XVIII 2, 52: ?I cover thee excellently with the gar? ment of mother earth ?. It would be easy to extend the exemplification. Some scholars, as Kane (1941, p. 232), intend uddhita as ? deposited above ?; but he adds also ? on trees or in caves ?. I think that ? deposited in a high place ? is to be preferred to ? deposited above ?, though we know of some tribes, like the Licchavis, who used to suspend the dead also on trees (See Law 1943, p. 302). Nor was the custom unknown of depositing cremated bones in some urns, which were subsequently buried (for references, Kane 1941, pp. 232 ff.). This practice is still followed in some cases, when the relatives bring back home the ashes in an urn, and lay them down in the earth (23). (2i) In these volumes and in the many articles published by Prof. Stacul the problem of the various systems of burial are carefully examined. I want only to propose some comparisons with other peoples of the Hindukush and the Pamirs and to investigate some possible reasons of the second burial and of the cremation. (22) d?radese kasthavat parityakt?h. (23) Keith 1925, p. 418 asserts, perhaps unduly exaggerating, that the Vedas do not make 21</page><page sequence="14">On the contrary, in the Upanishadic literature, inhumation appears as a disposal of the dead condemned being a practice peculiar to the Asura {Ch?ndogya Upanisad, VII 8, 5: ? Therefore, even here they say one who is not a giver, who has no faith, who does not offer sacrifices, that he is a demon [Asura], for this is the doctrine of the demons [Asura]. They adore the body of the deceased with what they have begged, with the clothes and orna? ments, and think that thereby they will win the yonder world ? (Radhakrishnan, p. 504). Thus, all this shows that ancient Indian sources point to the contemporaneity of the different ways of disposing of the dead. 9. Secondary Inhumation Many tombs have been certainly opened, after a corpse had already been laid there, for placing another body in the same grave, near him; sometimes, the bones of the former burials were heaped in a corner, in which case no trace of the precedent grave furniture is left. I am taking into consideration only the tombs that have not been damaged, as it occurs when, at a later time, another grave was cut into the former. There might have been a sema on top of each tomb to facilitate the location of the family tomb (see Robertson 1896, fig. facing p. 648); the semata might have been in wood or in stone (two of them, in stone with rough designs, have been found near Loe banr) (24). Relating the story of Nysa, Arrianus writes that when the encampment of the Macedonians was set up near the graveyard of those people, a great fire developed in the latter; this suggests that the tombs of Nysa, as I already anticipated (Tucci 1963, p. 157) had wooden structures on them, of which the tombs of Chitr?l with images of men and horse? men may still be an example. Some Islamic tombs of upper Swat showing the stylised head of a horse at the upper end and the wooden enclosures of such tombs finely decora? ted, can be considered as a survival, which Islam has not been able to cancel. But there are also tombs with no trace of having been used, that is to say, with no hint of a previous burial. The double burial, when a skeleton is disposed of anatomi? cally, and the heap of bones of another corpse is found in a corner, without any grave furniture, presents many problems. It seems to indicate not only the probable existence of a family grave, it may lead to suppose also the practice of a well-known custom, that of exposing a corpse until the flesh is completely consumed, and then the bones are collected and laid in the family grave. The existence of family graves and the accumulation of rough coffins in which the any difference between burning and burying. The body was washed and anointed, before burial or combustion. (24) Loebanr "great forest5 is the survival, in Pashtu, of the name of the Mah?vana "great forest'; probably it started at the head of the J?mbil and extended to the mountains bordering the Y?sufzai territory up to Buner (cf. Levi, 1915 Mm. p. 72). 22</page><page sequence="15">dead had been enclosed, so badly made that they can crash down and let the corpses fall to the ground, is attested among some tribes of K?firistan (Robertson 1896, p. 641: ? Several bodies are put in the same receptacle ?; Biddulph 1893, p. 14; Jettmar 1975. A good photo of crumbled and crashed coffins in Sch?mberg 1938, facing p. 42). The same is repeated by Snoy 1962 (?Man kann annehmen, dass es Familien-Bestattungen waren ?, p. 189). 10. Other Burials On this subject of multiple burials in Sw?t, I have already referred to Silvi Anto nini-Stacul and to the articles of Prof. Stacul; neverthless it is not out of place to add here a short report of Prof. Maurizio Taddei, which he very kindly sent me, on a trial trench dug by him in Butkar? IIb, below the necropolis of Butkara II. ? In the course of the excavation campaign of 1963, conducted by the Italian Ar? chaeological Mission in Sw?t, I had the opportunity of throwing light on some schist fune? rary structures, in the area of Butkara II, that proved at once to lack homogeneity with the tombs of the necropolis of the same site, published by Silvi and Stacul. ? The structures in question lie downstream of the necropolis, along the mule-track that skirts the left bank of the river J?mbil. From a stratigraphic point of view, they proved to be of later date than other structures, of an entirely different character with respect to their function, which, on the basis of the masonry technique, I was led to attribute to a well-established Gandharan epoch (Kus?na?); therefore they appear to be contemporary with or later than the Buddhist sacred area that, on the slopes of the hill, is superimposed in its turn to the necropolis published by Silvi and Stacul. ? We have to deal with three tombs, that I marked at the time with numbers 49, 50 and 51. Of these, tombs 49 and 50 belong to earlier times, while tomb 50 is clearly later inserted between the two preceding ones, making use of one side of the outer ma? sonry of tomb 51 as if it were a wall of its own. Tomb 49 is severely damaged, and I therefore restrict myself to report on the main features of tombs 50 and 51. ? Tomb 51. At the outside, it is clearly divided into two parts, the lower one larger, so as to give place to a large offset: however, I have been unable to ascertain whether this was an offset connected with the foundation, or whether both structures were on view, as the analogy of the masonry technique would lead us to suppose. There is no doubt, anyhow, that the upper structure was above ground level. ? In the interior, two superimposed chambers have been found, their division being marked by an offset corresponding to the one on the outside. In the upper chamber a skeleton was laid, in anatomical connection, together with scattered bones belonging to other skeletons (including two skulls). The lower chamber, overlaid with a slab of schist resting on the offset, contained an ossuary proper. ? Tomb 50. This tomb consisted of an only chamber, whose floor corresponded to the level of the exterior offset of tomb 51. It contained a skeleton in anatomic connec 23</page><page sequence="16">tion (excepting the skull, found at the level of the pelvis), and bones belonging to other ske? letons (among which fragments of skulls), heaped up at the feet of the first one. ? No funerary furniture was found in any of the tombs ?. Of course the absence of any funeral furniture seems to exclude a family burial, though the presence, in the upper chamber, of one skeleton with fragments of other ones, might indicate (with little probability) that the chamber was reserved for a further burial of another eventual dead. The lower chamber being full, they deposited the last skeleton on the upper part of the tomb. Certainly the case is not so simple. We notice that tomb 51, a monumental grave, is divided into two parts; a lower one which is a mere ossuary; in the upper one we find only one skeleton, scattered fragments of other skeletons and two skulls. Tomb 50 contains one skeleton with the skull placed at the level of the pelvis; other bones have been heaped at the feet of the skeleton itself, along with fragments of skulls. It seems to me that we have here the example of a hurried up ceremony in the course of which bones have been collected without caring to ascertain to whom the skeletal remains belonged. Skeletons have been unceremoniously collected and buried in a well-built ossuary; in the upper cham? ber there is a skeleton with fragments of other skulls which seems to imply that the decea? sed was laid there for his last definite rest along with casual fragments of unqualified re? mains. But it is also possible to argue that an entire family or clan had formerly buried its dead in its own graveyard (on the possibility of the existence of clan graveyards see be? low, p. 32) in Butkara; when the land passed into other hands, for instance to a new landlord or to a monastic Buddhist settlement for building a st?pa or a sangh?r?ma (as in fact happened), since it was not propitious to erect a sacred edifice on a place con? taminated by death, the clan emptied its old graves and built a receptacle for the remains of its ancestors; the upper place might have been reserved for the most recently deceased of the family whose memory was still alive, or of the supposed ancestor around whose tomb the cemetery had slowly developed. Something of this kind happens among the Khasis in Assam. They cremate the bodies, collect the bones in a square cist, to be placed somewhere near the house, and after an in? determinate time, they remove those cists to the family's graveyard. Only the number of the dead is recollected and only the name of the oldest ancestor is recorded. They then heap stones on them (Roy 1963, pp. 520 ff.). That the complete disposal of the dead and the definite laying out of a tomb could take place at any time, after burial, is shown also by some practices of the Kafirs. Among them the wooden image of the deceased is ? not erected till a year after his death ? (Sch?m? berg 1938, p. 51). In one of his articles Prof. Stacul (1975, p. 323) advances various hypotheses; some of them certain, others possible. One may also suppose that the upper chamber, i.e. the empty space in the middle of which the real grave is dug, might have been used for the consumption of the flesh, and that, when this was over, the bones were disposed in the grave itself. It is not to be excluded that some of the graves containing more than two 24</page><page sequence="17">skeletons, might be open at no fixed date collectively on some special occasions (Stacul 1975, p. 375) as it is practised among the Khasis ? (See above, p. 24) (25). The flesh of a corpse in decomposition is a pollution, while bones are the essential part of an individual. Among the Tibetans rus means, at the same time, bone and clan. That was perhaps the reason why the corpses of the Tibetan kings were closed in an iso? lated room and left there one year or even longer after death, before being laid in their tomb. 11. Decomposed Flesh is Pollution Also in Mah?y?na Buddhism, in certain rituals meant to eliminate the evil karma of the dead, and introduced in the liturgy of the Kun rig cycle (Vairocana) (in Tibet, perhaps with no Indian prototypes) the dead is represented by a fragment of his bones {rus = bone, family) or by a piece of paper or wood, on which his name has been written (Tuc ci 1970, p. 218). We may recall the bones deposited in vases in Baluchistan, perhaps after having cut off the flesh. Bones painted with ochre have been found in Kashmir at Burzahom (Gupta 1972, pp. 82 ff.). The main idea was that of burying bones without flesh: it is the background of a vast Indian literature in which the decomposition of our body is described with an almost morbid obstinacy, in order to induce in the mind of the reader a deep contemptus mundi (e.g. some pages of the Bodhic?ry?vat?ra of S?ntideva). In Sw?t so far there is no trace of incineration, but only of combustion. The bodies of s?dhus as well of criminals were exposed in lonely places, frequented by yogins for meditation; according to Buddhist tradition the most famous cemeteries {?mas? na) (26) were eight; Uddiy?na itself was famous for its eight graveyards. The Tibetan followers of the gCod school use to retire in cemeteries for their spi? ritual exercises. The Mah?parinibb?nasutta shows that the funeral rites followed for the Buddha, on which scholars have discussed so much, were meant chiefly for the destruc? tion of the flesh. According to tradition, the Mallas of Kusin?ra (Kusinagara) wrapped the body of the (25) On the collective burials still practised in Dardistan, see Jettmar 1967, pp. 63-88. (26) In Indo-Tibetica III, ii, pp. 174 ff. I have published two small treatises of the astasmas?na; they are situated in the four quarters and the intermediate space: each one of them has a particular tree, the god corresponding to the point of the space, where he is located and the vehicle of the same god, a snake (n?ga)y a cloud, a st?pa, a mountain. In a book attributed to Narop? Yul ni su rtsa bat ryu mts'an, bTan agyur, slsfags section, U rgyan is situated in the west and it is a place blessed by the mkV gro ma (d?kini). In the dPal U rgyan gyi mal abyor mat rah gi Ions spyod kyi rtog pa of Bir ba pa (sftags section), the eight smas?nas in Uddiy?na itself are enumerated. 25</page><page sequence="18">Buddha in many sheets of cotton, and placed it in an iron pot, of the kind that are used for storing oil; then they covered it with another vase of the same kind, and placed the pot on the fire. In this way, burning the body, ? what was skin or integument or flesh or nerves or humours of the junctures, of all these no ashes nor dust of ashes were seen, but only the bones remained. Just as when butter or oil are burnt, no ashes nor dust of ashes can be seen, so of the body of the Buddha there were neither ashes nor dust of ashes ? (DN XVI, VI 23, Rhys Davids, 1910). Such a belief and the resulting rites may help us in solving the problem of some tombs of Swat. They are empty, except for a few very small fragments of small bones; these apparently show that a corpse had been laid in the grave for a certain period, and then taken off. I therefore accept the solution proposed by Prof. Stacul; the body was kept there until its full consumption was over, then the bones were collected and buried in another empty grave kept ready for that purpose or placed in an urn. It was, as we have seen, the practice followed by the Tibetan kings and other peoples. Such a rite may explain the peculiarity of some other tombs in which the body is not found in its usual bent position: instead of that, there is a heap of bones on which the skull has been laid (27). I must add that almost all the cemeteries discovered are near rivers or streamlets; this fact is certainly not a mere coincidence, but it indicates that the washing of the body was an essential part of the ceremonial as it has frequently been; in India too the body was washed and anointed (Keith 1925, p. 418). Ill Religion 12. Mountain Worship Can we say anything about the religion of those ancient Sw?tis of whom, so far, only the graveyards and a few habitations have been found? Very little indeed, and this also cannot but be largely hypothetical. If what is narrated about Nysa has some truth in it, and we keep in mind that the Ham and the Tiric-mir have been or still are sacred for some conglomerations of tribes, we may suppose that, when the immigrants settled down in a territory, they chose some mountain as a sacred centre of the community; we are there (27) Bone stripping of flesh with a knife is testified by the Proto-Scythian Timber-Grave Cul ture: Merpert 1942, pp. 56, 41. 26</page><page sequence="19">fore confronted with some primeval cosmological ideas, a common belief of the Proto-Indo Aryans, which later were better codified especially in India (perhaps also under the impact of Near Eastern conceptions); the mountain patron of the tribe, the seat of the ancestor, the place upon which the ancestor or a patron god had descended became the centre of the Universe, the Meru of Indian cosmology. The Meru is often identified, after the expansion of Hinduism, with the Kail?sa; it is an idea which from India spread over many parts of Asia, where the Meru and the Kail?sa emerged, with the diffusion of Buddhism and Shaivism in a not rare collusion with local traditions (28). The Mongols, the Buriats, the Kalmucks call the World-mountain, the centre of the Universe: Sumbur, Sumur, which is nothing else but Sumeru, Meru (U. Harva 1938, pp. 59 ff.). Temples are also called Meru or Kail?sa, the famous moun? tain of Western Tibet near the sacred lake Manasarovar. There is a multiplication of these Holy Mountains. Besides the Kail?sa in Western Tibet, we have also an Indian Kail?sa to the west of Qni in the Sutlej Valley also called Kanaur (Kinnaur) Kail?sa, (Tucci 1971, p. 548; Kullar 1972, p. 105) and a Chamba Kail?sa {ibid., fig. 30). Another Kail?s Range lies north-east of Gilgit, south of Hunza, east of Punyal, the highest peak being the Dumani or Rakaposh, 25, 550 feet high. The Meros of the Nysaei has been identified by G. Morgenstierne with the Tiric Mir in Chitr?l; all survivals of an ancient cosmological Indo-Aryan intuition, which each people transferred in the highest part of the place where it settled (Morgenstierne 1930-32, p. 443). On the Mountain Munjavat, see above p. 17. The Meru of Sw?t was the Ham (Chinese I-lo, Tibetan Hilo). This explains why the graveyards are generally dug on the slopes of hills and looking towards higher mountains: this reminds me of what happened in Tibet (29) where almost each tribe worshipped its own mountain because it was the place where the ancestor or the forefather himself of the tribes was supposed to have descended from heaven to earth, it also was the place of sacrifices and seasonal cults. In another article dealing with Siva mountain in Gandh?ra (Tucci 1963, p. 159) I dealt with the same subject and indi? cated that as Siva is called G?ndh?ra, the goddess is G?ndh?ri. This cult of the mountains, or cosmic mountain or the mountain as a God or a Goddess, is still alive among the K?firs: e.g. the goddess Kime (Kushumai) rose from a lake. According to others she ap? peared in the mountain Tiric-Mir. Goats are sacrificed to her (Snoy 1962, p. 84) (30). The Peris in Chitr?l have their castle on top of mountains (Jettmar 1975, p. 442 and pas? sim). The same cult can be found among the Shinas.

It was sacred to Bhlm?devi, as we are told by Foucher 1942, p. 303. She was considered to be very powerful and Mahesvara (Siva) had a temple below the mountain itself; in the temple there were many s?dbus who used to besmear with ashes their bodies. The image of the goddess of which no description is given was self-made svayambh? (Tib. ran abyun); it was perhaps formless, but the centre of great attraction. The informer of Foucher told him a very interesting story. Some ene? mies of a fakir had thrown him from the top of the rock down into the abyss; but he re? mained suspended in the void taking hold of the branches of a tree, until a woman fakir let him fall down into a basket she carried. This fairy was Sher-b?nu the "lion-woman"; which name corresponds to Simhav?hini, an epithet of Durg?. We have here four themes; the cult of the mountain, the cult of its goddess or fairy aniconically represented, the assi? milation of an aboriginal devi to the mountain and to Durg?, the survival of the same cult under Islam. The introduction of Hindu Gods in the Buddhist mandalas of Vajray?na is a well known fact. See the indices to Tucci 1941: Indra, Indr?nl, Um?, GaurT, Camund?, Mah? laksml, etc. Another holy mountain of Sw?t, which I cannot identify, was Murundaka, hard to ascend and famous because it was the theatre of a magical contestation between Kambala and Kukkurip? (Tucci 1958, p. 324) (31). 13. Lakes According to Sung Y?n, in Sw?t, west of the river, there lies a lake which is the seat of a n?gar?ja; near the lake there is also a temple. When the N?gar?ja performs a mi? racle, the king throws into the lake gold and other precious things and stones; when these precious things come out of the lake, they are taken over, at the request of the king, by the monks; the monks of the temple are supported by such resources as are provided by the lake. Among the Ashkun K?firs there are some tanks full of precious things which nobody can get hold of, because they are protected by fairies (Snoy 1962, p. 84). In the K?fir traditions there are some magic lakes which may cause great floods: hence the custom of throwing an iron arrow into them; this story reminds us of the floods caused by Apal?la in (31) On the Murimdas as a people see Egger mont 1966. Murunda was the name of the Saka chiefs. Cf. Levi 1935; Konow 1929, p. XXI; L?ders 1961. According to some legends told by the local people Gullisar 9477 feet facing Loebanr is said to have been a holy mountain. 28</page><page sequence="21">Sw?t though, I agree, the two stories seem to have no close connection as regards the details, but imply the demoniac or divine character of the lakes. Mention of other sacred lakes is found also in Uddiy?na, the most celebrated one being that from which, on a lotus, was born Padmasambhava the lake was called Dhanakosa. It may be one of the lakes in the basin of the Daral river in K?hist?n. 14. The Horse Many of the tribes that Alexander had to pass through bear names derived from that of the horse; such a toponymy reminds us of the peculiar devotion of the Scythians for the horse; hence the tribal names of many tribes: Aspasioi, Assaka, Assakenoi etc. hence also the skeletons of two horses discovered near the tombs in K?telai (32), hence too the handle of the cover of a funerary urn from Loebanr (Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972, pi. XIX, 1). Nor should the horse figurines found in K?telai be forgotten {ibid., pi. LIII a). It is not completely out of place to mention the bronze cauldron with handles and a projection representing a horse head found in Gilgit (Stein 1944, pp. 15-16). Among the Prasun the horse of Imra is of gold (but also the demon is a horse of iron) and it is the horse who lets the Sun free: a horse is sacrificed in Kushteki near the temple of Imra (Snoy 1962, p. 128 (33). Also among other peoples the horse is connected with sun worship (See Koppers 1936, pp. 282 ff., 311. In addition, it possesses a ? herrenkultur liche oder aristokratische Note, welches Pferde kult und in besonderen dem Pferdeopfer eigen? t?mlich zu sein scheint ?). Horses were killed during the funerary ceremonies also in Tibet: Tucci 1949, pp. 716-17; Stein 1962, pp. 485 ff.; Pelliot 1961, p. 9. Also the Massagetae worshiped the horse Strabo, XI, 8, 6. ? The Massagetae regard Helius alone as god and to him they sacrifice horses, and they consider the best kind of death when they are old to be chopped up with the flesh of cattle and eaten mixed up with that flesh. But those who died of disease are cast out as impious and worthy only to be eaten by wild beasts ?. 15. Fertility Goddesses The figures which have been found in the graves cannot be classified as totems, as Dani seems inclined to think. I suppose that they should be considered as varieties of lo (32) Others have been found in the excavations of Aligr?ma (kind information supplied by Dr S. Tusa). (33) Besides Snoy, see Robertson 1896 (see now Jettmar 1975) on the legends on the horse and its worship. Indices s.v. 29</page><page sequence="22">cal goddesses or hypostases of the so-called Magna Mater, or more simply goddesses of fertility. I think that it will be useful to add here the detailed description contained in the book by Silvi-Antonini and Stacul 1972 (p. 36): Type FTl ? Anthropomorphic female figurine with high diadem (?) above the head; face charac? terized by protruding nose; rhomboid bust and breast achieved by hemispherical relief-work; lower limbs consisting of two conical or cylindrical appendices (pi. XLVII a, b, c and d; colour plate; pi. XLVIII a and b; pi. XLIX a and b; pi. L a, b, c and d; colour plate). Variant: FT1I anthropomor? phic male figurine (pi. XLVIII c and d). Type FT2 ? Anthropomorphic female figurine with flat body and protruding nose; breast achieved by hemispherical relief-work; arms consisting of curved lateral projections and lower limbs joined together outlined by semicircular profile (pi. LI c). Variant: FT2I with eyes marked by small holes and with lower limbs outlined by triangular profile (pi. LI a and b). Type FT3 ? Anthropomorphic female figurine with high diadem (?) above the head; face charac? terized by protruding nose and breast achieved by hemispherical relief-work; arms consisting of small curved lateral projections and lower limbs joined together outlined by rectangular profile (pi. LI d). Type FB4 ? Small anthropomorphic figurine with flat body; head just outlined by circular profile and eyes indicated by single transverse hole; arms and limbs carved on both sides (pi. LII a). Type FB5 ? Small anthropomorphic figurine with long neck and head just outlined by triangular profile; eyes indicated by single transverse hole; limbs carved on both sides (pi. LII b). Thus these female images are bidimensional; they represent some imprecise pre? sences which should anyhow be propitiated, because their anger may be dangerous to man (for their survivals see Jettmar 1975, p. 219). The dots on the two sides of the head are probably earrings with a central large plaquette surrounded by smaller stones (cornelian?); in some cases the hair descends on the back (Silvi and Sta? cul 1972, pi. XLVII) in parallel lines; as it is still found occasionally among the Kafirs and among Tibetan women (Western Tibet). What is rather surprising is the scarcity of a relevant indication of the sex, though one statuette, here not reproduced, has the pubic region marked by a large rosette as an ornament to cover it (or the pubic hair?). The presiding deity of Puskal?vati (34) was Amb?, Ambi; G?ndh?ri was the most popular god? dess of Gandh?ra, as we easily infer from the name itself; one may quote a great number of similar other local goddesses in Gandh?ra, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, of which mention is made in Sanskrit literature (see Tucci 1963). Thus, from later Indian texts preserving old popular traditions we may conclude that also in those regions the cult of such female deities was widely spread; they survive now among the K?firs, the Shinas, Chitralis where their connection with the mountains is very strict, they become the dakinis of Vaj ray?na, and are still alive, with different forms and names, Peri, Rui, R?i, etc. The breast is represented, though in general it is not very prominent. Hips are some? times very large so that some of these images assume the form of a violin, or a flat repre? sentation of a steatopygic female. (34) On the coins of Puskal?vatl, Pukhal?vadi the names found are AmbI, Ambik?, Amb?. But Puskar?vati was also the name of a river (K?sik?, on IV, 2, 8, VI, 1, 219; VI, 3, 119). 30</page><page sequence="23">16. Sun Worship The object described as pendant type (Silvi and Stacul vol. I, p. 44, fig. 27e) may be a symbol of the sun, as divided on its surface by crossed lines into four quarters. The same solar symbol is visible in some petroglyphs found by the Alpine expedition of Mr Bergamaschi on some rocks in the valley of Barpu on the way to Hunza. The carving has been made by poking on an isolated rock in the middle of the valley itself. The figures of ibexes are predominating. The petroglyph which I take as the symbol of sun cannot be a shield because no image of men is visible near it. These engravings are therefore completely different from those discovered in G?gda ra where the ibex is absent. Also in some rituals of the Br?hmanas the sun is represented by a golden disk: (Sata patha-Br?hmana, VII 4, 1, 10) ?He, then, puts the gold plate [which the sacrificer wears round his neck during the ceremony: VI 7, 1, 1 ff.] thereon. Now this gold plate is yonder sun for he shines over all the creatures here on earth ?. And again, XII 4, 4, 6: ? verily oh those rays (of the sun) are the All-gods (visve dev?h) ?, S?rya in RV, I 115, 1; VI 51; X 37, 1) is called the Eye of Mitra, Varuna and Agni (34a). Another object which is of religious significance is an arrow in bronze found in our excavations and reproduced in Dani 1967, pi. Lb, fig. la (now in the Museum of Saidu Sharif); Jettmar 1967 describes it as a laurel leaf with three ribs, and compares it with some ribbed daggers found by the Russian archaeologists as productions of Ural metallur? gists. (See for other examples Litvinskij 1972, p. 70). It is certainly a ritual or sacral thing, not a functional arrow: the arrow is a symbol of the sky or of the lightening, preg? nant of so many archetypes in different religions (see Jettmar 1975, Indices s.v. ? Pfeil ?; Eliade 1970, pp. 59-60). Two skeletons, one of a man and the other of a young woman lovingly embraced have been found in one tomb. It is impossible to argue that this rite is an anticipation of an (unburned) sail of the Hindus, or that the couple died at the same time, or that the fact of their facing one another embraced suggests a self-immolation. But we must consider that such a disposal of two skeletons of a man and a woman lovingly embraced, is docu? mented likewise in some tombs of Turkestan, and also in one discovered in Shahr-i Sokhta in eastern Iran, Grave 112 (see Piperno and Tosi 1975, p. 186). Two skeletons that, though not embracing each other but lying side by side very closely, are reproduced in fig. 5 of Uspehi sredneaziatskoj arheologii, Leningrad, 1975 (34b). Thus, we may tentatively surmise that there might have existed occasional practices of immolation of some girls (the one of Shahr-i (34a) It may be interesting to quote here what we read in the Hud?d-al-'?lam (1937, p. 121) that the kings of Bolor claimed to be the descend? ants of the Sun. (34b) in the Dahginai song (Morgenstierne IIFL. (2nd ed.) vol. IV p. 51), a young man in love with a girl, when she died, committed suicide ? lying face downwards on the body of the dead girl. After many attempts to separate the bodies unsuccessfully they were finally left in the same position ?. 31</page><page sequence="24">Sokhta seems to be about twenty years old); the tomb of Sw?t is now in the Museum of Saidu Sh?rif, but no anthropological examination has been made possible so far (35). 17. The Slabs Covering the Tombs Another fact is worth noting; the general structural scheme of the grave has been described by Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972. It is useless to repeat here what they have diligently written; but one fact should be mentioned. The real grave, meant to con? tain the corpse or the skeleton, is in most cases covered by three slabs of stone (35a). The usual presence of the three slabs of stone cannot be casual. It has certainly a cultual implica? tion which now appears evident after the "triadic mode of thinking" has so well been elu? cidated by Prof. Gonda. This fact establishes a link with the people of which the tombs have been dug, and the tripartite intuition which dominated the mental and cultual vision of life homologous to the Vedic one (see above, p. 13). Meanwhile Dr S. Salvatori has published in EW, 1975, pp. 333 ff. an interesting study ? Analysis of the Association of Types in Protohistoric Graveyards of the Sw?t Val? ley ? in which he has proven, successfully to my mind, that the graves of Period I (= P.V. of Stacul) at K?telai ? are concentrated in the central-eastern area of the burial ground ?. The graves of P. II (? VI Stacul) show ? that besides the areas used in P. I the southwestern part also begins to be used, with an extension of the area of the grave? yard, or with a change in the area of concentration ? (p. 351). From this examination of the burial situation some facts may be evinced; the circular arrangement of the graves, or of some groups of them, ? or the particular concentration of graves in a single period ?. This may lead us to think ? of a link between certain areas and family or interfamily groups ?. This seems to reinforce some of my ideas which I will expound in the section on the tribal system practised in that region. 18. Drinks The people to whom the tombs belong used to drink and perhaps, implicitly, to offer libations during the funeral ceremonies. So it appears from the "brandy bowls" and other drinking vessels found in the tombs (and also in the houses so far excavated). Some of these vases have been brought to Italy for the examination of their contents. (35) The sa? practices (recorded by some trav? ellers - Biddulph, Drew, etc.) have disappeared after Islamization, but the tradition of it survived among the Shinas when Dainelli was there (Bia sutti and Dainelli 1925, vol. IX, p. 80). It cannot be excluded a priori that the sati sacrifice had been approved by some Dardic tribes converted to Hinduism, on account of even rare survivals of an ancient immolation of the wife in the tomb of the husband. Naturally, this is a mere hypothesis which should be further inves? tigated. (Chiefly undertaking excavations in Bal tistan). (35a) ? There are usually three of these schist slabs ?. Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972 p. 11. 32</page><page sequence="25">But from the flotation of the earth in the habitat of Aligr?ma the presence of seeds of grapes is documented. This is confirmed by the story of Nysa which shows that its inhabitants used to drink wine or other intoxicating liquors probably extracted from rhu? barb haoma-zairi-gaono of the Avesta, the sotnaoi the Vedas; we know that the Kafirs, untouch? ed by Islam, are still very found of drinking it (see A. Stein 1928-30, pp. 501 ff.; Mor genstierne 1950-53, p. 34) (36). In the year 1969 Mr. Gordon Wasson, Honorary Research Fellow of the Botanical Museum, Harvard University, published a book on ?Sorna divine mushroom ? (Wasson 1969), in which he asserted that soma is a red mushroom with white spots common in the birch and pine forest of Eurasia; its botanical name is amanita muscaria. His views were not generally accepted; the criticism was advanced by Prof. Brough in BSOAS, XXXIV, Part 2, pp. 331, 362 and F.B.J. Kuiper in his review of Mr. Wasson's book in Indo-Iranian Journal, XII 4, 1970, p. 784. Mr. Wasson published a rejoinder to Prof. Brough, ? Sorna and the Fly agaric ?, in 1972, Botanical Museum Harvard University, Cam? bridge, Mass. The question is still unsolved: that soma was intoxicating is certain; more probably exhilarating and hallucinogenous (36a). The problem concerning the drinks of the old tribes of Swat may be solved by paleo botanists by the flotation of the earth of early habitations. I can add that in the Tantric schools the first of the five makaras (words beginning with the letter ma) is mudr?, one of the ancient necessary elements of every esoteric ceremony; alcohol is enlisted separately in the five makaras. The original meaning of mudr? seems to be that of an hallucinogenous plant. The preparation of the exhilarating drinks used in some tan? tric ceremonies is represented on some sculptures (Khajur?ho). But I cannot find the botanical name of the mudr?. Buddhism also seems to have been compelled to allow, in those countries, some exceptions to its prescriptions concerning the prohibition of drinking alcoholic beverages (as was the case also in Tibet, Nepal and China). The Indian names for grape show that some qualities of grapes were introduced from the North: gostani from Gost?na, Khotan; harahaur?, another name for dr?ks? from the name of the Harahaurak? (Levi 1965, p. 260); Brhatsamhit? (with Comm. of Utpala, XIV 33): Siddhasauviro r?j? ca H?rahauro Madresas c?nyas' ca Kaunindah (37). (36) Cf. Jettmar, 1975, p. 90. (36a) The identification of haoma, soma with the rhubarb, the yellow golden plant (zairi gaono) endowed with strengthening hallu? cinating power proposed by Stein (On the ephedra, the Hum plant and the soma, BSOS, VI, p. 501 f.) is accepted also by Morgenstierne, 1973 p. 276, who adds that an identification of Soma with Amanita muscaria would not exclude the local substitution of rhubarb. The opinion of R. Gordon Wasson received the support of Prof. Gershevitch 1974 p. 45-78 (see also Fussman 1977 p. 41 f.). (37) Sanskr. dr?ks? is postvedic, the Vedic sv?tr?: RV, X 46, 7 sv?tr?bh?j? vayas? "with strengthening food"; sv?tr? (Monier Williams: "strengthening, invigorating" may refer to soma, rhubarb, for which later also grapes were sub? stituted. See discussion by Morgenstierne 1954, p. 30.

See also Amarasimha 1954, Khanda II, n. 107 mrdvik? gostani draks? sv?dvi madhuraseti; etym. of the pandits: dr?ti rasa vattv?d draks?. That dr?ks? was imported to India from Kapisa is confirmed by P?nini IV, 2, 99: K?pis?yini dr?ks?. 33</page><page sequence="26">In the Vinaya of the M?lasarv?stiv?dins we are told that during the journey of the Buddha to the north-western part of the Subcontinent, the Yaksa Kutila sent to a temple, where the Buddha was resting with some bhiksus, grapes and other fruits. The monks had never seen the grapes and they asked the Buddha how they could be eaten. The Buddha replied that they are to be eaten after having purified them, touching them in three different points with a hot coal. Later the Buddha explained that one can press them and make a juice out of them; this juice can be preserved in the store room; it could be used by the Sangha as a syrup (Przyluski 1914, p. 494). Though the reply rests with the analysts who are examining the earth excavated from the houses of Aligr?ma, I do not think that we are wrong in surmising that juniper was known as a plant employed in certain rituals, as it happens also today among the Kafirs; also today in Sw?t juniper is burnt on some fire-stands for the suffimenta prac? tised by the witches: Morgenstierne G. 1947, Id. 1973, p. 320, Fussman 1977, p. 34, p. 44, Snoy 1962, index, s.v., Tucci 1963, p. 155 note (37a). The suffimentum by means of burnt juniper is essential in the Bon po cults of Tibet and in the popular religion of Tibet. (Tucci 1970, p. 188 ff.). Among the Na-khi juniper is not only used in the liturgy but it is deified (uncle of Heaven. Rock 1948, p. 42. The Na-khi ceremony inspired one poem of Ezra Pound, Lanciotti EW, 1970, XX, p. 375). Nothing so far has been found of imposing diversity among the tombs or the houses till now explored, I am therefore inclined to imagine some tribal confederations living in a condition of common equality: up to now no hint at a centralized power; wheat was collected in pits in the houses; no trace of accumulation of goods of general use to the entire community. Therefore we cannot say if there was a division into classes during the periods so far explored. From the material so far discovered such conclusion seems excluded. Of course, we cannot say that all of the migrating tribes settled here; many must have pushed their way down towards the plains of India. It is also possible that some of the first Dardic tribes reached the Indus and then they were repulsed back by IA settled there or by other peoples. Fighting among the first settlers may also have compelled some of them to abandon the previous settlements in order to find out a quieter place. In the Vedic literature, the rivalries of the different tribes are often testified: the south-eastwards migrations, however, did not succeed in obli? terating the traces of the former origins and relationships, and the analogies in customs and habits; though gradually, as the march for the conquest of the Subcontinent progres? sed, together with the contacts with other ethnic groups and cultures, the former social and cultural similarities might have been loosened in the course of time. Thus, from the excavations so far undertaken in the prehistoric and protohistoric graveyards of Sw?t it seems that on some more ancient population or populations, whose (37a) On the "twig-putting juniper" ceremony and the "head-hoof juniper" ceremony see Mor GENSTIERNE 1973, p. 175. 34</page><page sequence="27">identity cannot be determined (one of them may well be an ethnic group of which a) we have a survival only in a language which cannot, as yet, be connected with any known language, like the Burushaski or b) single words in modern dialects, of which no relation with any other known word of whatever language can be proposed), various migrations frequently spread, mainly, not only, from the north, with certain hiatuses generally repre? senting different cultures testified by other types of ware. I have in mind chiefly Central Asia as the place of origin of the majority of these migrations, which continued up to periods more recent than those testified by the early settlement of Loebanr 1700 B.C. Some of them, as I have said, being already in the Pamirs, might have shifted south-wards driving away other people in the unsettled and unstable ethnic map of the region. In a very interesting article ? The Pro to-Indo-Aryans ? (JRAS, 1973, pp. 123 ff.) T. Burrow argues that ? an ancient conglomeration of tribes of Proto-Indo-Aryans, that can? not be brought down earlier than 2000 B.C. split itself in different periods into two main branches: Indo-Aryan and Iranian ?. Linguistically, Pro to-Indo-Aryan refers to ? that stage of language existing before the migrations into India after the separation from Iranian ?. Some of these tribes of the linguistically Proto-Indo-Aryan period went westwards, settled in the Near East (Mitanni), and eastwards in North and Eastern Sist?n. The Iranians ? began to move South and by degrees, took over the territory previously occupied by Indo-Aryans ?. About 1400 B.C. (Burrow 1973, p. 140) the Iranians came down and occupied the Iranian and Afghan Sist?n, places where the Indo-Aryan previous migrations had settled. This fact brought to the possible expulsion of Indo-Aryans (38) settled in Sist?n (Iranian as well as Afghan) or to a possible coexistence of the two groups for a certain period; this is a fact of great importance which cannot be forgotten when the study of Dahan-i Ghul?m?n will be taken up again or new excavations will be undertaken in that place. Dahan-i Ghul?m?n may be a town and a temple built by the Indo-Aryans ? while settled in Sist?n ? a fact that would direct its reading and interpretation more to Vedic literature and lore. It is also a fact which also the archaeologists should con? sider because some Indo-Aryans compelled by the Iranians might have migrated westwards introducing in Sw?t cultural elements of Iranian inspiration. The occupation by the Iranians of this part of Sist?n already inhabitated for some time by the Indo-Aryans took place according to Burrow 1973 (p. 135) not later than the 14th century B.C. when already a numerous and important migration had descended to India. (38) By Proto-Indo-Aryans Prof. Burrow refers to the stage of the language existing before the migrations into India and after the separation from the Iranians. Its phonology can be partially reconstructed by the comparison of Indo-Aryan and K?fir which is not to be regarded as a separate branch of Aryan but as descended from the Proto Indo-Aryan (Burrow 1973, p. 125). 35</page><page sequence="28">But we may acknowledge that, on the whole, in spite of the many migrations, we can safely affirm that in Swat we are confronted with a series of homologous cultures; notwithstanding the evident differences, in space and time, and of some details in shape and colours of the artefacts. I think that we must agree with Prof. Stacul, when he writes "Starting from the 14th or the 13th century B.C. the majority of the north-west regions of the subcontinent came under the sway of a relative unitary culture. The first evidence, relating to the latter fact was gathered in the Sw?t Valley and then in the settlement of Ch?rsadda. It was followed by further evidence from Dir region, the district of K?l?m, and the neighbourhood of Peshawar. The same culture with some va? riants can be attested also in northern Baluchistan'. (Stacul 1974, p. 241). This article was in the press, when I received the very important book of R. Ghirshman Ulran et la migration des Indo-Aryens et des Iranien (Leiden, 1977). My learned colleague on the basis of the archaeological finds is of the opinion that a large branch of the Indo-Aryans (who introduced the black ware) had already settled about 3000 B.C. in the N.E. of Iran; but about the middle of the second millennium it was compel? led by new nomadic incursions to abandon the places it had occupied. There is a diffe? rence in chronology and other details between linguists and archaeologists, but both agree on the presence of Indo Aryans in N.E. Iran and (the linguists) in East Iran generally; both suppose that about the middle of the second millenium B.C. they were driven away by other peoples. Russian archaeologists (see Kuzmina 1976) and their excavations have also shown that without any doubt other migrations came down in successive waves from the north; thus apart from certain differences in chronology it seems ascertained that we can come to the conclusions that a) Indo-Aryans [or Pro to Indo-Aryans (39)] departed from a pre? viously occupied territory in East Iran and North East Iran, b) that the Iranians drove them away or superimposed themselves on their predecessors, c) that other waves descen? ded through the Pamirs and the Hindukush. These are the problems which archaeologists should now solve. We cannot as yet determine the time of arrival of different migrations of the Dards and of the other tribes which followed them and assign each wave to any of the periods established by Prof. Stacul. But we may well date the first migrations a little before the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C.; this chronological conclusion is not contradicted by the theory of Prof. Burrow nor by the datation through C. 14 (oldest Loebanr 1700 c.\ thus also oldest Aligr?ma). The Hindus did not forget their relationship with these tribes, but on account of the seclu? sion of the Dards and related tribes within the mountains (p?rvatiya), the Dards are said to have forgotten many fundamental Vedic prescriptions or rituals and were therefore consi? dered as impure Ksatriyas (though some of them were later partially rehabilitated) (39a). We know that some Dardic dialects (Kalash and Khow?r) ? represent the most (39) K?firs.

Though ? they do not contain any fea? ture which could not be derived from ancient I.A., they have preserved a certain number of notable archaisms which have disappeared in the prakrit dialects ?. This does not imply that we have to suppose that from the beginning to the end, Sw?t was the habitat, as well as older settlements, of the Dardic tribes only; other related groups might have joined or followed them coming down from the Central Asian reservoir, through the same or parallel routes. On the whole they represent one of the most impressive migrations in extension and in time which took possession of the Pamirs, the Hindukush, north up to Gilgit, east to Baltistan and Western Tibet, south down to Kashmir, west up to Chitr?l. In Mbh, XV 207, 42, 44, those peoples in the mountains and in the North-West like the Yaunas, the Gandh?ras, the Kir?tas of the Uttar?p?tha, the Barbaras, are considered to be criminal tribes, hunters; and Manu, X 43-44 adds: ? in consequence of the omission of the sacred rites ... the following tribes of Kshatriyas have gradually sunk in this world to the condition of S?dras; (viz.) the Paundrakas, the Codas, the Dravidas, the K?mbojas, the Yavanas, the Sakas, the P?radas, the Pahlavas, the Qnas, the Kir?tas, and the Da radas ? (transl. B?hler). The list in P?nini, V 3, 114-115 says that they were organized in samghas. Mbh. and Manu state that many of those tribes were ?yudh?fivi, ? they are living on the use of weapons ?, and organized in samghas: a) V?hika (not to be confounded with the B?hlika) (Tucci 1963, p. 162); b) P?rvata (P?nini, 14, 3, 112 living in the mountains); c) P?ga associations under a gr?mam; d) Vr?ta (40). We know fairly well the organization of Vedic and postvedic jana: their ganas with their sabh?, etc., but little about these tribes of warriors of whom some were allowed, in later times, to enter into the class of the Ksatriyas; while some others were considered as outcast Ksatriyas for having persisted in their unorthodox practices. Among the P?gas, under a council of Elders who elected a leader, there are the Kum?ra-P?gas "youth congregations" (P?nini, VI 2, 28). Some were called ? having an iron standard ?. It is quite possible that many of these mountain tribes, ? living by their own sword ?, were dosed military organizations to which one was allowed after some initiation ceremonies, something similar to the "M?nnerbunde" of Iran so well studied by Wikander (40a). Agrawala 1953, pp. 438-39 has briefly dealt with this problem and referring to some passages of the epics is inclined to locate them on the banks of the Indus and extends their loca? lization up to the N. Western Frontier. But many of his proposed identifications deserve revision, which is beyond the scope of the present research. It is anyhow certain that the elders of the P?gas elected a chief gr?mant. His main duty was to be responsible for the Kum?ra-p?gas, the youth of the tribe; the name Kum?ra was followed by the family name: some of these names are peculiar like Kum?ra-Lohadhvajah, '"Kum?ra-iron flag".

Zimmer, Altindisches Le? ben, 1879, p. 294 ff.); in a few skeletons examined by Prof. Alciati a group of four show traces of healed traumatic accidents. Any hypothesis on the organizations of these groups once they settled down, on ac? count of the scanty material we possess, can be only a mere guessing. That they were divided into tribes composed of different clans seems to me the most probable; they must have had a kind of a council of elders for the solution of any problem involving the inte? rests of the community; delimitation of pasture grounds and such like eventual disputes. In case of necessity the tribes united their forces and selected a most able man to be the leader. It is possible that a tribe like that of the Assakenoi, asserted its supremacy over the others and assumed a kind of hegemony. They fought because their independence was at stake. As soon as M?ssaga fell and Aornos was captured the confederation collapsed. It is interesting to record what Sung Y?n says concerning the penal law enforced in Swat. Criminals were not killed or executed, but sent to a desert, or to a mountain and left there, free to seek out water and eatable herbs or fruits or other things necessary for their survival; in doubtful cases, a drug was given to them, whose scope was to detect the culprit and the innocent. The same custom still esists among the Kafirs (42): a murderer is exiled approximately towards Badakhsh?n in the north, in a desolate plain where he can find only millet and wheat; he may take with him his wife if she is willing to follow him (Morgenstierne 1933, p. 298). In later times, we find the mention in a Buddhist text of a yaksa specially worshipped by the Dards; he is called, according to the Mah?m?y?ri, Mandara. Levi 1915. It may be the Sanskritization of a local deity of some Dardic tribe. But which one? From the coins of the Asvak? (Assakenoi) that survived for some time we may infer that at least the Assakenoi might have practised totemic cults; the totem giving the name to the tribe was the fig-tree Vata (see below p. 46). In the Mauryan period in what we called the "bazaar" in the valley beneath the castle of Rajgira, the skull of a bovine (a young cow? a calf?) was found painted with carminium; it may be a testimonial of a sacrifice, and of the presence of families not yet converted to Buddhism: it is known that among the Kafirs and the Dards a cow was not considered to be sacred but not rarely it was an impure animal; sacrifices of cows and calves were practised by the Kafirs and some Pamir tribes up to recent times. The presence of Hinduism in Sw?t is certain (see p. 58, note 72). (41) On the petroglyphs of G?gdara rep? resenting war chariots and flags see appendix by Prof. Brentjes at the end of this article. C42) Cf. T'ang-shu, where it is said that the persons suspected of some infringement of the Law were subject to an ordeal. They were given a drug: if their urine was clear the punishment was light; if it was not, the punishment was heavy {T'ang-shu, ch. 171; Chavannes 1903, p. 128). Prof. L. Lanciotti calls my attention to the Pei-shih ch. 97 where we find the same state? ment: to the suspected culprits a drug is given: if one maddens one is guilty. A murderer is not executed but banished to a mountain. 38</page><page sequence="31">IV Rivers 19. If we follow the itinerary of Alexander to Sw?t we meet a series of tribes, (and some of them having homologous names): Aspasioi &lt;Aspioi?&gt;, Assakenoi, the Gureioi; Sw?t is Soastene for the Greeks, Suv?stu "having good dwelling" for the Vedas and P?nini IV, 2, 771 (Hu-asp for the Iranians?). But we find in Sw?t another people: the Urdi, Aurddi, Udi (Tucci 1958, p. 326); then a name Wu ch'a, which could be taken as an older transcrip? tion, is found in the Commentary (chu) by Li Tao-yiian (t 527) on the Shui-ching-chu "The classic of the Waters" (written in the 3rd century): ? Kuo I-kung [lived under the Chin dynasty (265-420)] says that west of Wu ch'a (uo-d'a, Uda) there is the country of "the hanging passages" ? (cf. Hsiian-tsang). In another passage Kuo I-kung also says that after crossing the "Hanging passa? ges" there is a plain, which prof. Petech (43) identifies, rightly to my mind, with Gilgit (or better Yasin?). Wu ch'a here = Uda; but it has nothing to do with Uddiy?na (44) which is much to the south of it. Possibly it corresponds to Sarikol (so Hermann in Sven Hedin 1916-1922, vol. VIII, pp. 19 and 451: south of Yarkand and Prof. Petech seems to accept his view). But if Uda has no relation with our Ora, Urdi, the Yii ti yen mentioned by T'ang shu (Chavannes 1903, p. 160 and Levi in Mm., p. 167) certainly refers to our Uddiy?na: if there is some difference as regards the products of the soil and the climate, it contains a detail which points to the penal laws, similar to those described by the Chinese pilgrims (see above, p. 38). S. Levi ibid, compares also the name Y? tien na, Uddiy?na with that of Khotan, in Chinese Y? tien. Udi, Urdi, Udri, Ude is the name of another tribe which con? federated with the Assakenoi and probably represents an ethnic group related to them, but quite separate. As regards the Urdi (inhabitants of Ora) we quote from the V?rtika in IV, 2, 99 Kapisy?h sphak; in Kapisi the suffix + ?, a with feminine in 1: Bahlyurdibhy?s ceti vak tavyam: b?hl?yant aurdd?yarii p?rd?yarii (Patanjali, vol. IV, p. 185). The change of a dental d into d can be explained considering that Uddi may be a local pronunciation which ac? counts for the Ora of the Greek historians influenced by the frication characteristic of those dialects. The Tibetan name Orgyan is so explained by Buddhagupta, a Tibetan pilgrim who went to Sw?t in the 16th century: ? The name Orgyan is derived from Uddiy?na on ac? count of the similarity [in pronunciation of d and r] ? (45); the insertion of an r is frequent in N. W. padriyamsae (Konow, in CII, 5, 4, s. v.); pratithavitra, B?jaur casket (EI, XXIV, (43) Petech 1950, p. 18. (44) As L?ders thought 1940, p. 496.

This implies a fricative intervocalic change: cf. t&lt;Lr in mo? dern Kowar. 20. Nysa Once More Before entering the territory of the Assakenoi, Curtius introduces the story of Nysa (VIII 10, 71) which Arrianus (V 1 ff.) tells at the beginning of the next chapter, aftei Alexander had crossed the Indus and defeated the Assakenoi. The story goes back perhaps to Megasthenes, or to some other old source, because it is reported by other Greek and Latin writers. The location of the place is uncertain (46): ?between Kophes and the Indus? is too vague. The connection of the place with Dionysos and the clas? sical Nysa, seems to support the doubt that here the context has been exaggerated by the Macedonians, in their desire to flatter the aspiration of Alexander to be deified. But the existence of an historical Nysa or of a place of a similar name in this part of the world seems to be certain. Also Strabo mentions the Nys?ioi, evidently the inhabitants of Nysa, located near the Ippasioi (Asp&lt;as&gt;ioi). ? Between Ko? phes and the Indus there are the Astaken?i, (47) Masian?i, Nys?ioi, Ypp?sioi (48), Massoga (49) capital of Assak?nos; near the Indus there is Peukela?itis ? (XV 1, 27). The story goes that the people went to meet Alexander, and said that they were descended from Dionysos, who was born in a cave from the femur {meros) of Jupiter. This means first of all that near that place there was a mountain whose name sounded to the Greeks like meros (i.e.: Meru, the centre of the world according to Indian cosmography; see above, p. 27); what in? duced the Macedonians to accept the story was the fact that in that place there grew ivy and grapes, though, on account of the climate, they did not ripen well (but Diodorus speaks of the good climate of the place); thus Alexander ascended the mountain, followed by people wearing ivy on their heads and drinking wine. Nysa is probably to be found in a land where Kafirs or Dards were living; Kafirs and Dards were and still are generally fine-looking, especially the women, and before Islamiza tion they remained quite isolated, and specially the Kafirs with a religion of their own. Be that as it may, the tradition concerning the inhabitants of Nysa, as recorded by Arrianus, is that they considered themselves to be foreigners, immigrated there and different from the Indians: NuaaToi be ov% TvSix?v ysvog eativ, ?Xk? tcov a\ia Aiorudco eXOovtcov eg tt]v yfjv taiv 9Iv8cov Some travellers have been so surprised by these facts that they have spread a theory, which certainly has no historic background, but is none the less indicative: they imagined that the Kafirs were the descendants of the soldiers of Alexander. (On the tradition that (46) The problem of Nysa has been discussed by Smith 1914. Cf. T.A. Holdich, The Gates of India, 1910, who identified Meros with Koh-i Mor, followed by Smith; but the identification can hardly be accepted. On the other hand Mor genstierne 1931 thinks it to be the Tiric Mir in Chitr?l. See above, p. 27. (47) Perhaps, through an Iranian intermediary, from Hastakene from Astis, Astes, former unre? liable governor of Peukelaoitis; the separate men? tion of Massoga excludes the identification of the Astakenoi with the Assakenoi.

According to Sch?mberg 1935, p. 106 the Mir of Nagir claimed to be a descendant of Alexander). A similar story is told regarding the people of Kunar, by one of the informers of Morgenstierne 1956, I.I.F.L. vol. Ill s.v. "Kunar": according to A[bdur] R[ashid] the people are Germans who have sought refuge there and embraced Islam ?. Is the name of Nysa surviving in Nisai, Nisa'i (Kunar dialect, also registered in the dictionary by Prof. Morgenstierne, p. 215)? 21. The K?phes Having left Tiriaspes as satrap of the Paropamisadae and the remaining part of the country up to the K?phes (Kabul) river, Alexander reached Nicaea, which Foucher places near Mundrawar in Laghman, where near Karglai, the Alingar and the Alishang after their confluence empty themselves in the K?phes. In that place he sacrificed to Minerva and then he proceeded to the K?phes, from where he sent for Taxiles the ruler of Taxila; the latter arrived soon with his elephants, and Alexander gave orders to Hephaisti?n to conquer Peukela?itis and then to proceed to the Indus in order to build there a bridge near Udabh?nda (50) (Ohind, Vahind). To sum up the account of the itinerary of Alexan? der, he did not follow the course of the Kabul river, but went northwards: ? considering that the rivers to cross, all flowing southwards, represented a difficulty he cut straight through the country ?. Strabo XV, 1, 26 writes: ? accordingly, he returned, passing over the same mountains by other and shorter roads, keeping India on the left; he turned immediately towards India and its Western boundaries and the K?phes river and the Choaspes, which latter empties into the river K?phes near a city Plemyrium (51) after going past Gorys, another city, and flowing further through both Bandobene and Gandaritis ?. He wanted to reach first of all Massaga, the capital of the Assakenoi. Many theories have been advanced concerning the location of this town. Stein did not commit himself on this point, Dani places it near the ziy?rat of Mujawar Baba. Sir Olaf Caroe placed it near the Katgala pass between the Tal?sh and Adinazai pass, about 8 miles from Chakdarra, on the way to Dir. This is possible, but perhaps other archaeological excavations on a large scale, are needed to prove it. Curtius refers to the fact that it was difficult to capture the town, not only on account of its fortifications but also because, on the east, it was protected by a violent river with high banks: (? qua spectat orientem, cingitur amne torrenti, qui praeruptis utrimque ripis, aditum ad urbem impedit ? (VIII 37) (52). (50) Udabh?nda may also have two alternative spellings: Udakh?nda and Udabh?nda; the first survives in the name of the village Khunda (according to Colonel Deane in Foucher 1901, p. 367, note and Mm., p. 73). It is to be added that Bhandu and Khandu are quoted in Gana p?tha 4, 2, 77. See also Eggermont 1975, pp. 139, 176. In Udakh?nda, kh?nda is a Saka word for ctown, village'. (51) Variae lectiones: Pligyrion and Piekerion. (52) The expression of Curtius currenti amne praeruptis ripis indicates what today is called a 41</page><page sequence="34">Masak?vatI mentioned in the Bh?sya (IV 2, 71) must be here recorded because its name cannot be isolated from that of Massaga; it is quoted as the name of a river, though the suffix- vati can be applied also to a town (Puskal?vati). But the important fact is the presence of such a toponymy in the NW part of the subcontinent. It is also interesting that near Aligr?ma there is a khwar which is now called Mahak &gt; Masak. 22. Mas saga Also the spelling of M?ssaga differs in the various texts: Massaga (Indike, I, 8), Ma s?ga (Strabo XV 1, 27), Maz?ga (Curtius VIII 10, 22). Also the name of the Assakenoi (Arrianus IV 30, 5) is variously spelt: Assak?nos is their king, Arrianus IV 27, 4, 30, 5; Strabo XV 1, 27 Ass?kenos. In Arrianus IV 27, 5: Massakan?n evidently from the name of the capital (IV 27, 5). According to Arrianus, when Alexander saw the imposing fortifications of the town, in order to deceive its defenders and to force them to evacuate the fortress, he ordered his troops to retire about seven stadia from the place where he had pitched his camp; this seems to indicate that the town was not very far from the Panjkora which he had just crossed. Now we must reconsider the itinerary of Alexander from Afghanistan to Sw?t and enu? merate the rivers which he had to cross. 23. From Afghanistan to M?ssaga Hephaisti?n and Perdicca had already accomplished their tasks to subdue by force or compel to surrender the towns met on their way, and to gather provisions in Emb?lima etc., before undertaking the building of the bridge; they killed the traitor Astes, Astis (see above, p. 40), the governor of Peukelaoitis and his territory was then put under the com? mand of Taksiles, who was on friendly terms with the Macedonians. Alexander himself proceeded first along the K?phes (Kabul) river and then, as we saw, turning northward, he subdued some tribes called Aspii (Arrianus IV 23, 1, corrected by Roos into Asp&lt;as&gt;ioi); Strabo XV 1, 21 has Ypasioi (Tzschucke emends into Ippasioi, Corais into Aspasioi: (see above, p. 40). We must remenber what has been already said that the importance of Massaga was such as to give the Assakenoi also its name: Massa genoi (Massagenon). The confederacy under the dominion of the Assakenoi was called Assakie: ev 'Atfaaxr|Voiai 8e Mdaaaxa, Ttoliq \ieydlr\, ivajteo xal to xgatoc, xr\q yf\q eati tfjg 'AaacouTjg xal ocaXy) jtoau; neuxeAalticJ fieydAT] xal avxv\ ov uaxodv xov Tv8oft. xavxa jxev e^co xov TvSoft jiotajxoii awiatai tzqoc, sajtepriv ears ercl tov Kcoqpfjva, td 8e arco xov Tv8o\) nobq 8co toirt?

Peukel. It is a fact that the name Gandh?ra does not appear khwar, an impetuous torrent, which runs violently in spring, or in the rainy season: it digs in the cretaceous soil deep ravines, difficult to cross; it usually dries up in the hot months; Alexander was in M?ssaga in about November of 327 B.C. 42</page><page sequence="35">in Arrianus. The Assakenoi settling in the main parts of the land which is usually known as Gandh?ra gave to this country their own name: Assakie up to Pusk?lavati, between the Indian territory to the east and the Assakenian possessions to the west of the Indus. In the "Daedala" territory, Sw?t was known to the Greek writers by the name derived from that of the river: Soastene (for the formation of this name cf. p. 45) from Vedic Suv?stu chaving fair dwellings'5 (Ptolemaeus VII 1, 42: ? Below the sources of the S?astos (53) is Souastene ?). Now we must go back a little and say a few words on the territories which Alexan? der had to pass through and on the rivers he had to cross. The problem of the identification of the rivers is complicated; in the Anabasis there is no mention of the Choaspes, which has been generally identified with the Kunar; on the other hand Curtius says that Alexander invaded the Darada (Daedala) country after having crossed the Choaspes; he sent Coenos to besiege Beira ? Bazira (54), Barikot on the left bank of the river and only then he himself went to M?zaga. According to Arrianus the first river crossed by Alexander was the Xoe (IV 23, 2). In Strabo already quoted (see above, p. 40), the itinerary is more inaccurately descri? bed, and many names are misspelt. Strabo XV 1, 27: ?Now after the Kophes fol? lows the Indus; and the region between these rivers is occupied by the Astakenoi, Masia noi (other MSS. Basianoi) Nys?ioi and Hipasioi (Tzschucke emends into Ippasioi, Gorais into Aspasioi) and then one comes to the country of Ass?kenos where is a city of Masaga, the capital of the country; and now near the Indus again one comes to another city, Peukol?itis ?. But in Indike I 4-12 Arrianus writes: Kcocprjv 8e ev ITevxeXaitiSi, a\?a ol aycav MaXdfiavt?v re %ai Sockttov xal rViQOiav, ex?iSot eg tov Tv8o'v. xa?imeQfre toirceoov IlaQQevog xai 2djtaQvog, ov noXv ?iexovteg, e^?dXXouaiv eg tov 3Iv86v. Evidently this passage poses some problems: the insertion of Malamantos, which runs into the K?phes along with the Panjkora and the S?astos (Sw?t); if Malamantos corresponds to Bandobene, etc., as Eggermont surmises, it has nothing to do with the K?bul basin but it has with the Indus; then only two solutions are possible: a) that the theory of Prof. Eggermont, at least here, that Malamantos = Bandobene = Udabh?nda is not valid; b) that the Malamantos probably corresponds to the Kalp?ni N?la running into the Kabul near Nowshera. The two rivers mentioned at the end cannot but be included in the Udabh?nda dis? trict (South-eastern Buner). One of them Saparnos (Suparna?) must be the Barandu. As to P?r renos I propose to identify it with the Pur an in proximity of Dard and flowing near Sond?l, Kul?la, Kh?nai: it empties into the Indus near Ch?r?nai. Nevertheless the two passages of Arrianus Indike (cf. p. 42) though erroneous in some details, are very important. The K?phes is like the spine of the region (53) Cf. below, p. 45. (M) Original name, as we infer from the inscription of Jayap?ladeva (Tucci 1958): Vaji rasth?na. 43</page><page sequence="36">which is called Gandh?ra: its eastern part and boundary is Peukelaoitis, Puskalavati: the whole territory to the east of that town is India proper; the part to the west of it is traversed north-south by many rivers which run into the K?phes: Malamantos, Souastos, Goruaia: about Souastos there is no doubt = Suv?stu, Sw?t; Goruaia corresponds to Goreis near the Panjkora. Malamantos cannot be Malamantos = Bandobene (the river of Uda bh?nda) because any river near Bandobene runs into the Indus not into the K?phes (cf. above, p. 43); Arrianus himself says that these rivers flow into the Indus, above its junction with the K?phes (54a). Here it is useful to see how Ptolemaeus (Renou 1925, p. 12) describes the succession of the rivers in this part of the world and to compare the statements of the various sources. 26 eH Se x&amp;siq tcov elc, t?v TvS?v pe?vtcov Jtotau-cov drc? xov *I\idov opoug ovxcoq e/ei.

Gandaritis is no problem: it is (see above) the region west of Peukelaoitis, Puskal?vatl. Bandobene whether it has any relation with Malamantos or with Udabh?nda corresponds roughly to SE Buner and nearby territories and its rivers do not run into the K?bul but into the Indus to the north of the junction of the K?bul and the Sw?t rivers.

Ptolemaeus VIII 1, VII 1, 26, VII 1, 42, states that, so far as our region is concerned, from the Imaios mount the following rivers descend: Ch?a, Souastos, Indus: the Lamp? kas (L?mbagai, inhabitants of Laghman) are mentioned twice: in the beginning (below the river Ch?a) and at the end (below Sw?t, Souastene); no mention is made of the K?bul river, though of the Ch?a is mentioned its "divarication" towards the Paropami(^^.ni)sadai. 24. Aspasioi and Assakenoi The Aspasioi, Ippasioi of Strabo can be compared to asp or K?firi aspu or to other local dialects: cf. The G?ndh?ri Dharmap?da: aspaveka ? asvamedha (Brough 1962, p. 103). The correspondence of Asvayana with P?ninian Asv?yana is certain: asv?di bhyah phan: aiva becomes name of family by adding ?yana (4, I, 110). More difficult to explain is the suffix -sioi of Aspasioi. But we must not forget that in other readings we find aspioi. From Asva, Asva-ka is derived (P?nini, IV, 2, 131 with taddhita-ka) and from Asva-ka: Asva-ka-?yana '"pertaining to a certain family, a remote descendant" (?yana, P?? nini, IV, I, 99): in conclusion Asva-ka-?yana (56); but the relation between Skr. Asvak?yana, or Prak. Assak?yana, and Greek Assakenoi is doubtful. Easier, to my mind, is the follow? ing sequence: Asva-ka, Assaka, Assakia, Assakene (as Massagen?i from M?ssaga) with the usual Greek suffix enos (like Paritakene, Soastene etc. (56a). We must remember that the form Asvaka is found in some coins discovered in Taxila and datable 3rd-2nd century B.C.: Vatasvaka. On these coins the inscription Vatasvaka was interpreted by B?hler and Smith as the (56) The form asvak?yana is nothing else than the P?ninian indication of a patronimic; it does not interest us here. (***) PlEMONTESE, 1970, p. 109. 45</page><page sequence="38">"Asvaka of the Vata", the fig-tree, considering this plant as their totem. Recently Dr Kalyan Kumar Dasgupta took up again the study of this problem (Dasgupta 1974, p. 29), complete with all bibliographical references and a clear statement on the actual situation of researches on this subject. The learned author makes a clear distinction be? tween the Asvakas, ?svakas and the ?smakas (both in Prakrit Assaka, ?ssaka) and locates the ?smakas, perhaps after a migration from a previous settlement, near the God?vari, as they appear in list of the Sodasajanapadas (56b). Of the ?smakas no coins are known so far. Dr K. K. Dasgupta also proposed the interpretation of Vat a as ^cowrie shelP, used as a means of exchanging commodities: so the formula Vatasvaka could correspond (see P?nini II 2, 31) to Asvak?n?m Vat ah ccoin of Asvaka'. But after discussing this possibility, he concludes that the real meaning should be "the Asvaka tribe of the vata or fig-tree clan". In the same paper is also discussed the problem: Dr Dasgupta and myself agree on the different location of the two tribes (57) and their reciprocal difference. In his book, Dates and Dynasties of Earliest India, R. Morton Smith (1973) has tried to establish a chronological series of the principal dynasties and kings, as it may be recon? structed from the Pur?nas. I too, in a paper now republished in Opera Minor a have hinted at the possibility that even in fairly old times there existed certain reliable lists of such kings; but I have some doubts about the reliability of the chronological dates, because I do not know how we can rely on documents on which to build up an irrefutable chronology. I think that we are chiefly confronted with Vams?vatis of different traditional value, and we have not yet established an unquestionable documentation on the Pur?nic tradition. Ac? cording to Smith 1973, an Asmaka mother or wife of An?drsti and a second one wife of Pr?cinavant, and still a third one, wife of S?ra, are dated 1200 B.C. and 1300 B.C. Nothing can be inferred from this, except that, as already stated, at a certain time there was a tribe of the ?smakas of old extraction, in the list of Pur?nas. 25. Again the March of Alexander There are still other points not easy to interpret (58). Alexander keeps in the begin? ning India to his left, i.e. descends from Bactria by mountain tracks, then he marches in the direction of India and the Kabul river, which means that he followed the same direc? tion of the Kabul river; but as regards the Choaspes he had no other solution than to Asmaka Asvaka C56*) The Brhatsamhit? XIV v. 21 locates the ?smakakul?tas (Kulu) in the NW quarter: there? fore they are considered by that text or its sources to be different from the ?smakas along the Go d?vari. It may also be that it interprets ?ssaka, ?smaka as the Asvaka in the N. (57) It is another indication pointing to the fact that after Alexander's times there took place certain events which provoked a southward - or south-eastward movement of some peoples. (58) Strabo also writes: ? he reached out for India too, since many men had been describing it (the itinerary) to him, though not clearly ?. 46</page><page sequence="39">cross it; we know that the Choaspes empties in the Kabul river, near a town called Plemy rium, but it is said to be jiapa TcopvSa past the territory of the Gor?ioi, which means beyond the Panjkora. Therefore the Ch?a or Khoa cannot but be the Kunar, which runs west of the Panjkora; this empties in the Sw?t; and runs into it; as a result the Choaspes of Curtius, as the boundary of the territory of the Dedalai - Daradas, could be interpreted - as was proposed by Marquart and accepted by Stein - as an Iranization: Hu-aspa cgood horse5, of the name Suvas tu known in the Vedas (58a). I therefore think that the Ch?a of Arrianus and Ptolemaeus corresponds to the Kunar (?9); its name suggests that of the Dardic tribes Kho, living in Chitr?l (Kho) and ancient Sw?t. Their language is ? die Verkehrsprache of the Kafiri in Chitral ? (Snoy 1962, p. 86), and it is called Khowar. ? In many respects [it is] the most archaic of all modern Indian languages, retaining a great part of Sanskrit inflexion ? (Morgenstierne, Els.) (60). The same idea was again accepted by A. Stein (1921, I, p. 4, note 2). Already in 1927, p. 424, Stein wrote: ? There is good reason to believe that the languages then spo? ken in that region and in the adjacent hill tracts including Sw?t were not Indian, but belonging to that independent branch of Aryan speech, designated as Dard or Dardic, which has still its representatives in valleys South of the Hindukush from Kafiristan to Kashmir?. Many factors contribute to render complex and difficult the problem of the identification of the different places. The interpreters and informants were Persians, Indians, local peoples of different intelligence and sometimes also of relative knowledge of the places of which they were speaking. 26. The Conquest of Mas saga On his way to M?ssaga Alexander, as we saw, had captured Andraka (identification uncertain) (61). Here in the critical edition of Roos IV 24, 1 is indicated a lacuna: *Evao . ' TtoXeoq JCQOt^coQei, Tva 6 tcav 'Acrjtaalcov fijtOQX0? The editor expresses the view that in that lacuna the name of the town must have disappeared, as it seems evident from the sentence immediately following: ? where the chief of the Asp&lt;as&gt;ioi resides ?; other editors, with less probability, inserted here the name of the river Sw?t. Thus Evaspla should be deleted from the list of the rivers crossed by Alexander. (58a) The I A, having mainly wooden or mud houses (see Burrow in Basham 1975, p. 25) must have been greatly impressed by the stone-houses of Sw?t; therefore the traditional interpretation of Suv?stu: ?The place of fine dwellings ? may appear, in the light of the recent excavations, equally adequate. (59) This indication was already proposed by Lassen (Indische Alterthumskunde, II, 2nd ed., p. 137) who was a great forerunner in the field of ancient Indian geography and on many points can still be considered an invaluable source of information. (60) On the position between Dardic and Ka firi according to later researches, see Morgenstier ne, Els s.v. Dardistan and Kafir. (61) We may perhaps connect Andraka with a Kowar word, adrakax (&lt;j Kalasa adrakh "hillside, forest5): Morgenstierne 1973, p. 332. 47</page><page sequence="40">Reaching then a burnt and abandoned town, Arigaion, he entered the territory of the Guraioi on the river by the same name (Gouraios p. 44) and marched towards Massaga. About the Guraios river which has been identified, I suppose rightly, with the Pa? njkora, Prof. Dani (1967, pp. 49-55) develops an interesting theory which, I am afraid, can hardly be accepted. He thinks that the Guraioi correspond to the Kurus, who are not mentioned in the Vedas (only in some derivative forms), and in Panjkora he sees a survi? val of P?nc?la-Kuru. But if Panc?la and Kuru are generally quoted jointly and are considered to be strictly connected, the usual expression is Kuru-P?nc?la and not P?nc?la-Kuru. Moreover we know that the Greek transcription of the name Kuru is Korrhai (see e.g. in Ptolemaeus Ottokorrhai = Uttara-kuru, VI ? 1 and 6; Plinius IV 60, Attacori). The identification of the Guraioi has been discussed since the times of Lassen, who states that the name of this river corresponds to old GaurT, so also Stein 1921, I, p. 2, note 2); much more acceptable is Garuh? or Guruh? quoted as being in the north-western quarter in the Brhatsamhit?. The Uttarakurus, mentioned in the Aitareya Br?hmana (VIII 14) as an historic people are located parena Himalayam, beyond the Him?laya. In the lists of the Saddharmasmrtyu pasth?na and of the R?m?yana (Levi 1918, p. 48) the Kurus are placed along with the M?drak?s; S. Levi suggests that they should be located near the subHimalayan Northern Tribes (ibid., p. 124). Later their land becomes in Hindu cosmography a kind of paradise on earth. Also in some Buddhist texts, as noted by Law 1943, p. 21 there seems to have lingered the memory of an historical country in Uuaradvlpa (Malalasekera 1937, p. 355). However if the "Guraioi" have nothing to do with the Kurus, there are in Chitr?l, two summer hamlets whose names are Harigram and Kuru. Harigram, as Prof. Morgen stierne suggests, is certainly a small Hindu colony or settlement; but near it there is another summer hamlet called Kuru, and the important village of Panagr?m; Prof. Morgenstier ne (61a) adds that it is very tempting to think of the Kuru-P?nc?las of the Indian Epics: the Kurus seem to have come after the other tribes, to be a later wave of the I.A. mi? grations; they are not mentioned as a people in the RV. (but a prince Kurusravana and a Kaur?yana are recorded). They occupy a great place in the Br?hmanas and in the Mah? bh?rata they are quoted as allied of the Daradas. Lal, 1943, p. 86. Uttarakurus settled beyond the Him?laya (parena Him?layam) are said to speak the finest language. There is a village Kuru on the road from Skardo to Kapalu in Baltistan. According to Curtius, Alexander after the events of Nysa entered the country of Dae dala. Thus, we are now in no part of the old seventh satrapy, but in a place independent of Gandh?ra of the Achaemenian list preserved in Herodotus; we are among the Daedala (61b), Dadikai, Dards (Junge 1941, p. 44).

Some Details in Curtius Ptolemaeus occupies some smaller towns, and Alexander the most important ones (Acadira and Arigaion). When this task was accomplished, Alexander rallied his troops that had been distributed in various directions, in view of the impending military opera? tions. Having crossed the river Choaspes, so Curtius says, he left Coenus to lay siege to a rich town called Beira (Bazira of Arrianus, now Barikot) while he proceded to Mazaga, whose King Assacanus died in battle; then the king's mother took his place and sur? rendered, presenting him with rich gifts and was recognized by Alexander as a queen. The Macedonian in so doing was ? More moved by her beauty than by a feeling of benevolence ?; anyhow, as the story goes, she bore him a son, and this son was called Alexander. All this seems a mixture of historical facts and romantic stories. But according to Diodorus XVIII, LXXXIV, ? the women of M?ssaga, when they realized that there was no hope of salvation for their men, took their weapons and went to fight ?. Notwithstanding his tendency to colour as a pleasant romance his stories, in certain cases, Curtius used, I think, practically to copy certain passages from works written by some chronicler well acquainted with the place, and a keen observer, as the following description of the fortifications of Massaga, gives evidence; its seems to be written by an expert in military architecture (VIII, ch. 37, XXXV): ? stadia murus urbis complectitur, cuius infe riora saxo, superiora crudo latere sunt structa. Lateri vinculum lapides sunt quas interpo suere, ut duriori materiae fragilis incumberet simulque terra humore diluta. Ne tarnen universa consideret, impositae erant trabes validae, quibus iniecta tabulata muros et tegebant et pervios fecerant ?. (? The city was besides surrounded by a wall 35 stadia in circumfe? rence, which had a basis of stone-work supporting a superstructure of unburnt, sundried bricks. The brickwork was bound into fabric by means of stones so interposed that the more brittle material rested upon the harder, while moist clay had been used for mortar. Lest, however, the structure should all at once sink, strong beams had been laid upon those, supporting wooden floors which covered the walls and afforded a passage among them?: transl. Mc Crindle in R. G. Majumdar 1960). This manner of building is still in use in many parts of the mountainous parts of Af? ghanistan, K?hist?n and the Pamirs. 28. Castles and Villages Towns were walled (sometimes double-walled) and built on top of steep hills (61b), where imposing traces of walls and buildings are still extant; just as Curtius writes, the basement is made of stone bricks, upon which mud walls were superimposed; the working people lived there and in the plains; tillers, labourers, silver- and goldsmiths, potters: in case of danger they might have taken shelter within the walls of the citadel. Naturally, what is now left on top of the hills is not protohistoric, except in a few cases; only parts of the old stone basements are preserved, because after the pax kushanica (61b) En petrais like in Bactria. 49</page><page sequence="42">(air photographs have revealed a big town of orthogonal plan near Ming?r a) urban centres along the main trade routes were largely abandoned; new invasions ravaged the country, and the population retired again on top of the hills, and rebuilt fortified villages on the remains of the old ones; there is a chain of high hills on the right side of the Sw?t opposite Ming?ra, overlooking the village of Aligr?ma and its cultivated land. On those hills there are heaps of ruins and the highest one was partially excavated by Dr. Faccenna. The up? per parts of those ruins go back to the time of the Hindu S?hi: when the excavations reached the rocky soil, fragments of the same pottery as that of the graveyards were dis? covered, and can still be found all along the slopes of the hill mixed with potsherds of the Kus?na period. Unfortunately, the name of the village is recent; it is now called Aligr?ma cthe village [gr?m) of Ali"5. If one day we discover the census of the Y?sufzai Sheikh Malli who conquered Sw?t (around the 16th century), distributed the lands enforc? ing a sound programme of rotation and ordered a census to be made, we might be in a condition to know the old name of the same village. We can say that houses, with pot? tery belonging to the various periods of Prof. Stacul's chronology, have been found at the bottom of the hill overlooking Aligr?ma and some of them very near to the river. Many things had changed from the times of Herodotus. The confederacy of the tribes under Assakanos gave its name to the country itself, Assakie, gravitating towards the K? phes; territorially, it corresponds roughly to Gandh?ra, its eastward limit is Puskal?vati; the Indus being the boundary between the two countries Assakie and India. The real Indians are beyond the Indus: no mention of the other peoples of the 7th Herodotean Satrapy except for the Daedalae, Dadikai. The war events relating to the in? vasion of Sw?t are introduced by Curtius VIII, X, 37 by the sentence; ? hinc (Nysa) ad regionem, quae Daedala vocatur perventum est ? which means that Alexander entered the Dardic country. Where then do the Sak? go situated north or east of Gandh?ra? (above, p. 16). Can it be definitely escluded from consideration that there is some relation with the Massagetae arid the Assaken?i, also called Massagenoi (62) after the name of their capital, and who were so powerful as to give their name to a large part of Gandh?ra (Assakie)? Is this too another hint at the migrations and intermingling of migrating tribes which pre? sumably took place in the regions of HinduKush, Pamir and northern Gandh?ra, during the times intercurrent between the last period of the reign of Darius and the expedition of Alexander? If what Curtius writes, i.e. that Alexander left Coenos to besiege Beira (Bazira, a rich town, urbs opulenta) and himself went to M?zaga (Massaka) and the Choaspes is Suv?stu, Sw?t, the doubt may arise that he crossed the river near Barikot in a place which we cannot identify and from there he reached the left bank of the Sw?t (63). There might be a reason for this, because Bazira had a great strategic importance since it controlled the routes to Buner (Kar?har pass): a reason which induced Alexander to fortify the city, as he wanted to prevent any attack by the troops of Abisares, requested to come to the rescue (62) Cf. above p. 42. (63) Also to-day there is a ford near Barikot. 50</page><page sequence="43">of the Assakenoi. I am giving rise to a doubt, I repeat, 1 am not solving a problem. The name of the capital of the Assakenoi: Massaga, Massaka, Mazaka, Masoga (Strabo XV 698) reminds me forcibly of the Massagetae (see references from classical sources in REy s.v. the Massagetae and the Scythians). Altheim and Stiehl 1970, p. 128 connect the name of the Massagetae with the Ossetic word m?sig, m?sug ctowerD, Marquart with av. masy? (exactly: masya, Bartholomae, p. 1155; Skr. matsya cfish3) (1905, p. 78). Among the Massagetae women enjoyed a great freedom and could be leaders in war; such was the case of Tomyris (or Tamyris) who took command of the Massagetae in the battle where Cyrus was killed. Concerning the queen of Massaga, Arrianus says only that after the death of Assac?nus his mother with his son surrendered. He does not add the name of this queen, but Curtius calls her Cleophis (gen. Cleophidis) a name which reminds us of some better-known names of the classi? cal tradition, e.g. Cleobis, etc. Curtius Rufus adds that she, accompanied by her son and many women of Massaga carrying golden gifts, went to the camp of the Macedonians and asked for mercy. She requested to be reinstated in her former position; Alexander consen? ted, inspired more by her beauty than by a feeling of compassion. According to Diodorus Siculus, the Scythian women, when their men died or were no longer able to fight, took their place in the battle. This was the behaviour of the wives of the mercenaries of Massaga whom Alexander allowed to leave the town and to join him; but they fled at the dead of night and when attacked by the Macedonians, women fought strenuously along with their men. According to Justinus and Trogus, Queen Cleophis lost her honour among her sub jects for having conceded herself to the enemy, and was iherefore called by the local people ? the harlot queen ?. Near Barikot, on a hill overlooking the Kandak valley, there are many ruins, the most important ones being those of a Buddhist settlement; nowadays, some ruins of a building nearby are locally called Kangar or Kancor Kot: (63a) the kot "of the shameless one", of the "harlot" or the procuress. It would be interesting if Mr Inayatur Rahman (Inayatur Rahman 1968) who has collected many folk tales of Sw?t (and some of them containing records, even if vague ones, of real old facts) could enquire of the local people about the origin of such a name and what kind of tradition, if any, is underlying it. After what I said above concerning the Saka Haumavarga I am even less inclined to abandon my former idea that there is a connection between the Massagetae and the Assakenoi, also called Massaken?i, from Massaga, I have also referred to some documents which indicate the presence of Scythians in the proximity of Gandh?ra; I have equally refer? red to some practices of the Assakenoi which are found among the Scythians, the most warlike tribe of the place. We know from Herodotus I 212, that the Massagetae worship? ped the sun (by which they used to swear as by their Lord) and that they used to sacrifice horses to it. The horse is not killed by any weapon, so that no drop of blood may be (63a) Stein A. MASI n. 42, 1930, p. 14. 51</page><page sequence="44">produced by the execution, but by means of a rope round the neck of the animal, slowly and gradually tightened with the help of a stick. A few facts can here be recollected; the possible documentation of sun worship by some of the peoples whose graveyards have been explored (p. 29 and p. 31), the burial of two horses near a tomb in Katelai, the proximity of Scythian tribes near Gandh?ra at the times of the Achaemenian empire, and also their probable descent towards Gandh?ra, see above, p. 16. We must also not forget what Strabo says: ? The Massagetae and Sa kas stood for the eastermost of the Scythians though each people per se bore a name of its own ? (XI 8, 2). V ?ornos 29. Aornos Unra sar or Ham I do not wish to appear as possessed by a mania for raising doubts; I only mean to say that to many a problem concerning Sw?t there might be alternative solutions. Let us consider e.g. the question of the Aornos. After the conquest of Ora the inhabitants of Bazira, discouraged, fled at the dead of night along with people of other tribes and took shelter in the petra, "the rock" which Arrianus calls Aornos (and Curtius Aornis) which is = Prakrit ?arana, a common name for any sheltered place (cf. also Pashai war cwalP) (64). Sir A. Stein (1927, p. 432) considers that the Ham was the place where the inhabi? tants of Barikot, Bazira (Vajirasth?na) took shelter when they fled from their town; but he thinks that the Aornos is not identical with the Ham, because he reads the passage of Ar? rianus in the following way: the people of Bazira ? lost heart and at the dead of night abandoned the town and fled to the rock. Thus the other barbarians, too, leaving their towns, they all fled to the rock in that country called Aornos ?. Arr., An.

But the most recent edition by Roos maintains the reading ? they fled to the rock ?; the following sentence adds that on hearing this, all the inhabitants of other towns fled to the petra (concerning which we cannot state with certainty that it is a different one from that of Barikot), which in the country is called "Aornos" (Curtius, Aornis). The Aornos has been identified by Sir Aurel Stein with Unra sar, Pir sar to the north (64) Altheim-Stiehl 1970, p. 166, derives ?ornos from a hu-varan which does not seem to me to be acceptable; ?varana is also in Skr. a fortified place. We find another ?ornos in Bactria: Arrianus, An. Ill 29, 1. 52</page><page sequence="45">of Chakresar, overlooking the Indus; we should remember that Alexander had already sent in advance Hephaistion and other generals to build a bridge at Udabh?nda (Ohind, Vahind, Und) where he would have met them. He soon went to Peukela?itis (Puskal?vati, Ch?r sadda) (passing through Orobatis, which Eggermont proposes to identify with Aristapura). Then, before proceeding to the ?ornos, he went to Emb?lima, now Ambela, in Buner; large supplies had been stocked there and everything else which might be requi? red; in order to prevent any attack from that side he decided to dislodge the enemy from the petra, the ?ornos, which according to Arrianus was very near to Emb?lima. Prof. Eggermont does not take too literally the statement that Emb?lima was a town near ?ornos, because the term "near" may be taken rather loosely and should be interpreted with some caution. I add that concerning the ?ornos (?ornis), Curtius writes (VIII 11): ? Multa ignobilia oppida deserta a suis venere in regis potestatem quorum incolae armati petram Aornis nomine occupaverunt ?; then he adds that ? Radices ejus Indus amnis subit ? (ibid.). In Justinus there is no mention of the ?ornos; he only writes: ? cum ad saxum rarae asperitatis et altitudinis, in quod multi populi confugerant pervenisset, cognoscit Hercu lem ab expugnatione ejusdem saxi terrae motu prohibitum ? (65); which refers to the legend of the unsuccessful expugnation of the Ham by Hercules. Arrianus (An. IV, 28, 1) does not mention the Indus. But Strabo does (XV, I, 8): ? When Alexander, at one assault took ?ornos, a rock at the foot of which the Indus river flows near its sources ?; "near its sources" is certainly an incorrect statement. The connection of Sindhu, Indus with the Daradas, and therefore the distinction between an upper (Darada) part and a lower Indian part is implicit: as it appears from the expres? sion D?radi Sindhuh, Prabh?va? ad P?nini IV 3, 83; Agrawala 1953, p. 43 (65a). The "petra" is so described by Curtius (VIII, XI 39): ? Petra non a modicis ac mol libus clivis in sublime fastigium crescit, sed in metae maxime modum erecta est, in cuius ima spatiosiora sunt, altiora in artius coeunt, summa in acutum cacumen exurgunt. Radices ejus Indus amnis subit (66) prealtus, utrimque asperis ripis; ab altera parte voragines eluviesque praeruptae sunt ?. Such indeed does the Ham appear from Barikot; Arrianus narrates that Alexander started from Emb?lima, encamped in a suitable place, and next day was at the bottom of the ?ornos. According to me, the time is too restricted for an army in full equipment and carrying war engines etc. to reach the Pir sar distant, as the crow flies, at least 60 miles with two passes, though not very high to cross, in a hilly tract. Then there is another reason which made me always uncertain about the identification of ?ornos with Pir sar; according to modern strategy this could be a magnificent fortress and afford large defensive power of artillery. The reason that gives rise to my doubts is not only that of the relative (65) On this legend which concerns Ham = Aornos see Tucci 1963., p. 171. (65a) Here d?radi indicates the place where the rivers was supposed to have its origin outside the borders of India. (66) Curtius and Strabo obviously draw here their information from the same source. 53</page><page sequence="46">distance between Emb?lima and the Pir sar, considering that more than 70 Km. in those parts cannot be taken as a short distance, but another one still. I am trying to think not in terms of modern strategy, but rather of the beliefs of those people who, when in diffi? culty, had recourse to their gods. What man cannot, the gods can do, and the Hilo moun? tain of the Chinese, the Ilo parvata of the Tibetans, the Ham of today, is a holy mountain, the seat of a god. Just in front of Barikot one can admire the peak of the Ham, abode of gods from the oldest times up to now. Arrianus followed by Justinus and Strabo (67) here introduces the story of Hercules who vainly tried to conquer it, thus praising Alexan? der as a human hero who had succeeded where a god had failed. This means that the moun? tain was, at that time, consecrated to a god and was even a place on which some legends or myths had been centred. And it has continued to be a holy place till our times. It was sacred during the Buddhist period when the pilgrims were shown the square stones like couches made by art [which] form an unbroken series of gulleys. It was here that the Buddha once, in a former birth, gave up his life for the hearing of a half "stanza of the Doc? trine". (Photo in Stein 1929, fig. 97). Those "square couches" might have been used as altars from prehistoric times (68); however, Ham has remained a holy place to the present day. Nowadays on the highest spot there is written on a rock the name of Sri R?m (R?ma, incarnation of Visnu). Hindus, Sikhs and even Muslims go there. When I reached the top, (and the last approach can be some what dangerous because one has to walk on a spur, overhanging the abyss), my guide, who was a very devout and orthodox Muslim, knelt down turning his face towards the qibla and recited the ritual prayers. The sacrality of the Ham goes back to prehistoric times, and has survived the changes of religions; the graveyards of Bazira have been dug in front of it. A little below there are a spring and some ponds. The difficulty of the ascent is marked by Stein 1929, pp. 168 ff. In ancient times, it was usual to take shelter in the sacred mountains which in ad? dition to the natural difficulties due to their asperities, were the abode of the gods, the ancestors, the tribal deities. Moreover, another fact must be taken into consideration: before attempting the ascent and the capture of the petra, Alexander ordered that Massaga, Or a, Bazira should be fortified, thus preventing any attack from the Kar?har pass, in order to be safe from that side, as he had done in Emb?lima. I do not see any serious objection to the identification of Emb?lima with the Ambela of today; phonetically also Ambela is nearer to Emb?lima than Amb. Moreover before attacking the petra Alexander left one of his generals at Emb?lima with army and supplies in case a siege might have taken place.

(68) That is most probably what remains of the old mountain worship of the early inhabitants of Sw?t. Were these stones used also by Alexan? der for his sacrifices, recorded by Arrianus?

Moreover from that side the ascent is easier (Stein, 1930, p. 102). Besides, if one wants to reach from Emb?lima the bottom of the petra one meets a small river, not certainly to be compared to the Indus, but a river all the same, (and the Indian interpreter might have used sindhuh in the sense of "river" as it is usual): the Buryonkanrai Khwar has its sources near the petra, the Ham itself, and runs into the Ba randu which flows into the Indus. Since Suv?stu is known in the Vedas, the opinion of Dahlquist 1962, that the Aor? nos may be identified with Aurnavabha (who, according to him, is the same as Vrtra, against whom Indra fought so as to let the waters free), cannot be ignored though Aur? navabha appears to be mainly a teacher. Be that as it may, the sacrality of Ham is very old, ab illo tempore-, so the story of Alexander recalled a local tradition, according to which a god or a demon identified by the Greek with Hercules, had vainly tried to conquer it. When the Assaken?i had been defeated, their territory, which probably included also that of their allies during the war, was put under the command of an Indian satrap, Sisi kottos (Sasigupta): Arrianus IV 30, 4; V 20, 7. When Alexander came back from Aornos he invaded ? according to Arrianus ? the land of the Assaken?i, that is, their other ter? ritories which had not yet been conquered, the remaining parts of Buner, and a consistent part of the lands of the confederation of tribes upon which the Assaken?i ruled; the people, however, had fled to the mountains. Nevertheless, Alexander met with some diffi? culties, because about 20,000 soldiers had been mustered there, by the brother of Assa canos, who might be the same as Erices, or Aphrikes of Trogus and Diodorus) (69) in order to harrass him on his way back (Curtius VIII 12, 1, 37). To sum up, besides the hypothesis: Unra sar = Aornos (70), the identification of Aornos with Ilam cannot a priori be excluded. Just a few words more about Dyrta: some? body (Agrawala 1953) proposed Dir, but I think that an expedition to Dir would have delayed and rendered more dangerous the plan devised by Alexander, who was anxious to reach India. Perhaps he might have pushed as far as Mingora and the J?mbil valley. But this too is a surmise. Eggermont 1975, p. 182 suggests that Dyrta (a name which he connects with that of the Dards) can be located in Buner, more precisely that it corresponds to modern Daggar: it is possible but, to my mind, Daggar would not fit a fortified town: better on the hills north-east of Daggar, Hissar Ghar. But further archaeological surveys in Buner are needed to clear this point. When Alexander had reached Peukel?oitis, Puskal?vatT, his campaign in Sw?t had come to an end. O See p. 15.

Apostles during Asoka's Times The missionaries of Asoka in their apostolic work went up to Afghanistan a few years after his conversion, and found on their way and there too, populations of different ethnic extraction and different languages or dialects. Many of them were considered to be outside the pale of Vedic tradition (see Manu quoted above) though always belong? ing to the Indo-Aryan group. Certainly the dialects which they spoke were dif? ferent from those of Central India. The Indians called the majority of these dialects pais?ci; now the name G?ndh?ri or N. W. dialects has taken its place (Bailey 1946, pp. 764 ff.; Brough 1962). Konow 1929, p. XCIV states that ? The North-Western Prakrit was itself at an early date used for literary purpose ? and also maintains that certain quotations from the Bud? dhist texts contained in the inscriptions of Wardak and Kurram show that such works were translated from a more eastern language which might have exercised ? a slight influence on the local vernaculars in written records. But the chief influence was exercised by the North Western Book Language itself ?. Of course, the G?ndh?ri was or was to become a kind of lingua franca, up to the boundaries of China, but it was subject to many local va? rieties which derive from the dialects spoken in the various regions in which it spread, from the N.W. frontier to Central Asia. Indian grammarians called these dialects pais?ci, so did also Grierson and we have some texts still preserved in this G?ndh?ri dialect of which the most important document is the Dharmapada; this text in some points already differs from that of Asoka's inscriptions in the N.W. The diaspora of Buddhism in the N.W. territories has been so clearly expounded by Lamotte that I can do no better than reproduce here what he has in a masterly way written on the subject (Lamotte 1958, pp. 366-369): Un autre indice de la penetration bouddhique est la localisation sur le sol du Nord-Ouest, et plus particulierement du Gandh?ra, de l'Uddiy?na et du Penjab occidental, de quantite de legendes emprun tees aux vies anterieures du Tath?gata. L'Inde gangetique avait ete le theatre de Texistence derniere du Buddha; le Nord-Ouest pretendit que ses vies anterieures s'etaient deroulees sur son sol. Chaque ville, chaque localite eut bient?t sa legende ? eile, et son st?pa pour la commemorer. A Nagarah?ra (Jel?l-?b?d), S?kyamuni avait recu la prediction du buddha Dipamkara, et etendu sa chevelure sous les pieds du Tath?gata. A Puskar?vatI (Sh?h-Dheri et Ch?rsadda), Sibi avait fait don de ses yeux ? un mendiant, et Sy?ma, alors qu'il cueillait des fruits pour ses parents aveugles, avait ete frappe par une fleche empoisonnee. A Varsapura (Sh?hb?zgarhi), Visvantara avait cede ? un br?hmane insatiable son elephant blanc, son royaume, son attelage, son epouse et ses enfants. A Sh?h-kot, le rsi Ekasrnga, seduit par une courtisane, l'avait ramenee en ville sur ses epaules. A Mangalapura (Manglaor), Ks?n tiv?din s'etait livre, sans une plainte, aux coups du roi Kali. Sur le mont Hi-lo ou Hidda (Ilam, sur la bordure du Sw?t et du B?ner), un jeune br?hmane s'etait precipite du haut d'un arbre pour avoir com? munication d'un verset de la Loi. Au Mah?vana (Sounigr?m), le roi Sarvada, voulant faire Paum?ne alors 56</page><page sequence="49">qu'il etait depourvu d'argent, s'etait livre ? prix d'or ? son ennemi. Au Masurasamgh?r?ma (Goumbatai, pres de Toursak dans le B?ner), Dharmarata avait transcrit un texte de la Loi en utilisant sa peau comme parchemin, un de ses os comme calame, et son sang en guise d'encre. A Gir?rai, le roi Sibi avait rachete, au poids de sa chair, un pigeon poursuivi par un faucon. Au monastere de Sarpausadhi dans la vallee du S?nir?ja (Adinzai), Indra, transforme un serpent, avait sauve la population de la famine et de la peste, tandis qu'un serpent industrieux faisait jaillir l'eau dun rocher... Les zeles propagandistes avaient done puise dans le riche repertoire des J?taka o? le Bodhisattva, sous une forme d'existence humaine, animale ou divine, avait pratique les grandes vertus de son etat, et notamment la generosite, la patience, l'energie et la sagesse, non sans tomber parfois ? comme ce fut le cas pour Ekasrnga ? dans d'inevitables faiblesses humaines. Avec Benares qui revendiquait egale ment siens quelques J?taka (l'filephant blanc ? six defenses, la Perdrix, le Cerf et le Lievre), le Gandh?ra fut le seul ? pratiquer le jeu ? un peu pueril, mais profitable pour les lieux de pelerinages ? de Paccli matation des legendes. Encore cet engouement n'eut-il qu'un temps. Le fait que des st?pa asokeens, comme celui du Don du corps sur le pic de Banj, du Don de la chair ? Gir?rai, du Don des yeux ? Ch?r sadda, du Don de la tete ? Taksasil?, de Visvantara ? Sh?hb?zgarhi, etc., furent edifies des l'epoque Maurya prouve que Fannexion des legendes debuta des l'introduction de la Bonne Loi dans les marches du Nord-Ouest... Notons pour terminer que la Bonne Loi ne connut pas le meme succes dans tous les districts du Nord-Ouest indistinetement. Les renseignements fournis par les pelerins chinois et les trouvailles archeologiques montrent que seuls les districts du Penjab occidental, du Gandh?ra, de l'Uddiy?na et sans doute aussi du J?guda (qui n'a pas encore ete explore systematiquement) furent veritablement bouddhises des l'epoque Maurya. II n'en fut pas de meme pour le Kapisa (Kohist?n de K?bul) o? Hiuan-tsang ne signale qu'un unique st?pa asokeen, ni meme pour le Kasmir o? Ton n'a retrouve aueune trace des fondations asokeennes du Suskaletra et du Vitastr?ta mentionnees par les voyageurs et Kalhana. Que quelques bouddhistes s'y soient aventures ? l'epoque ancienne, nul ne songe ? le nier; mais une hirondelle ne fait pas le printemps et, ? la lumiere des nombreux indices que nous aurons ? examiner plus loin, on peut croire que le Kapisa et le Kasmir ne devinrent de veritables fiefs boud dhiques qu'? l'epoque Kus?na, grace ? l'active propagande menee par Kaniska. C'est plus tard encore que la Bactriane, separee du bassin de l'Indus par la haute barriere de l'Hind?kush, devint ? son tour une terre sainte du bouddhisme. C'est ce qui ressort, entre autres indices, du temoignage de Hiuan-tsang qui attribue la plupart des fondations bouddhiques du Trans-Hind?kush, non pas ? Kaniska et moins encore ? Asoka, mais plus modestement et plus tardivement, ? des ? Anciens Rois ? (kieou wang), c'est ?-dire ? des Kus?na tardifs (c. 231-390 p.C), o? meme ? des Kid?rites (c. 390-460 p.C). E. Lamotte also adds: ? le succes sans precedent rencontre dans le milieu populaire par la litter a ture des J?takas et des avad?nas, avait grossi considerablement la legende boud dhique; chaque ville, chaque localite importante du Nord-Ouest etait representee dans le folklore religieux et pretendait avoir ete illustree autrefois par les exploits du futur Bud? dha, la visite de S?kyamuni ou la presence de quelque grand disciple ? (Lamotte 1947 1950, p. 159). But the first missionaries met, no doubt, with some difficulties in their work; first that of communicating with the people they choose to convert and then to select the texts more accessible to the eventual converts. They certainly did what the early apostles to China had done: they must have selected simple elementary books, which offered for consideration some outline of the life of the Buddha, and resorted to the j?takas and the avad?nas inculcating the inflexibility of the law of karma. This procedure had the advantage of condemning the practices that Buddhism prohibited and of expounding the main tenets of Buddhism, not in a dogmatical way, but in a narrative, easy discourse. We know that the Buddha did not enjoin to the apostles ? sent to evangelize the dif? ferent regions of India and later of Asia ? to teach and to preach in the same language he 57</page><page sequence="50">had himself spoken: each preacher was allowed to preach: sak?yanirut?y? "in his own dia? lect". This point too has been already elucidated by Prof. Lamotte 1958, p. 613; the Buddha authorized the use of the local dialects concerning the. pronunciation as well as the vocabularies. Thus, the Vimalaprabh? (a commentary on the K?lacakra), states that the Pitakas were written in 96 different languages. Such a question was debated also in the Vibh?s?s?tra where we find a very interesting passage translated for the first time by S. Levi ? The Buddha employs only one word for preaching his doctrine; then the people, each one according to his own category, understands it. Everybody says: the Bhagavat has spoken for me, it is only for me that he preaches this or that subject ?. This is what happened when he spoke to the T'o lo t'o, Ta la t'o, Daradas, to the Khasas (Chia sha), to the Mo lo p'o M?lava, etc. (See above, S. Levi 1905, 6, p. 286 ff.). In fact, as I have already said concerning our region, the Chinese have preserved the tradition that many books in Uddiy?na were written in pais?ci. It is therefore certain that the Indian missionaries, must have first of all learnt the local languages, and asked for the help or cooperation of some local learned man, conversant with other Indian dialects, probably merchants (71) as it every-where happened in the early times of the Buddhist diaspora. Though Uddiy?na later became inclined more towards Mah?y?na than to Hmay?na, old schools were represented there at the times of Fa hsien; Hsiian-tsang says that they had preserved some ancient Vinayas: Dharmagupta, Mahi s?saka, K?syapiya, Sarv?stiv?din, Mah?s?mghika (72). (Cf. Bareau 1955, p. 31; Lin 1949, pp. 208 ff.). We may safely assume that the missionary work in Sw?t coincides with the building of the big st?pa which has been excavated by the Italian archaeological mission (Faccenna 1964); the construction was most probably begun about the middle of the third century B.C. enclosing a nucleus housing the relics. This monument, consecrating the beginning of a Buddhist community in Sw?t, reminds us of the Greek-Aramaic inscription of Asoka found in Kandahar (tenth year of reign of Asoka since his consecration) (Pugliese Carratelli 1964) and of the other st?pas which Hsiian-tsang (see Lamotte quoted above) attributes to Asoka in Ghazni and J?guda. (71) Buddhism from the very beginning trav? elled along with caravans and traders. C2) Li Yen-shous* redaction (about 629 A.D.) of Pei-shih ch. 97, after having situ? ated geographically Uddiy?na, Wu-ch'ang, con? tains a very important information. The Hu Brahmins are said to be the higher class, great experts in astrology and in telling past and future events. This means that Hinduism was well alive with its class system, and the Brahmins were the privileged ones: the fact that they were experts in astrology and in foretelling future events or in recording past happenings shows that they are the foreunners of later Tantrism. Not less interesting is the name given to the leading class of the place; Hu: Hu is a name which was originally used for "barbarians", then for for? eigners of Central Asian and chiefly of Iranian origin or language. This shows that in the source from which the Pei-shih derives its infor? mation "language" refers to a "dialect mixed with Iranian words". Evidently such a definition is not exact, because though Iranian words can be found in Dardic, the author of the Pei-shih wants to say that they did not speak a language very much similar to Sanskrit or to m.i. Prakrit (Cf. also Wei-shih, ch. 97). On the meaning of Hu see: Pulleyblank 1951 p. 319. 58</page><page sequence="51">It was called, as we gather from an inscription in kharosthi on a pot (Petech 1966, p. 80), Dhammar?jika, a name attributed to the oldest (73) st?pas. But once we have established that the first translations were laid down in a language generally understood in those parts, and eventually, in the dialect spoken in certain re? gions, we should ask what happened to them. We have no document which may lead us to the conclusion that they were immediately put into writing, because we have no in? dication of the existence of any written literature in those parts. I therefore surmise that in the beginning these translations were mainly circulating orally. Later the life of Buddha, avad?nas and j?takas were made to converge into the archetype of a Vinaya, within the scheme of the udd?nas. We know that there exists a Vinaya of the Sarv?stiv?dins, and another one known as the Vinaya of the M?lasarv?dins "Vinaya of the original Sarv?stiv?dins". It is an enormous collection which at the times of its Chinese translator I tsing had become extremely rare, though it has constituted the source from which e.g. the Divy?vad?na has been extracted. Now, as shown by S. Levi, this work contains some texts which cannot be more recent than the third century A.D. (Asok?vad?na) or the S?rd?lakarn?vad?na to be dated at least at the beginning of the same century. All the Vinaya was put almost certainly into Sanskrit at the times of Kaniska: I say: at those times, not later, because the prophecy and the praises of Kaniska, the enlightened ruler who protected Buddhism, could persuade the king to bestow upon the Community major benefits if he or his immediate successor was alive. Then there are parts which show the interest of the redactors of the Vinaya in concocting the legend of a visit of the Buddha him? self to Kashmir, Chitr?l and Sw?t (74). Another legend concerns an apostolic visit to the N. W. regions of a prominent disciple of the Buddha, Mah?katy?yana. In an avad?na which, as we shall later show, is perhaps the elaboration and mixing up of two different stories, is described a rather anomalous journey of the holy man to a town Roruka (not yet located to a certainty) and then his return back to Sravasti. Both these narratives are very im? portant because they could have been elaborated nowhere else but in the N. W. regions. 31. The Sanghabhedavastu Portions of the Vinaya of MSV (75) were found in Gilgit, and published by S. Dutt. Some year ago I bought in Rawalpindi another bulky part of the same text (Sanghabheda (73) I shall deal with this subject: the meaning of Dharmar?jika in Oriental Notes V. In the excavations of Udegram the Greek name: Noy has been found inscribed on the fragment of a rim of a vessel: ? [belonging to] No?s?, as Pugliese Carratelli, 1966, p. 35 interprets it. The potsherd can be attributed to the Mauryan period. (74) The fact of there being two V may as, one of the Sarv?stiv?dins and another of the Msv, has been explained by Vinitadeva in his Vars?gra pariprcch?, by assuming that Sarv?stiv?din is the name of a number of groups and Msv. the name of one of them. (See Frauwallner 1936 p. 25 ff.). (75) On the Sarv?stiv?dins and M?lasarv?sti v?dins and their Vinaya see Bareau 1955, p. 154; Przyluski, 1923; Hofinger, 1946, pp. 235 411; Levi S., 1897; Lamotte, 1958; Banerjee, 1931; Frauwallner, 1959. 59</page><page sequence="52">vastu and of the Sayan?sanavastu) and I handed it over to the Archaeological Museum ol Karachi; I, then, was kindly allowed the loan of the MSS, on condition of its being restored and published. The book is now being edited by Prof. R. Gnoli; its first volume is out. This work written in good Sanskrit with a very few occasional instrusions of hybrid Bud? dhist Sanskrit contains some peculiarities e.g. the birth of the Buddha happening in a natural and not miraculous way). The revision and the translation into Sanskrit was made at the times of Kaniska; howe? ver, this does not preclude that in Sw?t and adjoining countries might have, for a long time, been circulating, in various forms, the primitive texts; according to Indian dia? lectology, they were in pais?ci, as is also confirmed by the Chinese (76). There have therefore been, I presume, different stages in the compilation of the huge corpus of the Vinaya MSV.; new insertions, abridgements in a word we have here a corpus in fieri in which such manipulations can be discovered as it happens also in a small text like the Dhammapada. It is natural, therefore, considering the various changes in the political events, the evolution of the dialects themselves, the increased interest in other texts of the dif? ferent collection of the Buddhist scriptures, the spreading of the apostolate in the neighbouring countries that the Vinaya suffered various changes. I shall not be astonished at all if we should discover one day precise testimonials A) of a primitive redaction in some Dardic dia? lect, B) then an adaptation in G?ndh?ri, with new manipulations and variations, C) other sections of the Sanskrit translation now partly discovered. The Sanskrit translation is the last setting up of different elements put together after a long elaboration following the sequence of the udd?nas, a real indexing in which the names are enumerated of the persons, deities, goblins, that are dealt with in the following chapters, in order to testify to the origin of certain Vinaya prescriptions explained and formalized by the Buddha in his present or in his previous births, and chiefly the inevi? table Law of karma. But it happens that in some cases in the prose section (7T) the sto? ries deal with subjects other than those enunciated in the udd?na, or that some stories an? nounced in the udd?nas are not found in the prose section; all this evidently implies a work of revision: the arrangement of the subject matter has also been occasionally modified. The udd?nas represent not only, as I said, the nucleus and the sequence of the avadanas told by the Dharmabh?nakas but certainly they were used as well as the scheme which inspired the artists in their plastic evocation and representation of the various events of the Bodhisattvaas previous achievements or of the life of the Buddha himself which are the subject treated by Gandharan art. The persistence of the NW texts whether of the MSV or of others was such that ? the extant Buddhist literature of Khotan has been translated from Buddhist Sanskrit, but the technical terms of the religion which became a living part of the Khotanese language were not from Sanskrit but from the Nor? thern Western Prakrit such as was also written in Krorayina ?, Bailey 1961, p. 14. (76) Also in the opinion of Bareau 1955, p. 154 the Vinaya of the MSV, seems to present a character more archaic than that of the SV and also of most of the other Vinayapitakas. (77) The term is inappropriate because many prose chapters contains also metrical portions. 60</page><page sequence="53">32. Legends on the travels of Buddha and his disciples to the N. W. Then as soon as Buddhism spread, the local communities certainly stimulated by the waves of new missionaries imagined and began to tell people to convert and pilgrims that Buddha had blessed Sw?t with his own presence and left evident traces of it. Thus the foot-prints with Karosthi inscription were considered as the undeniable testimony of the truth of this tale. He had left them for the spiritual elevation of the pilgrims (Konow 1929, p. 1; Tucci 1958, fig. 8). And the local monks could also show to the pilgrims the rock on which he had laid to dry in the sun his robes, wet after the contest for the submission of Apal?la. In Darel, the first capital of Sw?t according to the local tradition (79), or pos? sibly capital for a certain time of Sw?t, the image of Maitreya, about which many adventures and air travels are narrated, has certainly its importance on the expansion of Buddhism in those parts. In Darel was a famous wooden image of Maitreya (80 ft. high). According to the tradition its sculptor had ascended to heaven (according to some sources, he was an arhat) in order to be perfectly sure that his work corresponded exactly to the original. Other pilgrims who saw the image are quoted by P. Demieville 1954, p. 379 and n. 4. As for Darel, the name itself contains the name of the ethnic group of the Dards. Without insisting on the visit by the Buddha himself (80), I shall add a few words on the story of king Ud?yana, Udr?yana (81) (Tib. U-tra ya na) who was con? verted to Buddhism by Mah?k?ty?yana; Udayana, Udr?yana was the ruler of Roruka, Rau raka, and Mah?k?ty?yana was sent to him by king Bimbis?ra. The arhat took with him five hundred monks, and the nun Sail? followed him with five hundred nuns. The king was converted, went to R?jagrha, entered the order, and met king Bimbis?ra. Before leav? ing Roruka he had appointed as king his son Sikhandin who, under the influence of two perfidious ministers, persecuted Buddhism and went so far as to send some killers to mur? der his father who, meanwhile, had attained arhatship. Thus having committed parricide and being the murderer of an arhat, he was as a consequence bound, after his death, to fall in the depth of the Avici hell. Accepting the advice of the two bad ministers, Sikhan? din persecuted all the Buddhists, who therefore left the town with the exception of Mah?k?? ty?yana and Sail?. One day, Sikhandin met Mah?k?ty?yana and saw that the arhat imme? diately turned away from him, fearing that he might be contaminated by the encounter with a parricide. The king was so angry that he ordered his own people to throw upon the holy man handfuls of earth, until he was completely smothered by it; but that heap of earth turned into a hut.

(81) On this fricative spelling see above p. 39. 61</page><page sequence="54">Some shepherds reported the event to the two good ministers of Udr?yana; Heruka and Bhiruka (82), and these set free the Arhat; the latter requested them to leave the town, because in seven days' time it would be buried under a sand-storm. Thus they did, but, before leaving, Heruka handed over his son Sy?m?ka to Mah?k?ty?yana, and Bhiruka requested the nun Sail? to take his daughter Sy?m?vatI to his relative Ghosila in Kaus?mbi. Then Mah?k?ty?yana leaves the town buried by the sand, followed by the goddess pa? tron of the town. In his travel Mah?k?ty?yana reaches Kharavana (the donkey forest); then he proceeds to Lambaka, Lamp?ka, Laghman (83) and thence to Sy?m?ka (Chinese She mi) so named because the young Sy?m?ka, the son of Heruka, was elected king of that place since the local king had died. This is not the end of the journey, because Mah?k?ty?yana goes to Vokk?na, Wakh?n his native country, in order to convert his mother (84). A st?pa was built and upon it the arhat fixed his stick; this is the reason why the st?pa is called the "st?pa of the stick". Then from here he reaches Sr?vasti. In the Chinese translation of I-tsing the mention of Kharavana is missing and there is no trace of the country Sy?? m?ka, but of a "little country"; the same translation adds that on the way back from Vokk?na, Wakh?n, he had to cros "a snow pass" and that the local gods of the northern regions requested him to give them a souvenir of his passage. He gave them a leather shoe upon which a st?pa was built; then he reached the Oxus, and thence he returned to Sravasti. As regards the two ministers, they dug a canal up to the river Sindhu. In a certain place Heruka founded a town called Herukaccha and Bhiruka founded another one, Bhirukaccha. The 'Romkz-avad?na has been the object of many researches; from those of Sylvain Levi, T'oung-pao, 2nd Series, Vol. 3, 1907 p. 105 to those of Watters ad Hs?an tsang II, 287, H?ber 1906, p. 335, L?ders 1940, p. 641, Lulius Van Goor, quoted in J. Nobel 1955 and recently of Eggermont 1975. It has been argued that Roruka is not in Central Asia (Ho lao lo kia). Now it is generally admitted that Roruka was the Capital of the Sauvira, Sindhu-Sauvlra, near the delta of the Indus, approximately comprising the lower part of Baluchistan and Makram (85). But let us not forget that the Avad?na of Ud?yana, Udr?yana is a part of an ancient Vinaya of the M?lasarv?stiv?dins (see above p. 59) which in my opinion, was composed, originally at least, in some parts of the N.W. (82) In the Mah?m?y?ri, 17, Bhiruka and Bha ruka. (83) On Laghman, Lamghan etc. (84) Mah?k?ty?yana in the P?li canon is cel? ebrated as one of the most conspicuous disciples of the Buddha, but nowhere is there a record of his connection with the North or with the Sauvira. Many differences are also traceable be? tween the Divy?vad?na and the translation of I-tsing. Nobel J. 1955, introduction. (85) Eggermont, 1976, pp. 147 ff. But it must be noted that Hemacandra in his Abhidh?nacint?mani IV, 22-27, places the Sau viras after the Lamp?kas, adding Lamp?kas, Mu rundas syuh: he defines them as Kum?lak?h = kum = prthivim malayanti, kum?lak?h; on the other hand, Vinayacandra (quoted by the editors of the K?vyamtm?ms? of R?jasekhara (p. 248) in his K?vyasiks? ? at present not accessible to me ? places the Sauvira in the Uttar?p?tha near the Ausir?h and V?k?na, Wakh?n. If other sources (and there are), come to support the latter location, the problem of Roruka should be taken up again. So also Brhatsamhit?

The two ministers moved southwards, sailed on a river (Sindhu) and founded Bhirukac cha, Broach (in Kathiawar) and Herukaccha, identified by Eggermont with Barbaricum of the classical authors. But it might as well be Bambhore (Sindhi) whose excavations were undertaken SW. of Tatta in the mouth of an old channel of the Indus about 60 miles north of Karachi and where the imposing remains of a fortified harbour have been found (86). The oldest layers of these ruins so far excavated go back to the Parthian period. The itine? rary of the two ministers is of no interest to us at present. They represent a separate sec? tion of the avad?na, which after the identification of Roruka with the capital of the Sau vira, is contradictory, because the two of them navigated on a river downstream, from north to south. They did not go with Mah?k?ty?yana; they went southwards, while from Ro? ruka the latter moved northwards. We must therefore admit that the equation Roruka Sauvira cannot be maintained if the story of Mah?k?ty?yana and that of the ministers belong to the same avad?na. Indeed, no connection can be found between the two itine? raries: that of Mah?k?ty?yana and that of Heruka and Bhiruka. The itinerary first led the arhat to Lamp?ka; accompanied, by Sy?m?ka, he went to Laghman, where Sy?m?ka, who flew in the air, held on to the dress of K?ty?yana. When the local people saw him flying in that manner, they said: "Lambate, lambate,he hangs down"; this was the origin of the name of Lamb?ka, Lamp?ka (also Lank?). All this means that the local Buddhists wanted to connect the origin of their name with a marvellous event, which could warrant the anti? quity of their communities, though the radical of Lamp?ka is Dardic; pasai: lam. Mah?k?ty?yana went to Sy?m?ka (She-mi in Chinese; it corresponds to Chitr?l), then to Wakh?n (87). The itinerary he followed is certainly not the shortest way to reach Sr?vasti. It is rather the story of the apostolic mission sent to the N.W. provinces. The story supposes that when it was introduced in the Vinaya of MSV, Buddhism had already penetrated in Chitr?l, if Sy?m?ka ? a fervent Buddhist ? was offered the kingship of the country; if She-mi corresponds, as it seems certain, to Chitr?l, She-mi is connected with Sy?m?ka which meant that Sy?m?ka was considered the eponym of the country. Hui-ch'ao (Fuchs (85a) A place in the North mentioned by the Candragarbhas?tra near the Urasa and Daradas there is K!ia lo p'o lo: Levi 1905b p. 283 pro? poses Kharavara; shall we think that there is a mistake in the Chinese transcription? p'o lo for: p'o na ?

Here is repeated the same pattern of the learned etymology of the name of Lamp?ka. Thus, this section of the avad?na seems to belong to a set of Mah?tmyas, eulogies, meant to connect those N.W. regions with the very beginning of Buddhism. We can draw no conclusions from the name of Kapphina (89) (Mah?kappina in P?li), because from his story we can only infer that he was born, see Malasekera s.v., in a frontier town, called Kukkutavatl, of which he was the king; his wife had been Anoj? from S?gala (S?kala, Sialkot) in the Madda (Madra) country; then, in order to meet the Buddha and to take his vows from him, he left his country and met the master near the Candrabh?g? (Chenab). The same story with some variants in the Dhammapada's commentary (Burlingame, 1921, p. 101). On the other hand, according to the Sanskrit version of the Avad?nasataka, Kapphina was a king of Daksin?patha. He wanted to subdue six kings, that of Sr?vasti etc.; then those kings went to see the Buddha asking him for his advice; Kapphina paid a visit to the Buddha who performed some miracles. Kapphina was converted, became a srot?panna and, later, an arhat. In the first case, he might have come from the border of Kashmir and neighbouring countries (he crossed the Chandrabh?g?, Chenab); in the second, from South India. On Kapphina there is a fine poem written by the Kashmiri poet Sivasv?min (Kapphin?kyudaya ed. Gauri Shankar, Lahore 1937). According to SivasV?min the capital of Kapphina was Lil?vati on the Narmada in the Vindhy? region; among the kings with whom he had relations, Sivasv?min mentions: ?smaka, Nis?da, Sivi, Sauviravarna, Ruru, Madraka. The only conclusion that we can draw from all these references is that there were two centres in which the legend of Mah?kapphina was elaborated: one in the South, more vague and implying great geographical difficulties concerning the itinerary followed by the king from the South to Sr?vasti; as to the second one, if we follow the P?li tradition, his birthplace could be located in Madradesa, capital S?kala, today Sialkot. The final syllable of his name: na is found in the Onomasticon of South India, S?yana, Bukkana etc. in Kashmir: Kalkana etc. When the story of the travels of the Buddha in the N.W. and of the journey of Mah?? k?ty?yana or Madhy?ntika were introduced, Buddhism was at the height of its fortunes in those parts. Then communities did no longer appreciate the fact that in the diaspora of Buddhism they could not vie with the parts of India where the Buddha had lived, prea? ched, trasmitted the Law to his pupils, and had died. They wanted to create a nobility for themselves, to have been honoured by a visit of the Buddha himself and of some of his most famous disciples; their intention was to cancel the impression that they had been new-comers to the faith: and they found a visible document of all this in the footprints at Tirh?t and such like relics. (88) Cf. the name of Shamelai, a ridge above Mingora in Sw?t. (The story is at the same time an eulogium of the Country and of the royal family. For such examples of the name of a king instead of that of the people alone cf. Brhatsamhit?, above p. 33, note 37; p. 62, note 85. (89) See Petech 1950 pp. 66-67. 64</page><page sequence="57">33. Uddiy?na Script According to the "Life of Hs?an-tsang", Uddiy?na (89a) is taken in the meaning of "garden" (udy?na); in it there was the park of the king Cakravartin, evidently Asoka. As regards the language spoken in Sw?t Fa-hsien writes that it was that of Central India. A mista? ke probably due to the fact that he used to meet chiefly monks or people coming from the plains; Hs?an-tsang, on the contrary, makes two very important statements a) that their language was different, but similar to a certain extent to that of India and b) that the "rules of their written language was in a rather unsettled state" (Watters 1904 I p. 225). The translation of Watters is here not exact. Similarly that of Beal: "Their written characters and their rules of etiquette are also of a mixed character as before" (Beal p. 120) I would propose "their writing and their eti? quette have to some extent scarse conformity with those of India". That the language was different from the main dialects of India, but the same as that of Chitr?l that is to say Dardic (as it is also now from B?rhein northwards) is testified by Hui-ch'ao travelling in 726. As regards the scripture the statement on the peculiarity of the alphabet of Sw?t is confirmed by what we read in the Lalitavistara; this book enumerating the lipis (mode of writing) known by the young Bodhisattva, quotes first of all the Darada lipi, the Dardic scripture, followed by the Kh?syalipi (89b) and the Cina lipi (Tucci 1971). All this is confirmed by the Tibetan tradition; some gter ma (books hidden at the time of Padmasambhava) were written in the characters and in the language of Orgyan = = Uddiy?na, but then the tradition survived and so-called examples of the Uddiy?na language and lipis are found as titles of some Bon po or rNin ma pa books. There is also a booklet printed in Tibet which reproduces the lipis of many countries and among them there is that of Uddiy?na. We cannot assuredly rely on it and affirm that it has faithfully reproduced the original characters used in former times in Sw?t: what is important for us is that the tradition never died out, That the languages of Sw?t and Chitr?l (Dardic) were identical is confirmed also by Hui-ch'ao (726) who adds that the people of Sw?t and Chitr?l not only spoke the same language, but also wore the same dress. It is not perhaps out of place to recall some coins (both in copper and in silver) of the last Hindu S?hi King of Udabh?nda and Gandh?ra which are very common in Af? ghanistan and in the NW. frontier, including Sw?t. Those minted under the rule of Spa dapati-deva (and, on that pattern, of some other rulers) bear on the obverse the image of (89a) The first ones to find out that the real name of Sw?t was not Udy?na but Uddiy?na were F.W. Thomas JRAS 1905, p. 461, and S. Levi Mm. J.A. 1915, p. 103 ff. See also Tucci, 1949. (89b) Cf. Shiratori K. 1957. The Khasas are well-known, according to the Pur?nas, as mountain tribe parvat?srayinah; they are listed with the Cinas among the peoples of the Pamirs (Levi S. 1918, 118). They are the same as the Kakkha of Kashmir. Some tribes of them about the 10th-11th centuries migrated eastwards, and conquered a great part of Western Tibet and Western Nepal, as I think to have shown in Tucci 1956b. About them, and the correspondence between Khasa and Kashmiri Kakha see Stein 1961, vol. I, 47 note to I, 317. See below. 65</page><page sequence="58">a king with a spear; there is on it an inscription which has been a puzzle for a long time and then has been read by Ghirshman, 1948, p. 40, n. 1 (and with some corrections by Macdowall 1968, p. 192): 2qi EjiaXcwtuti. Such coins recall to my mind some inscriptions of the Museum of Lahore which are labelled "inscriptions in unknown language and alphabet". Those inscriptions were chiefly collected by Major Deane who was not an expert, but inflamed by a great enthusiasm; he used to pay for any inscription brought to him. This liberality may have aroused the greed of some clever clerk, inducing him to submit to the Major some fakes of his own fabrication: but the clerk must have started from some basic document, leaving to his fantasy new modulations. When I saw the inscriptions I had the impression that there is a certain variety among them. I took some rubbings, which are now under examination. Inscriptions in what is called Tocharian (or late Kus?na) are known from Tochi along with another bilingual inscription in Arabic and Sanskrit published by Harmatta 1966, I, p. 449 ff.; 1969, p. 208; Humbach, Dani, Goebl, 1964 (90). Mukherjee 1973, pp. 56 f.f. When the news of the discovery of these inscriptions reached the orientalists they roused a great interest; they took them all for good ones (90a); the general view was that they should have been connected with the Turkish rulers of Afghanistan. I am very sceptical about this solution, I hope that the comparison of them with the mason marks written on the back of many architectural pieces found in Butkara may give some useful hint to the solution of the problem. They will be the object of another article [Oriental Notes, V). In such a note the mason marks will be alphabetically arranged (as they are written on the stone); any deviation from the usual ductus will be reproduced, side by side, in order to facilitate the comparison. Photo of the inscriptions not yet deciphered and scat? tered in different museums of Pakistan will also be published. (90) Deane H.A. Note on Udy?na and Gan dh?ra. JRAS 1896. On the inscriptions found in Sw?t by Col. Deane, see Senart 1894 p. 333, S. LEvi-Ed. Cha vannes, 1895, pp. 341 ff. The latter authors seem inclined to accept the thesis of V. Thomsen (Bulletin Acad. Roy ale Sciences et Lettres de Danemark, 1893, pp. 285-299, Memoires de la Societe Finno-Ougrienne V. fasc. 1894) who finds that more than twelve characters are similar to some letters of the Orkhon inscriptions. At that time prince Kiil-Teghin who died in 731 was the ruler of Afghanistan; I am afraid that such a hypothesis can hardly be endorsed. (90a) Now see the inscriptions found in Afgha? nistan, Fussman BEFEO 1974 p. 8. Nor should we forget the inscription published by me in E.W. vol. 20, 1970, p. 104 after the reading of Prof. Raniero Gnoli: it refers to a king Vijayap?ladeva and mentions the construc? tion of a math a in Marmalika. The most im? portant information which it supplies is that the king was kir?ta-paks?bhimukha, ?siding with the Kir?ta ?. Kir?ta as known indicates tribes of hunters or marauders, warriors outside the pale of orthodoxy. They are not only located in the East but chiefly in West and North West along with the Daradas, Kambojas, Qnas, Sakas, Yavanas etc. Manu X, 44. Sometimes they are said to be degenerated Ksatriya. Considering the possible datation of the inscription 8th-9th century, one may think of the Tibetans or of the Arab con? quests by Fa dal b. Sahal 814-815 who subdued the Kabul Shah, and went up to Tibet and Bolor (Ghafur, A.P. 1955-66, p. 6 ft. On the Kir?tas. Ronnow, Monde Oriental vol. XXX, S.K. Chatterjee J.A.S.B. 1951. I hope to come back to this inscription in a future note. 66</page><page sequence="59">One point seems certain to me i.e. that according to Hsiian-tsang the alphabet of Sw?t is not completely different (nor was the language) from that used in India but scar? cely conform to it; therefore we may perhaps exclude the cursive Greek alphabet used by the late Kus?na or the Ephtalites (90b); we must understand his words as if Hsiian-tsang wanted to say that such an alphabet contained certain peculiarities not to be found in the Indian scripture: if it had been completely different as it was in J?guda, he would cer? tainly have said it, as he did when speaking of J?guda (Watters 1904-5 II, p. 284). It is more probable that it contained variations of Kharosthi, as D III of Fussman. A solution may be proposed, I insist, after the reading of all the mason marks of Sw?t. VII Historical problems 34. The decay of Buddhism It is not easy to explain the decrease of monasteries after Fa-hsien (399-414 A.D.) (1400 monasteries) and the fact that at the times of Hsiian-tsang (he travels from 629 to 645) many of them were in ruins, and monks were no longer interested in study and medita? tion but specially inclined to Tantric practices. Sung Y?n (he travels from 518-523) speaks in high terms of the Buddhist community and does not anticipate the different state? ments of Hsiian-tsang. 1400 monasteries imply not only a widespread devotion, but also great wealth necessary for their maintenance. Most probably Sw?t (or its petty chiefs) had been a tributary of the Kus?na: nevertheless under the Kus?na period Uddiy?na reached the apex of its culture and wealth (91); the best testi? monials of such a welfare are the st?pas, the monasteries then built, the ability of the craftsmen and artists, masons and sculptors, or the learning of his monks too: famous monks and artisans were invited to China. There were also in Sw?t occasional local mints (91a). The Sasanians had passed there before Sung Y?n, and perhaps took control of Sw?t for a certain period; the Ephtalites followed and might have caused other damages (91b); Bud? dhism was still prosperous at the times of Sung Y?n; something had, then, happened bet? ween the visit of Sung Y?n and that of Hs?an-tsang. I suppose the cause may be attri (90b) jn J?guda inscriptions in cursive Greek have been found. (91) The Pei-sbih ch. 97 confirms the pros? perous economical conditions of the country, the forests, the cultivation of fruits, the irrigation of the fields, the production of rice and wheat. The people are devoted to the Buddha; there are many gorgeous temples and st?pas. (91a) In case of shortage, subsidiary coinage was occasionally tolerated. G?bl, 1976. (91b) I believe that the ravages attributed to the Ephtalites have been somehow exaggerated. Another problem to be deeply investigated. 67</page><page sequence="60">buted to natural calamities and social unrest: earthquakes and floods documented by the excavations, at Butkara and elsewhere, greatly impoverished the country, then the decrease of trade with the plains and with Central Asia, via Gilgit, the probable attempts by the Turki S?his to control Sw?t, a fact which was realized in the year 747, the division of the country among different petty vassals chiefs. In spite of his praises for the piety of the Sw?ti monks, their inborn inclination to magic is confirmed also by Sung Yiin; but it had increased at the time of Hs?an-tsang, who, as I said, does not seem to have a high opinion of the monks of Uddiy?na. Sung Y?n speaks of their austerity. But their inborn inclination to magic was well-known long since in Tashkurgan (Han - p'an - t'o); when a brahman was killed by a n?ga, whose abode was in a lake on the border of which the brahman was resting, the king left his kingdom into the hands of his son and went to Uddiy?na in order to learn magic incanta? tions. (Sung Y?n, p. 399). Down to the later general decay of Buddhism, except for the unique image of a goddess (Tucci, 1963, p. 307 fg. 26) and even an image of Siva, there are not many traces of a great diffusion of Hinduism in Sw?t (92), a fact confirmed by the Chinese tra? vellers; Hs?an-tsang speaks of ten Deva (Hindu) temples (93), but a very important Saiva school, the Kramasamprad?ya, was originated or had some of its most famous authors in Sw?t (Tucci 1963, p. 283). It is to be noted that one of the first revealers of this school was Khagendra "the lord of those flying in the air", the Saiva match of the D?ka, mascu? line form of the D?kinis (94). 35. Diffusion of Vajray?na, and revival of aboriginal cults The country seems to be then dominated by Vajray?na, opening the way to the revival of the aboriginal, cruel presences and of the magic rituals for which Sw?t had been famous from its origin. Traditional Buddhism in the end could not satisfy the aspirations of the people any more; the Guhyasam?ja-tantra is attributed to Indrabh?ti, king of Sw?t; many Tantric books were recovered ? so the tradition goes ? by Vajrap?ni who handed them over to the N?gas; Indrabh?ti wrote them down, changing the N?gas either in "heroes" dpa' bo (vira) (95) or in flying entities mk'a' agro ma, d?kirii (Tucci 1949, I, 121, 212). (92) In the inscription of Varamabhatt?raka mah?r?j?dhir?j? paramesvara sri Jayadevap?la found at Barikot, mention is made of some foundation (temple, statue ?), but the inscription is so badly damaged that we cannot say whether it refers to some Buddhist or Saiva monument. I am inclined to accept the latter view. Among the statues found in Butkara there is none which recalls Tantric iconography, with the exception of the fragment of a door-jamb that represents a deity with six arms; but it belongs to the lst-2nd century A.D. and, as shown by Prof. Taddei, it has been most probably inspired by Palmirean iconographic models. Taddei, EW, XV, pp. 174-8. (93) But see Pei shih quoted above p. 58 note 72. (94) This shows that the rulers were equally tolerant towards Buddhism and Hinduism. (95) On the dPa' bo see Berglie Arne, Pre? liminary remarks on some Tibetan ?spirit me? dium ? in Nepal. Kailash, vol. IV, 1976, n. 1, p. 85. 68</page><page sequence="61">Uddiy?na was therefore considered one of the most famous Tan trie places in India; It is one of the pithas, holy centres of Tantrism, the Uddiy?napitha and it turned into a kind of Mecca for the Tibetans, as the birthplace of Padmasambhava, and the home of the d?kinis (96) (in Tibetan: mk'q' agro ma "sky-flying"). Though possessing great powers they are said to be, as a rule, the retinue of most important gods. They are ambivalent, good or mischievous, according as they are suitably worshipped or offended. The monks, assailed by the same impact of the aboriginal beliefs and practices, embraced Vajray?na; in it the old aboriginal, sometimes humble village deities, were accepted as symbols of some esoteric truths of Vajray?na; erotism penetrated into it. Each god embracing his own pa redra, ancient godlings of which we often find the parallel in the religious tradition of the K?firs, in the popular religion of Tibet (Tucci 1970, p. 230), among the Shinas, in Dardistan ? though not escaping the influence of some Buddhist implication ? made once more of Sw?t the country of the fairies, the witches, and the wizards that are still surviving under different names as far as Gilgit (the ambiguous Peri, and Daiy?l). The ill-disposed d?kini became the ? flying Rui ? (96a), capable of hurting men at the dead of night. They leave their bed, not with their material body, but with their ? subtle ? or astral body, and fly capri? ciously; many of them may be very dangerous to any one who meets them. I assisted to a trance of one of these Ruis and Hapidei which I described elsewhere (Tucci 1973, p. 155 note). We could also go further. Our knowledge of the folk religion of the K?firs and some of their neighbours untouch? ed by Buddhism, or having had scarce contacts with Buddhism, makes me believe that the fairies, the Peri and the Daiy?l are not a survival of the D?kinis, or of the D?kas; they are rather the same primeval religious entities, the ambiguous powers chiefly, but not only, female whom Buddhism accepted in its Tantric esoterism as d?kinis; Vajray?na codified them within the frame of the Buddhist gnosis and when it disappeared, then their resurrection took place. They were, in fact, so deeply rooted since times immemorial in the mind of the people that not even sunnite Islam succeeded in eliminating them: they survived in the Ruis or the Hapideis or the Daiy?ls and in the more dignified but equally ambiguous Peris (97). 36. Sw?t a place of pilgrimage for Tibetans In spite of this situation well documented by literary tradition it is a fact that during the excavation no image or symbol belonging to Vajray?na schools has so far been discove? red in Sw?t. In the 10th century Sw?t was plundered by Mahmud of Ghazni and then by his sue (96) D?kini, according to Tantric schools, from the root: dai, to fly.

But its fame as a sacred place induced some Tibetan pilgrims to a long and dangerous voyage. It was the attraction of meeting the d?kiriis that persuaded a Tibetan siddha of the 13th century (and others after him) to leave his country and to undertake a perilous journey to Sw?t. The Tibetan S?dhu, Orgyan pa (1230-1293) says that he met a Yogini and accepted some water from her; then the earth began to quake; he states that the most important d?kiriis of Uddiy?na were Soni, Gasuri, Matangi, Tasasi and adds that Son! corresponds to the dukirii that in Tibet is known as aGro bzan. The women of Orgyan know "how to turn themselves by magical art into any form they want; they like flesh and blood, and have the power to deprive every creature of its vitality and its strenght". (Tucci 1971b, p. 398). Just what is said also today of some Ruis. Relating the story of L?vap?, (Kambala-p?), the Tibetan pilgrim writes that, by his magic power, that ascetic had changed all women into sheep; he was then requested by the male population to let the women assume their for? mer aspect: he accepted, provided they promised to adopt a different attire; women should wear their shoes upon their head (98), insert a ring in the nose, use a girdle in the shape of a snake (Tucci 1971b, p. 399). Is that a remembrance of the fact that the new? comers, Turki or other peoples, forced the women folk to change their way of dressing? The centre of Orgyan was, at that time, Dhu ma t'a la (cf. the greatest Buddhist settlement of Uddiy?na called by the Chinese T'a lo, T'o lo (see p. 19, note 19). At the time of Orgyan pa, Sw?t was under the Hor, literally Mongols, but with such a term Orgyan pa indicates also the Muslims. While at the time of Orgyan pa it seem that small Buddhist or Hindu islands still survived, all traces of them had disappeared at the times of sTag Ts'an ras pa (first half of the seventeenth century). During the invasions by the Ghaznavides and their successors many inhabitants of Sw?t fled to Hazara (so the tradition goes); others were converted to Islam. 37. Sw?t and Gil git When things began to be worse and the country continued to grow impover? ished, under the threat of the Arab and then of the Tibetan incursions, the village magician and the belief in fairies and witches took the upperhand; it seems likely that some monks left Sw?t, went away and took shelter in other places which afforded better prospects or commodities. Gilgit was near: they might have gone there and also farther, to Central Asia, to Kashmir, to China, to Baltistan, where Buddhists had since long penetrated and people, according to Hui-ch'ao, were prevalently Buddhist. Gilgit was one of the doors which opened to Sw?t the Northern routes. It had already (98) Some head-covers and ornaments of K?firi women may appear with some imagination as having the shape of an inverted shoe. 70</page><page sequence="63">accepted Buddhism. Manuscripts of the 6th-8th centuries have been discovered (") there; I refer chiefly to those which were saved by Sir Aurel Stein, a very important part of a perhaps complete Tripitaka hidden in a st?pa, which local people had demolished. Prof. N.P. Chakravarti studied the paleography of the colophon of a fragment of the Vajracchedik? discovered along with the Sanghabhedavastu and published in: Tucci 1956a p. 175 ff., and he came to the conclusion that it was written in 5th century A.D. Not all the manuscripts found in Gilgit belong to the same age: they go from the 6th up to the 8th century A.D. In the colophons of some MSS. there are written the names of a king and of the donors and also of the copyist. One king was SrTdeva S?hi Surendra Vikram?ditya Nanda (Cf. Dutt 1939,1, p. 32) along with his wife Samidevi (10?) Trailokyadev! Bhatt?rik?. The scribes were ?rya Sthirabuddhi and Narendradatta, who might be the same as Mah? bh?naka Narendradatta, who copied the Ajitasenavy?k?rana (Dutt 1939). On another MS. there is the name Patoladeva S?hi Vajr?ditya Nandin. The name of another Patoladeva is found in an inscription incised on a rock near Hunza, celebrating the foundation of a town: Makarapura, by a chief of a district (called Hane sar?, Hunza) and a Mah?gajapati of Patoladeva Srldeva Surendr?ditya. Dr. Chakravarti states that this inscription is not later than the 7th century A.D. or even earlier. A MSS. found by M.S. Kaul in 1938, later than the MSS. of the Vajracchedik? and the Vinaya texts, records S?hi S?h?nus?hi Patoladeva. The Hatun village, in which the above mentioned inscription was found, is situated about three miles from Gilgit in Punyal, on the right bank of the Ishkuman river. We cannot know for certain whether the name is Buddhist or not; rather, it looks like as a Hindu name on account of the reference to Surendr?dityanandideva, his lineage descend? ing from Bhagadattavamsa. On Makaradeva and Makara as an epithet of Siva see: Tucci, 1963, p. 170. Chakravarti comparing the characters of the Hatun inscription with those of the MSS. comes to the conclusion that we know of two kings named Patola (101) (the one recor? ded in the MS. of M.S. Kaul and of whom we do not know the full name); Nandi may be Visnu or Siva; Siva is also called Nandideva, Nandisvara after the name of the bull nandin, his vehicle. But the so often recurring Aditya may also point to devotees of the Sun. Therefore, we here have valid documents in Sanskrit which testify to the existence of two dynasties ruling in Gilgit, called at that time Gilagitta. In Gilgit (in the Hatun inscription Gilagitta, in the Scythian itinerary: Gidagitti, in Chinese "little P'u-lu') people speak Shina, a Dardic dialect, but their kings in their (") We have some few but precious documents of Buddhist paintings from Gilgit.

It is difficult to ascertain the exact date of those Gilgit rulers because in some of these documents the Laukika era is employed, and the fundamental element for chronologi? cal determination can only be based upon paleographical criteria which are always relative. We shall see that the Chinese sources may contribute to establish the date of some of them. According to the Chinese Sources, besides Gilgit, "little P'u-lii", there was a Great P'u-lii where Buddhism prevailed. (Fuchs 1938, p. 443; Haneda 1957, p. 618) writes that to the north of Kashmir there are the Great P u-lii, Yang t'ung and So-po-tz'u (102a). They are all subject to the Tibetans: the above-mentioned three countries differ in dress, language and customs. There are in them temples and monks while the king and the people of Tibet do not embrace Buddhism. This information of Hui-ch'ao is precious. There is only one point on which he seems to be mistaken; I mean what he writes about the Yang-t'ung whom he claims to be Buddhist. If Pelliot and myself are right in considering Yang-t'ung a part of 2an Zun, (102) Tucci, 1956a, passim. (102a) Fuchs wrongly: Nepal. 72</page><page sequence="65">as the Suvarnagotra, or the Women-kingdoms, they were at that time preeminently Bonpo not Buddhists (103). But in Gilgit and in Baltistan and probably, in a lesser degree, in Ladakh there were Buddhists (104), though the fact that in 2an 2un there were Bonpo does not exclude the possibility of temples and priests of this religion also (104a). Here we must recall what we have already said about the expansion of the tribes speak? ing Dardic dialects (or dialects influenced by Dardic) up to the boundaries of Tibet, or better the boundaries of 2an Zun conquered by the Tibetans in the years 620-649. In Ladakh, tombs similar to those found in Sw?t have been discovered. Tucci 1973, p. 51 ff. Dardic dialects were spoken also in the Maknopa part of Ladakh, Hanu, Da, Kalatze down to 1931, at least when Dainelli first went there, and where I followed him a few years later. We do not know the ancient name of Ladakh; when first mentioned by Hs?an-tsang, it is called Mo lo so (muat l? sa) which Francke (JRAS, 1908, p. 189) interpreted as Mar sa "the low land". Pelliot 1959-73, p. 706, proposed Mra-sa, Mar sa} Ma r?sa. All such hypotheses have a weak point: they suppose that the name transcribed by Hs?an-tsang is a transcription of a Tibetan name (104b). But another hypothesis is possible: we have seen that so sometimes is wrongly written for po; thus we cannot exclude an original reading mo lo p'o, m? la va instead of mo lo so. We know from the Brhatsamhit? XIV, 27, that in the North there are the M?lava and the M?draka. Equally the Dharmavibh?s? quo? ted by Levi, Befeo 1905 and the R?m?yana, Levi JA. 1918, Tome XI, p. 125, mention M?? lava, an Himalayan people. Since the Tibetan dynasty had not yet conquered Ladakh it is useless to search for a Tibetan original at the basis of "Moloso", "Molop'o". According to Hs?an-tsang the country was also known under another name, San po ho, (S?m pu? x? * Samp?ka) (said to be to the west of 2an 2un); shall we therefore deduce that Ladakh was divided into two parts: Mo lo so (or p'o) to the West, San po ho, * Samp?ka to the East? Further researches are needed to clarify this point. In Dras, three days march after crossing the Zojila (104c), just to the left (103) Pelliot, 1959-1973, pp. 671 ff. Tucci, 1956b, pp. 92 ff. (104) The presence of Buddhist monasteries on the route to and from Gilgit is confirmed by the Sak? itinerary (Bailey, 1936, p. 255); after seven days from a town Sarad?gi (which Morgenstierne reads Sarak?gi and identifies, rightly, I think, with Sarikol Morgenstierne NTS, 1942, p. 269) one reaches a town called Icahanagari in which there are three Sangh?r?mas; other three Sangh?r?mas are near the ? Golden River? (In? dus), in a place called Syadim. Near the bridge, in proximity of river Sind (Indus), four Sangh?? r?mas; four stone Sangh?r?mas in Gidagltti (Gil? git); no mention of Sangh?r?mas in Silathasa, Si dathasi, Sidatasi, Chilas. (104a) In Lamayuru I collected some old Bonpo manuscripts and the monks of that mo nastery told me that formerly Lamayuru was a Bon centre. (104b) jn tne 2an zun language, mar, mar zi, mar ti means gold (some zan zun words may be compared with those of Lahul), but the problem is: how far did the 2an zun people extend west? wards of Western Tibet? Stein R.A., Langue zan zun du Bon organise BEFEO 1971, p. 244. This problem has been discussed anew by Prof. Petech 1977. But this part of Baltistan and La? dakh and Western Tibet need a deep investigation: chiefly as regards the ethnic groups and thier boundaries or succession: who were and which were the foundaries of the So-po-tzu of Hui ch'ao or the skal-Mon and the Mon or the K'ri-te, or the Ki-li-to or the inhabitants of Guge? Only a careful study of the dialects, of the toponomy of places, mountains and rivers and excavations can contribute to a solution of these problems. 73</page><page sequence="66">of the track to Leh, I saw in 1930 two stelae the first one higher, and the other one lower, re? presenting Lokesvara and Maitreya. Both bear inscriptions which were reproduced by Cun? ningham 1848 pp. 119-201; Id. 1854 p. 381-382 PI. XXIX, XXX, Francke 1907, PI. facing p. 52 fig. 1, Biasutti-Dainelli 1925 vol. IX, p. 77 and PI. XVII. The inscriptions, as reproduced by Cunningham, must have been copied by an illiterate pandit, and are hardly legible. The transcription made by the same pandit is meaningless for the most part: the only words which seem to be certain are Lokesvara \_ma?^maitreya pratisth?punyena bhavatu. I had rubbings made of them, but they were lost when the pony that carried them, stored in a box, fell into the river. Anyhow, these inscriptions confirm what Hui ch'ao writes. But by the time of Hsiian-tsang the Tibetans had only reduced under control Zan Zun (the women's kingdom, Suvarnagotra) and we have to wait for the dissolution of the Tibetan dynasty (after 842) for the beginning of the conquest of Ladakh by the Tibetans. Up to the time of the establishment of the royal dynasty, there is no reason to suppose that those people spoke Tibetan: some tribes might have already been converted to Buddhism through Dardistan or Kashmir, perhaps on account of the geographical proximity; their language and culture might also have been influenced in the Western or N.W. parts by that of Zan Zun, but Dardic must have predominated. 38. Kings of Dardistan Most probably Hinduism spread in the course of time along with Buddhism. The religious situation of Ladakh is unknown until after the conquest by a scion of the Tibetan dynasty. Buddhism then widely spread. Kalhana records many Dard princes who often tried to invade the Kashmir territory, and who bear a Sanskrit name. Under Ananta (1028-1063) it was Acalamangala with seven Mleccha princes; here Mleccha means Muslim and it therefore shows that some understanding had already been established between Daradas and Muslims, and perhaps that the conversion to Islam had alrea? dy begun to invade the country. Acalamangala was killed in battle. Under Harsa (1089-1111) the Daradas attempted a new incursion and were successful in the beginning; no name is given of their chief. In the times of Uccala (1101-1111) the Dard king Jagaddala went in aid of a rebellious party. King Sujjala (1112-20), went to meet Manidhara, ruler of the Daradas; when Jayasimha ruled in Kashmir (1128-49), a Darada prince was called to lend assistance to the underhand plotting of a minister. Later, the Daradas are called by Kal? hana: Mlecchas, which means that in the meantime they or their rulers had been for the most part converted to Islam. "Islam had already made great progress in the twelfth century". Stein 1961, Vol. II, p. 217. If the names of the above-mentioned Dard rulers are Hindus, this does not imply that Buddhism had been altogether forgotten. (io4c) ^he Tibetans interpret the name as bdud bit la "the pass of the four devils" on account of the dangers one is likely to meet in crossing it. But evidently it is a learned etymology proposed by some Lama. 74</page><page sequence="67">The information on Sw?t, found in the records of the Chinese pilgrims is confirmed and completed by that supplied by the T'ang Shu (Chavannes 1903, p. 28). It is said that there were five major towns (105). There had been missions from Uddiy?na to China in the years 502, 511, 518, 521. (Levi, Chavannes J.A. 1895, p. 348 note). In the year 642 king Ta-mo-yin-t'o-ho-szu sent camphor to the emperor of China and in exchange he received the imperial seal of investiture. In the year 665 ambassadors from Uddiy?na went to the Imperial Court. Later, Uddiy?na was, although indirectly, involved in the fights against the Arabs who had pene? trated into the Pamirs (Chavannes 1903, p. 129 n. 2); the Chinese did not intervene at the moment, but in the year 720 they sent some ambassadors to confer upon the king of Uddiy?na and other neighbouring states the investiture, as a reward for having opposed the Arabs (106) (Chavannes p. 192). In the year 745, China conferred upon the king of Ki-pin the investiture of King of "Ki-pin and Uddiy?na", and in about 748 the king of Ki-pin sent tributes to China (Chavannes p. 132 and note) which means that Sw?t had lost its independence to Ka pisa (Id. p. 294). We do not know why, but it is possible that, in the troubled situation of the Pamir states, when China and Tibet collided, Sw?t might have sided with the Tibetans, who were at its very borders (106a). 39. Swat between China and Tibet The eight century was rich in events in the Gilgit (Chinese: Little P'u-l?) Baltistan (Chi? nese: Great P'u-l?) and Pamir area, and consequently also in Sw?t, on account of the expansion of the Tibetans who aimed at the conquest of the "four garrisons" of Central Asia, while the Arab incursions represented for the Chinese another impending danger. China aimed at the control of Gilgit, which had a great strategical importance, since it was the meeting (105) It is difficult to identify them all because their importance may have changed in the course of time. Meng-chieh-li is certainly Mingora (not Mangalaor, as I have proven in the Report 1958); another town certainly was Udegram with its imposing castle (its ruins are called now R?jgira); a third one might have been Aligr?ma. On the right side of the river there are some very large archaeological sites, which testify to the former existence of large urban centers, e.g. Tu tano Bandai, Dangarkot, Shahdheri and Tangai near the Shor Khwar. Graveyards were found in Tu tano Bandai and Dangarkot, Tucci 1958, p. 327, note 24, I think to have identified some places of importance: in that note (second column) the pas? sage ? Another point... solve this problem ? must be cancelled. (106) The name of this king is: Ta-mo-yin-t'o ho-szu *d'at mu? ien d'? yjk sie. Perhaps the first four characters may transcribe a Prakrit Dhammenda (for Dharmendra); as to yjk sie one may suppose, h?sa, joy, smile. But a name Dhar mendrah?sa is hardly possible. (106a) I think it is interesting to add that some years ago I was shown, by Prince Aurang zeb of Sw?t, a silver bullion with a Chinese date on it, corresponding, if I remerber well, to 1903. It had been given him by the Nabab of Hunza. This shows that occasional exchanges of tributes and gifts between China and Hunza had been going on up to that year. 75</page><page sequence="68">point of the roads and the tracks joining India to Central Asia via Kunar to the West, Gurais or Chilas, Astor, Bunji to the East. The Chinese, through diplomacy and military ac? tions tried to check the Tibetan expansion, relying on the ability of a famous general, Kao Hsien-chih; but after his defeat by the Quarluq in 751 the situation changed. The Tibe? tans did not give up their programme of expansion. They moreover went so far as to occupy, even if for a short time, Ch'ang-an, the Imperial capital. In the treaty of 783 the Chinese acknowledged the Tibetan rule over the Central Asian regions they had conque? red, including also the Tarim-basin. The mention of the great P'u-lii (Chavannes 1903, p. 149), contained in the T'ang shu, is very concise; after having said that it was subject to the Tibetans, it adds that it had thrice sent ambassadors to China in the year 696, down to the period of K'ai-yuen, 713-741; it mentions its two kings. These kings are: Su-fu-she-li-chih-li-ni and his son, Su-lin-t'o-i-chih. Chavannes sug? gests (with a query) for the latter name an original Surendr?ditya (which philologically is rather difficult); the Chinese seems to be based upon a Prakrit original * Surendaicca(e). In the list of the kings of Gilgit we have met two Surendr?ditya of the Patola dynasty. One of them died in 720. But from Hui-ch'ao passing in those parts about 726, we gather a very important in? formation; the great P'u-lii was the original seat of the king of small P'u-lii; [being afraid of the Tibetans?] the above said king left "great P'u-lii" and retired to Gilgit. This king may quite well be Surendaicca. But those who followed his example were not many. The upper classes and the commoners preferred to remain at home. After the death of Mo-chin-mang who succeded him and that of his sons, the rulership passed over to Su-shih-li-chi, * Suo siet (Mm. si) ljiYsi, who changed the politics of Mo-chin mang and sided with the Tibetans. Concerning the capital of Great P'u-lii we know from Hui-ch'ao that it was in what once was Great P'u-l?; it is logical to think that there being no news of any internal rebellion or any warlike intervention of the Tibetans, the capital of the dynasty of Great P'u-lii remained in the same place as before i.e. Ye-to near the river So-i; Ye-t'o is called Ye-ho by Wu k'ung; Ye t'o is * ngi?t t'a (in Mm. ye = ga) which may be: * Gar ta, sKardo; the river Soi = * s? i. Near the capital there was another big town called Kia-pu-lo, certainly Kapalu (107) of today. The king Mo-chin-mang, in the period K'ai-yuen (713-741), sent ambassadors to the court. As I said above, there seems to have occurred in little P'u-lii a change of dynasty with Mo-chin-mang. If so, the event happened after 720 and before the end of period K'ai y?en 741, because as Chavannes rightly suggests, the above-mentioned Su O * kia pu la. In Kapalu crops were abundant on the alluvial soil: but it was later ravaged because the Shayok river changed its course (Biasutti-Dainelli 1925). The above-quoted authors remarked that Ka palu has all the requirements to become a great centre; farming is very extensive, and it is even now the chief populated centre of the whole region. 76</page><page sequence="69">fu-she-li-chih-li-ni was alive in 719, but died in 720; in this very year, his son Su-lin-t'o-i chih was given the royal investiture (Chavannes addenda p. 44, note 1). As regards Kia-pu-lo = Kapalu I suppose that we must correct ? it is on top of the mountain to its west ? (is west here a mistake for east?). On the confusion between East and West in this very context see Chav. 1903, p. 150 n. 1, 2. The distance of the place, 500 li from Wakh?n and 500 li from Kashmir, indicates that it was the very middle of the route. In the sixteenth century Kapalu was the chief town from which 'Ali Mir Shir Khan started for his subjection of Baltistan after which he founded or better rebuilt Skardo (Barthold E.I si. s.v. Tibet p. 781). I realize that the identification of *ngi?t t'a, *ga ta with Skardo presents some pho? ne tical difficulties, but we do not know which was the original spelling of the name of that town Tibetanised by the Tibetans as Skardo; nor can we state that the Chinese transcrip? tion refers to a Tibetan original; I suppose that it was based on a name which was no Tibetan but Balti or Dardic. Anyhow about the fact that an important source like the "story of the Li kingdom" refers often to Skardo as a capital there seems to be no doubt. This book has been studied and translated by F. W. Thomas TLT. 1935-1955. From it we know its most important events; we learn that a Vijayavarman was king of Skardo, after the defeat inflicted on the Tibetans by the Chinese; that expedition of the Chinese barred the approach of the Tibetans to the Pamirs (Thomas, Ibid. I, p. 161); there was a direct communication between Skardo and Gilgit via Nagar, ibid. I, p. 154; besides the other marauders in the route Skardo-Chinese Turkestan, the robbers of Hunza were specially dangerous, ibid., 155-156. The same text speaks of the realm and even of the realms of Skardo; Ibid. I, 191-192. Another story tells how Vimalaprabh?, in a former life, ex? pressed the intense desire to be reborn as daughter of the king of Skardo. Ibid. 199. Buddhist books were sent to Skardo (108). Ibid. I, 255. Thus it is ascertained by these and other facts also that Skardo was for some time the capital of Baltistan and a Buddhist cen? tre of a relevant importance. The information of Hui-ch'ao is thus fully confirmed and implicitly also the importance of the roads directly connecting Baltistan or the Tibetans who had occupied it, with Central Asia. Thus the necessity of controlling also the Kunar route far away from their bases is much reduced for the Tibetans. The identification of Kapalu and Katsura, Kasara, Katsara confirms that the localization of Skardo. Katsara (p. 79 note 110) is only half a day's march from Skardo. At Kapalu, Kapallu three paths join: one to Skardo, five marches; one to Shigar four marches; another one to Leh. We find peculiar names between Shigar and Kapalu: Kasurmik, Thalle, Kuru, Ol moik, Barangus. While discussing the problem of Kipin (see on Kipin the study of Petech, 1950, p. 63) (108) In Skardo there are very good Buddhist remains: some isolated huge boulders with fine engraved images deserve special mention (Bia sutti-Dainelli 1925 PL XIV, XV); the 21 Bud dhas of the confession of sins {Ituh bsags in Ti? betan), a standing Buddha in bodhyahgi mudr? (Vairocana). Very interesting are the images of the donors. 77</page><page sequence="70">Levi et Chavannes J.A. 1895 p. 377 suppose that the upper part of the Kabul river ran in another country than Gandh?ra and think that it was P'u-lii bordering West Uddiy?na and they identify Kia-pu-lo with Kabul; but such a proposal seems hardly acceptable. There were then a pro-Tibetan party in Dardistan and a pro-Chinese party in Gilgit. The leadership of the family of Gilgit (of Surendaicca) came soon to an end. This seems clear if we read the names of the new rulers of Gilgit: Mo-chin-mang, * must - kbn - mang and Mo lai-hsi, * Ma-lai-Yiei: therefore quite different types of names. A few of these names show a partial similarities with the ending syllabes of certain names found in the Mss. of Gilgit.

The conclusion, according to my mind, is that the Tibetan invasion divided the his? tory of P'u-lii into two periods: the first one, when P'u-lii included not only Gilgit but a great part of Baltistan under a dynasty which had already sent ambassadors to China in 696 and within the period 731-741 and a second one which starts with the retreat of Su-lin-t'o-i-chih to Gilgit proper, and the advent of Mo-chin-mang who ruled in little P'u-lii remaining on good terms with the Chinese, while the eastern P'u-lii was lost to the Tibetans. Thus, it seems almost certain that just then the real division of Dardistan into two parts took place: a) Gilgit = Little P'u-lii and b) Baltistan etc., i.e. the Great P'u-lii under the control of the Tibetans. Until that event, there had been only one P'u-lii. But Gilgit remained the pivot of the Chinese influence on the Central-Asia-India routes, and it was considered "the western gate" of the T'ang (Chavannes 1903, p. 150). Coming back to our narrative, as soon as Mo-chin-mang took possession of Gilgit, the Tibetans tried to persuade him to enter into an alliance with them: he refused be? cause in 722 we find the Tibetans attacking "little P'u-lii" (Pelliot, 1961, p. 99). King Mo-chin-mang was faithful to the Chinese, and greatly contributed to the defeat (109) Transcription according to Mm. 78</page><page sequence="71">of the Tibetans when they attacked him and captured nine of his towns, which however he reconquered. For his military feats he was thanked by the Court, and was given the title of King of Pu-l?, and Mo-chin-mang rendered his thanks in 733, and exchanges of Ambassadors and gifts are recorded in the following years. After the death of Mo chin-mang, of his son and of his elder brother Mo-lai-hsi, their successor Su-shih-li chih passed over to the Tibetans and married a Tibetan wife. But in 747 Kao Hsien-chih came to the rescue, and succeded not only in exterminating the pro-Tibetan party but also in sending as prisoners to China Su-shih-li-chih and his wife (109a). The above-mentioned changes which occurred after the death of Su-lin-t'o-i-chih seem to be confirmed by the fact that Great P'u-lii is no longer mentioned or rarely as a political en? tity. Also Mo-chin-mang is spoken of as King of P'u-l?, no distinction being made between great and small P'u-l?. But the Tibetans took another initiative after the death of Kao Hsien-chih, and in the year 753 Feng Ch'ang eh'ing who had succeeded Kao Hsien-chih attacked the Tibetans and near the town of Ho sa lao, defeated them (110). Such a situation, briefly summarized, involved willy-nilly the Pamir states in the con? flict between the two giants; they tried alternatively, according to the change of events, to be on friendly terms with the more successful party, but at the same time they did their best to avoid major troubles and to shelter the advantages of their position and of the trades taking place on the routes they controlled. However, they must have suffered the repercussions due to the unstable situation between China and Tibet. It is obvious that, especially from 745 to 755, the Tibetans tried to find allies in the Pamirs in order to cut off the routes from Gilgit to India: the easiest of these was that which passed through Chitr?l (eventually branching from there to Ka lam, Upper Swat - Sw?t) and reached Gandh?ra at Lamp?ka. The other one ran through Baltistan, reached the left side of the Indus crossing it at Bunji, then proceeded to Astor, and to Gurais. From Gurais the road approaches east of the Wular lake and then Srlnagar. There is no doubt that in the good season this route was followed for the transportation of salt and rice to Gilgit and the T'u-ho-lo (Tokharist?n). This is clearly indicated by the request of the King of the T'u-ho-lo to the Emperor of China in the year 749, after the (109a) On this memorable feat of Kao Hsien shih and the itinerary followed by him in his campaign see Stein, 1922, p. 112.

Ho sa lao, ancient pr. g'? s?t lau, can be identified with a place now called Katzar?h, Kat sura, Casara in the basin of the Indus on the way from Skardo to Burzil, on the right side of the river Indus. There exists an old document Tucci 1949 I, p. 252 note 36, Id. 1956, b p. 73 (which has been reproduced by later texts, modified ac? cording to the changed political situations) in which the Western territories under the control of the Tibetans are recorded. It goes back to a time when a part, at least, of the ? four garrisons ? was under the Tibetan rule; in fact Li (Khotan) is mentioned; then 2an-zun follows. 2ah-zun had been conquered in year 737, Hoffmann 1969, p. 149 mNa' ris skor gsurn or Bod sTod.

This request was caused by the allience established between the Tibetans and a small Pamir state Ch'ieh shih, or Chieh Shuai; there Tibetans had built some defence towers. The ruler of that state represented therefore another threat to the route from Gilgit to India. His name was P'o-te-mu, *bcuat d'ak must. He was defeated by Kao Hsien-chih and the investiture of king was given by the Imperial Court to his elder brother Su-chia * Suo ka, Chavannes 1963, p. 215, who re? ceived the investiture as king of Ch'ieh shih. There is some discussion on the location of this small state. We must first of all say that it is certainly different from Chitr?l, which is known to the Chinese sources as She mi. Stein 1921 p. 31 chiefly for geographical reasons, does not agree with the identification of She-mi or Shang-mi with Chitr?l, on the basis that She-mi or Shang-mi, being a mountainous country, cannot be Chitr?l, but it should be the valleys of Kafiristan to the West and South of Chitr?l. He identifies Chitr?l with Ch'ieh-shih of the Chinese sour? ces and proposes that She-mi indicates those fertile parts belonging to Kafiristan. But Pelliot 1963, p. 707 accepts the equivalence of She-mi or Shang-mi with Chitr?l, a fact supported by the name Sy?mar?ja (see above p. 63) given to it by Hui-ch'ao, and con? firmed by the Legend of Sy?ma (contained in the U drayan?vad?na, see ibid.) (1X1). The suggestion of Stein was however accepted by Chavannes in his addenda, p. 83 note 1; the latter, referring to an article of Biddulph, G. J. 1893, p. 342, f. in which the importance of Chilas is emphasized because its people controlled the route from Kashmir to Gilgit adds: "? l'epoque de T'ang les gens du Kafiristan descendaient sur Chilas pour tendre la main aux Tibetains et intercepter ainsi la route entre le Kashmir et le petit P'u-lii (Yasin)" (Cfr. Pelliot, 1959, p. 203). In the Khotanese Saka itinerary Chilas is called Silathasa, Sidathasi (Alberuni: Silt?s) the journey from that place to the bridge on the Indus took eight days. Cf. also Mor? genstierne N.T.S. XI, 1942, p. 269. Prof. Forte has kindly brought to my attention a passage of Hu San-hsing who has commented upon the Tzu-cbih T'ung-chien (Hongkong ed. 1971, p. 6897). He writes on this country Ch'ieh-shih: "Ch'ieh-shih also called Ch'ieh-shuai". "They belong to the Hu group and are close to the Tu-ho-lo. The great P'u-lii [some one says P'u-lii (112)] is straight to the west of Tibet. North of it there is little P'u-lii". This corresponds to the location of Chilas, having to the north little P'u-lii, Gilgit, but being to the west of Bal? tistan, subject to the Tibetans. On this problem I have consulted my colleague and friend Prof. Enoki who has been kind enough to reply in detail to my questions and to express his important conclusions (m) There are many cases of countries being named by the name of their king or Lord. See e.g. above p. 33. (112) This implies the identification of P'u-lii and Great P'u-l?. 80</page><page sequence="73">.00 t" 11 - !fo - j4 k SEAftpu-"; The~~~~~~~~~~~~~4 pergyso,4daa0 ihtebg ata h et CI The cargyso aaI with hoss()adtwheels a and the rie.</page><page sequence="74">Standard (?) from G?gdara I Dogs from G?gdara I, in different styles.</page><page sequence="75">^^^^^^^ \^ ^ Dogs from G?gdara I, in different styles.

But I think that the main trade went through the second route, the eastern one; Gilgit, Chil?s, Astor, where the Kunar people could not or only with great risk interfere. Of course, as it has been observed by many travellers, topogeographically Chitr?l is not a unity: already Grierson wrote that the Chitr?l valley was formerly inhabitated by Kala shas; but as Morgenstierne puts it the original homogeneous Dardic population of Ka? firistan, Chitr?l and Gilgit "was subsequently split into two by a wedge of Kho invasion, representing members of a different, but related tribes coming from the north of the Hin dukush". According to Morgenstierne (Some names of places and peoples of Hindu-Kush, BSOS vol. V, 1930-32, pag. 441, n. 3) S?m probably was the name of Upper Chitr?l (and he quotes Prasun Kafir sim gol, Sim?i = Chitr?l). Thus again there is no reason to deny the equivalence She-mi = Sy?ma[r?j?] = Chitr?l; of that some parts, west and south of Chitr?l, are particularly fertile. There is no valid reason to contest that these rich valleys might have been plundered by the Kafirs. But what has this to do with the big trade with Cen? tral Asia in which Tibet was interested? Thus I conclude that the route which the Pamir tribes might have threatened is not that of Kunar, but the eastern one, i.e. the Kashmir Astor-Gilgit route which was completely under their control. 40. The eastern routes The conclusions of Chavannes are not clear to me; does he mean that Ch'ieh-shih cor? responds to Chilas and does he admit that the Kafirs used to help the Tibetans in plunder? ing the caravans to and from Kashmir? Chilas of which Biddulph speaks is located not in Kunar (though there is a tribe of Chilasi in Kunar) (112a), but in Baltistan on the Indus. In this case it is highly improbable that the Ch'ieh-shih might have represented an impending threat to the Kunar route; the distance from Kunar to Chilas is considerable and the tracks are not easy. The Chilas to which Biddulph refers is on the route Srinagar-Gilgit described by the Saka itinerary. The description here summarized that Biddulph gives of the Chilas is not encouraging. The route from Kashmir to Gilgit through Gurais follows the Astor waters to the Indus then the ferry at Bunji (eighteen marches fro m Srinagar); "on the western boundary Chilas is open to Yaghistan": where it borders on the Indus the elevations, is of 3400 feet. The situation "has given the people a spirit of independence and a distintive character. They have been determined raiders from all time. During the Sikh occupation an expedition sent against Chilas met with a disastrous defeat". (Biddhulph 1893, p. 342). (112a) W. of Kunar river, East of Shumashti, Morgenstierne Notes on Shumashti NTS, XIII 1945 map to face p. 241 and p. 267 81</page><page sequence="77">The route through Chilas was the shortest and the safest for the Tibetans, because it was in the territories which they controlled: Chitr?l or Kafiristan were far away from their bases and to reach them through Darel, Sw?t, Kohistan was not an easy and short enter? prise. Moreover the Chinese Ch'ieh-shih (* yat, kat-si, sai) can hardly correspond to Chilas and their location near the Tu-ho-los (p. 80), as Hu San-hsin writes, excludes the identification with Chilas. Nor has Ch'ieh-shih any relation with the name of Chilas in the Saka itinerary, Sldathasa, Sidathasi (Silt?s, Alberuni). The only thing certain is that Chilas was on the shortest route from Gilgit to Kashmir, and that on the contrary Chitr?l re? mains far away from the Tibetan bases. This leads me to the same conclusions reached by Pelliot and to see in the Ch'ieh-shih an original Khasa, Kasi, Khasi, Khasia. The Khasas are a warring tribe which appears to have been one of the most mobile mountain tribes, parvat?srayinah. The Khasas are listed with the Cinas among the peoples of the Pamirs (Levi 1918, p. 118). They are the same as the Kakkha of Kashmir. Some tribes of them about the 10th 11th centuries migrated eastwards, and conquered a great part of Western Tibet and Western Nepal, as I think to have shown in Tucci 1956b. About them, and the correspondence bet? ween Khasa and Kashmiri Kakha see Stein 1961, Vol. I, 47 note to I, 317. For further information on the Khasas, see S. Levi 1905b, p. 259. S?rad?tanaya 1930, p. 310 verse 10 Kasa. The problem of the original habitat of the Khasas is still unsolved and it deserves a thorough investigation. From the inscriptions it appears that their real name was Khasa: "Asokacalla king of the Khasa" (Tucci 1956b, p. 66). In the inscription of Dullu (Ibid.) some of their kings have peculiar names: C?pa, C?pilla, Krasicalla, Kr?dhicalla, Kr?calla; in such names Krasi, Kr?dhi, Kr? correspond to Tib.: bKra sis, Grags btsan, Grags pa; the ending: calla corresponds to the epithet of the old Tibetan kings: Ide. (N?gadeva = N?ga lde). We find some of these names in Garhwal, Kumaon, Kashmir; C?vill? (kara) in Chamb? Asokacalla is also mentioned in some inscriptions of Kumaon. They are certainly descen? ded from the region of the Pamirs and the Hindukush (Atkinson 1888, p. 379 from Central Asia), and spread all over a great part of the Sub-Himalayan regions, but the original center of diffusion is still uncertain. On the inscription of Asokacalla found in Kumaon cf. Nau tiyal, 1969, pp. 70 ff. For the time being I can only propose: Ch'ieh-shih = Khasa; extraction: Hu (Hu San-hsin); situation: near the Tu-ho-lo. (Various transcriptions of Kh?syalipi in different translations of Lalitavistara and other works in Shiratori 1957, p. 29). Original contacts of the Kafirs with the Kh?sas who invaded Western Nepal and Western Tibet founding a kingdom in those parts, may be suggested ? certainly tentati? vely, at least at present ? by the wooden images of the ancestors of the dead which are found in some secluded parts of Nepal (Tucci 1956b, plates 17, 34). The suzerainity of the Tibetans over Baltistan which began in 727 implied that the 82</page><page sequence="78">northern route connecting Kashmir with Central Asia (see Wu k'ung, in Chavannes, Levi 1895, p. 356) who writes that three routes connected Kashmir with other parts of Asia (E: Tibet; N: P'u-l?; W: Gandh?ra) passed through their domains. The Chinese or their allies in Gilgit were a potential threat to the Tibetan routes of communication with Central Asia, because the Tibetans who menaced Gilgit, had a complete control of the routes India-Cen? tral Asia, which run through Baltistan. This implies that the Chinese wanted to cut not so much the routes in Yasin and Gilgit as the Tibetan routes leading to those places. In fact the Tibetans say to Mo-chin-mang that they do not covet his king? dom, but only wish to use its routes in order to attack the four garrisons. There? fore Kao Hsien-chih informs Su-she-li-chih that he wants free passages in little P'u-lii for entering great P'u-lii (Chavannes, p. 151); in the year 749 (Chavannes 214, n. 2) the Tu-ho-los write to the Chinese Court that, since the small state of Ch'ieh-shih threatens the route to Gilgit, they request the Chinese that the following year they should help them to subdue the Great P'u-l?, with the purpose that the connection with Yarkand, Khotan Kashgar or other places might be open. Which was done, because Kao Hsien-shih in 750 defeats Po-t'o-mo, the ruler of Ch'ieh-shih, and invests of the royal power his elder bro? ther (Chavannes 1903, p. 214, note 2 and p. 296). Therefore I think that the only aim of the Tibetans was to maintain indisturbed the use of the routes in their territories and specially of that of Chilas which is also followed by the pilgrims using the Saka itinerary. The route of Skardo or Chilas had been used from old times as documented by the inscription of Wima Kadphises found in Kalatze. Therefore the Chinese, in order to be sure in Gilgit tried their very best to assure the control of the routes of Baltistan and to find supporters in the local princes, instigating them against the Tibetans and also organizing mili? tary expeditions in the very core of Great P'u-lii: but the results did not last for a long time. In the campaign of 747 Kao Hsien-chih entered into P'u-lii (112b) (not little P'u-lii) up to about 60 li from the capital (Chavannes Ibid. p. 153, note 1); the bridge which the T'ang shu mentions on this occasion, had been built by the Tibetans, who did not rely on the local people: this may mean that the Tibetans were not yet completely sure of their Balti subjects in Great P'u-lii, but had established on them a kind of suzerainity. I think that the bridge here referred to corresponds to that which nowadays is the bridge of Bunji (112c). In conclusion I accept what Hui-ch'ao writes: that the kings of little P'u-lii, before Surendr?ditya resided in great P'u-lii; their capital was Ye t'o which to my mind is Skardo which, also today, is an important meeting point of routes and tracks; this location seems to be confirmed by the fact that when Feng Ch'ang-ch'ing invaded P'u-lii he went as far as a town whose Chinese name may well suggest Katsura (112d). (112b) P'u-l? = Great Pu-l? in many cases. (112c) One of the main aims of Kao Hsien-shih had been that of cutting the bridge. (H2d) All this does not exclude that the Kunar route was occasionally "protected" by local chiefs who in exchange of some financial advantages and of the building of some defence towers were considered by the Tibetans as allies, helpful be? cause eventually they could cause some disturban? ces to little caravans passing that way. But the results might have been pernicious to them as it was to Sw?t (p. 75). It is still unsolved for me the identifi? cation of the So yi, *sa i. It is believed 83</page><page sequence="79">The Eastern Route through Chilas was used in summer and it was short: it was followed up to 1931 by the Yarkandis coming from Turkestan. Immense caravans pas? sed also through the longest and hard tracks to Nubra and Leh, where they used to stop before leaving again for Kashmir and Mecca. Others descended through Skardo, the largest part through the Astor Route. The meeting point and the market for selling or exchanging goods was in Srinagar; all that came to a stop after the political events which happened in Central Asia after the advent of Bolshevism. To conclude: we can set down three main events in this part of the world: A) 747 little P'6-l? is reduced to subjection by Kao Hsien-chih. B) Second cam? paign by the same in 749-750. C) 753 after the death of Kao Hsien-chih, general Feng Ch'ang-ch'ing undertakes another campaign against great P'6-l? and captures their capital Ho-sa-lao (Chavannes 1903 addenda p. 83 n. 2). Ho-sa-lao ("*g?' s?t lau, now probably Katsura"). Thus, we may conclude that Sw?t had already come in contact with China, since the 6th century; this explains how at the times of Sung Y?n there was in Uddiy?na a Chinese interpreter; there must have been at that time not only an increasing number of pilgrims, but also a more consistent bulk of trade between Sw?t, Gilgit and Central Asia. The fact itself that Uddiy?na had sent missions to China from the beginning of the 7 th century shows that the pilgrims coming and going to and from China gave the first news of the great empire and of its power: its conquests had brought China near to its frontiers; when the Tibetans advanced, and the Chinese lost to them some parts of Central Asia, Sw?t could not help sharing the apprehensions resulting from the fact that the Pamir had become a meeting-point of the three rival powers: Sw?t opposed itself to the Arabs and was rewarded by the Chinese. A coin of Sam B. Ziy?d, 64 H = 683, G?bl 1976, p. 37 was found in Butkara (of course it may also be a stray coin, a single surviving testimonial of trade); there is little discrepancy between the date of the coin and that of the investiture given by China to the king of Sw?t. But if, at a later date the ruler of Kapisa received from the Chinese an in to correspond to the Gilgit river, but this should be better ascertained. In the Saka itinerary the track from Gilgit proceeds along the "Golden river", which is the Indus; but 6 -f a not better specified number of days before reaching Gilgit, the sources of the "golden water" are mentioned. "Golden water" may be the same as the Golden river; the sources of the Indus have been always uncertain for ancient geographers; the Greek placed them near ?ornos in Kohist?n (above p. 53) and some Indian grammarians vaguely among the Dards; Ptolemaeus indicates the Himaios. It is not excluded that the Gilgit river was taken as a branch of the golden river So yi, * s? i Ysar nijitt?ji; two towns, Skardo and Katsura (Katsara) are on the Indus; Kapalu, Khapalu, is on the Shayok. In India there are two traditions concerning the sources of the great rivers of the Jambudvipa. In Mah?y?na the four rivers Gang?, Sindhu, Vaksu, Sita issuing from the Anavatapta which for the Chinese is placed in the K'un lun: La motte 1944-49, pp. 385-386 note. In the Chinese maps published by Hermann 1922 the sources of the Indus are vaguely indi? cated in the K'un lun; its course is very imprecisely designed and its connection with other rivers chiefly the Gilgit river is not indicated. 84</page><page sequence="80">vestiture also as king of Sw?t, this may imply that Sw?t, impressed by the power of the Tibetans reaching Baltistan, had changed its policy. In the light of these facts it would seem that the journey of Padmasambhava to Tibet from Sw?t can be better explained. Perhaps he was not even officially invited, so to say, as the tradition narrates; he might have gone there of his own will, after having heard from some Sw?tis or Gilgit monks who had preceded him or from some of the Tibetans themselves who certainly passed through Sw?t, of the new possibilities open to Buddhist preachers, in attempting the evangelization of the Land of Snows. His departure must have caken place two or three years before the foundation of bSam yas 775 c. in Tibet; being perhaps the best appreciated thaumaturge, among the various siddhas and magicians, he enjoyed a great renown, and as all siddhas, he was a wandering man. Now that we have seen how Sw?t was in the very middle of the Chinese-Tibetan quarrels for the control of the main routes connecting Central Asia with Kashmir and Northern India, in a general way, it is clear that we have to look to Sw?t with other eyes. A region, by its very geographical situation open to all sorts of trade and cultural influences; a fact which explains its wealth documented by the immense number of religious settlements and its high culture testified by the archaeological discoveries; these documents will certainly greatly increase when the orthogonal town laying underneath the fields near the present play-ground of Mingora will be excavated. As a general conclusion, we may state that while the Pamir, the Hindukush, the Karakorum and Ladok so far have mainly attracted the attention of the Alpinists, now they must be considered as regions of great interest for protohistorians and historians of Buddhism.

The petition, which reached the court of T'ang on December 22, 749 (the 5th day of the 11th month of the 8th year of T'ien-pao) according to the Tzu-chih t*ung-chien ^ :U ^ , Bk. 216 (ed. Hong Kong, p. 6897), is recorded m the TsT?-fu y?an-kuei jjf^ ^ ^ \^ , Bk. 999, which is also reproduced in the. Chfuan-tfang-w?n ? j^t j^, Bk. 999, and is translated into French with commentaries by Ed. Chavannes (Documents sur les Tou kieue occidentaux , pp. 214-215). In this petition, the Yabghu asked the Emperor to send an army of the protectorate An-hsi J?[* j?&gt; or An-hsi tu-hu-fu 3b ^ "i^^ * situated at Kuei-tzu ^ |? or Kucha, to the Little and Big P'o-lu ffr ^ to get rid of the armies of both Chieh-shih and Tibetans, who were occupying these places, interfering the free transport between Tokharestan and India (Kashmir). According to the petition, the Chieh-shih were barbarians living in the moun tanous region m the neighbourhood of Tokharestan which they were threate? ning to invade. The petition was accepted and the general Kao Hsien-chih, it} 4M ^ , who led the army, returned from the victorious campaign to Chang an together with the king of the Chieh-shi whom he captured. The dispatch of Kao Hsien-chih and his triumphal return to the capital, which was some time before April 2 6, 750 (kSng-tzu j? or the 12th of the 3rd month of</page><page sequence="82">"the 9th year of T'ien-pao), is recorded in the Collation of Tzu-chih t'ung chien under the 2nd month of the 9th year of T'ien-pao (ed. Hong Kong, p. 6898). As is well-known, Kao Hsien-shi conquered the Little P'o-l? m 747 for the reason that the Little P'o-l? were put under the control of the Tibetans and not obedient to the T'ang. So, the campaign of 749/750 was the second one. The petition as reproduced m the Ts'S-fu ylian-kuei (and the Ch'uan-t'ang-w?n) is not complete and should be supplemented by quota? tions of the same petition m such books as the T'ai-p'mg huan-y?-chi ^ ^ jj: -j^ , Bk. 186, the Hsm T'ang-shu ^ ? jg: , Bk. 221 b, under T'u-ho-lo aj^ ^ gjj^ and the T'ang-hui-yao y| ^ , Bk. 99. But, still, some part of the petition is yet to be clarified. For instance, the Ts'?-fu y?an-kuei does not say that Tokharestan was being invaded by the Chieh-shi, while the T'ai-p'mg huan-yli-chi, the Hsm T'ang-shu, Bk. 221 b, and the Trang-hui-yao clearly state to the ef? fect that the Chieh-shi were invading T'u-ho-lo. So, Chavannes is appa? rently wrong when he took that the Chieh-shi were invading P'o-l? (Documents, p. 215). The Ts'^-fu yilan-kuei says that Kao Hsien-chih conquered P'o-l? (in 747) where he increased the number of garrison by 3. 000 and P'o-lii re? lied upon these soldiers, while the king of Chieh- shi and the Tibetans, ma? king use of this vacancy and instability, tried to invade To-ho-lo. But, it is not clear why the increase of 3. 000 (Chinese) soldiers in P'o-lii made the king of the Chieh-shi and the Tibetans venture to invade T'u-ho-lo. Actually, Chavannes just translates as: "Depuis que Kao Sien-tche a ouvert le Pou-lu, ll y a eu l? trois mille soldats de plus et le Pou-lu en a ete acca 87</page><page sequence="83">ble (Documents,, pp. 214-215). But, it seems that this does not make sense. Anyway, the petition makes it clear that a tribe named Chieh-shi were situated between Tfu-ho-lo and the Little and Big P'o-lli in the 11th month of the 9th year of Tfien-pao (Dec. 7, 750-Jan. 5, 751). At that time T'u-ho-lo meant two kinds of territories. The one is the whole territory under the control of the yabghu of T'u-ho-lo. According to a petition of P'u-liif^ jp[ , who was a younger brother of the yabghu of T'u-ho-lo, of the date of the 17th day, 11th month, 6th year of Kai-yuan (December 17, 718), the yabghu of T'u-ho-lo controled 12 countries which included Hsieh ylieh ifyf fjfe (Zab?list?n), Chi-pinjpJ ^ (Kapisa), Ku-t'u ^ (Khot t?i), Shih-han-na^ ;j #j] (Shag?niy?n), Chieh-su ^ (Sh?m?n), Shih-ni X) }$ (Shighn?n), I-ta ffa ^ (Hephthal), Hu-mi^ ^ (Wakh?n), Hu-shih-chien -j^ (Juzj?n), Fan-yen ^ (BSmiy?n), Chiu-ylieh t?-chien (for yen) ^ ^ j? ^ (for ^ ) (Kab?diy?n) and P'o-t'S-shan % ^ ^ (Badakhsh?n). (Tsf6-fu y?an-kuei, Bk. 999: Ch'uan-t'ang-wen, Bk. 999, Cf. Chavannes, Documents , pp. 200-202). The other is the domi? nion of the yabghu of T'u-ho-lo himself, of which the capital was situated at A-huan^ Jj^ or Ho-huan ^ (Walw?lij ; in the neighbourhood of what is now Kunduz) (cf. Chavannes, Documents, p. 68 note: J. Markwart, Wehrot und A rang , Leiden, 1938, p. 44). T'u-ho-lo which had been threatened by Chieh-shih with invasion must have been in Wakhan or m Badakhshan or in the Kapisa region. Seeing that the Badakhsh?n-Yasm and Gilgit (The Little P'o-lu)-Skardu (The Big P'o-lli) road has been the shortest and the most frequented cut to connect the Afghan Turkestan with the North India via Peshawar, it may have been 88</page><page sequence="84">Badakhshan that was being invaded by the Chieh-shi tribe at the end of 749. This means that the Chieh-shi occupied the upper-waters of Kunar. Hu San-sh?ng ^ ;|j gives a comment to the effect that the Chieh-shi are m the neighbourhood of T'u-ho-lo: Ta P!o-lU ^ ^ Baltistan^, which is also called Pu-lu dp , is situated directly to the west of T'u-fan ^ or Tibet and to the north of it = Ta P'o-l? ^ exists Hsian P'o Iii ^ ^~ Yasm and Gilgit region^ under the day of I-wei 2* ^ &gt; the 11th month, the 8th year of T'ien-pao of the Tzu-chih t'ung-chien, Bk. 216 (ed. Hong Kong, p. 6897). However, these comments, which are the extracts of relating passages of Tfang-shu (New History of the T'ang), Bk. 221 b and T'u-ho-lo and Ta P'o-lii, have nothing new or of particular notice for the location of Chieh-shi. 2) The name of Chieh-shi: There are three variants of the name Chieh-shi: Chieh-shi Hsm T'ang-shu, Bk. 221b under J ' T'u-ho-lo; T'ang-hui-yao, Bk. 99 (h)i?ji^ Chieh-shuai/shu Ts'6-fu yuan-kuei, Bk. 965, 999 (c)?i)4f Chieh-shi Tzu-chih-t'ung-chieh, Bk. 216; Ch'uan t'ang-w?n, Bk. 999; T'ai-p'ing huan yli-chi, Bk. 186 In this connection, Chavannes' Documents , p. 159, note 3 maybe compared. Among these three, (b)i^?^ and (c)jf^ jfip must be the same because these are used alternatively m the same petitions recorded in the books noted here.jj^ frp is a variant of the same prononciation. Seeing that (a) and (c) 89</page><page sequence="85">are making use of the same character ^ , jl^ ?f (b)&gt; which is seen m only Ts'?-fu ylian-kuei, can be looked upon as a corruption of According to Karlgren, Analytic Dictionary, Nos. 73 and 893 Chieh-shi have been pronounced as ?t/k?t si/sai or siuet under the T'ang and, if we take into our consideration of its location, Chieh-shi ( kat-si) may represent K?sh of K?shk?r as A. Stein has already pointed out (Ancient Khotan, 1, Oxford, 1907, p. 14). The K?shk?r is the name given to the river Kunar, especially to its downstream to the south of Chi tral. Chitral and its neighbourhood had also been known as Kashkar (T. H. Holdich, The Indian Borderland, London, 1901, p. 244; Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1st and 2nd editions under Citral ^Chitral x). The meaning and origin of the name is not known. According to the Shih-shih Hsi-y?-chi^ ^ &amp; *$i'ttj which is attributed to Tao-an ]J^Jfc (314-385) (quoted m the Shui-chmg-chu ^ j? Bk. 1), the present Kash gar m Chinese Turkestan was called Chia-sh^-lo-shihi^/^^i^, that is to say, Kctsha Raja. The Catalogue of Yaksa m the Mahamayuri records Khasesu which is transcribed as either Chia-sh?or Su-1? ^ in Chinese translations (S. Levi, Le catalogue des Yak$a dans la Mahama? yuri, JA, 1915, p. 52). These Chia-sh^i^ and Khasesu must have a meaning common to that of Kash of Kashkar. Phonetically chieh or^j| may represent kar, as seen from^?^ chih/t'o-chieh which is to be iden? tified with chakar, shakar or thakur "warrior", (Sinjo Mizutani ^^J^.^ Daito-saukiki ? $ jj^ j?A , Tokyo, 1971, pp. 27-28). But this does not prevent us from looking Chieh-shi as representing Kash. By the way, A. Stem has never tried to identify Chieh-shi with Ka? fir phonetically but only from geographical point of view. He looks upon</page><page sequence="86">the upper waters of Kunar as a part of Kafiristan. In connection with Chieh-shi, a mention must be made to the country oi4$J Chieh described by the T'ang-shu, Bk. 221b, Chavannes, who tran? slated the passage (Documents, p. 159 and note 3), takes it as an abbrevia? tion of Chieh-shi^ ^ and its variants. But, ijf] Chieh, which is situated to the north and east of Sh?-mi?fe&gt; ^ or what is now Chitral (compare G. Morgenstierne, The name Munjan and some other names of places and peoples m the Hindu Kush, BSOS, IV, 1930-31, p. 440), should not be con? fused with Chieh-shi which is to be located at, or to the south of, Chitr?l. The character^ chieh was pronounced as kiKp (Karlgren, Analytic Dictionary, should be considered as representing Kaf of Kafir. A detailed description ofjfi is given m the T'ai-p'mg huan-y?-chi, Bk. 186, which tells us the country is quite different from Chieh-shi m several points. (3) Three Chieh-shi names: 1) Chieh-shi : The name of the tribe or of the locality occupied by the tribe. See (2) The name of Chieh-shi. 2) P'o-t'S-mu/mei or mo|f^ : The name of the king who was capture by Kao Hsien-chih. (Ts'6-fu yuan-kuei, Bk. 965; Tzu-chih-t'ung-chien, Bk. 216). 3) Su-chia -^ jjfr : The name of the king who succeeded P'o-t'6-mu and who was entitled the king of the Chieh-shi by the T'ang (April 26, 750). (Ibid. ) (4) The situation of Udyana: As is already shown by Chavannes' translation (Documents, p. 132 and note 4), the king of Kapisa was entitled as the king of Udyana in 745, that is to say, Kapisa and Udy?na were united under the same ruler. This is the translation of the siatement of T'ang-shu, Bk. 221a, and the imperial order of the investiture dated October 25, 745 (the 22nd day of the 9th month of the 4th year of T'ien-pao) is recorded m the Tsffe-fu yiian-kuei, Bk. 96 5. 91</page><page sequence="87">APPENDIX II On the Petroglyphs of Gogdara I in Swat by B. Brent je s The petroglyphs brought up to now to light in the excavations of Gogdara I belong to the very few of this kind the datations of which, drawn by analogies, is supported by stratigraphic observations. Prof. C. Silvi Antonini in statement sent to Prof. Tucci, writes: "In the site of Gog? dara during the excavation campaign of 1958 some petropglyphs have been found out in the area to the south of Udegram, on a rocky layer 5 meters high. The trench was meant to find out the lowest level, but it did not give satisfying results as regards potsherds. On the basis of analogies with protohistorical Iranian and Centroasiatic ware we are inclined to think that the petroglyphs are to be placed within a period of time going from the 2nd millennium B.C. to the beginning of the 1st millennium B.C. Some stylistic details, such as the representation of cars drawn by animals, suggest the hypothesis that, at least for a certain period of time, the authors of the petroglyphs belonged to a social group stably installed in this area. In such a prospective it might be possible to assume a con? nection with the population who left the graveyards of Butkara, K?telai, Loebanr, and the site of Aligr?ma (2nd millennium B.C.)". We can also get to this datation through analogies with similar images, since we are dealing with the repeatedly documented reproduction of two-wheeled battle-carts or race-carts with a driver, in the same way as they are represented in the late Bronze Age in a large area going from China up to Sweden, and to Northern Africa. In the case here considered the draught animals are so stylised that, as they are, they could simply be defined "quadrupeds". But regarding a two-wheeled cart of this pe? riod, they can only be horses, to which also recall the long tails of the animals represen? ted in the figures. The representation of the cart is far from our present way of thinking, but is in con? formity with a descriptive reproduction, since the existence of all the essential elements goes beyond our visual image. The wheels look like two glass lenses connected by a stirrup-like axle to both sides of the cart, while the driver, at least in the big clearer figure, is standing up on the ending back part of the axle. We know similar images in the Val Camonica, in Ain Kudeirat (Sinai), Megiddo, and in Tassili of Ajjers in Algeria (see J. Spruytte, Les chars et les che vaux de Tamadjert, Bull Soc. Roy. Beige Anthrop. Prehist., 76: 73-78, 1966, fig. 3, etc.). The large diffusion of those images prevents us from advancing any deduction since this way of drawing answers to a very spread, world-wide "forma mentis". Things are different for what concerns the rock images of Central Asia since their au? thors can be historically connected to the old population of Swat. As far as in the Ferghana valley, near to Sajmali-Tas, we can find images of this kind of carts of the old Iranian era 92</page><page sequence="88">(about 1000 B.C.) (see among others A.N. Bernstam, NaskaPnje izobrazenija Sajmali Tas. in Sovetskaja Etnografija, 1952, 2, Karatau (Kazakhstan) that are represented like those of the old Iranian era (M.K. Kadyrbaev and A.N. Mar'jasev: Karatauskie Kolesnizy, in: Ar cheologiceskie Issledovanija v Kazachstane, Alma Ata 1973; pp. 128-145). Here camels and oxen also appear as draught beasts besides horses. Also in the Indian rock images (of a more recent period) we can see "open wheeled" carts with non-parallel wheels, like in Mandori (see D.H. Gordon, The prehistoric background of Indian culture 2nd edition, Bombay 1960, pi. XXIII etc.). From the photographs we cannot understand if the less clear and smaller images of the wall are older or only represented in a second level. From the historical background, the general view of the images coming from Gogdara I must be pla? ced in the period of the "war carts" that lasted up to the beginning of the 1st millennium B.C., and in this way the datation resulting from the tombs would be confirmed. The 2nd group belongs, according to the findings of the tombs, to the higher strata of G?gdara I, and the animals represented seem to be of the family of dogs, notwithstanding the peculiar interior drawing, that nevertheless appears as a drawing form also in ceramics of different periods. The height of the paws and the shape of the tail, as also the length, allow us to think that these animals are dogs. The finding of dogs as main animals of rock images indicates the presence of Indo-Iranian authors, since we know the great importance of dogs in the old Iranian religions and also in other Indo-European and Northern Asiatic conceptions. Dogs can be found on rock images much more often than carts, so that the evidence is superfluous. It is enough for us to indicate the representation of dogs in scenes of worship in Sajmali-Tas (see Bernstam, op. cit., fig. 15). The difference in the interior drawing could let us think at different plays of colours, but we cannot be sure of this. To this group belong both the animals with a bee's nest ornamental framework draw? ing, and the animals whose body is formed by two triangles settled like a double axe (cf. 157/4 and 153/8). Probably we are in front of two groups of figures of different periods, anyway this cannot be told only by looking at the photos at my disposal. The zebu (?), the head of which has probably been partly destroyed by the pashtu inscription, does not look thoroughly in good state. Fascinating is the standard (?) (165/8/9) reminding the square pins of Luristan (cf. for in stance H. Frankfort, Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, Harmondsworth, 1954, pi. 176 A) without having their decorative figures. It might be a symbol of cult or battle. Unfortunately, also in this case, there are no connecting links with other rocky figures. It would be interesting to find out some connections with the scenes of the waggons. There is a certain similarity with the schematic figures of the houses of the Val Camonica, but here the well-defined vertical axis is on the contrary probably a pole, lacking in the Val Camonica, to which is hung up a symbol like a shield. The closest similarity to the standard of the rock images can be found on the coins of the Fratadara of Fars. The standard of Fars is characterized by straight lines intersec? ting one another in the centre as in the standard graved on the rocks. 93</page><page sequence="89">BIBLIOGRAPHY (*) Abaeva 1975: T.G.

Perhaps we may find a confirmation of the geographical location of the Haumavarga near the Pamirs in the fact that the first part of their name has been connected with haoma (Kent p. 211 ? Haoma drinking ?, Wikander ? Die Leute die sich durch den Haoma Rausch in (wer)-W?lfe verwandeln? and chiefly Duchesne Guillemin 1960 p. 96). Their name may be derived from the fact that they were great drinkers of haoma growing in abundance in their habitat. The article by Litvinskij, Sak? Haumavarg? v svete sovetskih arheologieeskih issledovanij, Pestschrift Altheim, pp. 115 ff. (kind communication of Prof. Gherardo Gnoli) is unfortunately not accessible, at present, to me. p. 54, 1. 8 Later writers know, in Tibet, also the form Ilora, Gr?nwedel, 1915, p. 26. p. 69, 1. 11 The stories about the witches of Udy?na (= Uddiy?na) abound in later Tibetan litera? ture which refers to their magic performances and also to their cannibalism. They were supposed to be predominant as far as Ghazni and were considered to represent a peculiar class of dangerous creatures; therefore they stand alone; they have no relation at all with Buddhist, heterodox schools (Hindu), much less with the Mlecchas, Mussulmans (Gr?nwedel, 1915, p. 28). p. 71, 1. 16 Another gajapati, Sahkarasena, is mentioned as a donor of a beautiful image of Buddha, Pal, 1975, 30, a, b. 102</page><page sequence="98">Prat?p?ditya Pal's book is very interesting and useful; the only thing to which I dare to object is its title: Bronzes of Kashmir. There is no doubt that the largest part of his images come from Kashmir and its adjacent countries; many of them are clearly Hindu S?hi. But others are the work of local artisans: Baltistan had Buddhist centres in old time, since Buddhism was widely spread all over Transhimalaya from Gilgit up to Ladakh (see Hui ch'ao); one of the still unknown centres was certainly Skardo, where there are huge rock reliefs; the extension of suzerainty of Tibet upon Baltistan may have facilitated the diffusion of Buddhist art, and given impulse to local artistic schools; in fact looking at the photos of those images one perceives the difference which many of them reveal in style; many bronzes may have been carried into Ladak, Baltistan, Gilgit by travelling monks. Some of them show evident influences from Central-Asia (see: li lugs in Samada, Tucci Indo-Tibetica vol. IV, 1, p. 30). Some have certainly been cast in various places of all the Transhimalayan and Subhimalayan regions Chamb?, Kulu, Lahul etc. (Tucci, Ibid.). Now that Pratapaditya Pal has furnished us with such a large material it is necessary to inves? tigate the details and classify the appurtenance of each different group of images to a peculiar locality. The task is difficult but not impossible. The existence of separate artistic centres is testified in some places of W. Tibet: e.g. the now very small village of Luk was once famous for its paintings, as I could verify studying the old samples existing in the nearby I ha k'an and private chapels. The tradition was still alive in the place. Local people testified that Luk was once also famous for his wooden and metal images. p. 72, 1. 18 An image of Buddha published by Pal 1975, p. 31 was commissioned by Mah?r?j? dhir?ja-paramesvara-nandivikram?ditya: Pal is right in attributing this image to Gilgit area. p. 93 at the end The article of Prof. Brentjes had already been printed, when I received from him a second letter containing the following statement on the "standard": ? Ritzbild einer Standarte, deren Binnenzeichnung wie die geweihartigen Aufs?tze schwer zu interpretieren sind. Sie erinnert an quadratische "NadeF-K?pfe der Luristan-bronzen. Sie d?rfte zu den Streitwagenbildern geh?ren und eventuell ein Feldzeichen darstellen ?. 103</page></plain_text>
