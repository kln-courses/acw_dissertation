<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK NOTES Book Notes Social/Cultural Anthropology Malay Peasant Society and Leadership. S. Husin Ali. East Asian Social Science Mono- graphs. London: Oxford University Press, 1975. xi + 192 pp. $18.75 (cloth). Presents a picture of Malay leadership at the village level. Three villages are compared in terms of traditional leadership patterns and functions and in terms of village participation in contemporary political parties and the roles of local party leaders. Although the book reveals some methodological weaknesses and does not deal with the east coast of the peninsula, it is a useful complement to existing studies of the national government. [Douglas Raybeck] Levi-Strauss: Structuralism and Sociological Theory. C. R. Badcock. New York: Holmes and Meier, 1976. 125 pp. $7.50 (cloth). Not to be confused with a primer on Levi-Strauss or as another exposition of structuralism, this monographic essay traces Levi-Strauss as heir to French sociological traditions of Durkheim and Mauss, through his position on culture as communication and his con- junctions and disjunctions with Marx, Sartre, and Freud. Not a tour de force but rather a concise book delightfully succeeding in its limited aims. [Edwin A. Cook] Social Learning Theory. Albert Bandura. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1977. viii + 247 pp. $9.50 (cloth), $5.95 (paper). A continually expanding area of psychology, where Bandura continues to be a forerunner. Monograph briefly surveys recent theoretical and experimental advances in its field, prof- fers new findings bearing on neglected psychological processes or those only par- tially investigated. A multicausal theory de- pending on a continuous reciprocal interac- tion of cognitive, behavioral, and environ- mental factors. [Edwin A. Cook] Public and Private Self in Japan and the United States: Communicative Styles of Two Cultures. Dean C. Barnlund. Tokyo: Simul Press, 1975. (U.S. distribution by ISBS, Forest Grove, Oregon.) xiii + 201 pp. $12.00 (paper). Utilizing several psychologi- cal inventories, the author reports that Ja- panese students see themselves as "re- served," "silent," "cautious," "evasive," and "serious." Further, they see Americans as</page><page sequence="2">186 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978] being "self-assertive," "frank," "spontane- ous," "informal," "talkative," and "humor- ous." Additionally, the Japanese have a much smaller "public self," and a much larger "private self" than do the Americans. A final section deals with the differences in the communication styles in the two cul- tures. [John W. Connor] Culture and Its Creators, Essays in Honor of Edward Shils. Joseph Ben-David and Terry Nichols Clark, eds. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977. x + 325 pp. $15.00 (cloth). The relationship of ideology to social scientific interpretations of changing cultural conditions compose the theme occu- pying 13 eminent social commentators. Their essays, reflecting the pioneering efforts of Edward Shils to clarify the ideology of culture, span a wide range of topics from the end-of-ideology debate to the institutional- ization of systems of thought. [Veletta Canouts] Frans Blom, Maya Explorer. Robert L. Brunhouse. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1976. xiv + 291 pp. $10.00 (cloth). The volume adds to the growing list of autobiographies of Mayanists. Brum- house, in somewhat old-fashioned style, de- tails the life of a man whose secondary influence on Maya studies has had tremen- dous importance. There seems to be no question that the jungle civilization, whose fascination enticed so many explorers, will continue to draw readers about these adven- tures. [George J. Gumerman] A Handbook of Cross-National MMPI Re- search. James N. Butcher and Paolo Pan- cheri. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1976. viii + 470 pp. $20.00 (cloth). An outgrowth of the 7th Annual Sym- posium on Recent Developments in the Use of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), this volume explores problems involved in applying an objective personality inventory worldwide. Over 200 pages of appendixes add to the book's usefulness. A worthwhile contribution to the MMPI world literature. [Jon D. Swartz] Hawaiian Sculpture. J. Halley Cox and Wil- liam H. Davenport. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1974. ix + 198 pp. $15.00 (cloth). A superb collection with numerous plates. The text details provenance, Bishop Museum collection numbers, and socio- logical contextualization in Hawaiian so- ciety. The most precise and detailed review of the work is in an unpublished manuscript (5,000 words) by Roger G. Rose, Curator of Ethnology, Bernice P. Bishop Museum. [Ed- win A. Cook] Southeast Solomon Islands Cultural History: A Preliminary Survey. R. C. Green and M. M. Cresswell, eds. Bulletin 11. Wellington: Royal Society of New Zealand, 1976. 287 pp. n.p. (paper). Interim results of a broad interdisciplinary program designed to eluci- date the prehistory of Melanesia, this volume concentrates on a specific portion of the area particularly unknown prehistorically and providing an interface between the cultural complexes of Island Melanesia and those of West Polynesia. Investigations re- ported include about 15 projects in histori- cal linguistics (R. C. Green), agricultural systems and prehistory (Yen, Powell); re- ports on specific archaeological and ethno- historical sites at Star Harbour (R. C. Green), Ulawa (Hendren, Ward), Uki (R. C. Green, Kaschko), Santa Cruz (R. C. Green, Yen), Anuta (Kirch and Rosendahl), and Santa Ana (Swadling); Spanish settlement of the area (Allen); post Spanish but pre-1939 contact (R. C. Green); and S. M. Mead on "Becoming a Master Carver in the Star Harbour Area." A superb midproject report and a necessary library addition for students of Oceanic culture history. [Edwin A. Cook] Contributions to Anthropology: Selected Papers of A. Irving Hallowell. Introductions by Raymond D. Fogelson, Fred Eggan, Melford E. Spiro, George W. Stocking, An- thony F. C. Wallace, and Wilcomb E. Wash- burn. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1976. xvii + 529. $24.00 (cloth). A collec- tion of 13 articles (including one previously unpublished, "Northern Ojibwa Ecological Adaptation and Social Organization," 1976), organized into six major areas of Hallowell's interest, each with a separate introduction: (1) Autobiographical Notes, (2) History of Anthropology, (3) Psychology and Culture, (4) Ojibwa Ecology and Social Organization, (5) Ojibwa Culture and World View, and (6) Culture Change. It concludes with a supple- mentary bibliography of Hallowell's works. This book is a lasting demonstration of the timelessness of A. Irving Hallowell's contri- bution to anthropology. [Edwin A. Cook] United States Indian Tribal Courts: A Bibli- ography. Susan Karamessines, comp. Social Science Notes, 6. Ottawa: Northern Re- search Division, Ministry of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 1976. iv + 59 pp. n.p. (paper). Contains 329 entries, most- ly recent, including 1975. Most entries an- notated. Lists books, articles from anthro-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK NOTES 187 pological and legal periodicals, private association and government reports, confer- ence proceedings, and Indian law periodicals. Gives source and price for copies of some items. Under "Traditional Law-ways" 41 entries published 1926 to 1975. [Bruce B. MacLachlan] Indian Silverwork of the Southwest, Vol. 2. Dale Stuart King. Tucson: Dale Stuart King, 1977. 200 pp. $8.95 (cloth), $4.95 (paper). At every meeting of anthropologists there will be some segment of that population wearing southwestern Indian silver (with or without turquoise, coral, and the various forms of stabilized, i.e., impregnated, tur- quoise stones). Most wearers know very little (experience informs me) about their jewelry and often less on manufacturing techniques. This little book, nicely illustrated, will serve as a good introduction to the modern (post-1940, emphasis on post-1960) design styles and methods of manufacture. [Edwin A. Cook] Women in Spanish America: Annotated Bib- liography from Pre-Conquest to Contem- porary Times. Meri Knaster. Boston: G. K. Hall, 1977. liii + 696 pp. $38.00 (cloth). Valuable sourcebook on a neglected topic. Extensive annotations of books, articles, and pamphlets in English and Spanish; none after 1974. Geographic coverage: Middle and South America and Caribbean. Sample cate- gories: history, ethnographies, biographies, magic and religion, psychology, economics, marriage and family, women's liberation, etc. [Lawrence Kruckman] Patrons and Brokers in the East Arctic. Robert Paine, ed. Newfoundland Social and Economic Papers, 2. St. John's: Institute of Social and Economic Research, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1971. 111 pp. n.p. (cloth). Patron is defined as the actor in control of assets to be translated into influ- ence; the broker processes information by making changes of emphasis and/or content; the go-between abstains from manipulations. Emphasis is put on role and role playing, and role perceptions by different parties. Con- ceptual framework is applied to the perfor- mances of middlemen in Canadian communi- ties. An important contribution to the trans- actional theory of middlemen. [Asen Balikci I Pissing in the Snow and Other Folktales. Vance Randolph. Introduction by Rayna Green. Annotations by Frank A. Hoffman. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1976. xxxiii + 153 pp. $7.95 (cloth). With this publication of bawdy tales, Vance Ran- dolph's singular collection of Ozark folklore is freshly revitalized. The publication is significant, sui generis, as a rare expression of the structure and context of such tales and is also significant in the context of Ozark folktales relating to all cultural tradi- tions. [Veletta Canouts] To Spoil the Sun. Joyce Rockwood. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1976. 180 pp. $6.95 (cloth). Without resorting to a pedantic narrative of anthropological expla- nation, Joyce Rockwood's novel conveys the cultural symbolism and mores of the Chero- kee in the context of a thoroughly sensitive and insightful treatment of the time of contact between the Old and New Worlds. [Veletta Canouts] The Cold Fire: Alienation and the Myth of Culture. Stanley D. Rosenberg. Hanover, New Hampshire: University Press of New England for Dartmouth College, 1976. x + 214 pp. $10.00 (cloth). Citing anthropologi- cal, psychiatric, and literary sources, the authors creatively explore the experience of alienation. Theirs is a provocative analysis of reality achieved through a sometimes painful awareness of experience distinct from cul- tural interpretations. More than a negation of the cultural self, alienation offers an alternative to the futile escape into cultural myths. [Veletta Canouts] In the Land of Cave and Cliff Dwellers. Frederick Schwatka. Glorieta, New Mexico: Rio Grande Press, 1977. 27 + x + 391 pp. $15.00 (cloth). [Facsimile reprint with new introduction by Bernard L. Fontana. First ed. 1892, New York. ] The Rio Grande Press is known for its fine reprints of rare and/or important books on the western United States, particularly history and anthro- pology. This volume is a bibliographical rarity, almost unknown, and interesting be- cause Schwatka traveled through Chihuahua and Sonora in 1888-89, prior to Carl Lum- holtz, whose classic Unknown Mexico has also been reprinted recently by the Rio Grande Press (rev. AA 79:681-682). Schwat- ka's observations and speculations on the "shy and bashful" Tarahumara are therefore of some interest. Fontana's informative bio- graphical introduction (pp. 13-27) makes it clear, however, that the author was neither scholar nor scientist but wrote frankly asan adventurous traveler. The many quaint origi- nal illustrations in this reprint and eight new color photographs of the Tarahumara greatly enhance the reader's enjoyment of this volume. [Richard B. Woodbury ]</page><page sequence="4">188 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978] Cross-Cultural Anxiety. Charles D. Spiel- berger and Rogelio Diaz-Guerrero, eds. Clini- cal and Community Psychology Series. Lon- don: Hemisphere, 1976. (U.S. distribution by Halsted, New York.) xii + 195 pp. $17.95 (cloth). Twelve papers by 23 contributors report on the nature and measurement of anxiety in Brazil, Canada, Greece, India, Italy, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Turkey, and the United States. Principally using forms of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, these studies reveal that such inventories can be used successfully to mea- sure anxiety in different languages and cul- tures. [Jon D. Swartz] Freudianism: A Marxist Critique. V. N. Vololinov. I. R. Titunik, trans. New York: Academic, 1976. xvii + 153 pp. $10.95/f6.70 (cloth). [Published 1927 as Frejdizm: kriticheskii ocherk.] This volume was written in the late 1920s as Freudian and Marxist theory clashed in the Soviet Union. Vologinov summarizes Freudian per- spectives, isolates ideological assumptions, and offers a materialist critique of this position. This work survives because of its stylistic clarity, its broad focus, and its implications for structural theory. [Joseph M. Nixon] Dimity Convictions: The American Woman in the Nineteenth Century. Barbara Welter. Athens: Ohio University Press, 1976. 230 pp. $12.00 (cloth), $4.50 (paper). In a collection of short, independent essays, Wel- ter outlines the major tenets of American womanhood found in religion, medicine, and New England intellectualism during the 1800s. Interestingly, the institutionalization of these tenets allowed the emergence of women while at the same time confined their outlets. [Veletta Canouts] Voices in the Wind: Central and South American Legends. Alex Whitney. New York: David McKay, 1976. ix + 57 pp. $5.95 (cloth). This slim, handsome volume contains six Latin American legends drawn from six ancient cultures. Each legend is prefaced by a short historical synopsis of the culture, i.e., Maya, etc., but the tales them- selves are not identified as to context, source, or version and have no common theme. [Veletta Canouts] LAAG Contributions to Afro-American Eth- nohistory in Latin America and the Carib- bean. Norman E. Whitten, Jr. Contributions of the Latin American Anthropology Group, 1. ii + 66 pp. $5.00 (paper). Studies of U.S. blacks in Trinidad in the 19th century (Stewart), a "black ghetto" in Haiti's capital (Laguerre), ethnicity among lower-class blacks in Surinam (Hurtz and Pierce), Afri- can influences on kinship symbolism among the Goajiro of Colombia and Venezuela (Wilbert), 19th-century attempts to locate U.S. blacks in other New World areas (Olien), and a general appeal (previously published) for using an ethnohistorical ap- proach to the study of black populations in Mexico (Beltran). Will interest particular areal specialists, but no new ground is broken in ethnohistorical methodologies. [Jerome S. Handler] Race, Color, and the Young Child. John E. Williams and J. Kenneth Morland. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1976. xiv + 360 pp. $12.95 (cloth). The understanding of how and what children learn about race and color is of great importance in a multiracial society. An anthropologist and psychologist have collab- orated to study racial attitudes in children, with interesting results. They describe a general cultural framework within which learning occurs, review concepts of race and color, discuss the modification of color and racial attitudes, and provide a developmental theory on color racial bias. [Heather A. Wolfe] Applied Anthropology The Conflict between the California Indian and White Civilization. Sherburne F. Cook. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976. xi + 522 pp. $24.75 (cloth), $6.95 (paper). Six interrelated essays, originally published in Ibero-Americana (1940-43), in- vestigate initial native reaction to Spanish missions; the response of non-Mission Indi- ans to Spanish encroachment; the Anglo- American invasion; native marriage, divorce, and population trends; and dietary adapta- tion by natives and Europeans. An animal biologist by training, Cook is a harbinger of formal ethnohistoric method. Employing ex- haustive data, he applies rigorous statistical analysis, thereby destroying the saintly image of missionization, and exposing the cruelty of white contact. He discusses dis- ease, starvation, war casualties, and death with scientific detachment, but implicitly paints a self-portrait of a humanitarian seek- ing justice for the disgrace wrought by history. [William K. Powers] Urbanization in the Middle East. V. F. Costello. London: Cambridge University</page><page sequence="5">BOOK NOTES 189 Press, 1977. ix + 121 pp. $11.50 (cloth), $3.95 (paper). The author, an urban geog- rapher, draws upon his fieldwork in Iran and on many recent, first-hand field studies from a diversity of disciplines, in all the area except the Maghrib. General cultural fea- tures, preindustrial cities, modern develop- ment, migration, social adjustment, stratifi- cation, and urban form are treated in separate chapters. He emphasizes the pri- macy of area-wide similarities over local differences and the pre-eminence of the state in affecting urban forms and changes. The writing is amply referenced, sometimes vivid. An excellent, up-to-date brief introduction to a subject generally neglected by anthro- pologists and urbanologists. [John Gulick] Middle Eastern Muslim Women Speak. Eliza- beth Warnock Fernea and Basima Qattan Bezirgan, eds. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1977. xxxvi + 402 pp. $16.95 (cloth). A valuable anthology of women's lives and creativity spanning more than a thousand years, many nationalities, and all social classes. Twenty-three selections, each sub- stantial and well documented, range from al-Khansa's 9th-century poem, "Lament for a Brother," through time to a statement (1970) by Ghadah al-Samman, Lebanese novelist, on "The Sexual Revolution and the Total Revolution." The rather heavy and bourgeois preoccupation with "sexual free- dom" is counterbalanced by pragmatic accounts of peasant women's lives, and by such lovely poems as the Tunisian lullabies; but the gems of the book are the autobio- graphical pages from the life of Umm Kal- thum, Egypt's great singer, and the inter- views with Algeria's legendary revolutionary heroine, Jamilah Buhrayd. [Louise Sweet] Bilingual Education: An International Socio- logical Perspective. Joshua A. Fishman. Appendix by E. Glyn Lewis. Rowley, Mass.: Newbury House, 1976. xiii + 208 pp. $6.95 (paper). A collection of articles that can be described as advocacy sociolinguistics. Fish- man asserts that bilingual education is good and should be encouraged for the well-being of majorities, minorities, teachers, and the world at large. Following four chapters of fast-paced prose, he sketches bilingual educa- tion in 110 countries and then reports on his own study aimed at finding out why some programs succeed. This book is designed to give quick, dramatically favorable answers to skeptical practitioners who wonder whether bilingual education is worth it or not. [Allan F. Burns] Work, Culture, and Society in Industrializing America: Essays in American Working-Class and Social History. Herbert G. Gutman. New York: Knopf, 1976. xiv + 359 pp. $12.50 (cloth). Diverse aspects of the social history of the working class in 19th-century Ameri- ca are explored in seven essays. Their sub- stance ranges beyond the traditional bounda- ries of labor historians by including dimen- sions of social class, mobility, race, ethnic customs, religion, violence, community, and personality. Specific topics examined in- clude Negro participation in the United Mine Workers; industrial development and strife in Paterson, New Jersey; violence in the 1870 railroad strikes; and community influence in the settlement of two lockouts in Pennsyl- vania. The cross-disciplinary implications of these essays should be of interest for those concerned with American society. [Solon T. Kimball ] Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Devel- opment of Stratification in South Africa. Robert Ross. African Studies, 21. London: Cambridge University Press, 1977. xiv + 194 pp. $13.95 (cloth). This short book captures the frontier conditions of the 19th century and brings to life the white frontiersman, Xhosa tribesman, San hunter, and KhoiKhoi herder. Ross sketches the intricate relations between Boer settlers, Griqua farmers, and Tswana, watched over by the British. There are interweaving references to the northward expansion of whites, economic development, British colonial policy, and indigenous social and political development. The discussion always returns to Griquatown and Kokstad, to Adam Kok and his people, to their struggle to maintain a hold on their land, liberty, and self-respect. A well organized, solidly researched and documented book of interest to specialists in southern Africa. [Brian du Toit] Identite culturelle et francophonie dans les Ameriques (I). Emile Snyder and Albert Valdman, eds. Publications of the Interna- tional Center for Research on Bilingualism, A-11. Quebec: Les Presses de l'Universite Laval, 1976. 290 pp. $18.00 (paper). These 18 papers examine French language realities in Canada, the United States, and the Antil- les. Four disciplinary approaches are seen: Sociolinguistics-Beauchemin and Corbeil (Quebec), Dugas (New England), C. Le- febvre, G. Lefebvre, and Valdman (Antilles); Education-Swain (Canada), Picard (New England), Bradley and Lobelle (Louisiana); Linguistics-Santerre (Quebec) and Morgan (Saint Martin); and Literature-Paquette and Moisan (Quebec), Glissan, Laroche, Racine,</page><page sequence="6">190 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978] and Howlett (Antilles). The collection is valuable to anthropologists for its des- criptions of the role of nonstandard French in education, government, and literature and for its insights into dialects as indicators of boundary demarcation and group identifica- tion. [Peter Woolfson] Culture Change and Modernization: Mini- Models and Case Studies. Louise S. Spindler. Basic Anthropology Units. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977. xiii + 177 pp. n.p. (paper). The author presents a "grand model" for the analysis of culture change at various levels of the sociocultural system. With this model as an integrating focus, "mini-models" or distinct processes of cul- ture change are discussed and illustrated with material from ethnographic case stud- ies. The mini-models include innovation, diffusion, acculturation, modernization- urbanization, and ecological and psycho- logical bases for culture change. An excellent introduction to the major themes and theo- ries concerning culture change and moderni- zation but a disappointment in that only perfunctory mention is made of the impor- tant and timely subject of applied social change. [Allyn Stearman] Les facettes de l'identite ambrindienne/The Patterns of "Amerindian" Identity: Sym- posium, Montmorency, October, 1974. Marc-Adelard Tremblay, ed. Quebec: Les Presses de l'Universite Laval, 1976. (Distri- bution by International Scholarly Book Ser- vice, Forest Grove, Oregon.) xiii + 316 pp. $16.50 (paper). Twelve papers and the tran- script of a round table discussion presented during a symposium on Canadian Indians sponsored by the Royal Society of Canada. Contributors are academicians from several Canadian universities, government officials, and Indians, plus D'Arcy McNickle. The topics include native leadership, politics, law and order, land claims, health, and housing. Participants offer interesting comparisons of Indian and French-Canadian integration. The value of the book is reduced by the publica- tion format. Symposium members benefited from simultaneous translation facilities, but the reader must know both English and French to understand fully what was said. There are French abstracts for the eight papers delivered in English, and English abstracts for the four in French; but there are no summaries of the discussions, nor of the closing remarks of editor Tremblay. Nevertheless, the book is a useful addition to the literature on contemporary Canadian Indian affairs. [James E. Officer] Physical Anthropology Growing Points in Ethology. P. P. G. Bate- son and R. A. Hinde, eds. London: Cam- bridge University Press, 1976. viii + 548 pp. $38.50 (cloth), $11.95 (paper). This volume includes essays from many noted students of ethology. The book is divided into four sections: motivation and perception, func- tion and evolution, development, and human social relationships. The first two sections discuss many of the theoretical approaches relevant to ethology. The third section cen- ters on the genetic basis of behavior and the development of behavioral patterns. Section Four provides discussion on human behav- ioral development. This section is concluded by a penetrating essay by Tinbergen, calling upon ethologists to concentrate upon solving problems that face mankind today. This book is an important contribution to the study of ethology. It raises many perplexing questions, questions which should provide the basis for new research, not only in ethology, but in related fields, as well. [Gregg Gunnell] Chromosome Variations in Human Evolu- tion. A. J. Boyce, ed. Symposia of the Society for the Study of Human Biology, 14. New York: Halsted (Wiley), London: Taylor and Francis, 1976. viii + 131 pp. $12.00 (cloth). This symposium volume of seven papers focuses on the role of altera- tions in chromosomal morphology and num- ber in human evolution. This new area of study is made possible by outstanding ad- vancements in cytologic techniques which are the subject of the first paper. Three papers discuss chromosome variation with respect to its possible sources, incidence and survival. The remaining three papers concern chromosome evolution in primates and the role of chromosomal changes in speciation. Indeed, one paper suggests that such chr- omosomal variation may shed new light on the mechanisms of evolution and has termed such studies as a new discipline, chro- mosomal phylogeny. Well written, well refer- enced, and useful to those interested in human evolution. [William J. Babler] Ecology and Evolution of Communities. Martin L. Cody and Jared M. Diamond, eds. Cambridge: Harvard University Press (Bel- knap), 1975. xii + 545 pp. $29.50 (cloth). Although the Lotka-Volterra equations that form the basis of theoretical ecology have been known for 50 years, it is only in the last 10 years that this field has assumed its rightful position as the foundation of bio-</page><page sequence="7">BOOK NOTES 191 logical science. Theoretical models are no longer regarded as idle speculation. This book consists of both general articles on the evolution and stability of communities and others on specific communities or ecosys- tems. The major problems are the stability of such systems and the maintenance of species diversity. Genetic evolution is the part of biological theory usually taught in anthropology courses and considered most relevant to the field, but ecological theory that concerns competition between popula- tions is more relevant to many aspects of human biological and cultural evolution. This is a good overview of the current status of ecological theory even if total compre- hension of many of the contributions re- quires considerable mathematical knowl- edge. [Frank B. Livingstone] Culture, Natality, and Family Planning. John F. Marshall and Steven Polgar, eds., Mono- graph 21. Chapel Hill: Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina, 1976. xiii + 301 pp. n.p. (paper). Fifteen articles, mostly by anthropologists, which would be of great use in courses in medical anthro- pology, applied anthropology, and to some extent in courses focusing on sex roles. The reader is divided into three parts: the first deals with childbearing and reproductive capacity in the context of kinship, house- hold organization, and economic activity. The second group examines programs for regulating population among tribal peoples, in the Third World and in California (the Fourth World?), and the third is on research methods in family planning. It is an inter- esting and sophisticated collection, and the article by Murray on Haitian folk medicine is outstanding. [Norma Diamond] Orthopedic Problems of the Wetherill Mesa Populations, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado. James S. Miles. Publications in Archeology, 7G. Washington: National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, 1975. xiii + 52 pp. $1.75 (paper). Miles, an orthopedist with an anthropological orienta- tion, presents a detailed description of the abnormalities and probable etiology for hu- man skeletal material collected by the Weth- erill Mesa Archeological Project, National Park Service. The individuals studied in- cluded 179 complete and 366 incomplete burials spanning the Pueblo I through Pueblo III periods. The etiologic categories utilized were disturbances of prenatal origin; of metabolism; and of growth, degenerative processes, infections, trauma, vascular le- sions, neurologic problems, neoplasia, and diseases of uncertain origin. It is emphasized that in any population represented only by osseous remains, the picture of health is incomplete, as many diseases do not affect bone. Unfortunately, the small sample size did not permit a study of change in disease through time which would have been inter- esting given the cultural and environmental fluctuations of the periods represented. The author concludes that this population was healthy, noting particularly the rarity of traumatic injury. [Clark Spencer Larsen] Reconstruction of Demographic Profiles from Ossuary Skeletal Samples: A Case Study from the Tidewater Potomac. Douglas H. Ubelaker. Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology, 18. Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press. xi + 79 pp. $2.25 (paper). This work represents a milestone in popula- tion reconstruction utilizing human skeletal remains. Samples collected from two Late Woodland ossuaries located in southern Maryland by T. Dale Stewart (Ossuary I, excavated 1951-1953) and Stewart and Ubelaker (Ossuary II, excavated 1971-1972) were used in reconstructing demographic profiles and population size. Ubelaker em- phasizes that accuracy is dependent upon sample completeness, archaeological associa- tion, chronological control, adequate assess- ment of sex and age at death, and proper demographic methodology. He presents con- vincing evidence that these prerequisites are met with his samples, potentially providing the most accurate assessment of population parameter estimates. This monograph is a well written, concise contribution to osteo- logical analysis. [Clark Spencer Larsen] Archaeology Maya Anthropomorphic Figurines from Jaina Island, Campeche. Christopher Corson. Studies in Mesoamerican Art, Archaeology and Ethnohistory, 1. John A. Graham, ed. Ramona, Calif.: Ballena, 1976. ii + 218 pp. $7.50 (paper). This work describes exca- vated Jaina figurines, proposes a seriation for them, and explores their geographical distri- bution. A review of the literature is in- cluded, and the work is coordinated with that of earlier writers. This is not the ultimate text on this very important facet of Maya art-more refinement and depth are still needed-but it is a useful step in that direction, and a must for the scholar work- ing with the Maya figurine corpus. [Eliza- beth P. Benson]</page><page sequence="8">192 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978] The Atlas of Early Man. Jacquetta Hawkes. New York: St. Martin's, 1976. 255 pp. $15.00 (cloth). Hawkes' goal is to tell us "what happened at the same time as what." Her summary charts and illustrations make the book a handy reference for comparing concurrent events. Unfortunately, the over- all coverage is not only superficial (she covers the whole world from 35,000 B.C. to 500 A.D.), but also lacking in continuity (the text skips from place to place and information is scattered among text and charts, which are sometimes redundant). Because of the format and Hawkes' emphasis on diffusion, the book gives little insight into process or causality. [Diane O. Bennett]</page></plain_text>
