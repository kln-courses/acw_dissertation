<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE COCKTAIL PARTY" A CRITICISM By I. T. QUIN (Mr. Quin here offers an analysis and criticism of a much discussed play. He does not expect to find all in ready agreement with what he has to say; for his criticism is based on his own personal views about the function and scope of art in general, and' of drama in particular. But all should find his remarks both interesting and thought-provoking.) THE Irish premi?re of T. S. Eliot's comedy, The Cocktail Party, presents an occasion for a review of this much-debated play. The present writer intends to regard the work exclusively as an abstract, dramatic and, perhaps, literary chef d* uvre, prescinding as much as possible from any actual stage presentation. Is the play a success? To answer we must split the question into two further questions and answer each separately: Is the play a satisfying and unified dramatic work for an audience? Is the play satisfying and unified in itself? The first question is the simpler to answer, though the value of the answer is not very great. Eliot's play, to my mind, is not a successful play for any audience. At the University College presenta tion in Newman House there was present an almost ideal audience, with cultured taste and theatrical sensibility. It was also a Christian audience, imbued with all the principles embodied within the play. And yet, in so far as I could judge, Eliot's theodicy left these few hundred souls frankly perplexed and somehow aware of a gross incongruity. True, the wit and incisiveness appealed to them, the powerful situations pleased and intrigued them. But the play as an entirety left them, if not completely non-plussed, at least (to coin a Wodehousian phrase) far from plussed. Now I cannot believe that a philosophic dramatist would find anywhere a similar group of people who would be more fit to pass judgment Save for Martian or angelic intellects, these are as good as the world provides in theatre audiences. Consequently, The Cocktail Party's failure with them can be universalized without injustice into a general failure. 259</page><page sequence="2">IRISH MONTHLY But the second question is the vital one. To answer it requires that we undertake an analysis of the work itself to discover the intrinsic cause of its lack of. success. For it is not a success as a drama?though at this point it must be conceded that it may be a great work in the realm of didactic and moral literature. Summarized, The Cocktail Party is an attempt to dramatize the inner conflict between man's boundless yearning for happiness and his very limited powers of attainment. In this strict sense the work is a comedy of frustration. Edward, Lavinia, Celia and Peter are four very enviable people. They are what are popularly called " successful " people, since they appear to have everything that wealth and position can give, without being handicapped by that super abundance of effects which is more wearisome than want. For simplicity's sake the dramatist has placed them in the ideal (though possibly unreal) situation of having no obstacles to the gratification of their hunger for felicity. Celia, a flaming fiercely-eager soul, loves passionately the stolid Edward, who finds himself glorified and renewed in this blaze of passion. Lavinia, Edward's disillusioned wife, goes away, leaving the lovers free. It is this sudden opportunity of making their dreams reality that actually shakes them out of their dream-world. Celia suddenly finds that she never has loved the real Edward; her own idealization of Edward was the true object of her desire. Edward, too, finds that Celia, the real Celia, can never be his because to accept her as his lover or his wife would reduce their relationship to the drab ordinariness of his life with Lavinia. Both discover that they are pursuing a dream; any attempt to make it real means its destruction. This infatuation with unreality is extended to include Lavinia and Peter, who, in their own way, are endeavouring to capture the will o'-the-wisp. This is a world, so like our own, where they find them selves "always on the verge of some marvellous experience", but like the waters from the lips of Tantalus, that margin moves as they move, yet never moves sufficiently to lose its urgent, imminent, im pending attraction. And so the scene is set, and into this world of complex but perfectly understandable psychological perplexity (still perfectly good theatre) comes Sir Henry Harcourt " One-Eyed " Reilly. Sir Henry is to prove the rub. As an eminent psycho-analyst we are not perturbed when he successfully reveals to these tortured men and 260</page><page sequence="3">" THE COCKTAIL PARTY " women the cause of their inner unrest. Only when he comes to assume the r?le of " ang?lus "-cum-professor-who-knows-all-the answers does our sense of artistic truth begin to protest. Still, we can endure his expounding to Lavinia and Edward the Christian synthesis on married sacramental life, with its "ceasing to regret", its "avoidance of excessive expectation", its loneliness mingled with communion, and its glorious reward of rapturously fulfilled desire. But when he speaks of " saints " and " sanatoria ", when he asks from Celia an utter and supreme renunciation of worldly happiness in return for an eternal beatitude, that sense of artistic propriety clamours aloud that it is being outraged. Such was my experience with this comedy. If I am to justify myself, an apparent digression must be introduced here. Drama is one of the arts and, as such, its lessons are not the explicit didac ticisms of the dramatis person? but the inner convictions that well up within the consciousness of the beholder. The truths of the players' words pass into our ears; the situations, as they reveal them selves, are absorbed by all our senses, but the moral resultant from all these, the great truths of their lives and actions are created by ourselves within. Now, Eliot's play fails fundamentally because its lesson is not expressed through art. Nothing that Celia, Lavinia, Edward or Peter do, say or neglect could excite within us sentiments and impressions in the least degree comparable to the world-shattering profundity of Reilly's diagnosis. Even the profoundest of aesthetic emotions cannot be interpreted as an act of faith. It is this infinite gulf that yawns between artistic and religious belief that has baulked the dramatist of success. In striving to arrive at the essence of Christian revelation by purely artistic means, Mr. Eliot has attempted the impossible. By-passing the conventional routes of ethics, moral and dogmatic theology, attempting to lead us direct to the heart of the matter, he has set us on a road that leads to nowhere. Let it be plainly understood that the end sought by Mr. Eliot in The Cocktail Party is wholly praiseworthy. But his efforts to propa gate the Gospel are misplaced. For, while admittedly the pulpit can learn much from theatrical effectiveness, this does not imply that the artistic approach to life and eternity can ever be a practical one, because art is a human function with human limitations, and drama as a branch of art is equally confined. The dramatist is fully justified 261</page><page sequence="4">IRISH MONTHLY in treating of human actions, good and evil, but he is not entitled to pursue these to a specified, definite eternal consequence. To venture into that transcendental realm of beatitude or damnation, wherein even our knowledge is but analogous, is to lay aside his artistic vocation and assume the new and more awe some r?le of prophet and evangelist. The eternal verities will allow of no artistic liberties. They are stern, unyielding, adamantine in their self-insistence. They are as changeless as God Himself, for Justice, Truth and Mercy as they emanate from God are but attributes and aspects of His Divine Transcendent Nature. What then are we to say of Celia and the others with their " divine " unsatiated hunger? Can we not treat of such a theme in drama? Most certainly we can, since such desire for happiness springs spontaneously from human nature?and human nature is the artist's arena and proper sphere. But man's natural yearning, unless supernaturalized by divine faith, is an inchoate longing, a reaching outward forever towards the indefinite and indefinable object called supreme felicity. But the definition and specification of that object of our longing is completely a revelation from outside. It is something that we acquire when we make our first act of faith, an act requiring the grace of God and our co-operation with that grace. Now, Mr. Eliot has overlooked such a distinction between man and Christian. He evidently assumes that if his art leads us along the path which his faith has mapped for him, we too will arrive with him at the desired goal. But he forgets that between himself and the thousands of Edwards and Celias who constitute his readers and his audience there is fixed a great gulf of faith which no man may cross unaided. This a priori argument is borne out in watching the play itself. We readily accept Eliot-Reilly as an analyser of human difficulties; but the metamorphosis into a prophet and pre cursor, signalled by the introduction of those peculiar sanatoria and still more curious valedictions, alienates our entire artistic sensibility. Up to this point we have followed eagerly in the bright daylight of Mr. Eliot's artistic genius. But when he beckons us to go forward into the darkness beyond we become aware that our confidence in him has disappeared, and we look around for some other light to dissipate the gloom. And if we have no faith, then we will not find such a light, and Eliot's solution to the problem will be but an empty mockery. In a word, the human ailments and their causes in this 262</page><page sequence="5">"THE COCKTAIL PARTY" play are legitimate themes for drama. Their ultimate perfect solution is a matter for belief, and this is a realm in which Mr. Eliot, and for that matter every other human man, is not competent to be our guide. Probably at this stage the reader is conjuring up situations from Dante and phrases from Milton, pondering on the problem of faith in art; it will be urged that Greek tragedy is preponderantly religious in theme and treatment. To do more than give a brief outline of the method of resolving these objections would require more space than is here available. It should, however, be noted that all success ful leligious drama requires an audience thoroughly permeated with the religious beliefs portrayed; so that the players merely reiterate the popular religious convictions. Moreover, the Olympian theocracy, being so definitely anthropomorphic, lent itself freely to dramatization. As for the pity and emotion of Aristotle's Poetics, these are not divine attributes but abstract human virtues. The success of Milton's Paradise Lost and Samson Agonist es is no more valid an objection to the views already advanced; for the Puritan poet's heavens, angels and devils are human almost to a ludicrous degree. Milton was an artistic master. Consequently he humanized eternity to make it successful art. But his success in the latter sphere is no argument for his veracity as a portrayer of the supernatural. Let it be stressed and noted here that Mr. Eliot attempted the very antithesis of Milton's work?his effort is to supernaturalize art to give a supernatural message. Anyone who is at all attentive to the condition of the world of our time will pardon the playwright his presumption. Men are in desperate need of a focus for their lives, and this was a praiseworthy effort to fill that need. Mr. Eliot's failure, too, is no reflection on his artistic ability, for it denotes solely that, though a supreme artist, he has not recognized the limitations of his own art. 263</page></plain_text>
