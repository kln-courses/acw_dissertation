The Reading of Ovid (Tyros), by Percy Wyndham Lewis. c.1920. Canvas, I65.1 by 88.9 cm. Purchased 1977. A series of works belonging to a brief period around 1920 was given the name 'Tyros' by Lewis and exhibited at the Leicester Galleries in August I92I. In his introduction to the catalogue Lewis wrote that they were for him 'a series of pictures coming under the head of satire; grotesque scenes ... of beings that will serve to synthesise the main comic ideas that attack me at the moment'. The Tyro was defined by Lewis as 'an elementary person, an elemental'. In a letter to the American collector John Quinn, he wrote that The Reading of Ovid 'is one of the paintings I took longest over, is very carefully painted . . . quite a satis- factory painting: it would make a good altar-piece'.
