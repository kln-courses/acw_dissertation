Professor J. H. Burnett as</page><page sequence="2">46P British Ecological Society Chairman of the first session, welcomed the Society to Newcastle and introduced the President, Professor J. L. Harper, who delivered the Presidential Address on 'A Darwinian Approach to Plant Ecology.' This has been printed in full in all three Journals. Following this session, Dr R. W. J. Keay took the chair to introduce a session on 'The Tropical Contribution to Ecology' with the following theme: Owing to the climatic conditions, the richness of the flora and fauna and the relatively large areas where disturbance by man is far less profound than in temperate regions, the tropics provide many unique situations for ecological study. The unfavourable season, where it exists, is dry rather than cold, and this situation has emphasized the importance of studying such matters as the water relations of plants, the influence of fires and the influence of high temperatures on animals. Study of the species-rich tropical rain forest has put in question the conventional concept of plant associations. The considerable extent of natural and semi-natural ecosystems in the tropics has led to wide recognition that ecology is relevant in many applied fields, such as medicine, land use, agriculture and forestry. The following papers (see abstracts below) were delivered as examples of the contributions to ecology being made in the tropics. (i) THE CONCEPT OF THE ASSOCIATION IN TROPICAL RAIN FOREST, by M. E. D. Poore, Nature Conservancy, London. Recent studies on Malayan Lowland Dipterocarp forest have implications for the concept of the association in tropical rain forest. These were carried out in Jengka Forest Reservation in central Malaya between 1962 and 1965. The area chosen was 1 km2 of forest, as nearly typical and uniform as possible, apparently unaffected by significant human influence and in an area where neither forest fires nor cyclones have been known to occur. It is not absolutely uniform but of undulated relief with a network of narrow swamps. Only canopy trees, effectively those over 3 ft (90 cm) in girth, were sampled. In an area of 23 ha, 2773 trees were recorded of 375 species and 139 genera. The species/area curve showed no sign of flattening as the sample area was enlarged. The forest has, apparently, a balanced age structure. The evidence for this is as follows. If the logarithm of the number of trees between 3 and 15 ft (90-460 cm) girth of all species is plotted in 1 ft girth classes, the result is a straight line. Its shape is determined by two measures: the rate of girth increment and the rate of death. Dawkins (1963) has shown that in natural rain forest, girth increment is generally independent of girth. This line therefore indicates a straight-line relationship between log number of trees and age, and consequently the rate of mortality is inversely proportional to age. The line for all trees is a resultant of lines of different slope for trees of different characteristics, e.g. Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Santiria (Burseraceae). Certain genera or species, however, do not show this balanced age structure, e.g. Diptero- carpus spp. and Koompassia malaccensis. In them there are many more trees of girths 6-10 ft than of smaller girth. This discrepancy is so great that it cannot be accounted for by differences with age in growth rates or death rates. The chances for establishment of these species must have been more favourable at some time in the past and the forest is therefore not completely in balance. The forest consists of groups of associated species (the less common) whose occurrence appears to be correlated with physical environmental features, e.g. impeded drainage, in a matrix of species (the more common), whose location is determined more by chances of dispersal and establishment than by their response to local differences in the physical environment. The evidence for this is derived from plots of the distribution of single species, pattern analysis and association analysis. Of the eighteen most common species some are greatly aggregated at various scales and others are distributed at random. The degree of aggregation seems to be related to the efficiency of fruit or seed dispersal. Analysis of the distribution maps suggests that the position of the groups of any species changes with time. No species is consistently positively or negatively associated with any other scales of pattern at all. This behaviour can be accounted for by the biology of flowering, fruiting and establishment. Many species fruit rarely; fruits remain viable for a very short time (commonly only 2 or 3 weeks); seedlings and saplings persist on the forest floor for periods of 7-10 years (or longer</page><page sequence="3">British Ecological Society 47P if of very shade tolerant species). They grow rapidly into the canopy during this period if shade is removed by the formation of a gap. The canopy composition depends, therefore, on two causally unrelated events, seedling establishment and the formation of a gap several years afterwards. Although in a small relatively uniform area the common species appear as though they were ecologically equivalent and there is thus no consistent relation between composition and habitat, nearby areas of different soils bear forests of entirely different composition. It is suggested by two separate lines of evidence that the average time between the formation of two successive gaps in this forest is between 200 and 300 years. The different proportions of species which are light- and shade-demanding as saplings and grow fast or slowly respectively may be due to the statistical probability of gaps forming after the lapse of a certain number of years. If gaps form frequently the proportion of fast-growing light-demanding species would be high; if rarely, there would be a high proportion of slow-growing species with shade tolerant saplings (c.f. Cousens 1965). Long-continued studies of undisturbed forests are necessary to study their dynamics. Cousens, J. E. (1965). Some reflections on the nature of Malayan lowland rain forest. Malay.

(ii) ENERGY AND WATER BALANCES OF VEGETATION IN THE TROPICS, by A. H. Bunting, Depart- ment of Agricultural Botany, University of Reading, and J. F. Elston, Institute for Agricultural Research, Samaru, Northern Nigeria. Walker (1957) suggested that between the equator and 150 N the calculated value of the weighted back radiation term of the Penman estimate of potential transpiration is similar in size, though opposite in direction, to the calculated aerodynamic term. The two terms are found to be similar in size at Kabanyolo (0?), Samaru (110 N) and Bloemfontein (29? S). Where this relation holds, it is possible to estimate potential transpiration from radiation and temperature data alone, without wind or humidity data. We have used measurements of solar radiation at sixteen stations in Africa (Quarterly Radiation Bulletin) and estimates of solar radiation from hours of bright sunshine from a regression (Davies 1965) for twelve stations in Northern Nigeria, together with mean temperatures, to estimate rates of potential transpiration in this way. Notional water deficits were calculated from the potential transpiration and the rainfall, and the periods of notional water surplus (ET&lt; P) were used to define the limits of the average growing seasons for crops. Radiation. Almost all the measurements of total solar radiation receipt were between 400 and 600 g cal cm- 2 day-'. Within 50 of the equator, monthly means did not vary very much from the annual mean of about 400 g cal cm- 2 day- 1. Further from the equator the seasonal variation was greater: at Samaru from 390 (August) to 580 g cal cm- 2 day-' (March) and at Bloemfontein from 310 (June) to 670 g cal cm- 2 day- ' (December). Potential transpiration. Near the equator the mean potential transpiration rate was about 4 mm day- ' and varied little with season. Further from the equator it varied more: at Samaru from 3 mm day-' (August) to 5 mm day-' (March) and at Bloemfontein from 2 mm day-' (June) to 6 mm day- 1 (December and January). Notional deficit. Rainfall varied very much more in amount, distribution and duration than radiation or potential transpiration at all the stations studied. Hence the size and course of the notional water deficit, and the length of the period when there is a surplus of water (growing season), varied widely. This is the main basis of seasonal variation in tropical climate. This was examined in detail for Nigeria, where a regular change in length of growing season with latitude is related to the sequence of vegetation zones from tropical rain forest to Sahel savanna (Keay 1953).

Langdale-Brown, Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Edinburgh. The drier tropics were defined as inter-tropical areas with a pronounced seasonal water deficit that support savanna, thicket or grassland. An extensive (5 000 000 miles2 (6 700 000 kM2) area of this type occurs in Africa between the humid forest zone and the semi-arid Steppe (Keay et al. 1959). It supports the majority of the human population south of the Sahara. There are numerous general accounts of the effects which different types of land use have had, or are supposed to have had, on the environment; but comparatively little critical work appears to have been done. One exception (Trapnell 1959) is an account of woodland burning experi- ments in Zambia. Nye &amp; Greenland (1960) have presented quantitative data on the chemical and microbiological effects of burning in the cycle of shifting cultivation but most of their data refer to the humid forest zone. Reference was made to studies of grazing regimes, fire intensity and rangeland successions, and also to the effects of the complete protection of game animals in National Parks (Buechner &amp; Dawkins 1961). Attention was drawn to the fact that some uses have a more profound effect than others, and that impartial assessments of these effects are necessary. Inventories of the biological resources-the forests, rangelands, wildlife and other economic plants and animals-have aided rural development. Ecological studies of the vegetation have been of great value in the interpretation and extrapolation of meteorological and soils data in the assessment of land capability. The essence of the ecological approach to land classification and assessment is its concern with inter-relationships (Trapnell &amp; Clothier 1937; Christian &amp; Stewart 1953; Phillips 1959). One of the problems of ecological vegetation surveys undertaken for land assessment purposes is the condition and status of the vegetation at the time of the survey. It would be insufficient merely to map the existing vegetation as this often does not reflect the nature of the physical environment. At the same time it is useful, for range manage- ment and other practical purposes, to produce a map of the contemporary vegetative cover. This problem was overcome in Uganda (Langdale-Brown, Osmaston &amp; Wilson 1964) by mapping the existing vegetation and gathering, systematically, information that enabled the relationships of each unit to be worked out. A second map was then produced to indicate the potential distributions of the main climax types. This second map was used as the framework for the assessments of land capability. The techniques employed were described and discussed. Studies of the feeding habits and population dynamics of individual species and the ecology of some natural and semi-natural ecosystems have indicated ways in which certain areas might be used to greater advantage. Morton Boyd (1965) has urged the production of management plans based on ecological, social and economic data for each of the National Parks of Uganda. Similar plans have been a feature of tropical forestry since the turn of the century, and they provide some of the best examples of applied ecology. It is significant that a high proportion of ecological research in the drier tropics has been sponsored by government departments concerned with agriculture, forestry or livestock production.

Dawkins, Department of Forestry, University of Oxford. There seems to be but one contribution from this activity to the science of ecology, namely the importance and method of recurrent rather than static studies, and the necessity for perma- nent, quantified observations easily located and perpetuated by succeeding workers. The greatest impediment to tropical ecology has not been its complexity, so tediously reiterated in the litera- ture, but the 'bus factor'. In a science that until recently was a civil service activity, the symbolic bus has operated either almost literally through tragedy (at least five outstanding botanists) or transfer, or figuratively through promotion, resignation or dismissal. Hence the lack of con- tinuity, the failure of research plans, the profusion of static and qualitative data capable of multifarious conflicting interpretation. Distribution and profile diagrams, frequency tables and species lists from temporary or indeterminate sites yield much speculation but few parameters measurable or predictable over time. For instance, it was static observation of healthy well- grown saplings of timber species free-standing in pleasant high-shade conditions, versus chaotic climber-thickets in the gaps, which led to most of the failures in early efforts at planting in forest. It had not been observed that appearance, however favourable, was no guarantee of vigour, nor that some canopy species can stagnate happily in the understorey for 30 years, nor that others can survive to dominate even the densest secondary thicket without silvicultural assistance, nor that acceptable vigour occurred only among plants standing in the full scorching sunlight so unfavourable to the ecologist's anthropomorphic musings. Among the failures were cautious canopy manipulations over the various techniques of under-, inter-, group-, line- and enrichment-planting, all seeking to favour the trees against the weeds, some of them of identical ecological preferences. Full light was denied partly because of vague fears of upsetting some sacred balance, but mainly because fully illuminated weed trees, shrubs and climbers are even more vigorous than the desirables. The problem could have (and now mostly has) been solved by patient, properly designed experiments over a decade or two; but our symbolic bus, assisted by a few die-hards with acute research phobia, often frustrated such invesiigations. The few studies which survive have forced us to drastic treatments, total removal of the canopy fully anticipating an explosive weed re-growth but employing it almost as an ally. In one of the most widespread successes, no attempt was made to establish a close crop, plants being confined to east-west parallel lines at or near final-crop spacing. Fast-growing, self-pruning, wide-crowned species are planted in polythene pots with careful timing to prevent delay in growth relative to the re-growth matrix. Easy linear access through the latter along planting lines allows frequent liberation of plants from marauding shrubs and climbers. Trees of the Musanga, Trema and Macaranga type are easily controlled by arboricides and do not reappear in the dense weed matrix. Hence, complete vertical exposure can be combined with lateral shading to produce clean stems of maximum height growth, eventually forming a closed crop, yet established initially over as little as 100% of the area. I can think of no recent work which better summarizes the African version of the method described than Catinot's 1965 papers, which discuss almost the whole ecological argument and the history of its development.

(Also available as a single bound reprint from Centre Technique Forestier Tropical, Nogent-sur-Marne, Seine, France.) (v) THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF FILARIASIS IN MALAYA, by T. Wilson, School of Tropical Medicine, University of Liverpool. Filariasis is the general name for infection with the filarial worms Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia (formerly Wuchereria) malayi. The adult worms live in the lymphatic system of man and cause a variety of lesions, for example elephantiasis, in a proportion of infected persons. The young worms, the microfilariae, circulate in the blood and are transmitted from person to person by mosquitoes, which must be of a species receptive to the development of the microfilariae through several stages to infective larvae. In Malaya, filariasis is mainly a disease of rural areas and is largely due to Brugia malayi. The mosquito vectors are one species of Anopheles and six species of Mansonia. All mosquitoes require water in which to breed, but Mansonia differ from most other mosquitoes in that the</page><page sequence="6">50P British Ecological Society larvae and pupae obtain their air supply by piercing the underwater roots of aquatic plants, instead of by coming to the water surface at intervals. The areas where filariasis occurs in Malaya are of two main topographical types, each with its characteristic mosquito fauna. One type is the coastal rice-field with patches of open swamp containing floating water plants such as water hyacinth or water lettuce and various grasses. These are the plants which provide the conditions needed by the larvae of the open-swamp Mansonia. The other type of endemic area is the fresh-water swamp forest bordering a large river. Here are found the swamp forest Mansonia; the larvae of these species attach themselves to the rootlets of trees, palms and creepers growing in the water. In one such area, long-tailed macaque monkeys had been found infected with microfilariae resembling Brugia malayi shortly before World War II. A Filariasis Research Unit of the Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, started full-time investigation of filariasis in 1953. Only after this date did it become clear that the previously known differences in terrain and in vector species were associated with different forms of the parasite. Two forms of B. malayi are now recognized. The adult worms appear identical, and there are only minor differences in the morphology of the microfilariae; the main differences between the two forms are biological. The periodic form is so named because the microfilariae in the peripheral blood show an almost completely nocturnal periodicity. This is the form found in man in the open-swamp areas. It develops readily in its natural vectors, Anopheles campestris and the open-swamp Mansonia, but develops scarcely at all in the swamp-forest Mansonia. Natural infections in animals are rare and experimental transmission to animals is difficult. This form appears to be the common one in other parts of Asia. The microfilariae of the sub-periodic form are present in the peripheral blood throughout most of the 24 h, with a minor peak at night. This is the form found in man and in a number of forest and domestic animals in the swamp-forest areas where animal infections with another Brugia (B. pahangi) are also common. It develops readily in its natural vectors, the swamp- forest Mansonia, and also in the open-swamp Mansonia, but only to a limited extent in anophe- lines. Experimental transmission to animals is readily achieved. The biting habits of the swamp- forest Mansonia support the belief that transmission of the sub-periodic form between animals and man occurs in this type of area. The sub-periodic form has so far been reported only from Malaya, Borneo and Palawan Island. These findings in Malaya have led to the discovery that animal infections with several species of Brugia occur in other countries, but no similar epidemiological situation, with transmission of infection from animals to man, has yet been confirmed elsewhere.

Most parts of the damp tropics are not particularly hot. In Southern Nigeria, for instance, temperatures above 300 C (86? F) are rare. The most characteristic feature of the climate is that, except up mountains, it is never cold. As a whole, tropical insects show few physiological adaptions to high temperatures. Most temperate-region insects have as high thermal death points, and can breed under as warm conditions. The main differences occur at the lower end of the temperature scale. Tropical insects go into chill coma at temperatures where temperate species are fully active. Many tropical insects are killed by quite short exposures to temperatures as high as 5? C (41? F). Although it is never cold in most tropical countries, temperatures do fall sufficiently to be harmful to many indigenous insects, though these temperatures would not inconvenience insects from cooler regions. There is some evidence that insect pests from temperate countries can invade the tropics successfully. If tropical species have any advantage in their normal</page><page sequence="7">British Ecological Society 51P environment, it is not usually revealed by studies of their temperature relations, and must be due to some other adaptation, e.g. to day length. (vii) THE TEMPORAL PATTERN OF SECONDARY PRODUCTIVITY IN THE TROPICS, by F. Bourliere, International Biological Programme, Paris. The tropical regions of the world are far more varied, ecologically speaking, than is commonly realized. The equatorial rain forest and the sub-desert thorn-bush have not much in common, except an average yearly temperature higher than that of the temperate regions. But 'averages' may be as misleading here as elsewhere. The much advertised richness of the flora and fauna characterizes only the wetter, generally forested, areas; and the same holds true for the reputed high rate of organic production which is apparently only found in some evergreen rain-forests and stands of grassy perennials. Recent quantitative studies, made in various parts of Africa, support the view that the major factor underlying the basic differences in the structure and productivity of the tropical ter- restrial animal communities is the seasonal pattern of primary production. In the rain-forest area (including derived grassy environments) food production goes on more or less continuously throughout the year. Hence the resident consumer populations are constantly kept at their maximum level (near the carrying capacity of the habitat). No seasonal food surpluses are left for long-range migrants and this fact probably accounts for the almost total lack of palearctic and nearctic migrants in the lowland rain forests of Africa, south-east Asia and tropical America. In undisturbed Guinea savannas, there are generally two short dry seasons and food pro- duction is limited to 8-10 months out of 12. Consequently the populations of small and large herbivores-which are mainly sedentary-show slight seasonal changes in numbers, which become sharper when the environment is altered by fire and/or overgrazing. The appearance of an unfavourable season apparently prevents the consumer populations from reaching their 'ecological ceiling' and leaves small seasonal food surpluses which are exploited by a few nomadic and/or long-range migrant species. In the thorn-bush belt (Sahel zone) food is produced only during the short rains which are restricted to 3 or 4 months of the year. The populations of resident consumers are therefore kept at a very low level by the scarcity of food during the long period of drought. These sparse populations are unable to use up all the food produced during the rains and leave an important seasonal surplus, which is thus able to support large populations of nomadic animals and long range migrants. The resident populations of animal consumers living permanently in tropical savannas as well as in boreal climates, seem to be unable to consume all the food locally produced, since the low carrying capacity of their environments during the critical stages of the yearly cycle keeps their population down. Migration and nomadism are therefore considered as an adaptation for the efficient utilization of seasonal food surpluses that sedentary species are unable to exploit entirely. This behaviour pattern probably originated at the tropical forest edge and its evolution was possibly speeded up by the sharp climatic changes of the Pleistocene period. (Viii) CIRCULATION IN TROPICAL LAKES IN RELATION TO PRODUCTIVITY, by L. C. Beadle, Depart- ment of Zoology, University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Apart from an external source of essential materials, the productivity of a lake in a temperate climate depends upon the seasonal cycle of summer stratification and winter overturn, whereby the nutrients derived from organic decomposition in the lower water are brought up again into the photosynthetic zone. This cycle is mainly determined by the large swing between summer and winter temperatures, which is of course not found in the tropics. Until recently, research on tropical lakes has not been continuous enough to give an adequate picture of regimes of circulation. From the work of Ruttner (1931) on lakes in Java and Sumatra it was clear that the tropical temperature regime is particularly conducive to stratification and to prolonged deoxygenation of the lower water of deep lakes. Since the productivity of some of these lakes was obviously quite high, it was supposed that a turnover must occasionally result from abnormally cold and violently windy weather. Subsequent work on African lakes has begun to show firstly that the extent to which a lake is stirred is determined by the degree to which it is exposed to winds. Depth in relation to surface B</page><page sequence="8">52P British Ecological Society area, shape and orientation of the basin and the surrounding topography, are important in this respect. Secondly, more continuous observations have disclosed a very distinct seasonal regime in several of the large lakes. This depends upon alternation between a relatively wet, calm period and a drier, windy season. In Lake Victoria, stratification is completely broken down by the heavy south-east trade winds in June-July and the stimulating effect of this on algal productivity has been observed and associated with the transport of nutrients to the surface (Fish 1957; Talling 1966). In the very large and deep Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi (Nyasa) most of the lower water (i.e. below 200-300 m) is permanently deoxygenated. But the upper part of this stagnant mass is regularly brought into circulation (and algal growth increases) by the south-east trade winds between May and August. Internal waves (seiches) play an important part in this mixing (Capart 1952; Coulter 1963; Harding 1963). At one extreme are the very shallow lakes, such as Lake George in Uganda, which are normally very frequently stirred by wind and are consequently very productive. At the other are some small relatively deep but very well protected lakes, e.g. the crater Lake Nkugute and the steep sided drowned river valley Lake Bunyoni in Uganda, which are apparently permanently stratified and deoxygenated below 10-20 m and are consequently very unproductive (Baxter et al. 1965; Beadle 1966). It is questionable whether they are deeply stirred on rare occasions of abnormally violent weather. A special case is Lake Kivu, a large and deep flooded river valley in the Eastern Congo which has a permanently stagnant and deoxygenated lower layer much denser than the overlying water through the influx of hightly saline waer. This acts as a permanent sink for nutrients and a considerable brake on productivity, seasonal stirring being confined to the upper layers (Damas 1937). There are other lakes showing intermediate conditions between those mentioned, but in general it may be said that in temperate lakes the trigger which sets off the spring outburst of production is increasing temperature and illumination, nutrients having previously been trans- ported to the surface by the winter overturn. In the tropics, on the other hand, temperature and illumination are always adequate, and production is stimulated by the upward movement of nutrients in windy periods. There are, however, many problems still unsolved. Baxter, R. M., Prosser, M. V., Talling, J. F. &amp; Wood, R. B. (1965). Stratification in tropical lakes at moderate altitudes (1500-2000 m). Limnol.

This departure from normal practice was necessary in order to accommodate the unusually large numbers of papers offered by members for this meeting.

C. Hutchinson, Department of Botany, University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Lime-chlorosis. Lime-chlorosis is a commonly observed physiological disorder of plants which grow on calcareous soils in Britain. Species differ markedly in their susceptibility to the condition (Grime &amp; Hutchinson 1967). One hundred and thirty-five species have been tested on a calcareous soil in the laboratory for their relative chlorosis-susceptibility. It has been found that, in general, species normally regarded as calcicoles do not show this condition, whilst species normally regarded as calcifuges develop a severe chlorosis (Hutchinson 1967). Seedlings of a number of these species have been raised in the field at a calcareous site. Sowings were made both in April, 1965 and 1966. Seedlings of Digitalis purpurea rapidly developed a severe chlorosis in both years, but only during August 1965 was there any large scale seedling failure, this being associated with a drought at the time. Failure was greatest on the south-facing slopes. No drought occurred during 1966 and no notable seedling failure occurred. By way of comparison, the seedlings of Hypericum pulchrum were green but equally small. These green seedlings, however, were able to survive the 1965 drought. It is suggested that the occurrence of lime- chlorosis may affect the drought susceptibility of seedlings. Both in the field and in the laboratory, chlorotic foliage is often desiccated under conditions in which there is not any desiccation of green foliage. The water relations of plants affected by lime-chlorosis have been studied by following the rates of water loss from fully turgid, detached leaves or shoots. Chlorotic leaves invariably lose water more rapidly than green leaves of the same species. The rate of water loss is related directly to the degree of chlorosis. The addition of chelated iron alleviates the chlorosis of species such as Deschampsia flexuosa and Digitalis purpurea. The green foliage produced loses its water less rapidly than the initial chlorotic leaves. When grown on a specific calcareous soil the rate of water loss from the shoots of four Hypericum species was related to the differing susceptibility of these species to lime-chlorosis. Following the technique described by Bannister (1964) it has been found that chlorotic leaves may lose water more rapidly than green leaves during both the stomatal and cuticular phases of transpiration, or during only one or the other. The experiments described are relevant to the rates of water loss from foliage during drought conditions but tell nothing of the ability of droughted foliage to recover from large leaf water deficits. Studies of the reversibility of leaf water deficits have shown that leaves affected by lime- chlorosis are less able to recover full turgidity than are green leaves with similar leaf water deficits. Plants which are liable to lime-chlorosis are thus likely to be at a disadvantage compared with chlorosis-resistant ones under drought conditions. Bannister, P. (1964).

Spence, Department of Botany, University of St. Andrews. While a study had been made at Makerere of the effect of water chemistry on macrophyte distribution, this talk was confined to factors controlling the distribution of species within given lakes. Examples of zonation (Cyperus papyrus, Phragmites, Potamogeton richardi, Nymphaea caerulea and (submerged) Potamogeton schweinfurthii, Chara-Hydrilla, Potamogeton pectinatus- Ceratophyllum (depth of water c. 3-6 m) were compared with data from many Scottish lochs (Spence 1964) where depth of water was correlated with distribution of dominants and certain growth forms. It was noted that, including these Scottish data and well-known data from the English lakes, there was no published evidence that the distribution of any macrophyte is significantly correlated with a circumscribed soil-type (Spence 1967). Light may control the overall depth range of a species, these limits being modified on par- ticular shores (a) by aspect which acts through factors (such as turbulence) that are not entirely depth-controlled, (b) by the nature of the species' response to these factors and (c) by available space. A study was made of germination in relation to light of P. schweinfurthii and P. richardi which grows in shallower water than the former. Germination occurs only after the fruit sinks and the soft parts of the drupe have rotted to expose endocarp and embryo. Sunk fruits rotted naturally in light may take several months longer to germinate than those that have their endo- carp exposed artificially. Experiments indicate that pericarp inhibition is physical, that daylight overcomes any after- ripening effects and that, exposure to light for 18 days of fruits which had been in dark for up to 4 months gave almost 100 % germination. Preliminary experiments with fruits that had been 3 months in the dark, and 'Cinemoid' filters, suggested red stimulus and far-red inhibition. Whilst awaiting the delivery of interference filters, gelatin-dye filters were made (Withrow &amp; Price 1953), and combined with appropriate 'Cinemoid' filters; thus 'Red' = Cinemoid R+ Orange G, cutting out above 710 m,u. Irradiation data were got by making and calibrating a 60-junction Solarimeter (Monteith 1959). With dark-rotted fruits, 50% germination by P. richardi needed more than four times the red-irradiation required by P. schweinfurthii; for similar fruits with embryo exposed (by removal of some endocarp in safe-light), the required irradiance was smaller and least in P. schweinfurthii. The relative red dosage per species is consistent with their distribution in nature. Thus P. richardi grows in water up to 1 m deep, usually in drainage ditches with fruits just buried in peaty flocculant; P. schweinfurthii rarely occurs in water less than 1 m deep, and dominates (in Lake Mutando) in water 6 m deep. Using broad-band pass filters, there is evidence that germination in P. schweinfurthii is better in red than other visible wavelengths. This too may make ecological sense since the turbid waters of Uganda at a few metres depth would tend to absorb red least of visible radiation (see Hutchinson 1957; Talling 1957 in Westlake 1966).

Walker, Department of Botany, Queen's University, Belfast. Samples were selected to cover the range of sites occupied by Juncus squarrosus in Northern Ireland. The vegetation of each sample was recorded in two ways. Firstly, in terms of species 'presence' in each of 100 sub-samples; secondly, in terms of the quantitative representation of all species in the whole sample. Each sample was tested for heterogeneity using the presence data and the method of association analysis (Williams &amp; Lambert 1959), and where necessary divided into homogeneous parts. For each homogeneous sample or part sample, eighteen</page><page sequence="11">British Ecological Society 55P environmental variables were estimated, and several plant performance parameters were re- corded. Each set of data was then regarded as multivariate. Various methods were used to simplify the multivariate data-principal component analysis (Kendal 1,957; Jeffers &amp; Boaler 1966); ordination techniques (Bray &amp; Curtis 1957; Austin &amp; Orloci 1966) and association analysis (Williams &amp; Lambert 1959). Comparisons of the results obtained from the different multivariate methods were made. The degree of correlation between the major components or axes of variation was examined. In- dividual environmental and performance variables were also examined in relation to the vegeta- tion components. The results indicated that mineral availability, sheep grazing and moisture regime are the main factors influencing the plant's behaviour. The results and conclusions were discussed in relation to the problem of studying the autecology of widespread plant species. Austin, M. P. &amp; Orloci, L. (1966). Geometric models in ecology. II.

(Xii) STUDIES OF THE STANDING CROP AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF MONTANE ECOSYSTEMS DOMINATED BY WOODY PERENNIALS, by David J. Bellamy, Peter J. Holland and Alan Whittick, Department of Botany, University of Durham. The validity of figures obtained from short-term studies of primary production and the dangers of using such figures in comparative work were discussed. The need for a method for obtaining an integrated figure which represents the 'level' of primary production over a long period was emphasized. A rapid method for obtaining such an integrated figure from standing crop data of ecosystems dominated by woody perennials was outlined. The results of such measurements in montane ecosystems of northern England and north-west Spain were presented and compared. The validity and importance of such estimates of primary production was discussed. (Xiii) SOIL MOISTURE TENSION IN RELATION TO PLANTS COLONIZING PIT HEAPS, by E. F. Greenwood, Department of Botany, The University, Newcastle upon Tyne. Most of the pit heaps in County Durham support some degree of plant cover about 30 years after the last tipping of shale (Richardson 1957). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that chemical factors did not often limit plant colonization although analyses showed that the pit shale was not rich in essential plant nutrients. For 15 months determinations of soil moisture tension were made at the surface, 1 in., 3 in. and 5 in. (2 5, 7 5 and 12 5 cm) levels at points situated half-way up the slope on the north-east, north-west, south-west and south-east sides of a conical heap The determinations were made by first measuring the moisture contents of the soils and then converting these values to pF units by means of a previously prepared calibration curve. The calibration curve, in which percentage moisture content was plotted against moisture tension, was constructed utilizing tensionmeter, pressure membrane and vapour pressure techniques (see Richards 1940, 1949; Schofield 1935). Values for moisture tension revealed that during the spring and summer months, periods of drought (pF above 4-2) occurred frequently at the surface on all aspects of the heap. On the north-east side of the heap, however, the duration and frequency of the drought was not so great and water was often available for plant growth in the zone between the surface and 3 in. (7 5 cm) below the surface. On all aspects of the heap when drought conditions prevailed in the surface layers a steep gradient existed from the surface, where pF values might exceed 6.0, to a depth of 5 in. (12 5 cm) where the pF values were mostly well below 4-2. During the autumn and winter months pF values below 4 2 were recorded at all depths and on all aspects of the heap. Maximum plant cover occurred on the north-east side of the heap and this was correlated</page><page sequence="12">56P British Ecological Society with the greater availability of water there. A particular example of this correlation was provided by results obtained from a weekly analysis of the percentage frequency of occurrence of Dactylis glomerata seedlings in a 1 m2 quadrat placed half-way up the north-west side of the heap. Germination of the seeds took place in the autumn and winter followed by a severe mortality of the seedlings in the drought conditions of early spring. Richards, L. A. (1940).

(xiv) THE USE OF TRITIATED WATER TO INVESTIGATE THE SPREAD OF PLANTS ON PIT HEAPS, by B. Pickersgill, Department of Botany, The University, Newcastle upon Tyne. Pit heap plants are exposed simultaneously to the harmful effects of soil and atmospheric drought which accompany high surface temperatures in late spring and summer. Because of the slope, aspect and colour of the shale, temperatures as high as 560 C may occur for several hours daily (Richardson 1958). However, provided the soil moisture is between wilting point and field capacity these high temperatures often only check growth without killing the plants. The possibility of additional water supplies (a) from the atmosphere, (b) from the soil, sufficient to ensure survival was examined with the aid of radioactive water. (a) Experiments were performed with Hieracium perpropinquum and H. pilosella, common pit heap plants in County Durham, under conditions of low moisture tension (e.g. R.H. = 95 %) at the leaves and high moisture tension (e.g. R.H. = 35 Y.) at the roots. When tritiated water was applied to the leaves as a liquid or a vapour an appreciable amount was absorbed by the leaves and conducted downwards in the stems to the roots (Monteith 1963). The ratio of the activity in the roots to that in the leaves increased as the medium around the roots became drier, i.e. as the vapour pressure gradient between leaves and roots increased. This effect was observed in mature plants and, more important for their survival on pit heaps, in seedling plants. (b) A widely-held view is that water absorption by plant roots occurs largely in the unsuberized region behind the root cap where the root hairs are formed (Kramer &amp; Bullock 1966). This region of roots may amount to only 1 % of the total root surface. Experiments with Hierecium spp. and Calluna vulgaris showed that tritiated water was absorbed by suberized portions of roots, conducted to the xylem and transported in the direction of the transpiration stream. This evidence supports the view that light rainfall which does not wet the soil down to the root tip region may nevertheless be absorbed by roots. Kramer, P. J. &amp; Bullock, H. C. (1966).

(xv) BRYOPHYTES AS INDICATORS OF AIR POLLUTION, by 0. L. Gilbert, Department of Botany, University of Newcastle upon Tyne. The deterioration of the bryophyte flora around Newcastle upon Tyne has been examined and a few simple experiments carried out to explain the phenomena. Newcastle being an isolated conurbation surrounded by open country has proved very convenient for these studies. The changing flora of certain widespread and uniform habitats such as asbestos roofs, sandstone walls and grassland was examined on a transect approaching the city centre from a point 10 miles (16 km) to the west. The majority of these species disappear in the outer suburbs or before they are reached. A small very constant assemblage is found in the town centre. It comprises Ceratodon purpureus, Bryum capillare, B. argenteum, Tortula muralis, Funaria hygrometrica, Leptobryumpyriforme, and restricted to grassland are Brachythecium rutabulum and Eurhynchium praelongum. A few others are known from the central area, all very rare and all restricted to niches with a high pH and a constant supply of water. It was established that terricolous</page><page sequence="13">British Ecological Society 57P bryophytes partially recover in sites sheltered by a combination of topography, trees and tall herbage. Detailed mapping of Grimmia pulvinata has indicated that the bryophyte desert north of the Tyne covers 130 square miles (340 km2), a tongue extending up the coast to include most of the coalfield. For various reasons, which include the shape of the affected area and the rapid death of bryphytes transplanted into the city, it was decided that air pollution was responsible. Newcastle has a fairly simple mosaic pattern of air pollution well monitored by continuous recording gauges. Studies here, and around isolated industries in rural areas elsewhere, have highlighted sulphur dioxide as the harmful pollutant. Bryophytes are also sensitive to fluorine in the air, but not in the quantities present over Newcastle. Most bryphytes cannot exist when the average winter concentration of SO2 exceeds 50 yig/m3 air or 0 01 ppm. Extreme shelter was found to reduce levels of SO, markedly but had less effect on smoke. Work has recently been started on the problem of why certain species are susceptible and others resistant. When growing at the same site both contain comparable amounts of sulphur. Up to 10 000 ppm of sulphur has been found in the tissues of resistant species growing in the city centre, while at the moment it appears that sensitive species at their inner limits never contain more than 4000 ppm. The answer would not seem to lie in the resistant species possessing a poor mechanism for sulphur accumulation. (xvi) THE LATE-AND POST-GLACIAL VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT ON SANDSTONE AND LIMESTONE AT KILLARNEY, Co. KERRY, by Elizabeth Vokes, School of Botany, Trinity College, Dublin. Killarney, in south-west Ireland, is situated in a sheltered valley surrounded by some of the highest mountains in Ireland. The countryside is still extensively wooded and there is historic evidence that some areas have remained undisturbed; therefore the pollen diagrams should record the natural development of the vegetation. The major rock type in the area is Old Red Sandstone on which is found the Killarney oak- woods such as are described by Turner &amp; Watt (1939) in their classic paper, but there is a small area of Carboniferous Limestone where there are Taxus baccata woods. The development of the vegetation on the two rock types was studied by pollen analysis of sediments from blanket bog in the two areas. It was hoped to be able to see if the development of the vegetation was different on the two rock types. Generally it is thought that pollen analysis only indicates the regional development of the vegetation but the diagrams from Killarney suggest that some synecological information can be obtained. In the Late-glacial there is the tripartite sequence usual in Ireland of Rumex-Salix-Empetrum to Betula-Juniperus-Gramineae to Cyperaceae-Caryophyllaceae with silty sediments. The Betula-Juniperus-Gramineae assemblage corresponds to the Aller0d of Denmark. The per- centages of Betula and Juniperus pollen are unusually high and suggest woodland or scrub in the protected Killarney valley. The development of the vegetation at Killarney is of greater interest in the Post-glacial because here it shows marked differences from the rest of Ireland. During the early Post-glacial there is the development usual in Ireland of Juniperus, Betula and Corylus scrub as the vegetation becomes progressively more closed. On the limestone the latter was replaced by mixed Pinus- Quercus woods with a little Taxus and Ulmus but on the Old Red Sandstone there was a succession of Betula-Quercus to Pinus-Quercus. For the major part of the Post-glacial, Pinus dominated the pollen diagrams, falling sharply probably at about A.D. 300. As yet there are no radiocarbon dates from Killarney but in com- parison with a site in Co. Clare, the pine fall probably took place at about this date. The reason for its sudden disappearance and probable extinction is mysterious but the pollen diagrams suggest that it was in some way related to the accelerated development of blanket bog peats. At the time of the pine fall, vegetation similar to that found today started to evolve with Taxus woods on limestone and Quercus-Betula on sandstone. Isolated tetrads of Arbutus unedo pollen were found after the initial rise of Alnus pollen, suggesting that it had been present in the Killarney area not much later than 4000 B.C. The development of the vegetation differs from most of Ireland in the very high prolonged values of Pinus pollen, the low values of Ulmus and finally the fact that the pollen diagrams are</page><page sequence="14">58P British Ecological Society uninterrupted by short-term rises of weed pollen, probably because of very limited local agri- cultural activity.

(xvii) THE INFLUENCE OF DEER GRAZING ON THE FLORA OF THE ISLANDS OF LOCH SIONASCAIG, WESTER Ross, by K. R. Ashby, Department of Zoology, University of Durham. In spite of its ecological importance, there are few published studies describing the detailed effects of wild grazing mammals, and that of Farrow (1925) on the effects of rabbits still has few equals. King &amp; Nicholson (1964) comment on the lack of critical studies on deer grazing. The present reconnaissance study, undertaken with the help of G. White and a number of under- graduates, was done on sixteen islands on Loch Sionascaig in the Inverpolly Nature Reserve, which form a long-term natural experiment on the effects of varying intensities of deer grazing. The flora of two of the most heavily grazed of these islands has been referred to by McVean (1958). Red deer find the biggest island of Loch Sionascaig (Eilean Mor) attractive and swim to it via certain of the other islands. A variety of indices of deer abundance, including their paths, drop- pings, hair, scrapes, wallows, fraying, gnawing of skeletal remains and the abundance of ticks indicate a very high index of deer occupation of Eilean Mor, a high index on two nearby islands, moderate on a third and low or negligible on the remainder. These differences are associated with major differences in the vegetation on the various classes of island, which are not related to characteristics of the bed-rock or degree of exposure to wind. Where grazing is absent or light, tall Calluna, associated with other dwarf shrubs and various species of Sphagnum, is dominant. Small Betula pubescens, Sorbus aucuparia and Salix spp. occur, particularly in sheltered spots, but there is nothing approaching a canopy. Pteridium is markedly subordinate to Calluna and Juniperus communis ssp. nana occurs frequently. On the moderately grazed island, Calluna is less completely dominant, Juniperus absent and Sphagnum sp. much less prominent, while, for example, the frequency of Molinia caerulea is much increased. Betula has been spreading for the past 20 years on this island and locally forms a closed canopy. On the three heavily and very heavily grazed islands there is a variable canopy of Betula with some Sorbus, the trees being from about 50 to 80 years old. There is an abundance of seedlings on the more open sections, particularly of the two smaller islands, but grazing limits them to a height of 8 cm. With increasing grazing pressure Calluna, Erica cinerea and Vaccinium vitis-idaea decrease in vigour, and are finally eliminated even where shading is completely absent. A grazed carpet of V. myrtillus and Deschampsia flexuosa is widespread where grazing is fairly heavy, but on Eilean Mor these plants in turn become subordinate, and their place is taken by Pteridium which is locally luxuriant, and such plants as Oxalis acetosella, Rumex acetosa, Potentilla erecta and Primula vulgaris, which are absent or infrequent elsewhere. Among the bryophytes notable features include the rarity of Sphagnum and the appearance of Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus and Polytrichum commune as abundant species. The usual description of the climax vegetation of lowland areas of Scotland being originally closed woodlands thus appears not to apply on the Lewisian rocks of north-west Scotland, except where conditions are made unusually favourable by such factors as good drainage and shelter from the wind as on the valley sides, and also, it would appear, by moderately heavy deer grazing. This conclusion is supported by the earliest available maps of the district. The climax vegetation would appear generally to have been dwarf shrub heath with scattered trees. Grazing, by reducing the competition from Calluna and perhaps also by raising the nutrient status of the soil, can permit the formation of closed woodland under such conditions, and this woodland would regenerate wherever large gaps appear in the canopy. Apparently, since 1900, an increase in grazing pressure has prevented the continuous regeneration of woodland on the most heavily grazed islands, but has made conditions favourable for woodland formation on the island which is now moderately grazed. In view of the low rate of deer stocking of the reserve, this increased grazing pressure on the islands may perhaps be attributed to repeated burning of the mainland reducing its nutrient status and destroying cover for deer, thus making the islands relatively more attractive.</page><page sequence="15">British Ecological Society 59P Farrow, E.

(xviii) ERUPTIVE DISPERSAL, MORTALITY AND RECRUITMENT OF A SHAG (Phalacrocorax aristotelis (L.)) POPULATION, by G. R. Potts, Department of Zoology, University of Durham. Much of the recent controversy concerning population regulation stems from an inadequate knowledge of mortality. This is particularly true in discussions of deferred maturity in the higher vertebrates. The study concerns the shag population of eastern Britain, particularly that on the Farne Islands, Northumberland. The causes of mortality are considered and survival is related to age and breeding ability. The survival of the breeding adults was found to increase with increased breeding success, higher survival being found in those adults which rear the maximum number of young. It follows that the stress involved in rearing young does not increase the susceptibility of the adults to mortality. The shags most susceptible to mortality are those in their first year, followed, in order, by inexperienced adults, poor quality adults, good quality females, good quality males. Birds older than 1 year are buffered from most of the annual variation in mortality rate. The eruptions of the population are intimately related to variations in the mortality rate. This, and geographical variation in the timing of mortality, suggests that starvation is the primary cause of the extra mortality suffered in eruptive years; the average weight lost before dying was 25 %. On the other hand, there is no correlation between mortality rate and size of the population, so that density dependent competition for food does not occur. The number of individuals available for recruitment varies according to the first year mortality rate. The number of 2-year-old males recruited is, however, a constant proportion of the total breeding stock, so that the individuals in cohorts with a high first year mortality defer their age of first breeding. (xix) THE EFFECTS OF HIGH NESTING DENSITIES ON THE CLUTCH SIZE OF THE COMMON EIDER Somateria mollissima (L.), by I. K. Marshall, Department of Zoology, University of Durham. The eider duck (Somateria mollissima (L.)) breeds at considerably different densities. In some areas, the birds breed in isolation whilst elsewhere they breed at high densities of up to 100 birds/ac (250/ha). This study has been made on the Farne Islands, Northumberlknd, where high breeding densities occur and particular attention has been paid to the effects of crowding. The mean clutch size of the eider is clearly related to the overall nest density, larger clutches being laid in high density areas. The mean clutch size ranges from 4 30 at low densities to 5 23 where there are at least six other nests within a 10 ft (3 m) radius. Further analyses of the field data show that it is primarily the early breeders which show this density effect. Birds which lay late in the breeding season do not show a difference according to the ultimate density. The correlation between density and clutch size only applies when all the birds have laid, that is, when using the ultimate density. There is no correlation between clutch size and the density at the time when the clutch is started, so it would appear that the birds anticipate the density of their nest site. This effect is caused by multiple laying by the early breeding birds and possibly by a form of social stimulation. In contrast to this clutch size effect, the hatching success decreases with nest density and the overall effect is that ducks breeding at high densities produce fewer ducklings per nest than at low densities. (XX) PREDATION ON TRICLADS, by R. W. Davies and T. B. Reynoldson, Department of Zoology, University College of North Wales, Bangor. An hypothesis explaining the distribution and abundance of the four common lake-dwelling species of triclad (Reynoldson 1966) was based on inter- and intra-specific competition for food. This assumed on laboratory evidence that predation on triclads was slight. The actual incidence</page><page sequence="16">60P British Ecological Society and intensity of predation in the field and the possible influence on competition in triclads was studied by means of a serological technique. Four rabbit anti-triclad sera, one against each species of triclad, were prepared by the injection of proteins precipitated upon potash alum (Proom 1943). Initial cross-reactions were absorbed out by the addition of frozen-dried triclad tissue of the requisite species. Specific antisera against Polycelis nigra Dendrocoelum lacteum and Dugesia lugubris were thus obtained. Loss of sensitivity during absorption prevented the preparation of a specific antiserum against Polycelis tenuis; therefore an anti-P. tenuis serum which retained sensitivity but cross-reacted with P. nigra was used. Of the 8000 animals (from seventy-five species) tested from the field only fifteen species gave a positive precipitin reaction showing that triclads had been eaten. These included the leech Erpobdella octoculata; five species of Odonata larvae; the Trichopteran larvae, Polycentropus flavomaculatus and Rhyacophila sp.; the newts, Triturus helveticus and T. cristatus; and the fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Pygosteus pungitus, Perca fluviatilis, Rutilus rutilus and Scardinius erythropthalmus. Knowing the number of predators which gave a positive precipitin reaction, the size of the predator population, the period a triclad meal can be detected for and the number of triclads eaten in the detection period, the number of triclads consumed in 1 month can be calculated. The annual effect of predation can then be determined by subtracting each month the number of triclads eaten and, adding, for the appropriate months, the number of young produced at known rates of recruitment. These assessments showed that singly none of the species of predator would reduce the triclad population below the level at which competition for food operates. Apart from Erpobdella octoculata and Polycentropus flavomaculatus, which live on stony shores, the other species of predator are more typical of weeded habitats. Calculations on the effect of predation on triclad populations on stony shores agreed with the evidence from a study of the changes in triclad size structure that competition for food operated as a density governing factor (Taylor &amp; Reynold- son 1962). The effect of concurrent predation by several species was studied in a small weeded pond in Snowdonia containing large populations of potential predators but no triclads. Triclads of all four species of known size and number were introduced into the pond. All species of potential predators were sampled at daily intervals and a thorough search made of the vegetation for triclads. Positive reactions were obtained from the damsel-fly Pyrrhosoma nymphula and Triturus helveticus. Ten days after introduction of the triclads all smears of predators proved negative and no further triclads were discovered. Triclads kept in cages in the pond as controls were alive and healthy and thus it was concluded that the triclad population had been eliminated or reduced to a very low level by predation. By comparison of the known number of positive precipitin reactions recorded against each triclad species and the expected number calculated from the relative proportion of the triclad species present, it was shown that Erpobdella octoculata exhibited a preference for the planariid species over Dendrocoelum lacteum and that damsel-fly larvae showed an apparent preference for the Polycelis species over Dendrocoelum lacteum and Dugesia lugubris. The apparent species preference exhibited by the damsel-fly larvae was shown to be due to a size preference for small triclads. The influence of selective predation was shown to have little influence on the distribution and abundance of triclads except perhaps in marginal situations. Proom, H. (1943).

(XXi) QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FEEDING STUDIES ON SOIL AMOEBAE, by 0. W. Heal, The Nature Conservancy, Merlewood Research Station. The present paper describes some studies to find the part played by protozoa in soil. Previous</page><page sequence="17">British Ecological Society 61P work has shown that amoebae feed readily on bacteria, but it is not known if other microflora are consumed. A series of experiments were made in which a number of small soil amoebae were offered a range of pure strains of soil microflora on agar plates. A wide range of bacteria, Nocardia, Mycobacterium and yeasts supported reproduction of these amoebae while algae, mycelial fungi and Streptomyces were inedible or only slightly edible. The factors influencing edibility, e.g. size, shape, capsule or filament formation, resistant cell walls, pigment production and exudates, were not discussed. There was little variation in the feeding habits between a num- ber of amoebae maintained in axenic culture over many years and amoebae recently isolated from soil. The study was extended to find the amount of food consumed by an amoeba at different reproductive rates. Acanthamoeba was fed on a convenient food source, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a non-nutrient liquid medium. This reduced reproduction of the yeasts. The number of amoebae and yeasts present at time 0 and after 24 h was estimated by a haemocytometer, the difference in number giving the numbers of amoebae produced and the numbers of yeasts consumed. Approxi- mately fifty experimental flasks were examined, the amount of food available per amoeba being varied. The results showed that when small amounts of food were available (up to 200 yeasts/amoeba) the food intake is linearly related to the food available. When more food was available ingestion rate was very erratic. This may result from changing conditions within the flask, such as shortage of oxygen. The reproductive rate was directly related to the amount of food consumed up to a level of about 2 4 generations per day. At this level the reproductive rate remained fairly constant over a wide range of food consumption. From these results the number of yeasts consumed for each amoeba produced can be calcu- lated. When this is plotted against the reproductive rate it is seen that the food consumption per amoeba produced remains roughly constant, with a mean and standard error of 40.1 ?7 9 yeasts. From these data it is possible to calculate the efficiency of conversion of food ingested to protoplasm. Dry weights of mass cultures of amoebae and yeasts were obtained and using the above figures a gross growth efliciency of 37 % was calculated. This is a high efficiency compared with other organisms but it should be remembered that the cultures are actively growing, that there is no difference between growth of the individual and the laying down of reproductive material, and that rapidly growing organisms tend to have higher growth efficiency than do slow growing organisms. Respiration studies on this amoeba have been carried out by R. J. Neff and using his mean figure of 8.4 p C02/h/106 amoebae, the amount of yeast required to maintain the respiration can be estimated. This has been done for a reproductive rate of one generation per day and from this respiration figure and the growth figures obtained above the following figures were obtained: Ingestion = growth + respiration + egestion 100 = 37+21+42 Thus the assimilation rate is 58 % and of the assimilated material 63 % is used for growth and 37 % for respiration. It should be recognized that respiration rates measured so far for the small soil amoebae are very variable, even when the amoebae are from the same sub-culture. An independent assessment of the amount of food consumed has been obtained by direct observa- tions of amoebae feeding on yeasts on an agar surface. These observations, although small in number, confirm the high conversion rate of the amoebae. (XXii) OBSERVATIONS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF Fabricia sabella (EHR.), (ANNELIDA, POLYCHAETA) ON THE NORTHUMBERLAND COAST, by D. B. Lewis, Department of Biology, Queen Elizabeth College, University of London. The polychaete Fabricia sabella is almost world-wide in its distribution (Rullier 1954; Banse 1956). It occurs mainly in the littoral zone and in particular in sheltered areas in silt or sandy deposits. Chapman (1955) and Colman (1940), however, have recorded large population densities occurring in exposed situations. In sheltered areas on the south Northumberland coast, populations in excess of 1 000 000/m2 occur in silt and sand trapped by the alga Rhodochorton sp. On exposed headlands on this</page><page sequence="18">62P British Ecological Society coast, similar population densities occur in sediments bound by 'seed' mussels or within the vertical plates of dead barnacles. Fabricia is a suspension feeder which ingests particles of approx. 2 ,i. It is possible that it digests bacteria or other micro-organisms adsorbed to the surface of the particles. Fabricia and the closely related species Manayunkia aestuarina (Bourne) occur in large population densities in the intertidal mud-flats of the river Blyth. The two species do not compete for food as they occupy different niches; Fabricia is a suspension feeder while Manayunkia is a deposit and secondary suspension feeder. Mats of Rhodochorton-silt become unstable and are removed from the rock by wave-action. Re-colonization of the rock surface occurs and the silt and sand particles trapped by the alga are colonized by Fabricia. The eggs and larvae of Fabricia are brooded in the tube of the female, development is direct, and there is no planktonic phase (Lewis 1961). Re-colonization is affected by post-larval and adult worms. Unlike many of the large sabellids, e.g. Sabella pavonina, Fabricia is able to leave its tube, crawl about on the surface of the substratum and construct a new tube. When the unstable sand containing Fabricia is removed from the rock, the disorientation stimulates the worms to vacate their tubes. Worms which are thus freed from their tubes attach themselves to rocks or algal fronds by means of the pygidium. Reactions to light and gravity result in the worms crawling onto horizontal surfaces. Before burrowing into the substratum and constructing new tubes the majority crawl at random over the surface secreting mucous threads, which help to consolidate the silt. Experimental evidence suggests that the particle size of the substrate is not critical. Banse, K. (1956).

(xxiii) DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE IN INSECT COMMUNITIES, by W. W. Murdoch, Department of Biological Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara. In two summers, samples of the plants and Homoptera were taken from three old fields in Michigan, U.S.A. The data have been used to examine the relationship between various aspects of diversity in the plants and Homoptera, and the effect of sample size on these relationships. The degree of correlation between Homopteran and plant diversity seems to change with sample size. The diversity indices used are those based on Information Theory and the results have been used to examine the indices' behaviour under different conditions. (xxiv) THE ENERGY BUDGET AND NITROGEN TURNOVER OF A POPULATION OF Gammarus pulex IN A SMALL WOODLAND STREAM, by C. P. Mathews, Department of Zoology, University of Reading. Field experiments were conducted on the disappearance of hard leaf (oak) and soft leaf (ash, elm, sycamore) litter in a small woodland stream. The disappearance of litter in the presence and absence of the chief constituent of the fauna, Gammarus pulex was estimated. The results showed that, at most, 13 % of the total litter presentcould have beencaused to disappearby G.pulex. The nitrogen production and population metabolism of G. pulex were estimated. The nitrogen production was found to be significantly greater than the total nitrogen available from the litter. This suggested that G. pulex browses on micro-organisms, these being the primary consumers of the litter and the chief cause of its disappearance. The summer mortality of G. pulex was significantly higher than the winter mortality; the possibility that the population growth of G. pulex was limited by food in the summer, in this habitat, was discussed. THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The 48th Annual General Meeting began at 9.30 a.m. on Friday, 6 January 1967. The following are the (unconfirmed) minutes of this meeting.</page><page sequence="19">British Ecological Society 63P MINUTES OF THE 48TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The President, Professor J. L. Harper, took the Chair in the Zoology Lecture Theatre, University of Newcastle upon Tyne at 9.30 a.m. on Friday, 6 January 1967. (1) The minutes of the 47th Annual General Meeting having appeared in J. Ecol. 54 (3), in J. Anim. Ecol. 35 (3) and J. appl. Ecol. 3 (2), were taken as read and approved. (2) The following report of the Honorary Secretaries was presented for discussion by the members present. Meetings Three meetings were held during the year by the Society and the Tropical Group met twice, on 29 March and 2 November. The 47th Annual General Meeting was held on Tuesday, 4 January, during the Winter Meeting at Goldsmith's College, London. An account of the Proceedings has been published in J. Ecol. 54 (3), J. Anim. Ecol. 35 (3) and J. appl. Ecol. 3 (2). The Society is very grateful to the Warden, Dr D. R. Chesterman; to the Delegacy and especially to the local organizer, Mr T. K. Rees. The spring Symposium on 'The Teaching of Ecology' was also held at Goldsmiths' College from 13 to 16 April. About 400 participants from schools, training colleges, universities and research stations made this one of the largest gatherings ever organized by the Society. The first group of papers dealt with basic problems in teaching ecology and its relationships with other earth sciences and medicine. This was followed by a series of papers examining the teaching of ecology in schools and in undergraduate and postgraduate university courses. The value of both the quantitative-experimental and the descriptive approach was examined by several speakers. Other sessions of papers dealt with current ideas and problems in the teaching of ecology abroad and the provision of field study facilities and centres in the United Kingdom. A group of papers also presented valuable information on career opportunities at home and overseas and the future trends in the employment of ecologists for specific problems, such as environmental planning and resource development which are becoming increasingly important subjects. A final session consisted of a lively and informative discussion forum when a panel of ecologists answeyed questions put to them by participants. The organizers, Dr J. M. Lambert, Professor J. L. Harper, Mr C. A. Sinker, Mr T. K. Rees and Dr D. J. Williams, were congratu- lated on a most stimulating and successful meeting. The summer excursion meeting was held from 4 to 8 July in Wester Ross, centred on the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve. Over forty members assembled at Kinlochewe on the evening of 4 July and were welcomed by the organizers, Dr J. Morton Boyd and Dr R. E. C. Ferreira. The following morning, the party visited the site of Coille na Glas-leitire, one of the well-known relict stands of Scots pine on the Torridonian Sandstone cliffs by the shores of Loch Maree. A long-term experiment in Scots pine regeneration was demonstrated on the moorland below the pinewood. In the afternoon, the party visited Rassal Wood National Nature Reserve, a high-level ash woodland situated on the southern outcrop of the Durness (Cambrian) limestone, where the effects of excluding deer and sheep grazing were seen. On 6 July, the party formed three groups for an ascent of Beinn Eighe, each taking routes of varying severity. The weather proved to be ideal and provided a rare opportunity to see the many ecological and geological features peculiar to this fine nature reserve. An oakwood on the eastern shore of Loch Shieldaig was visited during the morning of 7 July and some of the party spent a wet afternoon on a slightly calcareous dune formation at Big Sand near Gairloch. On the final day, the main party visited Meall Chiubhais where the vegetational changes from dolomite Fucoid Beds to the Cambrian Quartzites were demonstrated. In the evening many members took part in a lively and valuable discussion on wildlife conservation, introduced by Dr Morton Boyd. The Society is very grateful to the Scottish office of the Nature Conservancy and especially to the local organizers, Dr J. Morton Boyd and Dr R. E. C. Ferreira. The Tropical Group meetings both concerned themes associated with the International Biological Programme and were held in the rooms of the Linnean Society. The March meeting on 'Productivity of Tropical Ecosystems' was attended by about eighty members including guests from overseas. Dr J. F. Talling, Dr J. Rzoska and Dr R. H. McConnell considered productivity in aquatic ecosystems of primary, secondary and terminal levels respectively followed by five speakers who dealt with terrestrial productivity: Professor C. D. Pigott on the measurement of productivity of African savanna; Professor G. E. Blackman, F.R.S., on the</page><page sequence="20">64P British Ecological Society limits of crop production; Dr B. Hopkins on a comparison between productivity in forest and savanna in Africa; Professor D. Muller (Copenhagen) on dry matter production in tropical rain forest and Dr H. C. Dawkins on wood production in tropical rain forest. The November meeting was a symposium held jointly with the Society for the Study of Human Biology on 'Human Ecology in the Tropics'. About sixty people attended with Professor J. Weiner, Professor N. Barnicot and Dr K. Mellanby taking the Chair. The Proceedings will be published as a book by the Society for the Study of Human Biology, and summaries will appear in the Journals. The papers read were: Dr R. P. Moss on the tropical forest and savanna ecosystems as environments for man; Dr A. J. Butt on land use and social organization of tropical forest peoples of the Guianas; Dr W. L. Barton on tropical health; Mr G. B. Masefield on food resources and pro- ductivity; Dr C. A. Wright on the ecology of African schistosomiasis; Dr J. Ford on some interactions between human societies and various trypanosome-tsetse-wild fauna complexes; and Dr A. M. Thomson on the development of young children in a West African village. Membership At the end of December 1966, the membership of the Society was 1709 (an increase of 157 compared with 111 in the previous year). This total is made up of 1640 Ordinary Members, twelve Honorary Members, sixteen Honorary Associate Members and forty-one Associate Members. The Society notes with regret the death of six members during the year; fourteen resigned and three were removed by Council under Rule 24 for non-payment of subscriptions. The Annual General Meeting on 4 January agreed to a change in the Rules in order to abolish the Honorary Associateship and to give Associate Members the same privileges as full members. Of those members receiving the Society's Journals, 1017 subscribe to the Journal of Ecology, 833 to the Journal of Animal Ecology, and 597 to the Journal of Applied Ecology (increases on the previous year of 116, 104 and 116 respectively). Council and Committees Three meetings were held during the year, in January, April and October. The Programme Planning Committee made arrangements for the 1967 Symposium to be held at the University of Reading on 'The Measurement of Environmental Factors in Terrestrial Ecology' with Dr R. Wadsworth as local organizer. Plans were also made for a summer meeting in Czechoslo- vakia in 1967, Dr F. Whitehead acting as United Kingdom organizer. The three Journals published by the Society are appearing on schedule or with only slight delays. Dr J. B. Cragg resigned as joint Hon. Editor of the Journal of Animal Ecology and Dr K. H. Mann was appointed to succeed him. Dr R. W. J. Keay resigned as Secretary of the Tropical Group and was succeeded by Dr Rosemary McConnell. The sixth Symposium volume on 'Light as an Ecological Factor' was published in November. The Society also published as a supplement to the Journal of Applied Ecology the Proceedings of the N.A.T.O. Advanced Study Institute meeting entitled 'Pesticides in the Environment and their Effects on Wildlife', edited by Dr N. W. Moore. An index to the Journal of Ecology, Vols. 21-50 (1933-62), compiled by Mrs J. E. Moullin and edited by K. Marshall, was published in September. The support was sought by the Teesdale Defence Committee of the Society in opposing the proposal to construct a reservoir in Upper Teesdale on one of the most famous botanical sites. Council agreed to join the opposition to the Tees Valley and Cleveland Water Bill both in the petition to the House of Commons and House of Lords Select Committees. During the year, a sub-committee on finance was formed by Council to discuss ways and means of improving the organization of the Society and promoting activities to foster interest in ecology. As a result of the recommendations made, the Secretaries and Treasurers had talks with the Institute of Biology to find out whether the Institute would take some of the load of administrative work, which is becoming increasingly heavy for the Society's honorary officers as membership grows. The Institute had agreed to deal with all the items of routine work put to them for a fee of ?200 per annum beginning on 1 January 1967. The Council also agreed to make available, on permanent loan, copies of the Society's Journals to all the centres of the Field Studies Council and that all full members of the Society should be entitled to 25 % discount on Symposium volumes. The Landscape Ecology Working Party continued their work during the year. In order to</page><page sequence="21">British Ecological Society 65P assess the type and extent of land dereliction problems, sixty-two county planning authorities, industrial concerns, landscape consultants and other organizations and individuals were circulated. A report based on their comments was presented to the October meeting of Council and will be published in future numbers of the Journals. It is concluded that a case has been made for a research and advice centre to be set up to co-ordinate work on land dereliction. The Officers of the Society would like to record their thanks and appreciation to the many people, institutions and universities who have provided help and facilities during the year. E. A. G. DUFFEY G. T. GOODMAN Honorary Secretaries The report was adopted. (3) Presenting the report of the Honorary Treasurers, Dr F. H. Whitehead said that since he was retiring from the Treasurership, he would like to draw attention to the results of the financial policy over his tenure of office during the last 10 years, as outlined on the paper he had circulated. During this time, the Society had moved from a position where investments were having to be sold to offset the considerable losses made by the Journals (as in 1957 and 1958) to the present favourable situation of surplus where the Council were able to re-invest ?5000 last year and up to a further ?6000 this year. Although reserves were at present running at approximately ?18 000, this apparently large sum was not very big in relation to the Society's running costs and could be wiped out by a failure of one of the Society's publications. In this connection, Dr Whitehead went on to pay tribute to the editors of the Society's publications and also to Mr P. Saugman of Blackwell Scientific Publications for his invaluable financial advice and business co-operation. Finally Dr Whitehead thanked his co-treasurer and the Officers and Council for their support during his tenure of office. Professor Harper from the Chair thanked the Treasurers for their most favourable report and stressed the Society's indebtedness to Dr Whitehead for his excellent financial guidance during his tenure of office. Dr T. Huxley and Dr J. Satchell respectively proposed and seconded the adoption of the report; this was carried. (4) The Honorary Editor of the Journal of Ecology, Mr P. Greig-Smith, was unavoidably absent through illness and his report was read by Dr Duffey. There had been a satisfactory flow of suitable material during the year. Thanks to the co-operation of the members of the Editorial Board and the publisher, the three parts of the Journal had appeared with only very slight delay. Volume 54 included forty-nine original papers, four Biological Flora accounts and twenty- two pages of reviews, together with the Society's proceedings and a list of members. Volume 55 (1) was now in proof and sufficient material in hand for the second part. A new form of 'Instruc- tions to Contributors' to be used by all three Journals had been drafted. This had needed con- siderable discussion among the Editors; they were indebted to Professor 0. W. Richards, who organized the necessary consultations. (5) Professor 0. W. Richard's report on behalf of the Honorary Editors of the Journal of Animal Ecology indicated that the three parts of Volume 35 had appeared on time and contained thirty-five original papers in the following approximate categories: mammals three, birds five, insects ten, freshwater four, marine nine, soil organisims three, and general one. Volume 36 (1) was expected to appear on time. Dr J. B. Cragg had resigned his Honorary editorship on leaving for Canada in April and Council had appointed Dr K. H. Mann as second editor from October. The proposed increase in size of the editorial board would probably make the work of producing the Journal less onerous. (6) Dr Duffey apologized on behalf of the Honorary Editors of the Journal of Applied Ecology for their absence and read their report. The Journal was slightly behind schedule, Volume 3 (2) being delayed by about a month. There was now a good flow of suitable material for publication and a better balance between zoological and botanical papers. The number of papers still outstanding meant that some delay in publication was likely and some consideration would be given to increasing the parts per volume from two to three. Dr J. Warren Wilson had been invited to join the Editorial Board. (7) In the unavoidable absence of Professor C. D. Pigott owing to illness his report on behalf</page><page sequence="22">66P British Ecological Society of the Editors of the Biological Flora was read for him. Accounts of four species had been pub- lished in Volume 54 of the Journal of Ecology and a further three accounts were in press with another three in the hands of the Editor. The total number of accounts now published was 130. During 1966, a thorough revision had been made by Professor Pigott of accounts in active preparation and copies of the new list were available. Any member considering the preparation of an account should write at once to Professor Pigott at the University of Lancaster. (8) The following, having been nominated by the Council, were proposed from the Chair and unanimously elected as Officers and Members of Council. Vice-President: M. E. SOLOMON Hon. Secretaries: E. A. G. DUFFEY, G. T. GOODMAN Hon. Treasurer: T. R. E. SOUTHWOOD Hon. Editors (Journal of Ecology): P. GREIG-SMITH (Journal of Animnal Ecology): 0. W. RICHARDS, K. H. MANN (Journal of Applied Ecology): A.

BREMNER The President thanked retiring officers and Council members for their valuable service to the Society, in particular Dr J. Cragg, Dr R. W. J. Keay (for his work with the Tropical Ecology Group) and Dr F. H. Whitehead. (9) The following alterations to the Rules, having been recommended by Council, were introduced to the meeting from the Chair. After discussion, a resolution that the changes be approved, proposed by Dr T. Huxley and seconded by Mr M. E. Solomon, was adopted by the meeting. The following changes were proposed: RULE 3.
