SPECK INTRODUCTION The Penobscot tribe inhabits the Penobscot river valley of north central Maine. This is the southern frontier of the northern forest zone, or taiga, where the "snowshoe-hunting" type of culture as defined by Steensby, or the "ice-hunting" area of Birket-Smith meets the maize area. This paper is a supplement to a manuscript on Penobscot ethnology. The investigation was officially begun in the summer of 19o09, in the interests of the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania, through the support of Dr. George G. Heye. It was continued steadily from this time for seven years, most of my time when freed from duties at the University being given over to the project; the language was devotedly studied, and residence with the tribe enjoyed through different seasons of the year during periods of from several weeks duration to several months at a time, permitting me to participate in practically all of the activities then carried on. The occasion was opportune, because there were then a score or more of aged Indians whose life span reached back to the days when European influence had not deeply affected their economic life. The railroads had not spread their network of highways across the old hunting grounds of the tribe. The northern forests had not been wasted and burned in the frenzied process of exploitation for lumber and pulp. Beaver, moose, deer, and even the now almost exter- minated caribou were abundant and nearly everywhere to be had by the hunters. Many of them had been born in birch-bark wigwams in the interior forests lying between the old settled counties along the coast and the Canadian frontier. The cry of the wolf was a not unfamiliar sound to some of them in their childhood. It should be borne in mind, however, that for more than a century the Roman Church had held them in its control, and had influenced their religious culture. I</page><page sequence="2">2 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. I owe my sincere expressions of obligation to this older and estimable generation of Penobscot men and women for their cooperation in dictat- ing and explaining the beliefs recorded--especially to Newell Lion, Gabe Paul, Hemlock Joe, Peter Nicolar, Joe Solomon, Newell Francis, John Attean, Joe Paul Susup, Frank Denis, Katie Paul, Clara Neptune, Cecile Barker, Sarah Paul, and Alice Swassion. I have drawn considerably, also, from the information given by old Joseph Nicolar in his little book "The Red Man."' All but three of them have died since I first began the study of this interesting group in 1907, and with them has gone the possibility of the study of aboriginal Penobscot culture. Among the Penobscot of a younger generation should be mentioned the names of some in particular who have been consulted in the course of my study: Molliedellis Nelson; John F. Susep; and especially that of Roland Nelson who through his influence in his tribe and lectures in the country at large has done much to dignify Penobscot history and culture. My old friend and companion Gabe Paul, who, though a Malecite by birth, has lived with the Penobscot for over forty years, has also helped in the collection of Penobscot ethnological material. The Penobscot and other Wabanaki units have these characteristic traits of Northeastern America: limited nomadism centering around the reindeer or caribou and the moose, absence of agriculture, similarities in hunting and fishing devices, skin and birch-bark canoes, skin and bark covered conical wigwams, skin leggings, tailored coats with hoods for protection in winter, skin moccasins of a fairly uniform type, birch- bark vessels and baskets, cedar or bass-wood fibre bags and thongs, characteristic decorative motives in birch-bark etching and in various later forms of embroidery, the absence of stratification in social or- ganization, the family-unit with exclusive hunting districts, weakness of government, abandonment of the aged and of orphans, occasional economic anthropophagy, certain games and contests, the absence of religious ceremonial gatherings, characteristic conjuring shamanism, and general tendencies toward individualism in society and religion. Much of the original religious philosophy has been lost among the Penobscot through an almost three-century contact with Roman mis- sionaries. Nevertheless their language and their wealth of mythology are helpful in reconstructing the Penobscot essentials. There is every indication that even more could be done with the somewhat less modern- ized Malecite, Passamaquoddy and Micmac, the study of which should permit a final evaluation of the Penobscot religious problem. Among the Algonkian, as among most preliterate peoples, there is within the same tribe a wide range in religious feeling and performance. 1 Joseph Nicolar, The Life and Traditions of the Red Man, Bangor, Me., 1893.</page><page sequence="3">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 3 In these tribes religious attitudes vary from gross indifference, through casual knowledge of religious beliefs and luck-bringing practices, to cases of deep personal interest. The latter include, of course, the thinkers of the tribe. There seems nowhere to be a group without them. Among the Northern forest people there are not the religious societies composed of devotees and initiates such as exist among the Ojibwa and other Central Algonkian tribes. We possess no direct evidence to show that such existed among the Wabanaki peoples any more than among the Labradorean Algonkian or the Eskimo. We might wonder if the deficiency of formal religious ceremonies is as characteristic of the Wabanaki as it apparently is of the whole northeastern area. There seem to have been no important religious rites comparable to the periodically recurring ceremonies of the central Algonkian or Iroquoian people. This of course does not mean that the Penobscot lacked cere- monial occasions such as installation, greeting, wedding, burial rites, and dances. Some of these still exist, but in native concept they are cere- monies of a social rather than a devotional or religious nature. One may conjecture, however, from the fact that the Penobscot were some- what more localized than the tribes north of the St. Lawrence, where communal religious ceremonies are hardly known, that a few may formerly have occurred among them. The professional priesthood, the conjurors and shamans, have disap- peared completely with the death of the last heathen mode'olanuwak, or "jongleurs" as the French missionary explorers styled them, probably a century ago, and the conversion of the last half-pagan practitioners of witchcraft several generations ago.' Whatever cosmological beliefs and psychic practices were known to them have been obliterated. The Jesuit savant Pierre Biart and the ascetic Ennemond Masse began in 1611 their mission among the Souriquois at Port Royal in Acadia, and levelled their most strenuous attacks upon the sorcerers, those stubborn bulwarks of Northern Algonkian paganism, while the common people were left in possession of their religious superstitions. Though their Penobscot mission was sacked by Argall in 1613 at Saint Sauveur and at Port Royal, esoteric shamanism had already been destroyed among the Wabanaki and today Penobscot cosmology is preserved only in mythology. 1 The results of an endeavor to assemble what information could be gathered from aged Penobscot Indians who knew of this bygone period were published in 1920 in a monograph on Penobscot Shamanism to which the reader is referred (Memoirs of the American Anthropological Association, Vol. VI, No. 3, 1920).

PENOBSCOT BELIEFS ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL The Concept of the Supreme Being Other Supernatural Beings Gluskabe the Transformer Supernatural Creatures and Phenomena of the Wilderness Beliefs: Concepts of the Universe Omens and Taboos concerning Animals Personal Animal Taboos The Game Owner Concept Power of Wish Divination Dreams, Amulets, Omens and Some Special Taboos Weather Signs THE CONCEPT OF THE SUPREME BEING The spiritual force dominating the universe is a power, or in the opinions of some a being, called Ketci-Ni'-wskwe, Great Being. In modern Penobscot belief it corresponds to the Holy Spirit, the third of the Catholic Trinity. This concept, as even some of the Indians are inclined to think, is possibly the result of Christian teaching. Only the vaguest ideas are obtainable about the Great Being. Nicolar says: "By his will all things moved; all power comes from him ..... He is in the sun, moon, stars, clouds of heaven, mountains, and even the trees of the earth."' He seems to have been the creator according to recent native concepts which undoubtedly, like those expressed by Nicolar, have been influenced by Catholic teaching. He does not appear in myth nor was supplication addressed to him. Originally the Great Being may have been similar to the usual Algonkian Great Spirit. The term manitu itself is not found in Penobscot, its cognate appearing as wahdn-do, the suffix -han-do denoting beings possessed of supernatural power. The ordinary generic term for an evil spirit is wahdn'do, which is likewise a "bug" or "insect." Evil spirits were thought to take the form of noxious insects and to cause disease and misfortune. The Supreme Being is also called debildak, "owner," a variant of which is deblmalak, "our owner," and gizi-uli-"to'lak, "our maker, creator." These terms have been transferred to contemporary Catholic usage, and their older connotations cannot now be ascertained. Both the words and their present applications must date from early priestly teachings, for I have recorded the same designations in St. Francis Abenaki and Wawenock. The term ktahdn'dowit' may be translated "great spiritual being." It is the term spontaneously used in native mythology, and in a cognate 1 Joseph Nicolar, The Red Man, Bangor, 1893, p. 14.</page><page sequence="5">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 5 form is encountered among the Algonkian tribes of southern New Eng- land and among the Delaware tribes. The antithesis of the Great Being is designated Madji-ahaindo, Evil Spirit. He is the arch-demon of evil corresponding to the European personification of the devil, from which he is undoubtedly derived. OTHER SUPERNATURAL BEINGS The Penobscot personify animals and many other natural manifesta- tions. The term awa' s refers to the individual animal or beast as it is generally translated, to certain human personifications dwelling as demons apart from human society, and to the elemental manifesta- tions. There are three classes of beings: (a) the quasi-human creatures of all kinds frequenting the forest, bodies of water and the air, (b) the races of animals of the same realm, and (c) the phenomena which to our minds form part of the physical geographical universe without vitality, but which, to the Northeastern Algonkian, are personalities of the air, land and water. (a) Individual supernatural human-like creatures dwell in the environment of man. Some of them constitute groups or tribes, play the part of major actors in mythical narratives, are looked upon as coexistent with man and often enter into active association with him. They have certain idiosyncrasies of character, desire, will, habits, and physical characteristics. The origin of some of them is explained in the myths. Others, like Gluskabe, lead an existence whose origin is taken for granted without explanation. To this class there is little that is common property, so I shall treat them individually in the subjoined list. (b) The beings which we generally know simply as animals have "tribal" existence and individual natures as do the tribes of man. Only they are more diverse in form and habit. Not being endowed with technical gifts and powers equal to man, they are weaker than he. Con- sequently they fall victims to his attacks, and become his source of life. As races and as individuals, moreover, man owes them certain obliga- tions by the fulfillment of which he satisfies their demands so far as he comprehends them. (c) The personified natural phenomena known as agencies of power were undoubtedly more numerous in the past than they are at present. Gluskabe the Transformer: The most important personage in Penobscot religious lore and one purely aboriginal in character is named Gluskabe,1 1 gluski is translated as "deceit, lie, nothing." -dbe or -abe is a stem denoting "person" (cf. also Nicolar, p. 12). The name is cognate with Wawenock, Gluskab'; St. Francis Abenaki, GluskQbd; Malecite, Gli'skap; Micmac, Kul6skap. The English spelling of the name, as adopted by several authors, is Gluskabe.</page><page sequence="6">6 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. "deceiver, liar," or "man from nothing," according to different opinions among informants. The translation may be Deceiver or Trickster, but the epithet is not uncomplimentary because it refers to the ability to outwit one's enemies by strategy and cunning, He is the legendary hero and transformer personage of the Wabanaki tribes. Even at the present day his performances and his personality are sources of marvel to the Indians, many of whom though they are observing Catholics, nevertheless cherish a superstitious belief in him. Not only actual transformations but unaccountable peculiarities of the whole country are attributed to his agency. He is largely responsible for the present aspect of the earth and its inhabitants. The major r1le played by him as a culture-hero is quaintly described by Nicolar: "Gluskabe, the man from Nothing was claimed by all... to be the first person who came upon the earth, and he was their (the people's) teacher. He taught them how they must live, and told them about the supernatural power, how it was in every living thing, and... it sent him... to subdue all obstacles which were against mankind; and to reduce the earth to such a state as to become a happy land for the people."' As often in America, the culture-hero is merged with the trickster. Some of his performances are of a trifling nature, and while Gluskabe is the great supernatural wonder, he is not spoken of with reverence nor is he feared. While we gather from the myths that he was often the helper of mankind, he does not seem to have been profoundly concerned with human doings. His own personal interests, his success against rivals were his prime motives. The extolling of ethical principles and provision for his "descendants" do not appear at the beginning of his career; a mission develops only with the course of events. Practically all of the northern Algonkian tribes, as far north as the Montagnais, and as far west as the Ojibwa, to my knowledge, lay the scenes of their transformers' adventures within the bounds of their own habitat, deriving its natural peculiarities from the Trickster's deeds. The Malecite, having fundamentally the same transformer as the Penobscot, believe that their hero went up St. John's river; the St. Francis Abenaki tell of his ascent up the St. Lawrence,2 while the 1 Nicolar in his mythical accounts has evidently exaggerated the dignity of the transformer (op. cit. p. v). He has neglected all the more profane popular stories concerning him and, in particular, the plausible humble origin of the hero. Informants living in the tribe (I918), particularly Newell Lion, from whom Nicolar received considerable help, claim that Nicolar gilded his material with Catholicism in accordance with his own fancies. 2 Only one Abenaki informant has been found who knew any portion of the Gluskabe cycle or even the name: Frangois de la Gonzague, who was encountered in 1912 living among the Huron of Lorette, P. Q. Dr. Hallo- well's intensive study of the tribe has not yielded other sources for the series.</page><page sequence="7">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 7 Penobscot say that he came to the mouth of the Penobscot river, ascended it and then went down again, and departed toward the sea, going south- ward when last seen. Some of the incidents of Gluskabe's journey explain the physical characteristics of the Penobscot valley. The Penobscot river itself is his own creation after killing a monster frog that caused a world drought, the released waters finally flowing away to form the river. Again, the twenty-two families constituting the nucleus of the Penobscot tribe sprang from this period, taking their animal names from their relatives who in their eagerness plunged into the water to slake their thirst and were transformed into fish of different kinds. Thus originated the marine animals. Subsequently Gluskabe in his travels passed near Milo, Maine, where the prints of his snowshoes may still be seen on the rocks. Near Castine, down on the eastern shore of Penobscot Bay he landed his canoe, left his paddle near it, and chased a moose up into the woods for a great distance. On the beach at the point mentioned is a rock about twenty-five feet long, shaped like an overturned canoe. The rocks leading from it bear footprints of Gluskabe, which reappear frequently in the interior of the country according to some of the Indians who claim to have seen them. At another place farther down he killed the moose and cast its entrails across the water. There they still appear as a streak of white rock on the bottom of the bay at Cape Rosier. After cooking the moose he left his cooking pot overturned on the shore of Moosehead Lake and it is now to be seen as Kineo mountain on the eastern margin. Gluskabe subsequently disappeared from the Penobscot country, after effecting a number of transformations in ani- mals and monsters and moderating the seasons. Now he resides at the "end of the world," some say to the east, some to the south. Before leaving, however, he promised the people that he would return some day and drive the enemies of the Indians back into the sea. Until such time Gluskabe and his grandmother, Woodchuck, live together in a wigwam where he makes flint arrowheads and she prepares pounded corn for the great event which will take place when Gluskabe has his wigwam full to the top with arrowheads. Finally there are myths telling how fortunate people have occasionally reached his dwelling place and secured the fulfillment of their wishes from him. Gluskabe is responsible for a number of important innovations in the lives of men and animals. Among these are the distribution of tobacco, the capture and subsequent distribution of game over the world, the tempering of the wind, the removal of dangerous falls and rapids in the rivers, the reduction of the giant beasts, the tempering of the winter, the theft and distribution of summer, besides the bestowal of charac- teristics on some animals: the sparse growth of hair on the woodchuck's belly, the split wings and dark juice in the mouth of the grasshopper, the crook in the frog's backbone, the shyness of the fox when near man, the dog's friendship for man, the ugliness of toads, the position of the</page><page sequence="8">8 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. turtle's penis and the characteristics of his upper shell, the black color of the skunk and his bad odor. Among other beneficent acts attributed to Gluskabe, one not included in the cycle of the hero is the destruction of the Great White Hare, the giant of the north, who was gaining control of all the hares of the world. Hare lived, the tale narrates, on the peak of a great mountain in the far north where he ruled over a realm of hares. These hares were people who had fallen victim to a fierce witch and her daughters who had combed out their brains and sent them to the Great White Hare to dwell with him forever. Gluskabe invaded the domain of the Great White Hare, passing through the awful blizzard of snow with which the Hare surrounded himself, killed him and freed his victims, thus liberating hares to scatter throughout the world to furnish food for the people. In all the above achievements Gluskabe benefits mankind. More than this, the various implements and appurtenances of travel which were made for Gluskabe's journey by his grandmother, the Woodchuck, such as canoe, snowshoes, game bag, moose-call, and the like, seem to be understood as the first of their kind invented, the manufacture after- ward becoming known to the Indians. There are several indications that the Penobscot concept of Gluskabe has been influenced by the traditions of the Micmac or Malecite of St. John's river, where most of the Gluskabe feats are located. Nicolar says, "None of the traditions (Penobscot) located the country wherein all these things took place, but it was agreed by all interested in later years that it was on the eastern part of the..,. world. So much of this belief remained... that the people began to look for the appearance of other people (the Europeans) in that direction, which proved to them after- wards that their belief was a true one." Among the Passamaquoddy and the Malecite I have heard it said that the Micmac know more than they about Gluskap. The Penobscot think that after leaving the main seats of his labors in New Brunswick he came down the coast to their river in the last stages of his earthly sojourn. A short account of Gluskabe was given by a Penobscot woman to Leland' a number of years ago: "Gluskabe gave names to everything. He made men and gave them life and made the wind to make the waters move. The Turtle was his uncle, the Mink his adopted son, and the Woodchuck his grandmother. The beaver built a great dam, and Glus- kabe turned it away and killed the beaver.2 1 C. G. Leland, Algonquin Legends of New England, Boston, 1884, p. 65. The author also mentions other landmarks, one, quoting Thoreau, being Mt. Kineo which is said to be a cow moose killed by Gluskabe, this being a garbled reference to the usual version. 2 Evidently refers to the Malecite version. This episode is lacking among the Penobscot.</page><page sequence="9">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 9 "At Moosechick1 he killed a moose, and the bones may be seen at Bar Harbor turned to stone. He threw the entrails of the moose across the bay to his dogs and they, too, may be seen there to this day as I myself have seen them, and there, too, in the rocks are the prints of his bow and arrow." When the Indians find stones possessing natural shapes, resembling a face or a person, they sometimes keep them as curiosities if not for more superstitious reasons. I have heard them say, "It looks like Glus- kabe, I guess he left his picture on it," and the like. Naturally all such places on the river or bay shore or on the mountain sides suggesting the human profile, and they are by no means uncommon in the rocky country, have the same said about them. Or they say it is the likeness of some local shaman. Despite some of the local variations in the minor performances of Gluskabe, the general tone is quite uniform. Thus far no hint of a malicious twin brother to Gluskabe has come to light in Penobscot mythology, such as is reported by Leland and Prince for the Micmac or Malecite.2 This is apparently a genuine negative characteristic, lending a rather distinctive color to eastern Algonkian when contrasted with Iroquois transformer tales. Another author who had considerable contact with the Indians of Maine some years ago3 recorded from the lips of an aged informant information on the derivation of Gluskabe. I quote from her article but have harmonized the spellings of proper names to correspond with those adopted in this paper. In the beginning Ketci Niweskwe made Adam out of earth but he did not make Gluskabe. Gluskabe made himself out of dust that was kicked up in the creation of Adam. He rose and walked about; but he could not speak until Ketci Niweskwe opened his lips. Ketci Niweskwe made the earth and the sea, and then he took council with Gluskabe concerning them. He asked him if it would be better to have the rivers run up on one side of the earth and down the other, but Gluskabe said, "No, they must all run down one side." Then Ketci Niweskwe asked him about the ocean, whether it would do to have it lie still. Gluskabe told him, "No, it must rise and fall; or else it would grow thick and stagnant." "How about fire?" asked Ketci Niweskwe. "Can it burn all the time and nobody put it out ?" Gluskabe said, "That would not do; for if anybody got burned and the fire could not be put out, they would die; but if it could be put out, the burn would get well." So he answered Ketci Niweskwe's questions. 1 musi-'ketci, "moose rump," now Cape Rosier. 2 Cf. Leland and Prince, Kuloskap the Master, N. Y., 1902, pp. 43-44. Gluskabe has a twin brother, Malsum, "wolf," who at birth emerged through his mother's arm-pit. The twin is opposed to Gluskabe's good deeds and subsequently vanquished. The story suggests Iroquois influence. 3 A. Alger, Popular Science Monthly, vol. 44, pp. 195-6.</page><page sequence="10">Io 07ournal of American Folk-Lore. Penobscot mythology credits Gluskabe with some twenty major achievements for the benefit of man, to wit: distributing over the world the game animals, food, fish, hares and tobacco; renewing the warmth of summer; protecting the eagle above who regulates daylight and darkness; moderating the destructive force of the wind; tempering the winter; bringing the summer north; reducing giant animals to a harmless size; domesticating the dog; clearing obstructions from the portages along the routes of hunting and travel; smoothing out the most dangerous waterfalls; creating the whole Penobscot river system; moderating the power of fire; making burns curable; creating sweetgrass; and serving as a source of power for those who come to his distant dwelling with their troubles. His benefits to mankind reach a climax in the mission he allots to himself to watch over his people and to return to the land at some unknown date, against which time he is preparing food and armament to save them in a crisis. By inference the Penobscot are also inclined to attribute to him the origin of their arts and inventions. In some twelve episodes, moreover, he puts into practice the ethical code of the northeastern Indians, by punishing early mankind as well as fabulous beasts. For sins of overgreed in satisfying thirst he trans- forms the people into races of aquatic creatures. He punishes selfishness and avarice by inflicting death and disfigurement upon the giant frog for monopolizing the world's water supply, upon the grasshopper for hoarding the world's tobacco. He transforms and punishes the men who secure from him the gratification of their vanity and then disobey his rules. He twice disfigures his uncle, Turtle, for overstepping his allotted power. He switches and condemns the fox for deceiving, mocking and urinating over his poor grandmother, Woodchuck. Handsome women who mock are transformed into toads. He destroys the winter-god, Snow Man, and the Great White Hare for cruelty to mankind here below. He thwarts the withholders of summer, and robs them of their treasure. Skunk is punished and marked for knavery and for deceiving the bird above that causes day and night, and for interfering with the natural order of things. And, of much importance in native ethics, he opposes witchcraft and destroys witches. Gluskabe's ethical code, like that of the natives, does not stigmatize the "white lie" which he uses for beneficial ends, employing it on the primeval game animals, the fish, the Wind Bird, Grasshopper, the winter- god, his malevolent brothers, the retainers of the "summer fluid," and his uncle Turtle. When he is found in unintentional error by his grand- mother, however, he does not hesitate to confess to her and to obey. Nicolar appears interested in identifying Gluskabe with the Catholic Holy Ghost. Hence Nicolar's story attributing Gluskabe's origin to the will of the Great Being can be best understood as deriving from Catholic teachings: "Said the Great Spirit, 'I have given the earth four seeds, and from them have sprung man, beast, fish, and fowl. I have given</page><page sequence="11">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. I I power and strength to them all except man; but this I shall change. Behold Klose-kom-beh, my spirit, has gone forth to warn those in power that at the bidding of man he shall acknowledge him as chief.' "1 The origin of the hero as an orphan boy, as the weakest of a family of brothers or in other humble guises (which are the origins also of the other mytho- logical heroes, Froth, Fast Runner, Snowy Owl, Long Hair, and Seventh Son), evidently shows the aboriginal point of view-one much more in harmony with the myth concepts general among the Algonkian peoples. As the creator of the first pair of human beings, Gluskabe is again depicted in a form to suggest later Christian influence. After preparing the earth for the red race, he met an old woman who called him grandson. She had sprung from "the heat of the sun warming the dew on the rock." Then she consecrated herself to his protection, but in this version she is not called Woodchuck as in the native texts. Another being, a male, then appeared to Gluskabe and posed as his maternal uncle. He sprang from "the heat of the sun on the foam of the waters." He was instructed to search for his mate who should be "born from the bloom of plants." This pair then became the progenitors of the people. The tale appears to have been extensively retouched by the pens of amateurs. The heroes of Penobscot mythology, Long Hair, Froth, Snowy Owl, Fond-of-Traveling, Fast Runner, Abandoned Boy, White Weasel, and even Skunk, resemble Gluskabe in character and are very similar to one another. All of them begin life as poor orphans or waifs, and three of them, Long Hair, Snowy Owl, and Froth, are cared for and raised by their grandmothers, two of them, Long Hair and Froth, having Wood- chuck as grandmother. Five of them, Long Hair, Froth, Snowy Owl, Abandoned Boy and White Weasel, develop into infant prodigies, all having magic bows and arrows, sometimes of ivory, with which they progress rapidly from hare hunters to big game hunters. Both Long Hair and White Weasel are like Gluskabe in wishing, early in life, to search for relatives who have abandoned them. Next come the miraculous deeds. They have moccasins made for them as Gluskabe had snowshoes, and all of them meet and slay beast-ogres who are menacing the lives of the people. They undergo tests at the hands of cruel masters and van- quish them with apparent ease. Snowy Owl, like Gluskabe, meets and destroys creatures who are responsible for a water famine. Fast Runner, Long Hair and White Weasel all succeed in tests of beaver hunts and ball games, as Gluskabe did. These minor personages, however, are not by any means as great transformers as Gluskabe. Long Hair transforms his enemies into sharks; Fond-of-Traveling punishes his opposers by 1 This paragraph occurs also in Historic Maine and Indian Mythology, anonymous author, but possibly by Francis West, who is given as the illus- trator.

Long Hair even duplicates the achievement of Gluskabe in taming the dog, and reducing the size of dangerous animals, in this case the squirrel. White Weasel duplicates Gluskabe's act in making a stone canoe, Katadan, Great Mountain, the personification of Mt. Katahdin, and his son Katadan6'si's, Young Katahdin, have also encroached in some versions upon the r1le of Gluskabe, for they appear as handsome youths identified by flint stones in their cheeks. The same event is attributed sometimes to one of the miscellaneous heroes and sometimes to Gluskabe and the principal narrator of myths and a leading conservative, Newell Lion, related the tale of the domes- tication of the dog at intervals of several years, first as the deed of Glus- kabe, then as one of Long Hair. The various heroes also have adventures which are not recorded of Gluskabe. Long Hair has a romantic adven- ture, so does Fast Runner. Long Hair escapes abandonment by sailing off on the back of a great fish, as Gluskabe does in the corresponding cycles of the neighboring Wabanaki tribes. Froth is born of a virgin who is made pregnant while swimming through contact with a mass of foam, and encounters and kills a giant White Bear invulnerable except in the heel, a fact which chickadee whispers into his ear at the last moment. Fond-of-Traveling rides the wind to a realm of ghost people clad in white hare skins and resembling Europeans. Fast Runner is born from the entrails of the victim of a great bear, is the hero of the "swing" episode, and escapes. He also wrestles with and subdues a wampum-clad giant from whom he takes the wampum. Abandoned Boy escapes in the "magic flight" and secures a source of wampum in the shape of a bird that sheds the beads from its feathers. Skunk achieves notoriety chiefly in losing his beautiful white coat and gaining undesirable qualities. In the mythology of other American tribes a single animal often plays trickster parts but here trickster exploits are divided among a number of animals. The raccoon, hare, wolverine, porcupine, partridge, sable and fisher all share the marplot motive. They are regarded as having been shamans, of the period before man and the animals had become differentiated. Like most American tricksters they are neither wor- shipped nor feared, being regarded merely as actors who outwit their associates or are outwitted by them. Certain of their deeds transformed the world into its present appearance. Supernatural Creatures and Phenomena of the Wilderness: Penobscot belief attributes existence to a host of beings, neither human nor animal in nature, whose abodes are forest depths, rocky crags and ledges, mountain tarns, outlets of lakes or deep river pools, knolls of earth, and all spots unfrequented by man and unmolested by animals. For all we are told, the fairies live on forever, unless life is interrupted by man. It is by hearsay of the wise, or by chance meeting on lonely excursions</page><page sequence="13">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 3 that people get knowledge of them. Several genera of fairies bring death to human lovers who succumb to their enticements. There are fairy seducers who appeal respectively to both sexes and fairy omens of both good and evil fate in the life of men; most fairies play parts in myths. Gluskabe had encounters with some of the uncanny herd. Alombegwi'no'si's, under-water man-dwarf, is a shy man-like dwarfish being who lives in deep pools along the rivers or in lakes. Sometimes these dwarfs dwell singly, sometimes in bands carrying on the ordinary mode of life under water. They possess considerable power. They can increase their size at will or decrease it so as to secrete themselves even in a curled leaf. An account states that they have a small cooking vessel into which they put two or three kernels of corn which then swell up to such quantity that it cannot be eaten at one meal. They are estimated to be about three feet in stature, having uncombed straight black hair reaching below the waist, and going entirely naked. Usually they keep themselves out of sight of man. Whenever any of these spirits appear it is an omen that someone will be drowned. Some think that the person who sees one will be drowned within a year. A story is told of a water dwarf who lived in a deep pool of the Penobscot river at Milford opposite the village at Indian Island. An Indian who camped there was awakened one winter night by the dwarf who then disappeared through the ice. Within a year the man himself was drowned by falling through a hole in the ice. Another spot in the Penobscot river, about forty miles above Oldtown back of Lincoln Island in a dense growth of pines and hemlocks, is pointed out as the abode of one of these beings. The place is isolated. A deep pool lies at the foot of the ledge. Once a man in a desire to take one of them buried himself in the sand near where these creatures had been seen. After several attempts he captured one. The little merman begged to be freed, even offering his captor his sister. In token of his sincerity he left his bow and arrows with his captor. Soon after he brought his sister to the place where the Indian lived with his grand- mother. The little woman had with her her cooking and work utensils. The Indian laughed at the size of the things. But she put three kernels of corn in the kettle and boiled them and the little kettle became so full of corn that they could not eat it up. Noda'm'kenowet', grabbing-from-beneath-the-water, is a creature of the pools, half fish and half human. It has a broad, short face and long streaming hair. The upper part of its face shows above the surface of the water at times. It annoys women who are bathing by touching their genitals, and serves as a warning to venturesome females. The habit of peering, with only the upper part of the face showing, is thought by some to account for its extraordinary breadth. Ki'w6'kwe, going-about-in-the-woods, is one of a race of horrid cannibal giants who wander through the forest solitudes. We learn from</page><page sequence="14">14 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. the tales they are male and female. One tale relates how two of them were observed in mortal combat: "A man, his wife and little girl were living far from other people in the woods. They heard someone coming. Suddenly a noise was heard in the smoke hole of the wigwam and looking up they saw a Ki-wa'kwe peering down. The old woman of the wigwam said aloud, 'Oh! Your grandfather has come,' speaking to her husband. The monster was pleased at this and grew small. He came around and entered the camp. The woman tried to feed him but he would not eat in spite of her coaxing. He said, 'I shall meet somebody here and we will fight.' Then he sent them away across a lake and he fought with the other Ki-wa'kwe. He had told them to leave the place if he got killed by the other. But he won the fight and when it was over he ate with them, becoming again an ordinary man." The concept corresponds with that of the windigo of the far northern Algonkian, for a Ki-wa'kwe is simply an ordinary man who only assumes the hideous role of man-eater when angry. He has a piece of ice in his stomach in the shape of a person, and this is regarded as the source of his evil inclination. Should one of them get rid of this piece of ice he would revert to normal existence. Others mention taking salt to produce vomiting as a means of ridding the cannibal of ice and his maniac control. The more he vomits the smaller he becomes, and is finally "ruined so far as his spiritual power is concerned." He is of great size, and increases prodigiously the angrier he grows. He possesses such power of voice that his yells kill the human hearer. Ki'wa'kwe is indeed an ogre held in much dread. The mere sight of his enormous imprints in the rocks or earth was formerly enough to cause the evacuation of the neighborhood. A powerful shaman, med0olinu, often became a Ki'wa'kwe at his death, and after he had devoured seven people he returned to life again. Ki'wa'kwe has to be cut up into small pieces before he can be permanently killed. In some accounts the monster is covered with skin of stone, in others he is said to coat himself with balsam pitch three inches thick by rolling in a bed of pitch while it is soft. Wanagameswak, reckless creatures, are little people of another genus, who inhabit rivers. They have narrow faces "like the blade of a hatchet," so only the profile has an outline. Their noses are high and aquiline, "so large as to be all over the face," says one mention. They are very friendly to the Indians and in the past warned them of approaching danger such as the coming of hostile Mohawk. Ordinarily, however, they keep aloof from human contact. They are noted for their habit of shaping varied figures out of clay overnight and leaving them on the river shores. These clay concretions are thought by the Indians to be representations of men, women, birds, animals, turtles, and what not, moulded simply in play. Some consider it lucky to find a few of these objects. The little people are fond of inhabiting deep pools in the smaller streams, and like jolly elves are continually dancing and singing in the old Indian fashion. It is common belief that a hunter will hear them if he</page><page sequence="15">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 1 5 will remain quiet for a couple of hours in some lonely spot near a stream. The sound they make is like "hol hol!" Eskuddit', fire creature, is evidently to be identified with the will o' the wisp. From some accounts it seems to be the fire hallucination. Wherever it is seen, calamity is imminent: if over a house, a death will occur there; if it travels in a certain direction, trouble will follow. Some Indians think they see it burst. Some confusion exists in the identifi- cation of comets, falling stars, and meteors with fiery manifestations like the above. Pemile is the spirit who inhabits the neighborhood of Mt. Katahdin. He is homeless and roams abroad with a pack on his back. He has a head, legs, and arms or wings but no body, and can alter his size at will. Within quite recent times Indians claim to have seen Pemble in the vicinity of Mt. Katahdin flying through the air, merely a head and wings. He is friendly to the people. A legend teaches that once a year he starts from the eastern horizon and flies across the world to the opposite horizon. He propels himself with a bull-roarer in each hand twirling them like wings. (The bull-roarer is called Pem6le ut6hagan, "Pemuile's paddle.") When he starts from the horizon he gives one cry, when he reaches the zenith he gives another, when he reaches the opposite horizon he gives the last cry, thus crossing the world in three crys. Should the people desire his aid they build a fire upon hearing his first cry and burn grease so that the smoke arises and signals him before he reaches the zenith. This induces him to descend and answer their appeal. Tci-bel6kwa, suspended, is the name of a being of the air claimed to be the same as Pemuile. Tcikweligwe is a bird spirit that flies overhead toward night crying "xu xu! " Agalibemu is the monster frog that dwelt, in the pretransformation period, near Chesuncook Lake. He swallowed all the waters of the world causing a drought which was broken when Gluskabe slew him. The released waters formed the Penobscot river, and many of the thirsty people in their haste to get water were turned into fish. This is one of the important episodes in the culture-hero myth. Agalibemu, according to other testimony, is a giant lizard-like monster whose kind inhabited Mt. Katahdin, having horse-like heads, large bodies almost like whales, and tails like snakes. In their sports on the mountainside legend claims they ploughed deep gorges which can still be plainly seen there. Many generations ago, the story runs, the last of these monsters were seen to leave the mountain and come tearing down Penobscot river and bay. The last seen of them was out at sea where, after lashing up the water in their sport, they disappeared toward the south. A likeness of the head of one of these creatures occurs carved on the handle of a basket splint cutter.</page><page sequence="16">I 6 _ournal of American Folk-Lore. Wudjaiis-en is a bird-like creature who causes the winds by blowing his breath, and also, according to Prince,' by flapping his wings. Skwakcwtemus, swamp woman, is a female being clad only in moss, with long flowing moss-hair covering her form. Evidently this is the same creature as Pskeigdemus, below. She is occasionally heard moaning and crying in the depths of some lonely tract of forest. It is thought well to avoid her. A female creature, Pskegdemus, is, according to some, the same as Skwakewtemus. She constantly longs for men and children. She is often heard crying or wailing near the camps trying to lure a hunter. Whoever pities her and goes to her is likely never to return. Men who commiserate her even in thought are apt to suffer the penalty of never wanting to marry. If one even wishes ardently for her it is said she will come to him. She is also mentioned to children as one who will carry them off if they wander alone from the camps and houses. Maski' kcwsu, toad creature, smelly, also translated as "tempting eyes toward women," a female woods spirit, is a seducer of men and children. Her clothing consists of sheets of green moss and a strip of cedar bark serves as a belt. She lingers near camps where children are, and cries for child companionship. Should a child go to her she nurses and fondles it, but, though her intentions are good, an involuntary baleful influence soothes it into a sleep from which there is no awakening. She is said also to appear in the form of a partridge. One spring after the ice had run out of the brooks, John Mitchell and his father, while trapping, met two other hunters and traveled downstream in two canoes. They noticed one of these little women as they passed a grassy place along the shore where she sat humming to herself. They observed that she was about two and a half feet tall and very dark skinned. Another time John Bear (Susep) was passing through his hunting territory near Chesuncook. He perceived a dwarf dodging behind a tree near him. The men of the party succeeded in capturing it and it turned out to be a man with a bone bow and arrow. He offered it to John Susep's grandfather, but he was afraid to accept it. The corresponding conception for women consists of twin beings known as Mikumwe'swak, Micmac (?) creatures, or little powerful creatures. These two little fellows are waist high, and entice young women into the depths of the woods. Women who consort with them never want to marry. Like the seducer of the opposite sex they come when wished for. If sought for and found by the individual they may become spiritual helpers. When hunters slept without shelter in the woods in winter, they placed their snowshoes over their heads, the ends thrust into the snow, to avoid the maliciousness of a mikamwes'u who might pass by and push their brains out. Such a fate was said to have over- 1 Leland and Prince, p. 70, Passamaquoddy, wuchosen.</page><page sequence="17">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 1 7 taken any hunters found dead in the bush. It is possible that these conceptions refer to personifications of Micmac spirits. The Penobscot call a Micmac, mik'ma, youngster; the Malecite call him mikam. It might appear from this that the idea originated perhaps with the Malecite who are nearer the Micmac, and was passed on to the Penobscot. It is interesting to note in addition that a magical visitor is also attributed to the Mohawk, namely, awuskhdwa, spy. Awuskh6wa, spy, is an imaginary spirit born of the dread entertained for the Mohawk. He is a Mohawk wraith who comes through the village in the night spying out how many men are prepared for war, whether the tribe is increasing, and other matters of a military nature. He goes from tribe to tribe gathering information which he carries back to Caughna- waga, the Mohawk center. He comes down the Penobscot river and returns over it. An Awuskh6wa years ago was discovered leaving Indian Island ensconced in a roll of birch-bark which was moving rapidly up- stream. If a person is seen on several dark nights mysteriously prowling about the village, not answering greetings and the like, the Indians say there is a "spy" about. The wraith is evidently an enemy shaman on one of his magical forays. A certain kind of fish, Gitci'gi'w6liahit, big tickler (fish), is a being friendly to man. They tell a story of a young man who was abandoned by his wife to starve on an island in the bay. Soon after he was deserted a fox appeared and told him not to fear, that someone would soon come and relieve him. He was told to keep close watch. Before long a large fish approached the shore, the man got up on its back and was carried safely to the mainland. Pukdjinskwe's-u, jug woman, or scab woman, is another creature of the forest. She is an old woman, foolish, and with a repulsive appear- ance. The Jack-in-the-Pulpit plant is called "Jug Woman's baby," and is correctly regarded as poison. Jug Woman figures prominently in mythology. Her personal qualities are hard to define, although consid- erable is told of her. Old women in the village whose actions and words seem foolish earn the nickname of Pukdjinskwe's'u. Wi-wil'y~mekew, tickler fish, is the snail, who has special supernatural gifts and is capable of living either in the water, on land, or in the trees. Besides these supernatural beings, there are certain mysterious local phenomena like the series of markings on a rock by the river between Bucksport and Bangor. Here the old Indians came, to divine from the markings which were constantly changing. BEITEFS Concepts of the Universe: No true creation myths appear. The world and the universe are thought to have existed always in their present general shape. The earliest mythical period presents a world peopled by</page><page sequence="18">1 8 _ournal of American Folk-Lore. creatures vaguely human and animal in form, having individual rather than class characteristics. At a subsequent period Gluskabe appeared, and introduced a new mythological epoch. He transformed the creatures of the universe into their present forms, in the interests of man or through the selfish motives typical of the American transformer. This transformation of charac- teristics rather than matter is a prominent feature of Penobscot cosmog- ony, the same applying apparently to the other Wabanaki tribes. The culture hero journeyed by river and coast through the tribal habitat performing his exploits. The next period is the present, in which men and animals are thor- oughly differentiated, some individuals in both kingdoms retaining the shamanistic power which was common to nearly all in the preceding epoch. Free communication between the mundane and the supernatural spheres, and between human beings and animals has almost ceased in this epoch, leaving only Gluskabe and the shamans to act as inter- mediaries. The origin of various supernatural creatures is also traced to this epoch. Apparently the Indians think that this period is now nearing its close, because the prophecies regarding the coming of the whites and the decline of the Indians have come true. As was foretold, when Gluskabe has been almost forgotten he will return, accompanied by a great commotion, and restore old conditions. The upper or sky realm is peopled by supernatural personifications. Some are in sight overhead in the shape of stars and constellations. Others like Gluskabe occupy remote parts invisible to all except those who have magic means of transportation. The various beings are in general given the honorific term of "grandfather." The stars are supernatural beings called awa"tawe's-u, "far off over- head being." The heavens are spdmki-k, "above country." Here the spirits of the dead souls (ntci-dja"kcw, "my soul")' enjoy a detached existence as stars, if we accept the inference to be drawn from comparative studies of the Algonkian soul concept. The term wule'wzeqan, "goodness," is also applied to soul. There is no direct teaching as to the abode of human spirits after death, but in one of the important explanatory tales, Seventh-Son and Fond-of-Traveling, it is told that the ghosts of men reside in a distant land where winter and summer alternate every seven years, where the shades live in a village surrounded by a palisade and wear garments of white hare skin. They live under the rule of a great commander. A sim- ilar conception of the abode of souls is given in the myth of Fast Runner. The camp of the dead is revealed to the hero of the tale as being located upon an island in the middle of a vast lake. It is surrounded by a pali- sade and inhabited by human souls under the rule of a chief named 1 In Penobscot the term is not associated with "breath," which is nase'- wan, or "shadow," badaga"s-u.</page><page sequence="19">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 9 White Hare. His subjects have been deprived of their brains in order that they may forget the world and not desire to return. They are clad in white hareskin garments. Every seven years the location of this tribe of the dead is changed to another site inaccessible to all but those sent thither. The associations all point to a much-discussed element of northern Algonkian mythology, the legend of the White Hare. This important tale has many analogues in Algonkian mythology, yet its religious significance is still far from clear in spite of the attention it has received. A world underneath this earth was believed in, ala'mki-k, "inside country,"' where several classes of spirits dwell in reptile form, the arch-enemies of man and of his protectors, the Thunders. The third realm is the earth, wski't'ka'mikew, "top land." This is thought to be flat and surrounded by the ocean, "great salt water," ktci-sobe'kcw, beyond which are other islands and countries inhab- ited by tribes of strangers. Like other Indian tribes, when first encountered the Penobscot evidently had some expectation of meeting a light-skinned people from across the waters. Their prophets had warned them against such a race, in consequence of which the first Europeans seen with Captain Weymouth in Penobscot Bay were not amicably received. Foreign intercourse figures largely in various native legends and naturally became more prominent in folklore as intimacy between the Indians and Europeans progressed. The Milky Way, keta'yk'su audi"', "spirit path," is the trail over which ghosts of the dead travel on their way to the realm of spirits. The comet or meteor is wesAkwundhit (awa"tawe's'u), "tailed (star)." It is regarded as a sign of an approaching calamity in the quarter whence the comet is seen. The Indians remember a great comet seen in the south, not long after which the Civil War broke out. Again not many years ago a meteor or comet was seen just over the falls in the river below Indian Island, and within a few days a canoe containing two people was carried over the falls. Falling stars, they believe, also portend bad luck. The constellation Ursa Major, or Great Dipper, is called awe"s-us, "bear," and comprises the four stars of the dipper. The stars imme- diately behind it are hunters and the following belief centers about it :2 The bear was trying to escape from a hunter who followed him until about the middle of September. In the meantime the chickadee with a kettle or dipper on his back was keeping close behind the hunter. When the hunter overtook the bear he put an arrow through the bear's heart. As the blood fell from his side, the chickadee filled his dipper until the blood overflowed and when it fell to the earth it reddened the leaves as we now see them in autumn. The white grease then dripping from the bear's body became snow upon the earth - whence winter. 1 The word now denotes hell. 2 An interesting resume of comparative Micmac and Iroquois legend concerning this star group is given by S. Hagar, JAFL 13: 92. 2*</page><page sequence="20">20 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. The north star is msa'"tawe, "large star," which the Indians regard as their guide. The morning star is nicknamed the "late one," i. e. the last to betake himself home in the morning. They claim that his delay is caused partly by lingering to adjust his coat. Another constellation, according to some, the Pleiades, is called mada'wi'le, "loon." The origin of this is given in a myth relating how a man fell in love with his cousin and married her against tribal custom. For punishment the girl's brothers pursued him and were about to kill him when he fell through the ice and rose to the sky in the form of a loon and became a star. The Pleiades are mndbasuwak, "grouped together." The sun, gi'zo's, was thought to come up through a hole in the ocean on the eastern edge of the world. The moon is ni'b6's'it, "night walker," or ni'bo's'it gi'z6's, "night- walker sun." The thunders, beda'gi'ak, are also anthropomorphic supernatural beings. They are three giant brothers (one tale gives seven) whose missiles are in the lightning, basdkcwla's'wak. These missiles are flint or meteoritic stones which are thought to be discharged into the ground or into trees when the thunders are pursuing their old enemies, the giant underwater turtles or reptiles. Another tale states that lightning is caused by the brothers opening their eyes. The Indians think that the lightnings are most frequently discharged into lakes where the thunders see the monsters beneath the water. To find one of these "thunder stones," beda'gi" a'pus, or to dig one out of the ground is thought to bring very good luck. Thunder and lightning, like rain, winter and other nature personifications, are called mi'sumas, grandfather. As the thunder and lightning are feared on account of their discharges, people offer a sacrifice of tobacco to them, burning it in the fire. When particularly frightened by the nearness of the uproar the following prayer is shouted: "Pema'gikcw, pema'gikcw. no'"socsno'gak da'li" ni'gdt'ha'nogak Hurry past, hurry past. Our relatives there we left them behind ni'sa'p'skwi-kdk." on the ledges [out to sea]." Which means: "Hurry by, hurry by, there are only a few of us here. If you want to hurt us, we left a lot more of our people out on the ledges at sea where you will find them if you hurry." It is needless to add in explanation that the supplicants are merely trying to deceive the thunders and send them off on a false quest. Sheet lightning, ela"tawe gi'pozi-'dit, "light quavering," is a personi- fication entirely separated from the above. About clouds, aso'"k', there seems to be nothing in common belief indicating animate personality.</page><page sequence="21">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 2 I The lunar or solar eclipse is called se'k'we, "something in pain." It is believed that the luminary is sick. If it were not to recover, the world would become totally dark. The northern lights are called ni'bo'ban, "night light," but no fable has been found attached to the display. The whirlwind, ko'kew or abaldsamwe"s'u, is another evil personifica- tion; a cyclone is the same, qualified by k'tci', "big." The rainbow, mana'gwan, is considered nothing more than a sign of clearing after a storm. The earthquake, ma't'gami" gi- "pode, "earth mass shaken," is attrib- uted to madjiaha'n'do, "evil spirit," who turns over where he lives beneath the earth every few years, causing the world to quake. The echo is ba'gadakwe'wele, "sound returning." The cardinal points have descriptive not personal names, though the directions at times become personifications as we learn in the myths. They are: pabu'nki" north "winter land" wedji'sa'ki-'posit (gi'z6's) east "(sun) comes up from" wedji'sa'khi'Iat sawana'"ki "south land" ni'buna"ki" south "summer land" ba' skwena' wak "noon time" lagwi'nduk (gizos)ak west "(sun) going down" The winds, however, are quite definitely personifications and are given in the following table. Wind in general is "fast wind," gesela'- m~san, pso"s'an north wind, "coming from snow wind" nala'tagwe'"san northeast wind, "up river wind" (p)mso'"s'an east wind, "great wind" wetci-'be southeast wind, "dripping wet from" sawa'nes'an south wind, "south wind" sanu'tsega'dan southwest wind, "(blowing) along shore" k'ska"s'an west wind, "wide wind" ni'bani" k'ska"s'an northwest wind, "summer wide wind" t'kela'm's-an "cold wind" a'badela'm's-an "warm wind" They are known as dominating spirits, all having their own modes of behavior. The southwest wind spirit brings terrific storms; the north, the cold; the east, rain; and so forth. They figure in mythology as rulers of human and animal destiny.</page><page sequence="22">22 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. The short spell of warm hazy weather (Indian summer), coming sometimes in November, the Penobscot call a'lnabai ni''bgn, "a person's summer," or "Indian summer." This season was originally provided, they believe, in behalf of a man who, having been sick during the summer planting season, besought aid. A short temporary summer was created for him during which to raise a magic crop. Among the other personifications of nature are wulgi-'skat', "good weather," madfjigi-'skat, "bad weather," of which furthermore there are the various degrees, as aso"kat, "cloudy day." We also have snow storm, blizzard and similar natural phenomena. The winds and con- ditions listed above are also termed "grandfathers." Among other fabulous conceptions personifying the forces behind natural phenomena we learn in the myths of a Snow Bird, dwelling on the top of a mountain, which causes the snowfall by shedding its down, and the Eagle on the same mountain that holds up its wings to cause daylight and folds them to bring on darkness. The cruel and relentless winter giant, Great White Hare, on the same peak reigning over his kingdom of hares; White Bear; Big Screech Owl; the unfriendly Cyclopean father of Gluskabe far in the south; his weeping, tender- hearted grandmother, Woodchuck, who never leaves him; and his uncle, Turtle, that jolly and amorous dupe, are the figures elaborated upon in the tales of creation and transformation. Some of them seem to be prototypes of the existing animals, and others are more nearly nightmare embodiments of evil. Omens and Taboos concerning Animals:' The Penobscot shared the belief with other northeastern groups that their proper source of nourishment lay in the flesh of wild animals of the herbivorous group, this being to them "pure food." In contrast to the use of the term by the peoples across the St. Lawrence north of them, the Penob- scot term pilsi" means fresh, not necessarily pure in a ritual sense, hence in Penobscot pilsi" wi'-s is fresh meat. The animals are highly endowed creatures with characteristic powers and their own different modes of life. The various kinds constitute tribes and have chiefs and shamans among them. There is, for instance, the tribe of beavers whose habits are of a distinct character. They have their own villages and carry on a social life like that of the Indians. Their shamans are like the Indian shamans, able to perform acts of magic, often transforming themselves into human beings to achieve some particular object as, for example, to entice Indians away. Then there are the bears, the deer, and the moose folk, the dog, the fox, the muskrat, 1 Some superstitions and facts of Penobscot natural history, summarizing the lore of birds and reptiles, form the content of several articles which have appeared separately as follows: F. G. Speck, Bird Lore of the Northern Indians, Public Lectures of the University of Pennsylvania, Vol. VII, 1921; F. G. Speck, Reptile Lore of the Northern Indians, JAFL 36:273-</page><page sequence="23">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 23 the shark, the clams, the whale, the fish, and the insects, spider and ant, and the tortoise tribes, concerning which stories are told. Most of these tales relate how Indians encountered them in different guises. According to native philosophy, the predatory life of the Indians, their preying upon animals, and the animals upon each other, is a process of ordained killing. The animals know beforehand when they are to be slain, when their spirits have been overcome by the hunter's personal power or by magic. They exact also a certain respect, which is shown to them in different ways, though generally by the proper treatment of their remains after they have been killed for their flesh or skins. If this respect is not accorded to them, the animals refuse to be killed, or their souls may not be reborn. Consequently the carcasses of all animals not eaten are, or were until lately, hung up in trees near the scene of killing, or disposed of in some other conventional way. Upon nearly every abandoned camp-site of the older period may be found the remains of game thus disposed of. I have found weasel, rabbit (northern hare), woodchuck, muskrat, and porcupine skulls. The skeletal part is generally left hanging or lying somewhere about the camp out of reach of disturbers. To throw the carcass or bones carelessly into a stream is especially offensive to the land-dwelling animals because the bones drifting down- stream apprise so many creatures of the neglect. The bones of aquatic animals, however, must be thrown back into the water, each creature returning to its own element to be reborn there. The carcasses of mink and other fur-bearing animals not usually eaten were generally gutted when their skins had been removed, as though they were to be eaten. It was thought more respectful to animals to eat them than to throw away their bodies. An old custom of respect for the mink and his kind, still observed by some hunters, is to split the carcass down the center after it has been skinned and leave it hanging in the branches of a tree. This insures a plentiful supply of mink. Another method of securing good luck in hunting was to wear the tip end of an otter's tail attached to a cord around the neck. Hallowell' gives my earlier Penobscot information concerning the hunter's treatment of the bear. Subsequently I obtained more details from old Hemlock Joe, then about ninety years of age. There is nothing in Penobscot belief about the bear not shared by the northern Algonkian in general, but much that is wanting due to the decline of pagan beliefs in the tribe. The material is now brought together in its entirety and may be summarized as follows. In the winter when the bears were denned it is said that the she-bear held the sole of her foot toward the entrance to keep hunters from 1 A. I. Hallowell, Bear Ceremonialism in the Northern Hemisphere. American Anthropologist, n. s., vol. 28, 1926, pp. 44, 136.</page><page sequence="24">24 7ournal of American Folk- Lore. finding her. A thick smoke was supposed to rise from a hole above the he-bear's winter den, a smaller column from that of a she-bear. In hunting for bears during the winter the breathing hole was located over the den; then the hunters gathered at the spot and talked to the beast. After a little of this talk, they say, he invariably came out. As he emerged they would strike him with axes and other weapons. The belief that the hibernating bear sucks its paw is known, but some of the Indians are skeptical of its truth. It was said that dogs would not eat bear meat, though no definite reason was given. When a bear was killed the meat was dressed and the bear roasted whole, to be eaten at a feast participated in by the whole camp or village. A herald was appointed by the slayer to go through the camp calling "Kewaladdwal," "your dishes," meaning that everybody was to come and bring his eating utensils. Out of the claws and bones a necklace was made to be worn by the slayer of the bear, if he was a chief, and the hide was tanned to make a robe. In former times haddock, although plentiful in the bay, were not eaten by these Penobscot, because they believed the black stripe on each side of the fish from head to tail had been caused by Gluskabe's finger nails when he tried to seize it. The name of the haddock, djil- na'sit', "marked by the grip of fingers," refers to this legend. A little bird entering the tent or house is a sign of good luck which would be turned to bad if the creature were molested. For a hunter to see a white beaver, otter, or mink is a sign of bad luck, but if the animal can be killed it will bring good luck. A case of bad luck following the sight of a white animal was observed in the fall of 1910 when some Indians saw a pure white swallow among a flock of barn swallows. That night one of the men, who had been winning money steadily in a series of card games, lost his luck and a considerable amount of his earnings. This he attributed to having seen the white swallow. He wanted to kill it. His bad luck lasted several days. There seems, however, to be some individual interpretation of the omen of the white animal, as I have heard some argue the reverse of the above. The whip-poor-will is called wi-'pule's'u on account of its habit of saying li' puli', "discharge semen." The partridge, madj'itles'u, "bad bird," has for its cry "Ee! mas mas mas!" which means "vulva." The partridge is thought to take a long breath as he starts to fly when frightened. His sudden drop at the end of his flight is caused by his breath giving out. Even the clams, Js'ak, have their little song which they chant in accom- paniment to their squirting when the tide is ebbing, to warn big fish lest they get stranded on the shoals. In the springtime, to secure good luck for all summer, one should catch the first bumblebee seen and wrap it up in something to be carried about on the person.</page><page sequence="25">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 25 The Penobscot share the almost universal American belief that legends must not be related in summer lest snakes overhear and bite the offenders. The frog is never killed nor molested because excessive rain or drought might ensue. This belief is based upon the myth of the giant frog who once upon a time swallowed all the waters of the rivers and lakes until he was forced to disgorge by Gluskabe. Children were not allowed to make track imprints in the snow about the camps with the deer or moose hoofs lying about. Should the children trifle in this way with tracks the hunters would not get any game. It is taboo for children to mock the screech owl, kampkdm'es'u, lest he burn the offender or his camp. Even adults observe this regulation. Owls are believed to talk, answering people who mock them. The barred-owl, diktagli, is regarded as the guardian of the camp. He warns people of approaching danger, such as prowling Mohawk. In the old days his warning was highly respected. He is supposed to be saying, "diktagli skalinskul haldib," slowly in hollow tones, meaning, diktagli, buckshot; haldib, an exclamation. If a hunter shoots a bluejay it will bring bad luck to his gun. For a fox to come near the camp and howl is a sign of death for someone there. Likewise if a whip-poor-will, or a partridge, flies very near it augurs the same. The swallows are called "little thunder birds," bedagi-'les-i-s (sin- gular), and are believed to be associated with the thunders because they fly before and after storms. Consequently they are never molested. The Penobscot say that the crow knows that the Indians were the first owners of corn so nowadays when he flies over the country and sees how the white man has taken the corn he cries, "Ka ka" ("Corn! corn!") to remind him of his debt. In the spring the first small flock of wild geese comes northward as scouts. If these return, very soon another flock, the main migration, takes wing and upon their backs these geese bring the various smaller birds. This belief accounts, according to native natural history, for the sudden appearance of the song birds and warblers in the spring the day after the geese have been heard going north. The lightning bugs, basdkcwles'i's, "light creature," appearing late in the springtime are harbingers of the salmon. When they are seen the people say it is time to go salmon spearing. The tree frog's voice in the woods in autumn is the sign to go moose calling. The chipmunk comes out from his winter sleep at the same time as the bear. Upon his appearance they say spring has arrived and it is time to hunt bear. Fleas are said to be beneficial to the health as they draw out bad blood. They say that the ancient war waged between the turtle and the thunders is still kept up at times. Often when a thunderstorm comes</page><page sequence="26">26 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. up the snakes and the turtles come out to fight their enemy. This explains the common belief that if a turtle bites a person he will not let go his hold until it thunders, for the reason that his enemy is then coming along.1 When the plumage of the partridge is noticed to be particularly thick in the summertime, it is a sign of a severe winter. When muskrats are being cleaned for cooking, the eyes are thrown into the water or in the swamp from which they were taken. This is done to increase the supply of young muskrats. When running down game, hunters place a spruce twig under the shirt next to the skin to prevent getting a pain in the side. It brings bad luck to kill a raven. For the hunter about to start out it is a very good sign to see a whis- key-jack (Canada jay). He knows that he will secure a quantity of game. The northern hare, a creature thought to be connected with the mythical Great White Hare who dominates the north, is associated with blizzards. He is said to sit in his "squat" and pass pellets of excrement as the snowflakes float down past him, counting out one for each snow- flake. There was formerly a tendency to torment birds. Adults incited little boys to shoot song-birds while these were pouring forth their richest notes, merely for the boys to exercise their marksmanship. Such behav- ior was applauded for the reason that it trained children to be in- different to the sufferings of game. It was thought that when a bird was singing happily it was a sign that someone was going to die. To avert the evil they would try to wound or kill the bird, then take the creature, open its bill and spit in its mouth, saying, "He is causing sickness!" The legendary monsters encountered and killed by Gluskabe have sometimes been interpreted as references to the American mastodon. While the Penobscot description of the animal denotes one of elephantine proportions with jointless legs and long teeth, the name it bears in Naskapi means "the stiff (legged) bear." In Penobscot it is K'tci-awa's, Great Beast, the term implying relationship with the bear, awd's'us. I have previously discussed the essentials of this tradition in an article in the Pennsylvania Gazette.2 The animals figuring chiefly as performers and transformers or tricksters are: 1 References to the Thunder Bird concept in North America are given by T.

This reverence is felt in certain stories told by hunters concerning their adventures in the woods. Some years ago I was off alone hunting in the woods in a remote part of the country. I began to grow very lonesome, thinking a great deal about my wife and child. I had only a short time before lost a child that I loved. I felt that something might have gone wrong. One day I killed a porcupine not because I needed the meat but just because I happened to meet with it. I had no sooner struck the animal than it turned upon me a look that made me feel sorry. I thought I could see in its eyes the very expression of my youngest baby, the one who had died. I felt badly and decided then that something had gone wrong with my family. So I packed up my camp and returned home. But before starting I took the tail of the porcupine and made a hair-brush and comb-cleaner of it that I still keep.1 Upon arriving home I found some of my family sick. Since then I have never had the heart to kill another porcupine, for when I see one it reminds me of my dead child. Joe Francis, an old hunter, related his experiences upon a hunting trip near Mt. Katahdin. He had captured a beaver cub from a den in which he had killed the mother. The cub was born immediately after he had killed the mother. He took the cub to his camp, fed it upon meal and water from a little vial and allowed it to sleep next him every night, during the day leaving it wrapped sleeping in his blankets. For some time things went well, the young beaver growing big and strong. He became greatly attached to it, as it kept him from getting lonesome during his trip. It used to play during the night by piling up his goods against the camp door, as though it were making a dam. Soon, however, his meal gave out and he had to change the food. As the cub was still too young to search for its own food he tried prepared flour of which little was left. Then the creature sickened and died. He felt very lonesome and bereaved, broke up camp and returned home. After this he never wanted to kill a beaver again. The same attitude is present in the story of the bear family where, through association with a family of bears, an individual and his descend- ants developed a feeling of relationship with the bear kind. A similar case is encountered in the narrative of the hunter who mated with a doe, later betrayed and killed her, and acquired the taboo against killing deer thereafter. The Game Owner Concept: Of the game owner or controller, so widely known among the northern Algonkian as well as among the northeastern 1 This is the toilet article universal among northern Algonkian tribes.</page><page sequence="28">28 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. Asiatics, there are but few indications in Penobscot folklore. In the narrative of Snowy Owl and the Great Beasts, we are told of a Great White Hare who dwells on a mountain top surrounded by eternal snow where no traveler can approach him and live. He dominates a realm consisting of brainless hares, transformed victims of a witch who has combed out their brains to eat them. Gluskabe subdues the Great White Hare and releases the hares to return to earth and provide a food supply for the Indians. Again in another myth, Skunk Visits Gluskabe on Grassy Mountain, there is a reference to strange animals dwelling on a mountain top, supposedly animal ghosts, the spirits of the hunting grounds. These allusions may be faint reflections of a belief that the tribes of game animals had their overlords who were responsible for their fate and distribution in the world. Power of Wish: Among Algonkian tribes in general the belief in accomplishing the fulfillment of desire through the simple power of wish seems to be fundamental. It occurs often in the hero-tales. The term denoting it is udli-daha'man with the meaning "to wish for a purpose." The practice has long been out of use.' Divination: Of scrying or lecanomancy there were the following bird, beaver, muskrat and fish practices. The amount of blood flowing from freshly hooked fish was significant. If the flow was copious the augury was good for the ensuing fishing operations. If hooked fish did not bleed much at the wound the sign was an unfavorable one. From the St. Francis Abenaki, Penobscot, and Malecite there is good evidence of the former practice of divination by means of the shoulder-blade and pelvis-bone of the muskrat and beaver. The descrip- tion of these almost forgotten rites is as follows: The little shoulder-blade of the muskrat, the breast-bone of duck or partridge, if spotted with dark spots, presumably blood, denote good luck in the chase. The hind hip-bone with round opening is held in the right hand, both hands are dropped down on each side. Then the hunter to find out if he is going to have any trouble in finding a certain stream, or hunting place, will say as he slowly raises it above his head, "To Birch Stream (or any stream) I am going." By the time he says these words his finger of the left hand has either hit the opening or missed it - if he hits it right, no trouble to find the stream or hunting ground; Kadi'- gwelmagwebana, "we shall have good luck."2 Dreams, Amulets, Omens and Some Special Taboos: A dream, elkwdsi', was a warning from the supernatural, and was, moreover, a command. Whatever was dreamed had to be carried out by the dreamer, or he 1 Nicolar (op. cit., pp. 37-39) gives instances of Gluskabe's wish power. See also F. G. Speck, Wawenock Myth Texts from Maine, Forty-third Annual Report Bureau American Ethnology, Wash. 1928, p. 18o. 2 Correspondence Roland Nelson, April 22, 1928 and Dec. 1925.</page><page sequence="29">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 29 lost his spiritual power. To dream of a bear meant that the bear had to be hunted. To dream of traveling on the water meant sickness. To dream of having a hard time swimming in the water and getting out was an omen of severe illness but of final recovery. To dream of white animals was a sign of good fortune but to dream of black animals was bad. Black and white are commonly important in dreams. Sometimes when a person wakes up with a start, having imagined that something took hold of him, he will say that a shaman's (madiolinu) spirit was meddling with him. Various fetishes, charms, songs, prescribed actions, and taboos were employed in nearly every field of Penobscot life, particularly in hunting. The wulilmugwe, "good coming to a person" or "good luck," concept is most important in Penobscot religion, having reference to good health, abundance, peace, success, victory, immunity and the like in every branch of life. It is the main object of the restrictive taboos, amulets, prescribed regulations, omens and so on. Its antithesis is madji'dl- mugwe, "bad luck." An amulet is generically termed wuldlmugwe'i'gan, "good luck instrument." A string of red beads worn about the throat was common with nearly all women several generations ago, but by 1913 only one or two were in use. This necklace, aside from the ornamental value it possesses, was specifically a charm against excessive bleeding and kept the blood pure. An example obtained from an aged woman has six strings of beads and was worn tight around the neck. Stones with holes in them, natural or drilled, are prized as amulets and were anciently worn about the neck attached by a leather string. A disk-like perforated pebble, part of the paraphernalia of a medicine practitioner, has been described in my study of Penobscot shamanism. Several perforated stones are figured having been obtained from old people, one evidently an archaeological object and serving probably also as a rubbing stone. Hunters carried a piece of bone about four inches long taken from a moose's neck as a hunting amulet. Penis bones of bear and raccoon were also kept by hunters for good luck. On several occasions I have discovered bone dice, used in the dice and bowl game, cherished as pocket pieces for good luck in hunting. A small curiously formed bone not more than three fourths of an inch long found in the head of a codfish is another good luck charm. Referring to the natives of the Kennebeck river (Abenaki) we read in the Jesuit Relations: "There are few young men among the savages who have not some stone or other thing, which they keep as a token of dependence upon the Demon in order to be happy in the hunt, or in play, or in war. It is either given them by some sorcerer, or they dream that they will find it in some place, or their imagination makes them</page><page sequence="30">30 o7ournal of American Folk-Lore. believe that the Manitou represents to them what they encounter."' These fetishes, the account states, they carried in their pouches. One aspect, at least, of the amulet concept is denoted by the term ngdskamazi-,2 "I find something unexpectedly." This is a somewhat conventional term referring either concretely to the amulet found under conditions which bring good luck, or in general to an event of this kind. The term for acquiring some magic good-luck bringer, as well as for the object itself, is giskamazi-t. The concept carries less of the notion of individual property among the Penobscot than it does among the Malecite and Micmac. A man among the Penobscot finds an object which he has reason to think will bring him good luck, takes the object and keeps it as his fetish or giskamazi-t, with little attempt at secrecy. All Penobscot fetishes seem to be of general efficiency to anyone who employs them. The stone pipe was used as a divination charm. When a man left home for the hunt or war, he might leave a stone pipe in the care of his wife. As long as it remained empty it was a sign that he was all right, but should it appear with blood it signified that he had died. This device is mentioned in the tale of Long Hair. A snakeskin headband is thought to have power to drive away one's enemies. A little remembrance is sometimes given to a friend to cause the receiver to dream about the giver. A girl may, for example, present some man with a miniature basket that she has made. A magic plant called mede'"pudek, "rattling noise," is believed to give forth a rattling sound at intervals. The root of this plant is an agent of good luck to anyone who, hearing its noise, secures it as an amulet. Another such object is efficacious in protecting a person from injuries in war and is said to possess power to cure sickness. It is a growth shaped like a carrot and found on pine trees, they say, and it moans at inter- vals. A Penobscot who went to the Civil War was given one of these charms by his father with instructions to keep it fresh as a safeguard. The man used to scrape it occasionally to freshen its power, and thanks to it he returned home safely after the war was over. A most interesting fetish is the first vertebra of the deer. This bone has a projection like a nose and two eye holes and is believed to be a human being, hence its name wski-dambdwit,3 "becomes a person." At times when a deer is killed this bone is removed, cleaned and put away to keep good luck. Its origin is explained by a story of a hunter who 1 Jesuit Relations, Vol. XXXI, 1647, p. 191. 2 mdskaman, to go find something; geskaman, to stumble upon something unexpectedly. 3 It is interesting to note that this name has a Passamaquoddy sound to Penobscot ears; the Penobscot equivalent would be senqbdwit.</page><page sequence="31">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 3 for many years cleaned the bone and laid it away each time he killed a deer, on account of its resemblance to a human face. Some years after- wards while trying to spear beaver he fell through a hole into deep mud and would have drowned but for a strange man who mysteriously appeared and rescued him. The stranger disclosed his identity as the bone which the hunter had always respected, giving his name as wski'- dambiwit. Henceforth hunters followed the same practice. The following beliefs have been noted from various Penobscot in- formants: The seventh son of a family is thought to be gifted with a knowledge of medicinal herbs and the magic of healing. The magic number in Penobscot lore seems to be seven, the same applying to other Wabanaki tribes. The Indians themselves are quite unconscious of a ritual or symbolic function in the number seven, its occurrence being part of the formula in folk-tale repetitions and numerical combinations in general. It is believed that when someone in the village, particularly a rela- tive, is about to die, manifestations in the shape of grippings on arm or shoulder appear. A number of anecdotes relating to this phenomenon are current on the island. Ghosts are frequently thought to appear in the smoke of the camp fire. Three shots from a gun are supposed to drive them away perma- nently. Humanly formed creatures of a fiery appearance are seen walking about where calamities are going to occur. Many claim to have witnessed this. When a new unused basket is lying around it is a sign of good luck if someone throws or drops something into it. When one's moccasin lacings become untied they say, "Your lover is thinking of you." When paring the finger nails the trimmings are gathered and burned. If this is not done it is believed that after death the spirit will become a wanderer seeking the lost parts. Possession of them is thought to give the holder a certain power over the original owner. For a woman to bear twins, dagawe"s'uwak, "double beings," is good luck. When a person yawns, someone nearby will try to snap his fingers in the open mouth. No explanation is current for this. If a person stubs his toe on anything he will turn back and walk over the place again to avert bad luck. Whenever a man emits wind in public those nearby never miss the opportunity of commenting humorously on what the expression means, taking the noise to be in the nature of an oracular utterance. A curious piece of folklore about the Passamaquoddy current among the Penobscot is understandable perhaps if one is familiar with Indian ways and humor. They say that the former when they go out to the</page><page sequence="32">32 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. desolate island off Passamaquoddy Bay, known as Grand Manaan (Ktci'mena'an, Big Island), to hunt seals and porpoises, leave their women because the journey is a rough and dangerous one in canoes. But the men let their finger nails grow long so that they can scratch their bodies and smell their fingers to remind them of home! The old Penobscot had a superstition against ascending to the top of Mt. Katahdin because so many spirits live there capable of inflicting harm, besides Pemuile and the local genius. Hunters and travelers who have come from the neighborhood of Mt. Katahdin continually report hearing the noise of singing and dancing issuing from the cliffs. The Indians formerly had aversions to ascending all mountains for similar reasons, as it was thought best to avoid spirit or demon-haunted localities. Springs are likewise haunted by particular local spirits, for which reason it was formerly the rule, and still is with some, to make an offering of tobacco when drinking at remote springs in the woods. Bread must not be eaten in the morning by one who intends to cut birch-bark for canoes or utensils, lest the bark be "bad," that is, spoiled by holes, knots, or "crows" as they call them. To eat the lumps in corn pudding for breakfast would likewise beget "burls" or lumps in the bark. Soup must not be eaten in the morning when one intends to go fishing for eels. Women, particularly young girls, were never supposed to cross the path of a hunter as it would weaken him on his journey and spoil his luck. The taboo is of extra force during their catamenial periods. If a death occurs in the village during a dance the performance has to be stopped, as no dancing may go on while a corpse lies unburied. Weather Signs: The following opinions regarding weather conditions are current. Some are evidently based on experience and deliberate observation, applying only to weather conditions in the Penobscot val- ley, while others are based on folklore. They are important matters to the Indians who hunt, being closely associated with religion in the sense that the climatic conditions are governed by supernatural agencies who are working with or against them. The weather terms are: so'glan rain "pours out" psan' snowing "fills up" wazoc'li snow on the ground wa'"sa shower wazali-a'skat frost "snow like" (?) kebe'uska't dew "water like" (?) a'wan mist bazega'wan fog "dark mist" pekwa'mi" ice asu' 'k cloud a'wani'be dripping fog "mist water"</page><page sequence="33">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 33 When frost is visible in the air on a clear day in winter, as sometimes happens, it is a sign of rain or snow. Also when there is a pink hue in the east toward the sea in winter, a great snowstorm is approaching. A coming is foretold by excessive crackling and bursting of wood in the fire. When an animal, particularly an owl, is seen scratching its head it is a sign of rain. The owl is thought to be a dependable weather prophet. When birds are seen taking a bath it signifies the same. In the springtime whenever northern tlights appear they say a windy day will follow. If the lights flicker there will be a strong and steady wind, if they are still it will be squally. I have observed the apparent truth of this saying a number of times. The rainbow denotes clearing off, miiskwat'. They also think that the tides influence storms, that a flood tide will bring a storm if one is brewing nearby, and an ebb tide will hold it back. The chirping of the tree frog they take as a sign of coming damp weather. Once when a big ring was observed around the moon, I was told that "the big bear (constellation Ursus Major) was fenced in and could not get out." This portended rain. Sun dogs, abas-e'ndan, "middle" (probably referring to the centering of the sun's reflections), also, "the doorway," are a sign of storm: rain in summer, snow in winter. The storm will come from the quarter where the ring encircling the sun is broken, is the saying. Fine dry falling snow is referred to as "partridge feathers," possibly referring to the legend of the bird on the fabulous mountain whose shed feathers descend to earth as snow, though it is said to be merely descrip- tive. When loons cry at night the wind will blow next day from the quarter opposite to that from which they are heard. If the cries come from the opposite side of a lake it will blow from thence since loons seek a lee shore before the wind rises. Trees cracking in extremely cold winter weather foretell a sudden thaw. II. PENOBSCOT TALES The following collection of myths and tales is the accumulation of material recorded in the course of field work on the general ethnology of the Penobscot Indians. All of the more important trickster-trans- former and origin myths were taken down in text from the dictation of Newell Lion, some of which have already appeared.' The stories in this present collection have been obtained at different times from 1 International Journal of American Linguistics, New York, vol. I, no. 3, 1918. F. G. Speck, Penobscot Transformer Texts, dictated by Newell Lion. See also F. G. Speck, Wawenock Myth Texts from Maine, Forty-third Annual Report Bureau American Ethnology, Wash. 1928. 3</page><page sequence="34">34 _ournal of American Folk-Lore. different informants. Among these should be mentioned the names of Governor (Chief) Piel Nicola, Governor Joe Francis, Joe Solomon, "Buck" Andrew, Charley "Daylight," Mrs. Alice Swassion, "Big Frank" Dana (Denis), Governor Newell Francis, Joe Francis, John Neptune, Governor Sabatis Francis, John Susup and Gabe Paul. The Penobscot tales fall into several classes. The first comprises the trickster cycle, in which Gluskc'be figures as the chief personage. Another category embraces origin myths, another the miscellaneous animal stories widespread over the continent. The animal tales show some local coloring, to be sure, but little that is really distinctive. The human stories which form another group are somewhat more charac- teristic of the eastern region. They include mostly accounts of old people or orphans who are abandoned, kidnapped, or lost in the woods. Besides these there are numerous tales about shamans, war, hunting, and the like. A considerable number of the tales in the collection were recorded in text, as is indicated in the footnotes, and such tales may be noted as contrasting in style with those others not so recorded. Variants of a few animal tales have already been published in a short paper,' and the shamanistic tales in my discussion of shamanism.2 Certain widespread story motives I repeatedly inquired about and failed to find. Such were the snaring of the sun, the deluge, the earth- diver, the origin of the marks on the bark of the birch (present in neigh- boring Wawenock) and the toothed vagina. A person accustomed to tell stories or legends, at'l6'kqgan (in the singular), is called nuddt'ld'git, "one who yarns or stories." Such people were thought to become lucky. A famous one was ktcinuddit'16git, "great story teller." There are some interesting conventions in the beginnings and endings of myths. Story tellers who are about to narrate myths having human beings as heroes often employ the following formal introduction: Wdudjo'set ndatU6'kcgan bi'zwakdmi-gwi- dlnqbe That was walking along my story a wilderness lodge man dles'd'kami-gwi-ye udldgwede'wcxgan bi-mi-sigRni-gdni-ye of sheets of moss his clothing of withes shreds agwadagwdbi-zun. his belt. Free Translation: "My story was walking along, a wilderness house man, his clothing was made of sheets of moss, and shreds of withes formed his belt." 1 Penobscot Tales, JAFL, vol. XXVIII, no. cvii, 1915. 2 Penobscot Shamanism, Memoirs of the American Anthropological Association, vol. VI, no. 3, 1920.</page><page sequence="35">Penobscot Tales and Reiigious Beliefs. 35 This implies that the story is so ancient that the hero belonged to an earlier age when the Indians wore only moss and such things for clothes. Another formal opening for a long and complete story is Wcwwigit ndattld'kgan, "Here lives my story." During the narration the listeners give utterance to he! which is taken by the teller as a sign of interest. If the listeners do not do this every little while the teller thinks they do not care for the tale and is displeased. Laughing and exclamations are also appreciated. When the story is at an end the teller closes with "Neddli me'tabigazu," "There is the end," or more formally, "Ni-a nudji-'madjin," "I left then," or, "Thereupon I departed," as though he had been a witness to the event and related only what he saw. A still more conventional ending for stories of human actions, the quasi-historical tales, is "Ni'iina nawa'wi'gi'ndna nddali me'tabigazu," "We (the heroine and I) lived there (then together), there is the end." By this the narrator jocularly assumes that, if the hero or heroine be attractive, he lived with him or her for a period. The traditional belief is that stories told in the summer cause snakes to bite the teller. When eating stewed muskrats, as the Indians do repeatedly in the spring, they laugh when anyone takes the head from the dish and say he has to tell a story for that. Story telling is a favorite pastime. The tellers usually receive tobacco before they begin, and light up a pipe for the occasion. Quantities of smoke are inhaled and expelled with vehemence until often the reciter is almost hidden in clouds of smoke. Under ordinary circumstances, in camp or in the village, the men engage in story telling as a pastime while they are en- joying an after-dinner smoke. Let an evening fireside group start conversation on some happening about the village, and by the most natural stages the topic eases off into story telling. Someone will compare the event with some hearsay, another will tell what he was told once, and soon the original issue is lost sight of in a round of traditional stories and myths. All in all, I should note, the Penobscot narrators are humorous-minded, whether or not it becomes apparent in the tales themselves. A spirit of humor actually dominates the majority of narrations and in weak disguise pervades the rest. It is thought fitting that modesty be expressed on the score of story telling and men often claim that they cannot tell the story as it deserves, though nevertheless they manage to get through with it. On the other hand, as Rasmussen records of the Polar Eskimo, some of the Penobscot story tellers like to give the impression that, if they only felt like doing themselves justice, they could keep on recounting tales for several days. "My frien'," says one, "we ought to have all night to get to the bottom of that story, but I have given it to you the best I could without any help." Again they say, when telling about the visits of friends, "After 3*</page><page sequence="36">36 5Tournal of American Folk-Lore. dinner we began telling stories." The characters used in denoting native sounds are those explained in the introduction to the Penobscot Trans- former Texts op. cit.

She raised him and taught him everything; how to hunt, fish, and how to make his living. When he grew large enough to use a bow and arrow, he said to his grandmother, "Make me a bow and arrows, I want to hunt deer, I am already tired of rabbit's meat and fish." Then he roamed away and killed a deer and she was glad. She was very proud of him. The next day he roamed and killed a bear. "What creature is it ?" he asked her when he brought it home. She was glad and began to dance. "You've killed a bear, a great piece of meat. Now we shall have plenty of fat. We shall live richly," said she. "He will be a great magician. He will do great wonders for our descendants as he goes on," she thought to herself; "because various dangers will in the future endanger their lives, different beasts will seek our lives, also rivers, and he can transform them so they will not be dangerous." Then Gluskc'be said to his grandmother, "I would like you to show me how to build a canoe so that I can hunt ducks." "Surely I will teach you, grandson!" So she taught him how to build a canoe and at last it was finished. She was glad when he paddled out to get ducks. He got a great many.</page><page sequence="39">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 39 Now at last, as time went on, the wind got so strong that he could not paddle about. He tried hunting in the woods, thinking, "Hunting is evidently very slow." So he returned to his wigwam. 2. GLUSKOCBE REILEASES THE GAME ANIMALS Then he lay down on his bedding and commenced to sing, wishing for a game-bag of hair so that he could get the beasts easier. His grand- mother Woodchuck then made him a game-bag of deer hair. When it was finished she tossed it to Glusko'be but he did not stop singing. Then again she made one of moose hair and tossed it to him, but he did. not stop. Then pulling Woodchuck hairs from her belly she made one of those. Glusko'be was indeed glad and he thanked her. Then he went into the woods and called all the animals. He said to them, "Come on, you animals, the world is coming to an end, and you animals will all perish." Then the animals of all kinds came forth and he told them, "Get inside my bag, here. In there you will not see the world come to an end." Then they entered the bag and he carried it to the wigwam. "Now, grandmother," said he, "I have brought game ani- mals. From now on we will not have such a hard time searching for game." Then Woodchuck went and saw all the different kinds of ani- mals which were in the bag. She went into the wigwam and said, "You have not done well, grandson. Our descendants will in the future die of starvation. I have great hopes in you for our descendants. Do not do what you have done. You must only do what will benefit them, our descendants." Glusko'be heeded his grandmother. He went and opened the bag and told the animals, "Go out. The danger has already gone by. Go out!" And they scattered. 3. GLUSKO'BE TRAPS ALL THE FISH He continued going about. When he returned to his wigwam he saw his grandmother fishing there. At last he thought how hard it was that she really caught so few fish. Then he thought to himself, "It would be better if I helped my grandmother, so that she would not have so hard a time fishing." Then he built a fish trap across the river at its mouth. When he had made it he left an opening half way so that the fish could enter in. Then he started out abroad upon the ocean, and shouted aloud as he moved about, saying to the fishes, "The ocean is going to run dry. The end of the world is coming, and all of you will die. Now I have managed so that you will live, all of the fish kind who hear me. Enter in my river, and you shall live, because my river will always remain. Now, all who hear me, enter." Then the fish of all kinds entered. At last this fish trap became full. Then he closed it, and there at once they remained continually. Then he went to his wigwam and said to his grandmother, "an'i'" grandma, from now on you will not have so</page><page sequence="40">40 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. hard a time fishing. You will only need to go and get whatever kind of fishes you want." Then Woodchuck went to observe what he had done. When she arrived, there was the fish trap brim full of all kinds of fish, so much so that they almost crowded each other out. Then Woodchuck went away and when she came to her wigwam, she said, "Grandson, you have not done well. All the fish will be annihilated. So what will our descendants in the future do to live? Because we have plenty of fish now, as many as we want, do you now go and let them out." So then he got up and said, "You speak truth, grandma; I will go and open it up now." 4. GLUSKO'BE TEMPERS THE WIND' Then Glusko'be overturned a rocky point and made his canoe of it. Then he went duck hunting in his hollow stone canoe. He could not kill any birds as the wind blew so hard that he could hardly paddle about. At last he suddenly grew angry, thinking, "What causes such continuous winds?" Then Glusko'be said, "Grandma, I am going to search for where the wind comes from." "It is very far," said his grandmother. "No matter how far away it is," said he, "I am going to find out who causes it. Soon I will return." He went away going against the wind, it growing stronger as he went. On the seventh day he could hardly walk, it was so strong. It blew off all his hair. Then he saw a great magic bird 1 A brief version of the above is given by A. Alger, Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 44, p. 195-6. "After this Gluskabe was out on the ocean one day and the wind blew so hard he could not manage his canoe. He had to go back to land and he asked his old grandmother, Woodchuck, what he could do. She told him to follow a certain road up a mountain. There he found an old man sitting on a rock flapping his wings (arms) violently. This was Wudjausen, the great wind blower. He begged Gluskabe to take him up higher where he could have space to flap his wings still harder. So Gluskabe lifted him up and carried him a long way. When they came over a great lake he let Wud- jausen drop into the water. In falling he broke his wings and lay there helpless. "Gluskabe went back to the sea and found the ocean as smooth as glass. He enjoyed himself greatly for many days, paddling about, but finally the water grew stagnant and thick, and a great smell arose. The fish died and Gluskabe could bear it no longer. "Again he consulted his grandmother, and she told him that he must set Wudjausen free. So once more he bore Wudjausen back to the mountain, first making him promise not to flap his wings so constantly, but only now and then, so that the Indians might go out in their canoes. Upon his consent to do this, Gluskabe mended his broken wings, but they were never quite so strong as at first, and thus we do not have such terrible winds as in the old days."</page><page sequence="41">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 41 slowly waving its wings, making the wind. When he reached the place with difficulty, he said, "Grandfather, couldn't you possibly make stronger wind?" "Grandchild, that's the best I can do," said the big bird. Then Glusko'be said, "If you could possibly sit higher up, far over there on the hill on the peak you would make it stronger." "No, grandson, I could not," said he, "I have always sat here since the be- ginning." "I will help you, grandfather," said Glusko'be. "Very well," said the bird, "if you will help me I will go because I want all who face me to have the benefit of my wind." Then Glusko'be took the big bird on his back and carried him to a high ledge and there dropped him accidentally so he suddenly broke his wing. Then Glusko'be left, and went home. "Now," said he, "I shall have good duck hunting. We shall always have a calm." Then he went out paddling. Surely it was calm. The water grew so thick with scum that he could hardly paddle. Said he, "I think I will go again there where the wind is. It is always too calm." He went to where the great bird was. The bird did not know him now when he arrived because Glusko'be's hair had already grown out again. "What has caused so much calm always, grandfather ?" asked Glusko'be of the big bird. "Simply that an ugly bald-headed man came here and wanted stronger wind. And I told him that I could not manage it, it was all I could do and he told me he would carry me to a higher place. Sure enough, he carried me, and he dropped me and broke my wing. Now I have only one wing." Then said Glusko'be, "Grandfather, I will carry you back again where you sat, and will also heal you." "Oh, grandchild," said the bird, "I would rejoice so much if you would. I am already tired of lying here." Then Glusko'be carried him and put him back where he wanted to sit and healed his wing. "Now, grandfather, try your wing." And the bird tried his wing and it was cured. Glusko'be was blown over. The bird was very glad. "You have pleased me very much, grandchild." "Now, grandfather," said Gluska'be, "don't hereafter use your wings too steadily, because our descendants can't hunt for their living when there are such continuous winds. When you move your wings our descendants can not paddle nor hunt ducks on the water. Now if possible wave your wings for a day or two, then rest a day so that our descendants can hunt ducks on the ocean." "You speak the truth, I guess, grandson. There was too much wind. From now on there will not be such violent wind." Then Glusko'be went home, and when he arrived his grandmother rejoiced. 5. GLUSKXI'BU STEALS TOBACCO Once his grandmother said to Gluskg'be, "My grandchild, we are out of tobacco." "Where does it exist ?" asked he. Woodchuck answered, "Far out on a big island in the water Grasshopper raises tobacco but he won't share it, he is so stingy and besides he is a great dangerous</page><page sequence="42">42 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. magician." "I am able to share it," said Glusko'be to his grandmother. Then he built a canoe and when it was made he pushed it off with his foot. Its first glide was as far as he could see.' It did not go fast enough, this canoe. So he made another, pushed this off, jumped in and it went twice as far, "two looks." This was not enough. Again he made one, jumped in and pushed it off. This went "three looks." Then he laughed. Then by a magic wish he wished Grasshopper to leave home so that he could secure his tobacco. When he arrived at Grasshopper's place, sure enough he was gone. Then Glusko'be took it all, even what was growing in the fields, got in his canoe, pushed it off and returned. He said to his grandmother, "I have brought tobacco. Never again will it be scarce." And they rejoiced. Then while they were talking, Grass- hopper came paddling up. He shouted and said, "You have stolen all my tobacco." Glusko'be went out to meet him. "It is true," said Gluskc'be, "I have taken all. The reason is so that in the future our descendants too can enjoy it. You do not do well to begrudge tobacco. You raise so much that you can't enjoy or use it." Grasshopper replied, "Please give me seeds so I can raise what I need." "No," said Glusko'be, "I won't give you seeds. But I will give you as much as you need for your lifetime. I will give you sufficient for life. Now open your mouth." Then he put some tobacco in his mouth. "Now you have your share." Then he took Grasshopper and split the back of his coat and said, "From now on you will have wings. Fly away, you have your share." (The grasshopper has his tobacco in his mouth, and he chews and spits it all the time as can be seen by picking him up.) 6. GLUSKO'BE FIXES THE RIVERS AND FALLS Then said Gluskc'be to his grandmother, "Now, grandmother, I am going to travel to search for and transform things so that our descendants will not have such a hard time to exist in the future. Now I leave and will inspect the rivers and lakes. I will be gone long but don't worry." Then he started off paddling and entered all the rivers emptying into the ocean. He inspected them. Wherever there were bad falls he lessened them so they would not be too dangerous for his descendants. He cleared the carrying places. Then he left his canoe upside down where it turned to stone.2 It may be seen there yet. Then he came to a village where there was no water. 7. GLUSK~'BE KILLS THE MONSTER WHO CAUSED THE WATER FAMINE Next he found a village where the people looked sickly. Then he asked them, "What has happened?" And they said that long ago the people had settled up the river and Aglobemu had forbidden them water. Some 1 "One look," a unit of distance. 2 The rock near Castine, Me., mentioned before.</page><page sequence="43">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 43 of them had died of thirst. Then when Glusko'be came there and saw his people looking so sickly, he asked them what was the trouble. They told him, "Aglabbmu has almost killed us, causing us to die of thirst. He forbids us water." Then said Gluska'be, "I will make him give you water." Then they went with the Chief to Aglabbmu, where he was. Then he (Gluskc'be) said to him, "Why do you abuse our grandchildren ? Now, on this account you will be sorry for abusing our grandchildren so; for now I will secure them water and then all will get an equal share of water." Then he grabbe.d him and broke his back. Hence, now all bullfrogs have a broken back. But even then he did not give up the water. Glusko'be took his ax and cut down a big tree, a yellow birch, cutting it so that when it fell down, it fell on Aglabbmu and killed him. That's how the Penobscot river originated. All the branches of the river became streams and they all flowed out into the big river. From this originated the main river. Then all the people were so thirsty that they jumped into the river (for a drink). Some turned into fish, frogs, and turtles; only a few survived as human beings. Now that is whence the other people came. Now that is why they inhabit the length of the Penobscot river valley, and from that their names originate. The departed relatives of some fishes turned into fish, and so they took their names from the different kinds of fish and turtles. 8. GLUSK~'BE KILLS THE MONSTER MOOSE Then Gluskc'be started out again in search of other people. He reached a large lake.' There the people said, "Our village is in great danger from a giant magic moose, for fear of whom we can hardly go hunting. He has killed many of us." "I will search for him," said Gluskc'be, "and destroy him for you." Then he started and reached the "yard" where the giant moose was and started him running. As he was following the moose, suddenly he saw a little bough shelter ahead, and a woman came walking out. It was Pukadji'nskwes'-u, Squatty Woman. Then he went right on by and did not answer her joking. Then as he went on Squatty Woman became angry and said, "You are very haughty. Now you will see!" Then she followed Gluskc'be. He went along so fast that whenever she came to an outlook she could not see him. She said, "That Gluskc'be is a very swift man." When she reached the mouth of the river looking across a rocky point she saw him going along after the moose. Then he jumped across. His dog overtook him. He said, "You sit here and watch for Squatty Woman." Accordingly the dog sat down and watched for her. When she came down to the river she saw the rocky point, and jumped across in the same place where Gluskc'be landed.2 She said, "Tci' you will soon see." Then she beheld the big dog 1 Moosehead Lake. 2 Rocks at Castine show imprints of both their snowshoes. The dog was turned to stone.</page><page sequence="44">44 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. and became disheartened, and turned back. Gluskc'be followed the moose and on the fourth day overtook him, and killed him. He took his insides out and threw them to his dog. They reached the distance of three "looks." His dog ate as far as they went. As the intestines fell in the water they turned into stone, and can still be seen at the bottom of the river. Now it is called Musi'katci-, "Moose hind parts."' Then he turned his dog into stone, and there he sits too. Then GluskC'be returned and cooked his moose meat in his kettle near the big lake. When he had eaten he turned his kettle over and left it there turned into stone. It can still be seen. It is the mountain called Kineo.2 Then he went back and told his people, his descendants, "Now I have killed the big beast. He will never bother you again." They rejoiced and said, "You have done very much for us. We thank you altogether." 9. GLUSKC'BE OVERCOME BY WINTER Then Gluskc'be went home to his grandmother. She rejoiced to see him, but said, "Grandson, I am glad you came back, as this has been a very hard winter. A great many of our descendants have starved to death. The snow was so deep the tree tops were covered." Then Gluskc'be said, "Where is that Winter?" "Very far, grandchild, no one can live there, he would freeze to death if he went there." "I will try," said Gluskc'be. "Now I want you to make snowshoes for me, two pairs netted with caribou, two with deer and two with moose skin." Then he started. First he wore out the mooseskin snowshoes, then the deerskin and last one pair of the caribou skin ones. At last it was growing still colder and he nearly wore out his last pair. Then he came to a wigwam. It was an ice house. When he went in, the door closed tight so he could not get out. GluskC'be said, "Kwe! grandfather!" At once the old man mocked him in the same voice. He was a man of ice. Then Gluskc'be said, "Grandfather, I am very cold, open the door for me." The old man mocked him in the same tones. "Grandfather, I am almost frozen," said Gluskg'be. He was mocked again. Then he froze to death. The old man threw him out and there GluskC'be lay until spring. Then he woke up. Said he, "Why there, I have been asleep." The snow wigwam was gone. Then he went back home. IO. GIUSK~'BE PUNISHES THE FOXES FOR ABUSING HIS GRANDMOTHER While he was away, the foxes had deceived his grandmother. They went to her camp and kept saying, "Grandma, I have come, your grand- son." Then whenever she looked out they pissed in her eyes, then ran away laughing. They were always plaguing her until, for her anxiety to greet him, they at last blinded her. And she gave him up for dead, 1 Cape Rosier. 2 Mt. Kineo, Moosehead Lake.</page><page sequence="45">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 4 5 because he did not return. When Gluska'be did come he said, "Grandma, open the door." But she answered, "Go away fox, you have almost killed me, so many times you have pissed on me." Gluskc'be then said, "I am no fox." She said, "You can't deceive me any more." "I am no fox, grandmother," said Gluskc'be, "hold out your hand." Then he took her hand and she cried she was so glad. "I am glad you have come, the foxes almost killed me. I cannot see you now grandson, I am blind." "Don't say that. You will see me again," said Glusko'be. "I will doctor you." Then he cured her. She was so glad when he said, "You will always see me hereafter." Then he went hunting foxes and killed all but one. This one he took to his wigwam and threw him to his grand- mother. "Now take your revenge. I have brought you a fox." Then she gathered switches and lashed him to a pole and whipped the fox. He cried and begged, saying, "Grandmother, I am sorry for abusing you. Never more." Then she stopped and said, "I believe you," and untied him. "Now you will live, but don't ever have contempt for an old woman again." Then Glusko'be said to the fox, "Don't ever go near an inhabited wigwam again." That is why foxes are shy. II. GIUSKI'BE VISITS HIS FATHER Then Gluskc'be said to his grandmother, "I am going away again to stay a while. I must work for our descendants. I am going to visit Winter. He is very cruel. He abuses our descendants too much by his magic power. Where does Summer live?" "In the south," said she, "very well guarded by day and night." "Well, I must go," he said. "Cut me some rawhide strings and roll them into a ball." Then she made seven rolls of rawhide and two pairs of snowshoes. Then Gluska'be departed, saying, "Don't worry, I will soon return." Then his grand- mother said, "Your father has one eye, you will know him when you get there." Then he went. Soon the snow appeared less and less, then bare ground appeared, and he hung his snowshoes on a tree. Then he took out his eye and hid it in a hollow tree and told a chickadee to watch over it for him. Then he walked on. At last he heard dancing and saw a village. He went as a guest to his father's wigwam. "Kwe! father," said he. "Kwe, son," said the father, "I am glad you have come." But his brothers were not glad to see him. Then Gluska'be knew they were seeking his life. One of them began to fill a magic stone pipe. He lighted it and said to Gluska'be, "Now smoke." Gluskcf'be inhaled two long breaths, and emptied the pipe. Then he took another long breath and the pipe exploded. Said he, "Oh, it breaks easily. Let me fill one pipe, brother." So he took his pipe, a small one of ivory, and lighted it and gave it to his brother. "Let us try this." Then his brother smiled with a sneer be- cause the pipe was so small. He thought he would empty it with one breath. Then he began to smoke. He got sick. Then he told the other</page><page sequence="46">46 _yournal of American Folk-Lore. brother to smoke and he got sick and the third the same, until all were sick. Then the father said, "Your younger brother is a great magician. Don't seek his life, for he will overcome you." Despite this, they sought his life because they were jealous. "Let us play the dish game." They brought a dish of stone, a big magic dish. Gluskc'be said, "Let us commence for I am fond of playing." They began. The oldest brother threw, and won many counters. Then Gluska'be threw once and broke the dish to pieces. He gave a great laugh and said, "Oh, it breaks easily. Let us try my dish." Then he produced his dish, a small one of ivory. The oldest brother smiled. Gluska'be threw and won mahy counters. The oldest brother thought, "I will break it when I throw." But he could not lift it, his finger nails only slipped on it. He was beaten. "I am not your equal, brother. You have won." 12. GI4USKC'BE STEALS SUMMER AND OVERCOMES WINTER Then Gluskc'be went on to where they were dancing. He saw the people in groups talking low. He edged up and asked, "What is going on next ?" Then one answered, "Tcastci- !1 the likes of you to know what is going on ?" Gluskc'be said, "You yourself tcastci !" and he twisted his nose off with his fingers. Then he entered where they were dancing about a big bark dish which contained summer like a kind of jelly. Two handsome girls were dancing. Gluska'be spoke to them, but they did not answer. They made fun of him. Because of this he stroked them on the back as they were dancing around. After circling once their looks began to change; before they made another turn they could not dance. The people watching them saw two toads sitting there. They threw them out, because the girls had turned to toads.2 Another still kept on dancing, guarding the summer (jelly) so that no one could touch it. Then Glus- kq'be wished for darkness in the wigwam. Then he grabbed the summer in the dark and started to run away with it. The others dancing heard the summer groaning. Examining it, there were finger marks where it had been picked out. They cried out, "Somebody has snatched away summer. That stranger has done this." Then they went in pursuit of Glus- ka'be. Soon he heard them coming in the shape of big crows. He tied his rawhide ball on his head. Then one of the big crows grabbed him on the head. He grabbed the ball of rawhide and flew back, thinking he had Gluskc'be's head. Then he saw the end of the rawhide as he unrolled it flying along. He started again in pursuit and again grabbed another ball thinking it was the head. Then again only rawhide he held by the end. Then he gave it up. Gluska'be kept on until he saw snow. Soon he 1 An insulting exclamation, accompanied by spreading the knuckles and pointing. 2 Probably accounting for the origin of the Maski'.k'wsu, Toad Woman, creature mentioned before under minor supernatural beings.</page><page sequence="47">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 47 reached the snow. The crows chasing him turned back when they saw the snow. Gluskx'be took his snowshoes from the tree, put them on and looked for his eye. He could not find it. "Where is my eye ?" he asked the chickadee. "A big horned-owl carried it off." Then Glusk('be called the owl and it came flying and he pulled out the owl's eye and put it in his own head. Then he left, going to where it was still colder. Then he came to where the ice house was. He entered and the old ice man said, "Kwe! grandson." Glusk('be mocked him in return. Then Gluskxc'be took the summer and set it down in front of the ice man. He began to sweat at once, saying, "Grandson, I am very hot. You better go away." Gluskoc'be mimicked him, but sat still. Then the old man begged him, "Grandson, go away, you are almost killing me." Glusk('be again mimicked him. Then the ice man's nose melted off, then his legs and finally he melted. Then Glusk('be left and the ice house melted too. 13. GLUSK""BE'S DEPARTURE Then he went home, and his grandmother rejoiced. "Now," said he, "I have fixed it so that never again will there be a winter too hard. I have finished working for our descendants. Now you and I will go away from here to the extreme end of our land (the earth). There we will live forever. Nevertheless we will work for our descendants. I will always hear them whenever they ask help of me. From now on I will continue to work. I will make arrow points. Perhaps in future years a great war will come. Then they can use them, our descendants." Then Woodchuck, his grandmother, said, "Now I also will make stores of baked crushed corn for our descendants' food when the war takes place." 14. GLUSKx'BE DEFEATED BY THE BABY Glusk('be was a very great person. He did many things. He defeated all his opponents. Great dangerous beasts, all great magicians, he defeated. He even defeated the wind. "So," he said, "I--why, there is no one I cannot conquer!" A woman heard him and said, "Don't say that; there is someone who will conquer you." "Who is that.who can conquer me ?" said Gluskoc'be. "Even in my wigwam there is one who will conquer you." Glusk('be said, "I want to see him." "Well, then come to my wigwam." "Yes, I will go to see him." He went to the wigwam. Arriving there he saw a baby in his usual mischief. The woman said, "This baby you are not able to conquer." Gluskg'be laughed loudly. The baby grew angry, he screamed and cried and would not be hushed. The woman said, "Well, Gluskoc'be, try to conquer him." Gluskg'be laughed again. The baby screamed again</page><page sequence="48">48 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. and Glusko'be tried to stop his crying. But he kept on just the same. Then Gluskx'be said, "So, let us both cry." Then he, too, screamed and cried. They were both crying and screaming. At last the baby stopped crying. But he began more mischief; he began spilling water. Gluska'be did the same. They both spilled water all about. Soon the baby got tired spilling water and sat down. Then he defecated; and he turned around and ate it. Now Gluske'be was conquered. Right there he was conquered, - Gluska'be could not do that. 15. GLUSKX'BE CAUSES HIS UNCLE TURTLE TO LOSE HIS MEMBER Once upon a time Gluske'be was walking along in the woods. His mother's brother, Turtle, was with him. They came to a big river where they cooked a meal and ate it. After they had eaten they smoked together. All of a sudden, looking across the river, they saw some women come down to the shore and go in bathing. Turtle desired very much to cohabit with the women. Said he, "Nephew, what shall I do so that I can get near those women? I desire greatly to cohabit." His uncle replied, "Cut off your member. Put it on a stick and send it across; that is what you will do." So thus Turtle found a great long stick, cut off his member and stuck it upon the end of the stick. Then he pushed it across the river underneath the water. When he had sent it half way, in the middle of the river, lo! a trout jumped out of the water and grabbed and swallowed Turtle's member. Ki-i'! he was angry. Turtle was so angry that he cried. Then Glusko'be said, "Don't think anything more of it, for tonight we will recover your member." Then Turtle felt more at ease, and that evening Glusko'be hired a fish hawk to go spearing fish by torch-light. Said he to the fish hawk, "If you encounter a great big-bellied fish, don't spear him in the middle, but hit him on the head." So the fish hawk went spearing for fish. At last he saw the big-bellied fish and speared him on the head. Gi-i'! how Turtle rejoiced. Straight- way he cut open the fish and took out his member. On account of its being in the belly of the fish so long it was all water-soaked and wrinkled. Then Gluska'be said, "Hurry, stick it on, connect it." And Turtle hurried and quickly joined his member. But he put it on his belly bottom side up in his haste so that now Turtle has his member upside ddwn. That is why the Turtle is now called "wrong-side-up member." 16. GLUSKOC'BE AIDS TURTLE TO GET MARRIED After this they started out and went to an Indian village where, as strangers, they entered the chief's house. Auk was the chief. Auk had three daughters. Now Turtle took a liking to one girl, so he said to his nephew, Glusk0'be, "Nephew, I would like that particular girl, the youngest one. So now I want you to propose for me." Glusky'be replied, "All right, I will propose for you." So that night Gluskc'be sent</page><page sequence="49">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 49 the proposal wampum to the chief for Turtle and he was accepted. Right away they got married. Ki-i"! a splendid dance and a great feast were furnished by Turtle. The people ate and played games, running races and jumping. Then Glusky'be said to his uncle, "Now you jump in the contests, too. Jump over your father-in-law's wigwam, Auk's, the chief's house. Jump over it three times. But not more than three times." Ki'i-! when Turtle jumped over the top of Auk's wigwam, all the people were greatly astonished. He beat everyone in jumping. And he got very proud, this Turtle, and said, "Oh, that's nothing." Then he tried to jump again. Now Glusk('be, by thinking, caused him to get caught in the wigwam poles of Auk's house, and there the rascal stuck and soon fell into the fire where he lay on his back. His back was all wrinkled and dried. That's why the turtle's back is so nowadays. Auk, indeed, could hardly snatch his son-in-law from the fire. Turtle knew that his nephew was the cause of his trouble, and so got angry with him for what he did. Turtle was very much ashamed and, besides, very angry, so he made up his mind to kill Gluska'be that evening. That evening he said to his nephew, "Tonight we will lie down together." Accordingly they slept together that night. Now, Gluskq'be knew what Turtle was planning. So after they had lain down Gluska'be, by think- ing, caused Turtle's member to grow very large. So Turtle's member began to grow very large indeed, until at last it got to be as large as his own body, as tall as his head. When he woke up, Turtle thought that the object lying beside him was Glusko'be, sound asleep, so he felt of him and said, "Ki-i"! his heart throbs." He could feel the pulse beating in his member. Then he took his knife and all of a sudden stabbed it. He made an outcry, "Agee ya'd !" He had jabbed his knife through his own member. 17. GLUSK~'BE ALTERS THE ANIMALS' Once Gluskq'be gathered all the different animals about him. He wanted to learn how they would behave toward man. He told them to start and show him what they would do if they should meet a man. All appeared harmless enough just as they were, not strong enough to be dangerous to a man who might be armed. Some of them dug into the ground, others flew about in fear; all behaved according to their ways as we see them now. But then the squirrel, who was at that time as large as a moose is now, rushed up and down trees, dashed across the ground and used his terrible teeth, and Gluske'be saw at once that he was too agile and ferocious. So he took him in his hands and squeezed him down to his present size, and now the squirrel is one of the most harmless creatures.2 1 Told by Buck Andrew, Oldtown, Me. 2 Cognates may be cited from Passamaquoddy, Leland, pp. 18 and 29. 4</page><page sequence="50">5 0 yournal of American Folk-Lore. I8. GLUSKxBIBE MAKES BURNS CURABLE In the beginning fire was unquenchable. Whenever it started to burn it burned forever. And whenever it burned anyone and made a sore the burn would never heal. So the people sent to Gluskq.'be and told him about it. And he changed it so that fire could be put out, quenched by water and other means, and since then it has also been possible to heal burns. 19. GLUSKC'BBE TAMES THE DOG The dog was once a wild animal like the others. Finally he went to Glusk.'be and offered himself to be the companion and helper of man if man would give him a piece of meat every day. Gluskq'be made this agreement with the dog and ever since that time the dog has been a hunting companion of the Indians. 20. SNOWY OWL., GLUSK'/BE, THE GREAT BEASTS, AND THE GREAT WHITE HARE There were two villages of Indians. One was inhabited by people who were quiet, the other by people who were rough and boisterous. The latter persecuted the former. In the quiet village lived a family with one son, named Wa'bi'kok'okha's'u, White Owl, Snowy Owl. This was far in the north where there were many of these owls. Finally the family of Snowy Owl left their village and went among the mountains across the divide to a place that no one knew of where it would be quiet. And at last the father and mother died. But before they died the father told Snowy Owl to send his magic animal helper baohi-'gan, the white owl, to where his grandmother lived and to tell her that he was coming to live with her. He did this and went back - so the grandmother raised the boy. After awhile, fearing that she would die, his grand- mother said to Snowy Owl that she would give him his grandfather's bow and arrows. She took from a birch-bark basket some pieces of ivory and fastened them together into a bow and also some ivory arrow heads. She gave them to him telling him that whatever he shot at he would hit. She told him to talk to the arrows when he used them telling them where to hit and they would do it. It was, indeed, as she said. Whatever he shot at he could not miss. Now he started off to his people's village. When he arrived there and the chief discovered his wonderful power he chose Snowy Owl to be one of his chief hunters. In the course of time it became noticed how the lakes in the region where they lived were getting lower. They feared that the water was going to dry up. So Snowy Owl started off to find out what was the cause of the decrease of water. He traveled far to the south (uncertain as to whether it was south or north) and finally came to a place where</page><page sequence="51">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 5 I he could look from a mountain top over a wide stretch of country. He saw here the signs of some great beasts. And at length he saw objects moving about that resembled small hills of dry grass. He approached them and discovered that they were K'tci'awa-'s, huge beasts with long teeth. They were so big that when they lay down on their sides they could not get up, and as their forelegs were stiff-jointed they slept leaning against the trunks of large trees where they rested at night. He noticed that where they leaned the bark of the trees was worn off. They sometimes spent half a day in drinking water and when they did the water was all taken up. There he found out what was causing the water to disappear from the headwaters of the streams of the country. So Snowy Owl decided to kill them. He went away to a place where a great witch lived with her seven daughters. This family lived by eating people's brains. Whenever they wanted something to eat, the daughters would lure some young men as suitors to marry them and on the marriage night they would tell the husband that it was the custom to have his hair combed. Then they would comb his brains out with a magic comb which he could not feel. When his brains were combed out he would cry "pi'u" !" Then they would eat the brains from the magic comb and would send him forth to travel to the north and live with the Great White Hare. This creature lives on the top of a high peak in the far north, where it is always surrounded by snow. Here no one can reach him because when he sees a person coming he causes it to snow so hard that he becomes overwhelmed. Only those whose brains have been combed out are permitted to reach him. And when they do they are transformed into hares and eat grass. Here they live under the rule of the Great White Hare. So Snowy Owl stayed at the witches' camp to marry the youngest of the daughters who had never yet had a husband. Unlike her evil mother and sisters she loved Snowy Owl and did not wish to have him suffer losing his brains. She planned to escape with him. The mother was a night-witch possessing power only during the night, and harmless as an ordinary person during the day, that is, between sunrise and sunset. The youngest daughter made a magic cap for her mother and one for each of her sisters and said that they were to wear them to dress up in at her wedding celebration. When the mother and sisters put on the magic caps they fell into a deep sleep. Then Snowy Owl and the girl fled from the evil company. All day they ran on. When the old woman awoke she called after them, "You cannot escape me. I will overtake you tonight." They fled on in terror. At last they saw a big wigwam ahead of them. They came up to it and found an old man living there. They spoke to him kindly and he asked them to come in, telling them that he knew beforehand they were coming. This old man was Masa"'ta'we, Great Star, the morning star who among the stars is the last to retire after the night is over. They 4*</page><page sequence="52">52 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. say he sleeps late in the morning, and is mentioned as a warning to lazy persons. Now Snowy Owl and the girl asked him to help them escape from the witch pursuing them. He was kind, and hid them in the back of his wigwam. Then as soon as the sun set the old woman regained her witch power and started in pursuit raging and howling all night after them. She followed their course and reached Morning Star's wigwam just before the break of day. At his door she cried out harshly to be let in, to secure his aid in capturing the girl and Snowy Owl. "Very well," said Morning Star, "my dog and I will help you. But please wait until I can dress myself." He was very slow and took a long time to put on his clothes. Meanwhile the sun was near the rising-point and she cried to him to hurry, saying that at the moment of sunrise she would lose her power and fall asleep until dark again. "Very well," said he, "I am putting on my shirt." "Hurry! hurry!" cried she. "Yes, just a moment, I am putting on my leggings." He was very slow and she had to wait until he had put on his moccasins. At last when he opened the door of his wigwam to let her in - there was the Morning Star before her. Night was over and the sun appeared. The old witch fell powerless and sank into a sleep. Her pursuit was over for the day. Then Snowy Owl and the girl came out and started on again. They continued until they reached the far north where the seven Thunder brothers lived. These brothers cause the thunder and lightning when they open their eyes. When Snowy Owl and the girl reached their wigwam and called to them, one of the Thunders said to another, "Open your eye just a little to see who it is." He opened his eye just a wink to see who was there and lightning flashed around, but not enough to harm the pair. When the Thunders heard their story they took pity on them and asked them in, hiding them safely until the old witch should come up. At last she came, fuming and howling, and commanded them to help her capture her daughter. She cried to be let in the wigwam to see if they were inside. Then the seven brothers all opened their eyes at once. The lightning flashed forth all around and the old witch was shattered to pieces. So Snowy Owl and his girl were now safe. Then they went back to their people. Now Snowy Owl prepared to go and kill the great beasts. He went to the place where they lived and found their "yard" as before. He went to the trees where they leaned to sleep and cut them almost through the trunks so that they would fall over when the beasts leaned against them. When the animals came at night to sleep at their trees these broke off short and the great beasts fell over on them and could not get up again. Then Snowy Owl shot them all with his ivory bow and arrows. There were none left alive. After this the rivers filled the lakes again and the water became plentiful thereafter. There were no more great beasts to drink the country dry. Then Snowy Owl went back to the people. He went also to the village of the rough boisterous people</page><page sequence="53">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 53 and they were all glad to welcome him for what he had done for mankind. And they even made him their chief.' 21. LONG HAIR, A TRANSFORMER2 In a village far up the Penobscot river called azwazogecs'iok, Crooked Wading Channel, lived a chief called Lone Light. He was a great magician and a favorite of his people. He had seven sons; the youngest was a puny child for whom he did not care much. He gave the puny child away to his mother-in-law, Woodchuck. She raised him, calling him Kwunnawus, Long Hair. She taught him to hunt. Later a famine came and the people abandoned Woodchuck and her grandson, Long Hair. So the two began hunting rabbits. Next Long Hair killed partridges. Then his grandmother gave him an ivory bow3 and flint arrows, telling him it was his grandfather's bow. She told him all animals would fall before him. He killed seven deer. Soon Long Hair asked his grandmother if there were not more people in the world. At last she told him that there were but that they had been abandoned by them. Long Hair decided to search for them, in spite of the old woman's warning. At last he started and she gave him a magic belt, which would give him anything he might ask of it. He left her his stone pipe as a means of knowing how he fared. While it remained dry he told her he would be safe, when it contained blood he would be in danger. Should the pipe get full of blood it would mean that he would be dead. 1 The following was added in another version: When the witch's daughter and Snowy Owl were being pursued by the old witch and her remaining daughters Glusko,'be saw them and asked why they fled. Upon being told he said he would fight the witches. He waited for them and when they came up he took them all, each of the daughters and the old woman, turned them upside down and stuck them in the earth head downward like stumps. Then there was great rejoicing, for the terrible witch and her daughters were overcome. Glusko,'be then went to where the Great White Hare dwelt with his victims, the poor men transformed into rabbits after their brains had been combed out. These transformed people were very numerous, living as hares in the land of the Great White Hare. Indeed, nearly all the hares of the world were there by that time. When Gluskc'be approached the Great White Hare the Hare caused it to snow in clouds to confuse him and turn him back. But Gluskq'be did not stop for that. He went up to the Great White Hare, shook him and choked him to death. He said to his victim, "You must not keep all these hares from our descendants. You must free them for our descendants so they will have them to eat." And Gluskq'be then freed the hares and scattered them all over the world for the Indians to hunt and eat. And that is why they are everywhere in abundance now. 2 Freely translated from text. 3 Supposed by narrator to be a double-backed affair known as the war bow.</page><page sequence="54">54 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. Then Long Hair departed in search of his relatives. He travelled seven days and came to a village where an old woman warned him saying that a bad chief sought the lives of all comers. Soon two men came to invite him on a beaver hunt. He accepted. The old woman's husband secretly helped him by sending seven men with them. They reached a lake where a mountain formed the beaver's nest. The hunters ordered a camp on the ice, thinking to freeze Long Hair to death. But he and his seven friends told stories and laughed all night. Long Hair covered them with his magic belt. The other hunters all froze to death. The people in the village were glad to be rid of the bad people. They had a big dance. Again Long Hair started on, and reached another village. An old man and woman told him the people there also sought his life. Soon the people came, inviting him to run the rapids in his canoe. He consulted his belt. Now back at his home camp his grandmother saw blood in the pipe and knew he was in danger. Then suddenly it dried up and she danced and sang for joy. Long Hair ran the rapids safely. He told the bad people it was sport to run them and made them try it and they were all killed. Then the other people were glad. Again he started on and reached another village. They were having a lacrosse game. One half the village was in fear of the other half and they were having this contest. The bad people were playing the good ones. The good ones told Long Hair of their trouble. Soon they invited him to join their sport. He accepted the challenge and selected seven men to help him. He put a spruce tree tip in his shirt bosom. The ball to be used was a skull. As soon as they started to play, the skull at- tacked them. It drove them out on a point of land. Then Long Hair kicked it all to pieces, saying it was too tender to play with. Then he took out the spruce tree tip and used his own ball of ivory. It drove the others into the sea where they became sharks. They begged Long Hair to give them their children's breech cloths.1 But he refused and ordained them to remain as they were. Then all rejoiced that the bad people were gone. Then Long Hair started back to his grandmother. When he arrived he slept seven days. Then he told his grandmother he was going to search for another kind of people. When he found them, he said, they would join them, as he was lonely. She told him to go south to find good people. He started and after seven days came to a wigwam in a village. The people rejoiced to see him, saying that there were bad animals in the neighborhood and asking him to subdue them. Long Hair then put on his magic belt and wished himself back to his grand- mother, as he wanted to join these people. So they joined the new found people. 1 They tried this to regain the power to increase and return to human form.</page><page sequence="55">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 55 Then Long Hair set out to find and kill the bad animals. He called them all to him. He asked them which ones would be willing to stay with people as companions. They went away angry. All but one, the dog, who said he would share the fortunes of men with them. Then Long Hair was pleased and ordained that the others who went away angry would be afraid of him forever. Then he told the other animals to fear the dog, and he stroked the squirrel, which was a large beast, and made him small as he is now. Then he hunted, got meat and distributed it to the people, and they danced. Soon his grandmother died and Long Hair got very lonely. He looked for a woman. He decided to choose be- tween a chief's daughter and a magic woman. The latter wanted him very much, but he preferred the younger, the chief's daughter. Then the sorceress decided to thwart him, or kill both. First she stole his magic belt. Then she asked him to take her over to a big island to pick cran- berries. He agreed and paddled her over. Then she said she wanted to rest as she was tired, so they sat down and she began to stroke his hair. Long Hair fell asleep. The woman then put her moccasin on his head and went away in the canoe. When he woke up Long Hair discovered that he was abandoned. He went down to the beach, and told a little fish to go get the big bonehead shark for him to take him to the shore. The big shark came and said he would take Long Hair ashore but told him to close his eyes and not look, whatever he might hear. Then they started. Long Hair heard the clams singing, "Old ruffled hair is taking a sail, see him! see him!" Long Hair then got ashore and went to his wigwam. Food was ready. He told the magic woman to leave. But before she went she said she would make him regret it. She then told him that the other girl he liked had run off with another man, and she would tell him where they were if he wished. Long Hair was willing, so they went and came to the mountains and she told him that they would go at nightfall to the couple. The magic woman let Long Hair go ahead between the mountains. Then he heard rumbling, and remembered his magic belt, but it was too late, the mountains collided. Then the magic woman went home and made fun of how she had killed Long Hair. The other girl had been waiting for him all the time and she never left home after Long Hair died. Here ends the story. 22. FROTH-OF-THE-WATER This is the story of a young girl, a virtuous girl, who was fond of swimming. Her mother always advised her against being so fond of swimming and said, "Sometime a water nymph will bring evil upon you." She did not obey and was just as fond of swimming. At last after moving around swimming, as she waded ashore, she saw bubbles coming up to the surface of the water. She was surprised; then she stopped and looked. While looking at them, they suddenly commenced to resemble a</page><page sequence="56">56 '7ournal of American Folk-Lore. baby. Then a breeze blew the froth towards her. She was frightened and wanted to get away from it. But it was too late. The froth came into contact with her and then it disappeared after touching her body. She then waded ashore and went home; never again did she swim thereafter. Time went on and all at once her belly commenced to grow. Then her mother said, "What trouble has happened to you?" The girl said, "Nothing ails me, why ?" Her mother told her, "You look surprising. Why does your belly grow? It seems that man has already been near you." The girl said, "Mother, man has never come near me." The mother told the daughter, "You are trying to deceive me but you cannot hide yourself long for soon you will be found out." Then at last her belly was very large and when her father saw her he said, "You are a bad woman. If I did not hold myself in I would strike you dead. You will live alone here whatever may come to you. We are going to leave you because I am disgusted with you and you may die of starvation." Then they moved away and left the young girl. She was unhappy on being left alone. She thought, "What will become of me ultimately? It seems probable that I will die of starvation here." Then she burst out crying. While she was crying a kingfisher came to her suddenly. He said, "Don't grieve. It is impossible to die of starvation here. I will help you and our grandmother will take care of you." The girl was glad and said to Kingfisher, "I will live. Thank you very much. You have pleased me." Then in the evening an old woman came. Moss was her cloak and cedar bark her belt. She said, "Granddaughter, don't let anything worry you. Be contented for I will take care of you." When it was time for her to bear a child, the girl said, "Grandma, I am glad and thank you very much for what you are going to do for me." Chief Big Screech Owl's people moved away and were a long time getting far over the range of mountains. There they came to a village where they settled. The inhabitants of the village were not pleased. They declared war on the strange people and commenced to fight. Then Big Screech Owl knew that the inhabitants were after the lives of his people and so he said to his people, "We must fight if we want to stay here." Then at last a man came to Big Screech Owl and said, "If you are going to stay here you must fight because we do not love you strange people and because our chief, White Bear, is proud. You must conquer us or else you must live here as slaves." Big Screech Owl said, "We are ready to fight whenever you are and we will never go away from here." Then the man left and went to his chief. He said to the chief, "They will not leave and they are ready to fight." The chief said, "Tomorrow we will attack." So next morning they attacked and commenced a battle. Then suddenly White Bear came up. Big Screech Owl's men looked and saw him. Then they commenced to run they were so frightened. Then Big Screech Owl became discouraged, when he saw the beast coming up; he was so big that he was half way up the trees</page><page sequence="57">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 57 in height. Big Screech Owl hollered to White Bear and said, "You have conquered us. Stop your men. I give up now and we will become your slaves." White Bear said, "That's good." Then he stopped his men and said, "Let them alone. They have become our slaves." The girl, Big Screech Owl's daughter, had delivered her baby which was a boy. Maski-'kWsi- said, "The little man has now been seen. What will you name him ?" The girl said, "Bubble Froth, because he was conceived in water." Maski-'kwsi- said, "A good name. He will become the greatest magician this side of the divide-mountain." The girl rejoiced. Maski-'kwsi- took good care of both the mother and the son and the kingfisher brought them all kinds of fish and fed them well. The boy grew fast and was healthy. When he had grown enough Maski-'- kWsi- taught him to hunt and made him a bow and took him rabbit hunting in the woods. Then the boy hunted alone and brought wild meat to his mother and his grandmother. Then when he became a man, the kingfisher who was his great true real friend told him, "You ought to search for your grandfather and your grandmother and your other people." When he came back to the wigwam he said to his mother and to Maski.'kwsi", "Kingfisher told me I have many relatives. Now then I am going to search for them." He said to Maski-'kwsi-, "Which way are my people ?" Maski-'kwsi? said, "Very far away but you will certainly come to where they are." She said, "You go in a northerly direction. At length you will see a range of hazy mountains and across them are your people." Froth went away and he walked many a long day's journey. At last looking way off he saw a range of misty mountains. He rejoiced and said, "Soon I will come to where my people are." He hurried along and when he came to the other side of the mountains he saw a village. He said, "Soon I will see my people." Looking he saw that half of the village was quiet while the other half was noisy and many were there playing ball together. Others were dancing in the wigwams. He entered from the quiet direction. Here he saw Woodchuck. When she saw him she began to cry and at the same time to talk. She said, "Poor grandson, we suffer very much because we are slaves." Then she commenced to relate to Froth her life history. She said, "You, you with the slave sort." Then she stopped grieving and prepared food and cooked. She gave him food and Froth ate. While eating a man rushed in quickly and said, "A little beast has been tracked in the bush. We will have sport. It is said they pursued him." Woodchuck said, "At least you ought to wait till the man is done eating." Then Froth said, "Soon I will be ready. I, too, am very fond of sport." Then he finished eating and took his bow. He told Woodchuck, "Don't worry about me, grandmother." Then he went out. Outside men were standing waiting for him. They said to Froth, "Here in the thicket are fresh tracks of the animal. Let us chase him." So they all went forth. Froth began tracking and he saw that the tracks</page><page sequence="58">58 Journal of American Folk-Lore. were so big that they looked as though a wigwam had been pulled from the ground. Froth began to run and chased the little animal. The people all hung back and let Froth go ahead. They were laughing at Froth in their minds. Froth overtook the little beast and said, "Oh my!" for there standing halfway up the trees in height was White Bear. Then Froth shot at White Bear but White Bear did not feel or notice it. Then he shot again and then he had used up all his arrows except one. Suddenly a flying chickadee appeared. It lit on Froth's shoulder and commenced making a noise, slyly whispering, "Heel." Froth looked and saw something throbbing at White Bear's heel. He shot at the throbbing round thing. Then White Bear toppled over. Froth went to White Bear and when he got there, White Bear was dead. Froth had shot him in his heart and the arrow had gone clear through White Bear's heart. Then the people came up in a mass and some of them were laughing. When they got there they looked and saw White Bear lying dead. Froth said, "I will give you your share of the beast. It was very good sport." The people cast their eyes down quickly. Nobody spoke. Then they walked back to the village. Then Froth walked to the village. When he saw Woodchuck, he said, "I have shot him, that White Bear." Then Woodchuck cried because she felt so glad. And she said, "Grand- son, you have done a very great thing. You have conquered the greatest magician in the world." Froth said, "By the help of Kingfisher and Chickadee." That evening there was big rejoicing and a big dance and every one was happy. Next morning Froth left for his mother's. At last he arrived and said to his mother, "Get ready for tomorrow we move. I have found our people." The next morning they started off. Along came Kingfisher and Chickadee and Maski-'kwsi to bid them goodbye. Kingfisher said, "Greetings, Froth. Now in the future if you ever meet with great danger, think of me and I will help you." And Maski.'kwsi also said, "And I too, Froth, grandson. When you meet with difficulty think of or wish for me." And Chickadee said, "And think of me and I will help you." Then the mother and Froth went on. At last they reached the village. Then they went to Woodchuck's. Then Woodchuck cried, she was so glad. Soon all Froth's relations came up. His grand- father said to him, "The reason we came is that we wish you to forgive us for leaving you so poor and miserable. You saved us a lot by con- quering the greatest magician man. Now then you will be a great chief and I now take off my office mantle and put it on you." Then he took off his chieftainship and put it on his grandson. Then Froth was a great, great chief. 23. FOND-OF-TRAVELLING, SEVENTH-SON, AND THE LAND OF SPIRITS CLAD IN WHITE Once upon a time a young man was tracking a moose. While he was going along he suddenly heard some one saying, "Fond-of-Travelling,</page><page sequence="59">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 59 let that animal alone. There is better work that I wish you ultimately to do." Then Fond-of-Travelling was astonished. He said to him, "What is it that I must do ?" thinking, "I must listen to all it instructs me." It said to him, "Right now go in the direction of the north. Don't stop anywhere until it comes night because you have a long way to go." Then he turned and left as he was told in the direction of the north. He went along very fast. At last when it was dark he saw a village. Then he went into the first wigwam and spoke in a loud voice, "Kwe, kwe." After a while he heard a man saying, "Come in! my young friend." Then he went into the wigwam and the old man said, "My young friend, I am glad to see you." Then he laid down a wolf skin which he laid out on the bed and said, "Sit down. You must be tired for you have come very far. This is Big Chief Seventh's village. He is very old and wise and he rules his people with great kindness. Because of that they love him. We will go and see him tomorrow because now you are tired and hungry. Soon we will have dinner." He said to his wife, "Hurry with your cooking." Accordingly the old woman cooked hur- riedly and prepared supper. "Let us eat," he said, and then they fell to and ate ravenously. After eating he entertained Fond-of-Travelling. Then it grew quite late and they went to sleep. Next morning two men came up and said, "Fast Walker, our chief wants to see you and he wishes you to have breakfast with him." Accordingly Fond-of-Travelling went to the chief's and when he entered the chief said, "My good youth, I am glad to see you." Looking around, Fond-of-Travelling saw lots of tanned hides and wampum; the chief's wigwam was finely furnished. The chief spread a white bear skin on the bed and said, "Sit down, my good youth. You have come very far. We will wait till after we eat and then we will talk." Then they ate. When they had finished the chief said, "My good youth, I know all your ancestors and they were all great fast walkers. That's why I called you to come. I want you to do me a favor. I wish now to look around for a big camp ground. I want to move away from here because already my people are tired of it. We have had our village here for a long while and already my hunters have depleted the game and now they have to go a long way to hunt. I wish you would go and find a good camp ground, some place where there is an abundance of game and where there are plenty of nice lakes. You will come back here again when you have seen another new moon." Fast Walker said, "Chief, I am glad to work for you and I will do what you order me and will come back when the new moon next appears." Fast Walker bade goodbye to the chief and then he went away. He went along until dark and then he made a shelter lodge of boughs. There he stayed over night and again the next morning he went away. Again it was night and again he stayed over night. Then he came to a big river and he started to follow it up. At last he saw a lake. He travelled and came to the head of the lake. Looking he saw another lake, a very</page><page sequence="60">60 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. nice looking lake and he also saw many beasts. He said, "I have found a fine camp ground." Then he travelled until almost night and looking ahead of where he was going he saw an opening of a fine appearance. Then he went to investigate it. When he got there he looked and saw a bog floating. He was astonished. He could nowhere see land and he was astonished. Then he went out into it and while standing there all of a sudden a terrible wind came. Then he felt himself carried along by the wind and he was terribly frightened and thought, "Apparently the time has come that I die, for if the wind stops, I shall fall and then I will perish." But the wind still blew on all the night and in the morning he looked and saw land. Then the wind blew him up to the land and then it calmed down and he gradually fell. He saw it looked fine along the place where he was facing. He sat down and was discouraged. He thought, "What ever shall I do so that I can get back where I came from ? I have been blown very far across this floating bog." While sitting there thinking he looked suddenly and saw a marked tree. He went and saw a blazed trail. Then he followed it and came out into a big path. Then he followed it. At last he saw a hill before him and a village surrounded by high walls. He saw houses, some of them rising above the stockade. Going ahead he saw the door gate and sitting down on each side of the gate were great magic dogs. Then they barked loudly and came running to meet him. He was frightened and feared them; they were very fierce- looking and as large as moose. He thought, "I will be eaten up by the dogs." Then the dogs came running up. They were glad. They were pleased. Then they went up to the gate, one on each side of him. The gate opened slowly. A big man came out. He was red in the face and dressed in white. He said, "You have come and I am very glad to see you. I rejoice. Our great commander has expected you for a long while. Soon we will go. First we will go to my wigwam. You must be very hungry for you have come very far." Then they went to the wigwam of this man. It was beautiful-looking and all hung full of wampum and tanned hides of different kinds. Then they ate and after they had eaten the man said, "Let's go and see the great com- mander." Then they went and when they came there, they saw a great big magic-looking wigwam. They entered; it was full of people and they all stood up. At the far end was a high seat and there sat the great commander. Then he stood up and beckoned to Fast Runner and said, "I am glad to see you. I have been expecting you for a long while." Then they sat down. "Now we will show you how glad we are that you came." Then they sang a rejoicing song. All the people sang and they were all happy and very surprised. When they got through singing the commander said, "You have heard my people sing their feelings. They showed you how much they rejoiced." Then he said to Fast Runner, "Today you must rest yourself for you have come very far. Tomorrow we will talk." Then the next morning they talked. The commander</page><page sequence="61">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 6 i said to him, "Now they will show you around to see what we have done since we came here." Then two young men came and they all went out to look over what they had done with the land. Immense corn fields had been cleared. Fast Runner was astonished. Then he looked and saw many wigwams, set out as far as one could see. Then they went back to the commander. He said, "You have seen how much we have done. Now I shall tell you. For a long while I was moving around and all at once while I was moving in the woods I heard a voice in the tops of the trees. It said, 'Grandson, now you move your people. I have selected ground far away to the north and there you make your village. Clear away the trees and cultivate the ground and build wig- wams. I am ever going to keep my people happy. When you have finished your village, I will send a young man so that you can tell him what to do.' " Fast Runner said, "I will do what you order me." Then the commander went to his wigwam and said to his people, "We will move far away northward. Great Being ordered me to build a village there. Our red people will stay there forever." So they commenced to go and moved away. They wandered till winter when the bog became frozen. Then they moved across northward very far away. At last they arrived and they were pleased and then they commenced to work. The commander said, "Right in the middle of this island we will build a town." He told Fast Runner, "Here now, right in the middle of the island a wigwam stands. Northward, one new moon distance, is the bog and south, one new moon, is a bog and the sun rises in the east and sets in the west." He said, "Here the island will be always and here our people will live forever." He said to Fast Runner, "You go back and tell our people what you have seen, where we live and we will move in immediate- ly. Our wigwams are all built now. Again when the big bog freezes, we will commence to move. Whoever does not listen to you, him you will curse with the hounds and you will see how he becomes. You tell our people that the big bog freezes up every ten years. Then they can come across it quickly. Now as you go tell it first to Seventh and commencing from him you tell it to others as far as they are." So Fast Runner said, "I will do what you order me. I want to know how I can cross the big bog." The commander then said, "Do not bother to think. I will see to it that you can cross." Then he said to Fast Runner, "Tomorrow you go; I will give you clothing, then you will cross." He said to Fast Runner, "Until then let us go to the wigwam where the clothing is." Then they went and got a supply of clothing, all white very fine rabbit hair clothing. Then he gave him a suit. He said, "This will keep you warm." Then he said, "Now you come home the second time it is frozen over. By that time you will have seen all our people." Fast Runner said, "I will obey you." Then next morning he got ready and the com- mander came and said, "Let us go." Then they went to the bog and when they got there he said, "Close your eyes. Don't be afraid." While he</page><page sequence="62">62 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. was standing there a great wind came up. Then Fast Runner rose high and was again blown back to where he came from. Then he went to Seventh's village and the chief was glad and said to Fast Runner, "Did you find a camping ground?" Then Fast Runner said, "Yes, I found a good camping ground but I found another still better. Now I will tell you what I have seen." He then said, "I found that our com- mander has built a great village where all our people will live together and be happy forever. Our commander ordered me to tell all our people as far as they inhabit everything, to finish only what is necessary, and then move. Now you will move to where I found camp ground. You will camp there until the bog freezes. Then you will move northward and you will find our future village." Seventh said, "I am glad. You have brought good news." Then he, Fast Runner, went searching other people and when he came to any village he would tell what he had seen. Some of them were glad. Others did not believe it. At last he suddenly came to a big village. Then he went to the great chief's and told him what he had seen and what he had been ordered to do by the com- mander. Then the chief said, "Where is the commander ? I do not know him." Then he gave a great laugh and said to the good youth, "I will not go away from here. Here I will die." Then Fast Runner said, "Good." Fast Runner got up and stood looking at the chief. After a while the chief was transformed and he turned into a rat. Fast Runner said, "Here evidently you will die." Then he went to another village. When he got there he went to the chief and told him what he had seen. The chief said, "I am glad for what you tell me. My people obey me and we will go there but perhaps all my people will not obey me. Then who do not obey me will stay here if they wish. Now you go about the village and you tell what you have seen. If they do not believe it, I can not help it." Fast Runner said, "Good. I will go about the village and I will tell what I have seen and then if they do not believe me you will see what they come to." Then he went about and told the people. They laughed at him and said, "You astonish us. Man, you don't know what you are talking about. We have been here a very long while and it is better that we die here than haul our sleds to the big bog you tell about." Fast Runner said, "Good." He smoothed their heads and they all turned into rats. Then he said, "You will never haul your sleds to the bog." There Kiwa"'kwe was going along when he bumped against a tree and that's the end of him. 24. FAST RUNNER Here camps my story. After his marriage he moved into the woods to hunt. He returned in the spring but his wife did not because she was dead and gone. So he lived a widower. The women feared him. When he proposed he was refused. At last he proposed to a young</page><page sequence="63">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 63 woman who had seven brothers. Then the father of the girl finally laid it before his sons and they all wanted to refuse it. But one, the youngest, accepted him. He said, "Don't be afraid of him. Perhaps he is a magician but other men have magic power, I too. I also love our young sister. He can not harm anything. I think I have in mind a little power of magic." That's why they accepted him. "You also all have some magic power. Why do you fear him ?" Then the old man said, "My young son is right." He said to the suitor, "You are accepted." Then they married. After the wedding the groom came and said, "It is time already to move into the woods. I know where there are beavers. We will move there because lots of other animals are abundant. Right now we prepare to go." Accordingly the, old man said, "All right, we will get ready right away and will be ready when you are." When the groom was ready they started for their territory. When they arrived there he did not hunt at all. He only wanted to try magic with his brothers-in-law. He brought a bone and said, "Let us have fun. Play who can break it." Then he gave it to the oldest of his brothers-in-law who took it and tried hard to break it. But he could not break it. Then he gave it to the next oldest brother and he could not break it. At last all six men could not break it. Then he gave it to the youngest brother and as he took it he immediately broke it. Then the groom scowled when he saw his brother-in-law had such magic power. He thought, "I will conquer you." Then he walked out to his wigwam and spoke in thought. He looked very sour. Then again he went to his father-in-law. He said to his brothers-in- law, "Tomorrow we will go to kill a little beaver right near here. He is there." They told him, "All right, we will go kill the young beaver in the morning." They heard him holler, "All right, it is time. Let us all go." They said to their brother-in-law, "All right, we are going." He (the groom) went on ahead. Then he began to run. They followed him. After a while they could not see him. So the young son ran fast in the rear. Then he overtook his brothers and said, "Where's our brother-in- law?" They said, "We don't know. He has out-run all of us. The young brother laughed and said, "I soon will overtake him." Then he ran. Then he saw him going by. Then he saw a lake and ran fast and he overtook him before he reached the shore of the lake. With great laughter the groom said, "Where are the other brothers?" The young son said, "Near here. Very soon they will come. We will await them." After a little while they all came up. The groom said, "Now you make a hole in the ice. I will go and drive him out." He said, "He lives there in the mountain." Then he started to drive the beaver out. He cut a passage for him, then he cut a hole in the ice where the beaver would come out. Then he waited for him to show his head. Then the oldest brother took his spear, as he was the first to wait for the beaver to come out. Suddenly he heard a roaring. They said, "Already they are coming and making a roar under the ice." Then the groom said to the young</page><page sequence="64">64 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. son, "Now be careful and hit the beaver well." Soon after that the beaver showed his head. The big beaver looked terrible. He struck at the beaver hard and struggled with all his might. He could not hold the beaver and he could not let go his spear. Then at last the beaver almost drew him under the ice. Then the young son grabbed his spear away from him and said, "What ails you ? Let me try." Then the beaver went under water and the young son said, "Another will soon come." Then again another waited over the hole. Sure enough after awhile a beaver came approaching under the ice and again he speared him when he poked his head up. The whole group of men could not conquer him. Only the young son waited for him. At last the beaver again rose, even more fierce and larger than before. The young son speared him. Then he commenced to struggle. He could not throw the beaver out of the water on the ice and so he knocked him on the head and killed him. Then he kicked the ice into the hole with his feet and said, "Seven years and then again it will open up." Then came Fast Runner and said, "Now, brother-in-law, I will give you my game, the little beaver."' Fast Runner looked cross and did not speak. Then he left and the rest went away with him to their home. From then on they commenced to hunt. They got lots of moose but Fast Runner always looked ugly and cross. He did not speak to his brother-in-law. At last whoever went roaming in the woods never came back again. Then another would go searching and he would never come back and so went all the family of boys.2 Then the old man searched for them and he never came back. Then the old lady and Fast Runner's wife searched for him. Her daughter and she trailed them. Then at last great magic Big Bear came. He tackled the old lady and struck her dead with his paw. Then he started to tear her up. Suddenly he stopped and walked off. Then when Fast Runner's wife saw her mother lying there dead she cried and said to Bear, "Me too, kill me. You have already killed my relatives." Bear kept on walking. Then she looked at her mother and saw a baby struggling where the bear had wounded her belly. She went to where her mother was lying. Then she took up the baby. She wrapped him up and walked off. When it was almost night she built a shelter of fir boughs. They stayed there over night. Next morning they built a good camp, and there they lived. She took care of her young brother and at last when the boy reached young manhood he was always a hunting man and they made a good living for he got lots of game of all kinds. Then suddenly they got tired of the place and the young woman said, "It is enough. Let us move. Already I am tired of it here." Then Little Bear said, "I also am tired already. To- 1 This was said as a slur upon his brother-in-law. Here the proper name of the hero, Kesi-'tat, Fast Runner, is used for the first time. 2 Ordinarily, the narrator says, he would repeat the phrase for each of the brothers, but this shortens the narrative by treating them collectively.</page><page sequence="65">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 65 morrow I will search for another camp ground." The next morning they left and went searching. Suddenly while he was going he saw a wigwam. When he came in its doorway he said, "Who lives here ?" A young woman came out and said, "I and my sister live here." She said, "Come in. I am glad to see you. Where do you live ?" Little Bear said, "Over there among the hills where the sun rises. My sister and I live together. We have tired of our camp ground. We want to move. That's why I came by here. I am looking for a camp ground." The girl said, "You ought to move here. My sister and I would be very glad." Bear went back to his wigwam. He arrived at night and said to his sister, "I found a camp ground and tomorrow we will move there. Two women live there and you will not be lonesome." Next morning they moved and when the sister saw the other girls she was very glad. The other girls said to them, "Don't build a camp. We will all live together because we are very glad to see you." So they lived together. Little Bear always went hunting. One day he met a man who was manly, good looking, and finely clothed. All his clothes were made of wampum. He said to him, "Let us wrestle. Now if you throw me then we will swap clothes." Little Bear said, "Let's wrestle." Then Little Bear threw him and won his clothes. That evening when Little Bear came home his sister said to him, "Where did you get your clothes? They are such nice ones." Little Bear said, "I won them. I wrestled with a man I met who wanted to wrestle. He said to me, 'If you throw me we will swap clothes.' Then I threw him and won his clothes." The other girls dropped their heads and did not speak. He was surprised. Next morning he again met another one dressed in dark wampum material who wanted to wrestle. Then again Little Bear threw him and won his clothes. When he came home the women did not speak to him. Also his sister did not speak to him. He was surprised at them and the way they acted. He thought, "Tomorrow I will leave." Then the next morning he went from them. He went and while going along he heard lots of laughing women. When he arrived there they were swinging and they were merry. When they saw him they all clustered around him and invited him to swing. Accordingly he got into the swing and the girls swung him. At last when he swung high the girls cut the swing and he fell down. He looked quickly while falling and saw water boiling in a hollow rock. Then he turned the string of his bow forward and when he struck the rock he bounced away because of that. He struck the other side of the rock and stood there. He heard talking in the wigwam. Some one said, "Thank you. Our daughters were lucky to get food." Then an old woman came out with a wooden spoon which she held in her hand. Then she felt in the water for the body but found nothing in the water. She said, "They have lied to us." Then she went away and Little Bear went to where the daughters were swinging and said,"It is very great fun to swing. Now you get in and I will swing you." Accord- 5</page><page sequence="66">66 7yournal of American Folk-Lore. ingly they had to get in. Then he swung them. Then when they swung high he at the same time cut them loose and they fell in the boiling water. The old woman said, "Thanks." Then again she came out with her spoon and felt for something in the water. "What a benefit I get from my daughters," she said. Then she dipped up her daughter and burst out crying. The old lady said, "We are conquered. Now we will die of starvation." Then Little Bear went away from the swing. Then he went in the direction of the south for seven days and then came to a village. He married and stayed there. Then I went away. 25. THE ABANDONED BOY ESCAPES FROM THE CANNIBAL SORCERESS A long while ago there lived a creature named Ki-wa"kwe'skwe,' "woman wandering in the woods." She was a cannibal. A boy lived with her whom she called her younger brother. Now she always kept her back turned toward him never letting him behold her face. When she handed him anything she passed it to him behind her back. She continually fed him up in order to fatten him and she taught him to hunt rabbits. At last one time a rabbit appeared and spoke to him, saying, "You have already killed a great many of us. That is enough; don't hunt us too persistently or you will exterminate us. Henceforth do not obey that woman who is ordering you. She is not your sister. On the con- trary she is a bad magician who is only lying to you and just fattening you up until you are prime, when she will kill and eat you. For her food is human beings. Already she is obliged to wander far in search of her prey. Now you must escape her. I will help you so that you will find your own people. I know where they are and I will guide you part way after which there will be others to guide you onwards to where your folks are living." So spoke the rabbit. Then he added, "Now this night do not sleep, only pretend. Watch what she does. If she speaks to you do not answer. If you do this you will then see how she really looks." That night the boy found that his supposed sister had cooked a good meal for him and he ate a great deal. Then he lay down and pretended to fall asleep. He took an awl to bed with him and slyly bored a little hole through his covering so that he could watch his sister through it in order to see her face. After awhile the sorceress took her fire poker and stirred the firebrands so that they fell outwards sputtering. At the same moment she cried, "Tce! brother, a firebrand has fallen on you!" This was to test his sleep. But the boy did not move. Slyly he watched his sister. Then he saw her take out of her pack a big bark basket, and thinking the boy was asleep she talked to herself, "Already I am nearly out of food." And turning toward her brother she mur- 1 The feminine form of ki-wa"'kwe, the cannibal monster of the region, corresponding to the concept of wi'-'tigo north of the St. Lawrence, and windigo of the Ojibwa.</page><page sequence="67">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 67 mured, "I guess my boy is now almost fat enough." When he actually saw how she looked the poor boy was frightened almost to death. For already she had eaten off both her lips as far as she could reach with her teeth. The next morning he said to his sister, "Make me my moccasins, make two pairs; because I want to go very far away hunting, as I have almost exterminated the rabbits around here already. I will try this time to hunt big game, deer and bears." Then indeed, very quickly she finished two pairs of moccasins. Then he said to his sister again, "In four days I will return." Then he went away and before long met his friend the rabbit. The rabbit said, "Now, we must hurry." So they commenced to run with all their might. Soon it grew dark and still they kept running. At the break of morning the rabbit said, "Now this is as far as I can go. It is only a short way to the river where you will cross. Our grandfather Heron is there. He will set you across. He will point out the direction." Then the rabbit turned back and left the boy to go on alone. Soon he could hear the evil spirit woman, his sister, laughing in pursuit. He heard her say to herself, "My poor younger brother, you want to escape, but the world isn't big enough for you to escape me. Soon I will overtake you and then you will die." Then the boy became frightened when he heard his sister talking and he ran yet harder. At last he got down to the river, where, looking across, he saw Heron. Then he called to him, "Grandfather, set me across. An evil spirit woman is pursuing me." Then Heron began singing, "Very pretty legs has Heron." "Yes, indeed, you have fine legs, grandfather," exclaimed the boy. "Very graceful neck has Heron." "Yes, indeed, your neck is graceful, grandfather." Then Heron put his leg across the river and said to the boy, "Grandson, here your path is very straight. You go on and I will hinder the evil spirit woman a while. Soon you will come to grandfather Porcupine and he will help you and show you the way you are to go." So the boy crossed and hurried on his. way. Soon the evil spirit woman reached the bank of the river and saw Heron sitting on the other side. Said she to Heron, "Put me across and hurry." "Very pretty legs has Heron," sang Heron as before. When he had finished his song the evil spirit woman said, "Big excrement-daubed legs. Hurry up and set me across." Then again Heron sang as before, "Very graceful neck has Heron." "That's the shape of your neck," replied the evil spirit woman, breaking a stick to imitate his bent neck. "Old homely neck, hurry up and set me across and stop your singing." Then Heron reached his leg across the river and she started to cross over. When she reached the middle, 5*</page><page sequence="68">68 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. Heron turned his leg and she fell, this spirit woman, into the rapids and drifted down through the rapids where nobody could live. As for the boy he kept going and at last came to a high ledge where Porcupine lived. Said the boy, "Grandpa, open the way for me; an evil spirit woman is after me." Then Porcupine commenced singing; way beneath his ledge the boy could hear him singing, "In a very fine ledge is my home." Then said the boy, "Surely it is a fine ledge, grandpa." Soon Porcupine opened the door and the boy entered to where the great magic giant, Porcupine, lay. Said he, "Grandchild, don't be scared. I will stop this evil spirit woman until you reach the home of your other grandfather." As for the evil spirit woman stranded on the bank of the river after being dead in the rapids for a while, she woke up and found her mouth all full of maggots and she spit them all around, and said, "Why, indeed, I fell asleep." She spoke again and said, "You think you can escape me; but I will surely catch you." Then she started on after the boy and came to where Porcupine lived, and she shouted to Porcupine and said, "Open the door." And Porcupine began singing to her, "In a very fine ledge is my home." Then she shouted to him, "All daubed with excre- ment are the crevices of your house." Now Porcupine said to the boy, "You go out of the way now and lie down." He went back and lay down. Then Porcupine opened the door and the evil spirit woman entered. All at once Porcupine shook himself and pierced the woman through and through with his quills. And there again she died. "Now," said Porcupine to the boy, "a little way from here lives your grandfather." So the boy started again and at last came to the edge of an open clearing, where he saw a wigwam. He went to where it was and beheld an old man all alone. "Kwe, grandpa, I come," said he. The old man just looked at him. Then the old man said to his dog, "Bad dog, I give him to you to eat." Then the boy became frightened when he heard the dog rise and shake himself with a great rumbling. When the dog came out to eat the stranger, behold! he was a monster bigger than a caribou. As soon as he saw the boy he acted very glad and he whined with joy. And the old man wondered at his behaviour and said to the boy, "Where are you from, grandson ?" Then the boy said, "I am pursued by an evil spirit woman who wants to kill me." Then the old man jumped up and said, "Grandson, at last you have come back, that evil spirit woman, as it happened, stole you when you were small. She took you away from me while I was alone. I rejoice that you are still alive and that I can see you again. Your mother and father are yet alive and, moreover, that is your dog, Bad Dog. And, moreover, your bird is yet alive. Forthwith, tomorrow, you will again hear him.</page><page sequence="69">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 69 White wampum he will cause to rain by his voice, and the next day dark wampum he will cause to fall." All of a sudden the evil spirit woman appeared in the edge of the clearing and the old man said, "Grandson, I will meet her and we will fight. You leave us alone." And the old man met her and they clinched and fought. At last the boy saw that his grandfather was getting beaten. Then he said to his dog, "Bad Dog, I give her to you." Then the dog rushed at her, this evil spirit woman, and very quickly he tore her all to pieces. Then, indeed, that was the end of this evil spirit woman. The next morning the magic bird made an outcry and soon white wampum came rattling down. Again on the next morning he caused dark wampum to come rattling down. Then the old man said, "Now you must take good care of your bird, lest it be stolen." Sure enough, the next morning a strange man came and packed up the bird upon his shoulder like a pack, and as soon as he had gone the old man said to his grandson, "Now hasten, be quick. That man is very swift." Then the boy rose and followed him to where there was an open place where he could see the man but the man could not see him. At last he could almost see the man's wigwam. And he tried running with all his might to overtake him before he reached the wigwam. When he came up with the man he seized his bird and brought it back to his own wigwam and hung it up. "Now," said the old man to his grandson, "another man will surely come and take away your bird. You must be close behind and have very strong magic." Sure enough, the next morning another man came and took the bird on his back and when he jumped up to go, the boy jumped up and ran after him with all his might. He ran so fast that no one could see him. Hurrying as fast as he could, at last he saw him going and soon overtook him too. When he was very close to the man's wigwam, the boy snatched the bird again. "Now," said the old man to his grandson, "you have, indeed, done very well. You are a great magician. But there is another woman still more powerful than even that magic woman. If you take her you will be able to save your bird." Sure enough the next morning the woman came in and soon she, too, put the bird on her shoulders and jumped up. And the boy, run- ning, chased her to an open place where he could hardly see her. At last he saw a wing lying on the ground and after a while saw another wing lying on the ground, and soon he saw a camp, but nowhere beheld the woman. Then he beheld a bundle. It was his bird with its head cut off. He had lost his bird and he grieved very deeply. The old man said to his grandson, "You can't help it; that woman was a greater magician than you; she was a very strong magician. Now, we</page><page sequence="70">70 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. will move from here to where your father and mother are." So the next morning they moved. For seven days they traveled to reach the village. When they arrived they told how they had overcome the evil spirit woman, and when the people saw that the boy who had been stolen was still alive, lo, there was great rejoicing and feasting. 26. WHITE WEASEL AND WOLVERINE Wolverine and his wife were always about. Once he heard a dog barking and howling. He was very much surprised. He stopped and listened to find out what direction the howling came from and then he started to look for the dog. At last he came to an opening in the woods which was an abandoned camp ground. Then the dog howled again. He saw a little wigwam set at the far end of the opening. He went there and the dog came out. The dog was so glad that he whined. Wolverine went in to the little wigwam and saw a little baby lashed in a cradle board. The baby's face was scabby and poor. He had been abandoned. Wolverine pitied the child. Then he took the child and the dog was glad. Wolverine took the baby away. He said, "I will carry him to my old woman for my young man." He went to his wigwam and the dog followed. When he got to his wigwam, he said to his old woman,"I bring you your young man. Here is a very pitiful child that was abandoned to die in an old abandoned house. If I had not heard the dog howling he would surely have starved to death, poor child." The old woman was glad. She said, "I will doctor him and soon I will cure him." That night Wolverine said, "Tomorrow you go out and we will name him after the first big animal or little animal that you see." Accordingly, the next morning she went out. She looked and saw a white weasel. Then they named him White Weasel. She doctored him and at last she cured him. He was very nice looking. He grew up fast. Right away he was fond of hunting rabbits and partridges and at last he brought in deer, bears, and moose. At last he became a man. Right away he had magic. At last he asked Wolverine, "Are there any other Indians?" Wolverine said, "Yes, they exist but they are far across the other ocean." White Weasel asked, "What direction is that other ocean ?" Wolverine said, "Let us go out." So then they went out and Wolverine said, "That direction in the north," and pointed. Then White Weasel said, "I am glad to know it. Sometime I am going to visit them." Wolverine said, "I am going to tell you how those people used you. Where I found you was where they evidently left you. It will be impossible for you to find your parents for you would not know them but your dog would surely know them, When you go let your dog guide you. Your dog saved your life after your parents had left you to starve to death and you might have starved only that the dog was more knowing than your parents." Said White Weasel, "Tomorrow I will get ready to visit my</page><page sequence="71">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 7 parents. I am going to see how people look that do not even know as much as a dog." In the evening he told his grandmother, Wolverine's woman, "Grandma, get me six pairs of snowshoes. I want to visit the other ocean. Don't be sad because I will come back again and will never leave you." Then he and his dog started. He said to his dog, "You go ahead." He followed. After going along a few days he met a very small man. The man said, "Kwe, White Weasel." He answered, "Kwe!" Then he said to White Weasel, "Where are you going?" White Weasel said, "Across the ocean to see my people." Then Mikamwessu said, "It is very far and very dangerous but I will help you. We will go together." White Weasel said, "I am glad!" Then they started. At last it grew dark. Next morning they started on. Suddenly Mikocmwessu said, "Let us stop here for a while until I pick some spruce gum." So they stopped and Mikomwessu picked spruce gum. When he got enough he melted the gum down. When he had melted it he made four balls from the gum. Then he gave White Weasel two and said, "We will plug up our ears with these soon because we will encounter Kiwakwe." Then he said to White Weasel, "Now plug up your ears. Put the gum in your ears." So he put it in his ears and Mikamwessu also plugged his. Then again they started. At last suddenly Mikamwessu said, "Just look ahead." Then White Weasel looked ahead and all the trees were shaking. When they came close they saw Kiwakwe's fighting there. They were pulling up trees to hit each other with. They looked fierce and they reached to the tree tops they were so tall. Both kept their mouths wide open while they fought. At last one was killed. As he fell the other went up to him, cut his windpipe and sucked the blood. White Weasel and Mikocmwessu looked at him for a long time. At last he had eaten enough and then they started along. After a long time Mikocmwessu took the balls of gum out of his ears. Then White Weasel also took the balls out of his ears. Mikamwessu said, "You saw the Kiwakwe's open their mouths but you did not hear the noise they made. If we had not plugged up our ears we would have died with the noise." Then they went along for a few days. At last Mikamwessu said, "We are almost at the head of the ocean." That evening he said, "Tomorrow when we start send your dog ahead so that he can fix our travelling to the village." So the next morning they started. White Weasel said to his dog, "Now you fix our path wherever there is danger. You will know what to do. Now go ahead. When you have done your work you meet us." So the dog started. Suddenly big snakes were seen lying on each side of the path and they were dead. The dog came along and he was rejoicing and on account of it was wagging his tail. The dog was going along and he came to where big snakes were guarding the trail. Then he attacked them and then left them. Then he came to big bears and he also killed them. Then he went back to meet his master. He rejoiced and on account of it he wagged his tail. Mikam-</page><page sequence="72">72 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. wessu said, "Now everything is fixed all right. This is as far as I can go now. Day after tomorrow I will get where you are." He said, "Now when you go along you follow your dog. He will show you the way to the wigwam where you want to go." So White Weasel and his dog went on. Then they came to a village and right away the dog went ahead. He went to the first wigwam and wagged his tail. Then a man came out and he said, "Father, our dog, 'Bad Dog,' has come." White Weasel then went up to the door and said, "Kwe!" The answer came, "Kwe. Come in. We have company." He said to White Weasel, "Sit down here at the back end. I am glad to see a strange man. Where did you find my dog, 'Bad Dog'? I lost him a long while ago." White Weasel said, "That dog was raised with me." While they were talking a fox poked his head in and then the old woman took up the poker and struck the fox. She said, "Go right away. You are always running in whenever anyone comes visiting." He went away crying and when he came to the chief he said, "A strange man has come. He has a savage looking dog. He must have much magic." The chief said, "In a few days we will know how much magic he has." The old woman said to her sons, "Go get that tail." So one went and got a great magic whale's tail. He threw it in the fire and roasted it white. It was there cooking when a man came in and took it and carried it away. Then the old woman cried and said to White Weasel, "When anyone comes here they always test him by annoyance but perhaps they can not always do so." Then she said, "Go get another tail. He must be very hungry." Again another one got a tail. Again the old woman threw it in the fire. Again it was almost done when another man came in and quickly grabbed the tail. Then White Weasel said, "Don't touch it. I want to eat it." Then the man laughed and he said to White Weasel, "You indeed, as if you can stop me." Then he was about to go out when White Weasel grabbed his arm and pulled it from its socket. That man went to his wigwam and the chief looking at his man saw he only had one arm. The chief said, "It seems that a great magic man is in our company but his magic powers will be quickly known." Next morning Mikomwessu came and White Weasel rejoiced when he saw his friend. When the people saw these magic men, White Weasel and Mikomwessu, right away they abused them. Mikamwessu said, "Now because you abuse me your village will soon be covered with only sumach." Next morning a man came and notified White Weasel and Mikocmwessu. He said, "We are going to wrestle. It is lonesome here and we must occasionally play." White Weasel said, "I am glad. I also like to play." Mikxmwessu searched in a bark vessel and took out moccasins. He said to White Weasel, "Put these on." Then White Weasel went and started for the wrestle. When he came where they were on a solid ledge, he said, "I am ready." Then a big man came out on this ledge and as far as his knees he was sunk into the ledge. White</page><page sequence="73">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 7 3 Weasel said, "You grab me." So the man grappled with White Weasel. The man thought, "Soon I will dash him to death." But as he grappled with White Weasel he could not throw him and White Weasel landed on his feet every time. At last White Weasel said, "Let me grapple with you. Look out for me." So he grappled with the man and as he grappled he even broke off his legs and killed him with the fall. Then all the people bowed their heads and left quietly. Then White Weasel went to his wigwam. The old woman said to him, "For a long while these people have abused others and now they see what they have been looking for." Next morning a man came and said, "Will you go to play ball with us on a little island near here ?" White Weasel said, "I am willing. I am fond of playing ball." Then the whole village started for the little island to see them play ball. Then Mikcmwessu went to get ready. He went along the edge of the shore and when out of sight came to a great magic rock. He turned it over and dragged it to the water. It became a big canoe of rock and he got in and began to paddle. He came paddling back to the village and said to White Weasel, "We will start paddling." So they paddled. At last they saw a big island and when they got there and landed the chief hollered to them and said, "We are going to play ball far across the island." Then Mikomwessu said to White Weasel, "You go with them and stay behind them and when they reach the other side of the island, then you come back." So White Weasel went but he kept behind the others. The other people were happy. Then they reached the other side of the island and White Weasel turned quickly and went back to the canoes where Mikocm- wessu was already ready. He said to White Weasel, "Now jump in quickly." He jumped in and then suddenly looking they saw the people running down to the beach. Then Mikomwessu hollered and said, "My grandfather, blow the island away with a north wind." Soon such a wind blew. When they landed on the shore at the village, Mikocmwessu said, "Now we have satisfied ourselves. All bad people are dead. From now on nothing but sumach will cover their village." 27. SKUNK VISITS GLUSK 'BE1 One time Skunk set out for a long journey away from his people in the woods to become a great person. Many of his friends had done the same and become great warriors but he decided to distinguish himself in some other way than by fighting. He traveled for a long time and saw many moons. During this time he had become full grown with a beautiful creamy white coat of fur and a long bushy tail. When he stopped to visit the tribes of the animal people the girls offered to mate 1 Recorded by Molliedellis Nelson.</page><page sequence="74">74 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. with him but he would have none of them. He was on his way to find Glusko'be. At last he grew tired and decided to rest. While asleep he dreamt of a mountain where nothing but tall green grass grew. In the morning Skunk continued on his way. Again in two days he stopped to rest, but did not sleep. Then he heard two birds over his head chattering in the trees. Being able to understand them he heard them say that Glusko'be was hunting in a land near at hand and that he needed a cook. Now Skunk was an expert cook so he hurried away to find Gluskg'be. He came to a mountain with tall green grass on its sides, and when he looked again he saw smoke curling from the grass. Thinking that it was on fire he ran to the top of the mountain, and found nothing but Glusko'be sitting on a rock smoking a large pipe. From it came a sweet, strange odor. "Kwe!" called Skunk. "I heard that you want a cook." "You are a handsome fellow. I will let you cook for me," answered Glusko'be. "Nehe! Let us go home." And before Skunk could utter a sound he was whisked through the air. He closed his eyes because he was afraid. Glusko'be dropped him to the ground and when he opened his eyes he found himself in a strange land. Soon he found that not one of the strange people on the mountain could understand him. These strange people were not like him as were the other animal people below - they were the spirits of the hunting grounds and warriors of the sky. In the winter when the snow fell to the earth, Skunk was anxious to learn where snow came from. So he left the wigwam of Glusko'be and wandered among the strange people. At last he came to a large bird sitting upon the floor of the sky. Skunk learned that this was the great snow bird, whose downy feathers became snow which fell upon the earth. After he had learned about the snow bird he determined to find the eagle. The eagle had the power to fill the earth with darkness, and this he did every night. When he became tired holding up his wings in the daytime he would let them rest. This was the cause of cloudiness in the daytime. As long as the eagle held his wings up it was daylight, when he folded them it was dark. Now Skunk decided to play a trick on the animal people so he took a piece of string from Glusk%'be's wigwam and tied one of the eagle's wings. That day half of the world was dark, the other half light. Because Skunk tied the wing so tightly, no one, not even Gluskc'be, has been able to untie it. For this trick Gluskc'be emptied his pipe and with the ashes colored the skunk with smut, which accounts for his color today. Then he breathed on him and sent him down to dwell with the animal people again. As Skunk walked through the grass the grass became evil-smelling. But Gluskc'be breathed on the bad-smelling grass and it became sweet-smelling - the sweet-grass of today. Since that time Skunk must hide in the daytime</page><page sequence="75">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 75 and is seen about at night. The animal people do not consort with him or live very near him because he is evil-smelling. And the grass through which Skunk has walked is not eaten by any of the animal people. But Glusk~'be sweetened the odor and it became sweet-grass. And one more thing. When Skunk tied the eagle's wing a feather dropped out and fell on the grassy mountain. The mountain grew smaller every day until it disappeared. 28. THE ORIGIN OF CORN AND TOBACCO' A famine came upon the people and the streams and lakes dried up. No one knew what to do to make it different. At length a maid of great beauty appeared and one of the young men married her. But she soon became sad and retiring and spent much time in a secret place. Her husband followed her one day and discovered that she went to the forest and met a snake, her lover. He was sad, but he did not accuse her; he loved her so much he did not wish to hurt her feelings. He followed her, however, and she wept when she was discovered. Clinging to her ankle was a long green blade of a plant resembling grass. She then declared that she had a mission to perform and that he must promise to follow her in- structions; if so, he would obtain a blessing that would comfort his mind in sorrow and nourish his body in want, and bless the people in time to come. She told him to kill her with a stone axe, and to drag her body seven times among the stumps of a clearing in the forest until the flesh was stripped from the bones, and finally to bury the bones in the center of the clearing. He was told to return to his wigwam and wait seven days before going again to the spot. During this period she promised to visit him in a dream and instruct him what to do afterward. He obeyed her. In his dream she told him that she was the mother of corn and tobacco and gave him instructions how to prepare these plants to be eaten and smoked. After seven days he went to the clearing and found the corn plant rising above the ground and the leaves of the tobacco plant coming forth. When the corn had born fruit and the silk of the corn ear had turned yellow he recognized in it the resemblance to his dead wife. Thus originated the cultivation of corn and tobacco. These plants have nourished the bodies of the Indians ever since and comforted their minds in trouble. 29. THE MOUNTAIN LOVER There was once a young Penobscot girl who would have nobody in the village for her husband. Different men wanted to marry her but she refused them all. Once she declared that only if Kata'dan, Mountain, should come and ask her she would marry him. She used to go up on a 1 An abstract based upon a version recited by Roland Nelson.</page><page sequence="76">76 .Yournal of American Folk-Lore. hill from which the mountain was visible and gaze at it for days. One day she was at her place looking toward Kata'dan and singing a song of loneliness. Before long she heard some one near her say, "Here I am." There behind her stood a fine looking young man with a stone eyebrow over the right eye and a stone, a flint, set in his left cheek. He was dressed very well. He put out his hand and told her to come to him. As soon as she got up and touched his hand with hers, she knew nothing until she awoke to find herself with the handsome young man standing beneath a ledge of rock on a high cliff. The ledge was overhanging like a roof with no sign of an opening. But the young man pressed on a certain place and the rock swung like a door. Inside in a kind of room sat an old man, a woman, and a girl, the father, mother and sister of the handsome young man. He said to her, "Your father."' For three years she lived in the mountain with the young man Kata'dan as her husband. She bore him a son who grew up into a fine boy. But she became lone- some and wanted to see her people again. So Kata'dan said, "You may go, but during your stay don't get angry once or you will be back here again." He gave the boy power to kill ducks by pointing his first finger at them. The mother and boy returned to the village and all went well for a while. The boys of the village used to play games and sometimes young Kata'dan would get roughly used but his mother never got out of patience or scolded the others. But one day the boys were shooting blunt-headed arrows and one of them happened to hit the child on the cheek and he went home crying. When his mother saw him she flew into a rage and scolded the other boys. That night the mother and her son disappeared and were never heard from. They must live in the mountain yet. 30. KaTA'DaN'S DAUGHTER MARRIES A HUNTER There was once a Penobscot hunter who went up on Mount Katahdin to pitch his camp. When all was quiet he was startled to hear someone moving near him. Suddenly he beheld a young man standing nearby who said to him, "Come with me. Take hold of my belt." He took hold of the young man's belt behind with his hands, bent his head down behind the young man's back and closed his eyes. The young man, who was Kata'dan, started off through the air. All the other could hear was a rushing and ringing in his ears they were going so fast. Soon they stopped and he opened his eyes to find himself in front of a big ledge. Kata'dan opened the way and took him in. There was an old man, his wife, and a girl, their daughter. On a pile of boughs over in a dark corner was an old decaying hulk of a woman that moved a little as they entered. The old man Kata'dan spoke to it. "There is your son," he 1 The use of this term of relationship indicated that she was to be the old man's daughter and his wife.</page><page sequence="77">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 77 said. And the old hulk thereupon crumbled away to nothing. As they entered the cave the young girl went and stood near the entrance. As soon as the two young men went out, the girl slipped a little box into the hunter's hands in passing by. When they got outside Kata'dan left him and he went back to his village and told his story. He was a Penob- scot. Sometime afterward he went away on a hunt and did not come back. So the people made up a searching party. They searched all over Mount Katahdin but could not find him. All they found was an old camp fire but no tracks leading away from it. They say he joined his wife in the mountain. 3I. KaTA'DaN VISITS THE OCEAN Here lives my story. Kata'dan from the top of the great mountain could see something shining off in the east. It shone steadily like a spot of light and he saw it so often that he became possessed with a desire to travel over to find out what it was. Now there was an old woman who lived alone in a camp with her seven daughters. The daughters used to go off separately for fuel. One day one of the daughters heard some music off in the distance, and it sounded so nice that she listened and listened and listened. Then she started to follow it. The music sounded ever farther and farther off, but still she followed it. And she became lost deep in the woods and froze to death. The next day when she had not returned, the old woman sent one of the girls in search of the lost one. And she became charmed with the music, lured off and froze to death. Then the old woman sent another daughter to look for them. She, too, met the same end. And one after the other all were lost, and the old woman set out herself to find out what had become of them. When she had journeyed far she was met by Kata'dan. Said he, "I have knowledge of your trouble. You are now alone in the world. But if you will come with me, I will provide well for you." The old woman had nothing to do but agree and was transported to the house of Kata'dan far up in the mountain. When she was settled there, he told her he was going to make a journey. "I am going away for I don't know how long. But you will never be in want here. Whenever you want a deer just wish for one and you will have one. If you want caribou wish for that and you will have it. But stay here and keep my place until I return." With this he departed.' He faced towards the east where the shining thing was and travelled toward it, until at last he came to the great ocean of salt water. It was the shining waves of the ocean that had caught his eye upon the 1 The narrator explained that he sought the above means of bereaving the old woman so that she would have no family ties to hold her from coming to live with him. It will be noticed that in other stories his captives always wish to return to their friends before long.</page><page sequence="78">78 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. distant mountain. He waded into the water and gazed all about. Near the shore he saw a ship, which he picked up and examined. He wanted one like it. He stepped upon an island nearby and sailed upon it to strange countries across the seas.' Then I left and went away. 32. YOUNG KaTA'DaN OUTWITS THE KING Kata'dan6'sis, Young Mt. Katahdin, started out down the river and came to Penobscot Bay. There he saw a ship sailing along far out to sea. He wanted to look it over, so he waded out and picked the ship up in his hand, looking it all over inside and out like a toy. Then he set it back into the water when he had seen all its workings and let it sail on. Said he, "I ought to have a ship like that myself." From where he stood he could see an island out in the bay, so he stepped upon it and pushed it off, moving it out to sea, as a boat. That became his boat, the trees on it were his masts, and the animals on it became his sailors. The squirrels ran up and down the masts like sailors. Now he sailed off across the seas to another country. He came to the country of a great king and anchored his island in the night-time inside the king's harbor. "What," said the king on awakening the next morning, "have I lived here all these years and never seen that island before? I must send men over to cut the wood on it; it looks like fine timber." So he sent wood-cutters to the new island, but when they arrived one of Kata'dan6'sis' sailors, a squirrel, told them that his master objected. The wood- cutters went back and reported to the king. They told him that the king of the Indians had come to visit him. So the king invited Kata'- dan6'sis up to his palace, and challenged him to a contest. Said he to himself, "That Indian king is such a black-looking man he must be able to defecate very black. I will test him." So the king challenged Kata'dan6'sis to a defecating contest, to see whose excrement could be the blacker. Kata'dan6'sis returned to his island and got some black smoked moose meat. He put this in his shirt and the next day went to dine with the king. Each ate and then came the test. Kata'dan6'sis voided much the blacker excrement and so won the first test. Then the king wanted to try him again and said, "Come and eat with me tomorrow and we will see whose excrement is the whiter." Now all that night Kata'dan6'sis ate moose tallow, and in the morning went to the palace again for the contest. This time he again won the contest over the king by voiding white excrement. Before long Kata'dan6'sis saw the king's daughter and wanted to marry her, but saw no way of getting the king's consent. So he changed himself into a pismire and got into some of the princess' clothing so that he was carried into her bedroom. During the night he turned himself 1 Here follow the events in No. 32.</page><page sequence="79">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 79 back to a man. This went on for some time. The king's daughter was pregnant and the king put four guards over her bed to watch her, but they could not find out how anyone could leave or approach the princess. At last they very nearly caught him as he was trying to leave and he had to turn himself back into the pismire and crawl into the princess. She told the guard that something was tickling her insides. So they pushed a lighted candle into her to burn out Kata'dan6'sis. That killed them both. 33. TURN OVER, THE ORIGIN OF MEDICINES There was once a young girl who lived with her mother at the village. She used to like to go into the woods gathering medicinal plants. One time she wandered into the woods above the village at Indian Island, and gathered a quantity of roots. While she was strolling along a party of Mohawk, who were hovering near watching for a chance to attack the village, saw her and captured her. Then they turned back to their country and took her along. The last thing the girl did before being led away was to hide one of the roots of her stock in the bosom of her dress. On the road back to the Mohawk country they began to torture her. One time they made her hold her fingers in the blaze of the fire until the ends of her fingers were scorched. Then they named her Pa'kwa'e- kasiasit, Arrowhead Finger. She stood the pain without crying. At last they arrived at the Mohawk village and all the people came to meet the warriors with yells to see if they had captives. So the young Penobscot girl was brought in and kept until they could decide what to do with her. They held council several days and finally the chiefs decided that she should be burnt to death. And they appointed a day. But some of the Mohawk objected because the young girl was so brave and the day was put off. On the day chosen for her to be burnt, the women of the village were sent into the woods to gather stumps for the fire, and the young girl went with them helping to bring in a load of wood for her own fire. They thought this very brave and so put the day off. At last the girl bore a son. He was a small, undersized baby and grew old very fast. In a few weeks he could talk as well as any of the people and was the same as a full grown man only he was small. This son was the piece of medicine root that the girl had put in her bosom. She had not had any husband, it was a magic medicine son. At last the girl was adopted by an old man and woman who had no children left. Their sons had all been killed in the wars with the eastern Indians. So they adopted the girl and her baby as their own and so she was in no danger of being burned again. She was very good to the old people and they came to love her as their own child. So they lived for some time until the chiefs said that some captives must be burnt and they decided upon the young girl. Now the old man and woman begged the girl to run away before the day set for her death. "You escape and we will take care of</page><page sequence="80">80 o ournal of American Folk-Lore. your son," they said. But she refused saying that she would stay. They talked with her for several nights until at last she consented. The Mohawk did not keep watch over the girl because they saw she did not want to go. She went every day into the woods to gather firewood. So the old woman said, "Start the next time you go for wood. Now you run all day on the path that runs eastward. The first day you will come to an open place in the forest where there are a lot of bones. As you go through do not look behind you, no matter what you hear. That night, hide in an old cabin you will see. The next day keep on and you will rest that night. The next day you will come to a lake. There you will be met by a young man in a canoe. He will take you to a camp and then you will be among your own people, the Penobscot, and they will send you home." So she started off as the old woman told her. The Mohawk did not learn of her escape for a while so she had a good start. She was very sorry to leave her son but they urged her to go. The first day she came past the place of bones, and there lay the skulls all grinning and clacking as she passed. But she did not look back even though she could hear them right behind her. Later she came to an old cabin all fallen in, and crept beneath it into a hole, and there she slept. The next morning she heard horses' hoofs on the trail and lay low in the hole. Then she saw ten Mohawk each on a horse come by single file and they hurried past down the trail looking for her. But she lay still until she heard them coming back. She counted them until ten had passed, then she knew her path was clear and she started on again. The next day she came to the lake and there was a young man in a canoe waiting for her. Without speaking to her he paddled her across to an island where an old woman was waiting in a wigwam. "Kwe, grandchild, you have come at last," said the old woman as though she had been waiting. The girl rested there as this old woman was a Penobscot and from there she was escorted back to Indian Island, where her people had given her up as dead. They rejoiced greatly to see her back again. And there she lived with her people. As to her son left behind in the Mohawk village, when his mother left he would not leave the wigwam, nor would he eat. He just sat by the fire. So things went on, until one morning one of the babies in the Mohawk village died and no one could tell what caused its death. The next morning another died and the next morning another. This went on until the chiefs took council to try to find out what was the cause. "If we do not stop this, all of our people will be dead and we will die out." All this time the little boy never ate nor left his place. Then they set a watch on him. During the night the watcher saw him get up and go outside, and soon come back carrying a liver. This he held before the fire until it was roasted and then ate it. Then he went to sleep. The next morning a little baby was found dead and they discovered that its liver was taken out. So they found out that the medicine-boy was</page><page sequence="81">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 8 i causing the death of the children. So the chiefs held a council what to do. They said, "If we try to kill him, he is stronger in magic than we and he may kill us all. Let us go around and ask him what he wants to let us be." So they sent some chiefs to him and said, "We are sorry that we abused your mother. We know that you are killing our children and you are very strong. We do not want you to kill us all. So we will make you our head chief, so we will all be your people and you will spare us." But the medicine-boy said, "You are right. I have been killing the people and I would keep on until all were dead. Now I do not want to be your chief. But I will lie in this wigwam on my one side for one year and then I will turn over. Underneath where I have been lying, when you turn me over, you will find medicine plants growing that will cure your children. I will live forever. My name will be Gwelab'hot, Turn Over. Whenever you need medicine, turn me over and you will find the cure beneath me. I will be the father of all the Indians. I will give medicine to all the tribes for all diseases." And they agreed. Gwelab'hot is living in that village somewhere yet and every year they turn him over and the new medicine herbs grow up. He is the father of medicine. It all comes from him.1 34. KIWAKWE, THE CANNIBAL GIANT Kiw'kwe is the cannibal giant. He roams the forest seeking people to devour. He is covered with a shell through which no bullet or arrow can go. He covered himself by rolling about in balsam pitch until he had a coating three inches thick. One time a man and his wife were camping on an island. A Kiwdkwe came along and they got very much frightened. The man ran off to hide in the woods and left his wife. The old woman was so frightened that she just lay down on her back and spread her legs apart, and pulled her skirts up over her face to hide the horrible sight of the giant. There she lay on the beach of the island waiting to be killed. The giant came close and saw the old woman. He stopped and began to feel her all over to see if she was alive. He felt her privates and smelt his fingers. "No," said he, "that's spoiled." And he went on thinking she had been dead some time. Then the old woman jumped up and made for the water. She saw two logs and lay flat on them and paddled off with her hands. Then Kiwakwe looked around and saw her. He started back for her, thinking, "Well, her liver may be good anyway." But she was well out on the lake and he called after her, "Eldjdskat (your middle is rotten). 1 Wawenock version: Gwagwelab'ho't, Turn Over, was a male being. He took out his bones from his body. Then he told them to lay him on one side and to roll him over on the other side every seven years. He told them that he would put his bones back in his body again when the great war came again. 6</page><page sequence="82">8 2 fournal of American Folk-Lore. Bring me your liver. That may be good." But she cried back, "Eldjdskat your sister!" and escaped.' 35. A HUNTER VISITS A STRANGE COUNTRY AND MEETS KIWA'KWE About seventy years ago a hunter with two friends started out from near Calais, Me., and they travelled northwest. After they had been gone some time, their provisions gave out and the two companions decided to leave their guide and return. This they did and the hunter journeyed on alone. He travelled west and north for many weeks in his canoe and at last came to the shores of a great lake. Along the south shore of this he travelled a long time and at last met with two Indians who spoke a strange language. They received him kindly and took him with them. Pretty soon they came to a large village; there were many hundreds of people and they were living on the shores of the lake. When they saw their friends returning and the stranger with them the people came down to the shore and fired their guns in welcome, then carried them all in their canoes right up into the village. That night a great dance was held and the Chief took the hunter by the hand and told him to stay with them. He gave him a wigwam and they brought him a young girl, but the hunter told them he was married in his own tribe and as it was not their custom to have a strange woman he would have to refuse (sic!). Now he lived with his new friends all that winter and the next and learned their language. There were strange animals in the country that the people hunted. They resembled alligators and burrowed in the ground. They used to go and dig them out, spear them and cut up the meat into chunks large enough for a man to carry on his back by cutting a slit in each end and passing a pack strap through. He noticed that when he was carrying the meat it could stretch and contract as though breathing, sometimes slacking almost to the ground. This he did not like so he threw down his end and would have none of it. After his stay with these Indians he wanted to go home so he started back in the direction he had come. Two friends went with him to the edge of their country, then left him to go on alone. He travelled east a long ways. One day he saw some enormous footprints on the shores of a lake. And the next day he was terribly frightened to see a huge man with a mop of grizzly bear's hair dangling over his face walking along the shore and making a horrid noise. This he thought was Kiwikwe, Cannibal Giant. So he lay quiet and was not seen. But he hurried on next day and at last arrived home. He told this story of his adventures to his people and many have wondered where he could have gone and who were the Indians with whom he lived. 1 This is a black insult as it violates the joking relationship taboo, which protects one's sister from joking.</page><page sequence="83">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 83 36. THE ORIGIN OF MASKIIKCWSU, TOAD WOMAN Once a hunter, his wife, and child were camping far away in the woods. One day while he was away hunting a strange woman appeared near the camp crying loudly with grief. She begged the hunter's wife to let her caress the child to assuage her grief at having lost her own baby. When the hunter returned to camp that night he found that woman caressing his baby in her arms. He was angry. He took the baby from her and drove her away from his camp. She went off crying dismally and then became the creature of the woods. Her caresses are fatal to the children whom she reaches. People camping in the woods have to be careful of their children on account of the swamp woman. 37. PUKDJI'NSKWESSU, JUG WOMAN, HAS A STICK FOR HER HUSBAND Pukdji'nskwessu was very lonesome. She wanted to get a husband because she had no one with her. So she went out in the woods and got a big stick and tied it around her waist tight against her. Now afterwards she wanted to go out of the wigwam and tried to get rid of the stick. "You get away from me," she said, "what are you doing sticking to me ? I don't want you hanging on to me all the time." She tried to loosen the stick and get it off her. But she could not get rid of it. "I am your husband. You tied me here, and I will have to stay. You can't get rid of me now," it said. And it stuck to her so she could never get it off. Wherever she goes she carries it with her. 38. PUKDJI'NSKWESSU AND HER BEAR LOVER Here lives my story. Jug Woman and Partridge dwelt far off in a camp with their children. Partridge used to go hunting every day. But after a while his luck went. He could find no game. So before he came home one night he cut some flesh from his thigh and packed it to camp. His wife cooked it and they had it for supper. The next night he did the same and kept on until after some days he had cut nearly all the meat from his legs and he had to stuff them with birch so they would look fat. That is why partridges have such thin legs nowadays. Now Partridge's wife, Jug Woman, used to go off in the woods and consort with a bear while Partridge was away hunting. When she grew tired of partridge leg meat, which was rank with the taste of birch buds, Jug Woman, while her husband was away, got her bear lover to cut some meat from his leg for her to bring home. So in this way she provided meat for her family for awhile. One day the children told Partridge something about Jug Woman and how she went away into the woods every day to meet somebody. So Partridge decided to follow her. When he learned about it, he went to the bear's cave and killed the bear, cut off his leg meat and packed it home to his wife to cook. When all had eaten of the flesh Partridge told Jug Woman what she was 6*</page><page sequence="84">84 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. eating. She knew then that he had killed the bear, and cried very badly. She wandered off into the woods and roams there yet. There it ends. 39. PUKDJI'NSKWESSU MARRIES FISHER AND HER SON DESTROYS HIM Here lives my story. Jug Woman at last would marry Fisher for a mate. And they had two children. Bear came and stole Fisher's babies. And when Fisher went away Bear stole Fisher's wife. Finally Jug Woman in her new family association drove her elder son from the camp. Then she got hungry. Meanwhile her elder son had made a hunting camp of his own and had stored up lots of meat. And when Jug Woman became too hungry she went to sleep where her son was and she moved to join him. She came to where he was and slept there. And while she slept her son took his bow and placed it to form a bridge over the fire in the camp. Fisher then started to approach him to consume him as he had expected. When he came across on the bow over the fire separating them, the son tripped the bow with his foot, the bow turned over and Fisher fell down into the fire, - that Fisher. And then that Fisher died. Jug Woman became a widow. She went down to the sea to pick up little shells and made a necklace for mourning. That is all. 40. THE WATER DWARF GRANTS THREE WISHES A hunter, his wife, and a child were once long ago camping by the side of a lake. One night a great storm blew up and the lake became much disturbed. In the morning the man went out to see it and there on the beach he found an Alambigwin6sis almost dead. He took him back to camp and nursed him on the way until he was revived. But the hunter's wife was not pleased when she saw the dwarf. And they disputed as to whether he should be killed. The dwarf pleaded for his life and promised the hunter and his family three wishes if they would free him. The hunter consulted with his wife who at last agreed, and they restored the little brown creature to his lake. The family now had three wishes to be granted and knowing nothing better to do, packed up and went to the trading post to make their choice. The woman had first choice, and finally after looking over the trader's stock settled her fancy upon a broom. Immediately the broom came to her hands no sooner had she wished. Hurrying to the wigwam with her broom she showed what she had gotten to her husband. He became very angry. "What did you take that thing for ? You have thrown away one wish and now we have only two left. I wish you had it up your anus." And immediately the broom stick leaped where he said and the woman was half killed. She carried on so, that nothing could be done until the child, who held the last wish, wished the broom was out of his mother. And it was out on the instant. The people were very poor, they lost their wishes and got nothing for them. There is the end.</page><page sequence="85">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 85 41. THE ORIGIN OF THE WATER NYMPH FAMILY Once upon a time, a long time ago, some boys went up the river to fish. They went up above the islands and caught a lot of black-chubs (Awusk'h6wak, spies). The boys cut off their heads and stuck the heads on pointed sticks and stood them upright in the bow of their canoe. When they came down the river and neared the island they began singing a war song. An old man heard them and told the people in the village that the boys were coming home with enemies' heads on poles in their canoe. When they got nearer the people saw they were nothing but fish heads and they made them stop singing to avert misfortune. Now one of these boys was named Mindowa-'mek'w, Devil Fish or Spirit Fish. He gathered the boys and told them that they would all go back and this time they would have better luck. So they again ascended the river. Before they had gone far they met two creatures paddling a canoe toward them. These men had very narrow faces and very large noses which they covered with their hands as they came near the boys. They did this because they were so ugly. When they came close they said to the boys, "Mohawks are camped up the river," and passed on. These two creatures were Wanagameswak, water nymphs. Now the boys led by Devil Fish ascended quietly and made camp for the night up the river near the Mohawk camp. They waited till night when the Mohawks were asleep, then they went in and cut off the Mohawks' heads. The next morning they returned to the village, this time with the heads of the Mohawks on poles in the bow of their canoe. They sang their war song. But this time no one told them to stop. For this great deed Devil Fish became the founder of a family. His descendants formed the water nymph family and band. 42. THE BEAR ABDUCTOR1 A boy named Polis, when he was old enough to walk, went with his father and mother to pick blueberries. When they reached a place where the berries were plentiful, they left the child and went a short distance. When the mother went back to see if the child was all right, she could not find her baby. She called her husband, and they made a search, but could not find him. A bear had carried him away. The bear took care of the baby for seven years. The bear became the mother of the child. One day the (male) bear spoke to the child and told him that the hunters were after him, and that he would be killed. But, before he was killed, he would take him to his parents. He wanted the child to promise that when he grew to be a man he never would kill a mother bear. 1 Another version of practically the same story is given in Leland and Prince, p. 239.</page><page sequence="86">86 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. The bear took the boy near to the home of his parents and when they found the child, he could not speak. It took him a few years to learn. He could not remember when the bear had taken him away. When he grew up to be a man, he was very lucky in hunting. He got married and had a family to take care of, but he would never kill a mother bear. One day his wife said he must kill a mother bear, as the meat was nice and fat, so he did as his wife wished and killed a mother bear. Soon after he was missed and never could be found. Since then he has been called the "Polis Bear." 43. THU GHOST HUNTER1 Many years ago an Indian and his family started on a journey in the fall of the year. It was the custom among the Indians to get wild meat to live on through the winter, and to dry some for the summer. When this man reached a spot where he wished to camp for the winter he began to make a wigwam. He saw that a squall was coming, so he went to get his canoe. As he was shouldering his canoe he struck a dry spruce log, and a branch which was very sharp struck him in the heart, and he was killed. The canoe fell over him, and his spirit went back and finished the wigwam, but never a word would he speak to his wife or his children. All that winter he slept by himself near the fire. When he went hunting he always had good luck, and he furnished all his wife needed. In the spring when the river was open, he spoke to his wife and told her how he had been killed. And she should take the canoe, pitch it so that it would not leak, and, with provisions enough for a three days' journey, start homeward with the children. At the end of three days he told her she would meet friends. The woman did as directed, and found a family and told her story. The men went to the place and found the body which they brought to Indian Island for burial. 44. THE DESERTED WIFE2 A man once got angry with his wife. In order to be rid of her he took her away, and deserted her on an island (which some think was Indian Island). He left her there, thinking that before long she would die of hunger and cold. But the woman was wise and knew what to do. She got hungry and went around the island trying to find a place or a cave for shelter and a place where she could eat. While doing so she found rabbits, which she killed and ate. She made a wigwam out of bark, and clothes out of the rabbit skins. In this way she continued to live. After many years had passed her brothers found her and took her back to her home. The husband was found and killed. 1 Contributed by Philip J. Lola. 2 Same source as preceding.</page><page sequence="87">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 87 45. VARIANT One time there was a husband who became fond of another woman. He wanted to get rid of his wife. So he started off with her on a trip and came to a large island, probably Mount Desert in Penobscot Bay, and landed there. He got his wife to leave the camp for some reason and then jumped in his canoe and paddled off. For a long time she remained alone on the island until some other Indians, Passamaquoddies, happened to land there and took her off to the mainland. Then she made her way back to the village and slipped quietly into her father's wigwam. Her husband was living with the other woman and had told the people that his wife had been lost. The next morning the wife's menfolk went to the husband's wigwam and called him outside. "We have come to tell you about your lost wife," said they, and the old man knocked him on the head with his club as soon as he came within reach. 46. THE MAGIC FILIGHT A shaman was once pursuing a man whom he wanted to kill. When the chase started the man was given a whetstone, some soap, some punk fungus, and an awl to help him in his flight. When the shaman gained on the man he threw down his soap and it became a bed of quaking mud. The shaman could hardly get through this but at last succeeded and began gaining on the victim again. This time the man threw down his whetstone and this became a wall of rock which stopped the shaman until he got an army of woodpeckers to pick it to pieces for him. Then he went on again, and soon gained on the man. Then the man threw down his punk. This turned into a burning tract. The shaman could hardly live getting through this place but at last he succeeded, and began gaining on the man again. Lastly the man threw down his awl. This became a thicket of thorns which entangled the shaman. In spite of his efforts he could not free himself and there he stuck. The man then escaped and got home. 47. MAGIC FLIGHT FROM THE AMOROUS COUSIN Here lives my story. There lived a young man who was in love with his cousin. He used to make his way to her at night until he was driven from her home. Off he went in the woods and disguised himself with other clothes and came to see her as a stranger. She received him unbeknownst, and he consorted again with his cousin. One day, how- ever, while he was lying with the girl her mother chanced upon them. Immediately the girl fled and her cousin pursued her. A companion joined the young girl in her flight. They had a pair of magic snowshoes upon which one could skim over mountains and valleys. But there was only one such pair. The young girl took one shoe and her companion the other, so they were both able to skim over the country, with an ordinary</page><page sequence="88">88 [Journal of American Folk-Lore. snowshoe on the other foot. Away they sped with the cousin in pursuit. They came at last to a steep ledge and sped over the edge. Along came the pursuer who tumbled over after them and was killed. But there is more to this story. 48. MAGIC MEDICINE OF YOUTH AND OLD AGE1 Long ago there was a man in a village by a lake. He wanted to punish some women, they say, for something they did to him, or some way they treated him. He went to his uncle and asked advice. His uncle told him what to do. The man then paddled in his canoe across the lake to where a snake sorcerer lived and got some medicine from him that would make the young old and the old young again. When the man returned to the village, the people were busy dancing and having a great time. He went to a wigwam where all the young girls sat laughing and talking and smoking. Then he gave them some of his medicine herbs to smoke. As they smoked they gradually grew older and older until the wigwam was tenanted by a group of cackling old hags in place of the maidens. Then he turned about and gave some of his medicine to the old women who were smoking together and behold, they became a noisy group of dancing young maidens. 49. THE ABANDONED WOMAN A long time ago there was a party travelling by canoe. With them was a woman so old and covered with vermin that she could not help herself in any way. To take her on with them delayed them so much that they were afraid they would starve to death as they had bad luck hunting. So they decided to leave her behind. They came to an island, made a camp for her, gave her what little food they could spare and then left. When the old woman was left alone she knew what fate held in store. The island was very barren. Now the first thing she did was to hobble around and see what she could find. She went along the shore. Before long she came upon a piece of rope and with this she made some snares. By setting them the next morning she had caught some rabbits. Soon after she found a little box on the shore with some tobacco in it. Now she soon had some clothes made of rabbit skins and dried the rabbit meat. And she smoked her tobacco, living on what she snared. Her relations went on their journey. They did not do very well. A long time afterwards they happened to be passing near the same island, and they thought, "We'll go ashore here now and bury the bones of our grandmother." They expected she had died long ago. But when they landed they beheld smoke coming from the camp and there was the old woman with quantities of dried rabbit meat and skins. She was very 1 Cf. Leland, p. 327 (Passamaquoddy).</page><page sequence="89">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 89 glad to see them again and shared all her stores with them. They all feasted and enjoyed themselves as they were nearly starving before that. The old woman who had saved them, they kept with them, and there is the end. 50. THE WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO A SNAKE1 The cradle board which belonged to Si-sul has a story. That cradle board never was used by the maker because a very strange thing happened. This is the story, and it is a true one of a very long time ago. A man and his wife had no children but wanted them very much. After some time the wife became pregnant and both felt very glad. The husband was so proud that he set to work to make a cradle board as was the custom. But the cradle he made was to be finer than any ever seen. For months he labored, stained it with alder bark and carved it front, back and sides. Nothing like it had ever been seen. And he thought of nothing but his child that was to come. At last the baby was to be born and the proudest man in the village expected his long desired offspring. But he had shown too much pride. A snake was born in place of the baby. That was the result. That cradle board was never to be used by him. 51. HOW A HUNTER'S LIFE WAS SAVED BY A FETISH There was once a hunter who, every time he killed a deer, cut out the first joint of the backbone below the skull, cleaned it and put it away respectfully in his camp. He always did this though for no other reason than that the bone looked like a human face with its two eyes and nose. One time he was prodding in a beaver meadow for the animal's runway when the surface caved in and he fell up to his armpits in mud. There was no way to get out and he was sinking. The water and mud had come up to his chin and he was thinking of everything he knew for help but none came and he had almost given up. But he saw another man just then, doing what he had been doing, prodding with a stave for the beaver runs. He tried to call for help. But he could not find his voice, try as he might. The other man seemed to be going aimlessly around prodding but only coming very slowly. He feared he would drown before the stranger chanced upon him. Pretty soon when he was almost submerged the poor hunter saw the man prodding right alongside of him and in a minute he found himself pulled out safely on the bank. When he got his breath he wanted to thank the rescuer. He told him how thankful he was but said he did not know how to repay him. Then the rescuer spoke and said, "Do you know what my name is? It is Waski-'docmbewit, Become-a-Man, and I am the bone which you always 1 The cradle board referred to in this story is the identical one now in the Heye collection, Museum of the American Indian. It is rather re- markable that all the Penobscot who know this story attribute it as above to the maker of the cradle board referred to.</page><page sequence="90">90 /ournal of American Folk-Lore. clean and put away when you kill a deer. For years you have taken care of me, and now I will take care of you. Whenever you need help just think of me again, and I will come and help you as I did just now." Since that time hunters generally do as he did, save the bone from the deer's neck to protect themselves from misfortunes. 52. THE LEGEND OF PROFILE ROCK There was once an Indian girl whose brother fell in love with her. She became afraid of him and fled westward toward the great white mountains (White Mountains, New Hampshire). But he started in pursuit and followed her from peak to peak, valley to valley. Then the girl somehow acquired shaman's power. When he had almost overtaken her, she looked back towards where he was coming down the mountain side and he turned to rock. His face looking toward her is still to be seen high on the mountain side (Profile Rock, Franconia Hotel, New Hampshire). At the same time she herself turned to stone and now exists on the opposite slope. My grandmother told me this story and I have heard that there were faces in stone in those mountains though I have never been there myself. There was a great deal more to the legend but I can not recall it. 53. A MAN MARRIES HIS COUSIN AND BECOMES A LOON Long ago in a village there was a man who fell in love with his cousin. Cousins were forbidden to marry. This man would pretend to go away on long hunting trips, and his cousin would take her basket and set out to go gathering berries. Then she would go around and they would meet secretly. He would stop in some place and sing songs that she liked and no matter how far away she might be she would hear them and be guided to where he lay. After awhile the village separated and broke up into hunting camps, and the lovers managed to meet just the same. Soon, however, the girl's brothers learned something about it and the family came to find it out. When her brothers returned from their hunt they were very angry at this incest, and they started off to find and kill their cousin. The girl heard of their purpose and hurried ahead to warn her cousin. She followed near her brothers. Soon they came out on a frozen lake. Her lover was seen coming toward them on the ice, and the girl sped out to warn him. She carried her baby in her arms. Her brothers followed in pursuit. When she reached her cousin he hugged her to his breast; as he did this he killed her and she fell dead in his arms. Immediately a gap opened in the ice and the young man sank through. The next instant he arose in the form of a bird uttering mournful cries and mocking laughter. That was the loon, and that is why we hear the loon crying. He arose into the sky and forms a group of stars there, Made'wi'te, Loon.</page><page sequence="91">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 91 54. VARIANT There was a man who used to make love to his first cousin in secret. Finally to escape censure for this act he ran away taking the girl with him, and dwelt in a distant place. A year or so after, the girl's father moved away from his old home to search for a region where the hunting was better. In the course of his journey he came to the camp where his daughter and her cousin husband lived by a lake and saw a quantity of baby cloths drying near the camp. He knew by the signs of occupation that it was a good district and he moved his family up and joined the group. The girl was warned to beware of her father's wrath, because the people there were divided in opinion as to what should be done about the affair. Some were in favor of the girl, others wanted to have her killed for punishment. Her husband also had a warning of coming trouble. It soon came and the two parties of people in the camp fell to fighting in earnest. In the struggle the husband was attacked and the girl ran out to be with him. He put his arms about her and in an instant she fell dead with an arrow in her back shot by her father. The husband felt so bad that he desired all the people to be killed. Using his power he cried aloud for the ice upon the lake where they were struggling to break and sink. It broke and the entire party sank and drowned in the lake. The husband turned instantly into a loon and flew off crying into the sky. That is why the loon is always crying so mournfully, for he is calling his mate. 55. THE LAZY HUNTER AND HIS DEER WIFE Hunters were camping in the woods. One of their young men was very lazy, very fond of sleeping. At last they became tired of him. They called him Malkok, Lazy, and decided to abandon him while he was asleep. When he awoke at last and, looking about, saw no one there he became very hungry. He searched around for some food but did not find it. He became very discouraged and thought to himself, "Here is where I shall probably starve where I sit." Suddenly a woman appeared. She said to Malkok, "Do not become discouraged, for soon I shall bring you food." She left and after awhile came back bringing venison. She cooked it and they ate. When they had eaten she said to Malkok, "Now take courage and hunt. I will help you and soon to be sure we shall have plenty of everything for food." Kii! Indeed he hunted and Malkok obtained plenty of beasts, deer, moose, bears, kii! He secured an abundance of everything. That woman cured and stored a quantity of all kinds of meat. Then in the spring the woman said, "You must build a canoe." So Malkok built a canoe, a great magic canoe. The woman said to Malkok, "Now go; take this food down to your village for your people. Divide it among them. And you stay there until the hunting is good again. But also do not forget me." And Malkok got in his canoe</page><page sequence="92">92 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. and went to his village where he belonged. The people there were sur- prised at Malkok on account of so much food and fur. Kii! They were glad, his people. Then they had a dance. Kii! And then the girls desired him because he was so smart. He did not notice them but stayed on. Then the hunting season came around again and he went back to the woods where he had been before. Kii! the woman (of the winter before) was glad when he came. And again he hunted and again he obtained lots of fur and game. Then when spring came it happened that a little child was born to him. Again the woman told him to go down to his relatives bringing the food. Kii! they rejoiced. Then they coaxed him to marry there. After he had refused twice, the third time he consented and then he married. When the hunting season came again he went to the woods and hunted as before. Then the woman of the previous years came before him and said, "You have at last forgotten me. Now as long as you live do not ever kill a deer. But come here to your wigwam just the same every hunting season." When spring came he went as before to his village. And he hunted as usual but never killed a deer. Finally his wife said, "What is the matter with you! You never bring deer meat, nothing but moose meat, bear meat, caribou meat. I crave deer meat. You must bring deer meat! Now search for deer. You must bring that!" So sure enough he hunted deer. He went to his hunting camp in the woods and when he got there the woman did not come to greet him joyfully. But after awhile she did come with her daughter, and said, "Now you deceived me. Never again will you see us." Then he pleaded with her, he cried pleading with her. And she said, "The last you will see of us! You stand here at the door, for I and my daughter go together. Because of the other woman you killed your daughter and your wife as you were commanded. Now watch us go!" So he stood in the doorway. When they had gone a little way he tried to follow them. They went along trotting at an easy gait. Malkok tried to catch up with them. But suddenly they turned into deer - a doe and her fawn! 56. VARIANT There was once a very lazy man named Knkskias, Little Cedar. He was a short man. He would neither hunt nor work for the people. So his family went away quietly and abandoned him leaving only enough food with him for one meal. When he awoke the morning after he found out what had happened. Then he started traveling. At length he saw smoke and came upon a wigwam where a good-looking woman lived. She gave him a good meal and as he liked everything there he stayed and married her. She was in reality a deer. She was very industrious so Little Cedar had nothing to do yet they amassed a quantity of provisions. Soon a little girl was born to them. At last Little Cedar wanted to return to see his people and they went taking lots of things to give away.</page><page sequence="93">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 93 While there Little Cedar went to a dance where he met a girl whom he liked very much. He danced with her. Returning to his wigwam after- wards he found his wife in a sulky mood. She would not turn her face toward him. But he made up with her. The next night he went to the dance and danced all night with the same girl again. When he went home he found his wife and child turned into deer. His wife then told him never to kill a deer or he would kill his own kin, after which he went and lived with the other girl. She desired all kinds of meat and at last asked for deer meat since Little Cedar never brought any of that. Finally she forced him to go for deer meat and he started off. Soon he saw a doe and fawn. He shot and killed the fawn. When he walked up to it he found that it was his own little girl lying dead where he thought he had killed a fawn. The doe had run away. 57. TALKING DOGS, AND THE KIND AND CRUEL MASTERS There were two men hunting in separate camps not far from each other. One of them had a smart dog that found bear and other game for him. He fed his dog well. The other man was very cruel to his dog. One night the dog belonging to the cruel man went to see the dog of the kind man. The latter man was asleep but he awoke when he heard the dogs begin to talk. He heard the dog of the cruel man say to his dog, "Your master is good to you and that is why you help him. Like you, I, too, see lots of bear, deer and other animals and their tracks, but I would not tell my owner. Your owner is indeed good to you. He feeds you out of an ivory dish." By an ivory dish he meant the man's two hands and finger nails. The man hearing this talk went over to the cruel man the next day and asked if he would part with his dog. "Yes, take him!" said he. "No, but I will buy him," said the first. So he bought the poor dog. He took him to hunt and the poor dog rewarded his new owner by hunting down all kinds of game and the kind owner had a good hunt. The first owner of the poor dog wanted to buy him back when he learned of this but the kind hunter would not sell him. This dog's name originally was Sagi.nocgwzu, Stingy. 58. A LOVER AND A HOLE IN THE WIGWAM1 Once there lived a man in a camp. He and his wife lived in a wigwam. His wife used to cohabit with other men. One used to come regularly. She had a small hole cut through the back of the wigwam covering near where she slept so that when all were asleep her lover could cohabit with her from the outside. The hole was just large enough for his member, 1 This is said to have taken place at the Indian village of Brewer, opposite Bangor, Maine. This identical story is told in practically every tribe from Ontario to the Atlantic Ocean.</page><page sequence="94">94 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. and she would lie against the wall. This went on for some time until her husband became suspicious. One night he made her move away from the wall and quickly cut off the intruder's penis with his knife. The severed portion fell inside. Then he made his wife roast it and eat it for punishment. 59. THE MAN WHO COULD NOT GET MARRIED Once two strange Indians came to a village for a visit. One of them wanted to get married. He sent wampum' to the family of the girl but her family sent it back. Then he tried another and it was refused there. Try as he might he had no success and could not get a girl. After a while he noticed that two girls would pass his wigwam every evening, one of them being the girl he first tried to marry. So he cut a round hole in the side of his wigwam and stuck his penis through it so that they would see it when they passed. When the girls came by the next time, one of them spied it and they stopped to investigate. "Mm! See there," she said to her companion, "what can that be ?" They looked it over well. "Looks like a stick of wood," said one. "No, it must be a bone," said the other, "for see how the marrow oozes out at the end." "Ah, yes," agreed the first, "just so. What a stout bone it is." And then they passed on. The first girl knew, however, that the only occupant of the wigwam was this man and she soon found a way to let him know she would have him, and they got married. 60. THE BASHFUL BROTHER A young man was once out hunting ducks with his sister in a canoe. He was seated in the bow ready to shoot any game he might see and she was paddling in the stern. He had a great need to break wind, but was ashamed to do so in his sister's presence.2 When he saw some ducks ahead he raised his gun to fire. He took aim, and intended to break wind the moment he fired so he would not be heard. But his gun missed fire, and he broke wind loudly. He leaned forward, bent his head on his arms and never moved again. He was dead from shame. 61. WHY THE NEGRO IS BLACK There was once a boy who laughed constantly at his parents. Every time they said anything he would laugh till he was black in the face. So he became black and the father of the negro race. They are always laughing and showing their teeth. 1 Wampum was the proper medium of proposal. The suitor sent the wampum to the girl's family; if they accepted it the answer was favorable. 2 One of the severest violations of the sister taboo. No joking was proper in the presence of a sister.</page><page sequence="95">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 95 62. THE TRADER WHOSE HAND WEIGHED A POUND Long ago down on Saco river there was a trader. He bought the Indians' furs and paid them according to weight. He had a big balance scales. When he would weigh out the Indians' furs he would put his hand on one of the pans and hold down as hard as he could until the load on the other pan was heavy enough to raise his hand. This is how he weighed beaver skins by the pound. He called his hand a pound weight in buying. He dealt them their returns so much the pound according to the metal weights. After awhile the Indians got to mistrust the trader and they killed him. Then they cut off his hand and weighed it. And they found that it weighed just a pound. At this they felt very sorry for their mistake. 63. THE ORIGIN OF THE MEDICINE SWEET FLAG Long ago all the people were dying off with a kind of cholera. Nothing that was done could help them. All medicines failed. One night during these times a man had a dream. He dreamt that a person came to him and said, "All the people are dying off and nobody can cure them. But I will show you a cure. I am Muskwessuwesk, Muskrat Root,' and when you take me and steep me in water for medicine you and everyone who drinks me will be cured. Now come with me and I will show you where I am to be found." So he took the man to a swamp and showed him the root; then disappeared. When the dreamer awoke he went to the place he had visited in his dream. As he knew just where to go he found the root, took it back and made medicine. The people took it and were cured. They were saved and so is everyone nowadays who takes this medicine for cholera. 64. THE ORIGIN OF INDIAN SUMMER This is an old, old story,2 and I am telling it as I heard the old people tell it since as far back as I can remember. It is about an old man named Zimo who went to the Master3 to ask for aid. The people in the village used to plant and raise their vegetables in the summer and dry them for provisions through the winter. Now when the planting season came on this man, Zimo, got sick and his sickness clung to him all summer until fall so that he could not do his planting. The other people got in their vegetables but this man had none. So he went to the Master for help. He said, "I have been sick all through planting and harvesting time and now winter is coming on and I have no provisions." And he asked him to help him. Then the Master told him, "Go ahead. Plant your things 1 Sweet flag (Acorus calamus). 2 The narrator added that it dated back to the time of Christ. 3 Inferably Gluskm'be.</page><page sequence="96">96 _Yournal of American Folk-Lore. now and you will have a crop right away." Zimo went home and straight- way put his seeds into the ground. The weather favored him and as soon as he had finished planting, his crops were ready to harvest. It took him seven days and at the end he had as much as the other people. Then winter came on. They called that warm season "person's summer," and it comes again every year. 65. THE MISSING HUNTERS TRACED IN A TRANCE There was an old man and his son, who went hunting. His wife and daughter-in-law did not like to stay at home so they went with him. They built their camp out of boughs and made a fire in the midst of their camp and a place where the smoke could go through. The father and son went out hunting and left the women alone at the camp. They were to be back in three days, but at the end of three days they did not return. The son's wife got weary and did not know what kept them so long, since it was four or five days they had been gone. That night the mother-in-law, who was very fond of smoking, lay down near the fire to smoke. Her daughter-in-law was lying in one corner of the camp on her bed of boughs. The old woman told the young woman that she was going to sleep and dream about where they were, and what they were doing. After she got through smoking she lay down on her back. Finally her daughter-in-law saw a ball of fire come out of her mouth. She became very frightened. She jumped up and tried to arouse the woman; she turned her on her side and shook her; she decided that she was dead, and was very frightened. The ball of fire that came from the old woman's mouth went round the camp. When the daughter-in-law saw the ball of fire coming back, and going around the camp and around the old woman she did not know what to do. She turned her mother-in- law over again, and when she did so the ball of fire went back into her mouth. The old woman began to move about. She said she had a great sleep. She said, "Don't worry they will be back to-morrow. They had good luck and are bringing lots of game. I just saw them sitting around their fire eating their supper." The next morning the hunters appeared with an abundance of game of all sorts. 66. ANT'S UNFINISHED TALE Here camps my story. Red Ant' was always wandering about. When he came back he would bring all kinds of news and tell it to the people. And they would marvel at it. At last he started off as he wished to take 1 This is the commonly known Red Velvet Ant, Mutilla occidentalis (Luin.), belonging to the hymenoptera, not an ant at all. It is only the female which has the red furry surface, and possesses the sting.</page><page sequence="97">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. 97 a long trip to search for news. He wandered far away. At last he suddenly recollected, "It is high time that I go back; for already I have a mass of news." Then he started back to his home. He said, "I have brought news! Tomorrow I will tell you all." KVi'!i The people were glad over it, that he was going to tell them such strange happenings, this Red Ant. The next morning they assembled to listen to him, to whatever news he had to tell. Then the Red Ant caught a cold. When he came in he said, "I have rumors and happenings to relate soon. I will relate them to you. On account of my cold wait till I blow my nose." Thereupon he blew his nose, by doing which he twisted off his head.' 67. THE GREAT LIBERTINE Ktci maskq'be, Great Bad Man, met a woman and began to coax her. The woman said, "Yes, I will let you do it but you must go into the bushes a short way and make a little dark wigwam. Then after you go I will see you there. But go by my wigwam so that I will know that you have made the little wigwam and so that I can go on ahead." Accordingly Great Bad Man went and built a little dark wigwam. He hurried very eagerly for he wanted to cohabit with the woman. Then he went rapidly past where she lived. Then the woman went out quickly to the little wigwam. There she defecated and went out and walked to her wigwam. Great Bad Man walked to the little wigwam. He was sure that he would soon be cohabiting with the woman. Then he went in and hearkened for an answer and he whispered and said, "Which way ?" "Sh!" He listened for the "sh" again and then he moved quickly toward it. When he reached out his arm he straightway got hold of a great big excrement. Then again he heard the noise "sh" in another direction and again he jumped toward it and again he got hold of an- other excrement. Then he swore very hard. "Big woman she has lied to me!" 68. RACCOON OUTWITS THE BEAR2 Here lives my story, the raccoon story. Hee! He started out and went about the woods playing tricks on the different creatures, trying to beat them in different ways. As he was going along he saw an old bear. So he took some rabbit excrement and fixed it up to look like some corn-food and offered it to Bear. "Here is some nice abasiddman (crushed corn). Have a little to eat." Bear took it and when he had eaten it, the raccoon cried after him, 1 The point of which is, the ant has such a slender neck that when he blew his nose "with a jerk of the finger," the violence of this action decapi- tated him. 2 Cf. Leland, p. 18o (Passamaquoddy). 7</page><page sequence="98">98 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. mu' wi'n itc mu' wi-n itel "Bear-ch, Bear-ch" (in receding tones), and told him what he had been eating. "You have been munching rabbit's excrement, old creature," cried the raccoon. Now when he heard this he became very angry and started after Raccoon. Then Raccoon ran off and escaped into a hole. When Bear came up he called and tried to get him out to kill him. "The only way you can kill me is to stick your testicles in after me," said he to Bear. Bear put his testicles into the hole and Raccoon scratched them and killed him. Then he went on. But he took with him some of the bear's skin and had a fine pair of mittens made. 69. RACCOON KILLS THE YOUNG SABLES AND ESCAPES BY A RUSE2 He went on, and pretty soon came upon a family of young sables. Their parents were away hunting. Raccoon said to them, "If you will look me over and pick lice, I'll give you something. This nice pair of bear skin mittens." He lay down and the young sables began to louse him. He fell into a doze. Before long they caught all of his lice but one, and in trying to get this last one they finally woke Raccoon out of his nap. He was cross, and to pay them, he turned upon the young sables and started to kill them all. One, however, the youngest, escaped and hid beneath a bark vessel. Then Raccoon took those he had killed and ran a stick through the rectum of each to its mouth to pry it open and left them lying there gaping and looking as though they were only hungry. When the old sables came home they saw their young looking so hungry with mouths agape all in a row, and started to feed them. But they were dead. Thereupon they looked around, and the one who had escaped came out of hiding. "Who did this?" He could not answer but took a burnt stick and painted a black line around each eye and from the corners of his mouth across his cheeks, like the stripes on the raccoon's face. "Oh! it's Raccoon," they cried and started after him. Still Raccoon went on. Pretty soon the old Sable began to gain on him, and at last caught him in a swamp. "Now," said he, "I will kill you." "Well! the only way you can do that is to hit me with a cattail stalk. That's the only thing that can hurt me!" he told him. So Sable took a cattail stalk and struck the raccoon on the head. And Raccoon fell over as though he were dead and lay still. The fuzz from the cattail flew up in clouds and Sable thought he had knocked out Raccoon's brains. Then Sable departed. He only got a little way off when Raccoon 1 This is Malecite or Micmac; mnui'n, bear. 2 Cf. Leland, p. 181 (Passamaquoddy).</page><page sequence="99">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 99 jumped up as much alive as ever and began to sing after the sable to plague him, "Sable! Sable!" Pan nak kes su! pan nak kes su! So he got away safely and journeyed on. 70. RACCOON, DROWNED IN THE RAPIDS, ESCAPES FROM THE OLD WOMEN1 Now Raccoon was going along again when he heard the roaring of the river over the rapids. He thought he could make more noise than that, so he went to the edge and began to shout and cry to show that he could outdo the rapids. He shouted so much that he got out of breath, got dizzy all of a sudden, fell in and was drowned. While he was floating down the river two old women came along and found him. They dragged him out of the water, took him to their camp, skinned him and put him in the pot whole to cook him. They left his skin hanging upon a branch just outside the door. When they got him boiling in the pot they sat down nearby to sew and wait for their dinner to get cooked. When they had their backs to each other, Raccoon would spatter some of the scalding water on one and then the other. Each old woman blamed the other for it until they fell to quarrelling. During the fight Raccoon jumped out of the pot, ran to his skin, quickly slipped it on and then bolted off. 71. RACCOON AND THE ROLLING STONE CAPTOR So Raccoon went on looking for something else to meddle with. He was always meddling with something. Soon he came to a big rock on the hillside and began to meddle with it until he loosened it and it started rolling down the hill. "I can run much faster than that rock," said he, and started off downhill ahead of it. He got way ahead but then slowed up and let it almost catch up with him. Then he began zigzagging in front of it to show how much he could do. But all of a sudden the rock came down on him and rolled over him crushing him to bits. Now Raccoon called for help. He called to the ants (pismires) to come and put him together again. The ants heard him and came. They gathered up his blood and all the pieces of bone and put the raccoon all together again. But they kept one of his testicles, and it was some time before he could get it back again. There he and I dwelt. Here it ends. 1 Cf. Leland, p. 174 (Passamaquoddy). 7*</page><page sequence="100">S100 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. 72. VARIANT Next Raccoon was going along in the woods. Thought he, "I am going to climb the mountain." When he came to the top he looked all about him and the world looked beautiful to him. As he was going along over the ground he saw a big rock. Kii! He walked up to it and said, "Grandpa, let us run a race." Then said the rock, "I cannot, grandson. It is a long time that I have sat here; if you help me I can run, but I myself cannot move out. But if someone helps me I can indeed run for I am already very tired of staying here." "Surely I will help you, grandpa. I shall look for a tree (to use as a pry)." After he had moved the rock from its bed it commenced to roll down the mountain. Kii! Raccoon ran ahead, then he ran zigzag and at last he stumbled and fell down flat. Aaa! the rock kept on rolling; it went on top of him and crushed him to death, that Raccoon. Then it ends. 73. RACCOON SNARES THE HARE Another little story of Raccoon. They say he was travelling along with Rabbit and thinking of some way to get control over him. Then they came to where the rabbits were having a council and dance. "Sh!" said Rabbit, and they stopped to listen. In an instant Rabbit slipped away and warned the others, I guess. And Raccoon got fooled again. Now he made a snare. He took a piece of hide and fastened a noose of it to a cross-stick. Then he left it where the rabbit used to run through the thicket. Pretty soon Rabbit came along. "Hm! what is this? I'll have to look into this affair." He put his head through it and got tightened up in it some way and choked to death. That's how Raccoon caught him at last, though there is more to the story. 74. RACCOON'S CHILDREN ARE KILLED BY FISHER The camp of Fisher was once found by Raccoon who killed all the children except the youngest when he tried to put them to sleep and found that he could not. That is what made him so angry. After killing them he left them with sticks inserted in their mouths so that they would appear laughing and alive. When old Fisher returned and found them thus he took up the trail of Raccoon and gave chase. He soon came to a camp where there were some old women braiding basswood packstraps. He astonished them by throwing a roll of the material into the fire and bringing out a nice finished packstrap. The women tried to do the same and failed. 75. HARE TRIES TO IMITATE WOODPECKER Here lives my story. Hare went to.visit his friend Woodpecker. When he came to the door Woodpecker said, "Come in and sit down." There was a stump just outside the wigwam. "I have nothing to eat yet,"</page><page sequence="101">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 101 said Woodpecker, "but I'll go now and get our dinner." Then up the stump he went and began to dig worms out of the wood. "These," said he, "are eels for our dinner. I always get them this way." And when he had enough "eels" he cooked them and the two ate their dinner. Then Hare invited Woodpecker to come over to his house in the woods and have dinner with him. When Woodpecker arrived Hare said, "Now I'll go get our dinner. You sit down and wait." He took a piece of bone with a point to it and tied it to his forehead, like Wood- pecker's bill. Then he tried to climb up the tree as Woodpecker had done. He got up a little distance by dint of hard scrambling but his paws slipped and down he came flat on his back with a thud that drove his breath out. Up the tree he pawed his way again. This time he got further and tried to dig worms, "eels," out of the wood with his bone as his guest had done. But he lost his hold and fell all the way down and got killed. When Woodpecker saw what had happened he came out and jumped over the dead rabbit twice and the second time Hare came to life. "Now you go lie down. You are sick. You can't do anything now. You go lie down and I'll get the dinner," said Woodpecker to him. And he went up the stump, got the "eels," cooked them, and they had their dinner. 76. HARE TRIES TO IMITATE KINGFISHER Here camps my story. Hare was going along on his way when he saw smoke coming from the roof of an old camp. When he got close to the door he rapped and Kingfisher came. Kingfisher said, "Come in, niddbe, and sit down." So it was done. Then Hare sat down and Kingfisher went down to the shore by the river. Hare watched him. Out on a cedar leaning over the water went Kingfisher and looked down. Pretty soon he jumped into the water headfirst and then got to shore and hauled out a big long fish. He cleaned it, cooked it and then with Hare ate it up. After eating they spent a while telling stories. Then Hare started homeward and told Kingfisher to come and see him. When he arrived home he built a camp and at about the same time his partner Kingfisher came. Hare told him to sit down. Pretty soon they got settled down. Then Hare got a sharp bone and fastened it to his forehead. His camp was near the river. Then he went out on a tree and jumped right into the water. He did not see anything. He had a hard time. He drowned. Then Kingfisher got him ashore and laid him out. Then he stretched him out flat and jumped over him and Hare awoke. "Sp---!! Sp- -!!" he spat out, "I got fish that time! Sp- -!! Sp---!! Sp- -!!" he spat out. Then Kingfisher said to him, "You sit still. I'll get dinner." And he went out and caught some fish and they had dinner.</page><page sequence="102">102 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. 77. VARIANT Now Hare went visiting again. He saw Kingfisher sitting before his wigwam on a branch overhanging the water. Whenever a fish went by Kingfisher would dive in on him and spear him with his beak. When he had enough he invited Hare in to dinner. After they had eaten, Hare wanted to get some fish as Kingfisher had done. He went out on the branch and when he saw a fish he dove in to get it. But he couldn't get out and nearly drowned before Kingfisher could get him out. Then he went on. 78. HARE KILLS THE YOUNG FISHERS AND IS PURSUED Next Hare came upon an old mother Fisher (paga'mke, black cat), and her young ones. He took a poker stick from near the fire and knocked them all on the head until they were dead. Then he ran away into the thicket. When old Fisher came home and found his family all killed he struck Hare's trail and started after him. He chased him into a thicket and soon began to gain on Hare. When Hare saw that he was losing he turned himself into a priest striding up and down before a church reading his prayer book. When Fisher came along, he asked the priest, "Did you see a rabbit go by here?" The priest held up his hand for silence, not to interrupt him. In a few minutes he asked him the same question again. "Yes," said the priest, "there are a lot of hares around here. The swamp yonder is full of them." "Well," said Fisher, "I'm looking for the one who killed all my family." And he was going to start on. "Stop awhile before you go and have something to eat and drink," said the priest. And they went into the church. The priest gave Fisher some red liquid (wine) and some pieces of bread. "Put the pieces of bread inside your shirt," said he, "you'll soon need something to eat while you are chasing that hare." So Fisher tucked some chunks of bread inside his shirt. Now Fisher fell into a sound sleep from the red liquid and the church and priest disappeared, and left him in a snow bank. When he woke up, there he was almost frozen to death. But he started on. The church had disappeared and the priest had changed back into Hare and had run off. As soon as Fisher began to get hungry following hare tracks in the swamp he sat down to eat the bread the priest had given him. He put his hand inside his shirt for the bread but only pulled out a handful of hare excrement. Then he knew he had been fooled and ever since then the fisher has been chasing down and killing hares. There it ends. 79. HARE ESCAPES FROM LYNX AFTER KILLING HIS FAMILY Hare started off again and had gone a little way when he saw another camp. He thought he would stop and have something to eat, as he had travelled so long. Then he saw in the camp one old and two young creatures. These were lynxes. He took a club and knocked them all on</page><page sequence="103">Penobscot Tales and Relzgious Beliefs. I 03 the head, then departed. When the old lynx came home he saw Hare's track and knew by that who had killed his folks. He started off on the trail until he came to a church with a priest walking before it preaching. Lynx asked the priest if he had seen Hare. "Yes," said the priest, "a lot of them in the swamp." Then the priest invited the lynx inside to have something to eat and drink. Lynx went in and the priest got him drunk. He gave Lynx some crackers which he put inside his shirt lest he get hungry. And soon Lynx fell asleep. When he awoke he found himself frozen in the ice and when he looked in his shirt for the crackers he found only hare droppings there. That priest was Hare himself and he had fooled him. Then Lynx sped on again through the swamp follow- ing hare tracks. Soon he saw some teamsters hauling wood, and he said, "Where is Hare?" And the teamsters sent him chasing off toward salt water (the ocean). Lynx chased Hare until he came to the salt water. There he saw a big ship floating and those on board fired at him. Then I left and went away. So that's why Lynx is always chasing about hunting and killing hares nowadays. 80o. HARE DECEIVES WILDCAT BY GIVING HIM PILLS AND WINE Frog and Hare were living together. Hare said to Frog, "What would you do if an enemy came along?" Frog, showing his skill in magic and deception, hopped around and crawled out of sight in some rotten wood. Hare laughed very hard. "I'll show you what I can do!" He jumped up and ran out into his "yard."' Then Wildcat came along and as he went by Hare hit him with an axe and split his head open. Then Wildcat gave chase. Hare turned himself into a doctor. When Wildcat came up he asked the doctor if he had seen a hare. And Hare disguised as a doctor answered that he had seen the bog full of hare tracks. "No," said Wildcat, "a certain one only I want." Hare took him into a fine house that he caused to appear and gave him some pills to take for medicine which were in reality pellets of hare dung. And he gave Wildcat a cup of wine to drink which was in reality only a pitcher-plant full of urine. This draught and medicine put Wildcat to sleep and when he woke up he found himself cold and wet lying in the middle of a big bog.2 1 awas-endidi., animal enclosure, the beaten track in the snow in a sheltered part of the swamp where the animals spend the severe weather in winter when the snow is too deep for them to range for food. This is the "yard," familiar to hunters in the north. 2 The adventures of Hare also include the story of the race between Hare and Turtle, which although of European origin is recited in the Indian language among these tribes. The elements of the story are the same as in the European fable, the Hare falling asleep on the way and the Turtle winning.</page><page sequence="104">104 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. 8I. WHY BIRDS' LIVERS ARE SPLIT Once long ago a party of hunters got a quantity of birds. They cut out their livers and saved them up to get enough for a feast on livers. In those days birds' livers were in one solid piece. One of these hunters was very fond of livers. Every night he would secretly eat some. He would slit the livers up and cut a slice off each so that they might not miss it. When the Master1 at last discovered the livers all split he declared that it was new to him. "I have never known birds' livers to be split like that, but since they are so, let them remain so." And so they are nowadays. 82. THE PORCUPINE AND THE FISHER The porcupine had his home in a hole in a rocky ledge. For his door he had a big stone that he could roll aside when he wanted to, though I don't know just how he did it. One day he was sitting outside the door when he saw the fisher coming up the hill to visit him. He ran inside and rolled his rock door closed in the fisher's face. "Kwe! Porcupine!" cried the fisher, "I have come to visit you. Let me in and we will have dinner together." But the porcupine would not open his door. He told the fisher he did not want company that day and told him that he belonged outside and there he would stay. Then the fisher got angry and tried to push aside the door, but couldn't move it. Then he began to mock him. "Ee! you dirty porcupine in there, sitting on your buttocks amongst your urine and excrements. You dirty porcupine! Let me come in and I'll fix you!" So he kept on mocking the porcupine, telling him all the time to open the door. But the porcupine stayed inside quietly. Soon the fisher began to run and bump himself against the stone door, when suddenly the porcupine opened it just a little and turned his back toward the opening. The fisher jumped right onto his back but the porcupine's quills all stuck into him and he turned and ran off down the mountain and never bothered the porcupine after that. 83. THE FOX AND THE HERON VISIT The fox and the heron were very friendly. The fox asked the heron to come and visit him. One day he went and arrived at the fox's den. The fox got ready and cooked dinner. He spread the food on a piece of birch bark and started to eat, but the heron could not manage to lick up any of the soft food with his long beak. The fox said, "See how I do it." He could lick it up easily but the heron could not eat. So the heron said, "Come over and see me." And the fox went over one day. The 1 By the master, Glusk be may be meant. Or it may have been merely the master of the hunting party. The narrator did not know, he was a Malecite adopted by the Penobscot.</page><page sequence="105">Penobscot Tales and Relzigous Beliefs. 105 heron cooked dinner and put the food in a long, deep birch-bark thing, a kind of bottle, and said, "Come on, eat !" But the fox could not reach it and the heron could. So he ate it all, and the fox went away disappointed. 84. FROG OBTAINS HIS GRANDFATHER'S MEMBER Frog wanted to get a wife, but none of the girls would have him because he had no penis. So he went to see his grandmother and told her the trouble. He asked the old woman to do something for him. She got down and got an old birch-bark vessel from underneath her bed of boughs. She took an old piece of dried something out of it and said, "Stand in front of me and spread your legs apart." Then she stuck the old thing on him and said, "Your grandfather's penis!" When Frog looked at himself he saw that he had a fine large member. "Now," said his grandmother, "you will get plenty of wives." Then Frog went off to the prettiest girl's wigwam. On purpose he stumbled as he entered just when she looked, and fell down so as to expose his member. The girl then wanted to marry him, and all the other women were after him too. There I lived with them and there the story ends. 85. PANTHER LOSES HIS MEMBER Panther was going along by the river. On the opposite shore he saw some good looking women washing and pounding their clothes on the stones on the beach. He desired to copulate with them. So he took off his penis and fixed it upon the end of a stick and pushed the stick under water across the stream. But before he got it across a chub swimming by took and swallowed the bait. Thereupon Panther got a canoe and fish spear and went spearing fish to recover his member. Said he to his friend who handled the spear in the bow, "When you see the fish, be sure and strike just so, on the head." When they came up to the fish Panther's friend struck the fish but missed his head and hit him in the middle. Panther rejoiced to recover his member but when he put it on again he got it on upside down and thus it has remained upon the panther family until now. I left then! 86. BEAVER AND MUSKRAT CHANGE TAILS Beaver used to have a long thin tail, the one Muskrat has now, and Muskrat had the broad flat one. Beaver thought that Muskrat's tail would be better suited to him and his own to Muskrat. So he said to Muskrat, "Your tail is too large for you. See how much better mine would be for a creature of your size. Yours is too big and flat. If you had mine you could swim much easier. Let us change for a trial." So they changed tails, and Beaver liked his new tail very much. He could dive with it. So he at once made off with it. But Muskrat, they say,</page><page sequence="106">0o6 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. tried to recover his own, and went after Beaver. When Beaver saw him coming he dove out of sight and since then each has had to keep what he got. That is why, it is said, Muskrat is always going about making his complaining noise.' Joe Hemlock adds to this tale that Beaver had a snake for a witness to the exchange and Muskrat, a frog. When Beaver got the tail he splashed water on the frog, frightened him, and both dived into the water. But Muskrat did nothing to frighten his witness, the snake. So the latter sat with his head raised from the water straight up waiting for the affair to end. Hence today when the Indians pass by a pond and see the snake's head sticking up out of the water, no matter how long it may be, and the frog dive down at the first sign of alarm, they refer to the story. 87. HARE RESCUES HIS FRIEND AND LOSES HIS TAIL2 Hare had a partner. Once he told him, "Whenever you are in trouble and want help just think of me and I will come to your aid." It was not long before his friend fell into a deep ditch filled with water,3 and he could not get out. He thought he was going to die, but just then remembered what Hare had told him. So he thought of him and behold: Hare was there. At first he tried to pull his friend out but found that he could not reach down far enough. So he said, "I will let my tail down and you catch hold so I can pull you up." Then he let his tail down into the hole and his friend caught hold. Then Hare began pulling but could not draw him up. He pulled so hard that his tail broke off short. Then he tried another way. He said to his friend, "I will hang over the edge and let my hind legs down. Catch hold of them and I will draw you up." So Hare let himself down backwards into the hole and his friend caught him about the waist with his arms, and Hare began to pull. He pulled so hard that he stretched his waist, but he got his friend up. That is why Hare now has only a stump of a tail and such a long hinder part of his body. Anyway that's the story they tell. Then I left. 88. THE DEVIL, IS CHEATED An old man lived with his wife in the woods. One day he was going along hauling wood on his back when he met the devil. The devil promised him a team of horses if one year from that day he would come back and allow the devil to cut out his privates in payment. 1 This refers to the peculiar call of the muskrat which when imitated by hunters enables them to lure him within shooting range. 2 For a Passamaquoddy version, see Leland, p. 223. 3 Some thought this was a well.</page><page sequence="107">Penobscot Tales and Religious Beliefs. 107 Everything went along well for a year until the day came for him to go back to the place where he met the devil and pay his debt. That morning his old woman could not get him up, he was crying so much and was so frightened. By and by, she asked him what was wrong and after a while he told her of his bargain. "Never mind," said she, "I know a way to fool the devil. Give me your clothes and let me go in your place. He will not know the difference." So the old man now felt better. He got up, and dressed his wife in his trousers and coat and went back to bed, letting her go in his place. When she met the devil she made believe that she was very much amused. She told him that she had come to pay her debt as arranged. "All right," said he, "take off your trousers and I will take my dues." When she was ready she said, "Ah ha, you see I have fooled you. I was afraid you would cut too deep so I cut them off myself." The devil saw the scar and said, "Well, you have fooled me but I am even with you anyway. So go along, I have my pay." 89. HARE FAILS TO GET SQUIRREL'S TAIL Hare saw what a fine tail Squirrel had and asked him to come down and exchange with him. But Squirrel refused because he said he needed it to steer him in leaping among the branches. "What good would that stump of a tail you have do me up here ?" said he. As Squirrel would not exchange, each kept his own.</page></plain_text>
