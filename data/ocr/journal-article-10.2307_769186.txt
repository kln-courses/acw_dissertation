<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 1854-1941 IN the seventies of the last century the Origin of Species was beginning to influence humanist studies. The 'Old Stone Age' was an established fact; Huxley's Man's Place in Nature was a matter of discussion along with Darwin's Descent of Man. The challenge to dogma was seen to be not merely to such outer ramparts as the notion of creation by fiat in six days, but to what had been strongholds of belief. The changes of thought affected particularly the many distinguished young minds nurtured on The Shorter Catechism of the Church of Scotland, and its various, usually weaker, auxiliaries. Frazer, born on I January 1854, at Glasgow, was brought up by pious and highly intelligent parents in their home of comfortable circum- stances at Helensburgh. The beauty of the Gareloch and the dignity and affection of home life remained among Frazer's treasured memories, touchingly expressed in some of his verse. Here, therefore, was no question of embitterment or rebellion, but rather a single-minded search for truth, not without a hope of reconciling the older and the newer thought. What had seemed to be firm rock-foundation was being found to be erratics in the moraines of folklore. Frazer was to show that, while some features-such as a discrimination between the permissible and the reprehensible-were in a measure universal, the anthropomorphic fancies of early thought were crude and provisional interpretations that must be recognized as provisional even in their later and more subtle sublimations. Unlike Darwin, Frazer was able to enjoy the ordinary schemes of education of his time. He went first to Springfield Academy, Helensburgh, and then to Alexander Mackenzie at the Larchfield Academy. Next, from 1869 to 1874, he studied the humanities 897</page><page sequence="2">i;tk ;Icc Cy-z-,~ ci 4~'</page><page sequence="3">898 OBITUARY NOTICES under G. G. Ramsay at Glasgow, also following Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) in his difficult discourses on Natural Philosophy, as well as lectures on Rhetoric and Philo- sophy. He thus equipped himself upon the old foundation of general scholarship for his future task as a leader in the new age of specialism, and this helped him to realize that no specialism could be a self-determining realm. Frazer's father, afraid of Oxford's High Church tendencies at the time, sent his son to Cambridge. However interestingly one may speculate on possible reactions between Frazer and the Oxford of Tylor, Vinogradoff and Rhys, it was for the good of scholarship that he went to Cambridge, and that for a particular reason. He was followed there, some years later, by the dis- possessed minister and professor ofAberdeen-William Robertson Smith, one of the pioneers of the study of comparative religion. Smith had a most powerful influence upon his young friend, and it was to him that Frazer dedicated the first edition of The Golden Bough. Ramsay at Glasgow had helped Frazer to become an eager classical scholar and to develop that remarkable power of beautiful expression which is the greater delight to his readers because it was so evidently a delight to the author himself. But, for all his love of a sonorous phrase and a delicate description, he rarely allowed his literary power to lead him astray. Nearly twenty-five years after he left Glasgow, Frazer dedicated to Ramsay his six volumes of text, translation, and commentary of Pausanias's Description of Greece. Ramsay well said that this was the greatest honour of his life. Cambridge, at first, seems to have encouraged the young scholar to study classical philosophy, and the influence of the personality of Henry Jackson is seen in the essay on The Growth of Plato's Ideal Theory, written in connexion with his election to a fellowship at Trinity College in 1879. With three renewals this fellowship was continued to Frazer's death in 1941, a record rarely matched. The essay was published in 1930; the manuscript is preserved in the Bodleian Library. Frazer was admitted to the</page><page sequence="4">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 899 Middle Temple in 1881, and some detect his legal training in his copious citations and cumulative arguments. From this time onwards Frazer occupied himself with study and writing, making notes with enormous assiduity on a vast scale. His power of annotation and classification led, in due course, to the production of great books in bewilderingly rapid succession, all full of minute references. He accepted a chair of social anthropology at the University of Liverpool (1907), but did not feel drawn to the work of teaching and organizing, and soon resigned; he felt his place was in a great library among masses of books, as he says in one of his verses:- Still, still I con old pages And through great volumes wade While life's brief summer passes And youth's brief roses fade. He was one of the original Fellows of the British Academy, was knighted in 1914, and made a member of the Order of Merit in 1924. He was elected to this society in 192o under the statute governing special elections on grounds of 'conspicuous service to the cause of science'. A signal compliment was paid to him, as a British scholar, when he was made an associate member of the Institut de France and a Commander of the Legion of Honour. Societies, academies and universities of many countries vied with one another in honouring him, and his books were translated into several languages. All these honours were so fitting as, apparently, to make no difference whatever to the quiet retiring scholar. But they show that his influence, exerted primarily among the learned, had been powerful enough to reach a wide public that, sometimes, had had little opportunity of formal education. I well remember The Golden Bough as the treasured and much studied possession of a miner in South Wales. It is probable that Frazer's has been the deepest scientific influence upon religious thought since Darwin's. French scholars admired Frazer, and he was, at times, compared or contrasted</page><page sequence="5">900 OBITUARY NOTICES with Renan, in whose work he was himself much interested. Both were sincerely affectionate towards their old homes and the beliefs they had outgrown; both sought a new harmony of truth and ethical ideals; both were masters of language and of poetic vision. But Frazer was the patient searcher into endless documents, scrupulously careful, methodical to a fault; indeed he was wont to describe himself unaffectedly, if inadequately, as dull. He went his way, disregarded abuse, and disdained the attacks of prejudice; he could follow the advice of Marcus Aurelius and retire into his own soul and be at rest and free from all business. Renan's impulsive creation of a word-picture is often in- adequate in drawing because the artist has his mind on the colour effects that are a delight to his readers. Many who acknowledge their debt to Renan nevertheless know how much more far reaching is Frazer's influence upon the thought of mankind. Frazer's dedications of his works to Robertson Smith and to Ramsay are further interesting indications of a generous spirit anxious to acknowledge, to conserve, and to build rather than to forget or destroy old associations. Frazer began to express himself through studies of the classics. His Growth of Plato's Ideal Theory, above mentioned, was followed by an edition of Sallust's Catilina et Jugurtha (1884). He found that, for many scholars of that time, Greek and Roman civilizations were features accepted as such with comparatively little thought concerning their origins, though Fustel de Cou- langes was throwing light upon those problems, and Schliemann's influence was beginning to tell. Not a few, however, still dis- missed the idea of history behind Homer with as much hurry and contempt as others showed towards what were considered irreverent attempts to analyse the early chapters of Genesis. Frazer's steadfast search for truth, his classical training, his philosophical studies under Veitch and Jackson, still more his friendship with Robertson Smith, helped him towards a vision of the long evolution of classical and Hebrew thought and religion. Like Maine in Law, and Schrader in Philology, Robertson Smith</page><page sequence="6">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 901 and he applied the comparative method to the study of religion, and, in so doing, became the followers of Tylor. They cultivated the field of documentary evidence, and Frazer supplemented this by geographical observation in classical lands, while Smith travelled in Semitic regions. But they left the work of excavation to Lartet, Schliemann, Evans and their followers, and the task of direct observation of lowly peoples to their contemporary- Haddon. It is a matter of legitimate British pride that, in the record of nineteenth-century progress in the scientific study of man's works and ways, the names of Darwin, Huxley, Tylor, Robertson Smith, Arthur Evans, Alfred Haddon and James George Frazer stand out so prominently, and that their relations with one another were marked by high regard and often by personal devotion. Behind the documentary researches of Smith and Frazer lay generations of disciplined experience, important however new the use to which it was to be put. Behind Schliemann and Evans lay a chaotic muddle only gradually cleared up as the compara- tive method developed in that field. The result has been that Frazer's work was nearly done before solid results of prehistoric studies were made available for such workers as he. In reading Frazer one cannot but wish that he were still among us to weave into his rich tapestry the conclusions of the prehistoric archaeologists. While Frazer was preparing himself for the great task that seems to have been shaping itself in his mind, he was, naturally, drawn into the writing of articles to help Robertson Smith, who had become editor of the famous ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Two important ones dealt with Taboo and with Totemism. It is interesting to find, in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute for 1885, a paper by Frazer on certain burial customs, described as an illustration of The Primitive Theory of the Soul. 'Dr E. B. Tylor', in the discussion, congratu- lated 'Mr Frazer' on the results of his study of the classics. In the Encyclopaedia article on Taboo, though traces were noted for Malaysia, North America, ancient Israel, and the 57</page><page sequence="7">902 OBITUARY NOTICES Aegean, it was considered as, mainly, a Polynesian feature. Its almost universal occurrence, under various guises, was not emphasized as it came to be later on in Frazer's work. In the ancient Aegean some held the pig to be sacred, others considered it unclean. Frazer argued that the ideas of the sacred and accursed, clean and unclean, arose by differentiation from the idea of taboo. One may note here the contradictory usages of the word sacre in French. Frazer has a characteristic sentence about this differentiation-'Thus on the Taboo were grafted the golden fruits of law and morality, while the parent stem dwindled slowly into the sour crabs and empty husks of popular super- stition, on which the swine of modem society are still content to feed'. Needless to add, 'swine' is here used by him without any touch of unkindness. This sentence brings out Frazer's general principle that, from beginnings which seem to us fantastic, often rational arguments from inadequate premises, men might proceed by gradual correction and integration of inferences to build up schemes with a far larger measure of truth. To trace back a belief or practice to beginnings which now seem absurd might, Frazer thought, dispose of claims to what are called preternatural origins, but need not destroy social and ethical value. In the above quotation, as often elsewhere, we see Frazer allowing value-judgments to penetrate into his work. We also glimpse his, then, strong belief in human progress. Later he became less clear on this subject, for he was wont to say that the change from magic to religion seemed to be followed by the change from religion to science; and it was possible that further steps might lead from science to extinction. At this stage he was already on the lookout for detailed resemblances. Men under strict taboo in Polynesia must not touch their food with their hands. In early Israel the heavy taboo of the Nazarite might be broken if the priest shaved his head at the door of the sanctuary and put food into his hands. Frazer also notes the point made by Plato that, during a campaign, Homer's warriors never ate fish. Writing in the eighties of last century, he did not add that those warriors,</page><page sequence="8">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 903 steeped in east-central European and Balkan pastoral tradition, probably despised fish-eating as fit only for the conquered peoples of the Aegean shores. The worshippers of the Syrian goddess, says Frazer in the article on Totemism, thought ulcers would break out over their bodies if they ate an anchovy or a sprat. He did not think, at the time, that there was any satisfactory interpretation of the origins of totemism; and he emphasized the scantiness of literature discussing the subject, apart from original observations, since scientific interest was first aroused by J. F. McLennan twenty years earlier. He pays a very warm tribute to McLennan's insight. Thanks in no small measure to Frazer's own work, no one would speak of scantiness of dis- cussions of totemism in the subsequent half-century. One notes, however, that, in our own day, there is less disposition to treat this, or anything else, as a general phenomenon; students are now more imbued with the geographical point of view and prefer to study a community in its environment. The danger of treating features of widely different communities as though they were parallel is more apparent than it was; similarity, even coincidence, need not mean homology, unless the resemblance extends to a good deal of detail. Frazer held at this period that totemism was certain for the ancient Egyptians, and probable for early Semites, Greeks and Romans; and a further sentence gives an idea of difficulties under which such investigations were then made. The speculations that Max Miiller propagated in England are writ large over the following quotation:- 'If (totemism is) proved for one Aryan people, it might be regarded as proved for all; since totemism could scarcely have been developed by any one Aryan branch after the dispersion, and there is no evidence or probability that it was ever borrowed.' Modern prehistoric studies have so altered our perspective as to make that quotation an echo from a dead world. Just as in the matter of taboo, so, in discussing totemism, Frazer contrasts the social and the religious aspects, and empha-</page><page sequence="9">904 OBITUARY NOTICES sizes the tendency for them to part company as they evolve. Here, again, the change is from argument upon coincidence and other weak premises to a more integrated idea, with, as before, the withering of the original stock and the grafting of its later shoots into other stems of perhaps diverse origin and direction. These Encyclopaedia articles show that the stage was set for the production of The Golden Bough (1890, 2 volumes), the introduction to which gives us, in his own words, Frazer's point of departure-'Compared with the evidence afforded by living tradition, the testimony of ancient books on the subject of early religion is worth very little. For literature accelerates the advance of thought at a rate which leaves the slow progress of opinion by word of mouth at an immeasurable distance behind. Two or three generations of literature may do more to change thought: than two or three thousand years of traditional life.' Frazer, therefore, set out to collate data from observers the world over. Opening The Golden Bough at random we find, on the couple of pages exposed, references to Scotland, Styria, Lorraine, India and Phrygia. On another couple of pages are instances from Australian natives, Philippine islanders, Annam, Pelew Islands, Assam, Sumatra and ancient Rome. On a third pair are notes about the Congo, India, the East Indies, Samoa, North America and Austria. It is worth noting that, while this third set is rather miscellaneous, the first one has a regional relationship to the north-west quadrant of the Old World,. which is also closely linked with India; while the second one has. its special relations with eastern Asia. Frazer was quite conscious. of broad regional diversities, though he did not build on a regional framework. His Anthologia Anthropologica (1938-1939) indicates his appreciation of the regional point of view. He has been thought to be a believer in the parallelism of social and religious evolution of all or most peoples in response to elemental needs and desires such as rain, sunshine, fertility, luck. Those are very widespread aims of social ritual, but Frazer was not primarily concerned either with doctrines of independent evolution in different regions or with theories of diffusion of</page><page sequence="10">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 905 culture. As a wise follower of Tylor he accepted the possibility of both as natural processes. He was little interested in the con- troversies that grew up in the first quarter of this century with the claim that the idea of diffusion of culture was a new doctrine, a claim linked with exaggerations concerning Egyptian origins of civilization. Here and there, it is true, Frazer did seem to adhere to a doctrine of more or less uniform development the world over, as when he spoke of the primitive theory of the soul (1885). But, even at this early stage, he was fully aware of the immense variety of human fancies. To bar the return of the ghost might be a dominant feature of ritual in some circumstances; to secure rebirth of the revered and beloved dead might be a leading motive in others. (See Journal of the Anthropological Institute, 1885, page Ioi.) It is a little strange that Frazer did not develop at any great length in the original Golden Bough, as a separate theme, the idea of rebirth and transmigration of souls, though he has a wise remark on the subject: 'To suppose that the theories of animism and transmigration current among rude peoples of Asia are derived from Buddhism is to reverse the facts. Buddhism in this respect borrowed from savagery, not savagery from Buddhism'. Tylor had already emphasized widespread ideas of :rebirth, held by some non-literate peoples to be proved by likeness of children to their forbears; and he noted that rebirth was supposed to occur frequently in other than human form. He had, further, argued for the growth of the great religions of India from these crude beginnings. Frazer, however, was quite clear on the subject of the early idea of the soul as a power within the body, but not of it, which was somehow the cause of the person's actions. This idea, retained in more or less scientific circles until the seventeenth century, is still not quite dead. In developing conclusions from his arguments about the -origins of the idea of the soul, Frazer found himself in opposition to some theological thought; and his work and opinions have</page><page sequence="11">906 OBITUARY NOTICES had a far-reaching influence upon the discussion of the matter among many who may not have read a line that he wrote. That all this should grow upon The Golden Bough is a very important fact, and a recognition of the need to distinguish between acceptance of Frazer's detailed theories on various matters and the appreciation of his standpoint as an evolutionist. He was always ready to change a detailed theory; he remained a convinced philosophical evolutionist. To him, as to Darwin, and one might say to others before them, there was one great stream of energy-changes running through time, and to bring in outside powers to explain these changes was 'to blunt William of Occam's razor'. Not being a biologist, perhaps Frazer did not see so clearly as Darwin that all these energy-changes we call evolution are, so far as living things are concerned, reactions of organism and local environment to one another. It is the deeper appreciation of that idea which has grown of late years in anthropological and other studies. The Golden Bough in the sacred grove at Nemi, in a green hollow of the Alban Hills, was of old guarded by a priest with drawn sword, peering into the darkness of the wood for a challenger, who must be a runaway slave. The challenger would pluck a sprig of the mistletoe bough, and challenge the priest to mortal combat. If the priest was losing his vigour, sooner or later a combat would go against him, and the challenger would reign in his stead, as the centre of a cult of fertility, gathered around the temple of Diana portrayed in Turner's imaginative picture. Frazer felt that this grim scheme of priestly succession through mortal combat must be a survival from a savage past into the days of classical society. He, therefore, hunted through books of travel and studies of folk custom of almost all parts of the world to find traces of analogous, perhaps sometimes also homologous, ideas of sympathetic magic, that is of the influence of the priest's vigour upon fertility of crops, animals, and families among the worshippers. His harvest was a rich and varied one, and included instances of many kinds of fertility ritual, as well as multifarious</page><page sequence="12">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 907 symbolism. Sometimes his argument suffered from the need for taking particular details out of their local context; study has made us increasingly conscious that the whole is other than the sum of its parts. We have also to recognize the danger of arguing too much from supposed parallelisms of belief. One people, depending on vigorous and dangerous adventure, may weave a wildly patterned robe of custom. Another, whose situation is one of delicate balance and careful routine, may condemn, though not always eschew, bacchanalian extravagances. Der- vishes and Confucians have strikingly contrasted modes of life. Another omnipresent difficulty is that neither we, ourselves, nor any other peoples anywhere, act at all regularly or consistently upon our supposed beliefs. They may influence us occasionally and in certain moods. Apart from this a few taboos may have power. But a correlated scheme of belief and action is non- existent. The Golden Bough was given a second edition in 19oo, and, meanwhile, Frazer was continuing his studies of Totemism far beyond the point at which he left them in the Encyclopaedia article of I887.,The four large volumes of Totemism and Exogamy appeared in 19Io, and students may find and enjoy a vigorous but generously respectful attack on Frazer's views on the subject by Andrew Lang in some subsequent editions of the Encyclopaedia: Britannica. Neither Frazer's nor Lang's article on Totemism survives in the last edition. Frazer's standpoint (19Io) is that resemblances between certain beliefs and practices among peoples of Australia, the Pacific, Africa and North America are so many and so close that they deserve to be classed under the one name of Totemism-the notion of an intimate relation between a group of kindred people on the one side and a species of natural or artificial, living or non-living objects on the other. Each kind of object, in this relation, may be called a Totem, the word being borrowed from the Ojibway language (North America). Characteristically he adds that what we may say of the totemic system of one tribe may not apply without serious modification and restriction to</page><page sequence="13">908 OBITUARY NOTICES the totemic system of another. Equally characteristic is his statement that he had been wrong, in some earlier writings, in allowing that totemism might be a form of religion; he found that the totem is never really worshipped. He further discusses several theories, including some of his own which he had dis- carded, and then states the idea of Conceptional Totemism to which he had come in the course of his studies. It depended to some extent upon the idea that the Arunta of Central Australia and the Banks Islanders (in the New Hebrides) retain a primitive form of totemism. These peoples have been said to believe that a woman becomes pregnant through the entry into her of some spirit associated with a visible object, which will, for that reason, be taboo to the child she will bear, and will be its totem. The totem would thus be individual in origin, not hereditary. Frazer emphasized that totems became hereditary according to rules established for each society, and so a totemic society contains a number of totem clans with a basis of physical relationship in most cases, but often complicated by convention and growth of custom. Frazer, noting this, argued that the exogamy of totem clans must have been evolved to prevent the marriage of close relations, and thought the totems had become hereditary in connexion with this scheme of marriage out of the kin. Rivers became clear that the Banks islanders, in his time at any rate, understood the relation of the male to the procreation of children, and much doubt has been thrown on the view that the Arunta are ignorant of that relation. One must not assume that statements of Arunta and Banks islanders and other women about entry of spirits into them necessarily imply ignorance of the importance of the part played by their mates; and it should be noted that these peoples, like almost all others, have rules to prevent marriage of close relatives. They may really hold that the action of the male is a partial, but not a complete cause, preparatory rather than final. Most peoples, even, it is said, the Arunta, but, according to Malinowski, not the Trobriand islanders, know that among animals the action of the male is habitually followed by preg-</page><page sequence="14">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 909 nancy and made obvious by the swelling of the female's body and milk-glands. The analogy from animal to human facts can hardly have been missed, and, apparently, even the Trobriand islanders understand that a virgin cannot bear offspring. In the case of our own race, however, far more than in that of animals, there may be many matings before the desired result is attained. This fact, no doubt, hindered the full appreciation of the facts of sex and permitted the maintenance for a while of the idea of a spirit entering into the mother's body when she first recog- nized her pregnancy, or at the moment of 'quickening' of the baby within her. Frazer's view that exogamy developed, after totems had become hereditary, as a means of preventing inbreeding, was weakened by his feeling that the 16wly peoples could not argue out the frequent connexion between inbreeding and deficiency. But there are cases in which that connexion is clearly realized, and it is highly probable that exogamy is related to this realization in several instances. Thoughts here and there in Darwin's writings, followed by statements from Andrew Lang and from Freud, have suggested an alternative theory. They visualized the early human male as possessing several mates. As his sons grew up, they might inter- fere with his women; and his jealousy is supposed to have forced the youths to get mates from other groups by capture, or by simulated capture when some kind of accord had been made. The totem on this view would be in effect a group nickname; the bandying of nicknames is a world-wide fact. The large a priori element in this theory is a very weak point. It may be useful to attempt to sum up, in relation to Frazer's views, a modern standpoint on this subject:-- (I) With Frazer, Malinowski and others, many students think that early man had an inadequate idea of the influence of the male on procreation, but it is likely that all recognize and have long recognized that his action is at least preparatory. (2) The notion of rebirth is very ancient and very widespread.</page><page sequence="15">910 OBITUARY NOTICES Accompanying it is naturally the idea of the entry of a spirit into the prospective mother. (3) The spirits concerned are naturally supposed to have an abode while they wait. This may be some kind of animal or plant or inanimate object. To such objects the name totem is still applied, but with some reserve because of increased realization of social diversities so abundantly evidenced by Frazer. (4) Combinations of these ideas at various stages of develop- ment help the growth of a variety of beliefs. Some peoples think a human being may be reborn in non- human form; this is an easily understood line of argu- ment for people who believe in a spirit-abode whether it be definable as a totem or not. Others who have more or less attained to a knowledge of sex have re- tained, or developed, fancies of, at any rate occasional, virgin-birth. (5) Many peoples living in small groups have, to some extent, realized that inbreeding has its dangers. Also, they have appreciated the value of some measure of sexual peace in the household. Accompanying this there develop rules of marriage. The totem becomes hereditary in one or other line, and the totem clans become exogamous. Naturally, fanciful ideas complicate matters sufficiently to make it still possible that near-kin may marry, but some peoples actually have additional rules to prevent this. (6) Peoples realizing, to some extent, the part of the male have sometimes attached importance to the totem of the father as the source of the spirit which is to enter the prospective mother. From this, custom leads on to the incorporation of the wife in her husband's ritual group, and of her eschewing contacts with the ritual group of her father lest the spirit entering into her should not be congruous with what her husband gives her.</page><page sequence="16">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 9 I (7) Whether as a development from, or as an alternative to, the idea of the totem, there grew the idea of an abode of the dead as a home of spirits awaiting rebirth in some recognized way. Unwanted spirits, such as those of people who have been eaten by tigers in India, are sometimes located by burial away from the sacred cemetery of the group. The question of totems and their origin and meaning, however, cannot be said to be settled. It may be that Frazer went rather far in treating as almost homologous the relevant beliefs and practices of many peoples from widely different areas. Statements by travellers, even answers given by natives to their questions, are often open to doubt. Linguistic difficulties are notorious. The desire to give a pleasant answer and the mischievous in- tention to mislead have both to be allowed for. There is, never- theless, no doubt that exogamy is a widespread and ancient feature of humanity, and that Frazer's survey will remain of great value for its data, however theory may be adjusted as understanding grows. Frazer gave up the idea he had earlier adopted from Robertson Smith, namely, that totemism existed among the early Semites. He also thought it virtually unknown among peoples of Aryan and Turanian languages. Frazer's diligence in accumulating notes was, meanwhile, leading to the famous expansion of The Golden Bough, which, in its early form, had gone through two editions (189o and 19oo). During the years 1911 to 1915 the work expanded into twelve volumes, as follows: The Magic Art (2 volumes); Taboo and the Perils of the Soul; The Dying God; Adonis, Attis, Osiris (2 volumes; previously published as a separate work in 19o6, with a second edition in 1907); Spirits of the Corn and the Wild (2 volumes); The Scapegoat; Balder the Beautiful, a study of the Fire Festivals of Europe and the External Soul (2 volumes); and finally a volume of bibliography with a much-needed general index. The Golden Bough had become a survey, wider than ever, of man's early beliefs and rituals, but it was still deeply influenced in its scope</page><page sequence="17">912 OBITUARY NOTICES and arrangement by the circumstances and practices around the Golden Bough at Nemi; it did not claim to be a general study of the evolution of belief and ritual for mankind as a whole. The general position taken up was that man began with magic, thinking that by ceremonies and incantations he could control the course of nature, and finding later that what he had taken for causes were no causes. He, thereupon, took up the belief that there were other beings more powerful than he, and created gods who were anthropomorphs and who must be propitiated by prayer and sacrifice. Critics have suggested that, while this general sequence is undoubtedly true for the human race, Frazer's exposition has somewhat over-emphasized the differences be- tween the stages; one may well hesitate to assert that there is nothing of a religious nature among some of the lowly peoples who attach great importance to magical rites. It is the inevitable tendency of a good exposition of such a subject to achieve clearness by making statements a little more definite than the inconsistencies of the savage mind may fully justify. There seems little doubt that the vigour of the priest-king of the wood at Nemi was supposed to give vigour to crops and offspring to animals and families, and that the king was killed when his vigour declined; analogous rites have been noted for many peoples. Whether, however, Frazer was right in supposing that the savage realized fully the inevitableness of death has been disputed by Hartland, who emphasizes the ascription of death among many lowly peoples to evil magic. Probably Frazer and Hartland are both right in these matters; man's explanations vary with his moods. Spirits of the Corn and the Wild deals very specially with the 'Corn Maiden', the ceremonial gathered around the last sheaf or the best sheaf of the harvest. It may be questioned here whether 'Spirit' was quite the best word to use; but there is no difference of opinion about the general value of Frazer's survey. Adonis, Attis, Osiris personify the annual death and revival of plant life. With reference to The Scapegoat, again Frazer may have been inclined to bring a little too much under one and the same rubric. On Fire Festivals of Europe, Frazer</page><page sequence="18">JAMES GEORGE FRAZER 913 changed his opinion; at first he thought they were sympathetic magic to help the sun, later he held they were purificatory and protective against witchcraft. It is evident that, in this field of work, progress is best made by framing and discarding hypotheses, and Frazer was a most distinguished practician of that method. Theories were provisional, human beliefs were provisional, there were no immutable principles of right and wrong; this was of the very essence of his teaching. His little book called Psyche's Task adds another general feature of his doctrine, namely that, while superstition, which is false opinion, may have its evil sides, it has, nevertheless, had very great influence on mankind in promoting respect for authority and abstention from many forms of violence. Psyche is called upon to sort out true from false, and superstitions fade in consequence of that work; sometimes it may not be all gain from the point of view of accepted ethical standards. Mention must be made of Frazer's classical studies. In 1898 he issued in six volumes a translation and commentary on Pausanias's Description of Greece, a work which enlarged upon matters of antiquarian and folklore interest and thus fitted well into Frazer's general scheme. In 1930 he published an edition of Ovid's Fasti, again specially interesting to him because of its relations of folk-custom. Another of his interests is represented by his Folklore in the Old Testament in three volumes, issued in 19I18.While there has been no question as to the interesting and suggestive nature of this work, there has been some diversity of opinion as to the adequacy of treatment of some matters. It is a subject that might have been developed on as large a scale-as The Golden Bough, and this would have been attempted perhaps best by Robertson Smith had he not died in early middle life. Still another field of work, perhaps one might say of recreation, for Frazer was English Literature. His balanced mind loved the eighteenth century, and he published Sir Roger de Coverley: I. In the Temple, II. In Covent Garden, III. In Cambridge. He also wrote on Molire's Les Femmes Savantes, on Gibbon at Lausanne,</page><page sequence="19">914 OBITUARY NOTICES on William Cowper, and on many other topics, editing letters of Cowper, essays of Addison, and collections of passages from the Bible chosen for their literary beauty. He translated a few French works and wrote articles on subjects relating to that country, to which he was deeply attached. In 1921 there was founded the Frazer Lectureship on Social Anthropology in the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow and Liverpool, and this was made the occasion of an address to Frazer by A. E. Housman, specially printed. A bibliography of Frazer's writings to 1933 was compiled by Th. Besterman in honour of the eightieth birthday celebration, and was published by Messrs Macmillan. After that time Sir James continued to issue extracts from his notes under the titles: Aftermath, a supplement to the Golden Bough (1936); Totemica, a supplement to Totemism and Exogamy (1937); and Anthologia Anthropologica in four volumes (1938-39). A work on The Fear of the Dead in Primitive Religion, first published in one volume in 1933, was afterwards expanded and completed by a second and a third volume. He had previously published three volumes on The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead (1913, 1922 and 1924). In 1896 Frazer married Mrs Lily Grove, a lady of French birth, who thenceforth devoted her remarkable energy to the promotion of her husband's work and of its public recognition. They died, in old age, within a few hours of one another, completing in death a partnership which had meant so much to the world. Has there ever been such a record of patient and persistent collection of data all towards the same goal, with so little distraction of purpose, during sixty years ? H. J. FLEURE</page></plain_text>
