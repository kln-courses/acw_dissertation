<plain_text><page sequence="1">Atheism in Classical Antiquity. By A. B. DRACHMANN. Pp. x + 168. London : Gyldendal. 1922. 7s. 6d. This survey of religious scepticism in ancient times, by a Professor of Classical Philology in the University of Copenhagen, will be found useful and interesting both by students of ancient philosophy and by students of ancient religion, but is more particularly intended for the latter. Prof. Drachmann defines atheism for his purpose as 'the point of view which denies the existence of the ancient gods '-a sense, as he says, in which we are all atheists now. The bulk of the book is a thorough and well-proportioned chronological survey of the evidence bearing on the traditional lists of J8OoL, as well as of literature, such as the plays of Euripides, which shows a sceptical tendency. Prof. Drachmann is not concerned to establish any special thesis; and the value of his survey consists largely in the settlement of minor incidental problems; but his general result may be stated as follows. A strongly-marked sceptical tendency begins with the sophistic period, and towards the close of the fifth century Greek intellectual life seemed to be breaking the bonds of the ancient religion. The Socratic-Platonic movement was critical, but definitely religious, in character, and checked without stopping this development. The later fourth- century philosophies were still more critical and often in definite opposition to the tradition. This tendency, however, did not prevail in the end with educated opinion. A religious reaction set in, which found expression in demonology, allied with Platonism and eclectic Stoicism, and unbelief remained an exceptional phenomenon. A new view of the world, made possible for the first time by modern science, was needed before anthropomorphic supernaturalism could be dispelled. The book is well translated, and is very readable in its English dress. Full references to sources are given in notes at the end. We have to thank Dr. G. F. Hill of the British Museum for suggesting and assisting in the translation of a work which will be a very valuable addition to the literature of the subject. J. L. S.</page></plain_text>
