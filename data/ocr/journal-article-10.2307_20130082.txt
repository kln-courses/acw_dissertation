New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. xii + 290 pp. Cloth, $30.00; paper, $16.95?Guthrie has an interesting point: "I claim religion con sists of seeing the world as humanlike and arises because doing so is a good bet even though, like other bets, it may fail" (p. 4). This book is best understood by identifying its two interwoven arguments. The first is that religion is anthropomorphism. The second is that this anthropo morphism is due to a perceptual strategy. He does an admirable job of presenting the first. Marshaling the thought of Spinoza, Hume, Feuer bach, and others, he argues that religion arises from projecting human traits into nature. His second argument basically runs as follows: an thropomorphism permeates our world, in science, philosophy, commer cial and fine art, and religion. There is a universal cause of anthropo morphism in all of these enterprises, and it is due to the perceptual strategy that anthropomorphism is "the result of a general, spontaneous, and unconscious interpretive tendency. . . to find as much organization as possible in things and events" (p. 37). For Guthrie, the most organiza tion indicates what matters the most, and what matters the most are liv ing beings, and especially humans. He theorizes "that perception is in terpretation, that interpretation attends to the most important possibilities, and that the most important possibilities are humanlike" (p. 204; see also p. 41). Throughout his work, Guthrie attempts to argue for his perceptual strategy theory against the two main theories commonly proposed to ac count for anthropomorphism?comfort and familiarity. Yet when pushed to its core, Guthrie's theory appears more like an amalgamation of comfort and familiarity than a new proposal. As to comfort, Guthrie's handy slogan for life is "when in doubt whether something is alive, as sume that it is" (p. 41). Why? To remain safe, secure and comfortable. As to familiarity, Guthrie is much closer to this approach than he wants to admit. His primary argument against familiarity is that we really do not know ourselves psychologically and philosophically; thus, it is im</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 661 possible to project this into our view of God (p. 64). However, he mis takes basic familiarity for in-depth understanding. We do not need self evident knowledge of our deepest selves to perceive human attributes in a cloud or purpose in rain. Guthrie's own theory relies on interpreting the world in terms of "what matters the most to me" (which assumes it is something with which I am at least vaguely familiar) and what brings the most organization in my mind, namely humans (again, because I am familiar with them). Guthrie spends most of his time arguing with fellow anthropologists who either posit religion as anthropomorphism due to comfort and fa miliarity or do not even accept religion as anthropomorphism. In all but the most superficial of ways, he completely disregards the more funda mental problem of how his theory might respond to a metaphysical or transcendent realm. For example, in developing a response to the invis ible nature of gods, he simply responds, "many deities are not absolutely invisible" (p. 51), and he proceeds to explain how animals often appear "invisible" to other animals. He neglects the issues of immateriality. Further, even when he acknowledges the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions maintaining that God is a transcendent being, not anthropo morphic (though human qualities are often transferred to God), he judges that anthropomorphism is the essence of religion and not simply its matrix (p. 185). In reaching this conclusion, Guthrie perfunctorily dismisses analogy, ignores the incarnation, and finds no value in mysti cal silence. In the end, even if Guthrie is right, he sometimes appears more like a nonbeliever collecting data to argue his point than an anthropologist searching for a theory.?Paul J.
