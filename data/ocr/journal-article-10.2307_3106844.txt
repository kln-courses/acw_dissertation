<plain_text><page sequence="1">Building IBM: Shaping an Industry and Its Technology. By Emerson W. Pugh. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1995. Pp. xvi+405; illustra- tions, tables, notes, appendixes, index. $29.95 (cloth). The first third of this excellent corporate history offers a detailed, if familiar, account of IBM before World War II. In the mid-1880s, Herman Hollerith invented electromechanical punched-card tabu- lating equipment to aid in tallying the U.S. census. His Tabulating Machine Company then marketed this equipment to businesses. Hollerith's strong patents-he had been a patent examiner-forced competitors either to use purely mechanical techniques or to license from Hollerith. These patents, his policy of renting rather than sell- ing equipment, and his requirement that customers purchase punch cards only from Tabulating Machine made for an extraordinarily robust business. Emerson Pugh argues convincingly that IBM's be- ginnings should be dated directly to Hollerith's enterprise. A 1911 merger created the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and made Hollerith a millionaire. By 1915 Thomas J. Watson, a former National Cash Register (NCR) salesman, had become CTR's president; he changed its name to International Busi- ness Machines in 1924. No engineer, Watson nevertheless had an unmatched eye for a saleable product and proved a highly effective (if paternalistic) executive. During the Depression, the rental-only policy dating from Hollerith proved a godsend, providing steady, relatively insulated income. The 1935 creation of the Social Security Administration, with its gigantic data-processing burden, brought IBM vast new revenues. IBM equipment also found myriad uses dur- ing World War II, ranging from record keeping to codebreaking. Watson's chief engineer, James Bryce, was a prodigious inventor who personally acquired over 500 patents. Bryce and his colleagues patented new devices and techniques as a matter of routine, not just when they seemed marketable, thereby generating a reserve of technological resources and simultaneously erecting ever-higher hurdles for IBM's competitors. In the postwar era, IBM set the pat- tern for other high-technology enterprises by reinvesting nearly half its net profits in R&amp;D.</page><page sequence="2">386 Book Reviews TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE The remainder of Building IBM treats IBM's entry into the com- puter era, and here Pugh makes significant new contributions. Pugh argues that IBM-including Watson, generally pictured as a hide- bound proponent of aging technologies-moved smoothly and rap- idly from electromechanical to electronic equipment after the war. Watson opposed the anthropomorphic word "computer" because it implied that the new machines might steal jobs from human com- puters. Therefore, IBM's early computers were all called "calcula- tors," and Pugh suggests that this terminology is partly responsible for the mistaken view that IBM was slow to develop true computers. He claims that inJanuary 1948 IBM's Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator-a bizarre hybrid incorporating vacuum tubes, relays, and paper-tape reader-punches-became "the first operational computer to satisfy the modern definition of a stored-program com- puter" (p. 136), months before the Manchester University Mark I, usually so honored. While most historians designate the 1952 IBM 701, backed by Tom Watson,Jr., as IBM's first commercial computer, Pugh views IBM's 1949 Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator as functionally comparable to the 1951 UNIVAC. If true, then rather than being "scooped" by its competitor, IBM computers far outsold UNIVACs in the early 1950s. However, Pugh apparently defines "electronic" computing rather broadly-admitting some compo- nents, such as relays, often classed as electromechanical-in order to claim an early lead for IBM. Subsequent chapters hold fewer surprises. Topics covered are IBM's early efforts in computer languages, the SAGE air defense sys- tem (IBM's largest contract of the 1950s), its Stretch supercomputer project, and the 1964 System/360, the first computer component system to offer truly compatible hardware and software. Two final chapters briefly discuss the 1970s and 1980s. BuildinglBM suffers from drawbacks common to internalist corpo- rate histories, especially those written by company insiders. (Pugh was an IBM researcher and executive for 30 years.) The Watsons are venerated; Watson, Sr.'s vicious, underhanded assaults on competi- tors during his stint at NCR-for which he and his colleagues served jail time-are treated with extreme sympathy. So is his paternalism: Watson's employees conformed to an unwritten dress code, sang company songs, and were not allowed alcohol at company functions. Virtually no attention is paid to IBM's rank and file or their working conditions. Pugh sketches historical contexts but never considers the possible influences of social and political events on IBM technology (as opposed to their impact on IBM's business strategies). Perhaps the book's worst failing is its transparently partisan account of the many antitrust actions brought against IBM during its history. But these drawbacks are minor compared with Pugh's achieve- ments.
