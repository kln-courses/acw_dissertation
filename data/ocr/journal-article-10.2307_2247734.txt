' Philosophical Faith.' rWe have the philosophy of the unknowable, and that which makes infinite reality comprehensible by huiman thought. Both neglect the rationally authoritative needs of man. " 'Faith,' 'trust,'' authority,' are words not unfit to designate the final relation of the human spirit to the universe of reality." Examination of Locke and Hegel. "Philo- sophical faith is the truly rational trust that nothing can happen in the temporal evolution which can finally put to confusion the principles of moral reason that are latent in man."] A. Seth. 'The Term " Natural- ism " in Recent lDiscussion.' [Defence of Balfour's usage.] D. G. Ritchie. ' The Relation of Logic to Psychology,' i. [Psychology deals with events, logic with validity. Confusion of the two in Mill: discussion of the law of contradiction. No scientific line can be drawn between logic and epistemology: Jevons. The ultimate test of truth in all departments of knowledge is coherence within a system, and this test is identical with the ' laws of thought' which underlie formal logic.] J. A. Leighton.

' The Relation of Logic to Psychology,' ii. [Judgment and coincept ; intension and extension; singular and universal propositions; the syllogism. Apology for Aristotelian and formal logic. General result: psychology ought to be kept out of logic, but cannot be kept out of the epistemology into which logic inevitably merges; logic ought not to be kept out of psychology. The seeming paradox is explained by the fact that psychology is both philosophy and science of mind.] J. D. Logan. 'The Aristotelian Concept of Orat-s-.' [Aristotle "transforms the early bylozoistic conception of sbi%t- as brute material will, determined in its ' appearances' solely by its own caprice, into a new hylozoism, accord- ing to which the unconscious will of the world, determined in its 'appearances' by and for immanent entelechies, is ultimately deter- mined by and for a spiritual being, a transcendent absolute entelechy, or supreme good ".] J. Dewey. ' The Psychology of Effort.' [There are three theories of effort: the spiritual, the sensational and the mixed. The difference is probably reducible to a confusion between effort as conscious fact and effort as logical category or moral value. In conscious effort certain sense qualities, usually fused, fall apart. The importance of effort is "due to the fact that it is the critical point of progress in action, arising whenever old habits are in process of recon- struction, or of adaptation to new conditions".] W.

La Jour (' L'Admiration') maintains that admiration is a state of consciousness awakened by an exhibition of will power, or of the control exercised over matter by a. power of organisation or direction. He endeavours to inake good this definition by an analysis of the various objects of admiration, physical force, agility, beauty, grace, address, etc. M. Hallez ('La vue et les couleurs ') commences a series of articles on eight colours. In the present article, after discoursing onl uniform, varied, simple and com- posite colours, and the principles which regulate the formation of composite colours, he institutes a quantitative analysis of composite colours, discusses the geometrical synthesis of colours, and sets forth the ancient theories on colour. S. Thomas, following Aristotle, had defined time as 'nnumerus motus secundum prius et posterius'. M. Nys (' La notion de temps d'apres saint Thomas d'Aquin ') asserts that this definition, properly understood, presents the true notion of time, and maintains that time consists of two elemnents, of which numerus is the formal and motus is the material element. Since, however, move- mient becomes formally and actually number only by means of an intellectual act which divides the continuous, M. Nys is of opinion that time and nmovement are ontologically identical, and that the distinction between them is purely logical. M. de Baets ('Une question touchant le droit de punir') endeavours to show that society, in punishing crime, ought to have in view the restoratioin of the moral order which has been disturbed by crimlle, not, indeed, the restoration of the moral order con- sidered absolutely, for moral fault as such, or considered precisely as a violation of duty, does not fall within the competence of society, but the restoration of the social mioral order. M. Mercier ('Discussion de la the.orie des trois v6rites primitives') undertakes to prove that this theory is of little value as against modern scepticism. M. Mercier even questions its value as against the old-fashioned forms of scepticism, and</page><page sequence="5">440 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. points out that use was never made of it by Aristotle or by the better known scholastics.

' Ueber willkuerliche Vorstel- lungsverbindung.' [The two kinds of centrally aroused ideas: repro- ductive (" anschaulich ") and surrogate (" unanschaulich "). Passage from latter to former is either direct, by way of consolidated contents, or indirect, part after part of the reproduction coming up. It involves an idea of relation. It depends on two factors: the proportion of directly to indirectly ideated attributes in the surrogate idea, the "Leistungs- faehigkeit" of that idea; and the disposition to the formation of the reproduction, the degree of practice. The two factors form inversely related continua. Characteristic of these connexions in general is a volition, whose object, an idea, is thought by the aid of a relation and another idea, which constitutes one term of this relation; the second idea must be different in contents from the idea willed, but have the same object; this condition affords a general determination of the rela- tion.

[If two vertical parallels are cut obliquely by a transversal, itself not continued between the parallels, the two parts of the transversal appear not to belong together (Poggendorif's figure). The rule of the illusion is found to be as follows: The parallel displacemnent of the parts of the transversal is proportionial to the distance separating the vertical parallels and the cotangent of the angle of incliniation of the trans- versal ; the vertical displacenment is proportional to the same distance and the cosine of the angle of incliniation; the angle of overestimlation is dependent uporn the angle of inclinatioln and conditioned by the personal constant, but indepelndent of the distance separating the vertical parallels.

[This second paper is devoted to the emnpirio-criticismi of Avenarius and his school, which professes to miake experience the basis of all criticisnl of concepts, whether philosophical, scientific or prescientific. The writer gives an exposition (1) of the genieral theory of the school, translating its terminology into ordinary language; (2) of the applications of the theory ; and (3) of the special hypothesis of introjection. He then passes to a critical discussion of the presupposi- tions of the systein. It conflicts with positive natural science in its assumliption that thought of the object always carries with it thought of the ideating subject. Its 'Systemn C' is really a metaphysical substance. Its reduction of quality to quantity is uinjustified. Its 'objective' consideration confuses the two meaniings of 'objective,' impartial and abstracting-from-subject. Its actual mnethods are not those officially recognised: they are the methods of psychophysical analogies (principle of practice) and of a peculiar dialectic. Its professed methods, on the other hand, are not strictly followed: they are the methods of economy of thought and of pure description. The system confuses didactic, mnethodolog,ic and metaphysical economy of thought, inclining however to the last. And its description involves explanation.

Against Ribot's theory, that pleasure and pain are indices (marques) of states of the organism, it is urged that Psychology would become a branch of Physiology, whereas the methods and objects of the two sciences are fundamentally different. On the question of moral pain Ribot is charged with laying too much stress upon the external mlanifestations; and hence includes it, as a species, in the genus physical pain. Similar objections are made to Ribot's analysis of the emotions, in which the organic state is alleged to be the most iniportant</page><page sequence="9">444 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. element.

The argunent follows the same method in a second part devoted to Social Evolution, in the course of which the " struggle for life " is characterised as intro- ducing economic conditions which foster a vace iseris as barbarous as the vae victis of the ancients.
