<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOKS IRELAND September 1987 174 r IRISH !&lt; BOOK AWARDS 1987 The jury specially commended the The Black Cat Press for the design of The Beckett Country by Eoin O'Brien, which was designed by Ted and Ursula O'Brien of Oben Design in Cork. It was a most hand some book, and the duo tone reproduction of the photographs ? including some no doubt difficult old originals ? was consi dered first-class. Maps were done by Robert Ballagh and new photography was by D.H. Davison and Nevill Johnson.' However in the end it was decided not to award a medal for design this year. Each of the five books shortlisted for the Liam Miller medal ? and indeed of the seven commended for exhibition with them at the Buchkunst International show at Frankfurt next month ? was outstanding in its way and well designed for its purpose and mar ket, but none seemed to merit a special accolade more that the others. The Beckett Country was considered fair value at Stg?40, but there were reservations about its perhaps over-elaborate typography, which did not make it an easy book to read. The title had been considered also for the Literature and General categories, but it was felt that there were editorial mistakes ? again of overcomplexity ? for instance some of the most valuable and interesting material had been relegated to the notes section. Each of the jury had reservations of one sort or another about the book, while wanting to commend it. Young people's books The medal for books for young people was awarded to the Wolfhound Press for No design niedal Tom McCaughren's third book in the "Run" series about a colony of foxes, Run Swift, Run Free, illustrated by Jeanette Dunne and designed by Jan de Fouw, the first of which had received the Reading Association of Ireland's book award in 1985. The author, RTE's defence corres pondent, is a real storyteller, and the mea sure of his disinclination to "write down" to children is the popularity of his fox saga among adults. He researched the books thoroughly ? there is no silly anthropomorphism ? and writes both as a very competent craftsman and with the conviction of someone who knows and loves his characters. The jury might well have taken into account the com mercial success that the Wolfhound Press has made of the series, with paperbacks, annual reprints, translations into Swedish and German (Irish, Spanish and Japanese translations are under negotiation) and an enthusiastic readership in Britain and America, although strangely no US editions have yet been produced. General books A book based on an MA thesis, Clare O'Halloran's Partition and the Limits of Irish Nationalism, won the general-book medal for Gill &amp; Macmillan against strong competition which included the same pub lishers' bestselling autobiography of Noel Browne, Against the Tide. The jury were unanimous in their enthusiasm for this book after their five weeks reading the eight shortlisted titles, all emphasising that it broke new ground and applauding what our reviewer called "the growing consensus about telling Irish history as it was". Whether Miss O'Halloran's publishers are to be thanked as well as her for making the book so readable by eschewing the weight of scholarly apparatus is not known. Cover design was by Design Image, and text de sign by Peter Larrigan. Literature Having decided not to award a medal for design, the jury solved a quandary by award ing two in the Literary category. One goes to The Gallery Press for James Simmons' (the founding Editor of The Honest Ulster man) collection Poems, 1956-1986. They Dr Garret Fitzgerald, TD, presented Irish Book Award medals to five Irish publishers at a recep tion in the Dublin Central Library on 3 Sep tember, and opened the exhibition of some 23C books published in the year ending last April. felt this book marked the full maturity of a poet of international stature, and was in the best tradition of a publishing house which has consistently and devotedly served Irish literature without commercial compromise The book design was by the publisher him self, Peter Fallon, and Ray Gunn. The other ? and equal ? medal foi literature goes to The Lilliput Press of Mul lingar for Tim Robinson's book Stones o) Ar an, which was published in associatior with the Wolfhound Press. The author him self designed the jacket and the text page* were designed by Jarlath Hayes. The book subtitled "pilgrimage", promoted itsell from the general-books category not onlj by the quality of its writing but also by the breath of vision inspired in the limited com pass of the islands, showing that "loca studies" can give rise to writing of value tc the whole world. Finally the Bord na Gaeilge medal for the best book in Irish from any category goes tc the Raven Arts Press for The Bright Wave* An Tonn Gheal edited by Raven's publishei Dermot Bolger, who is himself ar accomplished writer. The book is an antho logy of recent poetry in Irish, showing the extraordinary present vitality of the lan guage, with parallel translations (oi perhaps "versions" is the better word) ir English ? mostly by poets in their own righi Duals Bhord na Gaeilge</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND September 1987 175 ? which are themselves commendable as literature. Thus the book brings to wider notice the brillance of modern Gaelic poetry, and no doubt encourages many people to come to closer terms with their linguistic inheritance. Silver for '88? Finally the jury considered their choice of winners to decide which medal should be transmuted to silver to mark the most out standing book of all. Here the difficulty of comparing incomparable books proved in soluble, and reluctantly they decided to leave all the medals equal. In fact the repor ter had the impression that they would have liked to make at least three of the medals silver, and that only money constraints pre vented that. A 240-gram silver medal had already been made by Kilkenny Design, complete with the special hallmark to cele brate the 350th anniversary of the founding of the Dublin Company of Goldsmiths, and this is standing by in case next year one book stands out above all the others. The 1987 medals, 95 mm in diameter, are of polished bronze with the bird sign raised in brass and the details of the winning book etched on the reverse of each. They are mounted on display stands of transparent acrylic so that both sides can be seen with out undue handling. The awards were sponsored by GPA Group Limited, Irish Books &amp; Media (USA) and Bord na Gaeilge. The jury were Librarian Nodlaig Hardiman, TV producer Michael Garvey, bookseller John Davey, Professor of Modern English Terence Brown and designer William Bolger. Unknown to the jury, five publishers made contributions to the establishment of the awards scheme: Gill &amp; Macmillan, The O'Brien Press, Columba Book Service, Town House and The Black Cat Press.
