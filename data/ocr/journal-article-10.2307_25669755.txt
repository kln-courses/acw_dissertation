<plain_text><page sequence="1">Grandpa Was a Cowboy &amp; an Indian And Other Stories. By VIRGINIA DRIVING HAWK SNEVE. University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln NE. 2000. 116 pp., glossary of phonetic pronun ciation, acknowledgments. $19.95 (cloth, ISBN 0 8032-4274-3). One can imagine hearing the stories in this collection by a fire on a winter's night in some re mote country house: the comic outdoor adventure of trapping a skunk, the enticing ritual of chasing a ghost horse, the somber rite of receiving a sacred emblem from an elder close to death. These are all experienced by youngsters, thus the book seems to be for young readers in its first section, pieces for someone more interested in the excitement of events than in the art on the page. One might even judge the collection naive in its craft, were the sub sequent sections not included. The tone and style change markedly in the second section entitled "Long Ago" in which two tales suggest what it must have been like to expe rience the clash of cultures in the American West. The second and longer of the two is the more in teresting as a group of young Teton men conceive a plan to ear honors traditionally achieved through valor in battle by the novel alternative of trading horses for white captives held by a band of Minne sota Santee Sioux fleeing their failed and hopeless resistance of whites to the east. The young men are intent on returning the white captives to their own people as proof of their courage and craft. While the story has the feel of history, the book is categorized as "Fiction" on its copyright page. The story certainly humanizes its characters, but the reader may feel a certain skepticism beneath that sympathy, since a clever mind can always advance his or her loyalties by revising the past to insinuate greater harmony with the sensibilities and disposi tion of the present. Nevertheless, the tale is quite absorbing. Perhaps more problematic pieces in that re gard are among the "Legends" of the third section of the book. An anthropomorphic "Great Spirit" who "sighed and rested" after a touching albeit sentimental act of turning the colors of slain flow ers into a rainbow seems a bit out of keeping with "Great One Beyond Understanding," as I have heard the Sioux name for God can be translated. The Great Spirit who sees "the spirits of the dead" wander from the winter in which they died into spring "confused and homeless" seems remarkably modern as He anticipates overpopulation: "'but then the newly born might not have room to grow or enough to eat'" if he doesn't act to clear away the dead. "'I must create another world for the spir its of the dead.'" Thus the rainbow is the product of His slaying of winter-damaged flowers so the "flower spirits" (i.e., their colors) can follow "the 87</page><page sequence="2">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 47, No. 180, 2002 golden trail, a glorious glowing rainbow" into a new world for the dead. In the same vein, "Sun Gazer" tells the tale of a child addicted to the sun. (What else but an ad diction since he cannot refrain from staring at the star that takes his eyes and then his life?) There is in the story a familiar pattern of the sacrificial hero who brings something valuable into the world, of ten corn. But here, when he dies on a hill, drag ging himself up there for a last glimpse of the orb he inexplicably adores, the result is only a "golden flower" whose " face followjs] the sun across the sky". That a sunflower should receive a familiar signature seems remarkably coincidental: Narcis sus and Hyacinthus are surely spiritual, if not blood brothers to this poor wretch. Unique to the New World are tales of how the "Burnt Thighs" band of the Lakota acquired that name in a harrowing escape from a prairie fire, which leads the reader to consider the vivid ordeal of pre-horse people in a closely cooperative com munity so vulnerable to natural disasters. And surely the final legend is one of the most satisfy ing in its craft and charm. Old Woman, "the grand mother to all the earth," and Dog are responsible, it seems, for time's unfolding. She "toils at an in tricate design of porcupine quills on an endless strip of soft deerskin." The dog foils her efforts to progress in the work by biting and pulling loose a few quills each time her back is turned. "Only the dog knows that if Old Woman ever completes her task, time and the world will end." There is much about this collection to make it both amusing and familiar to the general reader. For children (boys, especially, since most of the characters are males) in would be an congenial in troduction to the native cultures of western America. Congenial as the book is, because of its hybrid mixture of fact and fancy, it would not seem to rank among the most reliable works on Native American culture. But that inclusion may not be the writer's objective. What her objective is can only be speculated: to provoke sympathy and af fection for a people who lost a continent and only in recent times have been awarded full humanity by the dominant culture which destroyed their lifeway.
