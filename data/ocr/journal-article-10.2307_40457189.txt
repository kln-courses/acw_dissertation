Calcutta 1966. Cultural Research Institute. - Members of the Malpaharia Scheduled Tribe have immigrated to West Bengal from their original tribal area in Bihar only a few generations ago. Some of them have settled as small-scale agriculturists in the plains, others have become labourers in the tea plantations of North Bengal. The specific aim of the research which has been carried out among them by members of the Cultural Research Institute of Calcutta, was to define "...the difference of culture of the Malpaharias of these two different regions of West Bengal and also the changes that have taken place from their original culture in Bihar" (p. vm). Unfortunately, the results of this commendable enter- prise are disappointing. The ethnographic data are poor. Little attempit at intelligent analysis has been made. Much of the information is vague, e. g. it is stated that "avoid- ance" or "partial avoidance" must be observed between certain relatives by marriage (p. 70), but no instances of "avoidance" or "partial avoidance" are cited. The employment of half-digested sociological vocabulary is at times irritating, e. g., under "ethnic groups" are lumped together "Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, other Backward Classes, Caste Hindus, Higher Hindu Castes, Muslims, Christians and others etc. [sic!]" (p. 22). In the context of prohibition of marriage between members of four different tribes it is stated that "Adair also has found the prohibitory degree among these people" (p. 60). The religion of the Malpaharia is described as "amalgamation of tribal animism and Hindu puritanism" (p. 139). And "anthropomorphism is rare among the Malpaharias" (p. 140) because they have no idols except that of Kali. (G. T.)</page></plain_text>
