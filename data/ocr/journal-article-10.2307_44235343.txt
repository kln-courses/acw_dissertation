<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bringing International Law to Life: Classroom Debates on the Lawfulness of U.S. Foreign Policy Christopher C. Joyner and Tamara Cofman Wittes Georgetown University Introduction The use of games as a pedagogical device requires students to cope with near-realistic problems or situa- tions. The games discussed in this paper are constructed as debates - in effect, role-playing exercises that com- pel students to act as advocates: to marshal evidence in support of their respective positions, to persuade other class members of the correctness of their views, and to defend their positions against an opposing team. In our classroom, these debates were intended to represent the clash of real-world politics in operation. The debates we describe were created for an upper- level undergraduate course, International Law and U.S. Foreign Policy, at Georgetown University. The course covers the role played by international law in the for- mation and implementation of U.S. foreign policy. Central to the course objectives is understanding the constraints international law places on American ac- tions, as well as the way international law is manipu- lated by the United States (and other states) to legitimize and justify actions taken in the national inter- est. Confronting international law in practice is critical to achievement of the course objectives, and this is ef- fectively done through a series of debates on the legal aspects of key U.S. foreign policy issues. Students try to "win" the games by garnering support from the rest of the class based on the merits and suasion of their legal arguments, although past experience indicates that clear winners are not often produced. The degree of success this exercise enjoys depends on two key factors: First, the willingness of students to assume their adopted roles with energy and, second, the extent to which student participants in the debates can learn and relate how, where, and why international law is integrated into the U.S. foreign policy decision-making process and can demonstrate the tensions between national security con- siderations and international legal constraints in formu- lating U.S. foreign policy. Taken in tandem, these two ingredients can produce a successful and unique learn- ing experience that fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter than would likely be attained through a lecture-format course. Theoretical Considerations International law constitutes a set of binding rules that seeks to regulate the behavior of international ac- tors by conferring on them specific rights and duties.1 These rules are the products of various processes of international norm-creation, usually accomplished through customary state practice or international agree- ments. In this connection, there are traditionally ac- knowledged three principal sources for the rules of contemporary international law: international conven- tions and treaties; international custom; and general principles of law recognized by "civilized" nations. A subsidiary source, comprised of judicial decisions and the writings of publicists, is also included as a means for determination of the rules of law.2 An important consideration is that even though in- ternational relations theorists often refer to the "state" as the focal actor in international relations, states them- selves do not in fact act. Nor do "states" actually make foreign policy or international law. States are not liter- ally international persons. States are inanimate political units comprised of fixed territory. It is the decision- making elites in national governments of states who make policy and determine the course of action for states.3 The United States government, comprised of bu- reaucratic offices and agencies, is operated by individ- ual persons. People, not anthropomorphic polities, make policy. U.S. foreign policy is assessed, designed and determined by the decision-making elites of the U.S. government. International law is made by the diplo- matic interactions of these same U.S. government elites. And it is those same government officials who ulti- mately decide whether, when, how much, and under what particular circumstances the United States will or will not obey a certain rule of international law. How legal norms affect U.S. foreign policy thus becomes an important question for practitioners and students alike. Perception is critical to policy-making. Perception (and misperception) by U.S. decision-makers shape national approaches to international reality. The politi- cal ideology of those persons who are decision-making elites in the U.S. government will help to determine how that government perceives international affairs, and those perceptions will form the main ingredients for the Vol. 24 , No. 2, 1999 47 Teaching Note</page><page sequence="2">International Studies Notes Bringing International Law to Life United States's policy options and action choices. In a real sense, what American decision-makers see interna- tionally results in U.S. foreign policy. And that, of course, is greatly influenced by the political values, social mores, and ideological norms of the political culture in American society. A realist, power-focused view has generally dominated the thinking of policy- making elites in the United States, at least over the past fifty years. National capability can influence world per- spectives, affect international politics and shape foreign policies. America's predominant strength can govern the American policy-maker's perception of the world and the U.S. role in it. In this sense, then, policy makers may accept the realist paradigm of international rela- tions in interpreting the world, without even giving it a second thought. This naturally influences the policy maker's consideration of international law in making policy. A host of other factors combine to influence U.S. governmental decision-makers' perceptions of the world and their government's role in it: the United States's economic needs and geographic position; the perceived military threats to the United States and the historical sense of security and insecurity; memories of earlier threats, past wars and previous political persecutions; the country's relative conditions of development and access to natural resources; the United States' control- ling political ideology and its pervasive economic con- ditions; and its national character and national morale. All these factors and others go into shaping and shading the political perceptions of decision-makers that deter- mine U.S. foreign policy. It is critical to appreciate that perceptual differ- ences exist among all states, including the United States. The propensity of the U.S. government toward lawful or unlawful behavior can be affected by these perceptions. It is largely in the shaping of such percep- tions that international legal rules become relevant. The Relevance of International Law Is international law really as worthless and irrele- vant for foreign policy-making as most realist theorists would have us believe? As officials go about their way in discussing decisions that determine the foreign policy of the U.S. government, is it correct to conclude that the rules of international law have but little or no impact on those decisions? When analyzed, not through hypothe- sis and theoretical conjecture but in the context of the actual process of policy-making, it becomes clear that U.S. government officials cannot help but be mindful of international law's real- world effects. International law provides for stability and regularity in the conduct of international relations. International law thus creates expectations for U.S. decision-makers about the be- havior of other actors in the international system.4 Likewise, if U.S. decision-makers know what the law is, then they can fashion policy to conform with the ex- pectations of other governments. In this way, interna- tional rules perpetuate regularity in international behavior, which should promote less conflict and greater stability in interstate relations. American foreign policy-makers cannot escape the fact that international law shapes the components and contours of the international system. For one, interna- tional law embraces and legitimizes the concept of sov- ereignty. Sovereignty is the paramount political characteristic of the state. Sovereignty means that a state is independent from any authority superior to its own, that a state can not be bound without its consent, and that it enjoys juridical equality among other states. The state is politically independent, with equal legal status in the international community. While the exer- cised sovereignty of a state may fluctuate, the concept still constitutes a fundamental operating principle of international relations. And sovereignty remains a car- dinal principle of international law.5 A second point is that international law determines the rules for membership in the international commu- nity. International law sets the standards for one gov- ernment's recognition of the lawful existence of another state.6 This means that international law determines the ground rules for a state's legitimacy in the international system. In this connection, international law also sets out the rights and duties of states. These general rights and duties send clear signals to foreign policy makers as to whether certain actions are permissible in interna- tional intercourse.7 Third, international law provides the language of interstate diplomacy for national foreign policy makers.8 When the U.S. government communicates with another state, it usually does so through international legal channels, using the discourse of international law. When foreign policy elites in the United States criticize an- other government for its actions, some reference to the other state's failure to abide by international legal pre- cepts is made in virtually every case. When a dispute or confrontation breaks out between the United States and another government, legal principles nearly always be- come pivotal considerations in the international nego- tiations that usually ensue. Vol. 24, No . 2, 1999 48 Teaching Note</page><page sequence="3">International Studies Notes Bringing International Law to Life No less important for American foreign policy- makers is that international legal rules enable normative judgments of actions and assertions made by the U.S. government. International legal rules serve as indicators or guidelines for policy-makers regarding the proce- dures or actions to be pursued in order for some par- ticular policy to be considered internationally legitimate. U.S. foreign policy makers might decide to disregard those guidelines because they are not com- patible with U.S. national interests or foreign policy objectives. But that does not obviate the fact that those officials are aware of those rules' existence, legal meaning and policy implications, and do know when those rules have been breached. The point here is clear: American foreign policy decision-makers nearly always will seek to determine what international legal implications are posed by a particular course of action. They still may choose whether to treat those legal implications as a constraint on their policy decisions or as a tool to help justify and achieve their foreign policy goals. While they might opt not to comply with the law, U.S. decision-makers want to know what relevance the law holds for the policy in question. To do otherwise is to be blind to the rules of the road for international intercourse, and to invite un- intentional and unnecessary collisions with other gov- ernments. Thus, the fact remains that international law is ex- pressly relevant for American foreign policy. While academics rightly tend to note and highlight theoretical deficiencies of international law, it is essential to realize that the U.S. government does not deem those interna- tional rules to be irrelevant in formulating real world foreign policy choices. Indeed, the U.S. government attaches considerable importance to international rules, and decision-makers expend much energy and effort contending over the interpretation and evolution of legal principles. Clearly, American policy-making elites strive to fashion, revise and interpret international law such that the outcome best serves their purposes and advances their national interests. This is evident from the functional role assigned to legal advisers in the U.S. government's foreign policy apparatus. The rules of international law are interpreted by American decision-makers to serve U.S. national inter- est. The plain facts of policy-making in the real world are these: When international law is viewed away from the realm of international relations theory (where it is regarded as weak, debilitated idealism), its role be- comes elevated to the dimension of practical policy utility. International legal considerations remain salient and significant ingredients in the mix of policy choices for U.S. governmental elites. The debate exercises de- scribed and analyzed below aim to illustrate how and in what ways international legal rules influence U.S. for- eign policy-making. Why Debate International Law and U.S. Foreign Policy? Use of the debate can be an effective pedagogical tool for education in the social sciences. The American Educators ' Encyclopedia notes as an advantage of debate that it "serves to crystallize an issue, presents both sides objectively, and stimulates interest."9 Debates, sometimes in the form of "moot courts," are often used to teach principles of U.S. do- mestic law, especially constitutional law.10 Role-playing more generally is often used to teach international is- sues, where students can take the part of a particular country in treaty negotiations, interstate conflicts, or UN discussions.11 Debates, like other role-playing simulations, help students understand different perspec- tives on a policy issue by adopting a perspective as their own. But unlike other simulation games, debates do not require that a student participate directly in order to realize the benefit of the game. Instead of developing policy alternatives and experiencing the consequences of different choices in a traditional role-playing game, debates present the alternatives and consequences in a formal, rhetorical fashion before a judgmental audience. Having the class audience serve as "jury" helps each student develop a well-thought-out opinion on the issue by providing contrasting facts and views and enabling audience members to pose challenges to each debating team. The debates in our course ask students to examine the international legal implications of various U.S. for- eign policy actions. Their chief tasks are to assess the aims of the policy in question, determine their relevance to U.S. national interests, ascertain what legal principles are involved, and conclude how the U.S. policy in question squares with relevant principles of interna- tional law. The debates compel students to consult the vast literature of international law, especially the nearly 100 professional law-school-sponsored international law journals now being published n the United States. This literature furnishes an incredibly rich body of legal analysis that often treats topics affecting U.S. foreign policy, as well as other more esoteric international legal Vol 24, No. 2, 1999 49 Teaching Note</page><page sequence="4">International Studies Notes Bringing International Law to Life subjects. Most of these journals are accessible in good law schools, but are largely unknown to the political science community specializing in international rela- tions, much less to the average undergraduate. By assessing the role of international law in U.S. policy making, students realize that U.S. actions do not always measure up to international legal expectations - that at times, international legal strictures get compro- mised for the sake of perceived national interests, and that concepts and principles of international law, like domestic law, can be interpreted and twisted in order to justify U.S. policy in various circumstances. In this way, the debate format gives students the benefits ascribed to simulations and other "action learning" techniques, in that it "requires that students be actively engaged with their subjects, and not be mere passive consumers. Stu- dents should be seen as cultural participants, observing, reacting to, and structuring their world."12 The debate exercises carry several more specific educational objectives. First, students on each team must work together to refine a cogent argument that compellingly asserts their legal position on a foreign policy issue confronting the United States. In this way, they gain greater insight into the real-world legal di- lemmas faced by policy makers. Second, as they work with other members of their team, they realize the com- plexities of applying and implementing international law, and the difficulty of bridging the gaps between U.S. policy and international legal principles, either by reworking the former or creatively reinterpreting the latter. Finally, research for the debates forces students to become familiarized with contemporary issues on the U.S. foreign policy agenda and the role that interna- tional law plays in formulating and executing these policies.13 The debate thus becomes an excellent vehicle for pushing students beyond stale arguments over prin- ciples into the real world of policy analysis, political critique, and legal defense. A debate exercise is particularly suited to an ex- amination of U.S. foreign policy, which in political sci- ence courses is usually studied from a theoretical, and often heavily realpolitik, perspective. In such courses, international legal considerations are usually given short shrift when they are discussed at all. As a result, stu- dents may come to believe that international law plays no role in U.S. foreign policy making. In fact, serious consideration is usually paid by government officials to international law in the formulation of U.S. policy, al- beit sometimes ex post facto as a justification for policy, rather than as a bona fide prior constraint on considera- tion of policy options. In addition, lawyers are promi- nent advisers at many levels of the foreign-policy- making process. Many of our students are in George- town's School of Foreign Service, and intend to pursue careers in diplomatic service or in law. We wanted stu- dents to appreciate the relevance of law for past and current U.S. actions such as the invasion of Grenada and the refusal to sign the land mines convention, as well as for hypothetical (though subject to public dis- cussion) U.S. policy options such as hunting down and arresting war criminals in Bosnia or assassinating Sad- dam Hussein. Preparation The key problem in designing the debate exercise was deciding which U.S. policy decisions should be examined. Three key criteria were used here: 1. The issue had to be highly salient for contemporary U.S. foreign policy and be (or have been) prominent in the news. In this way, students could gain a better appreciation for international law's relevance to the real world of international relations. 2. The issue had to involve tensions in defining the U.S. national interest, often including tensions be- tween international legal requirements and U.S. na- tional security interests. By examining the appropriateness of covert action or the destruction of chemical or biological weapons factories in Iraq, students become aware that the United States might not have the lawful right to act unilaterally, irre- spective of national security implications. In consid- ering the U.S. 's attitude toward the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, students learn that varying views of interdependence among Washington policy mak- ers can lead to opposing definitions of the national interest and opposing policy proposals. 3. The events chosen for assessment had to be condu- cive to lively debate in that there was not a clearly "correct" legal analysis of the issue, and the analyses in contemporary political and legal literature may have been clouded by political or economic consid- erations. To aid in generating possible topics, several col- leagues were asked to suggest what three events over the past five years seemed most important for contem- porary U.S. foreign policy. From this list of responses, eleven topics were selected which best illustrated vari- Vol 24, No . 2, 1999 50 Teaching Note</page><page sequence="5">International Studies Notes Bringing International Law to Life ous facets of international law and its relationship to U.S. foreign policy. (NB: Each year the list of topics can vary according to which topics are newsworthy and the implications they hold for U.S. foreign policy.) For each topic, debate propositions were then formulated to highlight the international law context. The debate top- ics from the Spring 1998 course are listed in Table One. Students were permitted to choose which of the available topics they wanted to debate and which posi- tion (affirming or negating the stated proposition) they preferred to defend. This was done by circulating a schedule for the debates with blanks for students to fill in their names as team members under each topic. Nearly all students were pleased with the choices avail- able to them, although in those situations where students were forced by circumstance (i.e., the position they wanted was taken when the sign-up sheet reached them) to take a position opposite to their true opinion or to take on a topic with which they were unfamiliar, they generally took on the challenge with zest. In particular, Georgetown's large population of foreign students en- sured that some were called upon to defend the lawful- ness of U.S. policy positions that they might find distasteful, while many U.S. nationals assumed the role of legal critic of the United States. The desired format for the debates was then ex- plained to the students, and students were encouraged to meet as a team and make arrangements to visit the pro- fessor together during office hours, in order to receive guidance on researching their respective positions and on what essential policy and/or legal issues should be addressed in their presentations. These office visits, brief though they usually were, also served two practical purposes: first, they brought each team together and compelled the students to work together toward a mu- tual goal; second, they revealed to the professor how the work was distributed among the team members so that their individual efforts could be fairly evaluated in grading their performances. Students were directed to conduct research on the legal arguments surrounding their topic, including those arguments that supported the opposing team's position. Table One: Resolutions for Debate on International Law and U.S. Foreign Policy Resolved: The United States' Invasion of Grenada in 1983 was a Lawful Use of Force Resolved: The United States Should Kill Saddam Hussein Resolved: The United States Should Actively Seek to Apprehend War Criminals in the Former Yugoslavia Resolved: The United States Must Not Pay Its UN Dues Until Reform of the Organization Has Been Satisfactorily Completed Resolved: The United States Should Resort to Mili- tary Force to Ensure Inspection of Iraq's Possible Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Weapons Facilities Resolved: The United States Has the Lawful Right to Use Covert Action Overseas Resolved: The Helms-Burton Act Well Serves U.S. Foreign Policy Resolved: The United States Should Deny Most- Favored-Nation Status to China on Human Rights Grounds Resolved: The United States Should Ratify the 1997 Treaty To Ban Anti-Personnel Landmines Resolved: The United States Should Ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Global Climate Change Students were made aware on the first day of class that the debates carried considerable weight as an aca- demic requirement. Preparation of and participation in the debate counted for 20% of the student's final grade. The course syllabus included an example of the form on which debaters would be evaluated so that, on the very first day, students could have a clear idea of what was expected of them. Mandatory attendance for the entire class was declared for the debate sessions, and substan- tive materials covered during the debates were included on both the mid-term and final examinations. Special reading assignments for each debate were included on the syllabus for the class as a whole to provide them with background on the topics and legal principles that Vol. 24 , No. 2, J 999 51 Teaching Note</page><page sequence="6">International Studies Notes Bringing International Law to Life would be addressed. Class discussion and questioning of the debate teams was a central part of each day's debate, and both the teams and audience learned to pre- pare accordingly. The Event14 The debates followed a well-defined structure and strict time allotment. Each team of 2-3 members was given, in turn, 15 minutes to make an initial presenta- tion, in which they provided some historical background for the issue and set out the legal underpinnings of their positions (usually the team members split this time among them, so that two students would each present 7.5 minutes of the argument). Each team then was given 10 minutes to rebut the arguments of the opposing side. Each team was instructed to prepare a detailed "brief' outlining their view of the issue and the legal rationale for the policy position they supported, and the teams were encouraged to exchange their briefs the night be- fore the debate. This "trading" strategy ensured effec- tive, well-thought-out rejoinders, and kept the event focused on the legal arguments at stake rather than on the rhetorical skills of the students. The briefs were also distributed to the rest of the class, providing them with study guides as well as tangible, student-produced products of the class experience. Following the formal presentations and the rebuttals, the teaching assistant summed up some of the important course themes that emerged from the presentations, and invited the rest of the class to question the teams. Class questions and moderated discussion occupied the remainder of the class period. Several aspects of the debate format enhanced its effectiveness as a role-playing exercise. The teaching assistant opened each debate as a formal event, wel- coming the audience, stating the "proposition" at issue that day, and introducing each team's members by name. The introduction lent an air of ceremony to the proceedings that encouraged students to take the event seriously. Students were encouraged to show respect for the opposition, as if they were in a court of law (with the professor as judge, the graduate teaching assistant as bailiff, and the remainder of the class serving as a jury of peers). The sense of formality extended to the prepa- ration of the "briefs" and even to the dress students chose for their presentations: most wore coats and ties, suits, or dresses, and referred to each other in a formal mąnner (i.e., by last name or as "my colleagues" or "the ODDOsition"). It is worth noting that the enrollment in this course is usually 40-50 students, with a large contingent of seniors and juniors. With this class size, a whole-class simulation exercise might be unwieldy, while a lecture format would risk leaving more passive students disen- gaged from the subject matter. Structured debates, each including 4-6 students, place the spotlight in turn on each student individually while simultaneously pro- moting team spirit and team effort. This format appears to succeed in motivating all but the most lackadaisical learners. The requirement that students confront an audience in a debate format also contributes to the stu- dents' rhetorical ability, as well as their ability to ad- dress perspectives with which they may not be familiar or sympathetic. Unlike most games or simulations, the objective of the debate format is not to teach bargaining techniques or to produce a negotiated outcome. Rather, the main aim in this class was to make students aware that U.S. policy, like all states' policies, is predicated on interna- tional legal constraints, and that, at times, those con- straints are compromised by the pressures of interests (often couched in terms of "national security") per- ceived by policy makers to be of a higher priority. Students were encouraged to be highly assertive during the debates. Players were not merely to stand and read a position paper. Rather, they were to argue force- fully the legal merits of their cases, and in the process to refute the contentions of the other side. The drama of the debates caught the attention of the class as a whole, and the more lackluster presentations seemed to spark resolve among the other students to do better them- selves when their turn came, so as to provide a good show for the class. Some teams were very creative: for example, one debater shook a handful of coins at the audience, telling them that the measly amount she held in her hand represented the cost per day per capita to the U.S. taxpayer of supporting the United Nations. Grading In this debate games, each student had to partici- pate actively and demonstrate his or her own compe- tence and mastery of the material. Each student was evaluated on his or her performance only - no team grade was assigned. Rather, students were graded on how they as individuals argued their portion of the case, and on what they had contributed to the team's briefing paper. Voi 24, No. 2, 1999 52 Teaching Note</page><page sequence="7">International Studies Notes Bringing International Law to Life No "winner" was formally declared at the end of a debate session, although in many instances it became clear which team had the most compelling legal argu- ment and facts to support its case. In other instances, though, the class discussion mirrored the real-world policy debate in that it reflected genuine tensions be- tween the requirement to comply with international le- gal dictates and the imperative to pursue the best interests of the United States. Evaluation Generally, the debate exercises proved very suc- cessful and elicited high praise from the students. They enjoyed the opportunity to play the role of legal advo- cates and to try to persuade the class of the merits of their positions. Students also appreciated the chance to respond directly (in questions and discussion) to the performances of their peers, and they seemed to enjoy delving into the politics of how international law and national interests mesh (or clash) in the formulation of U.S. foreign policy. The students took their debating roles to a surpris- ingly serious degree, engaging in animated discussions that sometimes continued just after class with joint ap- peals to the professor to serve as referee. The spectator often had the sense he was watching the proceedings of the UN Security Council or sometimes the U.S. Con- gress, and that stakes no less than the prestige and na- tional interests of the United States were at risk. As would be expected, those students who read the as- signed materials and listened carefully to the teams' presentations got most caught up in the issues, partici- pated most actively in the discussions, and demon- strated in their written examinations the best understanding of the ways in which international law serves as a restraint on, and an instrument of, U.S. pol- icy. Certain problems can be flagged, however. In a few instances, individual students were less than cooperative in meeting with their team members to divide labor and prepare the briefs. This placed an undue burden on their teammates. A second problem was the tendency of some students to read their brief (perhaps with some annotations) as their oral presentation, creating a less than exhilarating experience for the audience, which was then likely to tune out or to follow along in rote- reading the text, rather than thinking about the legal issues being raised. Third, there was the problem of students having to journey across town to the law li- brary in order to secure the materials they needed to research their positions. That proved at times to be frustrating. Since Georgetown undergraduates cannot check out books or periodicals from the Georgetown law library, all research had to be done on the premises unless students were willing to invest considerably in photocopying. Essential to the success of the debate as a learning tool was the question/discussion period that followed each debate. This period, which usually ran the last 25 minutes of a 75-minute class, enabled the audience to present challenges to or ask for clarifications of points made in the debaters' formal presentations. While the discussion tended to be ad hoc, it often generated mini- spin-off debates of its own on particular points of law or on the implications of particular U.S. policies. Debaters who were underprepared faced questions they could not answer well, illustrating the incentive they faced to pre- pare thoroughly and to have more facts and arguments at their disposal than they presented in their prepared statements. The discussion also helped highlight the legal principles at issue and the recurring themes of the course that were illustrated in the debate topics. The professor and teaching assistant interjected comments and posed queries to aid in spotlighting issues for the class to consider. On balance, the students viewed the debates as en- joyable and useful exercises, and their comments reveal that the debates succeeded in their objectives of pro- moting students' involvement in the classroom, in- creasing students' interaction with the course, material, and giving students insight into the real-world uses and abuses of international law in the foreign policy proc- ess. On their end-of-semester evaluation forms, more than one-third of the students made special note of the debates as a positive aspect of their experience in the course. Sample comments included the following: "After three years of theory, I enjoyed the practical applications of material." "Debates in the class offer a great opportunity for students to become involved. Although I was quite nervous in mine, it was a great learning experience." "I learned much from others' comments." "The cases in class were excellent and so per- tinent to today's international politics." Vol. 24, No. 2, 1999 53 Teaching Note</page><page sequence="8">International Studies Notes Bringing International Law to Life "[I] felt involved." "The lectures and debates combined to make the course both challenging and fun." "Preparation for the debate and the midterm [which tested on information from the debates] was the most challenging part of the course, but most rewarding." Students also noted that having debates inter- spersed with lectures provided diversity in the class- room experience and, combined with an in-class midterm and a take-home final exam, provided a variety of grading mechanisms through which students could demonstrate their knowledge. Two types of students seemed to gain the most from the debate experience. First were those students who started out by signing up for a debate topic because they already held a firm, relatively dogmatic or simplis- tic view of a given issue. One semester, for example, our class included several students from Gulf Arab states who wanted to argue for the lawfulness of the U.S.-led war against Iraq, but one woman was forced by circumstance to join the team that opposed the U.S. action. She took on the assignment and was a credit to her team, demonstrating that she had reflected on the issue in a way she would otherwise have been unlikely to do. Likewise, this past semester's class included a student who saw no reason for international law to stand in the way of U.S. security interests regarding the pro- posed landmine ban treaty. But the debate experience helped him see how banning landmines was congruent not only with humanitarian values, but also with inter- national humanitarian law to which the United States was already bound by convention and customary prac- tice. The second group of students who benefitted most from the debate format was that set of students who would typically sit passively (though perhaps atten- tively) through a lecture course without being particu- larly engaged by the material and without interacting significantly with the professor. The debate format led these students to take a firm stance on an issue, play a role, and develop a level of expertise on a specific is- sue, and gave them the opportunity to display their ex- pertise by educating the rest of the class on how to view their topic. Conclusion This debate exercise provided students with deeper insights into and appreciation of the complexities of integrating international law into the foreign policy making process. The success of any given debate de- pended upon the quality of the team members' efforts to research and present a topic, and on their ability to re- late concepts and principles of international law to the ways in which U.S. foreign policy objectives are for- mulated and achieved. The exercise was not intended to train international lawyers or to promote forensics as a skill, but rather to give students a greater sense of the real-world process by which U.S. foreign policy is made and implemented, and of the place international legal considerations are given in that process. The lasting impact of the debates on the class as a whole is reflected in the fact that many issues first raised in the debates carried over into serious exchanges after class and into subsequent class lectures and dis- cussions. In this way, the knowledge gained from the debates accumulated over the semester and contributed to the achievement of the course objectives.

Joyner International Law and United Spring 1998 States Foreign Policy Office Hours: Office: ICC 585 Mon &amp; Wed: 2:00-4:00 A. General Information This course explores the complex, multifaceted relationship between international law and the making of United States for- eign policy. Topics for discussion include the U.S. Government's powers to make war, negotiate treaties, regulate commerce and conduct foreign relations. Specific attention is given to the place of international law in the conduct of American foreign policy, especially as that law is interpreted and applied by the executive and legislative branches of government. The course examines how various administrations have dealt with international legal considerations in foreign affairs, including situa- tions involving authority over the use of force, dispute settlement, terrorism, oceans policy and human rights. The course is intended for students who have already had some exposure to international law and aims to sharpen the student's awareness of and appreciation for the role that international law plays in making U.S. foreign policy. Accordingly, throughout the course, two fondamental questions should be kept in mind: (1) Do national interests and foreign policy ob- jectives coincide with the purposes and principles of international law? (2) Does international law serve mainly as a restraint on foreign policy? Or, alternatively, is law merely a rationale to justify policy? Reflections on these queries may reveal much insight into the functions, strengths, and weaknesses of contemporary international law in the modern state system. B. Course Requirements There are three requirements for this course: 1 . A mid-term examination (in-class, full period): 25% 2. Participation in a group debate: 25% 3. A take-home final examination: 50% The graduate teaching assistant for this course is Ms. Tamara Wittes. C. Class Policy Both mid-term and final examinations will be essay in nature, and students will be expected to demonstrate mastery of the reading materials, as well as class lectures and discussions. Please do not ask for make-ups or extensions. Early exams will not be given. A major feature of this course will be a series of debates on selected issues affecting the role of international law and American foreign policy. These debates will be organized such that the international legal implications of a prominent U.S. foreign policy action are critically analyzed, in order to determine more clearly the lawfulness of that U.S. policy. On the day of the debate, each group will provide a short (2-3 page) hand-out to the class summarizing the relevance international law has for their position. The purpose of this hand-out is to aid students in understanding the facts of the situation, and to foster appreciation of the relevance (or irrelevance?) of international law for U.S. policymakers in deciding to pursue a particular foreign policy. Charts, maps, outlines, or other pertinent material may be included as well. Each student is required to participate in one debate and should have a professional appearance. All students are re- quired to attend these debate sessions and to participate in the class discussion. D.

Nature of the Debate These debates are intended to provide students with an opportunity to explore the international legal implications for U.S. foreign policy by critically analyzing various international policy experiences. An important purpose here is to assess the purpose of the policy, its relevance for U.S. national interests, the legal principles involved and how international law squares with the policy act. II. Organization of the Debate For each debate, two groups will be organized. Each group will consist of 3 students. One group will argue the pro position of the statement; the other will argue the con position. Each side's aim is to put forward the most compelling le- gal argument possible. The debate format will proceed as follows: A. Presentation of Original Position 1 . The Pros will have JL5 Minutes to make their Original Argument (2 Students @ IVi min. each) 2. The Cons will have 15 Minutes to make their Original Argument (2 Students @ IVi min. each) B. Rebuttal 1. The Pros will have 10 Minutes to rebut/refute the Original Argument of the Cons (1 Student) 2. The Cons will have 10 Minutes to rebut/refute the Original Argument of the Pros (1 Student) C. Class Debate The class will then join in the remaining time for a critical discussion of the legal ramifications posed by the situation for U.S. foreign policy. III. Class Handout On the day of the debate, each group will provide a short (2-3 page) handout to the class summarizing their Original Argument. Helpful Hints: Consult the Index to Legal Periodicals for journal articles relating to your debate topic; for original documents, consult International Legal Materials. Please Note: TIME LIMITS WILL BE STRICTLY ENFORCED! ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND THESE DEBATES! UNEXCUSED ABSENCES WILL RESULT IN GRADE PENALTIES! Ms. Wittes will be in charge of organizing the debate teams.

It is interesting to note that in these text- book treatments of the American foreign policy process, the term "international law" never appears in the index, albeit "diplomacy" sometimes does.

In addition, each subject tests the lawfulness of U.S. policy vis-à-vis current treaties, principles, and norms of international law to which the United States is formally committed. 14 The course syllabus, attached as an appendix to this paper, lays out the debate format as explained to the students.
