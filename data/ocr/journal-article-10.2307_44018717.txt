<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore as Political Rhetoric: Dovzhenko's Zuenígora Vance Kepley, Jr. I Eisenstein 's account of the premier of Zvenigora at Moscow's prestigious Hermitage Theater is justifiably famous. Goodness gracious, what a sight! We saw sharp-keeled boats sailing out of double exposures. The rump of a black stallion painted white. A horrible monk with a lantern being either disinter- red or buried - I am not sure which. * On that night in 1928, Alexander Dovzhenko burst onto the Soviet artistic scene by bewildering those present. Zvenigora - with its camera trickery, with its abundant use of slow motion and double exposure, with its baffling ellipses and ruptures in the narrative, and especially with its frequent invocation of esoteric Ukrainian lore and the supernatural - stunned its Moscow audience. ^ Of particular interest amidst the staggering scope of Zvenigora is the role that the supernatural plays in the film, an ingredient which helps account for the initial confusion which greeted the film's exhibition, 3 and especially problematic is the fact that fantastic elements, which derive from folklore, figure in a film calculated to lionize Soviet modernism and rationalism. When Dovzhenko made the film, he claimed that Zvenigora was perfectly consistent with the goals of modernization held by the ruling Communist Party. He insisted that Zvenigora "is my Party membership card.'"* Yet the film proves rich in traditional mythological material that would, at first glance, hardly seem compatible with the rhetoric of modernization. What 37</page><page sequence="2">narrative devices does Dovzhenko employ to reconcile traditional, often supernatural, elements with modern revolutionary rhetoric, and what motivates the strategy? An examination of Dovzhenko 's back- ground, as well as Zvenigora' s narrative, will indicate how and why he applied fantasy elements to modern, political ends. II A preliminary synopsis provides a sense of the film's eclec- ticism. In some uncertain period of the past, the ageless Grandfather takes some Cossacks to the "treasure mountain" Zvenigora. They rout a group of Poles at the mountain but are frustrated in their search for riches by a magic monk. Grandfather reappears in the twentieth century Ukraine and has two grandsons, idle Pavlo and industrious Timosh. While Timosh fights in the World War, Pavlo and Grandfather search for treasure still reputedly in Zvenigora. Timosh joins the Bolsheviks during the Revolution, but Grandfather and Pavlo insulate themselves from modern events. Grandfather relates the ancient legend of Zvenigora to Pavlo: how Princess Roksana and her people were subjugated by invaders who demanded tribute ; how the invader chief used magic to curse her; and how the gold of tribute remained hidden in the mountain. Pavlo joins the White Guards after hearing the tale and fights Timosh 's Red Army troops. After the Civil War, Pavlo raises money in Western Europe in order to continue the trea- sure hunt. Meanwhile, Timosh helps the Bolsheviks build a modern Ukraine. As Timosh rides a Soviet train past Zvenigora, Pavlo urges Grandfather to blow up the tracks. Pavlo commits suicide, but Grand- father is taken aboard the train and is introduced to the new life of the Soviets. As this summary suggests, the narrative of Zvenigora is organ- ized around comparisons between different stages of history - espec- ially between the Revolution and events of the distant past. Dov- zhenko deals with the contemporary political repercussions of the Revolution and Civil War in the film's modern sections: the necessity of quelling counter-revolution; the efforts to solidify the Soviet authority in the Ukraine; and the industrialization and economic development of the Ukraine under the Soviets. However, the material drawn from ancient sources contains a political strain as well, as Dovzhenko invokes the Haydamakas, seventeenth and eighteenth century Cossack bands who represented a major military and political power in the Ukraine, and cites the legend of the Zaparozhian Sech, a small kingdom ruled over by Cossacks. If the modern material proved familiar to Dovzhenko 's original Soviet audience, so would have the ancient sources which survived in legend. Borrpwing this material, Dovzhenko preserved the flavor of legend, thereby attempting to strike a responsive cord with his aud- ience. Dovzhenko even includes several supernatural elements which would have characterized such legends. The monk who guards the mountain, for example, uses all manner of magic to thwart treasure seekers. The Cossacks seem to possess superhuman powers in defeat- ing enemies. Characters in the Roksana legend summon similar strength, and the enemy chief in the Roksana legend issues a magic curse on Roksana and her people. 38</page><page sequence="3">Such blending of politics with the fantastic runs somewhat contrary to the common understanding of the role of the supernatural in Western literature. In his famous study on the fantastic, Tzvetan Todorov defined the form's core as a situation in which a figure confronts elements of the supernatural in the otherwise familiar world and experiences a moment of uncertainty about the apparent contradiction: "The fantastic is that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an apparently supernatural event."® According to his definition, the contradiction is resolved by a choice between hypotheses, a choice that is bounded by the alternative forms of the uncanny and the marvelous. However, in the folk tradition from which Dovzhenko draws Zvenigora , no such hesitation takes place; the supernatural and the familiar world exist comfortably side-by-side. The task of the narra- tive becomes not one of choice, but of reconciliation between the supernatural and the mundane. The tales which inform Zvenigora fuse supernatural ingredients with historical reality. As Vladimir Propp and others have illustrated, folk tales prove easily adaptable to historical change. Most folklore is passed on orally and is more flexible than written literature. At each narration a tale can be altered to conform to the current concerns of the audience. In the Slavic tradition, historical incidents appear in fantastic narratives, and the combination of precise historical information and fantasy permitted peasant populations to reconcile their colorful traditions with modern politi- cal reality.^ Of consequence to Dovzhenko 's strategy in Zvenigora is the fact that a political, revolutionary strain runs through much Slavic peasant folklore. Peasant uprisings against authority provided sources for numerous tales. The seventeenth-century rebellion led by Stepan Razin gave rise to stories filled with exact places, names, and dates which mixed freely with fantastic elements, such as Stephan's invul- nerability to bullets. In the eighteenth century, . tales of the huge Pugachev Rebellion supplanted the Razin tales. While the characters and incidents changed, the general formula survived from the earlier stories; Pugachev simply replaced Razin. This evolution continues into the twentieth century, and the Revolution and Civil War provided a new supply of historical items which could be inserted into the traditional tales. One old formula of folk literature concerns the splitting of brothers between two opposing armies, culminating in a fatal confrontation. The story was reset in the Civil War and called for one brother to join with the Red Army while another fights with the White Guards. Here we find the key narrative source for Zvenigora. The practice of appealing to such cultural traditions character- izes much of Dovzhenko 's early work. Zvenigora's inclusion of fan- tastic legend can be understood as part of an on-going artistic project which stemmed from his own experience. Dovzhenko was born into a peasant family in the Desna Valley in northeast Ukraine, an area once controlled by Cossack groups. This region, rich in local lore, Dov- zhenko once described as a romantic "kingdom of grass, rivers, and mysterious lakes,' ' where one experiences first-hand "the joy and fullness of nature."^ He came to political and intellectual maturity in 39</page><page sequence="4">40</page><page sequence="5">the mid-1920s in Kharkov, when that city emerged as the artistic center of the Soviet Ukraine. „There Dovzhenko associated with artists and writers who sought to develop a particular brand of "Ukrainian socialism," one that fused ancient peasant cultures with the modern- izing influences of the new Soviet regime. These artists created works which spoke of the value of transforming the society along modern lines while preserving the best of the indigenous peasant tradition. Such works blended contemporary political rhetoric with elements drawn from folklore.^ Dovzhenko undertook a similar project when he entered the cinema. We find in his major silent films, Zvenigora (1928), Arsenal (1929), and Earth (1930), an effort at championing Soviet -style modernization - complete with themes of political revolution and industrialization - coinciding with vestiges of peasant folklore, including fantastic incidents. When horses speak in Arsenal , for example, or when the landscape seems to react to the hero's death in Earth , one finds the anthropomorphism common to Ukrainian folk- lore. And when the hero proves invulnerable to bullets at the end of Arsenal , one finds a direct, conscious citation of the tales of super- human rebel leaders. In Zvenigora , Dovzhenko 's effort to use such folkloric ingredients as part of a modern, political rhetoric takes its most ambitious form. Ill The narrative of Zvenigora divides into four sections, each treating a different historical moment: the prologue set in the time of the Cossacks; the material on the Ukraine during the World War and the Bolshevik Revolution ; the events of the ancient Roksana legend; and the modern Civil War and the new Soviet system. The superna- tural material is limited to the sections representing the distant past, the prologue, and the Roksana legend, but incidents in the modern section often derive from or play off motifs from this material. The narrative device which provides the greatest cohesion among the four sections is the character of the Grandfather. The Grandfather plays a central role in Zvenigora. A preserver of ancient fantastic legends and observer of modern political trends, he stands at the junction of folk tradition and political progress. Grandfather appears in each section of the film, providing a measure of continuity from one tale to another. He even plays a vital part as a character in the Roksana legend, though he himself recounts the flashback. Grandfather must survive through the ages to embody tradition. He is called in a title "the centuries-old guardian" of the treasure, and in this capacity he serves as guardian of the legends of the Ukraine as well. In the last shot of the opening section, Grand- father begins to mount his horse, but he suddenly becomes frozen. He remains locked in one position in a still frame as the centuries pass, a sign of his role as a preserver of the past. In the modern story, he maintains links to the past. He en- deavors to preserve custom and stability, objecting to the upheavals of the World War and Revolution. He retreats to an eternal sanctuary from change, the peak of Zvenigora and, disheartened by the turmoil 41</page><page sequence="6">around him, says to his grandson: "In rebellion nation rose against nation, country against country, brother against brother. Sit down, my only consolation and hope." Grandfather believes that by under- standing the immortal secret of Zvenigora one can conquer the ephemeral. He wants to defeat the upheavals of modern life by holding on to a supposedly timeless legend. When Grandfather re- counts the Roksana tale,, he sits atop Zvenigora like an oracle on a mountaintop. The character is less a threat to progress than a harm- less, interesting antique. The insidious side of tradition is personified in the film by his grandson, Pavlo, who functions as the foil to the progressive grandson, Timosh. The contrast between the two brothers is made as soon as they are introduced. Timosh is practical and industrious; we first see him repairing shoes. Pavlo, by contrast, appears irresponsible and is introduced in the act of blowing soap bubbles. Distinctions between the two young men run through the film. During the sequence set in the World War, Dovzhenko cuts from Pavlo huddled fetal-like in the "treasure" hole to Timosh at the front, defiantly emerging from a trench to forge a separate peace with the Germans. Later Timosh expresses only vague amusement at Grandfather's tales, but Pavlo takes them to heart. Pavlo becomes a ruthless reactionary as a result of hearing the legend of Roksana. Fired by perverse romanticism, he believes he will uphold the heritage of the Ukraine, and he finds adventure by joining the White forces in the Civil War. After the Civil War he makes a complete mockery of Ukrainian national customs during his exile in Prague and Paris. He walks down the modern street ostentatiously garbed in antiquated Cossask dress, and he exploits his status as a Ukranian exile in his speech-and-suicide stage show. By the end of the film he appears as a thoroughly sinister force of reaction, and he cynically manipulates his own grandfather in his effort to destroy the Bolshevik train and recover the treasure. Significantly, Pavlo is also associated with the supernatural figure of the monk from the opening section as an embodiment of evil. Early in the film, Grandfather dreams that the monk of Zveni- gora hovers over him and spits down on him. Through a dissolve, however, it is revealed that Grandfather's nightmare about the monk actually results from Pavlo 's soap bubbles that float down and land on the old man's face. This dissolve links Pavlo to the monk and subtly foreshadows Pavlo 's ability to exploit Grandfather's supersti- tions. In contrast to Pavlo 's perverse education at Zvenigora, Timosh seeks a rational, utilitarian education at the workers' high school. Timosh puts himself firmly on the side of modernism. Starting with the scene at the school, Dovzhenko shows education spreading throughout the countryside. Villagers gather to hear speakers and teachers imported from cities. And the train on which Timosh rides at the end of the film seems to be an agit -train, that ingenious Bolshevik invention for taking education and ideology to the hinterlands. The importance that superstition and magic play in Zvenigora is implied in the title of the film itself. Zvenigora has two roots 42</page><page sequence="7">"Gora" is the word for mountain. The root " zveni " derives from the Russian verb " zvenet " (Ukrainian " dzvenity"), meaning to ring, jingle, or tinkle. It evokes the gold and coins buried in the mountain, the sounds the treasure would make. The suggestion of the legend is that the mountain has the power to speak by emitting ringing sounds, and appropriately the alternate title of the film in Russian is Zakoldovannoe mesto - bewitched place. The supernatural dominates the two sections most closely associated with the mountain, the prologue and the Roksana legend. The slow motion at the beginning of the first part, as well as the slow motion and double exposure of the Roksana story, creates a fantastic aura. The Cossacks in the opening may prove comic bunglers in their efforts to recover the treasure, but like the omnipotent Cossacks of legend, they show incredible powers in ridding the land of Polish parasites. The Cossacks sing songs about eliminating the perennial villains, and they then proceed, with their eyes closed, to shoot down the Poles at will. This prodigious effort finds its echo in Grandfather's strength in the Roksana legend, when he knocks over invaders like dominoes. If the legends produce, as the episode with Pavlo suggests, reactionaries, they also give rise to Ukrainian pride represented in such stories of gallantry. Roksana 's uprising serves as a precedent for revolutionary upheavel. We see her people put in yokes by the in- vaders, an allusion to an old Slavic metaphor for political oppression. In striking out against invaders, Roksana and her followers battle against a parasitic ruling class. The legend anticipates political energies of the modern section. The representation at the victory of the Soviet Revolution in Zvenigora ultimately derives from the motif of wealth in the Roksana legend. Dovzhenko implies that industrial strength, drawn from the natural resources of the land, insures success for the new Soviet system, and in so doing, he develops links with the story of Roksana and the mountain. The revolution succeeds in Zvenigora , not from the barrel of a gun, but from the shaft of a coal mine. In the montage of associations, Dovzhenko shows the development of a healthy modern Ukraine under the Bolshevik policy of modernization. First we see coal taken from the ground. This coal is then used in the process of making steel. Modern machines and tractors are produced from the steel, and they are transported to the countryside to increase agricul- tural production. As a result of an abundant harvest, healthy men and women participate in celebrations and athletic contests. The revolu- tion in Zvenigora is built from the ground up, and it creates a dynamic society. In contrast to Grandfather's passive faith in miracles, the Bolsheviks create a genuine miracle of Revolution by transforming the Ukraine. Grandfather's mistake is that he fails to recognize the true treasure of the Ukraine, its natural resources and potential for deve- lopment, and he searches in vain for the legendary gold. At one point Dovzhenko cuts on a graphic match from miners hauling a valuable load of coal from the mouth of a mine to Grandfather backing out of his hole with a worthless, rusty sword. The relic is small reward for Grandfather's prodigious labors. It contrasts with the work of the 43</page><page sequence="8">miners, and it exposes the misguided nature of Grandfather's search. Ironically, the true secret of Zvenigora resides in the legend of Roksana all along, but Grandfather merely misinterprets his own tale. He thinks riches are represented by invaders' gold -laden ship, but they actually are embodied in Roksana. When she dies in the legend, her features are magically transformed into the terrain of the countryside, and we realize that the feminine, fertile aspect of the land is the source of life and wealth. The opening title of the film had proclaimed that the treasures of the Ukrainian soil had been "sealed in secrecy and shrouded in legend." It would be for the progressive, rational forces represented by Timosh to penetrate through the obfuscation of legend to locate the actual treasure of the soil. In his scenario for Zvenigora , Dozvhenko planned for the character of the Grandfather to die at the end, suggesting that Grand- father's continuing superstitions bring his downfall. In the script, he becomes convinced that the train is a great serpent, and he runs toward it trying to subdue it with a series of curses. His rituals prove ineffective against the steel and raw power of the very real locomo- tive, and Grandfather is run over and killed. This is the fate of those who choose to deny the irresistible power and progress of history, represented by the hurtling train. Anachronisms like Grandfather must be sacrificed to the new Ukraine. When Timosh sees that his own grandfather is the victim, he does not express any regret or offer any lament. He merely rejoins his comrades so the train can continue its journey into the future. * * Grandfather's error does not prove fatal in the finished film, however. Grandfather and his legends are not inherently harmful. They can mediate between the modern Soviet Ukraine and the past. Only when the legends give rise to cynical exploiters of tradition like Pavlo do they become lethal. Fittingly, Pavlo dies at the film's climax; his earlier sham suicide foreshadows the suicidal path he has chosen - the path of reaction. Significantly, the scenes of the blood-thirsty Paris audience contain the superimposition of an enormous face of a bourgeois figure hovering over the crowd. This image harkens back to the apparition of the monk whose face appears in large superimposi- tion in the prologue and during Grandfather's dream. It illustrates the lingering potential for harm in superstition which can feed the anti- social instincts of a Pavlo. When the train stops and picks up Grandfather at the film's end, there is no indication that Grandfather has converted to the side of the modernists. Rather, the scene signifies the new Ukraine's acceptance of the old. The scene suggests that the traditions associat- ed with Grandfather should not be completely abandoned. The old man who enters the film leading a broken-down telega in the time of the Cossacks leaves in the twentieth century on a powerful locomo- tive. The young Bolsheviks welcome Grandfather aboard with an old form of communion, tea from a samovar, as the modern Ukraine remains in touch with its past. The film concludes with the locomotive speeding at the camera, like the prow of the ship at the end of Battleship Potemkin , 44</page><page sequence="9">rushing headlong into the promise of the future. Significantly, the train runs past the mountain Zvenigora. The juxtaposition of an aggressive, modern train with a pastoral environment illustrates the dualism of so much of Dovzhenko 's work: modernity and tradition. And the figure of the Grandfather, a link between supernatural legend and political experience, helps resolve these two sides in Zvenigora.
