<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZDZISLAW NAJDER CONRAD'S THE SISTERS: A GRANDIOSE FAILURE The Sisters was Conrad's third novel. He began it immediately after completing An Outcast of the Islands in the latter part of 1895. After the two exotic tales, Outcast. . . and Almayer's Folly, The Sisters was an attempt at a completely different theme: Europe and the modern world. The actual writing of the novel was not easy. Edward Garnett, the well-known critic and Conrad's first "literary" friend, was negative in his appraisal of the manuscript's beginning. He advised Conrad to abandon his tale of the "land" and instead make use of his experience in the tropics and on the high seas. As a result Conrad ceased working on The Sisters and began The Rescue, with which he also had difficulties, finally finishing the novel in 1919. His next tale, The Nigger of the 'Narcissus,* was one of the greatest achievements in the genre of the sea story. We find the last mention of the abandoned Sisters in a letter from Conrad to Garnett written 9 April 1896.1 The extant chapters of the novel appeared in 1928, after Conrad's death. The story was not included in the complete edition of Conrad's works and remained relatively unknown. The fragment of The Sisters is very brief, about forty pages in manuscript. It consists of seven chapters and contains two completely different plots. The first four chapters deal with a young painter from Russia traveling through Western Europe and becoming increasingly disillusioned. The remainder of the nar rative presents the lives of two orphaned Basque sisters; one of the sisters is reared by her uncle in a Parisian suburb?the same suburb in which the young artist, Stephen, comes to live. These two plots (chapters I-IV and V-VIII, respectively) do not converge. Every student of Conrad can imme diately see the correlation between the "Basque" sections of The Sisters and The Arrow of Gold?a late (1919) and weak novel, commonly regarded, though with scant justification, as an autobiographical work. In both novels there are two sisters, Rita and Theresa. Both pairs of sisters have an uncle who is a stern Basque priest. In The Arrow of Gold, however, Rita is the lover of the wealthy French painter, Henry Allegre. English and American critics have given little attention to The Sisters, es pecially to the "Russian" sections. Their interests have centered mostly on biographical issues and particularly on the question of why Conrad never 1 Edward Garnett, ed., Letters from Joseph Conrad (Indianapolis, 1928), p. 48. 25</page><page sequence="2">26 The Polish Review completed his story. There have been several hypotheses offered on this point; however, all theories seem to have one idea in common: The Sisters has little artistic value. Most critics agree that Conrad's portrayal of his pro tagonist is vague and banal; he is presented in a stereotypical and unfocused way. Furthermore, the style of writing is belabored, unexpressive, and filled with artificial and confusing phrases verging on grammatical impropriety.2 The pompous imperfection of style can be seen as a sign of the more pro found difficulties Conrad was having with the theme. Ford Madox Ford con tends that Conrad wanted to develop The Sisters into a dramatic tale of in cest culminating in the murder of the lovers by the fanatical priest-uncle, but that the character of the Basque curate-ascetic was fundamentally too similar to the character of the priest in Maupassant's Une Vie for Conrad to han dle.3 However, Ford's notorious unreliability notwithstanding, his theory concerns only the hypothetical conclusion of the book which Conrad could, after all, have ended differently. Furthermore, it is also possible that Ford never talked with Conrad about The Sisters and that all he said about the story was sheer fabrication. Ford's hypotheses have little relation to the ex isting text; he even failed to see the analogies between The Sisters and The Arrow of Gold. Jocelyn Baines supposes The Sisters was put aside on the advice of Garnett who found the text "inflexible and lifeless": it "reads like a com pulsory exercise in the art of beautiful writing."4 Albert Guerard, also con sidering style, concludes that neither the subject matter nor the method of writing suited Conrad. Guerard believes that the beginning of the story con tains the obvious ingredients of a clumsily camouflaged and youthfully na ive autobiography and that Conrad had enough critical sense to see that he was writing "with the monotony of one blowing-up balloons of the same kind, one after another."5 Thomas Moser, author of the classic psycho logically-oriented study of the "achievement and decline" of Conrad's art, sees in the discarded novel additional evidence that a convincing and non ironic description of love between two normal European people was a task which Conrad could not achieve. Moser directs our attention to the surpris ing echoes of the tropics in Conrad's description of the Parisian suburbs: "Below in the damp and uniform gloom the grass sprang up vigorous and conquering the ground thickly with a prosperous, flourishing growth in a tri umph of undistinguishably similar blades that pressed thick, low, full of life around the foot of soaring trunks of the trees; the grass unconquerable, con 2 We find a similar style in The Return (1897), begun before The Sisters and always disliked by Conrad. 3 Ford Madox Ford, Introd., The Sisters, by Joseph Conrad (New York, 1928), pp. 8-9.

Moser's theory that Conrad put The Sisters aside because he was unable to manage the erotic elements of plot seems unconvincing. First, it is based on the assumption that an "ordinary" love story was to form the skeleton of the entire plot?it is difficult to consider this as more than just a possibility. Secondly, it does not explain in the least the striking weakness of the open ing chapters. Thirdly, it does not answer the question why Conrad aban doned the novel before beginning to write about love. If love was really to have been the theme of The Sisters, then it seems safe to assume that Conrad was aware of this from the very beginning; however, the text ab ruptly halts before any erotic action begins. The reason why Conrad did not continue his story must be sought in the novel itself?not elsewhere. Moser concludes that Whatever the reason for Conrad's inability to continue with The Sisters, there can be little doubt that his decision was right. Even as a first draft, this is a most unpromising fragment. The prose exhibits great uncertainty of tone; it virtually col lapses under the weight of abstract nouns: "the western life captivated him by the amplitude of its complicated surface, horrified him by the interior jumble of its varie gated littleness." Although Conrad throughout his career almost never completely escapes the cliche\ The Sisters reaches a low point in banality. "He thought: It is dark now but tomorrow is another day." The Sisters, then, would have been a step backward when Conrad was really on the threshold of great things; only a few months later he was to begin one of his most nearly perfect works, The Nigger of the 'Narcissus.'1 Such an unequivocal assessment and interpretation contrasts with the only Polish study of The Sisters, one by Kazimierz Wyka ("An Island in the Pol ish Gulf")?an eloquent and charming piece?published in 1965.8 Wyka considers The Sisters a great work: "this solitary arm of the statue remains a masterpiece."9 He finds Conrad's story closely connected with Polish liter ature: "a story consistent in its reflection of the Polish romantic tradition 6 The Sisters, p. 34. 7 Thomas Moser, Joseph Conrad: Achievement and Decline (Cambridge, Mass., 1957), p. 62. 8 First published in Tworczotf, 10 (1964)?reprinted as an afterword to Siostry by Joseph Conrad (Warsaw, 1967), quotations from Wyka will be taken from this edition?and in Wyka's Wgdrujqc po tematach (Cracow, 1971). I argued with Wyka's views in my essay "Wycieczki integracyjne" (Twdrczosd, 2 [1965], pp. 79-^88). I repeat here some of my earlier remarks from this essay. 9 Wyka, p. 58. Observe that The Sisters is not "completed" in manuscript; it is very clearly only a notebook.</page><page sequence="4">28 The Polish Review and in more than one aspect a story also indicative of this tradition's con temporary trends in Polish literature."10 Wyka's commentary concentrates exclusively on the first four chapters of The Sisters?he does not discuss the remainder of the novel, as if it didn't exist. He apparently assumes that the novel was to develop the plot of the life of an East-European living in the West, even though the existing fragment does not actually support such an assumption and even though the title, The Sisters, seems to contradict it. Wyka also deeply regrets that Conrad never completed his novel. Whence does such a diametrically different interpretation originate? First, Wyka bases his opinions on the Polish translation of The Sisters rather than on the English original. This translation, the pet project of Conrad enthusiast Wit Tarnawski (Siostry, [Warsaw, 1967]), is clearly better than the original; it is better not only because of its more precise use of language, though this is the fundamental reason, but also better in other aspects as well. In smoothing the style and enlivening the tone the translator supplants different literary and intellectual associations for those in the original. For example, by simplifying Conrad's sentence about life in the West ("at the same time it startled one with its inner disorder and smallness"), Tarnawski tones down the novel's blatant abstractiveness. By giving the translated text a par ticular temper, which brings to mind Stefan Zeromski, Tarnawski raises the mere fragments of reflections about life from a level of empty wittiness to one of rhetorical sublimity concerned with the deeper meaning of human ex istence. In any event, it should be noted that in Polish, which is saturated with the romantic tradition (as German is saturated with philosophical ideal ism), grandiloquent sentences seem sensible even when they actually make little sense .... Such stylistic improvement, however, does not suffice to hide the banality of ideas and the artistic weakness of The Sisters. Stephen's vague musings ("I want to know . . . don't ask what?what some other knew and died without telling"); the lameness of metaphor ("They also [the deserts] would speak in glorious promises only to cast him down at last from the pinnacle of his expectations"); the vapidity of Stephen's search for creativity (how much more real in this respect are his literary cousins, Theobald in James's The Madonna of the Future or Pellerin in 1'Education Sentimentale); the non-artistic attitude this "painter" exhibits; and the absence of any refer ences to contemporary or past art all serves to render Stephen a lackluster, papier-mache protagonist. However, in spite of all its shortcomings and faults, The Sisters was able to attract the attention and sympathy of such an outstanding critic as Wyka. Why? There is another, more significant reason for Wyka's interest. The only well-written sections of the novel are those which portray the Ukraine, 10 Wyka, p. 75.</page><page sequence="5">Conrad s The Sisters 29 Stephen's homeland.11 These descriptions strike a familiar chord in any lover of Polish literature. In these descriptions, and also in Stephen's medi tations, Wyka clearly heard echoes of Mickiewicz's poetry, as well as, al though more vaguely, reminiscences of other Polish poets. Thus, Wyka's interest in and partiality to The Sisters stems from these sections. And this is why his analysis concentrates only on those elements he favors. Hence, his statement that "The Sisters is permeated in its smallest stylistic components not only with the romantic tradition of Polish literature, but also with its present traditions."12 Unfortunately, those clear echoes are only illusions, and Wyka's grandi ose vision of The Sisters only wishful thinking on his part. Conrad was a better judge of his art than was his Polish admirer. Wyka finds the "path" to the "Polish tissue" of The Sisters in the lines: "He resolved to return to the cities, amongst men; not because of what the poet said about solitude in a crowd; but from an inward sense of his differ ence from the majority of mankind,"13 which he understands to be an allu sion to the opening section of Mickiewicz's "Great Improvisation" in his The Forefather's Eve. Can this be so? It is hardly possible that at this time in his life?a period of particular sensitivity to his non-English back ground? Conrad would make an allusion to a specific poet, Mickiewicz, whom he was certain no reader would recognize. The fragment quoted re fers to Stephen at a time when, after a period of actual loneliness in the mountains and at the seashore, he decides to return to the company of peo ple and settle down in Paris. Thus, the "poet" mentioned probably contrasts an "external" solitude with the more profound "solitude in a crowd." Mickiewicz, on the other hand, refers to a different form of solitude: the real loneliness of prison which does not affect his hero ("what do people mat ter"), and from which he is able to learn ("loneliness is the master of sages"). Both the context and meaning are quite different here. In any event, was Mickiewicz the first romantic to discuss loneliness? Which poet of the period kindled the "fashion" of solitude? Who popular ized the pose of the misunderstood and alienated hero-wanderer? Let's think: Stephen leaves his native country and wanders about Europe; he has no friends and cannot find his place in society. He is affluent and exploited, and spends time thinking about the relationship between Art and Nature. It should not be surprising that Conrad is alluding to Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: 11 Stephen's mother, Malanya, was from the Dnieper region, his father, Sydor, called him "kossac" (Conrad uses here a polonized form of "kossak" instead of the correct English "cos sack"). Stephen is then half Ukrainian, although he does not express a specific national con sciousness. We have no evidence as to what Conrad knew about Ruthenians. 12 Wyka, pp. 59-60. 13 The Sisters, pp. 31-32, 61-2.</page><page sequence="6">30 The Polish Review To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell, To slowly trace the forest's shady scene, Where things that own not man's dominion dwell, And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been; To climb the trackless mountain all unseen * * * This is not solitude; 'tis but to hold Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unroll'd But midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men, To hear, to see, to feel, and to possess, And roam along, the world's tired denizen, With none who bless us, none whom we can bless * * * This is to be alone; this, this is solitude.14 This thought is repeated many times over in Byron's poetry, once even in the context of "being different from the crowd": I have not loved the world, nor the world me; * * * They could not deem me one of such; I stood Among them, but not of them; in a shroud Of thoughts which were not their thoughts . . . .15 Since there are several motifs in The Sisters which are characteristic of Byron (leaving one's parents?Canto I; farewells, being tired of life?I, 4-5; misunderstandings and a lack of friends?I, 8-9; a cult of Nature?II, 48, II, 87, III, 13; independence of spirit?III, 12, etc.)?we can assume that Conrad had Childe Harold's Pilgrimage fresh in his mind at the time he was writing his novel.16 Thus, Wyka's "path" proves spurious. His other forays are no more suc cessful. Wyka writes that the technique of describing a "landscape in motion" was characteristic of "Mickiewicz and only of Mickiewicz" and that either a horse or a horse-drawn vehicle were the only "means of quick transportation available at the time."17 This is not quite true: one could move quickly over water as well.

And although Conrad's landscapes remind us of Malczewski and Mickiewicz rather than of Flaubert, the origin of this convention in Conrad is of little significance. It does not account for the inner structure of Conrad's works and does not clearly point to their literary references. In other words, if we were unable to decode the poetics of Conrad's novels without knowing Mickiewicz's techniques of description, then and only then would the "Polish" origins of Conrad's literary method be something more than a curiosity. But since Conrad wrote in prose at the end of the 19th century and because he was evidently continuing the tradition of the French masters, his style of description?for a literary historian?is neither surprising nor mysterious. The same can be said of Conrad's anthropomorphic and theriomorphic stylistic devices, which Professor Wyka thoroughly and carefully analyzes. Again, Conrad's methods do notiiave a specifically Polish source here. His style in these respects is reflective of the Bible as well as of Shelley, Blake, Sterne, Dickens, Flaubert, and Zola. In addition, the opposition "truth vs. Formulas" is a romantic stereotype (frequently found as early as Goethe). What was the alleged "direct allusion" to Mickiewicz's poem Farys?a poem containing a metamorphic image as old as the Bible?supposed to communicate then? Mickiewicz's and Conrad's phrases have different mean ings and appear in different contexts. Does all this mean that The Sisters does not contain any undoubtedly Pol ish elements? Not exactly. The following two Polish proverbs appear in the novel: "Wszystko mozna, lecz z ostrozna"18 and "wilcze oczy, popie gardlo."19 And although Wyka's claim that the central elements of Conrad's art in The Sisters "can only be explained in terms of the Polish lit erary tradition" cannot be validated, it is more than likely that during his work on The Sisters Conrad's imagination was steered by Polish artistic and intellectual traditions. However, contrary to Wyka, I believe that this influ ence was not beneficial to The Sisters and actually prevented Conrad from finishing the story. No one to date has asked why Conrad began writing The Sisters. Unfortu nately, we can only form hypotheses since none of Conrad's letters to his closest friend and literary confidant of this period, his "aunt," Margueritte Poradowska, has survived. This is even more regrettable since we may guess that origins of The Sisters are somehow linked with Poradowska. Poradowska wrote?in French?regional short stories about the lives of Poles and Ruthenians ("il y a l'espace, le souffle du vent dans votre de 18 The Sisters, p. 30, "anything may be done?only cautiously!" 19 The Sisters, p. 36, "priest's eyes?that see everything?and a wolfs maw?that would swallow everything.'</page><page sequence="8">32 The Polish Review scription des champs Ukrainians"?praised Conrad),20 and Stephen chose to live nowhere else but in Passy?where Poradowska lived. She also lived there in the company of birds, "parmi les oiseaux," as Conrad mentioned in a letter.21 The end of 1895 and the beginning of 1896 was the time of Conrad's fre quent travels to the Continent, especially to Paris. This was also the period of Conrad's close contact with French intellectual life and with the French financial world;22 he experienced both the splendor and the sham-brilliance of the West. This was also the time of his continued literary apprenticeship, of his first acquaintances and friendships within the literary circles of London, and of his awakening creative ambitions; it was a time of searching for new themes and of experimenting with new methods. Doomed to be considered "foreign" and at the same time afraid of being consistently la beled an exotic-tropic writer (he was irritated by this all his life), Conrad wanted, in one way or another, to try writing about the Europe he was fa miliar with. If we do not take into account the aborted Return, which was a failure, it was ten years before Conrad tried writing about the Continent again. The Basque sisters, members of a family of Carlist royalists, are ge netically connected to the Marseilles period of Conrad's life, 1874-1878, the period during which the action of the story was perhaps to take place. Why did Conrad choose not to write about things Polish? Probably he was not familiar with them (we should not forget that in 1874, when leaving Cracow, Conrad had spent only five years in ethnic Polish territories); be cause to do so would, in the eyes of his readers, have made him a writer of folkloristic or political curiosities;23 because it would have been difficult for him to write about Polish problems in English; or because Polish matters were painful for him and he desired to avoid having to deal with them.24 Hence, with a naivete similarly striking as when he gave his son the name 20 He praises her for the first part of her novel Marylka published 15 February 1895 in Revue de Deux Mondes. Joseph Conrad, Listy (Warsaw, 1968), p. 72. 21 R. Rapin, ed., Lettres de Joseph Conrad a Margueritte Paradowska (Geneva, 1966), p. 72 (letter of 11 June 1895). 22 At the time Conrad was engaged in financial matters on a grand scale; this was before he lost (in speculation) his inheritance of 16,200 rubles left him by his Uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski. 23 Poradowska also did not write about Polish subjects. The time when Polish themes were of serious international interest had long since passed?especially in England. 24 The following works have made mention of Conrad's reluctance to write about Polish sub jects: Edward Garnett, ed., Introd. to Letters from Joseph Conrad, p. x; Jessie Conrad, Joseph Conrad and His Circle (London, 1935), pp. 49-50; Witold Chwalewik: "J6zef Conrad w Kardyfie," Ruch Literacki, 1932, 8, reprinted in Wspomnienia i studia o Conradzie, ed., Barbara Koc6wna (Warsaw, 1963), pp. 61-69.</page><page sequence="9">Conrad's The Sisters 33 "Borys"?allegedly a Slavic name, also used by Poles25?Conrad chose for his protagonist in The Sisters a Ruthenian wandering all over the West. In both cases Conrad did not demonstrate his knowledge but his ignorance. It is doubtful that he wanted his novel to be in any way autobiographical. Perhaps he made his hero a painter because as a painter searching for beauty Stephen would not force Conrad to deal with literary matters with which he was most deeply concerned. This, however, was a fatal decision because Conrad was consequently compelled to discuss?in vague and unconvincing terms?things with which he was not familiar. The consequences of choos ing a protagonist of such ethnic origin were even more troublesome: the only thing Conrad and Stephen had in common spiritually was the landscape of their native country. Symptomatically, there is a contrast between the clarity of country scenes26 and those presenting the life of Stephen?a stu dent and traveler. It is obvious that Conrad had only a vague idea about what Stephen's thoughts, family relations, emotions, and interests should be like. To make up for this gap in knowledge with material gained from his own experiences evidently turned out to have been impossible for Conrad; the differences were too great. The themes that Polish romantic poetry or later Polish prose (if he was familiar with it)27 could suggest were not help ful and actually pushed Conrad in the wrong direction; he was drawn away from concrete description. At this time in his literary apprenticeship Conrad was beginning to realize the fact (so well known today to every student of his art) that it was very difficult for him to write about things alien to his personal experience. In addition, Stephen's disenchantment with the West?expressed in the cliche phraseology of fin-de-siecle?is banally abstract. Whatever Konrad Korzeniowski had managed to learn from Polish literature or from Stefan Buszczyfiski's journalism must have been a handicap rather than a help to him. The traditional and dominant motif of Polish disenchantment and bit 25 Conrad to Aniela Zagorska (the mother) 21 January 1898: "I wanted a purely Slav name which couldn't be distorted .... I therefore decided on the name Borys, as I remembered that this was the name my friend, Stanislaw Zalewski, had given his oldest son; a Pole therefore can be so named." Conrad, Listy, p. 133. 26 The scenes with Russian peasants, merchants, and bureaucrats are not, as Wyka has sug gested, from Gogol, since Conrad was not familiar with Gogol. Conrad's source was Uncle Bobrowski who was well acquainted with such people. 27 Unfortunately, Conrad's familiarity with Polish literature after 1874 can only be guessed at. There is little probability that he read much Polish fiction after this date. However, a letter of A. de Ternant (New Stateman and Nation, 28 July 1928), so far overlooked by biographers, contains information that in the nineties (certainly before 1896) Conrad translated several Polish novellas. These were rejected by the conservative weekly St. Stephen's Review because of their "revolu tionary" nature. The latter sounds incredible to someone familiar with Conrad's views at that time.</page><page sequence="10">34 The Polish Review terness stemmed from resentment against the opportunism, trivial material ism, and political and moral insensibility as well as against the disregard for the sufferings and struggles of others. However, these of course were not the feelings of a young man with a peasant and Eastern Orthodox background. In each paragraph Conrad had to face the dilemma: should he enliven his hero and make him more real by making use of his own memories and expe riences but at the same time taking away Stephen's identity and thus basi cally changing the entire story, or should he hold firm to his plans and con tinue to flounder writing maladroit and esoteric generalities? The dilemma was insoluble. This book could not be written. In spite of what Moser claims, Conrad could have coped with the sisters themselves as he coped with the Viola sisters in Nostromo. However, Stephen, who might have been handled from a distance, while meditating in Munich or while traveling around Europe, now, in the close-up presentation at his home, demanded an everyday realism. In addition, the novel could not be written because Conrad had not yet de veloped the technique of the indirect narrator which later allowed him to un dertake themes and problems that were painfully close to his own emotions and feelings.28 It is difficult to imagine how, without this technique, he would have ever completed Under Western Eyes, or even Lord Jim. In these and other stories Polish motifs, transformed and freed from the burden of al lusion,29 not only shape the moral-ideological framework but contribute to the rhythms and the imagery of the prose. However, these motifs should not be traced by means of philological comparisons, but by means of a juxtapo sition of entire intellectual and artistic structures: it is only then that they may be seen in their proper and essential function. To sum up, The Sisters is unfortunately not "the lovely arm of an impos ing statue." It is a dramatic document of Conrad's wanderings and strayings; it is a testimony of the great difficultues he experienced in finding his place in the world and in literature. Later in his career Conrad did in fact write two "European" novels based on his unique experiences: The Secret Agent and Under Western Eyes. translated by Henry Sikorski 28 Wyka in Czas powie?ciowy. O potrzebie historii literatury (Warsaw, 1969), pp. 6-98, is insightful and cautious in establishing a link between Conrad's narrative technique and the tech niques common in Polish literature. 29 It is senseless to look for Polish themes paraphrased in Nostromo (Wyka, p. 61). There are numerous testimonies as to how extensively Conrad used American sources and how faithfully he modelled events described in this novel on actual wars and revolutions in the New World. How ever, the fact that Conrad's political and social consciousness was formed on Polish soil is an other matter.</page></plain_text>
