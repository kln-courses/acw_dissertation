Their hypothesis was based on the following: Firstly, the phonatory apparatus of the ape differs from that of man, and this element probably accounts for the previous failures observed by authors such as Yerkes. Secondly, while the young ape very rapidly loses interest in and aptitude for vocal prattle, it retains an abundant gestural prattle, remaining, as an adult, a very imitative and gesticulatory animal. The learning process took place neither in a laboratory nor in captivity, but in the environment of a home and family. At the outset, Washoe was between eight and fourteen months old. All the human participants in the program (psychologists, ad- vanced psychology students, and others) were obliged to learn American Sign Language, the code used by American deaf- mutes, and compelled to use only that form of communication in Washoe's presence. The experimenters believed that if the ape heard human language, without being able to acquire it, this would frustrate her psychologically and therefore constrain or disturb her in the apprenticeship of gestural communication. Silence was not prescribed, however; the participants were allowed to make noise, laugh, hum or whistle, etc. To begin with, the teaching method used was based on the premise that the ape would spontaneously imitate the human 1 Translated from the French by Pierre and Mireille Martin.

The present paper, submitted in final form 6 vi 75, was sent for comment to 50 scholars. The responses are printed below and are followed by a reply by the author. transmitters. In order to hasten the imitatory process, however, the Gardners decided to introduce into their sign code certain meaningful gestures employed by Washoe herself, for instance, her motions expressing "to give," "tickle" (which constituted her chief reward), "to open," etc. Ostensive means were used to speed the acquisition of these signs; the referents of the signs were pointed out, especially where parts of the body were concerned. By so doing, the inves- tigators utilized a behaviour pattern common to chimpanzees, who by touching one another seem to establish a kind of phatic and affective communication. Ultimately, Roger Fouts (1972a, b), who participated in the experiment, isolated, described, and systematized the highly efficient technique of moulding, in which the experimenter indicated, using both the visual and tactile guidance of his hands, the position, arrangement, and movement required of the ape's hands and arms in order to carry out the sign which she was to learn. What were the results of this apprenticeship? The learning process took place at the University of Nevada until the end of 1970, and the first phase, that is, the apprenticeship in com- munication properly speaking, appears to have lasted twenty- two months. (The apprenticeship of Lucy, another ape, at the University of Oklahoma in 1971, under the systematic guidance of Fouts, required only six months.) In the case of Washoe, the first sign, "to come," took her seven months to acquire. After twenty-two months, she was familiar with 34 signs; after forty months, with 92; and by 1973, with 106. In order to be con- sidered acquired knowledge, each sign had to be emitted at least five times. The retention of knowledge was controlled; during the last six months of her stay at the University of Nevada, Washoe made use of between 24 and 30 different signs per day. Other results should be pointed out. Firstly, the ape produced series of signs, sometimes in order to give indications (thus she had invented "refrigerator" =/to open/ + /to eat/ + /to drink/),2 sometimes in order to construct types of utterances (/to give/ + /Washoe/ + /tickle/). The signs used may be (temporarily) characterized as corresponding to nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, locatives, and, according to the Gardners, pronouns. Besides the tests of numerical verification mentioned above, the Gardners made sure that each sign designated a class of referents and not only a single referent. The day Washoe used /toothbrush/ to express brushes other than her own represented an important stage in the experiment. It was also observed that 2A word between quotation marks indicates that only the signified (its sense) is being considered; between oblique strokes, only the signifier (its gestural substance); in capital letters, only the referent. Vol. 17 * No. I March 1976 1</page><page sequence="2">the sign referred to the category of objects as well as to the image of these objects: Washoe was very interested in comic strips and emitted the signs (/cat/, /to drink/, etc.) cor- responding to the pictures ("cat," "bottle," etc.). The ape also made use 'of the signs without incitement from the experi- menters, thus without imitative- repetition or the stimulation commonly associated with the experimental reward. Finally, the decodability of her gestures was tested by bringing her into contact and communication with deaf-mutes unfamiliar with the experiment but trained in the use of ASL. For various reasons, at the end of 1970, Washoe was trans- ferred to the University of Oklahoma, where Fouts had just been hired. There the experiment proceeded, but took on a different orientation based essentially on the study of Washoe's behaviour when living with other chimpanzees: domestic home life was replaced by the conditions found in a modern zoo (that is, life spent partially in a cage and partially in semi-freedom). Washoe was in periodic contact with five or six other chim- panzees, several of whom had also undergone the learning of ASL after having had previous daily contacts with human phonic language. According to Hewes (1970), an anthro- pologist who had several times visited Washoe since the experiment began, the changes in the environment and in the conditions of the experiment did not produce any signs of re- gression in the learning process of the ape. At this stage, how- ever, the main result expected was that Washoe would transmit the learning process to others of her own species, so that com- munication through ASL could be established among the six or seven chimpanzees. This result was slow in coming; in 1973, Hewes (1973a:6) acknowledged that nothing new had yet evolved on this point. How should these results be interpreted? In their general conclusions, the Gardners (1969:87) refuse to say whether the set of results obtained authorizes one to speak of a chimpanzee language, in spite of the fact that the terminology of their ex- periment very often suggests this idea. Hewes (1973b:31) has observed that there have been very few discussions and analyses of the Washoe experiment. The existing ones touch on the psychological problems (comparison with the learning of language by a normal child, by a deaf-mute, by a psychotic child), or are the work of ethologists or anthropologists more concerned, like Hewes himself, with deducing from the ex- periment a well-founded hypothesis on the (gestural) origin of human language. Paradoxically, even in Hinde's (1972) major work-which in this respect remains very cursive (see Mounin 1974)-Washoe's case did not elicit reactions from semiologists and linguists, though logically their intervention should have preceded all others. Even in America, psycholinguistic interpretations of the Gardner experiment have been significant but inadequate. Some adopt (implicitly or explicitly) the Chomskyan point of view on language. If syntax, that is, the transformation of deep structures into surface structures, is a language universal, then because language is specifically human, it seems quite unlikely that Washoe could acquire and express the rudiments of syntax, and the series of signs should not be considered syntactic (Bronowski and Bellugi 1970). If negative transformation is a universal, if wh-questions are a universal, and if imbedded phrases are also a universal, then, because communication with Washoe does not present these characteristic (descriptive) features, there can be no language. This logical procedure perfectly illustrates Hockett's (1963) warnings: The assertion that universals of language exist is a problem of terminology and therefore is not independent of the theory and methodology chosen (pp. 2, 6), Furthermore, one must not confuse the widespread descriptive features of human language with its defining features, which are differentially relevant with regard to all that is not human language (p. 3). Finally, there is the risk of getting caught in a vicious circle in asserting that a system of communication is not a language if it is not human (p. 5). It is apriorism to state that passive trans- formation and interrogative transformation are general features of human languages and therefore are among the criterial traits of language (understood as the ensemble of the natural lan- guages of men). This means that the criteria for human language cannot be obtained through mere generalization of its present features, but must be sought through a comparative (descriptive, not a priori) study of all systems of communica- tion, including animal communication. Bronowski and Bellugi, as well as Brown (1970), confined as they were to Chomskyan psycholinguistics, could not answer the ultimate question: is there language in Washoe's case? We shall encounter this problem again in the work of the Premacks, who seem to have been strongly influenced by these Chomskyan critics. Other interpretations have been offered in America, either by psychologists, ethologists, or anthropologists. These, however, are based, indirectly it seems, on the universals of language proposed by Hockett as early as 1960. (Curiously enough, Hockett is rarely quoted, even when evidently utilized, and in spite of the fact that between 1960 and 1968 he had published four successive versions of his views.) Hockett (1963:5), in an empirical comparison between human language and animal communication, lists 16 constitutive features of language (stating clearly, however, that this list is not necessarily made up strictly of defining features). These are the vocal-auditory aspect; directional transmission and reception; rapid fading of (oral) messages; the interchangeability of the transmitter with the receiver; the presence of feedback, enabling continuous control of the emission by the transmitter; specialization (that is, the use of very little [articulatory] energy in comparison with the behavioural results achieved); semanticity; the arbitrariness and discrete nature of the linguistic sign; the possibility -of dis- placed utterances (regardless of the situation of emission, there- fore unrelated to the time and space circumstances of that emis- sion); openness (the non-finite aspect of the number of possible messages); transmissibility through apprenticeship (the non- innate character of the code); duality of patterning (Martinet's "double articulation"); the possibility of false or untrue utter- ances; the possibility of metalinguistic use (use of the code to speak of the code); and the possibility of learning a second language. On the basis of these facts, one can generally assert that, in Washoe's case, there is no language properly speaking, since ASL does not comprise double articulation. Thus, the gestural signs are significant units (monemes) incapable of being broken down into distinctive units similar to phonemes; this question has yet to be cleared up, even after Stokoe's (1966) analysis. Moreover, there is no language because Washoe did not use the code to lie or, except for the use of proper names, to convey what she had learned to her conspecifics (Hewes 1973a:10; 1973b:141). Other anthropologists have asked themselves whether the signs of ASL are arbitrary or iconic. (Mostly, they are without a doubt etymologically iconic and have be- come arbitrary through time, as is the case for most symbols; is the druggist's serpent in France today arbitrary or symbolic?) Still others go so far as to wonder whether a code exists, though without putting forth any arguments (Washburn and Strum 1972). The Gardners and their readers also use criteria such as the presence of nouns, verbs, adjectives, locatives, and even pronouns to determine whether language exists as far as Washoe is concerned; from a linguistic standpoint, this is Europeo- centrism. Languages in which all adjectives can act as verbs or verbs as adjectives, languages in which all nouns can act as verbs, etc., have structures that differ a great deal from those of the Indo-European languages, and yet they are languages. Neither the parts of speech of our Indo-European languages nor their functional classes are necessarily linguistic universals, much less criteria for language. As far as pronouns are concerned, the lack of linguistic 2 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES training of those participating in the discussion is worth con- sidering. Hockett does not consider the presence of pronouns as a criterion for language, nor does he regard certain parts of speech as universals or design features (defining features of human language). On this point, the problem was obscured by Benveniste (1966:225-56), since for him I and you were con- stitutive universals of the speaker's ouwn subjectivity, that is, his consciousness of being a psychological subject. As a matter of fact, children are perhaps conscious of themselves before having acquired language (the mirror phase), but surely through linguistic reference to themselves as third persons ("Peter has sore" precedes "I have sore"). By the same token, in the Far East, several nations so rarely use personal pronouns that it has seemed doubtful that the languages contain any. Regardless of how these facts are interpreted, they indicate that human language can or could very well do without pronouns and still not cease to be language, even in its psychological implications. Pronouns are simply a phenomenon of syntagmatic economy whose surprising extension and formal universality (always calling for at least three persons singular and three persons plural) lead us to believe that it could have been invented only once. (This would be a strong presumption for asserting that language has a single origin.) On the existence of Washoe's pronouns, neither the Gardners nor their commentators are very clear. An exhaustive analysis of procedures would be required to get to the bottom of it. From the work published so far, it seems that the functions of proper nouns ("Washoe," "Mary," "Randy," etc.) may have been assimilated to those of the personal pronouns. The soundest conclusions about the Washoe experiment show that it is a question of quasi-linguistic behavior (Hewes 1973a: 130). This formulation, however, is very vaguie, since it is based on disparate descriptive features of human languages, taken at random, and without previous theoretical justification of the defining criteria assigned to human language. One can surmise that the methodological failure of this ap- proach, in the Washoe experiment, proceeds from the question "Is there language?" in that it is logically not the first question that should be asked. This question is considered of prime im- portance only by those researchers whose traditional philo- sophical backgrounds have accustomed them to consider the words language and communication as synonyms, so that for them one can speak of language with regard to any system of com- munication. The deadlock into which this confusion leads the analysis of communication indicates that the problem is not only one of terminological conformity, but also has theoretical and methodological implications. If we were to ask the priority questions that a semiologist would ask-"Is there communication?" and. if so, "What type of communication?"-we would be confronted with an entirely different and more productive set of suppositions. One must obviously define clearly the concepts to be used. If we were to establish that in order to have communication (in the linguistic sense of the term, specifying human communication), (a) there must be someone transmitting and someone receiving, (b) the transmitter must be aware that his target is the receiver, (c) the receiver must be aware of being the transmitter's target, and (d) the receiver must be capable of becoming the transmitter by using the same channel (as a rule, using the same code or one equivalent to it), then we would know in regard to exactly what criteria we can evaluate the specific relationship between Washoe and her instructors. As opposed to communication as we have just defined it, training (the other extreme but alternative possibility) also would deserve a strict definition. Neither the Gardners nor their commentators define the term; their notes, however, sug- gest simple training if (a) there is a one-way relation between A, always the transmitter of a stimulus, and B, always the re- ceiver; (b) the answer-reaction of B to A is always behavioural in nature, without reference to the stimulus code used by A (even though the stimuli of A are linguistic in nature or. more generally, pertain to a code); and (c) there is always a concrete material reward after each correct response to a stimulus. What, then, becomes of Washoe? The Gardners are correct in asserting that, for the first time, two-way communication through the same channel was established between man and animal. Thus, Washoe responded to the linguistic stimuli of her instructor not only with behavioural answers, but also with linguistic ones. But may we go so far as to say that linguistic communication, in the fully human sense of the word, was established? This brings us to the second question: "What type of com- munication?" In spite of the resemblance, what are the differ- ences between communication with Washoe and communica- tion (linguistic or not) between men? We are quite aware that though she very often answered through the same channel, Washoe was almost never the transmitter, taking the initiative of the communication; statistically speaking, she nearly always remained the receiver, reacting to human communicative stimulation. This confers great semiological importance upon certain rare but well-observed facts: At the University of Oklahoma, Washoe tried to communicate by means of ASL with other chimpanzees and even with dogs. Once, on the man- made island, the presence of a snake had spread panic among the apes, with the exception of one. Washoe stayed by him and, before fleeing, addressed him in ASL: /come/ + /hurry up/ + /dear/. On another occasion. at the University of Nevada, she had spontaneously expressed, without any initial stimula- tion from her instructor, the utterance /listen/ + /dog/ + /to bark/. The existence of such purely informative messages , even though they are still very rare-is sufficient proof of their feasibility. Such messages are much more important in the eyes of the semiologist than the existence of adjectives or locatives, or even of wh-questions, in Washoe's utterances. Indeed, such messages precisely establish, by means of objective and func- tional defining features, the kind of communication achieved with Washoe and the actual distance separating it from simple behavioural training in the direction of complete human lin- guistic communication. Of course, the Washoe experiment includes many other problems and lessons. For instance, genetically speaking, it would be very interesting to find out what means of communica- tion wild chimpanzees possess; this additional knowledge would be useful in determining a baseline for the Gardners' experi- ment. Wild chimpanzees have a poor system of vocal calls. Do they have the embryo of a gestural system, or merely, like the animals studied by Konrad Lorenz, behavioural sequences or initiating acts that have indicatory value for conspecifics but cannot be classified as signals or signs explicitly directed to- wards a receiver? The difficulties encountered in recording in the field and the problems in breaking down the gesture into discrete units of certain relevance have so far prevented even a rough deciphering of these gestural utterances. Among all the limitations of the experiment and the tentative conclusions that can be drawn from the literature on the matter, it is important that the Gardners and their associates, as they themselves have admitted, were always insufficiently trained as transmitters to be able to "converse fluently" in ASL. This is incidental and can easily be coped with, but it is theoretically important from a semiological point of view in that it con- siderably weakens social contact. If there were but one chief condition governing communication, it would be that com- munication originates not from a desire to communicate a pre- existing thought, but, as Karl Marx stressed, from the needs arising from group life. It was wrong to repeat for centuries, from Buffon to Wiener, Colin, Cherry, or Chomsky, that the reason animals do not speak is that they do not think. The best explanation is most likely that of an anthropologist like Kort- Vol. 17 * No. 1 March 1976</page><page sequence="4">landt: if communication remains poor in the case of chimpan- zees (Washoe's phylogenetic starting point), it is because their type of society (small groups) and social system (for the most part made up of relatively isolated gatherers of fruit and other plant life) does not require a great development; chimpanzees do not speak, says Kortlandt (1973:14), because they "have very little to say to one another." This point of view has deep implications. One last lesson of the Washoe experiment that should be highlighted is the danger of the inadequate comparisons fre- quently made by psychologists and psycholinguists: one cannot compare Washoe's performances with those of a normal child, and even less with those of a normal adult, if one is to draw truly significant conclusions. Even if we more reasonably draw a comparison with a deaf child or with a linguistically patho- logical child, we must not forget that we are trying to juxtapose two primates of which one has a lead of perhaps more than a million years over the other in the area of group life in which social collaboration becomes increasingly complex, the manu- facturing of tools, and the development of social communica- tion under such favourable conditions. The other starts almost from scratch: teaching him to communicate means not only training him to handle a code, but also placing him in a pattern of social relations that requires more of him than does the ex- perimental situation. SARAH As early as 1966, at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Ann and David Premack (1969, 1970a, b, c, 1972; Premack and Schwartz 1969) undertook to establish communication of a linguistic nature with a chimpanzee through a totally different channel and code than those used with Washoe. Their ape, also a female, named Sarah, was six years old at the outset of the experiment. She lived in a cage, under the conditions normally found in an animal-psychology laboratory. The code used was solely visual. It consisted of a kind of writing system made up of thin plastic plates in the shapes of abstract hieroglyphics or arbitrary geometric figures, differing not only in shape but also in dimensions and colour. (The "word" apple was not repre- sented by a plate shaped like an apple or the "word" red by a red plate, etc.) Let us call these figures units or signs. The base of each plate, coated with steel, ensured a good grip on a magnetized board. From the very beginning, Sarah seemed to prefer "writing" her messages vertically on the board, a preference which was respected and even codified. The learning process was thought out according to a rigorous program. It began by appealing to the simplest and most familiar of all social relations: "to give." Each time the experi- ment was conducted, a fruit was first associated with its signifier (/purple triangular plate/ = "apple," etc.), then placed near- by on a table, and finally given as a reward to Sarah if she correctly placed the plate on the board. This first step, the acquisition of "denominations," was conducted with fruits, common objects, and persons. Next, the experiment proceeded to a second stage dealing with two-unit utterances, such as /Mary/ + /apple/ = "Mary to give apple." The abstract structure "name of giver" + "name of object" was obtained by systematic commutations of the giver paradigm (/Ann/, /Randy/, etc.) with that of objects (/banana/, /plate/, etc.). From this point on, Sarah was compelled to learn how to arrange the words in order: /Mary/ + /chocolate/ was deemed grammatical and was rewarded, whereas /chocolate/ + /Mary/ was considered a faliure. The third step was the acquisition of three-unit utterances such as /Mary/ + /to give! + /apple/ and the fourth step that of four-unit utterances such as /Sarah/ + /to give! + /apple/ + /Mary/. At this stage, structural commutations bearing upon the paradigm of the beneficiaries produced psychological resistance: Sarah was reluctant to accept benefi- ciaries other than herself. This obstacle was overcome, however, by substituting a reward better (according to the order of Sarah's preferences, determined by separate tests) than that represented by the object shown in the utterance. New difficul- ties appeared for the commutation of the action (/to give/, /to cut/, /to put in/, etc.). Furthermore, using the techniques very clearly described by Premack (esp. 1971a, 1972), Sarah was driven to form the following types of utterances: 1. /apple/ + /similar/ + /apple/, and /apple/ + /dif- ferent from/ + /banana/. c 2. APPLE + /unit of interrogation/ + BANANA + /simi- lar/ + /different/(= "Does an apple differ from a banana?"). 3. An answer to the question by /yes/ or /no/. 4. Acquisition of the metalinguistic use of the code: /plate X/ + /name-of/ + APPLE and /plate X/ + /name-of/ + /apple/. 5. Acquisition of colour qualifications (/yellow/, /red/, etc.), of shape qualifications (/round/, /square/), of size qualifica- tions (/small/, /big/). 6. Acquisition of a complex sentence by passage through two elementary utterances: /Sarah/ + /put-in/ + /apple/ + /pail/ + /Sarah/ + /put-in/ + /banana/ + /plate/. 7. Acquisition of the copula (the verb to be), from /apple/ + /?/ + /fruit/ to /apple/ + /to be/ + /fruit/. 8. Acquisition of the plural with the following: /red/ + /yellow/ + /to be/ + /plural sign/ + /colour/. 9. Acquisition of the complex sentence expressing logical implication (with a single unit, if . .. then, to be read as D): /Sarah/ + /to take/ + /apple/ + !D! + /Mary/ + /give/ + /apple/ + /Sarah/. This brief description of the procedure already provides us with the essential results. Premack (1972) speaks of a vocabu- lary totalling 130 signs. The examples show utterances as many as eight units long. The descriptive terminology of the author also suggests that Sarah had learned the equivalents of nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions (on, in front of), conjunctives (D), and quantifiers (all, none, and several, which also presented "psychological" problems of acquisition). The control tests were both numerous at every stage of the experiment and very carefully carried out. For instance, the Premacks went to a lot of trouble to assure themselves that the sign corresponded to a class of referents and not only to a single referent through mere spatial contiguity; correspondence to a single referent is impossible in the negative utterance /purple triangle/ + /negation/ + /name-of/ + /red square/ ("apple" + "no" + "name of" + "banana"). They system- atically used the transfer test, which, as I have already men- tioned, is none other than the linguistic procedure known as commutation by classes of paradigms. This test establishes that the abstract structure is available without even considering the particular referents. Moreover, they employed several tests to rule out the "clever horse" objection, to which we will return later. Everything was taken into account, from the percentage of failure (20 to 25%) and the "psychological" impediments to the problems arising, in the end, from the uncooperativeness of the now sexually mature subject (1971a:822 n. 11). Unlike the Gardners, the Premacks based their experiment on the idea that it would allow them above all to "better define the fundamental nature of language" (1972:92) and to answer "the essential question: what is language?" (1971a:808). They purposely assigned themselves "a list . . . of things an organism must be able to do in order to give evidence of language" (1971a:808). Unfortunately, their epistemological rigour ends there. On the one hand, their list contains eight features which seem to comply either with the demands of the Chomskyan universals (there are sentences, there are questions, there is a copula, there are complex sentences),. or with everyone's CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES conception of language (there are words, there are quantifiers and other parts of speech, etc.), or with the classical concerns of animal psychology (capacity for abstraction, capacity to function with conceptual classes and not only concrete single referents). On the other hand, they add other features, negative and positive, deriving either (apparently) from Chomsky, from Hockett, or from common sense. Besides, they themselves state (p. 809) that "this list [of eight features] is in no sense exhaus- tive, nor are the items on it of comparable [defining] logical order." Yet, they wish to distinguish between "language as a general system and the particular form this system takes in its use by man" (p. 822 n. 1), without realizing that it would be far safer to avoid this a priori polysemy of the word language, which has so confused the philosophy of language. It would be better to confine the term language to the particular system of man, which is already well defined, and speak of a "system of communication" whenever it has not been established whether a system contains all the defining features of human natural languages. They use the term "communication systems" on one occasion (1972:92), but they do not confine themselves to it. Yet, they are conscious of the risk of trapping themselves in the age-old vicious circle: only men have language, and language is the system of communication proper to man. They also write: "Because man is the only creature with natural language, we tend to assign a definitional weight to every aspect of human language. Yet it is equally reasonable to suppose that only certain features are critical, while others are secondary and should not be given definitional weight" (p. 822 n. 1). It is regrettable that, having stated this, they lose no time in doing what they have specifically warned us not to do, leaving undone what should be done. As for Washoe, I have already said that it would be scien- tifically unwise to consider the noun, the adjective, the pronoun, the verb, and the quantifiers as defining features of language. (The quantifiers are interesting from the point of view of animal psychology, but, rightly, neither Hockett nor Greenberg names them among his universals.) It seems just as unreasonable to refer to them as words, given the great inaccuracy of the term in general linguistics. Like Hockett, I think it advisable to speak of minimal signifier units of a discrete nature, i.e., that can be segmented in a stable manner. Most Chomskyan universals are questionable if one seeks to establish them as criteria for language. For instance, Hockett does not consider syntax or, in particular, the existence of a functional order in the signs of the utterance as one of his 16 design features, although thev constitute a feature of all known languages; one can conceive of languiages in which all the func- tional relations between the units would be ensured by the semantics of those units (cf. Francois 1968:249). The Premacks went to a great deal of trouble to teach Sarah the usage of the verb to be, which is far from a necessary universal: many languages, such as Latin, Russian, and Arabic, do not have a copula for the present tense. The same can be said of the plural, as surprising as this may appear to the common sense of those who speak an Indo-European language. Concerning numerical concordance, the Premacks were uneasy about excluding the following utterance from their procedure: "red" + "green" + "to be" + "plural sign" + "colour" + "plural sign." Speci- fying that "the restriction is temporary" (1971a:816), they did not for a moment suspect that the concordance of certain classes of units is not universal (the average Frenchman, in his philosophy of language, is alwavs amazed at the weakness of the English language, where the adjective is not in concord with the noun). Similarly, because English does not make use of a particle to express the dative case for "Mary gives Sarah chocolate," the Premacks elude the problem which would certainly have worried them (without reason), had they been French, in the utterance "Mary gives apple to Sarah." The absence of the genitive case in Sarah's code also in- conveniences them: they regret that certain of their units mean "colour-of," "name-of," and not "colour" + "of" (with a specific sign). But they are indifferent to the fact that the sign that they translate "insert" in fact means "to put + in" (a good example of a case in which "syntax" is ensured by semantics: the order is unimportant, as one cannot put the pail into the apple). The Premacks also seriously examine the problem of introducing the concepts animate inanimate, certainly not defining features of all languages. These examples show at one and the same time the burden resting upon the Premacks from the commonsense presuppositions about languages and the diffuse atmosphere of Chomskyan uni- versals. Indeed, the learning of the two types of complex sentences is very interesting from the standpoint of animal psychology. The fact that Sarah was capable of carrying out the instruction "Sarah" + "put-in" + "banana" + "pail" + "apple" + "plate" indicates that the abstract structure memorized by the ape was more complex than the linear structure of her sentence. Sarah did not establish an illegitimate functional relation between "pail" and "apple" because they were contiguous. She did, however, establish a correct one between "put-in" and "apple," which were not adjacent in the utter- ance. It is perhaps more interesting from the point of view of the psychology of intelligence that Sarah should have been ca- pable of correctly interpreting "Sarah" + "to give" + "apple" + "Randy" + "implies" + "Mary" + "to give" + "choco- late" + "Sarah" (i.e., "If Sarah gives Randy an apple, then Mary gives Sarah a chocolate"). Even such complex sentences are not a universal necessary for defining language. The development of the relative sentence, in the families of lan- guages that can be traced back over four or five thousand years, shows that it is a historical acquisition and not a given at the origin of all language. The Premacks are consequently wrong when they also concern themselves with obtaining, after /Mary/ + /to give/ + /apple/ + /banana/ (which is a paratactic structure), a sentence with the conjunction: /Mary/ + /to give/ + /apple/ + /and/ + /banana/. A formally marked conjunction is not a necessary universal. An appeal to two of Hockett's criteria is very interesting: If one shows that Sarah's code contains all the criteria for lan- guage except "rapid fading," then one suggests that that feature is not, as Hockett professes, a defining feature of language (even though it is a physio-psychological feature important for the functioning of language). It is not the same story for another of Hockett's features: "there are no phonemes in the language" (Premack 1971a:809). If one agrees with Martinet that double articulation, in phonemes and monemes, is a main defining feature of language, then one has the scientific means to say how the code used by Sarah differs from a language. (Premack devised and described a code which would contain such duality of patterning, but did not use it [1971a:822 n. 4].) Thus, generally speaking, whatever the attitude may be regarding the criteria for language, Premack deserves criticism of two kinds. Firstly, he should have systematically tested the communication established by Sarah with every one of Hock- ett's 16 features, then with every one of the Chomskyan universals (a difficult task, as the list seems to be open), and last with every one of the features that philosophers and common belief assign to language properly speaking. Al- ternatively, he should have accounted for his own list, specifying the reasons he kept or rejected such-and-such a feature of the three known sets or added such-and-such new features of his choice. By proceeding the way he did, he depended both too much and too little on his predecessors, using them without rigour and as a result not being able to say in the end whether or not there was language. Above all, as was the case with the Gardners and Washoe, he committed a fundamental Vol. 17 * No. I March 1976</page><page sequence="6">error of method by asking the question, in the first place, whether or not one could speak of language where Sarah was concerned. Here again, the fundamental questions remain: "Is there communication? What type of communication?" By provisionally adopting our earlier definition of communi- cation, we rediscover, in another form, the question "Is this communication or training?" Premack was conscious of this problem, but did not give it the main theoretical place he should have in the experiment: he considered it in the classical sense of "the clever horse." This has to do with cases of training carried out at the turn of the century on horses which seemed to obey stimuli of a linguistic nature, i.e., to carry out orders involving linguistic decoding of the utterances emitted ("Show me the letter T," etc.). As a matter of fact, the linguistic stimulus was not decoded as such, but rather associated with non-linguistic signals revealed by the body or face of the instructor, although too tenuous to be perceived by the spectators. Premack approached this problem by using either an instructor wearing dark glasses (thus eliminating any indications stemming from the gaze), an absent instructor (Sarah would enter the cage where the board was kept only after the instructor had left, having written his message), or an instructor who had not learned the code (thus, transcribing the messages without knowing their meaning, simply by following instructions transmitted by way of numbers: /5/ = "put down the yellow square," etc.). With all these techniques, the score of achievements perceptibly decreased; this is worthy of notice. Another touchy point which does not seem to have preoccupied Premack much is the fairly steady percentage of failure (about 20%). At first glance, this differs a great deal from the human learning process, perhaps because of the instability of attention, the fragility of the motivation, and the superficiality of the social relationships. The results of the Washoe and Sarah experiments are so fascinating in their technical perfection, and so essential as to the conclusions that can be drawn from them, assuming that they are what they appear to be, that I readily under- stand the hesitation of ethologists and psychologists in declaring themselves. Many of them, having studied the publications and films on the subject, have expressed the conviction that the experiments once again demonstrate training, but up until now they have been unable logically to formulate their argu- mentation. As for the linguists and semiologists, there was never any question of underestimating or underevaluating the importance of these two experiments. I believe that they will remain a great moment in 20th-century ethology and animal psychology. Still, as a linguist and semiologist, I am not in- sensitive to the worries or dissatisfactions that confront the psychologist in explaining them. For instance, the fact that all the interpretations of the meaning of the experiments are based on linguistic translations of the messages exchanged (all of which are in English) may create the illusion that the systems of communication with Washoe contain nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and even pronouns because English translations contain them. Having tried, in the last three years, to analyse the Sarah experiment, I found most worrisome the following: could the illusion of language come from the fact that the coded messages are always "para- phrased" in English (cf. Premack 1971a:809, 811, where this word is employed)? Could the "meanings" of all Sarah's messages not be reduced to two: (a) "If I put two, three, ... eight well-defined plates in such an order, I will receive a fruit, a chocolate, or a candy, etc." (b) "'If I put two, three, . . . eight well-defined plates in any order other than the first, I will not receive a fruit, a chocolate, or a candy, etc."? Thus, we would be confronted with a very complex case of training, containing a number of exercises-but it would still be a case of training. David Premack is too good an experimenter and psycholo- gist not to have sensed this objection, although he never phrases it quite in this way. He asks himself, for example, "what the sign /to be/ really means to Sarah" (1971a:815), and he admits that "we cannot know what the connectives [and, or, if. . . then] really mean to her" (p. 822 n. 13). He sets this problem in the light of traditional philosophy: since language is the expression of thought, "was Sarah able to think in the plastic-word language?" (1972:97). Phrasing the question in this manner-which is neither linguistic nor semiological-enables him to answer in equally traditional philosophical terms, although he admits that "additional research is needed before we shall have definitive answers" (p. 97). The essential part of this answer lies in that Sarah has a capacity for abstraction, i.e., that she can classify different objects from one feature that they have in common (/red/, /small/, /square/, /fruit/, etc.). Animal psychology has been aware of this for a very long time; as early as 1943, Buyssens quoted Verlaine's experiments, which date back to 1928, and those of Koehler on crows, squirrels, parrots, etc., which had confirmed it. The experiment with Sarah contributes the outstanding demonstration that an ape can acquire an abstract structure of utterances filled in by units classified in paradigms. Premack also observed that Sarah could symbolize: she was able to relate the referent APPLE to its sign /purple triangle/, etc., she knew how to use the signs when the referents were not supplied, and she was capable of analysing abstract features (/red/, /round/, etc.) which characterize the referent APPLE by working from the sign /purple triangle/ (1971a: 820). In 1972, the only missing element was that there was no proof "that when she is given the word 'apple' and no apple is present, she can think 'apple,' that is, mentally represent the meaning of the word to herself" (1972:97). The results achieved, says Premack, enable him to answer categorically the question of whether Sarah is able to symbolize, and there- fore think (1972:97; 1971a:820). Here again one can discern an error of logic. On the one hand, Premack provides eight defining features of language; on the other hand, he presents another definition of language, along the way: "To think with language requires being able to generate the meaning of words in the absence of their external representation" (1972:97). This is a criterion for language, but language remains traditionally defined as "expression of thought." Now, Premack's own experiment and the analysis of its results allow us to phrase the question more precisely: Do the ability to abstract and to symbolize, on the one hand, and the ability to communicate (eventually by means of language), on the other, stand for two distinct kinds of learning, most likely different in such a way that the first does not automatically imply the second? The traditional philosophy of language, by defining language as the activity of expressing thought, con- centrated on the first kind of learning (to abstract and to symbolize, both considered thinking operations) and did not examine the second (to communicate). This brings us to the problem of how we are to demonstrate- without first asking if one can speak of language-whether communication with Sarah does exist. What has been said of Washoe thus takes on new importance. That Sarah used a copula is much less important than this other fact which does not retain Premack's attention: following the experimental sessions, Sarah, all alone in her cage (outside any experimental situation), picked up objects or signs and composed utterances on the models of the structures that she had just learned (1971a:810). Can one discern the transition of the main and primary function of her code, social communication, to a secondary use of it, the possibility of developing for oneself the expression of one's own view of the world? Or does this ex- pression only represent play? Likewise, that Sarah apparently knew how to handle the conjunction and seems less important than this other fact: Sarah could be driven to describe the instructor's behaviour instead of responding to his utterance. 6 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES For example, she produced /Randy/ + /to put/ + /yellow/ + /on/ + /red/ instead of carrying out the order to place the /yellow/ sign on the /red/ sign. This could mean the beginning of an activity in which Sarah could act as the initial trans- mitter. In October 1972, Sarah did not yet ask questions. If she had, it would have been an outstanding fact, not because interroga- tive transformation is a universal, but because it would have shown that communication with Sarah could really function both ways, with the ape acting as the initial transmitter (without the influence of an experimenter). Premack did not realize the crucial importance of this fact. He merelv observed, as a fact devoid of all interest, that "Sarah was never put in a situation that might induce . .. interrogation, because for our purposes it was easier to teach Sarah to answer questions" (1972:95; cf. 1971a:822). All this leads me to conclude that, in spite of the great interest in this experiment and in its teachings, the question (preliminary to all others) of what defines the type of com- munication that exists between man and Sarah has not yet been correctly answered, in part because it has not been properly asked. One may still hesitate-for want of being able to prove that Sarah operates as an initial transmitter-to say whether or not it is simply a question of training. Regarding this, certain of Washoe's behaviour patterns are more im- portant, and seem to indicate that she is closer to the stage of human communication in its proper sense. If, like Premack, we conclude by saying that "Sarah had managed to learn a code, a simple language that nevertheless included some of the characteristic features of natural language" (1972:99), we conceal the fact that the defining value of these features has not been correctly evaluated, from the theoretical standpoint of what communication is, in the first place. Regardless of the fact that Premack's experiment may be criticized in such a manner, it nevertheless offers precious theoretical confirmations to the linguist and semiologist. It shows that teaching a language consists simply in outwardly reflecting the articulation of the worid of experience, i.e., the organization of knowledge. This justifies a linguistic train of thought extending from Saussure to Whorf (cf. Premack 1972:95; 1971a:810). But to verify that there is no way to acquire a meaning other than differentially-by opposing it to another meaning that can be commuted with it-is a good experimental demonstration in animal psychology of Saus- surian semantics: on this point, Premack's considerations on the acquisition of if . .. then, and, and the copula are exemplary (1971a:815). Semiological analysis suggests that the chief limitation of the Premack experiment lies, to begin with, in the poor social relations set up by the type of experimentation chosen. Life in captivity and experimental behaviourist conditioning do not stimulate relations that allow true communication, which in turn would initiate the use of and enrich the svstem of com- munication taught. The fact that Washoe never saw the humans surrounding her make use of her code can be interpret- ed in the same way, as Hewes sensed. The same can be said of Sarah's rapid loss of motivation in a situation of conditioning and of her visible loss of interest as soon as the instructor wearing the dark glasses, or the one who did not know her code, entered into the experiment. It is a theoretical error to consider reluctance to communicate as a simple "psychological" and contingent fact, marginal to the interpretation of the experiment. One can equally well say that between Washoe's "clinical" apprenticeship and Sarah's experimental appren- ticeship there is the same type of communicational difference- and result-as there is between learning a foreign language in a foreign country, under the conditions of true communication, and learning that language by doing structural exercises in a language laboratory, under the most fictitious and abstract conditions of communication. It is not a philosophical whim to say that the primary and central function of language is to satisfy the need for social communication, but a statement of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic reality. From this point of view, the Washoe experiment, even though less satisfying and less rigorous, is more important than the Sarah experiment, mainly through contrast. If something more can be learned from these experiments, it is that the ideological presuppositions of an era have an epistemological impact on research. When they state as an obvious fact that "man is the only creature with natural language," the Premacks confine themselves, without knowing it, to a vicious circle that prevents them from accurately stating even the main (preliminary) problems-those of the criteria for communication in general and for human linguistic communication in particular. They conclude by saying (cf. Premack 1971b) that even after their experiments and the meanings drawn from them, man's uniqueness in matters of language is preserved, since chimpanzees are unable to teach language to men. This ultimate argument shows that their presupposition was not just a manner of speaking inherited from the traditional philosophical way of posing the problems of language, but rather a preconceived ideological notion: they are not ready to leave the side of those who wish to main- tain an ultimate defensive gap in the debate over the radical separation between man and ape. They do not feel free to accept whatever they may find-perhaps the existence of an uninterrupted chain of types of communication, becoming more and more complex, between animal and man. ABSTRACT In the last ten years, entirely new experiments have been undertaken in the field of animal communication. The works of Allen and Beatrice Gardner with the chimpanzee Washoe and David and Ann Premack with Sarah should have held the attention of linguists and semiologists more than they have up to now. It is from this standpoint that they are examined here. RESUME Des experiences revolutionnaires en matiere de communication animale ont eu lieu depuis dix ans.

BRUNELLE 9, rue de la Libe'ration, 91430 Igny, France. 24 viii 75 Mounin propose une rigoureuse analyse d'experimentations dont la vulgarisation tout a la fois abreuve et peut submerger un public insuffisamment averti. Elle constitue une remar- quable contribution au grand tournant pris par les sciences humaines en cette seconde moitie du XXe siecle. La capacite de produire, d'entretenir, de transmettre et de developper un langage articule est, depuis les origines de la reflexion de l'homme sur lui-meme, au centre ou au coeur du phenomene humain. On sait comment la linguistique structurale a su, pour enrichir l'anthropologie, transformer ce constat en methode. Mais, meme l'elargissement de la linguistique en une semiotique (ou semiologie) comme science des signes laisse en general intact le postulat du "man's uniqueness in matters of language." Or voici que des experiences et des observations semblent avoir rendu l'ethologie comparee capable de rendre a la linguistique les services qu'elle a proposes a l' ensemble des sciences humaines. Constater que dans la prehistoire le geste fabricateur d'outils est toujours contemporain de la parole (Leroi-Gourhan 1964, 1974), ajouter (Kortlandt 1973 entre autres) que ces deux activites ne se developpent conjointement que dans le cadre de societes suffisamment larges et a l'activite economique tres diversifiee, ne saurait desormais interdire qu'on s'interesse aux observations d'une Jane Goodall sur un debut de fabrication d'outil chez les singes, ni qu'on critique pour la rendre lucide l' epistemologie latente des experiences d'apprentissage de divers langages a divers animaux. Ainsi les sciences humaines se reunifient d'autant mieux qu'elles aiguisent leurs diffrences. Une meme epistemologie les inspire: discerner les seuils dans la continuite de l'evolution du vivant. En appliquant par exemple les methodes de l'ethologie a l'observation de l'enfant et de l'homme, en operant la subversion ethnologique qui transforme l'observe en observa- teur, en decelant au cours de l'histoire les transformations du psychisme humain (Meyerson 1947, Vernant 1966), les sciences humaines sont en train de realiser le grand projet epistemolo- gique des Pieron (1959) et des Wallon (1973): constituer une psychologie veritablement genetique qui puisse rendre compte de la coexistence en l'homme de ce qui est encore animal et de ce qui ne l'est plus. [Mounin offers a rigorous analysis of experiments whose popu- larization inundates and may overwhelm an insufficiently in- formed public. It constitutes a remarkable contribution to the great change in direction made by the human sciences in this second half of the 20th century. The ability to produce, main- tain, transmit, and develop an articulate language has been, since the origin of man's capacity to think about himself, at the centre or heart of the human phenomenon. We know how structural linguistics has managed, in order to enrich anthro- pology, to change this fact into a method. But even the enlarge- ment of linguistics into a semiotics (or semiology) as a science of signs generally leaves intact the premises of "man's unique- ness in matters of language." Now here are experiments and observations that seem to have rendered comparative ethology capable of offering linguistics the services it has offered all the human sciences. To establish that in prehistory tool making is always con- temporary with speech (Leroi-Gourhan 1964, 1974) and to add (Kortlandt 1973 among others) that these two activities develop jointly only in rather large societies with quite varied economic activity is no longer to deny interest in the observa- tions of a Jane Goodall on a beginning of tool making among monkeys or criticism, with a view to clarification, of the latent epistemology of experiments with teaching various languages to various animals. Thus the human sciences are all the better integrated as they sharpen their differences. A single epistemology inspires them: to distinguish the thresholds in the continuity of the evolution of life. In applying the methods of ethology to the observation of child and man, in bringing about the ethnologi- cal subversion which transforms the observed into the observer, in disclosing in the course of history the transformation of the human psyche (Meyerson 1947, Vernant 1966), the human sciences are about to realize the great epistemological project of Pieron (1959), Wallon (1973), and others: to constitute a truly genetic psychology which could account for the coexis- tence within man of what is still animal and what is no longer so. by RONALD DARE Department of Sociology and Anthropology, New Mexico State University, Box 3BV, Las Cruces, N.M. 88003, U.S.A. 19 ix 75 As Mounin implies, reluctance to be associated more with the apes than with the angels extends far beyond the Zeitgeist of theocentric students traumatized by introductory physical anthropology. Therefore, when he suggests that chimpanzees do not speak in their natural settings largely because those settings do not demand such elaborate communication, rather than because the animals simply cannot think, Mounin, although bucking historical consensus, is probably on the right theoretical track. A very similar situation seems to exist for ecologically induced food sharing within the primate order (Dare 1974), despite previous speculation that such behavior might not be a general primate capability. This brings us to the other thrust of Mounin's thesis, i.e., the alleged failure of researchers to define adequately, in terms of communication and language, which nonhuman capacities have actually been demonstrated by the chimpanzee experi- ments. Here I am not so sympathetic with Mounin. In the first place, I would suggest that, of the sixteen diagnostic features borrowed from Hockett (1963), only four (openness, displace- ment, interchangeability, and semanticity) are necessary to define language formally. The other features are simply prag- matic consequences of this definition. For example, duality (double articulation), which Mounin claims has not been ade- quately demonstrated in the chimpanzee experiments, is a very efficient way of translating meaning into a limited symbolic system without limiting the semantic potential of a language. Therefore, while not a necessary feature of language, it is prob- ably inevitable, given the constraints of memory and cognitive discrimination in a primate brain. Furthermore, I am inclined to agree with Thorpe (1972:36) that ASL does possess duality. Its system of "cheremes" sub- divides into arbitrary but stable hand configurations, place- ments, and actions which are combined into meaningful ele- ments. In addition, the work of Rumbaugh, Gill, and von Glasersfeld ( 1973) also illustrates duality. Each "lexigram" consists of symbols composed of different figure and color ele- ments, singly or in combinations. Therefore, even if duality 8 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES were a necessary criterion for language, it would have been adequately demonstrated in the work already done. To reiterate, if communication (as defined by Mounin) is to be considered language, then that communication must have the capacity for (1) producing totally new but under- standable messages (openness), (2) referring to concepts beyond the perceptual field of the communicators (displacement), (3) allowing any communicator to be either transmitter or receiver (interchangeability), and (4) denoting meaning (semanticity). Any communication system which does all of this would prob- ably display other features, such as specialization, arbitrariness, discreteness, etc., in order to function, but if a system somehow existed without these additional features it would still be a language. Reynolds (1970:388) once stated, "codes that possess these properties [displacement and semanticity] are here defined as referential or symbolic. Washoe's performance qualifies as an example of the referential use of signs." It is also abundantly clear in the many published research reports that interchange- ability (between chimps and humans) and openness (in coin- ing new terms and "sentences") are definite components of the systems already used for ape-human communication. The very interesting movie "The First Signs of Washoe" (Nova television series) clearly documents these features as well. Finally, recent work by Gardner and Gardner (1975) addresses Mounin's justifiable concern over what he considers the relatively weak social ambience in Premack's laboratory and in the nonfluent ASL environment of Washoe. Neonatal chimpanzees are now being taught ASL by humans, some of them deaf, who are fluent in signing. This provides the infant chimps with a much richer social environment, in terms of ASL, and some preliminary but promising results indicate early signing by chimps equivalent to the developmental rate of signing among humans. by MARC R. FELDESMAN Department of Anthropology, Portland State University, P.O. Box 751, Portland, Ore. 97207, U.S.A. 2 ix 75 Mounin is to be applauded for this much needed and timely analysis of the experiments with Washoe and Sarah. It would have been instructive if he had also included some discussion of the experiments with Lana at Yerkes, since this represents still a third approach to some of the problems raised in the research of the Gardners and the Premacks. Mounin quite correctly takes the Gardners and especially the Premacks to task for their numerous errors in logic and lapses in epistemological rigor. There is little to fault in Mounin's essay; however, I would like to expand further one of his points regarding the Premack study. The Premacks (1971a, 1972) state that their goal is to answer the fundamental question "What is language?" They assume a priori a distinc- tion between language as a general system (of communication?) and the human form of language. In making this distinction they seemingly equate or confuse "language" with "communi- cation." They state (1972:92, emphasis added): "it is now well known that many other animals have elaborate communica- tion systems of their own. It seems clear that language is a general system of which human language is a particular, albeit re- markably refined, form." In this context it is difficult to deter- mine whether "language" and "communication" are syn- onyms, or whether the Premacks are uncertain about the meaning of either term in the context used. Later they state (p. 92): "If... an ape can be taught the rudiments of human language, it should clarify the dividing line between the gen- eral system and the human system." Premack (1971a) offers a list of "exemplars" required to establish evidence of language. Regrettably, it is not clear whether "language" here refers to the general system, the human system, or communication in general. To compound this difficulty, most of the exemplars are directly associated with the human language. (To my knowledge, neither the honeybee nor the dolphin, both of which meet the requirements of an "elaborate communication system," has a copula, asks questions. or uses sentences.) If we assume, however, that the exemplars refer to the "general system," then the Premacks fall squarely into the logical morass they have sought to avoid. By characterizing language as a general system of which human language is a refined form, and by characterizing this "general system" in almost exclusively human terms, they complete the circle. They have done what Piaget (1971) warned against: they have interpreted and de- fined the phenomena by recourse to the concept under analysis and have simply classified attributes of those phenomena. It is little wonder that Mounin questions their logic. I suspect that the results of these studies are (and will be) more important from a psychological and biological perspec- tive than from the linguistic or semiologic viewpoint. Neither study seems to have accomplished its goals. Both experiments do, however, add to the wealth of evidence regarding the in- tellectual capabilities and the capacity for learning of the chimpanzee and are, in this regard, a triumph in comparative psychology. They further add weight to the growing body of biochemical and genetic (King and Wilson 1975), morpho- logical and behavioral (Washburn 1968), and phyletic (Sarich 1974) evidence indicating that the evolutionary distance be- tween Pan and Homo is remarkably small. They do not (and probably cannot), however, offer any answer to Premack's (1971a: 808) fundamental question: What is language? by DON HANDELMAN Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Hebrew University of jterusalem, jerusalem, Israel. 29 viii 75 I quite agree with Mounin's criticisms and conclusions. To date we have no reason to think that the meaning of com- munication can be separated from the context of its expression, at least in human studies. This leads to the one point on which I should like to know more of Mounin's thinking. Mounin notes that Washoe was almost always the receiver, and almost never the transmitter, in her contacts with humans. Following Kortlandt, he suggests that the organization of chimpanzee society may place a low premium on communica- tion. In addition, Washoe's human masters were not fluent transmitters in ASL, and attempts to communicate with Washoe occurred in the "formal" context of the ongoing experi- ment. Still, outside the formal definition of the experiment, Washoe did try to communicate, as transmitter, with other chimpanzees and with dogs. Why, then, did she not take the initiative with humans within the experimental context? Sociocultural anthropologists have noted that the social statuses of persons in interaction affect the role allocations of transmitter and receiver, those of higher status tending to initiate and dominate interaction, especially in contexts that stress the formal presence of higher status. Might Washoe's lack of transmission to humans indicate some awareness on her part that she occupies an inferior position to humans, within a context that is formally unlike those in which she interacts with other animals? Writing of Sarah, Mounin notes that cap- tivity and behaviorist conditioning make for "poor social rela- tions." Presumably this is also correct for Washoe, if to a lesser extent. I suggest that these "poor social relations" might in part reflect social-status differentiation, taken for granted by Vol. 17 * No. 1 * March 1976 9</page><page sequence="10">the experimenter but communicated on some level to the chimpanzee. Since communication between experimenter and chimpanzee is crude, social-status and life-control differences between them might help to stifle initiation of transmission by the animal. The chimpanzee might, however, attempt trans- mission toward other animals whose life-situations she per- ceives, again on some level of meaning, as analogous to hers. If the chimpanzee is capable of symboling, of some degree of abstraction, is there any reason that the social overtones of status should not be communicated in contacts between the animal and the experimenter? If status differentiation is com- municated, might it not limit the transmission initiatives of those in captivity in the presence of their controllers within a context that reinforces the status system? by GORDON W. HEWES Department of Anthropology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo. 80302, U.S.A. 3 viii 75 A major point in Mounin's paper is that the social and other environmental conditions of the various chimpanzee language experiments are in some ways more important for understand- ing how language-like behavior arises than many of the strictly linguistic details. In the case of pongids, it now appears that all three-chimpanzee, gorilla, and orang-possess sufficient cogni- tive capacity for simple language, provided that the language involves a suitable modality, such as the visual-manipulatory one common to all of the successful experiments so far. (For a useful recent account of ape language experiments, see Linden 1975.) Greater success with chimpanzees may be related to their built-in greater social propensities. It seems unlikely that pongid language can become self-sustaining without an en- vironment providing consistently rewarding results from lan- guage use, involving enhancement of rewards from social inter- action or through mediation of individual problem-solving. That use of language does enhance various kinds of cognitive activity has been shown in children and in some more limited work with the chimpanzee (Duane M. Rumbaugh, personal communication). In Homo sapiens, and possibly at an earlier stage of hominization, language became self-rewarding, com- ing to function in greeting and leave-taking, play, ritual, etc., even where it has little propositional or predicative purpose and where it has come to be a kind of substitute for primate allogrooming. Mounin also deals with the considerable effort by Premack to relate the experiments with Sarah to a more precise or basic definition of language. Keosian (1974:285) alludes to a similar compulsion among those concerned with the problem of the origin of life (biogenesis), where the notion of a sudden emer- gence of life from inanimate matter seems to focus on precise definitions of "life" and the setting forth of criteria which would enable laboratory workers to determine when it might be cre- ated artificially. More gradualist, evolutionary views of bio- genesis are less troubled by the issue of precise definition or criteria for "life," holding that it is rather meaningless to "draw a line between two levels of organization and to desig- nate all systems below as inanimate and all systems above as living." The problem of a minimal definition of "language," and how we can tell if it has been, so to speak, artificially cre- ated in the laboratory, seems analogous. by DELL HYMES Department of Folklore, University of Pennyslvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 19174, U.S.A. 7 viii 75 Mounin shows the necessity of interpreting "linguistic com- petence" as comprising features of use as well as of grammar. I certainly support his concluding comments. Obviously they bear on more than the comparison between man and other primates. Modern society is pervaded by assessments of ability that take place in circumstances which narrow or exclude the possibility that the need for social communication be satisfied. And preconceived commitment to "man's uniqueness in mat- ters of language" seems to me a striking feature of contem- porary anthropology and linguistics. The difference between "man" and man's primate kin is held to be radical, categorical; differences within mankind are held to be superficial, insignif- icant. It is as if it would be unthinkable, some sort of treason, to have man and man's primate kin linked on a continuum, as Mounin suggests, and to have mankind itself differentiated, perhaps even, with respect to some characteristics, differenti- ated in ways that call for contrast (within the parameters that link the cases and make contrast significant). I do not understand the motives for this, but it seems to me to direct energies along self-deceiving paths. In maintaining the given image of mankind, one may have a sense of con- tributing to a victory for mankind. But over primates? Are other primates assaulting us? What cherished right must we give up if chimpanzees can talk? Having survived Copernicus and Darwin, can mankind not survive a closer communicative kin- ship with animals that it may soon extinguish anyway? Surely a civilization, many of whose members every day depend for communication on a familiar cat or dog or bird, cannot be threatened by experimenters communicating with apes? I suspect that this strange continuity with the "warfare between science and theology," this concern to save ''man" as others sought to save the Bible and the Bible's God, serves to divert attention from issues of communication that do threaten mankind. I suspect that it is somehow comforting to be concerned with "man," discomforting to be concerned with "men." Real problems of communication, of inequality in communicative rights and opportunities and, in the event, abilities, involve social and political domination. By reiterating that all men are in principle potentially equal, one may seem to strike a blow against inequality and prejudice. But one only changes the form in which prejudice can be expressed; one does nothing about the actuality of inequality. Only close analysis of situations, open to finding actual inequality, can provide a basis for transforming the social forces that breed it. Only work able to recognize that some aspects of inequality are inherent in diversity of cultural tradition, organization of social life, and biological individuality can pinpoint the causes and cures of remediable inequality, can project realizable alternatives to the present social order. Defense of the unique- ness of man in matters of language, and of its twin, homo- geneity, may protect a faith, but is largely a diversion, an intel- lectual counterpart of other spectacles by which the hegemony of the present order is unwittingly maintained. by VYACHESLAV IVANOV Moscow, U.S.S.R. 12 ix 75 The idea of teaching a chimpanzee the sign language of deaf- mutes was suggested by Vygodsky in a work written in 1929- 30 but published 30 years later. He compared the intellectual processes in chimpanzees to human prelinguistic intellect as studied in cases of aphasia (Vygodsky 1960:426-27). This idea might be confirmed by the recent data on the link between the right hemisphere and nonlinguistic behavior. The role of social collaboration within the group, discussed by Mounin, was studied by Yerkes, who showed that elementary sign- gestures might be developed by a group of young chimpanzees as a by-product of collective problem-solving (Yerkes and Nissen 1939; Yerkes 1943:171-80). In the cases of Washoe and Sarah one might see the experi- 10 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES ment of teaching an ape living in a human group an artificial system of communication; these cases are the reverse of the well-known cases in which a human child has remained speechless while living in a group of animals. The small num- ber of signs (not exceeding 2.102) in the ape artificial gestural systems is still close to the average number of phonemes. Thus the main distinction between ape systems of communication and those of human beings lies not in the number of the ele- mentary signals but in the multilevel principle of organization (Ivanov 1974). by GERARD KAHN Department of French, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada V6T 1W5. 10 ix 75 La question soulevee par Mounin, meme si elle n'est pas nouvelle, est parfaitement d'actualite et trouve dans les experiences des Gardners et des Premacks un developpement qui merite en effet d'etre largement commente. II apparalt toutefois que l'article tombe dans les pieges epistemologiques qu'il denonce, ceux du cercle vicieux oCu il s'enferme a la n. 2 qui definit la terminologie employee: signifies et signifiants. Elle conduit de surcroft I'auteur a un traitement quelque peu archa-que, malgre les appels ulterieurs a la semiologie. Quoi qu'en dise Mounin, les pronoms sont, tant du point de vue descriptif que distinctif, et jusqu'a preuve du contraire, un universel, et on voit mal pourquoi les universaux de Hockett devraient seuls etre pris en consideration. II est particuliere- ment desinvolte de reprocher a Benveniste d'avoir obscurci le probleme, alors meme qu'il s'agit d'une de ses contributions les plus importantes a la linguistique contemporaine, surtout lorsque cette critique a recours a l'argument du stade du miroir de Lacan (1949), qui a maintes fois repete son accord avec les vues de Benveniste (1951 ) sur la question des pronoms. Une meilleure lecture de Benveniste (1951) eviterait par ailleurs l'affirmation selon laquelle ((donner)) est "the simplest and most familiar of all social relations." Et l'aspect social du probleme, dont Mounin traite avec penetration, gagnerait a ne pas etre ((obscurci)) par une affirmation aussi vague que "as Karl Marx stressed." Quant a l'anthropomorphisme resolu des linguistes appeles a se pencher sur la question de la com- munication animale, n'est-il pas le corollaire legitime du caractere-meme de toute experience de ce genre? [The question raised by Mounin, although not new, is quite topical and is developed in the Gardners' and Premacks' experiments in a way which deserves to be thoroughly exam- ined. Nevertheless, it appears that the article falls into the very epistemological traps it denounces, those of the vicious circle in which it gets caught in n. 2, which defines the terminology used: signified and signifiers. Moreover, this leads the author to a somewhat outdated treatment, in spite of later references to semiology. Pronouns are, in spite of what Mounin says, and until proven otherwise, a universal both from the descriptive and from the distinctive point of view, and it is not clear why Hockett's universals alone should be considered. It is par- ticularly offhanded to reproach Benveniste with having ob- scured the question, when it is in this field that he has made one of his most important contributions to modern linguistics, especially when the criticism resorts to the argument of Lacan's (1949) mirror stage: Lacan has many times reiterated his agreement with Benveniste's views on the question of pro- nouns (Lacan 1973-). Furthermore, a better reading of Ben- veniste (1951) would have prevented the statement that "to give" is "the simplest and most familiar of all social relations." And the social aspect of the problem, with which Mounin deals with some insight, would benefit from not being "ob- scured" by so vague a statement as "as Karl Marx stressed." As for the resolute anthropomorphism of those linguists who have studied the question of animal communication, isn't it the best-founded corollary of the very nature of this kind of experimentation?] by ADAM KENDON Department of Anthropology, Australian National University, Box 4, P.O., Canberra, A.C. T. 2600, Australia. 4 ix 75 Mounin's critique of the Washoe and Sarah experiments makes clear the extreme anthropocentrism of their conception. By setting up the features of human language-however defined -as criteria against which the performances of Washoe and Sarah are to be assessed, as Mounin shows, the investigators have, in effect, begged the very question their experiments were designed to deal with. His critique suggests how pre- Darwinian in conception these experiments are, built, as they appear to be, upon the presupposition that the human species is at the top of some scala naturae, the standard against which all else is measured. The semiological question Mounin poses, in contrast, invites us to take a truly comparative approach. By asking, simply, for the nature of the communication system established between Washoe and Sarah and their respective mentors, we are freed from any evaluation and can thus examine what is going on and compare this with what goes on in other communication systems, for example, human ones. Within this perspective, then, it is the apparently rare instances where spontaneous informative utterance has occurred that have the greatest significance. Yet, as Mounin says (though perhaps does not emphasize enough), even these observations cannot be fully assessed until we know far more than we do about the communication systems wild chimpanzees make use of. It will make a great deal of difference to any hypothesis we might develop concerning the origin of language, for instance, whether Washoe's apparent capacity for informative utter- ance is a consequence of her association with humans or is something she (and her kind) are capable of and make use of in their natural state. Mounin's comments to me represent an important contribu- tion to the revision of our approach to human language which is currently under way, a revision which is leading us to see language as a wholly natural phenomenon, to be accounted for in terms of biological principles. I am intrigued by the fact that it should be a humanist such as Mounin, and not an ethologist, who should show us the outmoded nature of the paradigm in terms of which these otherwise highly sophisticated and technically advanced studies have been framed. by J. KITAHARA-FRISCH Sophia University, Kioicho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, jtapan. 1 1 ix 75 Mounin is one of the first linguists to comment at length on the recent attempts to elicit gestural language in captive chimpanzees, and for this reason his article deserves careful consideration by both anthropologists and psychologists. Of particular importance, because seldom mentioned in past dis- cussions, are his remarks on (1) the need to define rigorously con- cepts such as communication and language, (2) the greater signifi- cance, in Washoe's behavior, of rare but well-observed in- stances of spontaneous signing, as against her more publicized Vol. 17 N No. 1 * March 1976 11</page><page sequence="12">use of signs identified as nouns, adjectives, pronouns, or even her ability to combine these in a regular order, and (3), simi- larly, the significance of Sarah's spontaneous ordering of objects or signs when alone, following the models she had just learned. Mounin shows these spontaneous behaviors (if they are indeed granted to be such) to raise questions of great interest to an- thropologists. May not one see in them a transition from simple communication to self-expression? On the critical side, while acknowledging the technical per- fection of the Washoe and Sarah experiments, Mounin formu- lates more clearly than has been done so far questions pertain- ing to the methods used. Chief among them is that of deciding whether these experiments represent more than very complex cases of conditioning (dressage in French). In my view, only a closer study of the context of so-called spontaneous signing and ordering will answer this question. The detailed records kept by the Gardners would here prove invaluable. A question hardly touched upon by Mounin-and this is surprising in a linguist-regards the Anglocentric character of the problems raised by the Gardners and the Premacks. To a non-Western anthropologist, the signing by Washoe and the sign-ordering by Sarah so much reflect the linguistic structure of English, or of the Indo-European languages in general, that one wonders to what extent this similarity reflects the imitation by the chimpanzees of their American teachers and to what extent it simply suggests that the psychologists have imposed English structures on the chimpanzee's signing. The question could be answered by having non-Western psychologists repeat the Sarah and Washoe experiments and compare their results with those of the Gardners and the Premacks. Mounin's concluding paragraph comes somewhat as a sur- prise, and I, for one, fail to see how his very strict definition of human communication and his expressed doubts regarding the existence in Sarah and Washoe of a type of communication distinct from mere training allow him to claim a belief in the possibility of an "uninterrupted chain of types of communica- tion ... between animal and man." by SHELDON KLEIN Computer Sciences Department, Linguistics Department, University of Wisconsin, 1210 W. Dayton St., Madison, Wis. 53706, U.S.A. 16 ix 75 I would like to comment on Sarah, viewing her as a computer program, or as an automated logical device. From a compu- tational viewpoint, the most significant feature of natural lan- guage is the presence of ambiguity at every level that can be resolved only by the context of a complex text and structure of the world. The maintenance of a natural language in a speech community requires that its users be capable of resolving its ambiguities. This is especially a necessary condition for lan- guage transmission. Our own work on automated language learning (Klein and Kuppin 1970, Klein 1973, 1975) is based on creating a com- puter learning model that has more powerful inferential de- vices than a human but can be tuned down to simulate a human's weaker powers. Every item of Sarah's learning be- havior is explainable in terms of actual and projected mecha- nisms of our learning programs. There is also indication that Sarah used more powerful logical inference devices than Premack recognized. Sarah's use of negation and implication suggests the pro- positional calculus (other operators can be derived from these). Her use of the quantifiers "all," "one," "several," and "none" suggests that she has control of facets of the first-order predicate calculus. Of major significance is her ability to handle meta- language, to use information about the structure of the lan- guage to modify and extend the language itself. This ability touches upon aspects of the second-order predicate calculus. These features Premack recognizes implicitly. Machine learning programs are notoriously input-sequence- sensitive. For language-learning programs, this means that the form of the learned grammar is a function of the order of the training inputs. What psychologists call "transference" is, in our machine learning model, the synthesis of grammar rules with more general implications than just the content of the training inputs. Such general rules are actually easier for the program to learn than rigorously specific ones. Premack's (1971a) attempt to teach Sarah "is" is of funda- mental interest here. First, he does not seem to have taken account of the fact that "is" in English represents several different semantic concepts, including class equivalence as well as class inclusion (properties such as "red," "round," etc., may be viewed as classes). Premack's description of Sarah's use of "is" seems to be concerned only with the class-inclusion usage ("Red is not a shape," "Round is not a color"). Accordingly, Premack's use of "is" was intended to convey the notion of in- clusion of one class concept in another class concept. Sarah had earlier been trained, however, with the meta-concept "name-of" (" 'Apple' is the name of apple," " 'Banana' is not the name of apple"). Our automated inference device might attempt to assign "name-of" and "is" to some higher-level uni- fying concept. In this context, "is" is used ambiguously. We might therefore consider the possibility that Sarah's difficulty stemmed from her perception of the sentence "Red is shape" as meaning " 'Red' and 'shape' are names of classes." This seems to be a rather sophisticated assumption, and yet, in our automated learning model, it is an easy generalization to make because of the earlier experience with "name-of." If Sarah had generalized in this fashion, her difficulty with Premack's re- quired answers for "is" can be explained. Sarah was required to revise an existing general rule to a context-dependent rule for discriminating between a kind of class equivalence and a class-inclusion concept. To complicate matters, the situation had an inhdrent ambiguity that is usually absent in computer- language statements: Premack did not provide overt markers to differentiate between metalanguage statements and object- language statements. Accordingly, Sarah was faced with the problem of learning the correct semantic parsing mode from extended context. My somewhat circular tactic of viewing Sarah in terms of a computer model for simulating human language acquisition suggests that she has functioned as a more sophisticated logic machine than Washoe and manifested traces of all the abilities necessary for human language acquisition (ignoring phonology). Yet, I am not ready to infer that chimpanzees have this ability. Our work on automated language learning as a group phenom- enon (Klein 1974, Klein and Rozencvejg 1975) suggests that more complex experiments are necessary. Because input train- ing sequences condition the form of the learned grammar, no two individuals in a speech community ever have precisely identical grammars. Grammar similarity is controlled by the occurrence of classes of similar training inputs for individuals in similar social roles (the basis of sociolinguistics) and by the need to understand each other. The members of a speech com- munity must be able to parse and resolve the ambiguities in each other's speech productions. The actual grammars learned are a function of the net acceptance and rejection of produc- tions, by other members of the community, as a function of ease in semantic parsing. A human-chimpanzee generation- parsing interaction is not the same as chimpanzee-chimpanzee interaction. Could a community of chimpanzees sustain the sophistication of generation and parsing manifested in the laboratory human-chimpanzee interaction? A laboratory test is conceivable, but it might require supplying a laboratory test community of chimpanzees with a contrived "sociocultural" 12 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES structure that would make learning and use of the complex linguistic mechanisms important to the animals. by JONATHAN H. KRESS Box 973, Hillsborough, N.C. 27278, U.S.A. 2 ix 75 I congratulate Mounin on his cogent and incisive analysis of the work of the Gardners and the Premacks. It should finally lay to rest the three great logical inconsistencies that have defeated thinkers on the subject of language in its evolutionary perspective from White (1949) to Lieberman (1973): (a) the circular argument that language is human and therefore, etc., (b) the idea that universal characteristics constitute prerequi- sites, and (c) the idea that extensive description equals defini- tion. The direction of attention away from "language" towards "systems of communication" should also clear the air for fur- ther productive analysis, but I feel the term "language" is so prevalent and so important that it must eventually be defined in a way consistent with this relatively new data. I find Mounin's hesitancy on two aspects of chimp communi- cation somewhat unnecessary. Doubts about the frequency with which experimental subjects acted as the initiators should in part be allayed by the experiments of Rumbaugh (1973). It seems to me the demonstrated ability to initiate communica- tion is more important than the frequency with which it is employed, at least in the context of this analysis. Secondly, the various films of Marler and Goodall appear to contain nu- merous examples of "signals or signs explicitly directed towards a receiver." I think the question of training is another red herring. It would become critical only if the issue of the cognitive pro- cesses underlying human language and its acquisition were a settled one-if there were, for example, definitive reasons for rejecting behaviorist models in favor of a Chomskyan model. What the experiments have to my mind unquestionably demonstrated is the remarkable ability of chimps (and per- haps, more recently, even gorillas) to communicate with humans-an ability to transmit information that far exceeds anything ever witnessed in the wild. We as primatologists must now deal with the question of the relationship of this ability demonstrated in the laboratory to natural chimp communica- tion. It is logically comfortable to assume that the extraordinary performance of Washoe, Sarah, and others represents a simple extension of the same patterns of perception and cognition used by their wild relatives in their meager communications, but in the absence of a much more detailed analysis of the nature of both systems this assumption is unwarranted. Whatever the nature of this ability, we must also have some idea of its adap- tive significance. This knowledge would probably bring us a lot closer to an understanding of the history of human com- munication systems than we have ever been before. by ANDR?E LENTIN U.E.R. de .Mathe'matiques, Logique Formelle et Informatique, Universite' Rene' Descartes, 12, rue Cujas, 75005 Paris, France. 19 viii 75 D'accord avec Mounin sur l'essentiel: (a) critique des insuffi- sances (parfois surprenantes) des experimentateurs en matiere de linguistique; (b) necessite de se placer dans le cadre theorique plus large de la s6miologie et d'edifier une typologie des systemes de communication; (c) necessite absolue de provoquer chez l' animal des besoins reels de communication par l'en- richissement prealable puis concomitant des relations sociales. Ces theses ont des consequences importantes dont voici quelques unes: Certains systemes de communication existent prealablement a l'observation que nous en faisons, les uns pauvres ou em- bryonnaires (comme ceux, peut-etre, des chimpanzes sauvages), d'autres tres developpes (comme les langues naturelles). On peut essayer d'en faire la taxonomie, ce qui permettrait deja de mieux caracteriser le langage humain (cf. Mounin alinea 11). Mais les systemes qu'envisage Mounin (derniere phrase) sont a creer experimentalement. L'activite classificatoire ne s'exercerait plus seulement de l'exterieur mais s'integrerait a une activite de transformation. Or l'exp6rimentateur part necessairement d'un certain type de communication. (Dans le cas des experiences critiquees, c'etait-au moins en intention -celui relativement bien connu du langage humain.) Sur et par quels criteres choisirait-on et definirait-on ce type propose? Faudrait-il juger du type obtenu en fonction du type propose? Comment? (L'etude de Mounin contient quelques lineaments d'une telle methodologie.) Faudrait-il se donner la possibilite de modifier en cours d'experience le type propose? Constituerait-on un ensemble structure de types proposables? Travaillerait-on au contraire au coup par coup et par ajuste- ments successifs? La necessite s'imposerait d'une reflexion theorique poussee et prealable a toute experience pour avoir des resultats interpretables. Une remarque maintenant sur la ((pointe)) finale de Mounin: Les phenomenes de discontinuite et depassement existent tout comme les phenomenes de continuite. Quand les botanistes se demandent si la fleur des Angiospermes constitue ou non une nouveaute radicale par rapport a la fleur des Gymnospermes, ils ont l'esprit libre-mis a part leur amour-propre de savant. Si la typologie des systemes de communication obtenus pre- sentait une discontinuite manifeste, je suppose que tout scienti- fique digne de ce nom accueillerait ce fait sans se laisser influ- encer par de possibles ((applications apologetiques.)) [I agree with Mounin on the essential: (a) the critique of the weaknesses (sometimes surprising) of these experimenters in linguistics; (b) the necessity of adopting the broader theoretical framework of semiology and building a typology of communica- tion systems; (c) the absolute necessity of provoking in the animal a real need to communicate by a prior and concomitant enrichment of social relationships. These theses have important consequences, some of which are the following: Certain communication systems exist prior to the observation we make of them, some poor or embryonic (such as those, perhaps, of wild chimpanzees), others highly developed (such as natural languages). We could make a taxonomy of them that would allow a better characterisation of human language (cf. Mounin paragraph 11). The systems Mounin considers (last sentence), however, are to be experimentally created. The classification activity would not only take place from the out- side, but would be integrated into a transformation activity. But the experimenter necessarily starts from a certain type of communication. (In the case of the experiments criticized, it was-at least in intent-a relatively well-known type, that of human language.) By what criteria should this proposed type be chosen and defined? Must we judge the type obtained in terms of the type proposed? How? (Mounin's study contains some outlines of such a methodology.) Should there be a possibility of modifying the proposed type in the course of the experiment? Should one build an entire structure of types to be proposed, or should one, on the contrary, work step by step and through successive adjustments? Thorough theoretical re- flection prior to any experimentation would be necessary in order to obtain understandable results.

Ce milieu d'abord mineral, puis vegetal enfin animal se complexifie. Chez certaines especes, les individus s'organisent entre eux de maniere temporaire ou permanente pour mieux dominer ce milieu. Plus un groupe est socialise plus les relations s'intensifient, se diversifient et comptent d'elements de com- munication. Chez le Singe, la communication est affaire de relation de securite, de cohesion du groupe, d'education des jeunes... La communication n'est pas gratuite, elle apparait a propos de quelque evenement ou necessite biologique. Elle precede, accompagne ou ponctue une experience vecue. En cela elle se diff6rencie du langage qui tend a se substituer a un reel tangible. Toute syntaxe cautionne un rapport, toute communi- cation est rapport. Que pense Sarah de son jeu code de formes plastiques? Beaucoup de mots, du moins parmi les premiers enseignes, se referent a un objet alimentaire, a celui qui le mange (le Chimpanze), a celui qui le donne (l'experimentateur). I1 semble que Sarah accede aux propositions de Premack dans un vecu et non dans un substitut de vecu. Sarah accepte d'apprendre ce qu'il est indispensable de faire pour arriver a ses fins, ici d'abord manger mais aussi se faire accepter par le groupe, satisfaire sa curiosite... Quand on apprend au Singe "to give," c'est une perspective d'appropriation qui passe. Dans le protocole des Gardner, la syntaxe est reduisible a des experiences d'association et d'exclusion. Les tests proposes a Sarah sont plus difficiles (et aux dires de certains, des enfants humains ne seraient pas parvenus a les executer). Ces expe- riences seraient a reprendre, mais elles sont plausibles: des chiens savants sont capables de performances confondantes. Que conclure de ces experiences? Sinon qu'elles montrent que les capacites d'apprentissage des Chimpanzes sont telles que les elements intermediaires qui peuvent etre intercalles entre la suggestion de l'acte (par exemple, manger la pomme) et sa consommation sont multipliables et diversifiables presqu'a loisir. Rien n'autorise a voir dans ces comportements subtiles un debut d'abstraction, une amorce de langage, les premisses d'une hominisation. [Considered in evolutionary perspective, communication is only one aspect of an animal's relation to his milieu. This milieu, at first mineral, then vegetal, and finally animal, be- comes more and more complex. In certain species, individuals organize themselves, temporarily or permanently, in order bet- ter to dominate this milieu. The more a group is socialized, the more its relations intensify, diversify, and include elements of communication. In the ape, communication is a question of security, group cohesion, education of the young, etc. Communication is not gratuitous, but appears in reference to some biological event or necessity. It precedes, accompanies, or punctuates an actual experience. In this it differentiates itself from language, which aims at substituting itself for a tangible reality. All syntax guarantees a relation, all communication is relation. What does Sarah think of her game coded in plastic forms? Many of the words, at least among the first ones taught, refer to an alimentary object, to the one who eats it (the chimpanzee), or to the one who gives it (the experimenter). It seems that Sarah accedes to Premack's proposals in an actual experience and not in a substitute for this experience. Sarah is willing to learn what is indispensable in order to obtain what she wants-in this case something to eat, but also acceptance by the group, satisfaction of her curiosity, etc. An ape learns the concept "to give" when it is attached to the prospect of acquiring something. In the Gardners' protocol, syntax is reduced to experiences of association and exclusion. The tests proposed to Sarah are more difficult (and, according to some authors, human children would not succeed in executing them). These experiments should be taken up again, but they are plausible: even clever dogs are capable of baffling performances. What can be concluded from these experiments? Only that they demonstrate that the chimpanzee's learning capacities are such that the intermediary elements intercalated between the suggestion of the act (for example, to eat the apple) and its consummation are multipliable and diversifiable almost at will. Nothing authorizes us to see in these subtle behaviors the beginnings of abstraction, the rudiments of language, or the first-fruits of horninization.] by PHILIP LIEBERMAN Box E, Brown University, Providence, RI. 02912, U.S.A. 19 viii 75 The philosophical framework of the 18th century that makes language a unique, defining "human" attribute still unfortu- nately pervades linguistic theory. Humans have "language," animals communicate. Mounin correctly notes some of the problems that derive from trying to see if the communications of chimpanzees meet all the supposed "universals" of human language. The "universals" are themselves rather tentative hypotheses at best. Asking whether chimpanzees have lan- guage is pointless and silly when you've already restricted the scope of the word "language" to linguistic ability equivalent to that of present-day Homo sapiens. Chimpanzees clearly have neither the cognitive nor the linguistic ability of present-day hominids. It is evident, however, that human cognitive and linguistic ability evolved gradually in stages from early homi- nids who were in many ways closer to present-day chimpanzees than we are (Lieberman 1975). Studies of the communications of chimpanzees can lead to a better understanding of the basic elements, the "primitives" of early hominid language. The next stages in the study of chimpanzee language should explore its potential. We lack, for example, adequate analyses of their vocal communication, which on physiological grounds is potentially richer than has been noted in field studies. It also would be useful to find out how they transmit information without constraining the data with the syntax of the "uni- versal" language of transformational linguists (English) or us- ing experimental procedures that duplicate the social texture of solitary confinement or a maximum-security prison. As Mounin concludes, Cartesian presuppositions concerning the separation of man and animal can prevent us from testing the theory that is most productive, the existence of a gradual "chain of communication" (I'd use the word language) between other animals and man. by EUGENE LINDEN Box 176, NXorfolk, Conn. 06058, U.S.A. 15 IX 75 Like some French wines, the details of the Washoe and Sarah experiments do not seem to travel very well. Mounin makes a 14 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">-Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES few reportorial errors, at least one of which has bearing on his critique. He asserts that "the methodological failure of this approach, in the Washoe experiment, proceeds from the question 'Is there language?' in that it is logically not the first question that should be asked." Later he reiterates: "Above all, as was the case with the Gardners and Washoe, [Premack] committed a fundamental error of method by asking the ques- tion . . . whether or not one could speak of language." This criticism is unfair because, so far as I know, the Gardners have steadfastly refused to approach this question. Mounin asserts that human language is "already well de- fined" and that one should "speak of a 'system of communica- tion' whenever it has not been established whether a system contains all the defining features of human natural languages." As the Gardners have noted, however, language is not well defined; there is no consensus within the linguistic community on when an organism can be said to have it. Mounin says this himself when he says that Premack "should have systemati- cally tested the communication established by Sarah with every one of Hockett's 16 features, then with every one of the Chomskyan universals (a difficult task, as the list seems to be open), and last with every one of the features that philosophers and common belief assign to language properly speaking." Moreover, Mounin devotes a good deal of space to arguing the definitional importance of various aspects of language. It was this "polysemy of the word language" which dissuaded the Gardners from asking the question which Mounin claims is the first they asked. Mounin seems to endorse Hockett's evolving list of criteria for language and asserts that because "ASL does not comprise double articulation" there is no language in the Washoe experi- ment. However, it has not been settled whether or not ASL has duality of patterning. With regard to Mounin's other assertion-that there is no language because Washoe did not use ASL to lie or to convey information to other chimps- there is (unpublished) anecdotal evidence that she and other chimps have used it to deceive (although how one might struc- ture an experiment to establish the element of intention in lying is an imposing problem). Chimps have also used ASL to convey information to one another (Roger Fouts, personal communication, and Linden 1975:131). It seems that Mounin, like Bronowski and Bellugi (1970) before him, is being pre- mature in addressing the question of whether or not the ASL- using chimps have language. With regard to Premack, one has to agree with Mounin that to lose sight of the communicative functions of language is to lose a perspective on the functions and structures of human and nonhuman communication. In contrast, Washoe's spon- taneous exploitation of ASL to express thoughts or to converse with other chimps-and, as I have said, there have been more instances of such conversations than Mounin indicates-is the most powerful evidence that something more than mechanistic training is involved in the ASL experiments. One has to agree as well that these experiments show how nonscientific "ideological" factors deeply influence the be- havioral sciences. by KIYOKO MUROFUSHI Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484, Japan. 3 ix 75 The author's criticism of the work of Premack is quite accept- able. Because his choice of defining features for human language was not systematic, it is impossible to conclude that there was either language or communication between Sarah and her instructors. Regardless of this weakness, however, the contribu- tion of Premack's experiment in analyzing an important func- tion of language-the organization of experience-should not be underestimated. It is most regrettable, on the other hand, that no theoretical and methodological system for determining "what type of com- munication" is indicated from the author's point of view that "the primary and central function of language is to satisfy the need for social communication." His definition of "communica- tion (in the linguistic sense of the term, specifying human com- munication)" does not distinguish between general communi- cation and human communication (which may be considered a type of communication by the author). It seems to me important for the comparative study of com- munication to know what kind of agreement about the coding rules is shared between the transmitter and receiver and how that agreement is established before the communication. With- out any perspective on these questions, it will be impossible to get more informative data than we have at present, even if the communication between Washoe and other chimpanzees is observed in the way Mounin suggests. by EUCLID 0. SMITH rerkes Regional Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Ga. 30322, U.S.A. 1 VIII 75 Mounin's paper is another review of a timely topic of con- siderable interest to linguists, primatologists, anthropologists, et al. The author's efforts to define the sine qua non of language are of little utility, however, for in all likelihood there is a gradual continuum from a state of "no language" to a state of "facile language abilities." Failure to recognize this possi- bility forces categorization into a "have"-or-"have-not" di- chotomy. This categorization seems almost circular, as Mounin points out; however, he too seems to fall victim to his cautions. A more important point is the author's failure to review the work of Rumbaugh and his colleagues (e.g., Gill and Rum- baugh 1974; Rumbaugh et al. 1973a, b, 1974). Without ade- quate review of this outstanding research, efforts at evaluating language skills among chimpanzees are clearly limited. If it is useful to differentiate human language from other sys- tems of communication, consideration of Hockett and Ascher (1964) might be in order. Though Mounin details Hockett's work, he has ignored this most important paper. Finally, the author's failure to review germane field reports on communication in chimpanzees is troubling. Almost as an aside he notes that little work has been done to investigate communication in wild chimpanzees. Clearly, consideration of Goodall's and Marler's work in this area is in order. In sum, Mounin has introduced interesting theoretical points in assessment of language ability but has allowed himself to be entrapped in the obviously circular "language" vs. "no language" argument. A more careful literature review in cer- tain areas would add considerably to this paper. by HORST D. STEKLIS Department of Anthropology, Livingston College, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J. 08903, U.S.A. 5 IX 75 Mounin's essay makes a valuable contribution in specifying conceptual and methodological shortcomings in the work of the Gardners and the Premacks (curiously, Rumbaugh et al.'s work with Lana is nowhere mentioned) which have precluded definitive answers to the much asked question of whether apes Vol. 17 N No. I March 1976 15</page><page sequence="16">can acquire language (in the human sense) or are capable of "linguistic communication" (Mounin's terminology-and I fail to see his distinction with respect to language). Some of the issues discussed by Mounin (e.g., whether the results represent elaborate training or real symbolic communication) received critical treatment at a Neurosciences Research Program work session (Ploog and Melnechuk 1971), and similar uncertain conclusions were reached. It is clear now that, insofar as defini- tive answers to the question "can apes acquire language?" are to be forthcoming at all (and this will obviously depend on some future definitional consensus, rather than individual opinion, of what "language" is), they are likely to be found through multidisciplinary, collaborative, and, as Mounin points out, differently conceived research efforts in the labora- tory and field. I would like to elaborate on a point made by Mounin con- cerning research on gestural communication among feral social groups of chimpanzees. Chimpanzee gestures are readily shaped through imitation and social experience, at times resulting in the invention of novel display sequences (Van Lawick-Goodall 1973). This implies that, unlike vocalizations, gestures involve strong neocortical mediation; hence, American Sign Language is learned easily, whereas shaping of vocalizations is nearly im- possible. McNeill (1972) has drawn attention to the importance of relating features of Sarah's and Washoe's linguistic achieve- ments to aspects of chimpanzee social life in nature. He specu- lates that "free-ranging chimpanzees are already using a linguistic system based on social and personal interactions" (p. 24). Against this background, Mounin's query about whether chimpanzee gestures can be classified as explicitly directed signals is naive, and I direct his attention to the works of Van Lawick-Goodall (1968) and Van Hooff (1973) for examples of a "rough deciphering" (Mounin's expression) of the gestural system. Obviously, we are a long way removed from specifica- tion of a natural linguistic code, and we may hope that future field and laboratory research will pursue the kind of program McNeill has suggested. A final comment about native chimpanzee cognition and its neural correlates is in order. There is no a priori reason not to imagine a more sophisticated natural chimpanzee gestural communications system than was anticipated pre-Washoe. It seems far-fetched from an evolutionary standpoint to interpret their linguistic achievements in the laboratory in terms of a " 'bottled-up' intellectual capacity" (Hill 1972). Rather, it ap- pears more reasonable that the cognitive and neural basis for language evolved first in relation to other behaviors, with language as only one product (Fouts 1974). A recent critical review by Passingham and Ettlinger (1972) reveals that many of the structural specializations for human intellect and lan- guage (e.g., angular gyrus, relatively large frontal lobe, arcuate fasciculus), heretofore believed uniquely human, also charac- terize the brains of apes. Perhaps the real value of the chim- panzee language experiments lies in directing our attention, in a novel way, back to the naturalistic ape communications systems and other complex behaviors (e.g., tool use), as well as their neural correlates. by WILLIAM C. STOKOE Linguistics Research Laboratory, Gallaudet College, Kendall Green, Washington, D.C. 20002, U.S.A. 27 viii 75 Mounin thoughtfully relates language, communication, and the significance of two epochal experiments. A main point in his review- that the Washoe experiment is more important than the Sarah experiment because of its richer social relations -would gain force had he seen the copious evidence that a sign language can be digital as well as analogic (Stokoe 1960, 1965, 1969-70, 1970, 1972, 1974a, b, 1975), i.e., that ASL is doubly articulated (see Sign Language Studies 7 [1972], issues 1-7 passim, and especially Abbott's [1975] work showing that comparing encodedness is superior to asking "Language: yes or no?"). Mounin's preference for providing subject and experimenters more than Kortlandt's "very little to say to one another" allies him with anthropologists like Hewes, Kortlandt, Sarles, Steklis, and Washburn, who view communication and language as possible results, not conditions, of social relations and systems. Two statements, however, reveal uncertainty about chim- panzee society. To say "wild chimpanzees have a poor system of vocal calls" judges values more than quantifies (Marler 1975, Sarles 1974). A few sequences from Goodall's film record show wild chimpanzee calls fulfilling literal call function in dense jungle; once within sight, these social animals communicate by gesture-posture-action as well as by touch and sound. Mounin's statement that it would be very interesting to know "what means of communication wild chimpanzees possess" unnecessarily disregards good work. Primarily, sign languages serve social systems of deaf persons who use doubly articulated signs in human cultural settings (Sallagoity 1975). Because I find Mounin's general position on language and communication so sound, I am the more con- cerned by his lack of rapport with any sign-using human com- munity. Even in France, the venerable Institut National des Sourds-Muets has become L'Institut National des Jeunes Sourds. The British Deaf and Dumb Association has become the British Deaf Association. And in America, where ethnic and linguistic group consciousness runs high, for a speaker to call deaf persons "deaf-mutes" sets off the same vibration as for a White to call Black persons by terms in use a century ago. One positive effect of the Washoe (and Pili and Moja) experiment(s) should be noted here. Allen and Beatrice Gardner are unlikely to include it in comparative-psychology reports. As a consequence of their importing bright young native (deaf) signers as assistants and their own interacting with the com- munity, the deaf in Reno have a new sense of their language's worth, a feeling of pride in the experiments, and a new school which has not had to go through the linguistic chauvinism of former eras. by ROMAN STOPA 52/36 Mogilska, 30-960 Krako'w, Skr. 813, Poland. 3 ix 75 From the point of view of general linguistics and semiology, Mounin is conscientious in exploiting the data of the two linguistic experiments with chimpanzees, he is honest in dis- cussing sine ira et studio their scientific value, and his position of unprejudiced critic is praiseworthy. I hope I will do no in- justice to the highly valuable results of the Gardners and the Premacks if I add some remarks from the point of view of research on primitive languages and hence the study of the evolutionary aspect of language. For me it is not important to see if there is something like human language or communica- tion in Washoe's or Sarah's achievements. I consider it more constructive to see to what extent their communicative (not linguistic) behaviour, while being taught, reflected external conditions-how these conditions affected the chimpanzees' psycho-physiological structure. For these experiments to have been fruitful for the study of the origin and evolution of lan- guage, the living conditions of the chimpanzees should have been as natural as possible (the feasibility of this requirement has been shown by the observations of Van Lawick-Goodall and those of Yerkes and Learned). These conditions should be similar to those in which the Australopithecinae made their first steps towards creating language. In these first steps there 16 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES was no room for verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, or conjunc- tions, no room for three- or four-unit utterances. In the natural course of things, it took thousands of years to achieve the dis- tinction between verb and noun or the combination of three units in an utterance. At the beginnings of language, only one often-repeated gesture or gesture-like (clicking) syllable (ex- ceptionally two) was required to characterize the situation, of which this syllable was an integral part or supplement. The conditions of "speaking" in both experiments were far from being natural, and they were somewhat one-sided if there were always only two kinds of rewards to be expected (food or tickle). There are at least 11 tension- or emotion-laden situations, from fighting or tickling to delousing each other, that evoke different gestures, clicks, and sounds in chimpanzees (cf. Andrew [1964] on clicks in Lemuriformes). It is evident that the two experiments cannot offer examples of any functions of language besides the communicative one; the expressive and the true "organic" symbolic functions are absent. The chimpanzee's vocal-auditory canal-being some- what deficient in comparison with the human one-allows him to achieve a rough and global production of certain rudiments of our vowels a(e), o(u), nasals (m, n, '), and gutturals (kx', x, h, k) as well as of certain Bushman-like incomplete clicks (labial, dental, and lateral, but not palatal) and thus enables him to create the first sound synthesis, that of a consonantal element and a vocalic element (e.g., kx'a). In this synthesis, besides the respective gesture and mimicry, the expressive function (comprised chiefly by the vocalic element, as it is one of the symptoms of emotion) and the communicative one (con- tained mainly in the consonantal element, as it is directed outwards, i.e., to the hearer) evidently occur, but the symbolic one is impossible with the chimpanzee's equipment for gestures and sounds (clicks are used by the chimpanzee only as mono- phones, i.e., as incomplete sounds without any back, guttural, or nasal element). Gestures are too disparate means of com- munication to be connected with sounds. Therefore, it is only the clicks that can enter into the second semiological synthesis, as they are capable of being connected with the sounding syllable to objectify and symbolize the situation, e.g., /kx'a (which means in Bushman 'to grow, sprout' or something that grows like a branch of a tree, 'the hand'). I have here given some details of the chimpanzee's sound inventory so that they may be used in any future "linguistic" experiment. I think that since the Gardners succeeded in teach- ing a chimpanzee gestures reflecting the present-day situation, it should be feasible for any future experimenter to develop a chimpanzee's natural "language" by teaching him gestures and sounds originating in his own world (taking into account the situation of the Australopithecinae, as inferred from observations of free-living chimpanzees), in his own gesticula- tion and his own sound inventory. by D. JEAN UMIKER-SEBEOK Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies, Indiana Uni- versity, Bloomington, Ind. 47401, U.S.A. 10 ix 75 Mounin is correct in asserting that "the criteria for human language ... must be sought through a compartive ... study of all systems of communication, including animal communica- tion" rather than through generalization of its present charac- teristics. We have ample evidence, some of which is brought forth in the article in question, that, without a comparative, semiotic perspective, discussions of such experiments as those conducted by the Gardners and the Premacks can never hope to offer more than tentative, incomplete, and usually impres- sionistic conclusions. To be useful in solving the type of problem dealt with here, the semiotic theory adopted must be one, like that of Peirce (1965-66), which is of sufficient scope as naturally to encompass, on the one hand, animal sign behavior and, on the other, the more highly developed signs of man, such as propositions and arguments. Mounin, while advocating a broad perspective, accepts the semiotic theory of the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, a theory notorious, at least outside French-speaking countries, for its preoccupation with human signs, particularly spoken language. This leads him to define communication in terms which preclude the serious considera- tion of nonhuman sign data. I refer specifically to two of his four criteria for "communication"-"(b) the transmitter must be aware that his target is the receiver" and "(c) the receiver must be aware of being the transmitter's target." The presence of an "intention to communicate" or to exchange messages, while unavoidable in the analysis of some (and by no means all) types of communication between humans, can be determined only through verbal questioning of interactants or by intro- spection, both obviously unavailable to the honest observer of animal behavior, not to mention the prelinguistic behavior of human infants. The second disturbing aspect of Mounin's semiotic approach is that it reduces a consideration of sign behavior to communi- cation, thus largely ignoring the equally important semiotic issue of representation. It is not at all clear to me, as it appears to be to Mounin, that "the primary and central function of language is to satisfy the need for social communication." No one would wish to doubt that social relationships, or different communicative pressures, exert a powerful influence on the semiotic behavior of all living organisms, as Mounin maintains. But to suggest, as he does, that language evolved in man and not in the chimpanzee because of differences in the level of complexity of social relations in the two species is an over- simplification of the problem. Mounin seems to have little acquaintance with the existing studies of natural chimpanzee social behavior (e.g., to cite only two, Goodall 1965 and Van Lawick-Goodall 1971), which reveal an astonishingly subtle and intricate pattern of social roles and statuses at play in a chimpanzee group. How can we be certain that, when language first evolved, human societies were not based on similar types of relations? In fact, in what is certainly one of the most important discussions published so far about the chimpanzee experiments, but which Mounin does not mention, McNeill (1974) has shown that what Washoe's signing exhibited was precisely an appreciation of certain subtle social relationships between the chimp and the men and ani- mals around her, while failing to show an appreciation of the power of the signs used to model the physical world in a propo- sitional manner. It is still open to question whether Premack was able to overcome his chimp's natural predilection to ignore, at least semiotically, objects in the physical world in order to induce her to produce propositional strings of signs. McNeill claims that he has, albeit only after a rigorous, highly artificial training program, and only in a restricted sense (Sarah could negate but not question). Others (e.g., Sebeok 1975), including Mounin, are more hesistant about ruling out the possibility that Sarah's performance was actually an example of an ex- tremely sophisticated trick learning. Whatever the outcome of future attempts to continue or replicate the Washoe and Sarah experiments, the crucial issue to be resolved has certainly shifted, as Mounin avers, from the presence or absence of ad hoc lists of language "universals" in the behavior of nonhuman primates. But, as I have tried to show, Mounin's substitution of the question "Is there com- munication?" for the traditional "Is there language?" would not sufficiently advance the quest for the distinctive semiotic features of man, at least as he frames that question. We need to know, in addition to whether there is a potential for the Vol. 17 N No. I March 1976 17</page><page sequence="18">exchange of messages, what types of objects and relations are represented in those messages. Reply bv GEORGES MOUNIN De6partement de Linguistique Generale, Universite de Provence, 29, Avenue Robert Schuman, 13 Aix-en-Provence, France. 12 x 75 L'article soumis a la discussion etait uniquement destine a attirer l'attention des diverses branches de l'anthropologie sur les possibilites que peuvent leur offrir la linguistique et la semiologie lorsqu'il s'agit d'analyser des faits, ou de poser et de resoudre des problemes concernant la communication animale. Les 22 commentaires qui viennent s'ajouter a l'article constitu- ent une contribution qui augmente beaucoup l'int6ret qu'il pouvait pr6senter, par leurs additions, leurs complements et leurs enrichissements. Si je n'ai pas inclus l'experience de Rumbaugh avec Lana, comme le soulignent divers commentateurs (Dare, Feldesman, Ivanov, Kress, Smith, Steklis), c'est parce que je n'ai pas acheve l'analyse s6miologique de cette experience, et que la collaboration entre linguistes ou semiologues et anthropologues demande une grande attention pluridisciplinaire, comme le prouvent toutes les interventions ci-dessus. Je n'ignore pas les travaux de Jane van Lawick-Goodall (Kendon, Kress, Smith, Steklis, Umiker-Sebeok). Je les estime tres importants. Je pense qu'ils prouvent qu'il y a communica- tion chez les chimpanzes sauvages. Mais je pense aussi que le systeme de cette communication (appels + comportements) n'est pas actuellement decrit, ni peut-etre pas encore decrivable d'un point de vue semiologiquement satisfaisant. Je n'ignore pas non plus les diff6rentes versions de la re- cherche de Hockett (y compris avec Ascher), et contrairement a ce que croient Kahn et Linden je ne les prends pas a mon compte. Je signale simplement qu'ils fournissaient depuis longtemps une bonne base epistemologique et theorique aux problemes pos6s par la communication animale, et qu'on ne les a pas assez utilis6s systematiquement, ni discutes reellement. Les problemes souleves par Kahn restent marginaux: meme si les pronoms sont un universel linguistique (au sens chomskyen), ce qui n'est pas siur, ils ne constituent pas un trait d6finitoire obligatoire du langage. Le fait que Lacan ait dit son accord avec la subjectivit6 des pronoms chez Benveniste ne prouve rien, etant donne que le th6oricien et l'ecrivain sont chez lui bien moins rigoureux que le clinicien. Le probleme est de savoir si le stade du miroir precede le stade du je, et si ce stade du miroir indique objectivement chez l'enfant une prise de conscience de son individualite-ce qui est indiscute. La cita- tion de Marx est celebre; elle est dans l'Ide'ologie allemande (cf. Mounin 1972:225-52, et notamment 231). J'ai apprecie la reponse de Stokoe dont je connais aussi les travaux tres originaux, et tres necessaires, sur la double articu- lation de I'ASL. Mais je ne suis pas persuade que I'ASL offre la duality of patterning du langage naturel humain doublement articule, pour les memes raisons que j'ai developp6es a propos du langage gestuel des Indiens d'Amerique (v. n. 9 ci-dessus; v. aussi Mounin [1970: 135-48] sur le puzzling problem de la double articulation dans l'ecriture et dans les symboles mathe- matiques, problemes tres voisins de celui de Stokoe). Concernant le silence relatif de Washoe et son explication par la perception qu'elle aurait eue de son statut social inferieur (Handelman), il faut etre pret a accueillir toutes les donnees qui seront fournies sur ce point, de meme que sur le caractere self-rewarding de la communication au niveau des chimpanzes 6duques par l'homme (Hewes). L'objection essentielle contre les theses proposees par l'article reside dans le probleme de la definition de ce qui est langage (humain?) et de ce qui est communication (animale?). Ce probleme serait artificiel (Hewes), sans interet (Steklis), sans importance (Stopa) ou mal pos6 (Umiker-Sebeok). A mon avis, les primatologistes, les 6thologistes, les anthropologistes ont raison d'apprecier d'abord la richesse des faits apport6s, la finesse des descriptions recentes, l'importance des problemes anthropologiques soulev6s. Mais ceci n'enleve rien-et c'est la que le semiologue intervient-a la necessite, posterieurement, de classer et de hierarchiser tout ce qu'on a trouve sous le nom de comportement social, de communication, de langage, afin d'en comprendre la signification anthropologique exacte. Aucun physicien n'accepterait de dire que les differences de temperature et de pression qui creent les vents, que les batte- ments de coeur, que les moteurs a explosion et les turbo- reacteurs font partie de la grande classe des ph6nomenes ((createurs de mouvement)), et qu'il est inutile de rechercher les diff6rences physiques profondes entre ces phenomenes, sans doute plus importantes que leur appartenance commune a la m6canique. Toutes les autres objections sont stimulantes, mais non toutes convaincantes. I1 est certain qu'il faut etre tres exigeant lorsqu'on demontre qu'un animal est capable d'abstraction et de symbolisation; mais, meme dans le cadre d'un apprentissage sophistique, le fait que Washoe associe le meme signe gestuel a toutes les brosses a dents, on que Sarah associe le meme carre rouge a toutes les pommes, est un fait de meme nature que l'association par l'homme du mot ((cheval)) a toutes les occurrences de CHEVAUX dans son experience vecue. I1 est certain aussi, comme le dit Klein, que le maniement du symbole/verbe ((etre))/ chez Sarah presente un grand interet pour tout ce que Piaget appellerait la construction des relations logiques praxiques, ou operatoires. Mais ceci ne change rien au fait que le verbe o8tre)) n'est pas un universel necessaire a la definition du langage. L'analyse de Klein, ici, n'annule pas les observations de Kitahara-Frisch sur les dangers de l'anglo- centrisme. Enfin, meme sije pense (avec Feldesman et Kitahara- Frisch) que les travaux actuels conduisent plut8t peut-etre vers l'idee d'une gradation continue entre les diverses formes successives de communication animale et le langage humain, que vers l'idee d'une coupure radicale entre les deux, je precise dans ma conclusion qu'il faut se sentir libre d'accepter la reponse qu'on trouvera a la question, quelle qu'elle soit- mais fond6e sur de bonnes raisons. Tout mon travail a tendu a suggerer que des travaux comme ceux de Hockett, de Martinet, de Prieto, sur les caracteres specifiques des codes non-linguistiques, ont ete trop peu utilis6s dans un domaine oui ils pourraient apporter beaucoup. Puis-je rep6ter que, jusqu'ici, il me semble que les linguistes et les s6miologues ont fait plus d'efforts pour apprendre la langue et pour assimiler les donnees des ethologistes et des anthropologues, que ceux-ci n'en ont fait pour assimiler les apports de la linguistique et de la semiologie? Les discussions provoquees par l'article ci-dessus voulaient etre pour les uns et les autres le commencement d'une meilleure frequentation reciproque. [The article under discussion was intended simply to draw to the attention of various branches of anthropology the possi- bilities that linguistics and semiology might offer them in the analysis of facts or the posing and resolving of problems in animal communication. The 22 comments that accompany the article greatly augment the interest that it could have presented with their additions, complements, and enrichments. If I did not include Rumbaugh's experiment with Lana, as several commentators (Dare, Feldesman, Ivanov, Kress, Smith, Steklis) note, it is because I have not completed a semiological 18 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Mounin: LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, CHIMPANZEES analysis of that experiment, and because collaboration between linguists or semiologists and anthropologists demands a great deal of multidisciplinary attention, as the above contributions prove. I am not unaware of the works of Jane van Lawick-Goodall (Kendon, Kress, Smith, Steklis, Umiker-Sebeok). I consider them very important. I think that they prove that there is communication among wild chimpanzees. I also think, how- ever, that the system of that communication (calls + gestures) has not been described, and may not yet be describable from a semiologically satisfactory point of view. I am also not unaware of the different versions of Hockett's research (including that with Ascher), and contrary to what Kahn and Linden think, I do not endorse them. I simply point out that they have long since provided a good epistemological and theoretical base for the problems posed by animal communi- cation and that they have not been used systematically enough, or really discussed. The problems raised by Kahn remain marginal; even if pro- nouns are a linguistic universal (in the Chomskyan sense), which is not certain, they do not constitute an obligatory de- fining characteristic of language. The fact that Lacan has ex- pressed agreement with Benveniste's view of the subjectivity of pronouns proves nothing, given that the theoretician and the writer are much less rigorous than the clinician. The prob- lem is to know whether the mirror stage precedes the I stage, and whether it indicates objectively a grasp by the child of consciousness of his individuality-which is undisputed. The citation of Marx is well-known; it is from The German Ideology (cf. Mounin 1972:225-52, esp. 231). I appreciate Stokoe's response, also being acquainted with his very original and very necessary work on the double articulation of ASL. I am not persuaded, however, that ASL offers the duality of patterning of doubly articulated human natural language, for the same reasons that I have developed in connection with the sign language of the American Indians (see n. 9 above; also see Mounin [1970:135-48] on the puzzling problem of double articulation in writing and in mathematical symbols, another problem very closely related to the one Stokoe raises). Concerning the relative silence of Washoe and its explana- tion in terms of the perception she may have had of her inferior social status (Handelman), one must be prepared to accept all the data that may be furnished on this point, as well as on the self-rewarding character of communication on the level of the chimpanzees trained by man (Hewes). The essential objection to the theses proposed in the article lies in the problem of the definition of language (human?) and of communication (animal?). This problem may be artificial (Hewes), uninteresting (Steklis), unimportant (Stopa), or poorly posed (Umiker-Sebeok). In my opinion, primatologists, ethologists, and anthropologists are right to appreciate in the first place the wealth of data offered, the fine quality of recent descriptions, and the importance of the anthropological prob- lems raised. This does not deny, however, the subsequent necessity-and this is where the semiologist comes in-of classifying and ordering the discoveries under the name of social behavior, communication, language, in order to under- stand their precise anthropological significance. No physician would be satisfied to say that the differences in temperature and pressure that create the wind, the beating of the heart, the internal-combustion engine, and the turbo-reactor are all members of the large class of phenomena "creators of move- ment" and that it is useless to study the profound physical differences among these phenomena, doubtless more important than their common membership in mechanics. All the other objections are stimulating, but not convincing. Certainly one must be very exact in demonstrating that an animal is capable of abstraction and symbolization; but even in the framework of sophisticated training, the fact that Washoe associates the same gestural sign with all toothbrushes, or that Sarah associates the same plate with all apples, is the same kind of fact as man's association of the word "horse" with all the occurrences of HORSES in his experience. Certainly also, as Klein says, the handling of the symbol /verb "to be"/ with Sarah is of great interest for what Piaget would call the con- struction of pragmatic, or operative, logical relations. This does not, however, alter the fact that the verb "to be" is not a universal necessary for the definition of language. Klein's analysis thus does not annul the observation of Kitahara- Frisch on the dangers of Anglocentrism. Finally, while I think (with Feldesman and Kitahara-Frisch) that the current work leads rather to the idea of a continuous gradation of various successive forms of animal communication and human lan- guage than to the idea of a sharp break between the two, I state in my conclusion that one must feel free to accept the answer one finds to this question, whatever it is-but for good reasons. All of my work has tended to suggest that work like that of Hockett, Martinet, and Prieto on the specific character of nonlinguistic codes has been too little used in a domain to which it may have much to offer. May I repeat that, up to now, it seems to me that linguists and semiologists have made more effort to learn the language and assimilate the data of ethologists and anthropologists than the latter have made to assimilate the findings of linguistics and semiology? I hope that the discussions provoked by the above article will be for both the beginning of a better recipro- cal association.] References Cited ABBOTT, CLIFFORD F. 1975.
