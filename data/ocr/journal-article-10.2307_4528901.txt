<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BANQUET'S AFTERMATH: YAN JIDAO'S CI POETICS AND THE HIGH TRADITION* BY ROBERT ASHMORE University of California, Berkeley I. Introduction At what point in the history of medieval Chinese literary culture should one say that the history of the genre of "song lyric," or ci ", begins? Many of the musical tune-forms that make up the genre can be traced back to at least the mid-eighth century;1 by this measure, the eleventh-century lyricists from the heyday of the banquet ci writers such as Fan Zhongyan {Efrj (989-1052), Zhang Xian S (990-1078), Yan Shu 3 (991-1055), Ouyang Xiu tfM (1007- 1072), and YanJidao !AL (1 1030?-- 1110?) were heirs to nearly four centuries of tradition in the craft. Another way, however, to approach the question of the beginnings of ci is to attempt to locate the time at which the genre begins to be discussed within the tradition as an object of serious historical inquiry, and to be accorded a secure place among older literary forms. As is well known, when asked in this way the question yields a much later date, and a more prob- lematic set of issues. It was not until surprisingly late that the "his- * I would like to thank Peter Bol, Tim Chan, Christian DePee, Ron Egan, Paul Kroll, Stephen Owen, Michael Puett, Eric Wanxiang Wang, Stephen West, and an anonymous reviewer for this journal for their comments, criticisms, and en- couragement at various stages in the preparation of this article. 1 The tradition of the court music repertoires of the Sui and Tang referred to as yanyue r. is the earliest traceable direct source for many of the metrical patterns that came to make up the ci genre. In particular, many ci metrical pat- terns can be traced back to the repertoire lists occurring in the Jiaofangji gt)"d of Cui Lingqin J.t, a catalogue of the repertoires of imperial music and dance troupes during the reign of emperor Xuanzong ;T,s (712-56).

Indeed, the very strenuousness of the rhetoric of such late-imperial ci apologists as Zhang Huiyan E, , (1761-1802), who attempted to legitimize the genre by systemati- cally reinterpreting the tradition in terms of political allegory, be- speaks an enduring distrust of the form.3 The reasons for the persistent difficulty of representing a "history of ci' are varied, but the relation between the newer song lyric genre and the established lyric tradition of the literati shi | is central to the problem at every level. Ci, to echo the influential formulation of the twelfth-century lyricist and critic Li Qingzhao ,ifH (1084- 1155?), was always "something different" in relation to shi,4 but the precise nature of this difference was difficult to pin down in a way that did not in effect deny all claim for ci as "serious" writing. The outlines of what would become a relatively stable field of debate and theorization about the aesthetic distinctiveness and historical filiation of ci, or "cixue" Jr- as it came to be called, began to emerge only during the latter part of the eleventh century, largely out of disputes over the merits of the ci of Su Shi t (1037-1 101).5 The 2 Two of the main obstacles to serious consideration of ci as part of literary history were (1) the disreputable ethical associations of ci as part of an ethos of banqueting and carousing with singsong girls, and (2) the difficulty of establishing a positive lineage of historical antecedents for ci composition. These issues are discussed, respectively, in two articles in the volume Voices of the Song Lyric in China, edited by Pauline Yu (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994): Ronald C. Egan's "The Problem of the Repute of Tz'u During the North- ern Sung" (191-225), and Pauline Yu's "Song Lyrics and the Canon: A Look at Anthologies of Tz'u" (70-103). 3 For further information on Zhang Huiyan and the "Changzhou school" of ci criticism associated with him, see Xie Taofang *4JLtJI, Zhongguo cixue shi tI]Jn Vt (Chengdu: Bashu shushe, 1993), 213-36, and Chia-ying Yeh Chao, "The Ch'ang-chou School of Tz'u Criticism," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 35 (1975), 101-132. 4 Her formulation is that ci "is a distinct family" 5 ^JI-- in relation to shi.

As with the dancing of Commissioner Lei of the Music Of- fice,6 even though they exhaust all the craft in the world, on the whole it is not in the basic character [of the respective forms].7 The phrase yi shi wei ci, with its suggestion that the ci of Su Shi, and those of other "non-expert" practitioners of the form as well, neglected the essential character of ci to such an extent that they might even be said not properly to be ci at all, encapsulates the po- sition of an important strand of later ci criticism, which one might characterize as "purist" or "antiquarian." The most explicit and most thoroughgoing early representative of this position was Li Qingzhao, whose survey of the history of the form up to her own day finds fault with virtually every major ci writer of the previous century for not having adhered strictly enough to the metrical re- quirements, proper diction, and thematic range appropriate for the form. Moreover, her assessment of the ci of Yan Shu, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi seems almost a direct paraphrase of Chen Shidao's criti- cism of Su Shi: i t ' ""I &lt;ti a T' if 'L {f/J4 w -S97S When it came to Yan Yuanxian [=Shu], Ouyang Yongshu [=Xiu], and Su Zizhan [=Shi], their scholarship reached the bounds of heaven and the hu- Fang Zhifan 7VWJ et al., Zhongguo cixue piping shi Ig4&amp;Jtt=17t (Beijing: Zhongguo shehui kexue chubanshe, 1994), 32-74, and Xie, 1-34. 6 Generally assumed to refer to the Lei Zhongqing --er44 mentioned in Cai Tao's flT iewei shan congtan _.,$A1 f as active in the Music Office during the Xuanhe era (1119-26); see Siku quanshu zongmu [ ] (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1987 [1965], hereafter SKZM), 2.1781. As the editors of the Siku quanshu point out, such an identification would cast doubt on Chen Shidao's authorship of the received text of the Houshan shihua &amp;tUg4,3 since Chen died in 1102. It would appear that the extant text of the Houshan shihua is an amalgam of com- ments from a shihua originally written by Chen Shidao and interpolations added later. This is the view presented by Guo Shaoyu #M in his Song shihua kao =n4w&amp; (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1979), 15-20. For our purposes it suffices to observe that the phrase 'zyi shi wei ci" as applied to the ci poetry of Su Shi becomes a central point of reference for debate about the merits of ci in the early twelfth century. 7The comment appears in the Houshan shihua.

Yet [what they wrote] was all nothing more than shi with uneven caesurae and line-breaks.8 The phrase "xueji tian ren" r~ - f. k echoes one of the earliest and most definitive defenses of "serious" or scholarly writing as a lasting cultural legacy, found in Sima Qian's "Letter to Ren An."9 By denying any expertise in ci composition to Yan Shu, Ouyang Xiu and Su Shi, yet granting at the same time their preeminence in shi and in the sort of scholarship that "reaches the bounds of heaven and the human," Li Qingzhao defends the distinctiveness of ci in a way that appears not to contest the essential unimportance of the form in comparison to more "serious" literary and scholarly pursuits. While the phraseyi shi wei ci was generally read as a criticism,10 the formulation was also echoed by admirers of Su's song lyrics and viewed as a positive agenda whereby the suspect genre of ci might be "redeemed" through treatment with the broader thematic range and more frankly autobiographical voice characteristic of literati shi. 1 The Jin-dynasty philologist and critic Wang Ruoxu ~EJ~ (1174- 1243) provides a useful survey of this strand in later ci criticism: ' f r _1- tva= r- 'Jfitff k T ''45: 3^M&amp; '*Affi- jtt14e X mSM ' A E- -WS i1T '.

Read in the context of similar critical statements in the Houshan shihua, and Jiangxi-school poetic theory in gen- eral, such comments would seem to bear on the relation between the norms of a given literary genre and the anomalous force of talent or personality of certain rare individuals to transcend those norms. The point would thus be not to deny the superlative achievements of writers like Su Shi, but rather to warn ordinary writers of the danger of taking them as models. " For a representative discussion of the relevant issues, see Fang Zhifan, op. cit., 38-56.</page><page sequence="5">THE BANQUET'S AFTERMATH 215 Chen Houshan [Shidao] said that "Zizhan wrote shi in place of ci" this is an extremely groundless opinion, yet the people of this age all believe it. Only MaoJingchan provided an argument to show that it is not so, saying that Su Shi's ci are number one from antiquity up to the present. Master Zhao, pres- ently of the Hanlin academy,12 says this as well, showing implicit agreement with him [i.e., Mao]. As I take it, the principle of shi and ci is just one and the same, and does not allow for looking on the two differently. Yet since the worst of the compositions of this latter age acquired the habits of over-re- fined seductiveness and weak brittleness, falling in with the tastes of the vul- gar, high-minded men and outstanding scholars have from time to time competed to outdo one another in this sort of thing. Things have continued on in this way, day by day tending toward a debauched torpor. And from this some have rushed to the conclusion that the form itself ought to be like that, not understanding that it is the gradual accumulation of abuses that has brought matters to this pass. Wen Boqi'3 said, "The master [i.e. Su Shi] worried that through misfortune he might become mired in that [i.e. the morally degenerate ethos of ci]; therefore he reached out and stopped it,14 establish- ing a new conception in his distinctive way, and incorporating the mode of versification of the shi poet (yuyi shirenjufa gIA'bJiJ)." This also is in- correct. Su Shi was a great master of manly literature (xiong wen k;z); com- posing "music bureau" songs'5 was a game for him-only consider, could it be that he would "compete to outdo others in vulgarity"? As I take it, it [his excellence in writing ci] was due to the fact that his heavenly endowment was beyond the ordinary, and the vitality of his phrases surging; it was for this reason that whenever he set brush to paper he left worldly dust behind- nothing more than that.'6 The position that Su Shi did in fact write ci in a way that incorpo- rated shi compositional techniques, and in so doing "redeemed" the genre, became a standard feature in many versions of the history of song lyric during the Northern Song. 17 While Wang Ruoxu cites this 12 Referring to thejin-dynasty official and scholar Zhao Bingwen kt (1159- 1232). 13 AJin-dynasty scholar who had written extensive commentaries to the works of Su Shi. 14 This "it" ; may be taken to refer either to a latent moral susceptibility in Su Shi's own personality, or to the presumedly innate tendency of the genre towards degeneracy. 15 As is often the case, the termyuefu here is used to designate the genre which present-day convention consistently refers to as ci. On early nomenclature of the genre, see below at nn. 24, 29. 16 Hunan shihua j=*149, in Ding Fubao TMR, ed., Lidai shihua xubian 1M{k=#"*X (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1986 [1983]), 517. 17 This basic view, in fact, informs much of the literary history of the period down to the present day. In the following passage drawn from an influential university textbook-it is remarkable to see the extent to which the basic lines of the traditional narrative as outlined and modified by Wang Ruoxu are preserved: "[Su Shi in his cd] further broke through the old rubric of exclusive focus on</page><page sequence="6">216 ROBERT ASHMORE view as belonging to another critic, and immediately goes on to take issue with it, his own position is in effect a more extreme version of a similar, basically negative, assessment of the status of ci as a dis- tinctive literary form: both critics view Su Shi's exemplary status as an author of ci as arising, paradoxically, from the very way in which he diluted, or erased outright, the distinctiveness of the genre vis-a- vis shi. Where Wen Boqi sees him as exemplary in having "corrected" certain ethically and aesthetically dangerous tendencies of the form by an infusion of "shi-like" compositional techniques, Wang Ruoxu sees his status as "number one from antiquity up to the present day" as stemming from the irrepressible creative power of a master of "masculine literature," which-correctly, in Wang's view-simply ignores the misguided notion of any basic distinction between the two genres. 18 Both these narratives that of the antiquarian purists who saw the history of the genre as a rearguard action against violations of the norms governing what is "proper" to ci, and that of the advocates of Su Shi's heroic "redemption" of a morally compromised genre through an infusion of elements of shi were to exert a strong influence over subsequent historiography and criticism of ci. When we turn to con- sider the production, performance, and textual transmission of ci as part of the cultural and intellectual history of the Northern Song, however, it is important to realize that both versions obscure at least as much as they reveal about that history. For by the time the battle lines had been drawn between the positions of the two critical camps outlined above, they were both essentially arguing about a genre conceived in terms of literagyform that is, in terms of textual require- ments concerning meter, style, diction, thematic range, and so on. Yet throughout its early history, up to the latter part of the eleventh century, the ci genre had been distinguished from shi not primarily romantic yearning and the sorrows of parting that had held sway from the Tang and Five Dynasties... He was able to use ci to express all those themes which had long been customarily used by shi writers, such as meditations on antiquity, remi- niscences of past experience, records of excursions, argumentative exposition, and so on; and this allowed ci to struggle free from the state in which it had existed merely as the lyrics to a musical tune, and to become a new poetic form capable of independent development" (emphasis mine). See You Guo'en J, et al., eds., Zhongguo wenlxue shi @J&lt;;et (Beijing: Renmin wenxue chubanshe, 1987), 3.66. 18 The combination, so evident in this passage, of gendered language for dis- cussing types of writing and the view of proper writing as being in part a matter of the author's moral and (explicitly or by implication) sexual hygiene is a dimen- sion of early ci criticism worthy of separate study.</page><page sequence="7">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 217 by formal or thematic criteria, but first and foremost in terms of criteria of performance and use: while the shi form could be chanted (yong 3* oryin ) by a single reader in private, ci were composed to be sung (chang RN1) in a banquet setting, typically by women singers.'9 For participants in the culture of early song lyric, the essential distinc- tiveness of what we now call ci was conceived in these terms of use and performative context rather than in terms of the formal features (metrical, thematic, stylistic, and so on) which were to become the distinguishing characteristics of the two forms from the twelfth cen- tury on. A survey of the titles of early song lyric anthologies can serve as a reminder of this earlier "functional" notion of the genre, as these titles typically allude either directly or metonymically to the ban- quet context where the lyrics collected in those anthologies were destined to be performed: "Anthology for Among the Flowers," Huajian ji ,JHI "Anthology for Before the Cup," Zunqian ji #FJFJ , or simply, "Anthology for Family Banquets," Jia2anji 0f2O To render these titles as "Songbook for Use among the Flowers," "Songbook for Use before the Cup," and so on, would perhaps be to belabor the point but this is essentially their implication. A further indication that a functional, rather than a formal, dis- tinction was primary in the early period of the form may be found in the fact that certain "ci' included in the Huajianji are elsewhere collected as "shki.'"2' After all, particularly in the case of the short xiao ling dL \ meters that predominate in early ci writing, the formal, textual distinctions between ci and regulated shi poetry especially the regu- lated quatrain were often extremely small. The "adaptation" (yinkuo X4t) of existing shi to banquet song meters, a particularly promi- nent technical dimension of early ci composition, often involved only the slightest tweaking omitting a syllable here, repeating a line- 19 This general distinction in regard to the "normal" mode of reading/perfor- mance for the two lyric genres holds in the case of the Northern Song; during the Tang dynasty there was a rich tradition of singing shi poems which for a time coexisted and overlapped with the song forms later seen as predecessors to the ci tradition. The definitive study of Tang dynasty "sung shi poetry," or sheng shi W=*, is Ren Bantang Ef, Tang sheng shi WN34, (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1982). Tang sheng shi performance modes also appear to have survived alongside ci during the Northern Song, but they seem to have been viewed more as a literary curiosity than a widespread performance practice. See below at n. 22. 20 For sources and editions of these anthologies, see Rao Zongyi M, Ciji kao M,W (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1992). 21 For a discussion of this bibliographical issue, see Pauline Yu, op. cit., 76, and the colophon to Huajian ji in SKZM, 1823.</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT ASHMORE pattern there, interposing short filler phrases between lines, and so on. Far more than such superficial formal alteration, what made the resulting lyric belong to the genre of ci was the fact of its intended use, namely, that the "adapted" text was then destined to be sung to one of the repertoire of tunes of banquet lyric.22 As we have seen in the preceding discussion, both the "purist" and "redemptionist" models of the history of song lyric were fundamen- tally normative and prescriptive, providing accounts of the history of ci that were inseparable from their respective quite narrowly drawn views of what the song lyric form ought to be or become.23 If we attempt to address song lyric in its early phase as a form of literati cultural practice, however-that is, in the period before such prescriptive nar- ratives came to define the possibilities for discussing the form-and in a descriptive rather than a prescriptive way, a quite different pic- ture emerges. The advocates of the "redemption" of the form can- not speak of ci as simply words to banquet songs without ominous rumblings about the pernicious effects of such writing, left to its inherent ten- dencies, on the morals of the individual writer and on the broader literary culture; yet the fact remains that until the predominance of a formal definition of the identity of ci was established, this is ex- 22 We will return to some of these issues later in this essay as they bear on Yan Jidao's banquet lyrics. One might also note in this connection the case of Su Shi's three regulated quatrains entitled "Presented to Zhang Jiyuan" B§5 /J-~, "In reply to Li Gongze" ~%:' , and "The Moon at the Mid-autumn Festival" "'Jtk), which appear in his collected shi under the group title "Three Lyrics (cz) for the 'Yang Pass' Song" (see Kong Fanli [fLIV, ed., Su Shi shii ji ,.f:i. [Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1982], 3.751-3). Formally, as noted, they are not ci, but shi in the regulated quatrain form; moreover, it is unlikely that Su Shi or his contemporaries would have confused these lyrics with banquet ci in the functional sense alluded to here, since they were sung not by banquet singers to a tune from the banquet lyric repertoire, but, evidently, by Su Shi himself to a traditional tune associated with Wang Wei's quatrain "Sending off Mr. Yuan, Second of his Gen- eration, on a Mission to Anxi" ~-n; :f_{~ , which during the Tang had been put to music as the "Song of Yang Pass" RIEIh or "Song of Wei Town" Jt~fJH (see Quan Tang shi ±f#fA [hereafter QTS] [Beijing: Zhonghua shuju 1979 (1960)], 4.128.1306-7). Nonetheless, they are an interesting example of the interplay be- tween formal and functional criteria in establishing genre identity. Some later compilers of Su Shi's ci poetry in fact included these three poems in his collected ci. See the discussion in the colophon to Su Shi's ci collection in SKZM, 1808. 23 A similar observation could be made of much modern historiography of the form, with its reliance on teleological narratives of the development of individual genres, as seen so vividly in the passage cited in note 17 above, where the infant ci genre is depicted as "struggling free" of its connection with musical performance so as to become capable of "independent development" as a literary form. 218</page><page sequence="9">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 219 actly what ci were, and as such they were dabbled in to a greater or lesser degree by some of the most respected literati of the tenth and eleventh centuries. "Purist" critics of the ci tradition, such as Li Qingzhao, insisted that the lyrics written to banquet song tunes by writers like Ouyang Xiu, Yan Shu and Su Shi failed to meet the technical requirements for proper ci, and thus were in a sense not "really" ci-or were not, in a purist music expert's view, "really singable;" but as words to banquet songs it remains the case that these lyrics, "proper" ci or not, were really sung by banquet singers, and appre- ciated by audiences.24 When we look at the period before the distinctiveness of the ci genre came to be primarily thought of in terms of form, in other words, when the genre still was simply "the sort of thing one writes to be sung at banquets" the period we will call here, perhaps stretching a term, the genre's "prehistory" a number of intriguing cultural, literary, and ethical questions present themselves. The literati au- thors of early ci were in the interesting position of being engaged simultaneously in two fundamentally distinct modes of textual pro- duction modes, moreover, which were associated with quite dis- tinctive constellations of ideological claims (or disclaimers). On the one hand, as authors of shi and more generally of wenzhang-they generated texts in a formal and public mode which were meant to become a permanent record of their ethical and political engage- ment in their world. On the other hand, as authors of song lyric, they produced texts which were intended simply as scripts to perfor- mances, ephemeral products of moments of idleness. How exactly does such a practice of ci writing relate to the legacy of the "high" 24 For purposes of clarity, I use ci here as the unique Chinese designation of the song lyric genre; however, the early nomenclature for the form is notoriously fluid "name 4 (or 5, or 6) traditional names for ce" has long been a favorite test question for undergraduate courses in Chinese literary history. Such fluidity, in- deed, may itself testify to the fact that the genre was first thought of not so much as a clearly-defined literary form as a loosely-conceived kind of functional cat- egory, "the kind of lyric text one uses for banquet songs." Designations for the form include, along with "lyrics" (ci), "little lyrics" (xiao ci /J\41J), "lyrics to 'Music Bureau' [tunes]" (yuefu ci .X"fiJ), "'Music Bureau' [songs]" (yuefu), "Lyrics for Musical Pieces" (quzi ci T+ J)' "Remainders (or "Superfluity") of shi" OP, among others. I have not surveyed enough sources to make a conclusive claim, but my sense that the prominence of the designation "long and short lines" (chang duan ju KU'qJ) occurs primarily in twelfth-century and later writings would accord with the thesis that this was the period which saw a shift towards a textual-formal conception of the genre's identity.</page><page sequence="10">ROBERT ASHMORE canon of shi, and more generally to the scholarly and literary tradi- tion through which these writers traced their links to antiquity? Is it the serious, public mode of writing associated with wenzhang which reveals the writer's true character and concerns more authentically, or is it the playful, intimate mode of writing associated with banquet lyric? Few writers formulate more idiosyncratic and intriguing an- swers to these questions than YanJidao, a highly distinctive, yet often relatively neglected, writer who, albeit in an utterly personal way, reveals a great deal about the intellectual and moral temper of his age-a writer who, remarkably, uses the form of the banquet lyric in a way that is not only highly expressive but also "theoretical," as a vehicle for exploring some of these very questions concerning the functional distinctiveness of ci vis-a-vis shi: "high" versus "low," history versus ephemerality, frivolity versus seriousness, writing versus per- formance, and public versus private. II. An Idiosyncratic "History" YanJidao's preface to his own collected song lyrics is remarkable in a number of ways.25 It is one of a very few surviving contempo- rary prefaces to song lyric collections by Northern Song authors, and is yet more remarkable for having been written by the lyrics author himself.26 Perhaps most remarkable of all, however, is the overrid- ing tone of high seriousness and deep ethical engagement with which Yan describes the origins of his collection of ci. For even apologists for writers of ci in this period were often at pains to emphasize that the activity was nothing more than a light-hearted dabbling, engaged in during the intervals of leisure from the writer's proper sphere of action-public service and the writing of wenzhang. The opening phrase of Guan Zhu's WRAI ( 1135 jinshz) colophon to the ci collection of Ye Mengde * f,= (1077-1148) is typical in this respect: ^^H&amp; ' A1,gJ gA ° I " I= ,'l fiT o The Right Aide Master Ye was an exemplary Confucian scholar by virtue of his abilities in governance and in literary writing (wenzhang); in his leisure 25 It is not clear whether this piece originally appeared before or after the main body of Yan Jidao's lyrics. The term "preface" will be used here to render the original xu J,, without implying any claim as to its original or intended position. 26 Zhang Huimin ,:fQ, Song dai cixue ziliao huibian {tA,{J, 44- (Shantou: Shantou daxue chubanshe, 1993) is a convenient reference source for Song critical materials on ci. 220</page><page sequence="11">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 221 moments of brush and ink, he would make lyrics to] song-tunes, and these as well were the most wondrous in the world.27 As we see, there is no positive claim here for the importance of writing such songs. Rather, Guan Zhu defuses the sort of opprobrium that might be incurred by a writer who wrote such things in full earnest by emphasizing the writer's eminence in what are acknowledged as the only truly serious realms of accomplishment for a gentleman, and reminding us that the songs, albeit "wondrous," are, when viewed within the overall ethos of their author, properly viewed as mere trifles, thrown off in moments of idleness. The overall strategy Guan Zhu employs in explaining the relation between the private, informal world of ci writing and the serious world of the writer's primary ethical engagements and writing of wenzhang may be characterized as contextualizing and metonymic: to gain a proper understanding of what these banquet songs mean as expressions of their author, Guan Zhu tells us, one must place them within the broader context of their author's accomplishments; an apt appreciation of the "wondrous- ness" they may possess must keep in view that they are peripheral both to the serious concerns of their author and to more serious modes of writing. Such a contextualizing or metonymic approach is quite characteristic of the prefaces to early single-author ci collections. Within the context of such rhetorical norms, it is clear that merely by bothering to compose a formal preface to his own song lyrics, Yan Jidao risks the appearance of excessive seriousness and deliberation over what was, by common consent, a light genre.28 The tone of the preface, moreover, while striking notes of a wistful playfulness, on the whole describes YanJidao's relation to his song lyrics as one of utter absorption. As we shall see, this most unusual piece of ci criti- cism also expresses, in YanJidao's personal idiom, a view of the relation between banquet lyric and the high tradition of the shi that is pro- foundly idiosyncratic, yet at the same time very revealing of its cul- tural moment. Where more conventional ci prefaces of the time show 27 Zhang, 210. 28 This appearance is all the more striking in view of the fact that Yan Jidao did not, as far as we know, take similar pains over his writings in the more "serious" forms. We cannot know with certainty what texts might have been lost, yet it is remarkable that while Yan Jidao does appear to have had considerable fame (perhaps mingled with notoriety) as a writer with a distinctive character and literary opinions, there is no record of him or anyone else having attempted to compile a collection of his wenzhang. We will return to these issues in the final section of this essay.</page><page sequence="12">222 ROBERT ASHMORE a preference for metonymy, YanJidao expresses the relation between his banquet songs and the "high" canon via a series of bold and paradoxical metaphors. At the outset, YanJidao claims a relation between his song lyrics and the values of the classical poetic canon through the name he suggests for his collected lyrics: bu wang M t, or "filling in what has been lost." The preface begins by glossing the meaning of this title: (M S) -I M' t1 - "Filling in What Has Been Lost," in one sheaf: filling in what has been lost in 'Music Bureau' lyrics.29 While in appearance deceptively simple, YanJidao's proposal of this title for his lyrics, and his single-phrase gloss of its meaning, re- late directly to his highly idiosyncratic approach to a set of ques- tions about the high canon and low entertainment, seriousness and play. The term bu wang itself immediately raises the question of the relation between the banquet songs and the high canon, for it de- rives from the technical terminology of criticism and commentary on the very first lyric anthology in the tradition, the canonical Book of Odes. There was a long-standing convention in critical writing on ci whereby parallels would be drawn between ci and the Zheng and 29 I cite here the collated text of Yang Jixiu , Xiaoshan ci yanjiu 'iiThJft (Taibei: Liming wenhua shiye, 1980), which, its title notwithstanding, is essentially an annotated critical edition of Yan Jidao. This preface appears on page 25 of that work. The phraseyuefu, or "Music Bureau," here as quite often, particularly in Northern Song sources, serves as a synonym for the song lyric genre we now usually refer to as ci. The termyuefu, of course, is redolent of associations with traditional musical, poetic, and political theory, and is certainly susceptible of being used to invoke such associations, as we see, for example, in its use in the title of the ruefu buti OMjf, a collection of ci written by Song loyalists in the aftermath of the fall of the Southern Song, where we would be justified in constru- ing the title literally as "[Songs composed on] topics left out by the Music Bu- reau" the title here serving, along with hints in the collection itself, to imply that the poems are to be read in the mode of political allegory (for a discussion of this anthology, see Xia Chengtao's I "ruefu bu ti kao" ;Mge, , in idem, Tang Song ciren nianpu * 4j i [Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1979], 376-82). One might also imagine that the termyuefu serves as a link drawn by ci apologists to the tradition of "ballad" (yuefu) shi poetry. The point to bear in mind, however, is that while such associations are available to be drawn via the termyuefu, that term also functions quite normally in Northern Song writing as one of the many simple designations of what we now uniformly call ci (see n. 24 above). Where a writer does not otherwise indicate that some such association is in- tended-and this, as far as I can tell, Yan Jidao does not do-we are not justified in assuming one.</page><page sequence="13">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH Wei "Airs" within the Odes. Such a convention is rhetorically suited to a mode of argument similar to the "metonymic" one we observed in the Guan Zhu preface cited above: "Just as, within the totality of kinds of writing represented within the Odes canon, Confucius found a place for the relatively 'low' 'Airs' of Zheng and Wei; so we ought now, within the totality of genres we allow, to find a place for this relatively 'low' sort of song." As we will see, YanJidao's argument takes an entirely different track. To trace some of the unexpected connections he draws between these apparently disparate traditions warrants an excursion into some of the principal relevant sources. The formulaic pattern followed in the Mao commentary immedi- ately before the text of a given poem is "A, B -t1," where A is the poem's title, and B a short statement of the normative ethical intent expressed in the poem, as we see-to select an example at random- in the Mao commentary following poem 14: 4i' , ±3t RJ: Q Rtg o° "Grasshopper:" the wife of a grandee is able to use ritual propriety to guard herself.30 Within the Xiaoya /]J\ section of the anthology, however, six titles appear without corresponding texts. The Mao commentary lists each of them and assigns to each a statement of its fundamental ethical intent, according to the formula presented above. Only after listing in this way the first three titles and their traditional meanings does the commentary note that the texts to these poems are lost. The relevant section of the Mao commentary reads as follows: m 1t ° o m t + 2wAt A n^, i 1-1 -, 0 "South Hill:" filial sons exhort one another concerning the maintenance of parents. "White Flower:" the purity and whiteness of the filial son. "Flower- ing Millet:" the seasons are in harmony- and the harvest is rich, favorable for millet. Their significance is known, but the words are lost.31 Scholarly opinion was divided as to whether these so-called "lost odes" were actually lost poems, or whether the six titles might origi- nally have referred to instrumental pieces without words.32 Yet for 30 Mao Shi zheng yi :I¥E1, in Ruan Yuan P[T;, ed., Shisan jing zhu shu +-{_ itS (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1980), 286.

Emphasis mine. 32 The latter in fact seems to have become the majority view. See, for example, 223</page><page sequence="14">224 ROBERT ASHMORE many later writers, the idea of a lacuna in this, the most revered book of poetry in the tradition, proved tantalizingly suggestive. One such writer was the Jin-dynasty scholar Shu Xi I r (?-after 300), who actually composed six poems, collectively entitled simply "Bu wang," "Filling in What has Been Lost," in an archaizing Odes-like style to take the place of the ostensibly "lost" odes, working from the "significances" assigned to the titles by the Mao commentary, and producing poems to express them retroactively, as it were. And while Shu Xi's poems do not figure prominently in most premodern or modern accounts of literary history, his project seems to have gained a certain emblematic status, for these six "Bu wang" poems were given pride of place at the head of all the subgenres of shi poetry included in Xiao Tong's (501-531) Wen Xuan 3Z X, suggesting perhaps that the idea of restoring an original completeness to the Odes canon could serve as a powerful symbol for the craft of shi poetry as a whole. This seems quite natural when one recalls that the same word, shi =, which refers to the genre of "serious" literati poetry when used as a general noun, refers as a proper noun simply to the canonical Odes.33 The opening phrases of Yan Jidao's preface, then, claim that his new works were meant to fulfill a function within the tradition of song lyric analogous to such "filling in" of the "lost odes" within the tradi- tion of the canonical Odes. In this sense YanJidao is claiming a basic similarity between the two traditions, while simultaneously insisting on difference. It remains to be seen, however, exactly how he con- ceives of a "tradition" for song lyric, since we have already seen that one of the problems in situating song lyric historically during this period was the lack of any accepted lineage of historical models that could serve, as the Odes do for literati shi, to define such a tradition. In thinking through the terms of the analogy YanJidao draws to the "high" tradition, it may be useful to give closer attention to the case of Shu Xi and his "Bu wang" poems after all, this bit of liter- ary-historical lore, which would have been intimately familiar to Tang Pi Xirui fV0, Jingxue tong lun Ug.gWA (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1989 [1954]), Odes section, 53-54. 3 For Shu Xi's poems in their setting in the Wenxuan, see Xiao Tong, ed.

For whereas the latter, in their rapt focus on the pleasures and chagrins of the banquet, seem far removed from the profound historical and cultural concerns of classical hermeneu- tics and ethical thought, the former are avowedly engaged with the maintenance of the Traditionalist canon, and with the application of that canon to the inculcation of moral virtue. Interestingly, how- ever, Shu Xi's immediate motive in composing his "Bu wang" poems was in fact not unrelated to banqueting, as he explains in his pref- ace: {ff ° 'ffi,$HgtA ,a't ' - -1;MIAi° My colleagues at the Directorate of Studies35 and I practiced and performed 34 That the link between the notion of bu wang and the phraseology of the Mao commentary to the first set of "lost ode" titles quoted above, to the effect that "their significance is known, but the words are missing," was a quite conventional association for medieval literati is suggested, for example, by a poem by MengJiao in^[ (751-814) on seeing a fragmentary inscription on the wall of a pavilion-the title of an occasional shi, without the text of the poem itself-in the hand of Li Guan (~760-~788), a promising writer who had died at the age of 29. MengJiao's note to the title of his own poem applies the Mao commentary phrase 1XIit-=C i to the fragmentary Li Guan title; the second couplet of Meng's poem reads, X[Iff 9:, Tg&lt;nr o How can one know some wayfarer in the dark silence may not compose a "piece to fill in what's missing" (QTS 12.381.4271) Indeed, the prominent position of Shu Xi's "Bu wang" poems within the Wen xuan ought itself to be enough, given the central role of that anthology in literary education throughout the Tang and Song, to assure us that the tradition would have been intimately familiar to any medieval scholar with sound training. If one needed any further evidence that Yan Jidao's own upbringing would have in- cluded a particularly intimate awareness of the Wen xuan, one might mention that one of the most ambitious literary projects of Yan's father, Yan Shu, was the compilation of a continuation to the Wen xuan, entitled Ji xuan %. For discussion and sources, see Xia Chengtao's "Er Yan nianpu" - -t (in Tang Song ciren nianpu, 197-270), 247 and 268. To suggest that careful consideration of Shu Xi may help us in thinking through Yan Jidao's preface is not to imply that Yan closely fol- lowed or imitated Shu Xi. But he would certainly have had-and assumed in his readers-complete familiarity with Shu Xi's example. This assumed knowledge will provide an important point of reference in piecing together just what Yan Jidao meant to say about his own lyrics. 35 1J]Wg. This is the reading of the Li Shan commentary.

However, among the songs to be sung in that rite are some for which "one has the significances, but not the words." The music which serves to provide the measure for the rite was thus lacking and incomplete. Thereupon I imagined from afar those things that have passed away; focusing my thoughts on the past, I composed the texts to fill in, as a supplement to that ancient institution.36 By this account, then, the filling in of the supposed textual lacuna in the Book of Odes was a means to a more fundamental end, namely, the restoration to completeness of a ritual repertoire. The "town banquet," or xiangyinjiu WMffi, a sort of graduation banquet held by teachers and students, was essentially a drinking party.37 What set it apart from an ordinary drinking party was the body of ritually specified procedures to be followed during its performance, these specifications including, as we have seen, the types of song to be sung. To adapt J.L. Austin's terminology, the singing of particular songs at particular moments during the banquet was considered an essen- tial part of a "felicitous" performance of the rite.38 And we can see that the "significance" of a song in this ritual context includes, but is not reducible to, textual meaning, for just as important is the role played by the song in "providing the measure for the rite," in lend- ing coherence and temporal structure to the communal experience. Moreover, the performance of these particular songs, along with the totality of the procedures prescribed for the ritual, serve to substan- tiate a claim of temporal continuity perhaps in the logic of ritual it would be more exact to say, offunctional identit-with past perfor- mances of the ritual, ultimately leading back to the moment when it was first instituted. Shu Xi's impulse to write his "Bu wang" poems arises, then, not from the desire to replace lost texts so much as from the need to be able to say, on the occasion of a particular banquet, this reading as a variant, while giving as his primary reading [dJ~, or "of the same profession." 36 Xiao, 272; Lu, 639. 3 The main canonical sources for this ritual are Lifji section 45, and ri li {-, section 4 (See Ruan Yuan, 1682-1685 and 980-993, respectively). A detailed reconstruction of the procedures prescribed for this ritual in the Yi /i can be found in the Xiang yin jiu 1i yine jian shi Y M8 03i by Wu Hongyi WR in the series ri lifuyuanyanjiu congkan f{X # Af (Taipei: Chung Hwa Book Company, 1985). It is perhaps worth noting here that, while the so- called "lost odes" are indeed designated for performance during this ritual, Shu Xi's "Bu wang" texts do not seem to have caught on in subsequent ritual practice, these odes being performed as "panpipe-Odes" Vd="J, without words. 38 How to Do Things with Words (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1962, 1975).</page><page sequence="17">THE BANQUET'S AFTERMATH 227 that "this is not simply a banquet, but rather, a functionally com- plete performance of the xiangyinjiu."39 Shu Xi's composition of these poems hinges on the idea of a unique "fit" between a song and its sympotic occasion, and the idea, moreover, that a song, by being thus suited to its occasion, can serve to validate that occasion's spe- cial quality. It is this notion of the banquet song as an integral part of a communally significant act, and of bu wang as a measure taken to restore that act to its performative completeness after that com- pleteness has been lost, that will allow us to follow YanJidao's more idiosyncratic development of the idea of bu wang for his own ban- quet lyrics.

So I tried continuing the leftover threads of those worthies of the South,40 composing lines in five- and seven-syllable meters; what I hoped to get from this was simply my own amusement. In them I not only gave an account of the things I held dear, but also depicted those momentary sounds and sights over a cup of wine, and the things on the minds of those spending time with me. It has occurred to me that the feelings stirred by affairs of the world have never changed, from antiquity up to the present. My personal opinion is that the meaning in the poem must not have escaped people in the old days; it is simply that there is no means of transmitting it to us today. 3 While Shu Xi is quite straightforward about his own authorship of the texts of his "Bu wang" poems, the issues raised here form an interesting sidelight to the broader topic of the various motivatiotns and rationales for what is sometimes, perhaps uncharitably, thought of as "forgery" during the Jin dynasty. See in par- ticular Wang Yao's 3Ef analysis of the problem in the chapter on "Imitation and Forgery" in his Zhonggu wenxue lunji y (Beijing: Beijing daxue chuban- she, 1986), 196-21 1. Shu Xi was esteemed as an expert in antiquities and had participated as Editorial Director (zhuzuo lang *f'{A[) in the reconstitution of ancient texts from the cache of bamboo slips recovered from a tomb in 281 (the ostensible origin of the text now known as the Zhu shu ji nian IffIiEd). See his biography in Yin shu (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1987), 5.1432-3. 40 Judging from the stylistic models most commonly attributed to both Yan Jidao and his father Yan Shu, this would appear to be a reference to lyricists of the Southern Tang court, in particular to Feng Yansi BE (903-960). The phrase nan bu ft, however, can equally refer to the Tang dynasty proper, as we see for example in the title of the Nan bu xin shu 5 a miscellany of histori- cal and cultural data on the Tang compiled by Qian Yi RJ around the turn of the millenium. See SKZM 1189 for a bibliographical note on this work.</page><page sequence="18">228 ROBERT ASHMORE Therefore, I collectively designate these things I have composed as "filling in what has been lost."'41 The rhetorical conventions of the "preface," or xu Jf, to collec- tions of poetry lead one to expect some permutation of a familiar set of basic moves conventional encomia on the power of poetry, ac- counts of the ethical and historical wellsprings of the poetic faculty, along with some more or less detailed statements of the historical lineage to which the present work affiliates itself. By all conventional standards, however, YanJidao fails to make any of these moves in his preface. Far from providing an account of the vital ethical or political significance and power of poetry, he circumscribes quite pointedly his notion of a "good poem" to the sympotic context. A good poem, by this account, is one that satisfies the reveler "bobbing and sinking in wine." This effect of satisfaction is one described as almost physiological-the language here of "dissolving" and "dis- persing" is quasi-medical. Perhaps even more unsettling is the ap- parent lack of any positive historical tradition of poetry to point to; for the old lyrics, Yan Jidao baldly states, simply fail when judged by this imperious test. YanJidao's startling formulation of the rela- tion of the present-day poet to the poets of the past gives with one hand and takes away with the other. While asserting the fundamen- tal identity of the experiential truths of human response to the world, YanJidao simultaneously denies that any set of canonical texts can hope to serve as an enduring touchstone of that identity. While the poetic impulse may endure unchanged through time, the poem as text is at best only a provisional bearer of meaning, as the truths of experience continually require new poems to restore them to full expression. If the defining function of the literary preface is to place the new literary work within history and in relation to a canonical lineage, YanJidao here seems to have undermined that logic from within. As we inquire further into the model of poetic creativity devel- oped in this preface, and the relation of the terms of this model to those of traditional poetics, one sentence in particular will bear closer attention: "I not only gave an account of the things I held dear, but also depicted those momentary sounds and sights shared over a cup of wine." To "tell one's own preoccupations" PJfi f could serve as a paraphrase for a familiar traditional definition of poetry's es- 41 Yang, ibid.</page><page sequence="19">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 229 sential function: shiyan zi &gt; "the poem expresses what is in- tently on the mind." This view of the nature of poetry developed in conjunction with a hermeneutic tradition that took as its first axiom that the zhi expressed in the poem was at least potentially fully re- coverable by later readers. In place of this view, YanJidao depicts a kind of lyric that, more than simply expressing the abiding concerns of the poet, is uniquely tailored to the ephemeral circumstances of the setting in which it is performed. According to YanJidao's care- fully circumscribed view of the function of banquet poetry, the "mean- ing" of a poem is something that is only realized in performance, through the spontaneous match between lyric utterance and performative context: the drinking-party, encompassing author, per- former, and audience in a single, playful, communal entity. Some such redefinition of the notion of "meaning" L is necessary in order to make sense of YanJidao's surmise that "the meaning in the poem must not have escaped people in the old days; it is merely that there is nothing to transmit it to us today." In radical opposi- tion to the dominant strand of medieval poetic hermeneutics, Yan Jidao here makes the disturbing claim that a poem may survive in a textually intact form and yet leave us with no way of discovering its "meaning." The latter-day poet faced with poetry of the past is thus faced with an unsettling hermeneutical dilemma, in which, slightly altering the phrase of the Mao commentary to the Book of Odes quoted above, "the words are known, but the meaning is missing" t9H; e 8t ~42 42 It will be noted that this rephrasing of the "hermeneutical dilemma" de- scribed by YanJidao in the language of the Mao commentary involves substituting the yi X earlier rendered as "significance" with the yi &amp; given here simply as "meaning." Yan Jidao's echoing of the language of canonical scholarship, while essential to his argument, is rather oblique, and there is no reason to assume that he would have felt compelled to adhere to the terminological niceties of contem- porary hermeneutics. Stephen Van Zoeren, however, has argued that the distinc- tion between these two terms was not only preserved through the eleventh century, but was indeed central to Odes hermeneutics during that period. In particular, Cheng Yi's (1033-1107) iconoclastic hermeneutic of the Odes involves as a central move the deployment of this opposition to distinguish between the mere textual "meaning of the words" (wenyi 3Z) and the full meaning of the given Ode as a fully contextualized "speech act" (t). See his Poety and Personality: Reading, Exegesis, and Hermeneutics in Traditional China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), 162-66 (especially 165 n. 41) and 196-203. Thus, YanJidao's use of the term E rather than , while not necessarily deliberately mirroring the contemporary discourse on the Odes, would nonetheless be "terminologically correct," and con- ceptually apt, within that discourse. The concluding section of this essay will</page><page sequence="20">230 ROBERT ASHMORE Yan Jidao's description of the relation between the poet and the poetic past and his redefinition of the poem's "meaning" can be understood only in relation to the terms of traditional poetic criti- cism and hermeneutics; yet his reformulation is radically subversive of traditional claims about the value of poetic texts.43 The consequences for poetry as reformulated by Yan Jidao are far-reaching and var- ied. On the one hand, by depicting the function of lyric as grounded in the particulars of its performative context, YanJidao succeeds in conveying an alluring sense of the experience of poetry as one of spontaneity and cheerful abandon, as we see in the section of his preface immediately following: , A +U1a=X E N-p+ 1 , * `4 M A -0- 3 f: ,NM NWr o At the beginning, Shen Lianshu, twelfth in his generation, and Chenjunlong, tenth in his generation, had in their households the singing-girls Lian, Hong, Pin, and Yun, who would sample unaccompanied songs to amuse guests. Each time I "got" a new stanza, I would give a copy of it to them, and the three of us would listen to the song as we drank just for fun.44 With this air of playfulness, however, YanJidao's revised notion of the poem's "meaning" carries with it a sense of the lyric as a kind of perishable goods, best when consumed fresh, and prone to spoil- age in transit. By his account, the real meaning of the lyric does not inhere in any essential way in the text's structure as words on paper; rather, it is realizable only within the shared context of performance. In this sense, Yan Jidao's version of "meaning" bears some resem- blance to traditional ideas about the role of lyric in ritual contexts. We saw in the case of Shu Xi's "Bu wang" poems that their full sig- nificance, by the author's own account, was realized only through their performance in the xiang yin jiu rite. But essential to the very idea of ritual is the promise that if all of the proper rules are abided by, and in the proper spirit, the resulting communal act will consti- tute a valid or "felicitous" recreation of the given rite. YanJidao, on the other hand, has left no doubt that he and the other participants return to the question of Yan Jidao's relation with contemporary Odes hermeneu- tics. 43 Another interesting way in which Yan Jidao seems to deemphasize textual form as opposed to functional "use" in performance can be seen in the fact that his only reference to the actual form of his lyrics, "making lines in five- and seven- syllable meters" f'tL+*i, does not formally distinguish his lyrics from shi po- etry. 4 Yang, ibid.</page><page sequence="21">THE BANQUET'S AFTERMATH 231 in the original performances of his lyrics were not self-consciously adhering to any fixed procedures. Quite to the contrary, his very insistence on the playful spontaneity of the performances seems rather to raise the question whether such performances, once completed, could ever be recreated at all. These doubts are confirmed as YanJidao's narrative of the gen- esis of his song lyrics continues: Afterwards Junlong became a bedridden invalid, Lianshu passed away, and those wild stanzas and drunken lines drifted about the world along with the singers and wine-stewards of the two households. From that time on, these songs were transmitted at greater and greater degrees of remove, and textual errors accumulated. Then on the day jisi of the seventh month,45 the songs were assembled and placed in order by the Duke of Gaoping.46 Thinking back now of those people with whom I socialized and drank in those days, one of them already has trees growing on his grave, while the other is sick and can- not be with me. When I match up the events of joy and sadness, parting and meeting, which are recorded in this text, they are like a hallucination, like a lightning-flash, like last night's dream or the dust of a former age and all I can do is to close the book in a funk, stirred by the ease with which time slips by, and sighing at the insubstantiality of our foredestined experiences.47 This preface began, we recall, with a confident announcement of the purpose that prompted the composition of these new song lyr- ics: to compensate for the loss of a special kind of "meaning" from old poetry. At this point, however, we are made aware of the para- doxical status of the preface itself in relating this original intent. For the preface serves to introduce the definitive textual form in which these songs will henceforth be disseminated; and yet the process of dissemination itself dates from the series of events that marked the collapse of the performative setting within which the songs had, for a time, achieved their special meaning the death of Shen Lianshu, the illness of Chen Junlong, and the dispersal of their households. The full sense in which these songs may once have "filled in what had been lost," we now learn, is irretrievably past, and in respect to the original meaning the songs may once have had we stand, it would 4 This date corresponds to August 9, 1089 in the western calendar. 46 The reference is to Fan Chunren p- Kfz (1027-1101), who inherited this title from his father, Fan Zhongyan. 47 Yang, ibid.</page><page sequence="22">232 ROBERT ASHMORE seem, rather in the position of archaeologists attempting to decipher fragmentary records in an unknown language. The only remaining sense in which the present collection might be said to "fill in what has been lost" is merely a textual one; yet this preface, in suggesting the ways in which the songs it introduces were originally meant to "fill in what is missing," took as its point of departure a sense of the fickleness of mere text as a vehicle for communicating the sort of intimate meanings shared by friends banqueting together. YanJidao tells us that some of the songs had become garbled in transmission, and the present collection is to serve, apparently, as an "authorita- tive edition." Yet the authority to which these particular texts might lay claim seems very much in question, since their author himself seems to have something of the confused archaeologist about him as he surveys them after the fact. It is thus in a sense fitting that, ac- cording to the preface, the actual editorial work was carried out by someone else. As we saw at the outset of this discussion, Yan's preface is unusual in that it directly addresses the special performative context that made banquet songs a distinctive lyric genre, and in the way it borrows from the language of canonical poetic discourse to argue that this kind of poetry has a special sort of value. However, though the rhetoric of this preface is derived from that of traditional writing on literary history, it is now clear that its relation to that public discourse re- mains irreducibly metaphorical. Rather than claim that his lyrics intervene or take up a position in literary history as a common cul- tural legacy, YanJidao presents us with a story of their genesis and transmission as a sort of literary history writ small, from their ori- gins in a golden age of immediacy and fullness of meaning, through a cataclysmic rupture, and leading up to a present in which the full significance of the surviving textual legacy has become a matter for bookish conjecture. This is a kind of literary history, but one that insists on a purely private relevance. As an answer, then, to the question about the relation of the "performance texts" of banquet song and the high lyric tradition of the shi, YanJidao's "solution" solves noth- ing; his preface to the definitive texts of his songs is one which, quite paradoxically, ends by suggesting that there is no longer any real reason to bother preserving them. As we turn to examine some of the songs themselves, however, we see that this idiosyncratic preface does not really serve to provide historical context or theoretical grounding for the songs, but offers instead a sort of master narrative about language, performance, and</page><page sequence="23">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 233 loss to which the songs in this sense every bit as "theoretical" as the preface which purports to introduce them persistently return.

Thinking back on things of the past is prone to set one weeping. White-haired WangJian remains; one still sees a chanter of verses. Studying the Way in deep mountains, all you'll get is old; thousand-year fame has no bearing on the self. Drinking-parties, song-gatherings: don't spurn their frequency. How can those things compare with-in the South lane- grabbing one year's spring?48 At first blush, it might seem unlikely that the first stanza of this lyric could tell us much about YanJidao as a poet, since, apart from the interposition of the rather banal third line, that stanza consists of a very close adaptation, oryinkuo ;f, of a regulated quatrain by the Tang poet ZhangJi N # (-767--830): HRr 1L=n7*n#A Since Master Yu left, my companions are few; since Dongye passed away, my scroll-case is the poorer.

In fact the textual near-identity of that stanza and Zhang Ji's poem may allow us to ask questions about the ways in which early banquet lyric is "shadowed" by literati shi, and in par- ticular about the emblematic role played within YanJidao's poetics by the relation between banquet lyric and past poetry. Before turn- ing to these questions, however, we need first to consider briefly what the precursor quatrain means, and how it expresses it, when read as a poem by ZhangJi. "Master Yu" is a reference to the poet Yu Hu 2Ft (fl. late eighth c.), about whom we know relatively little, apart from scattered ref- erences and his seventy-some-odd surviving poems. "Dongye," of course, is the cognomen of the famed mid-Tang poet MengJiao c (750-814). This poem is likely to date from the period between 821 and around 829, when both ZhangJi and WangJian occupied offi- cial posts in the Tang capital Chang'an. These two poets, of roughly the same age, would have been in their mid-fifties at the beginning of this period. The phrase "white-head WangJian" refers not only to that poet's advancing age, however, but also to one of Wang's own poems, in which he comments on the late start he got in his official career with the line, "my hair already white, I now for the first time serve as an official" jt.5' Thus the epithet "white- head" is not simply descriptive, but functions at the same time as an affectionate nickname, alluding to WangJian's shared status as a poet, and, more generally, to the tribulations and setbacks both men had encountered (ZhangJi himself having made a notably late start in his own official career). The act of naming, in fact, is central to the rhetoric of this short poem, in which two names serve to designate different types of ab- sence, while a third provides consolation by celebrating a continu- ing presence. Yu Hu's name stands for an absent companion; but the absences evoked by MengJiao's name are more complex. Meng Jiao, for one thing, is dead rather than merely absent. The way in which his absence is noted is curious, and allows us perhaps to an- ticipate why this quatrain might have elicited a sympathetic response from YanJidao over a century and a half later. On the face of it, it seems odd that ZhangJi should say that his "scroll-case is the poorer" because of MengJiao's death, since that event would hardly have 50 Wang Jian, "To Show to My Colleagues on First Arriving at Zhaoying" 81JyIJExi, QTS 9.299.3393.</page><page sequence="25">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 235 had any effect on texts safely stored away in ZhangJi's possession. Apparently ZhangJi is implying that what he values in poetry is not the texts as artifacts but rather the activit_ of composing and exchanging them as part of an ongoing friendship. This is confirmed in the con- cluding couplet of the poem, in which the absences lamented in the first couplet are counterbalanced by the name of "white-head Wang Jian," which gives consolation precisely because, unlike the other two names, it is still linked to a vivid presence before the poet's eyes, performing new poetry in an ongoing exchange. How, then, do these lines "mean differently" when a poem grounded in the friendship between ZhangJi and Wang Jian is adapted and set within a banquet song by Yan Jidao? Since the meaning of the original poem hinges on the consolatory act of naming "white-head WangJian" and summoning up the vivid image of Wang "chanting verses," we might begin by focusing on how the meaning of this act is transformed in its new context. The most literal reading would be simply to take the referent of the name as unchanged. But in the context of YanJidao's banquet song, reference to the historical Wang Jian would undermine the rhetoric of consolation of ZhangJi's poem, since for an eleventh-century audience it will have been quite evi- dent that any consolation ZhangJi might have derived from Wang Jian's enduring presence was only temporary, both men having long since succeeded to the status of dead writers of a former dynasty. A more natural way of construing the phrase within the context of a banquet performance, of course, would be to understand "white-head WangJian" as referring to a literary friend of the poet present at the banquet, or perhaps to Yan Jidao himself. Simply to attempt to identify the new referent of the phrase "white- head WangJian" in the context of YanJidao's song is "reading" of a very minimal sort; nonetheless, observations at even this simplistic level may serve to illustrate important questions of genre in literati ci during the "prehistory" of the form, and dimensions of language and poetics that pertain more specifically to Yan Jidao. First, this stanza is a vivid reminder that the primary distinction between what came later to be designated as the mutually exclusive genres of shi and ci remains through most of the eleventh century a functional and contextual one, rather than a formal, textual one. It becomes a concern of lyric within the tradition of literati banquet song in ways and to a degree that were never true of the tradition of literati shi- that what is textually the same can become performatively different. Thus, while we cannot "literally" say that the same text is, as a text</page><page sequence="26">236 ROBERT ASHMORE in a book, a shi by the Tang poet ZhangJi and, as a song at a ban- quet, a ci by YanJidao-the verbal identity is after all not exact- some such paradoxical amalgam of distinction and identity does seem central to YanJidao's concerns. Our crude analysis of the reference of the key phrase "white-head WangJian," in fact, seems to provide a plausible illustration for the process of "renovation from within" that YanJidao announced as the guiding intention of the composi- tion of his banquet songs: that phrase, which when read as part of a shi, a text in a book, provided consolation to ZhangJi, can no longer provide Yan Jidao consolation in the same way; the same phrase, when construed in the context of a banquet song, is given a new referent, and a new capacity to cheer the poet and his convivial audience. As for the fact that YanJidao is able to express his feel- ings in this particular moment of shared conviviality by only the slight- est modification of the words of a long-dead writer, we may simply recall the words of YanJidao's preface-"the feelings stirred by the affairs of the world have never changed, from antiquity up to the present." The story of the reference of this phrase within Yan Jidao's song is, however, more complicated. For, if we take it that the natural way of construing the phrase "white-head Wang Jian" within Yan Jidao's banquet song will be to take it as referring to one of the par- ticipants at the banquet, then we are faced with a situation in which what was a proper noun within the source text has come to func- tion, through quotation, somehow like a pronoun, or, to borrow a term from linguistics, a "shifter."51 By our reading, the phrase refers to a living presence in YanJidao's song just as it does in ZhangJi's poem. Perhaps the use of the phrase in the banquet song includes as well the implicit message that "I am consoled by your presence, just as ZhangJi was consoled by the presence of his friend WangJian." But where ZhangJi's poem arrived at a relatively unproblematic sense 51 A "shifter" is defined as a grammatical unit whose meaning is only determin- able by reference to its context within a given utterance; thus "I" can only be defined as "the person saying 'I' in this utterance," demonstratives such as "this" and "that" refer to a frame of reference keyed to the respective positions of sender and addressee, and so on. The term has come to be primarily associated with Roman Jakobson's essay "Shifters, Verbal Categories, and the Russian Verb," in Roman Jakobson: Selected Writings (The Hague &amp; Paris: Mouton, 1971), 2.131-147. As Jakobson points out, however, the term originated with Otto Jespersen. See Jespersen's Language: Its Nature, Development, and Origin (London: Allen and Unwin, [1922] 1964), 123-4.</page><page sequence="27">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 237 of closure with its faith in the power of the phrase "white-head Wang Jian" to designate a particular presence, does not the use of that same phrase as a "shifter" within YanJidao's song rather pointedly offer up "consoling presence" under the sign of futility and loss? Part of the "argument" of Yan Jidao's song, of course, is a restatement of the recurring verities of banquet song-"all but the present moment is fleeting, unreal, unreliable; therefore take what pleasure you can, here and now." Yet the quotational use of past poetry in this song lends an extra air of desperation to this appeal to the present mo- ment, as the appeal is made in terms that expose it as merely a rep- etition of past moments, and seem further haunted by an intimation that these words, and these sentiments, will in turn be repeated by others. Having examined at such length the function of quotation in this stanza of banquet song, it seems only natural to conclude with a comment or two on the single line interposed between the pair of couplets derived from ZhangJi. The phrase "thinking back on things of the past is prone to set one weeping" seems interposed as a sort of running commentary on the lyric "reperformance" of ZhangJi's poem. Yet as commentary it seems singularly unilluminating, restating in the baldest and most generic terms the kind of sadness expressed in the poem's first couplet. It is the sense that even the immediacy of the "present" of the banquet is already contained within a logic of repetition the sense produced here through the deployment of quotation-that gives this seemingly banal interjection its poignancy. As the appeal to "seize the moment" is eerily shadowed by that past moment shared by ZhangJi and WangJian, the "things of the past" which provoke tears come to include not only the particular per- sonal sorrows of those Tang poets, along with those of Yan Jidao and his guests, but also the more pervasive inability of language to capture and preserve intact the moment's felt particularity. Paradoxi- cally, for YanJidao, such a breakdown into inarticulacy becomes a sort of expressive device of last resort, within a poetics that addresses thematically the entropy to which textual meaning inevitably suc- cumbs.52 52 Concening the second stanza of this song, which has not figured directly in our discussion, it is intriguing to note that, as regards the quotational use of past poetry, it constitutes a sort of mirror image of the first stanza. The third line, "drinking-gatherings, song-parties: don't spurn their frequency" not only alludes, at the level of "content," directly to the idea of banqueting as occurring within a logic of repetition, but is itself, at the level of "mode of expression," the repe-</page><page sequence="28">ROBERT ASHMORE The above reading of YanJidao's adaptation of Tang occasional verse within the framework of a banquet song is meant to suggest some of the ways in which Yan's lyrics, while grounding themselves in the ephemeral pleasures of the moment, at the same time "theo- rize" and reflect on what would conventionally be considered quite serious issues of language, history, literary canon, and performance. One question the "Linjiang xian" song discussed above seems to raise might be expressed as follows: "Does this song, in its performance in the shared 'here and now' of this banquet, represent a successful renewal and continuation of the lyric tradition of the Tang shi, or are both the latter and the former trapped within the same inevi- table process of decay and loss of meaning?" In other words, when viewed in this way the song itself seems to echo the preoccupations of Yan Jidao's preface to the collection. That preface, we recall, went on to consider what happened to the new songs when their own occasion was past, and they in turn became subject to the loss of their informing meaning (yi). In the following, doubtless the most openly "theoretical" ofYanJidao's lyrics, we see this latter moment "put to music": SAWFMtRf _ - ° ff®gXr ^4 [ ff -tg, The drunken parting at the west hall: sober, I can't recall it. Spring dreams, autumn clouds-meeting and parting, just like that. With the moon declining at mid-window, still I lack sleep. Idly, the painted screen unfolds Wu mountains' lush green. Wine-stains on clothes, words in a poem: drip on drop, line after line; signifying, on the whole, melancholy. The red candle, with no stratagem against self-pity, in the cold night vainly drips substitute tears.53 Unlike the lyric to "Linjiang xian" discussed above, which speaks tition of a line from a renowned banquet lyric by Yan Jidao's own father, Yan Shu. See the latter's ci to the tune "Huan xi sha" 4j'ti$, beginning --J1: E T , QSC 90. 53 To the tune, "Die lian hua" Q,, QSC 224. 238</page><page sequence="29">THE BANQUET S AFTERMATH 239 to its listener from within the moment of the banquet, this lyric situ- ates itself in the banquet's aftermath, presenting a speaker gradually coming to after what was apparently an especially boisterous carouse, trying to piece together what happened. In this lyric, even more pointedly than in the previous one, we see that the relation of Yan Jidao's "practice" in his songs to the "theory" of his preface is very much that of variant versions of a single master narrative: this song, while not explicitly echoing the discourse of canonical shi, is every bit as "theoretical" as the preface, treating thematically many of the same issues of immediacy, repetition, and loss, and presenting the same stubborn incommensurability of the "meaningful moment" and its textual traces. It seems no more than stating the obvious, for ex- ample, to observe that the second stanza of this song is a lyric "re- writing" of the closing section of YanJidao's preface. The juxtaposition, or implicit equation, between the two stained surfaces wine-spot- ted clothing and the inked traces of the poems composed or sung at a recent, yet now unrecoverable, banquet-is strongly reminiscent of YanJidao's notion of the "meaning" of lyric as residing in a shared "significant act," in other words, a sort of meaning not circumscribed by "abiding intentions" on the part of the poet.54 The full meaning of song as realized in its shared performance, like the significance of the moment of drunken abandon in which the wine was spilled, is something that "just happens," and whose meaning is exhausted in the happening. The text of the song, in its way, is a faithful token of the event, but only in the strained sense in which we might call the wine-spots, in their own way, a faithful token of the event of spilling. Reading the lyric after the fact, Yan Jidao provokingly asserts, will no more restore the whole of a "meaning" defined as a significant communal act than will staring at wine-stains. Such an interpretive impasse is expressed here by the tone of con- jecture in the phrase, "zong shi qiliangyi," "signifying, on the whole, 54 This is one among many examples in Yan Jidao's banquet songs where the word "shk" seems to designate the text, as opposed to the performance, of any lyric alluded to within banquet song, whichever of our latter-day formal categores of shi and ci that lyric might seem to belong to. If we are justified in reading the term "shk" within Yan Jidao's lyrics in this way, then in one sense this would be simply a reflection of the earlier functional conception of the difference between shi and banquet song; at the same time it is also of a piece with Yan Jidao's more idio- syncratic sense of text as the inadequate trace of meaning which is left over in that meaning's aftermath.</page><page sequence="30">240 ROBERT ASHMORE melancholy;" again, as in the song discussed above, we hear the voice of a rather ineloquent commentator. And, again similarly to the previous song, the commentator's sadness is not circumscribed as the "content" of a verbal message, but extends to include a resigna- tion concerning the futility of messages in general, a haunting sense of a pervasive entropy of meaning: in this case, the "melancholy" alluded to seems less a summing-up of the meaning transmitted through the poem (one hardly imagines the party that apparently took place in the western hall as the sort at which the celebrants would have composed verses on melancholia) than an admission of the would- be interpreter's despondency over the text's stubborn muteness. For YanJidao, as we saw over the course of the narrative contained in his preface, it is simply in the nature of things that the performance that gave meaning to the text passes, and once it has passed, one is left without any means of knowing that meaning-even if one hap- pens to be the text's ostensible author. For everyone, even those who begin as participants in the "meaning" of the poem, there always comes a time at which one is reading "after the fact." The poem's closing image offers another revealing example of Yan Jidao's quotational use of shi. The antecedent text here is a regu- lated quatrain by Du Mu ftfk (803-52), entitled "Presented in Part- ing" OWJ (Number two of two): The full of feeling yet seem ever without feeling; all I notice is that before the cup my laughter never comes. The candle has a "heart" (i.e. wick) and, moreover, feels regret at parting, shedding substitute tears right up till dawn.55 Here the image of the "weeping" candle is deployed along with a series of paradoxes about interior feeling and outward expression. The poet's lack of enthusiasm for the convivial joys of the banquet, which makes him seem to lack feeling, is in fact an index of his par- ticularly deep feelings-he cannot enjoy the banquet because of his awareness of the approaching pain of separation. The second cou- plet then points in a playfully rhetorical way to the candle as an inanimate exemplar of the universality and rightness of such suscep- tibility to sadness at parting, as though to say, "if even the candle, 55 QTS 16.523.5988.</page><page sequence="31">THE BANQUET'S AFTERMATH 241 an inanimate object, feels sad and is moved to tears at the prospect of separation, how much more ought we to be so moved?" The quatrain's two halves are also balanced around an antithesis of cat- egories of human and inanimate, appearance and reality: the poet, who seems to lack feeling because of his despondency at the party, is in fact full of feeling; the candle, which seems to be full of this same feeling of despondency due to its shedding of "tears," is in fact an inanimate object-the real feeling belongs, again, to the poet, whom we imagine staring at the slowly dripping candle through a long and sleepless night. The anthropomorphic treatment of the candle in Du Mu's poem, with the verbal pun on the candle's "heart" and the visual pun on its "tears," is deployed in such a way as to point to and rhetorically heighten a claim about the speaker's interiority; while the very wit and rhetorical polish of the poem may cast doubt on just how despondent the poet may have been, nothing in the poem casts doubt on our ability to distinguish between emotions and their outward expression, or between the speaker's feelings and the drip- ping of a candle-nor, in a general sense, is there anything to call into question the poem's own status as a record of a moment of height- ened emotion. The same cannot be said for Yan Jidao's use of the image of the weeping candle at the close of his "Die lian hua" lyric. Rather than situating this image in a rhetorical structure in which it may be read simply as an expression of interiority, YanJidao's poem surrounds the image with unsettling resonances the spilling wine, the dribbling ink, and the collapse of faith in either to "express" any- thing beyond their own mute surfaces and the consternation of their viewer-which implicate the text of the lyric itself. As we saw at the close of Yan's preface, and as we see again in this lyric, the sense of insubstantiality arising from the inability of text to capture past ex- perience ends by invading the present tense as well, as the sense of resignation about language leads to a sort of negation of any interi- ority, in which the dripping candle's spatter proves neither more nor less faithful or adequate an expression of the lived moment than the poet's words or tears.

Reading his preface against the con- ventions of literary prefaces in general, and of prefaces to ci in par- ticular, we see that part of what makes that piece of writing so baffling is its refusal to situate the songs it introduces in any clear external relation to the "high" canon and to the public modes of writing that constitute wenzhang. Interestingly, we observe a similar mixture of penetration and idiosyncracy, along with a resistance to definitive categorization within the realm of public life and letters, in the fig- ure of the poet himself as he appears to us in the few contemporary and near-contemporary accounts that survive. In the eyes of the society and intellectual culture of his time, YanJidao appears as eminently up-to-date, in step with the most innovative intellectual and aesthetic trends, much sought-after as a conversationalist and companion; yet, at the same time, as hopelessly out of touch, with a lack of adapt- ability to social norms that, it is frequently implied, resulted directly in what was, considering his talents and background, a singularly undistinguished public career.56 We will conclude this essay, then, with a brief consideration of these paradoxes of YanJidao's charac- ter as viewed in the context of contemporary norms of public action and expression, and with some general comments on his odd rela- tion, as a writer and as a member of society, to the "proprieties" of genre and of behavior. We noted above that the preface to Yan Jidao's banquet songs alludes to and borrows from-if it does not in the end fully belong to-the theoretical and scholarly discourse on the high canon of shi poetry, and in particular the Odes. In fact, in its broad outlines, the model Yan Jidao constructs for thinking about history, text, and meaning bears striking similarities with some of the most radical trends in Northern-Song canonical scholarship. When Yan Jidao, in his preface, says, the feelings stirred by the affairs of the world have never changed, from an- tiquity up to the present. So I make bold to suggest: the meaning in the poem must not have escaped people in the old days; it is simply that there is noth- 56 The best assembly of documentation on Yan Jidao's life is Xia Chengtao's chronological study of Yan Jidao and his father Yan Shu, Er ran nianpu.

Therefore I collectively designate the things I have composed as "filling in what is missing," one may feel that the application of this form of argument to a dis- cussion of a collection of banquet songs is somewhat bizarre, yet one can hardly escape the impression here that one is reading a precis of the tendencies in canonical scholarship that were to become associ- ated with the label "Song studies" . The story of canonical studies in the Northern Song is precisely one of increased emphasis on the tenuousness of the textual links with the meanings of the sages, as doubt is cast on increasingly broader swathes of the commentarial traditions of the Han and Tang;57 this tendency goes hand in hand with an increased confidence that the meaning of the sages is realiz- able in the present tense, that the world within which the sages' in- tentions were formulated is essentially the same world as that of their latter-day students.58 A pair of quotes from Liu Kai {WJ3f (947-1000), one of the fore- runners of this brand of scholarship in the Northern Song, can serve to indicate these two "moments" in Song thought about canon and continuity, as well as to suggest the pallette of associations against which YanJidao's preface would have been read by his contempo- raries. The following are excerpts from Liu Kai's quasi-autobiographi- cal "Biography of Mr. Buwang": TL-fi ` ,lM 2M , A 1ot4te @ Xt ; i MI a If P EfL m T f122 tAt 21 r R_;;I2g L After the death of Confucius, the texts of the canon fell victim to the destruc- tion and burning of the Qin, and came near to being lost completely. As for those of later times who collected those remnants of cinder and ash, so that we can use them today, among those who were able to continue the work of Master Kong, since the time of Ke [=Mencius], even someone of the stature of Yang Xiong did not dare add a single word, with the result that the lost pieces are missing, yet their names are all recorded, creating empty spaces, 5 In terms of YanJidao's phrase, "it is simply that there is nothing to transmit it to us today" ; what Northern Song canonical scholarship increas- ingly casts doubt on is the capacity of the "traditions of commentagy" (both concepts linked to the word zhuan f4) to "transmit" (chuan f{) the sages' meaning. 58 See Pi Xirui, Jingxue lishi ' (Taibei: Yiwen yinshuguan, 1996), chap- ter 8. For an excellent and detailed survey of the history of Odes scholarship in particular during this period, see Van Zoeren, chs. 6 and 7.

The severity of this problem is implied from the fact that no one, of all the scholars from the time of the Qin book-burning to the present, has succeeded in compensating for that catastrophic loss. This stark vision of the canon as a concat- enation of fragments, however, serves in Liu Kai's narrative as a foil for the wondrous action of "Mr. Buwang," who, having gained an intuitive grasp of the whole meaning of the canon, is able to restore it through a compensating act of mind: 4pabiL&gt; - n Jt 19o t EI R;qAtopoffif" ;Z51it X 1 5t f 9 W : c:X W V iF r- 5Y-,* J -ft wA - He began by devoting his mind exhaustively to the Odes and Documents so as to gain a fine grasp of the things hidden there. Often, facing these books, he would sigh, "Ah! It is by this that I recognize the great points of our former Teacher [i.e. Confucius]. How unfortunate that there are parts missing, which I am unable to see! I do not yet know what further additions there would have been to the words of the sages." And then even more he extended his grasp of the wondrous in the remaining classics, and thereupon took each of the lost parts of the classics and filled them in: in each case where the tradition assigned a significance [to the lost piece], he wrote it according to that; for those without [such traditions], he once more brought forth both the words and the significance. Therefore he took the cognomen "Master Filling-in-what- is-missing."60 In the immediately following passage, Liu Kai emphasizes that each of these "filled-in" writings was composed all at once, as the unitary expression of a single moment's insight. These long-standing textual lacunae in the canon are thus remedied, not through the methods of conventional scholars, whose knowledge is limited to the scope of surviving texts, but rather through a spontaneous and unitary act of intuition that glimpses the meaning of the canon in its original whole- ness. 5 Hedongji jQ , (Siku quanshu edition [hereafter SKQS]), 2.9A (1085.249).

That Yan Jidao was familiar with trends in this field ought not to be surprising. We may note, for ex- ample, that two of the most influential figures in Odes hermeneutics of the period, Ouyang Xiu and Cheng Yi fV1 (1033-1107), were both intimates of the Yan household. YanJidao would thus almost surely have been familiar, in one form or another, with Ouyang Xiu's approach to interpreting the Odes, which gives a central place to the "meaning" (yi t) of the poet as forming the core of the Ode, and based on which it is sometimes possible to reveal the inadequacies of the commentarial tradition. One of the grounds on which Ouyang Xiu believes such a reconstruction of an original "meaning" is pos- sible, moreover, is the fundamental identity of human feeling be- tween ancient times and the present: Though the text of the Ode is laconic and easy, yet it is able to fully express human affairs to the minutest detail. Moreover, human feeling in antiquity and in the present is one and the same; if one seeks the significance of the Ode by means of [this common] human feeling, then one will not be far off.6' If one were to try to read YanJidao as making a claim about these issues, of course, his position would necessarily be a far more radical one. For Ouyang Xiu, the canonical text of the Ode still plays a vital role; the asserted identity of human feeling assures that the horizon for the original "meaning" of the poet and that for the reconstructed "meaning" of the reader are commensurate, but the function of the canonical text is by no means negated. The normative capacity of the canonical text to "express fully human affairs in every contour" remains an essential link in the chain of operations that makes con- tinuity with the ancients a realizable possibility, rather than an empty postulate. YanJidao's position again, if we force ourselves to read him within the discourse of "Song studies"-with its radical empha- sis on thefeelings themselves as the only locus of continuity, and its cor- 61 Ouyang Xiu, Shi benyi 34I*A (SKQS ed.), 6.8B (70.222). As Stephen Van Zoeren has shown, the thesis of the identity of human feeling in antiquity and the present-an idea with potentially iconoclastic implications for the authority of the intervening commentarial tradition-is only one dimension of Ouyang Xiu's quite complex and qualified position on the relation between the canon, the present-day reader's judgment and intuition, and the intervening layers of tradition. For an in- depth discussion, see Van Zoeren, op. cit., 159-89.</page><page sequence="36">ROBERT ASHMORE responding denial of the efficacy of any text to mediate that conti- nuity on its own, seems almost an anticipation of the position of Lu Jiuyuan's famous dictum, "the six classics are all annotations to me" A1ggtR&gt;tgi 62 To venture such a connection, however, is to involve oneself in an absurdity. YanJidao, after all, is not taking a position in the fields of Odes scholarship, or of moral philosophy, but, rather, is writing a preface to a collection of banquet songs. Is not an attempt to read such a text within the discourse of canonical hermeneutics to take it "too seriously"? As we have seen, however, the preface itself both invites such "overreading" and then undercuts it. The terms of the preface's self-consuming argument invoke the discourse of the "high" tradition, only to circumscribe the range of their application, to re- mind us that, after all, these are merely banquet songs. This gesture- the suggestion of broad connections to shared cultural concerns, followed by the circumscribing qualification, the insistence on the private-is basic to the rhetorical rhythm of the preface, and is es- tablished in its opening phrases: "Filling in what is missing... that is, filling in what is missing in yuefu, or banquet songs." Later in the preface, on the heels of the statement of the thesis on the perma- nence of human feeling and the inadequacy of textual tradition, Yan Jidao abruptly turns to a circumstantial and pointedly private account of the banquets formerly attended by himself, ChenJunlong, Shen Lianshu, and the singing-girls Lian, Hong, Pin, and Yun. This odd relation to the discursive norms of formal, "high" public writing, we may recall, is in a sense enacted as well in the way YanJidao's banquet song preface relates to the generic conventions of the literary xu, and in the very fact of showing such a serious engagement with compo- sitions in a form which was broadly considered as an idle pastime. Such "idiosyncracies," as they must have appeared, bring us face to face with the "untranslatable" side of YanJidao, his insistence on an "idiom" that does not transfer squarely into the public realm of wenzhang, what one admirer among his contemporaries termed his "idiocy" (chi g): W., I W A;i g ^f k -L, T_t O a ~ , i .

Yan Shuyuan [= YanJidao] is the son of the old age of the lord of Linzi.63 Bold and forthright in manner, of a clever and unconventional cast of mind, his observance of social taboo tends to be lax. In literary composition he has established standards of his own; he is forever wanting to rank the achieve- ments of others, yet does not accept the world's evaluation of himself. All the men of position were fond of him, yet faulted him for an excessive punctili- ousness in small things,64 and thus he has remained mired in the lower ranks of officialdom. Throughout his life he has submerged his mind in the six clas- sics, and pondered the works of all the schools of the learned; his opinions on such matters are exceedingly sophisticated, yet he has never once used such attainments to seek worldly advantage. Once I asked him about this-find- ing it an odd thing-and he said, "Even shambling along unassumingly as I do, I earn the ire of those men of position; to take offense and tell them what I think would be to spit in their faces." And so he merely disports himself in the remnants ofyuefu; and yet he imbues in these works the versification of the poets (shiren J",.): pure and vigorous, with a surging style, these works can deeply stir the mind. Scholar-officials and court gentlemen circulate them, finding merely that they possess the manner of the lord of Linzi-few can truly discern the flavor of these phrases. I once delivered the following assess- ment of Shuyuan: "He is indeed a man of outstanding talents; yet his idiocy is also without compare." Certain others who were fond of Shuyuan became angry, and demanded to know in detail the reasoning behind this opinion of mine. I said, "While always mired in difficulty in his official career, he is unable to put in a single appearance at the gates of a prominent person-this is is one idiocy. In discussing writing, he has a style all his own, yet he is not will- ing to compose a single one of the sort of things the newjinshi graduates write- this is another idiocy. He incurs expenditures of several tens of millions; his family is hungry and cold, and yet his face still has the complexion of a young child-this is another idiocy. People can betray him a hundred times and he will not resent it; once he has put trust in someone he will never by any means suspect him of cheating him-this is another idiocy." And with this, they all agreed that I was right.65 Huang Tingjian's discussion of YanJidao is suggestive in the way in which it draws connections between issues of the literary genre and personal ethos, and YanJidao's anomalous relation to the "pro- prieties" of each. At the most general level, we are reminded that 63 Yan Shu, who, besides being an accomplished writer of banquet ci, was one of the most powerful political figures of the mid-eleventh-century Song court. 64 J i1 S . 65 Huang Tingjian i~i , "Xiaoshan ji xu" /J\LlF}, in Shangu ji LUIH- (SKQS ed.), 16.21A-22A (1113.147).

It seems only natural in a sense, then, that he might feel an unquestioning confidence in his own personal "quality" and scorn to seek confirmation of it in the opinion of society. Whether circumstantially true or not, the fol- lowing anecdote reveals a great deal about the way YanJidao's per- sonality was viewed by contemporaries: During the Yuanyou period (1086-93), Shuyuan had gained renown through his song lyrics. Su Zizhan [= Shi] wanted to pay a call on him, using Luzhi [= Huang Tingjian] as an intermediary. But [Yan] begged off, saying, "Half the men now serving in the Administration Chamber are former clients of my family-and I don't have time to see them either."66 At the dramatic date of this anecdote, both Su Shi and YanJidao would have been around fifty years old. Su Shi would have been one of the most renowned literary lions of the age, with an immense, if controversial, reputation as a public figure; while YanJidao was living in a mansion belonging to his family at the capital, having taken an early retirement from his rather lackluster public career.67 The anecdote is memorable exactly because of the unexpected reversal of status claims that it involves: in the eyes of the world, a relative unknown who happens to have gained some notoriety as an author of banquet songs ought to be deeply flattered by the attentions of a literary and cultural icon such as Su Shi; yet YanJidao, unflappable, responds with a cool sense of his own private standards of personal worth, noting blandly that virtually an entire generation of upwardly mobile intellectuals had at one time or another been hangers-on of his father's household. The figure of Su Shi in this anecdote leads us naturally to con- sider the specifically literary dimension of Huang Tingjian's discus- sion of YanJidao's odd relation to "proprieties." According to Huang, YanJidao, while undoubtedly possessed of an immense literary tal- ent, shows a baffling unwillingness to direct that talent in forms that might earn him social acceptance or advancement-his "idiocy" consists, among other things, in his unwillingness to write "the sort of thing the new jinshi graduates write." Yan Jidao's haughty self- 66 Lu Youren YI, ranbei zazhi iff (SKQS ed.), 1.6A (866.565).

Intellec- tual historians of this period are familiar with the way in which such misgivings about contemporary literary tastes and literati ethos motivated the call of thinkers such as Cheng Yi to a more authentic, personal engagement with the Confucian canon; YanJidao, in pro- posing his vision of an intimate, spontaneous community of banqueters as a kind of "filling in" of something lost in that community's rela- tion to tradition, may, in his own peculiar fashion, be doing some- thing not entirely dissimilar. Yan Jidao and Su Shi both stand at the end of the relatively "untheorized" tradition of banquet lyric, of what has been referred to here as the form's "prehistory." Strangely, their respective posi- tions in relation to that tradition of -"practical banquet song," far removed though they may seem, are in a sense complementary, for both address the end of that tradition. Su Shi, by making the form a vehicle for the self-expression of a literary celebrity, and by adding to the form the autobiographical prefaces which tell the reader when and under what circumstances the song was composed, pushes the form in the direction of full "textuality"-even if such songs are performed at banquets, they can never be simply "words to a tune," but will have become "the song written by Su Shi on such and such an occasion." YanJidao's awareness of his songs as text is far more enigmatic, and fraught with paradox. He does address readers of his songs through his preface-albeit only in order, ultimately, to claim that the meanings of those songs are both utterly private and irrevo- cably lost. Su Shi performs before an admiring audience as the master of the full gamut of literary genres, able to subdue each to the free and exuberant expression of his personality. YanJidao presents himself to a reading public only to turn his back on it, and presents a per- sona that seems ignorant or oblivious of any form of writing other than his beloved songs, though within that restricted gamut he may seem, to a sympathetic reader, to include the whole range and power of the literary tradition-"the 'Greater Elegantiae' of the world of pleasure," in the words of Huang Tingjian.68 This particular brand 68 , The phrase is from the preface discussed above.

Readers weary of the demands of literary and social "seriousness" could vicariously enjoy the free play and lively abandon of banquets shared by like- minded revelers-and share as well in the author's nostalgia know- ing, as he did, that those banquets are, from the horizon of the reader of those songs, irrevocably past.</page></plain_text>
