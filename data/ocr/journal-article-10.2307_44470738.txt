ABSTRACT This paper presents a review on pedestrian impact reconstruction methodology and offers a comprehensive review of tne literature. Several types of analyses are discussed which can be used to reconstruct the accident scenar- io using the facts collected from the scene. Inclusive in this review is the utilization of skid mark analysis, debris analysis, injury/ damage match-up, trajectory analysis, nighttime visibility, and alcohol effects. The pedes- trian impact reconstruction methodology is illustrated with a real world case example to point out different observations which can provide insight into the pedestrian/vehicle collision reconstruction approach. The litera- ture review provides a broad foundation of information on pedestrian impact reconstruction and can be used to supplement the techniques presented in this paper in areas related to pedestrian impact. Research advances in the area of pedestri- an impact reconstruction are also discussed in this paper. Results from research investiga- tion and experimental studies provide the reconstructionist with statistical information on the pedestrian pre- and post-impact action as well as vehicle impact speed and braking. PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN a threat to society ever since the introduction of land vehicles. It is conjectured that pedestrian accidents were commonplace when a Roman chariot would thunder without warning into the city through a group of people standing in the marketplace. Similarly, with the invention of the automobile, an even greater threat was launched against the pedestrian society. Today, nearly 150,000 pedestrian accidents occur each year in the United States and some 8,000 pedestrians are fatally injured as a result of pedestrian/vehicle collisions (131). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was established in 1968 and became involved in the pedestrian accident problem in 1971 (288). The NHTSA created a public awareness of the magnitude of the pedes- trian accident problem and strove to reduce its extent through research and education. Since that time, several technical papers have been published concerning pedestrian accident recon- struction and pedestrian research. A comprehensive bibliography covering this literature is presented here as a basic refer- ence tool . The purpose of this paper is to provide a reference for reconstructing pedestrian acci- dents by offering both practical investigative techniques and a bibliographical reference for addressing related topics. This paper does not concentrate on ancillary aspects of vehicle accidents such as vehicle speed calculations covered elsewhere (i.e., Baker, 40), but rather will point out special features of pedestrian impact reconstruction which, when used in con- junction with traditional accident investiga- tion materials, will provide a complete refer- ence for pedestrian impact reconstructions. RECONSTRUCTION PHILOSOPHY An accident reconstructionist is a techni- cal expert that collects and analyzes informa- tion about an accident in order to determine (or reconstruct) the events of the accident. The process of collecting and analyzing facts follows a general investigative pattern of answering the following six questions: 1 . Who? 2. What? 3. Where? 4. When? 5. Why? 6 . How? The first four questions encompass the facts of the accident typically available including such things as names, vehicle involved, location of accident, time/place, injury/damage patterns, and scene damage. This information can be gleaned from accident reports, taken from witness statements, or obtained first-hand by inspection of the vehicle and scene. The question of how the accident happened is often 2.844 0096-736X/88/9602-0844$02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">870605 the focal point of the reconstruction. It is the reason the reconstruction is being under- taken in the first place. Why the accident occurred is often more difficult to determine from a scientific analysis since it involves the thought processes of the participants in the accident. These thoughts are often not available or are altered with time, either consciously or subconsciously. In spite of this limitation, the facts can sometimes be used to explain why the driver or pedestrian took a particular action. The accuracy with which a reconstructionist can answer the six questions depends largely upon the quantity and quality of information which is discoverable about the accident. In order to collect pertinent facts for reconstructing an accident, an investigator must be aware of the observations which are required for the analyses. This will be illustrated with the aid of a real world accident example. PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENT EXAMPLE On an overcast November morning, the driver of a 1978 Ford Thunderbird impacted a senior citizen, male pedestrian on a two-lane rural highway. The driver stated that he had just traveled over a hill when he saw a pedes- trian in the roadway. It was the driver's opinion that the pedestrian was walking to the mailbox from the driveway. When the pedestrian had traveled just past the road centerline, he turned, saw the vehicle, and proceeded to return to his driveway. The driver reacted to this situation with a panic application of his brakes. The pedestrian then jumped up into the air to avoid the oncoming vehicle. The vehicle impacted the pedestrian while he was in the air with its right front facia and leading edge. The pedestrian vaulted over the right fender, impacted the roadway, and tumbled to his final resting point. OBSERVATIONS A thorough documentation of evidence from the accident scene can provide sufficient data from which to reconstruct the accident. Clues are left behind every accident. These clues, if observed, could describe most of the speci- fic details about the impact scenario. There- fore, it is important to document all of the necessary information in order to have a strong basis from which to reconstruct the pedes- trian/vehicle collision. The cited pedestrian accident case was investigated one week after the accident had occurred. The vehicle and accident scene were available for inspection and the driver of the vehicle provided further information as well. This is not always the case. An investigator may only have available a police report, witness statements, photographs, and injury records. The ordering of this list corresponds to the decreasing likelihood of the availabi- lity of the respective materials. In addition, inspection of the accident scene can be essen- tial. However, if the reconstruction is being conducted years after the accident, skidmarks will be gone, the road may be repaved, or a shopping center may now occupy the accident site. Also, the vehicle may have been sold or destroyed. This means that no measurements of the accident scene or vehicle could be person- ally documented and makes the initial investi- gation of the accident more important. Several observations which contribute to successfully reconstructing a pedestrian accident are as follows: 1. Vehicle identification 2. Accident scene identification 3. Vehicle damage 4. Pedestrian injuries 5. Skid marks and roadway mapping 6. Debris (vehicle or pedestrian) 7. Transfers 8. Visibility 9. Witness statements 10. Alcohol levels (driver and pedestri- an) The detection and documentation of these general observations should provide sufficient data to reconstruct most pedestrian accident scenarios. There are essentially two phases involved in determining the sequence of events that leƒè up to a pedestrian accident. These are the investigation or documentation of the facts and the application of scientific principles to these facts. The first phase if often con- ducted at least in part by the investigating officer at the time of the accident. A recon- structionist then takes existing recorded information, obtains more if available, and then performs the actual reconstruction. The investigation referred to in the following text refers to that portion executed by the recon- structionist to fill in missing information. The first observation to note when inves- tigating a pedestrian accident is the accurate identification of the vehicle and accident scene. Scene identification can be a problem if many accidents have occurred in the area of interest or if no written record of the accident location exists. Once identified, the vehicle and accident scene can be scrutinized for information that will reveal what happened during the collision. This information should be documented with photographs and mea- surements. An overall view of the vehicle involved in the example is shown in Figure 1. The damage to the vehicle occurred on the right side. A minor dent was observed at the leading edge above the headlight, as shown in Figure 2. Blue fibrous streaks, as well as an indentation indentation, were noticed on the hood edge which corresponded to the blue jeans that the pedestrian was wearing (Figure 3). Also, a green transfer was found near a dent in the bumper directly below the headlight as can be viewed in Figure 4. This green transfer was caused by the pedestrian's shoe when it im- pacted the bumper and it agrees with the driver's observation that the pedestrian was wearing green shoes. The location of the transfer indicates that the pedestrian had jumped up immediately prior to impacting the vehicle. Another dent was found on the right side at the edge of the hood where it meets the 2.845</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 Overall view of subject vehicle (1978 Ford Thunderbird) Fig. 2 Residual damage to right front of vehicle Fig. 3 Blue fibrous streaks on damaged area Fig. 4 Green shoe transfer on bumper fender. This dent corresponds to the head impact of the pedestrian. This dent can be viewed in Figure 5. The radio antenna was bent at approximately a 15 degree angle with the side of the vehicle, as can be seen in Figure 6, revealing the escape route of the pedes- trian. The skid marks displayed in Figures 7 and 8 were made by the left front tire of the subject vehicle. As can be seen from the photographs, these skid marks are in three sections of 68, 18, and 23 feet long, respec- tively. The total skid length is therefore 109 feet. A scaled drawing of the accident scene was constructed, complete with skid marks to observe the travel path of the vehicle in relationship to the travel path of the pedes- trian. The only debris that was noticed in the roadway was a blood spot in the driver's lane where the pedestrian came to rest. This spot is pointed out in Figure 9. The pedestrian's injuries could not be documented with a medical report. However, the driver stated that the pedestrian sustained a concussion and a broken leg.

It was determined that the driver could first see the pedestrian at a distance of 500 feet prior to impact. Figure 10 is a view of the accident scene at 500 feet prior to impact from the view of the driver. Visibility was obstructed by a rise in the road between the pedestrian and the oncoming vehicle. It was stated in the police report on this pedestrian accident that no witnesses saw this accident actually happen. Further, it was noted in this report that the pedestrian had a blood alcohol level of 0.20%. The driver was found to be sober. RECONSTRUCTION ANALYSIS In most pedestrian accident reconstruc- tions, the four accident scenario details which are often asked are: 1) vehicle traveling speed, 2) vehicle impact speed, 3) point of impact, and 4) impact avoidance. Reconstruc- Fig. 10 Driver's view of accident location at 500 feet before impact 2.847</page><page sequence="5">2.848 tion analyses can be performed to evaluate the impact details once all the pertinent facts of the pedestrian impact have been collected and documented. Depending on the quantity and quality of information collected and the scenario details desired, a number of analyses can be performed to evaluate the details of the scenario including injury/damage match-up, skid, debris, trajectory, night time visibili- ty, and alcohol effects. TRAVELING SPEED - The vehicle traveling speed is defined as the speed of the vehicle prior to initiation of braking. The vehicle traveling speed can be determined from measure- ments of the skid marks relative to the final resting place. In cases where there is no braking, the traveling speed is the same as the impact speed since this is an indication that braking was not initiated prior to impact. The traveling speed of the vehicle can be calcu- lated from the following equation (72): V =^30fd (1) V = vehicle velocity (mph) f = coefficient of friction of tire on road d = distance of skid mark (ft.) The traveling speed for this example case was found to be approximately 50 mph. Velocity evaluation from skid mark data is well documented: (40, 72, 107). These refer- ences provide measured values of the coeffi- cient of friction for numerous objects on various surfaces. This information can be used to select an appropriate coefficient of fric- tion for the stated road and vehicle condi- tions. In many cases the skid mark measurements must be taken from police reports or photo- graphs. Measurements can also be derived from photographs by means of photogrammetric analy- sis. Photogrammetry involves super-imposing an accident scene photograph on another photograph of the scene which contains landmarks of known dimensions. For accuracy, these landmarks are often a gridwork marked off by the ^construc- tionist. The skid marks in the photograph can then be measured by comparison with the known dimensions. IMPACT SPEED - The impact speed of the vehicle is simply defined as the speed of the vehicle immediately prior to impact with the pedestrian. The impact speed of the vehicle can be determined from information about the point of impact and final resting place of the vehicle and pedestrian. A skid mark analysis can be performed if skid marks are present from the point of impact to final rest. This is similar to the traveling speed evaluation with the corresponding distance used in skid equa- tion (1). In the absence of skid marks, the impact speed may be approximated by a trajectory analysis, providing the point of impact and final resting place of the pedestrian are known. A typical method for performing a trajectory analysis is to model the pedestrian as a projectile after impact and calculate a bound for the velocity by estimating a range for the angle of projection (88). This tech- nique, however, assumes that the point of first landing of the pedestrian is known. This point is usually not defined by available evidence. The position of the pedestrian recorded on a police report or documented with blood on the pavement is usually the final rest position. Searle presents an analysis of the projection velocity for a given total pedestrian trajectory including the initial flight and subsequent impacts (244). He gives an upper and lower bound on the projection velocity as: ^min 1+P (2) Vm=.v =*/2ugs for e&lt;ecrit (3) max w V = (Undefined) for e¬ªecrit (4) max √©crit = 180¬∞ - 2 ATAN(√¨) (5) A Lower bound on projection min = velocity (Ft/S) Vmav wx A Upper bound on projection wx = velocity (Ft/S) u A Coefficient of friction between = pedestrian and roadway (usually 0.6-0.8) S ^ - Distance from point of impact - to final rest (Ft) g A Gravitational constant = 32.2 Ft, at sea level S¬ø e ¬£ Projection angle (deg) √©crit A Critical projection angle (deg) This estimate of pedestrian projection velocity can provide a good estimate of the impact speed of the vehicle. Collins (72) also provides an analysis for determining tne impact speed of the vehicle from the total pedestrian trajectory. The impact speed of the vehicle involved in this pedestrian accident example case was calculated from skid equation (1) with a skid distance of 41 feet to be 30 mph. The skid distance was based on an approximate location of the point of impact as discussed below. POINT OF IMPACT - The point of impact between the pedestrian and the striking vehicle can be located using a combination of analyses. These analyses include debris, injury/damage match-up, and skid mark path versus pedestrian travel path. A debris analysis can be con- ducted to determine where the vehicle was on the road at the time of impact, while the</page><page sequence="6">870605 injury/damage match-up technique determines the orientation and location of the pedestrian relative to the vehicle. The skid mark path coupled with its intersection with the pedes- trian travel path can be used to further establish where the vehicle and pedestrian were located relative to the road if any skid marks exist. Severy, Baker, and others have discussed the detection of debris from a collision as an indication of the general area in which direct contact occurred in a collision. This analysis can be applied to pedestrian impacts as well since direct contact occurs at the initiation of the collision between pedestrian and vehicle. In most pedestrian accidents, very little major damage is incurred by the striking vehicle. However, the pedestrian often leaves debris behind such as shoes and other articles of clothing to mark a general impact location on the roadway. These observations do not stay at the accident scene long and may only be discovered accurately by police documentation. The point of impact on the vehicle can be determined from observations of the damage induced by the pedestrian impact. Pedestrians will sometimes leave transfers from clothing, shoes, or blood on the vehicle damage to document the impact area. Combining these observations with the pedestrian injuries can provide insight into the pedestrian kinematics and impact orientation. The damage to the vehicle coupled with the injuries sustained by the pedestrian are also an indirect measure of the collision severity. The point of impact of the example pedes- trian accident could not be calculated from a projection velocity analysis since this pedes- trian impact was a fender vault and the pedestrian was not projected directly forward. The point of impact was estimated by noting the reported intended path of the pedestrian and the skid path of the vehicle. This observation located the point of impact between 75 to 90 feet from the final resting place and 4.5 to 6.5 feet into the roadway from the near-side edgel ine. IMPACT AVOIDANCE - Another accident situa- tion which can be relevant to the pedestrian accident reconstructionist is impact avoidance. Impact avoidance will be defined herein as the ability of the driver, pedestrian, or both to take preventive action in the moments before an accident becomes inevitable. Steps have been taken to assist in pedestrian/vehicle collision avoidance such as designing roadways and pedes- trian paths to be independent. Also, education is being provided to inform the public of pedestrian hazards as well as the legal penal- ties which can be imposed for infringing upon the laws that govern the interaction of pedes- trians and traffic (130). However, even with better roadway designs and public education, pedestrian/vehicle collisions still occur largely due to a degradation of ability to take preventive action. This loss of ability is caused by darkness, fog, rain, snow, obstacles, driving fatigue, alcohol, and drugs. Research on the degradation of this ability is concen- trated in the area of visibility and how this is affected by darkness and alcohol. Visibility may be defined as the clearness with which objects stand out from their sur- roundings (124). An ample visibility distance must be greater than the total stopping dis- tance of the vehicle. The total stopping distance of a vehicle can be determined from knowledge of the time it takes to bring the vehicle to a halt including both reaction and stopping times. This period has been divided into the following components (128): 1) perception, 2) decision, 3) brake reaction, and 4) braking to stop. The total time required to perceive, decide, and initiate braking has been estimated to be 2.3 seconds for the fiftieth percentile and 4.6 seconds for the ninety-ninth percentile adult. Collins (72) sites a minimum perception-reaction time of 1.5 seconds to take evasive action on a road hazard. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has established a percep- tion- reaction time specification of 2.5 seconds with which to design roadways (128). Although the research to date has found it difficult to design a true surprise obstacle test, the data indicates that the time required to perceive and apply the brakes is between 2.0 and 2.5 seconds for the fiftieth percentile adult. The total stopping distance of the vehicle can be found by multiplying this perception-reaction time by the vehicle tra- veling speed and adding the distance required to brake to a stop, as seen in equation (6). TSD = VT (tp_R) + BD (6) TSD A Total Stopping Distance (Ft) Vj ¬£ Traveling Speed (Ft/S) tp p ¬£ Total Perception-Reaction Time (Sec) BD ¬£ Total Braking Distance (Ft) Ample visibility distance in daylight is provided if the total stopping distance is less than the eye can clearly see. With the introduction of alcohol and/or darkness, the ability to take evasive action will be degraded. Hazlett addressed this topic directly and found that: "Roadway tests without alcohol show that with low-beam headlights in an automobile traveling at 40 mph, an alert healthy driver looking for a pedestrian-sized object will not see it soon enough more than 50 percent of the time if the object is covered with black or gray fabric. Pedestrian-sized objects covered with white fabric or grey fabric and a 1" x 11" reflective material will be seen soon enough, but as alcohol is introduced, only the reflectorized object remains safely visible for a 40 mph speed (123)." 2.849</page><page sequence="7">RECONSTRUCTION RESEARCH Research in the area of pedestrian impact reconstruction was prompted by NHTSA in the early 1970 ' s . The objective of this research was to evaluate the possibility of preventing and/or reducing the severity of pedestrian/vehicle collisions. This research may be classified into three groups as follows: pedestrian pre-impact actions, pedestrian post- impact kinematics, and pedestrian injury mitigation. The basic functions performed by pedestrian impact research may be summarized as follows: 1. Statistical analysis of accident data. 2. Documentation of pedestrian/vehicle impact characteristics through accident reconstruction. 3. Mitigation of vehicle impact charac- teristics to improve pedestrian impact survival. In the Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Study/ Highway Safety Act of 1973 (289), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration performed a statistical analysis on pre-impact motions of pedestrians involved in accidents. The seven most frequent pre-impact motions which were discovered are: dart out (33%), intersection dash (9%), vehicle turn-attention conflict (8%), multiple threat (3%), bus stop related (3%), vendor related (2%), and backing up (2%). Further statistics on pedestrian accidents indicate that most occur in an urban area and on the near side of the vehicle (55%) (16). Children were found to be in a running position 76 percent of the time while adults were in that position only 25 percent of the time (16). Further, it has been discovered that a large majority of pedestrian impacts occur to the front of the vehicle (67%) (226), and at speeds below 50 km/h [31 mph] (95%) (16). Research on pedestrian post-impact kinema- tics has discovered five basic trajectories for frontal impacts which have been statistically classified in the following (216): These statistics were compiled from information covered in the Pedestrian Injury Causation Study (242). Different types of post-impact kinematics result from the interrelationships between vehicle front end design, pedestrian anthropo- morphic dimensions, vehicle speed, and vehicle/ pedestrian orientation. Knowledge of the post- impact kinematics of a pedestrian can provide some insight for the accident reconstruction. For example, if a pedestrian vaulted over a vehicle roof, it may be concluded that little or no braking was initiated prior to or during the contact sequence, as can be seen in Table 1. Research has developed several types of impact modeling to simulate pedestrian/vehicle collisions. These modeling techniques involve cadavers, anthropomorphic dummies, body segment modeling, and mathematical simulations. Staged pedestrian impacts with these modeling tech- niques can provide a qualitative and sometimes quantitative measure of injury by recon- structing real world accidents in the labora- tory. Results of this kind of testing can be found (53, 86, 115, 172, 218, 220, 298). These references relate a quantitative measure of injury known as the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) obtained from the accident to the dynamic parameters of a human surrogate. This informa- tion provides a foundation upon which to mitigate pedestrian injuries by modifying the vehicle impact characteristics to yield accept- able dynamic parameters below an established injury tolerance. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has taken steps toward injury mitigation with a proposal for a pedes- trian impact protection standard issued in January 1981. Further research in pedestrian impact reconstruction is being conducted in order to define a means of measuring injury tolerance.
