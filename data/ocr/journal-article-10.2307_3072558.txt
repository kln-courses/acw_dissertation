Ever since its formal beginnings as an academic field, international rela- tions has been a site of contestation. More often than not, this debate has taken the form of dualistic or tripartite encounters between different approaches. Whether as the time-honored clash between idealists and real- ists, the methodological spat between realists and behavioralists, or the text- book-friendly debate between realism, pluralism, and globalism, interna- tional relations has encouraged the impression that fundamental assumptions in the study of world politics are subject to doubt. Impressions can be misleading. While the various contestants in the para- digmatic beauty parade have sought to highlight their differences with, and comparative advantage over, their opponents, shared metatheoretical com- mitments to an empiricist and/or positivist metaphysic have substantially limited the range of theoretical possibilities. Likewise, shared disciplinary commitments to the development of a social science concerned principally AUTHOR'SNOTE: My thanks to Martin Coward, Marieke de Goede, and ErnaRijsdijkfor help- ful comments on this article.

The past two decades have, however, been somewhat different. Interna- tional relations has been confronted with theoretical insurgencies driven vari- ously by appreciations for the importance of postempiricist developments in the philosophy of science, the linguistic turn in Anglo-American philosophy, the contributions of continental thought (in both its German critical theory and French poststructuralist guise), and the radical questioning of feminist and postcolonial perspectives. While the changes witnessed in this time are, from one perspective, no more than a case of playing intellectual catch-up with currents of critical thought long present elsewhere, the basic metatheoretical and disciplinary commitments of international relations have finally been subject to sustained challenge. It is not surprising that this challenge has not always been welcomed by the mainstream of the field, their liberal inclinations notwithstanding. Even as many declare an openness to debate and speak of the contributions plural perspectives might make, there has often been a reinstatement of the assump- tions in question as the criteria for assessing both the content and even legiti- macy of new contributions. Such moves illustrate well that when it comes to reviewing theoretical developments in international relations, attention needs to be paid to the disciplinary politics of contending positions, the way in which arguments bear on the governing conventions of the field, and the way in which commitments open or close the possibilities for accepting as legitimate, let alone agreeing with, radically divergent arguments. In other words, the rules of engagement for intellectual contestation, either implicit or explicit in current work, can tell us as much about the field as the content of specific arguments. That is the theme I want to pursue in this review of new books by Alan Gilbert, Stephen Krasner, and Alexander Wendt. TRUTH, POWER, AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AFTER VIETNAM Alan Gilbert's Must Global Politics Constrain Democracy? signals its intent with a question for a title. Less a theory than a political cri- tique-although certainly no less a contribution for being that-Gilbert's book adopts a democratic internationalist perspective to press home the claim that realism (and especially neorealism) in North American interna- tional relations must concern itself with domestic harm. Driven by a desire to honor the anti-Vietnam protest movement in the United States-and noting his own personal involvement in this movement-Gilbert argues that the</page><page sequence="3">434 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 great power rivalry feted as an unfortunate but unavoidable necessity by most realists has devastating effects on democracy at home. The destructive feedback from international rivalry, so evident in the Viet- nam era, has for Gilbert diminished democracy in the United States to such an extent that America is no more than a capitalist oligarchy with parliamentary forms, in which political leaders cynically manipulate the invocation of external enemies to achieve their internal aims. Moreover, as chapter 5 angrily (but rightly) demonstrates, the polity is replete with economic and social perversions detrimental to the common good. These deficiencies are not restricted to the contemporary era, notes Gilbert. We only have to look at "the embarrassingly full pages of American political history" (p. 30) to see earlier incarnations of these tendencies. To overcome the dangers, Gilbert proposes what is in effect an interesting reworking of the democratic peace hypothesis. Democratic peace theory, or the notion that democratic states do not go to war with one another, has been the source of a major debate in international relations. (Limitations that problematize this argument-such as the fact that democracy means formal liberal democracy, that "war" is restricted to cross-border events resulting in one thousand or more battle deaths, and the fact that democracies regularly go to war with parties considered undemocratic-are excluded from this argument, a point noted by Gilbert.) Moving away from the focus of the nature of interstate rivalry, Gilbert maintains that a reconstitution of intrastate politics through transnational dimensions will have beneficial outcomes. As he argues, "Democratic internationalism is the thesis that the basic political and moral concerns of ordinary people conflict with imperial domination, and will, through political activity from below, sometimes check the normal inclination of the powerful and advantaged to war" (p. 27). The problem for Gilbert with the conventional debate on the democratic peace is that the inter- national system as currently constituted does not have many if any demo- cratic states. Were deliberative democracy to be installed through and with democratic internationalism, Gilbert maintains that the desire for war and intervention would be diminished. Substantively, this thesis is based on a key assumption that goes unques- tioned throughout his book. Why should we assume that the "basic" concerns of "ordinary" people are hostile to intervention, imperial domination, and war? Are not the pages of many societies' political history "embarrassingly full" with moments in which international violence has been popular? While there has undoubtedly been destructive feedback from international rivalry, does not some of that feedback help fuel elements of international rivalry through popular support for action against others? It might be comforting, if conceptually a bit old-fashioned, to believe that the masses are simply misled</page><page sequence="4">Campbell / REVIEW ESSAY 435 by self-aggrandizing and self-enriching elites, but the more disturbing thing is to try to appreciate the complex cultural dynamics implicated in violence toward international others that help make imperial adventures at least appear popular. President George Bush's exorbitantly high poll ratings in the wake of the Gulf War might have ebbed away once domestic economic issues returned to the fore, but that cannot disguise the considerable popular support his administration had for their lack of concern about the deaths of Iraqis dur- ing the Gulf War. Conceptually, Gilbert's argument involves a number of interesting moves. His concern with the domestic harm generated by international rivalry involves a series of questions that realism, as conventionally understood, can- not hear. The idea that the borderline between the domestic and the interna- tional should be overlooked, especially by "normative" questions revolving around conceptions of the common good, is to utter something well off the traditional aural register of realism. Moral concerns, especially those associ- ated with domestic politics, should in the conventional view confine them- selves to home, for they are said to have no place among the harsh realities of great power rivalry. Counter to that formulation of the issue, Gilbert's book offers the singular service of reminding us that realism has it own morality and may even, through a sense of the common good sublimated in the idea of the national interest, have a morality that intersects with some of Gilbert's own concerns (pp. 32, 68). Other significant conceptual moves include the rereading of significant realist texts, specifically the work of Thucydides in chapter 4 and Hans Morgenthau, Reinhold Niebuhr, and George Kennan in chapter 2. Indeed, the analysis of Morgenthau's position and writing during the Vietnam War offers up a singularly important observation. Morgenthau, best known to under- graduates and many others as the author of realism's six cardinal principles in his seminal text Politics among Nations,' led a politicized existence during the 1 960s during which his writings adopted positions that would even today be taken as too radical for the mainstream. Between 1954 and 1964, Morgenthau undertook three official tours of Vietnam for successive U.S. administrations, slowly becoming more critical of U.S. policy each time. After he enraged Johnson by ensuring his negative assessments were pre- sented to the president, Morgenthau was subjected to a sustained campaign in which the active opposition of the White House dovetailed with the timidity of his professional academic colleagues to ensure his dissent was discredited and silenced (pp. 67-68). This experience led Morgenthau to revise his understanding of the rela- tionship between truth and power. Whereas once he had naively believed that academics could-as in his reports on Vietnam policy-speak the truth to</page><page sequence="5">436 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 power, he now believed that an "academic-political complex" matched the "military-industrial complex" that had concerned Eisenhower (p. 84). In this social formation, which Gilbert amends to an "academic-political-media complex" (p. 99), the integrity of academia had been compromised by the profession's willingness "to become the handmaiden of government, while maintaining its pretense to independence." Universities, Morgenthau bitterly observed, were thus no more than "a gigantic and indispensable service sta- tion for the powers-that-be, both public and private" (p. 84). While it is there- fore illusory to believe "that truth can show power the way in direct confron- tation," Morgenthau was reassured that "truth can indeed make people 'see a lot of things in a new light.' And when people see things in a new light, they might act in a new way" (p. 71). Gilbert's argument is in many respects an attempt to see things in a new light in the hope that we can act in a new way. Given that, and given the force of many of the political criticisms in the book, the self-imposed parameters of Gilbert's argument appear as incongruous and problematic. On one hand, Gilbert sees himself challenging the artificial walls dividing international politics from domestic politics and breaking down the barriers between "empirical" political science and "normative" political theory (p. 8). Yet, Gilbert stresses on many occasions that what he is undertaking is an internal critique of realism. This means explicitly that he begins from the same core premise as realism, namely, great-power rivalry-with its faith in the auton- omy of the international and its contempt for the normative (p. 4). At the very least, this is an uncomfortable and not very productive tension. When the politicization of key issues is further constrained by Gilbert's methodological propensity for boiling things down into competing thesis after competing thesis, which are then endlessly revised and tabulated throughout the book, the idea that the argument of this book is "startling" (p. 10) might be better applied to the notion that critical aims can be achieved by sharing the depoliticizing theoretical assumptions of the discipline's mainstream. POWER AND INTEREST AFTER THE COLD WAR If Gilbert's book is in any way startling, the recent work of his onetime sparring partner, Stephen Krasner, might be equally regarded. Krasner's Sov- ereignty will, at least on the surface, surprise those who associate his name with an unshakable faith in the realist project. For here is the defender of the national interest and the believer in structural conflict focusing on issues such minority rights, human rights, and the complexities of constitutional change</page><page sequence="6">Campbell / REVIEW ESSAY 437 in new states to tell us that Westphalian sovereignty, one of the lynchpins of international relation's narrative of world politics, is not all it claims to be. Krasner's principal aim is to investigate what sovereign statehood has meant in actual practice. To this end, the argument follows two lines of inves- tigation. The first is to reduce the options into a series of possibilities struc- tured as typologies. As a result, sovereignty is disaggregated into four ideal types (pp. 3-4). Then, two logics of action are outlined-logics of conse- quences (involving rational maximization) and logics of appropriateness (dealing with rules and identities). Despite variations in influence, interna- tional politics is for Krasner dominated by the logic of consequences. As such, the priority of preferences over norms--combined with the way in which the domains of the domestic and the international are taken to be ana- lytically distinct and qualitatively different-means that Krasner reiterates well-known realist themes. Once the typologies of action and sovereignty are devised, and the politi- cal is segmented according to the assumptions of those typologies, the second line of investigation in Krasner's argument proceeds via selected historical narratives dealing with the practice of sovereign statehood in the domains of minority rights, human rights, international financial borrowing, and consti- tutional structures. These historical narratives aim to establish the suppos- edly empirical data and independent ground of international reality required to substantiate the opening assumptions (p. 28). Taken at face value and in their own terms, Krasner's narratives are quite revealing. In contrast to the ahistorical assumptions of much previous inter- national relations theory, these narratives demonstrate, as Krasner makes clear, that the codes and norms of the international system have been fre- quently transgressed and violated. The hermetic and homogenizing assump- tions of the Westphalian account of sovereignty are thus problematic. This might lead one to conclude that questions of contingency and the historical production of international norms could be usefully explored, but Krasner's conclusion is somewhat different. Having set up the argument in terms of some specific assumptions about the logic of international action, Krasner is clear that his historical accounts favor one side over the other. As he states, Outcomes in the international system are determined by rulers whose violation of, or adherence to, international principles or rules is based on calculations of material and ideational interests, not taken-for-granted practices derived from some overarching insti- tutional structures or deeply embedded generative grammars. Organized hypocrisy is the state of affairs. (p. 9)</page><page sequence="7">438 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 So rather than pursue questions of ambiguity, contingency, and the produc- tion of norms, Krasner sees variations in terms of instrumentally pursued interests, which leads him to characterize the situation as "hypocrisy," a term that is dependent on his prior assumptions about actors and their preferences. Rather than opting for even a mix of the competing logics, we are told that logics of consequence thereby always trump logics of appropriateness (pp. 72, 220). My purpose is not to suggest that Krasner got things wrong because he did not pursue other options but to demonstrate, rather, that he cannot be said to have got them right in terms of epistemological criteria-rationalist concerns with evidence, hypotheses, testing, and secure pronouncements of interna- tional reality-he wants to implicitly and explicitly promote. This is the case because of the status of the historical narratives in Krasner's argument. Summarized crudely, the production of a narrative involves an interpreta- tive process of emplotment, which means the story that results is not depend- ent on the veracity of the time-place specific events it incorporates and appears to rely on. This is not to suggest that narratives make everything up and that any narrative will do. It is to suggest, however, that the narrative can- not function as an independent realm of verification for prior political assumptions. This is clear in Krasner's argument because the narratives employed are necessarily particular and partial. Whatever narrative was composed would inevitably be selective, a point that nonetheless does not prevent us from questioning aspects of Krasner's narratives (for example, the weak under- standing of events in the former Yugoslavia, pp. 99-102). The more signifi- cant point is that Krasner's narratives are written in terms of the assumptions about rulers, power, and interest he wishes to demonstrate. Krasner's narra- tives are not going to reveal that the logics of appropriateness are dominant because what counts as significant in the story are actors, issues, and events rendered in terms of the logic of consequences. This means that although the historical narratives are written so that the particulars appear as data for a rationalist account, these "data" are made available because of the way the narrative structure is governed by the prior assumptions. The process of argu- mentation involves, therefore, an unacknowledged level of self- referentiality, something more significant than simply charging the author with "scavenging for examples that support the argument" (p. 28). This means that while Krasner's argument can generate many insightful and use- ful interpretations in its own terms, it cannot offer the proof of the proposi- tions he wishes to support in the terms he wishes to support them. If that is the case, is there a larger purpose to Krasner's argument? None is apparent concerning the issues identified in the process of making the argu-</page><page sequence="8">Campbell / REVIEW ESSAY 439 ment. Having detailed the prevalence of organized hypocrisy, Krasner's argu- ment does not extend itself to deal with whether this condition could or should be overcome or how the increasingly pressing questions of rights might be better promoted in the world as he sees it. However, Krasner's analytic of logics of consequences versus appropri- ateness offers him a way of mapping most of the major contenders in interna- tional relations theory and suggests that what is at stake here is a defense and revivification of materialist notions of power and interest as determinants of international politics. For Krasner, rationalist approaches like neorealism and neoliberalism operate in terms of the logic of consequences, while their constructivist counterparts (including the English school) concentrate on logics of appropriateness (p. 6). Indeed, this sense that the current debate in international relations is marked by the contrast between rationalism and constructivism is widely shared, even if the latter term refers to a broad church with many agonistic and not always compatible brethren. Krasner is careful to distinguish himself (ever so slightly) from some of the ontologi- cal commitments of neorealism and neoliberalism (p. 6), acknowledges the benefits of constructivism's focus on intersubjectivity, but nonetheless wants to draw a clear line beyond which legitimate international scholars should not proceed. Krasner is keen to hive off "conventional constructivists," with their ratio- nalist acceptance of social scientific methodologies aimed at disclosing objective reality, from their "postmodernist" counterparts, who apparently reject notions of objective reality (pp. 48-49). Krasner acknowledges that dif- ferent theoretical accounts of international relations embody larger and more general commitments about the nature of social life (p. 43). But his adherence to one of those general commitments-the division of the world into distinct realms of the ideational versus the material, which allow one to conceive in the first place of power/interests versus norms/rules-remains stubbornly unshaken by recent theoretical developments. As I shall argue, it is perhaps this commitment above others that produces the points of tension between rationalist and other perspectives. Above all, a refiguring of how we under- stand the ideal/material dichotomy can cast a different light on some rational- ist objections to "postmodernism." INTERNATIONAL THEORYAFTER WALTZ Kenneth Waltz's Theory of International Politics appeared in 1979 at an interesting intellectual and political juncture for the field. It was a response to critiques of realist thought, which had emphasized throughout the previous</page><page sequence="9">440 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 decade that a more nuanced understanding of power was required and that the forces of interdependence and transnationalism were complicating simple schemas of autonomous states pursuing externally generated interests. It was a response that, through its systemic approach and concern with material capabilities, breathed new life into some of the assumptions in question. Because Waltz's book restated many realist precepts with force and because it emerged as theorists such as Richard K. Ashley and R.B.J. Walker were variously deploying insights from social theory generally to probe interna- tional relations' foundations, it became a pivot around which many disciplin- ary debates were subsequently organized. Twenty years on, Alex Wendt's Social Theory of International Politics self-consciously mirrors aspects of Waltz's project, albeit to offer something of a constructivist corrective. Wendt's book is unusual in the current intellec- tual climate because in many respects, it is a bold attempt to write a grand the- ory of international politics at a time when more modest foci are favored. It is an ambitious work that derives its energy from an appreciation for critical interdisciplinary debates, although, despite its gestures toward Foucault, it overlooks most continental philosophy and restricts its engagements to Anglo-American analytical philosophy and sociology. Wendt seeks to offer a theory of the international system as a social con- struction and sees this as an effort in applied social theory. Wendt's concep- tual assumptions are overtly displayed at the outset: contrary to Krasner, ideational factors trump material forces when we are dealing with questions of human association like international structure; and an individualist focus should be rejected in place of holistic perspective. In a combination that will unsettle the traditional compass of international relations, Wendt proposes a "structural idealism" (p. 1). At first glance, nothing could appear further removed from the materialist commitments of realism. But for those who hold that constructivism per se merits being located among the contributions of critical theory, Wendt's sub- sequent moves are likely to prove disconcerting. Wendt does not hold back from adopting metatheoretical positions seriously questioned by critical per- spectives: he variously describes himself and his position (while being care- ful to note some distinctions to his understanding of these terms) as being positivist, scientific, and essentialist (pp. 39, 63, 90). Nor does he shy away from the conventional aspects of his international theory: it shares much with realism, particularly its state centrism and concern with national interests (p. 33). Like Gilbert, then, Wendt accepts many of the key assumptions of Neorealism in terms that would be familiar to Krasner and others. What, then, animates this transfonnation of constructivism's critical potentialities into a position-what Wendt calls variously a moderate, thin,</page><page sequence="10">Campbell / REVIEW ESSAY 441 weak, or modernist constructivism (pp. 1-2, 47)-that is at home in the realist mainstream? The answer lies in its systemic focus (pp. 10-14). Wendt is con- cerned not with international politics, not even with a broader sense of inter- national relations, but with the specific domain of the international system (by which he means the even more specific domain of the interstate system). As such, Wendt bifurcates politics into domestic and international domains and argues that the international system can be considered as relatively autonomous from these other domains (p. 14). In this sense, its title and disci- plinary ambitions notwithstanding, Wendt's book is less concerned with a general social theory of international politics than a very particular social the- ory of the international system conceived in a particular way. The systemic focus Wendt concerns himself with requires a number of conceptual assumptions that move his work squarely into mainstream areas. Most obvious is the assumption that if one is to theorize social construction at the level of the state system, a solid platform is said to be required. This leads Wendt to argue that states are presocial and ontologically prior to the interna- tional system (p. 198). Wendt's conception of state centrism as being equiva- lent to the idea of the human body as the presocial foundation for human rela- tions means that he has a state-centric theory that argues that states really are anthropomorphic, unitary actors, something that is more fixed than most for- mulations of realism that treat states as though they were actors of this kind (p. 10). This notion of states as self-organizing internal structures produces some dubious empirical observations in the book. For example, Wendt main- tains that "what makes, say, Germany 'Germany' is primarily the agency and discourse of those who call themselves Germans, not the agency and dis- course of outsiders" (p. 74). Given the international postwar reconstruction of Germany and its impact on creating a democratic German society (a set of developments that even Krasner [pp. 208-12] observes involved the trans- gression of inside/outside distinctions), the role played by the Holocaust in contestations over German national identity and the transnational context for the reunification of Germany in 1990, the surety of this claim seems mis- placed. Overall, what assumptions of this kind mean is that "social construc- tion" for Wendt is confined to a very specific and overly limited aspect of international relations-interactions between already existing actors in an already constituted system-and many of the most interesting cultural and political questions thus fall outside his purview. The question that is most puzzling, therefore, is why someone with such a breadth of knowledge of social theory and international relations would want to limit their argument to something as partial and contestable as this. I will venture two possible explanations for this. The first is that for all the interdis- ciplinary influences on this project, Wendt has a very discipline-specific pur-</page><page sequence="11">442 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 pose. As he notes on a couple of occasions, he sees his work as a means to chart a "via media" (p. 40)-a "philosophically principled middle way" (p. 2)- between contending and often hostile positions in international relations. This he does by mapping all international relations theory in such a way as to give constructivism a genealogy within prior disciplinary debates, thereby locating his work as part of a "revival" of themes long considered legitimate (pp. 3-4, 30-32). It involves, also, underscoring that legitimacy by demon- strating to the mainstream that it is wrong to regard any talk of social con- struction as an abdication to "postmodernism" (p. 2) so as to make more diffi- cult "the ease with which a moderate constructivism can be tarred with the brush of implausible radical positions" (p. 110). In these respects, Wendt has already been remarkably successful. In reviews of Social Theory, both Krasner and Robert Keohane have made a point of noting that, as Keohane declared, "he has shown convincingly that one does not have to swallow the contaminated epistemological water of postmodernism in order to enjoy the heady ontological wine of construc- tivism."2 Given that Wendt's engagements with his others are-because of his desire to be positioned as a bridge builder between antagonistic positions- a good deal more friendly and substantive than Krasner's and Keohane's have ever been, the use of his work to delegitimize his others may not be to his lik- ing. But his work certainly permits if not encourages this disciplinary deploy- ment. In this context, Steve Smith has observed that the familiarity of Wendt's world to the mainstream means "his book will come to define the limits of dealing with the ideational in the mainstream of International Rela- tions for the next decade."3 If that proves to be the case, the intellectual clo- sure that results will not be a good thing for international relations. The second, and more important, explanation I will venture is that the four sociologies of international politics Wendt identifies-especially the idea that the polarity of idealism and materialism describes the extent of our worldly possibilities-structure his argument in a very particular way. Indeed, one of the most striking things about Wendt's book is the way in which a commitment to naturalism emerges as the underpinning for many of his theoretical moves. Wendt has two aims that sit uncomfortably together. The first is the sub- stantive concern with the social nature of international structure and the ideational character of power and interests in the international system. The second is the conceptual desire to remain faithful to scientific realism and search for causal as well as constitutive explanations. The problem is that the second ends up overriding the first, which means that Wendt has to severely limit the extent of the ideational. Thus, we are informed that because pigs</page><page sequence="12">Campbell / REVIEW ESSAY 443 cannot fly, cats and dogs just are, atoms and water have natural properties impervious to discourse, and bullets will stop you in your tracks (p. 113; an example Krasner, p. 51, shares for the same purpose), we should be open to the possibility that states too have essential characteristics however we care to regard them. Indeed, this naturalism underpins the very idea of the state. Although states might be constructed vis-a-vis domestic politics, they are self-organizing entities vis-'a-vis the international system in the same way, allegedly, that the body is presocial and trees are the constitutive units of for- ests (p. 9). In chapter 3, building on this notion that actually it is not a case of ideas all the way down, Wendt defends notions of a rump materialism, in which-somewhat surprisingly-human nature, technology, and geography count as purely material phenomena. All this is designed to support the moderate, thin, or weak elements of Wendt's constructivism, which mean that the possibility of the constructed ends once the natural begins. As Wendt declares, "constructivism without nature goes too far" (p. 72). But where is the line between the constructed world and the natural world? For Wendt, such a question probably makes lit- tle sense for his project. After all, he declares that "in the end, there can only be two possibilities, materialist and idealist, because there are only two kinds of stuff in the world, material and ideational" (p. 137). But given the attention paid to the constructed character of the natural in, for example, anthropology, development studies, geography, and political theory, can such ringing decla- rations about reality be so confidently maintained?4 The evidence Wendt would want to prove the assertion that there are only two kinds of "stuff," the ideal and the material, in the world seems to be lacking. However, my aim here is not to show that Wendt is wrong and thus his pro- ject is irretrievably flawed because it lacks evidence all the way down. All arguments eventually lack secure evidence all the way down. We all make what William Connolly calls different "ontopolitical assumptions," interpre- tative judgments about the nature of reality and our capacities to understand them.' Highlighting the indispensability of interpretation helps illuminate why the surety of Wendt and others about the naturalism of the ideal/material dichotomy is problematic. There are other ways to conceive of these matters, and appreciating this might help Krasner and Wendt better understand how so-called postmodernists (I speak principally for myself here while continu- ing to resist this terminology) conceive them. My way of understanding what is entailed in the relationship of discourse (which is more than language and has substantive effects) to reality is indebted to Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe. As Laclau and Mouffe have argued,</page><page sequence="13">444 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 the fact that every object is constituted as an object of discourse has nothing to do with whether there is a world external to thought, or with the realism/idealism opposi- tion...What is denied is not that...objects exist externally to thought, but the rather differ- ent assertion that they could constitute themselves as objects outside of any discursive condition of emergence.6 To put it in an overly simple manner, while this means that nothing exists out- side of discourse, it still recognizes important distinctions between linguistic and nonlinguistic phenomena (as well as accepting that there are modes of symbolization that are ideational though strictly nonlinguistic, such as the aesthetic and pictorial). It is just that there is no way of bringing into being and comprehending nonlinguistic and extra-discursive phenomena except through discursive practices. As noted, both Krasner and Wendt are fond of the "bullet in the head" example as a support for their assumption about the naturalness of material- ism. In the context of international politics, given the understanding of dis- course I outline above, how might we respond to this point? First, we would say that the issue is not one of the materiality of the bullet or the reality of death for the individual when struck by the bullet in a particular way. The undeniable existence of that world external to thought is not the issue. Sec- ond, we would say that such a world-the body lying on the ground, the bul- let in the head, and the shell casing lying not far away-tells us nothing itself about the meaning and significance of those elements. We would say that the constitution of the event and its elements is a product of its discursive condi- tion of emergence, something that occurs via the contestation of competing narratives. For example, did the body and the bullet get to be as they are because of suicide, manslaughter, murder, ethnic cleansing, tribal war, geno- cide, a war of interstate rivalry, or ... ? Each of those terms signifies a larger discursive formation through which a whole set of identities, social relations, political possibilities, and ethical outcomes are made more or less possible. Whichever figuration emerges as the accepted or dominant one has little to do with the materiality of specific elements and much to do with power of partic- ular discourses materializing elements into comprehensible forms with polit- ical effects.7 Wendt is surely right to observe that the Balinese marching into Dutch machine guns and the Polish cavalry charging German tanks could hardly wish away imminent death by declaring that discourse should be historicized (p. 1 3). But focusing specifically on the bullets that riddled their bodies tells us very little about those circumstances beyond the fact that people died, something that occurs in many other dissimilar circumstances. Not least, it fails to tell us how the Balinese and the Polish, knowing full well the likely</page><page sequence="14">Campbell / REVIEW ESSAY 445 futility of their actions, nonetheless sacrificed themselves. That is an expla- nation (and here, "explanation" has more in common with interpretation than causal theorizing) that is going to require, among other things, that attention be paid to discourses of loyalty, pride, and the nation.8 Moreover, if in interna- tional relations, we are, as we should be, concerned with the deaths of people in the basements of Grozny, the hilltop above Racak, the valleys around Srebrenica, or the church in Nyarubuye, Rwanda, limiting ourselves to the immediate cause of their bodily demise is going to be very unproductive. As such, the desire of Krasner and Wendt to shore up their materialist founda- tions with the argument that "postmodernists" and "radical constructivists" can be confined to subjectivist backwaters is both theoretically dubious and politically restrictive. If different interpretative possibilities flow from different positions as a consequence of different ontopolitical assumptions-and because these assumptions cannot be secured by evidence, we are unable to say one is right and the other wrong-can we nonetheless choose among these interpretative possibilities and say one or other is better? Yes. I think two points in Wendt's book demonstrate one line of potentially productive thinking in response to this. The first is that Wendt makes clear that his argument is ethically moti- vated, in which ethics is understood as involving the relationship between self and other, and how the other is represented and treated (pp. 21-22). As he admits, not much is said in the book about this, but the conviction that "deter- mining how we ought to act [towards the other] depend[s] in part on answers to the explanatory questions of how certain representations of Self and Other get created" (p. 22) apparently drives the argument and is a sentiment I am in almost total agreement with. The second comes at the very end of the book, in which Wendt concludes by declaring that ultimate test for the utility of knowledge flows from the question of "what is IR 'for' ?" (p. 378). I also think this is the right question to ask. Wendt thinks that international relations should be "a science (broadly defined) for purposive control over the constitutional evolution of the world system."9 Insofar as I have articulated a general position, it has been in terms of a philosophical anthropology of everyday life on a global scale. This might be said to emerge from specific, local inquiries of political questions, inqui- ries that focus on how problems in international politics are problematized.10 Others will no doubt have their own formulations, and their legitimacy should not be doubted even as we all contest the elements of contending argu- ments. What is important is appreciating that differences within the field stem in large part from different starting assumptions about the purpose of knowl-</page><page sequence="15">446 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 edge. Framing the initial concern differently means we make different ontopolitical assumptions, which in turn means we adhere to different proto- cols of inquiry. If we were to address the same empirical political questions, we would as a result no doubt do so very differently. That means that if we take international relations to be broad enough to accommodate these dispa- rate aims and logics-and why shouldn't we?-then we face a dilemma about how engagements between different positions can be pursued. If we effectively view the world differently because we have a different sense of purpose, how can we engage and make judgments about the merits or other- wise of contending perspectives? Obviously, recognition of what is at stake in these engagements is key. Appreciating the range of purposive assumptions about inquiry is essential. But that appreciation shifts the most important criteria from methodological, epistemological, ontological or whichever grounds-even as we will no doubt draw attention to the various assumptions and logical problems of our competing views in these terms-to ethico-political criteria. Of the three books reviewed here, Gilbert's argument addresses such criteria most directly, while Krasner's work eschews it altogether. Wendt's book intro- duces the topic but then does not pursue it. In his subsequent paper, Wendt outlines how he might address the issues, but its mildly reformist inclinations notwithstanding, Wendt's understanding of what international relations is for strikes me as too open to the embrace of the academic-political complex that Morgenthau railed against. But these thoughts can only be pursued more thoroughly once we understand the importance of the debate in these terms. We are, of course, on a highly contested and contingent terrain when the debate moves to ethico-political criteria. But it is not a terrain limited by per- sonal choice or subjective preferences. It is a terrain mapped out by the issue, as Wendt's ethical motivation realized, of how we figure and deal with our responsibility to the other. Moreover, it is not a terrain in which ethico-politi- cal criteria are imposed from outside the field in place of, or over and above, other commitments as essential to the debate in international relations. The terrain of international relations is already marked by these ethico-political criteria through its reliance on inside/outside distinctions, which are the geo- graphical-spatial exemplars of self/other demarcations. Although so marked, the consequences of this are rarely recognized. As such, the international engagements that contest the fundamental assumptions of international rela- tions have, appearances to the contrary, barely begun. -David Campbell University of Newcastle</page><page sequence="16">Campbell / REVIEW ESSAY 447 NOTES 1.

Some of the work in social anthropology offers a radically different argument to positions like Wendt's-especially on questions such as technology-without conceding that a question- ing of the natural means an abandonment of the material.

This will require developing arguments based on evidence. In that sense, Wendt is par- tially right to argue that there is something like a "tacit realism" in "postmodemist/radical constructivist" arguments (p. 67). However, Wendt assumes that a tacit realism must be proof of adherence to a particular set of metatheoretical commitments associated with a wholly externalized reality, hypothesis construction, and theory testing. In contrast, "amassing data" and "developing the best narrative" (his term, rightly showing how theory construction is not the issue) need to be seen as part of exploring the discursive conditions of emergence of the events and issues under investigation and the effects of the discursive formation that materializes. In no way does using empirical evidence mean one is beholden to empiricism or positivism. In fram- ing the possibilities for argumentation only in terms of social scientific protocols, Wendt sounds suspiciously like Keohane and others when they demand that all work confonn to particular research traditions.
