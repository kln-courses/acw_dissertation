Moore Harvard School of Public Health THE PURPOSE of this paper is to review some of the applica- tions of ergonomics and human factors research to highway safety, with special reference to the design of vehicles and con- trol of the environment. In broad terms, the field of ergo- nomics, as it is called in Great Britain and Europe, and human engineering or biotechnology in the United States, is con- cerned with the relation between man and his occupation, equipment and environment, and particularly the application of anatomical, physiological, and psychological knowledge to the problems arriving therefrom. A primary objective of this approach is to improve the ef- ficiency and safety of man-machine systems through the more effective integration of men and their equipment. That is, fewer errors, and accidents, might be expected if information on the biological and psychological capabilities and the limita- tions of the human operators are considered in the original design of the equipment intended for their use. Ergonomics and human engineering developed largely as a result of the experience in the use of equipment in World War II. The potentialities of numerous complex, precisely engineered devices could not be realized because the human operators often lacked the necessary capabilities required to operate them. In the United States, the new discipline devel- oped initially within the aircraft industry, and still is largely centered there. However, it now has been extended to many other manufacturing areas for the more effective integration of men and machines. This field of research refers not only to the application of psychological and physiological data in the design of specialized instruments and controls in the layout of working areas in the design of complex systems, but also in the design of products for general use in homes and factories. Among industrial organizations in the United States, only one company had established a formal human engineering program prior to 1950. In 1956, this number had grown to 24, and, by 1968, 178 companies had such programs, with an average of about 20 persons per human factors group. A large number of human factors personnel are also employed in university and nonprofit research centers, and in govern- ment agencies. The total number of persons now working ABSTRACT The use of ergonomics in the design of vehicular equipment is presented. It is proposed that the wider use of the principles and methods of this discipline might aid in the more effective integration of the driver and his equipment. It has been shown that the effectiveness of any man-machine system depends upon the integration of the biological characteristics of the operator with the mechanical design of the equipment and working areas. The initial phase of a program in ergonomics should always consist of an advance analysis of the equipment, including a survey of the nature of the task, the work sur- roundings, the location of controls and instruments, and the way the operator performs his duties. In highway safety the application of human engineering principles has been shown to be of great importance in the design of windshields, rear view mirrors, and vehicle lighting, and other visual aids to the drivers. The field of crash injury research is proving to be especially important in understanding the parts of the vehicle most likely to give rise to injury. Cur- rent research is tending to give more precise measurements not only in regard to the forces involved, but also to the thresholds and patterns of injury. The various research programs in the field of ergonomics as related to highway safety in various parts of the world have greatly increased in recent years. 1107</page><page sequence="2">1108 R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE professionally in the field of human factors and biotechnology in the United States is estimated as about 4400 (1)*. Virtually all of the manufacturers of airframes, missiles, helicopters and aircraft and space craft components either have human factors programs within the company, or utilize the services of specialists in this field. Until recently, less effort has been devoted within the automotive industry to human engineering design. However, most of the major automotive companies have now developed active human engineering programs, and are reporting their research findings in open publications. A compilation of the major research centers in the United States and abroad conducting human factors studies relating to the safe design of vehicular equipment is given in the final section of this paper. The professional organization of human engineering in the United States, the Human Factors Society, now includes a membership of approximately 1,700, representing 690 organi- zations in 46 states and 1 8 countries. Psychologists and engi- neers make up about 75% of the membership, and such areas as industrial design, physiology, medicine, physics, sociology, biology, mathematics, and anthropology are represented among the remaining members (2). The Society has its own journal, Human Factors, which is published bimonthly, for the technical and scientific reports in this field. There is also a monthly Bulletin, the newsletter of the organization. In Great Britain, the comparable professional organization is The Ergonomics Research Society. Its journal, Ergonomics, carries the technical papers not only from British workers in this field, but also includes reports from many American and European sources. Other journals, more recently introduced to carry reports of research in this field, include: 1 . The Journal of Engineering Psychology, Elias Publica- tions, Baltimore, Md. 2. Ergonomics Abstracts, Taylor and Francis, Ltd., London. 3. International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, Academic Press, New York. 4. Journal of Biomechanics, Pergamon Press, New York. 5. Applied Ergonomics, Iliffe Science and Technology Publications, Ltd., London. In 1959, an International Erogonomics Association (IE A) was proposed to foster international cooperation and hold meetings of an international character. Four such meetings have now been held, and the latest was held in July 1970 at Strasbourg. Although the IEA was initially formed as an as- sociation of individuals, it now includes other national organi- zations, in addition to the Ergonomics Research Society and the Human Factors Society. Among these are the Gesellshaft für Arbeitswissenschaft e. V., Nederlands Vereniging voor Ergonomie, Societa Italianne di Ergonomia, Society d' Ergo- nomics de Langue Française, and the Japan Ergonomics Re- search Society. Other organized national groups include the Ergonomics Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Hu- man Factors Association of Canada, The Nordics Ergonomics Society, and the Central Labour Institute in Bombay, India. ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. In addition, the International Labour Office, the World Health Organization, and the O.E.C.D. have had active working groups in the field of ergonomics. During the past few years there have been significant ad- vances, both in regard to basic concepts, and in the develop- ment of the biological and psychological information neces- sary for the guidance of the designers of equipment, both at the level of product design and at the level of complex sys- tems. The basic principles and methods of ergonomics and human engineering for application in a wide variety of prob- lems involving the integration of men and equipment may be found in Refs. 3-9. Also, much of the existing human engi- neering data have been made available in a handbook entitled, "Human Engineering Guide to Equipment Design," which was compiled under the auspices of a joint committee representing the U. S. Armed Services (10). Extensive data relating to human body size and biomechanics, previously limited in ap- plicability to the automotive field because they referred to selected, usually male, populations, now are available which include measurements from representative samples of the general United States population, male and female (11). Especially relevant to automotive design is a "pocketbook" of data and principles prepared at the Cornell Aeronautical Lab. (12) and an "Ergonomics Check List" from the Volvo Co. (13). APPLICATION OF ERGONOMICS FOR SAFE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES Human factors programs have contributed substantially to aviation safety and survival in aircraft accidents. There is lit- tle doubt that further application of human factors knowledge to problems of highway safety would also appreciably reduce highway accidents and the injuries and deaths resulting from these accidents. A few examples may be given to illustrate the point of view of ergonomics and human factors engineering, and to bring out the potentiality of this approach for increasing the safety factor. If an auditory warning signal is used to indicate the malfunction of equipment, would it not be best to select a frequency band to which the ear is most sensitive and which lies below the frequencies which older people hear poorly? If muscular "feedback," as well as vision, is important in controlling the directional stability of a vehicle, should not the resistances in a power-steering system be related to infor- mation about human "muscle sense"? If two control knobs are located close together on a dash- board, might not designing them so that they can readily be differentiated by touch help prevent inadvertent operation of the wrong control? Does the driver have a seat so designed as to ensure maxi- mum comfort and efficiency and to eliminate back strain and fatigue? The questions of importance in the analysis of design of vehicular equipment will include most of the following: 1 . What sense organs are used by the operator to receive</page><page sequence="3">ERGONOMICS AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY 1 109 information? Does he move into action at the sound of a buzzer, blink of a light, or reading of a dial? 2. What sort of discrimination is called for? Does the operator have to distinguish between lights of two different colors, tones of two different pitches, or compare two dial readings? 3. What physical response is he required to make? Pull a lever? Turn a wheel? Step on a pedal? Push a button? 4. What overall physical movements are required in the physical response? Do such movements interfere with his ability to continue receiving information through his sense organs? What forces are required (for example, torque in turning a wheel, foot pressure required for maximum braking)? 5 . What physiological and environmental conditions are likely to be encountered during normal operation of the vehi- cle? Are there any unusual temperatures, humidity conditions, poor ventilation, unavoidable fumes, and so on? Will the operator come to work from, presumably, a normal good night's rest and work in well-ventilated, well-lighted, cheerful conditions? Or will he be working under various stresses im- posed by aspects of the operation and its environment (3, 5, 10)? From the standpoint of human engineering, it is essential that the mechanical design of automotive equipment be com- patible with the biological and psychological characteristics of the driver. The effectiveness of the automotive man- machine combination can be greatly enhanced by treating the operator and the automobile as a unified system. Thus, the instruments should be considered as extensions of the driver's nervous and perceptive systems, the controls as extensions of the hands and the feet as simple tools. In general, any control difficult to reach or operate, any instrument dial of poor legibility, any seat inducing poor posture or discomfort, or any unnecessary obstruction to vision may contribute directly to an accident (14, 15). When the vehicle driver is viewed as one component of a man-machine system, the general human characteristics perti- nent to design are (4, 16): 1 . Physical dimensions. 2. Capability for data sensing. 3. Capability for data processing. 4. Capability for motor activity. 5. Capability for learning. 6. Physical and psychological needs. 7. Sensitivities to the physical environment. 8. Sensitivities to the social environment. 9. Capability for coordinated action. 10. Differences among individuals. Quantitative information about these human characteristics must be coordinated with the data on vehicle characteristics if maximum man-machine integration is to be achieved. Unfortunately, much of the biological and psychological information needed for this purpose is not yet available in reference to the general driving population, although pertinent human factors research is currently being carried out by many organizations. One of the most significant developments con- sists of the technological advances that have been made in electronics, especially in regard to high-speed monitoring, recording, and computing procedures, which make possible the effective and quantitative study of the human component in relation to the other components of the system and to the output of the total system. The application of digital and analog computers in simulating the performance of aircraft and submarines is one example of the progress made in this area. Attempts to apply these techniques for the study of the driver-vehicle-roadway system are currently being emphasized. In any such approach the driver would be considered a unique servomechanism in the man-machine system that alters the performance output of the system in accordance with the continuous sensory and perceptual input derived from the vehicle's responses, the environment, and the driver's judg- ments. The functioning of the nonhuman components of the system can be expressed in precise mathematical terms, but is difficult to include the human operator in these formulations. Except for a small number of activities, the human operator behaves in a nonlinear fashion, that is, his output does not necessarily equal the sum of his inputs. The important point for this discussion, however, is that with the new electronic techniques the performance of the vehicle and the environ- mental factors relevant to driving can be simulated and opera- tor performance can be closely monitored and objectively measured. These procedures may provide the basis for a precise quantitative study of the human problems in highway transportation (14). The specific features of vehicle design that deserve the attention of the human engineer are: 1. The layout of the work space, including spatial accom- modation and seating. 2. The design and arrangement of controls. 3. The design and arrangement of displays, including interior instruments and exterior displays for roadway information to other road users. 4. The design of window areas for maximum vision from the vehicle. 5. The design of the vehicle to provide maximum occupant protection during an accident. 6. The control of those aspects of the physical environment which influence the driver. 7. The prediction of error and the provision of margins of safety. Within the scope of the paper it would be impossible to pre- sent a comprehensive review of all the human factors research which has been carried out relative to the design areas listed. Rather, an attempt will be made to highlight some of the developments, and to indicate the present state of knowledge and the areas of research needed to derive necessary informa- tion. This review emphasizes the American studies and does not include many important contributions from other coun- tries. HUMAN BODY SIZE AND CAPABILITIES IN RELATION TO VEHICULAR DESIGN An important aspect of the design of vehicular equipment relates to the layout of the driver's work space and its con-</page><page sequence="4">Ilio R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE tents, in relation to the ranges of body size and dimensions, and the variation in physical abilities of the driver population. The role of anthropometry in the design of vehicles has been covered elsewhere. However, some of the ergonomie consider- ations in the present paper are so intimately connected with factors related to body size and capabilities that a brief re- view of some of the relevant principles seems pertinent. To design properly for the range of human body size and capabilities, it is necessary to determine: first, the nature of the task to be performed; second, the kinds of equipment used; third, the population who will use that equipment; fourth, the biological characteristics of that population. The task and the equipment used can generally be described rather easily, and the population using the equipment is almost always known, though their biological characteristics can often be determined only from a specially planned survey. The kinds of data needed are: 1. The range of human body size, with reference to the specific measurements used to establish the dimensions of the equipment. For example, three basic body measurements are needed to establish the dimensions of a seat to ensure maxi- mum comfort. They are: popliteal height, or floor-to-thigh height (for seat height), buttock-back-of-knee length (for seat length), and buttock breadth (for seat breadth) (17). Again, the functional arm reach (not simply anatomic arm length) of the smallest members of the group must be known before the outer limits of the work space for the location of con- trols can be determined. The data on sitting height are used to determine the seat-to-roof distance needed to accommodate various percentages of the population; sitting eye heights are important in determining the eye positions of driver in the vehicle. The data on elbow breadth, the maximum body breadth, are used to determine the minimum lateral dimen- sions necessary to accommodate the human body. Appro- priate clothing allowances should be added. 2. The range of motion of the various parts of the body. How far can a control knob be turned before regripping is required? How does wrist rotation and fìnger manipulation vary as the hand is moved to the different parts of the work space at which control adjustment might be necessary (18)? 3. The limits of strength that can be exerted in the opera- tion of various controls. It is especially important to obtain these data on the weakest members of the group. The infor- mation desired might include the maximum forces exertable in turning a wheel, in pressing a pedal, or in pulling a lever, both in single applications and over periods of continuous operation. 4. The speed of body movement. How do people vary in reaction time? How much time will elapse before the slowest members of a group perceive a signal, perhaps a warning signal, and start to take appropriate action? Once this action is started, how quickly can a control be moved? How rapidly can a dial be turned? For how long can this be done, and at what speeds, before fatigue sets in? 5. Accuracy of movement. What is the maximum amount of precision that can be expected from the least capable driver in the group? What accuracy can be expected in a tracking task, such as steering, for example? It will be noted that most of these human abilities and characteristics are closely interrelated. That is, speed of movement varies with the degree of accuracy required, and the amount of strength that can be exerted on a control de- pends to a great extent on the location of that control within the range of body movement. Hence, each human capability must be defined and described as but one element in the integrated pattern of physical activity that is characteristic of a specific task. It will also be noted that special reference has been made to those persons at the ends of the range of abilities or character- istics under consideration, for example, the weakest, the slowest, the largest. This use of extreme values is of consider- able importance in equipment design. For example, in estab- lishing clearances around the body to ensure "fit" and mini- mal interference with body movement, the designer is not concerned with the smaller persons in a group, but only with the largest ones. When establishing maximum allowable resis- tances in a control, one needs to know only the maximum strengths that can be applied by the weakest persons using that control. Similarly, any control speeds that can be attained by the slowest persons can also be attained by the fastest persons. Consequently, in order to be applied most effectively in equipment design, the relevant biomechanical and anthropo- metric data need to be presented in terms of distributions describing the range of abilities or characteristics of the popu- lation, not just in terms of an average. The use of average values in equipment design has led to considerable difficulties in the past. To give an example, a control just reachable by the man with an "average" arm reach would be out of reach to all those smaller than average. A dimension affording head clearance just adequate for a man of average height would not provide clearance for the 50% of the population taller than average. Such problems can be eliminated if the biological data are presented in percentiles, a statistical measure that expresses the numerical values of a given dimension or ability for se- lected percentages of the population. Often the data are given at 5% intervals from the 5th to the 95th percentiles, and at 1% intervals between the 1st and 5th, and 95th and 99th per- centiles. The latter percentiles frequently represent the part of the range of human capabilities that are most critical in equipment design. By using these percentile tables a given piece of equipment, or a task, can be evaluated in terms of the relevant human variables to determine what percentages of the population can be accommodated with regard to desired limits of efficiency and safety. More important, criteria for new design can be established in advance to accommodate any specified percentage of the population. Previously, many of the kinds of data herein described have been available only on specialized civilian groups, for example, on male military aviation personnel and civilian truck drivers (18). Data on the general population, to include both males and females, have largely been lacking for the designers, whose problems ideally are to design to accommodate the</page><page sequence="5">ERGONOMICS AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY 1111 range between the 5th percentile woman and the 95th per- centile man. Steps to overcome some of these deficiencies have recently been made. Each year the National Health Survey of the U.S. Public Health Service is conducted on a statistically representative sample of the American population. Between 1960 and 1962 the survey included the taking of 12 selected anthropometric measures of the sample population, including ten relevant to vehicle design. These data have now been published (19). A study has also been completed at Harvard, for the National Highway Safety Bureau, which includes: 1. 22 static anthropometric measurements related to the normal driving position on 1033 subjects, male and female. 2. A similar series of measurements taken on 203 pregnant women. 3. Measurements of functional arm reaches on 100 drivers, male and female (restrained by lap and shoulder belts) to 1 17 different points within the driver's work space. 4. An analysis of the relationships between stature and functional anthropometric data and of methods of predicting the latter from the former. It may be noted in a recent human factors evaluation of 1969 model automobiles it was estimated that the range of drivers which will "fit" into these American cars is from the 15th to the 80th percentile (20). It has also been brought out that existing knowledge of human body measurements as they apply to automotive design is widely divergent, and there is a lack of dynamic data. For example, not only are there differences between samples, but few of the data relate to the dynamic situation in the typical driving seated position in a car (21). HUMAN FACTORS IN DESIGN AND LOCATION OF CONTROLS In the operation of his vehicle the driver must decide upon the proper course of action and manipulate the appropriate controls with hands or feet in such a way as to produce any desired change in the vehicle's performance. The efficiency and effectiveness with which controls can be operated depends upon the extent to which information on the dynamics of human movement, or biomechanics, has been incorporated in their design. This is particularly true whenever controls must be operated at high rates of speed, against large resistance, with great precision, or over long periods of time (22, 23). Controls should be designed so that rapid, accurate settings can be easily made without undue fatigue. If so, many acci- dents and operational errors would be avoided. This thesis is strikingly illustrated by the landing gear and landing flap controls of many modern aircraft. These two controls, having very different functions, are sometimes placed very close together, and sometimes have their locations reversed on dif- ferent aircraft. In one instance a co-pilot, recently transferred from one type of plane to another, was requested to raise the flaps after land- ing and, since the flap and landing gear switches were exactly reversed on these two planes, inadvertently activated the wrong control. The safety mechanism was defective, the landing gear retracted, and the plane broke in half on the field. In the United States Air Force the inattentive manipulation or mistaken identity of those same two controls resulted in 547 recorded accidents during one 22-month period of World War 11(24). Some general principles of human engineering that may be applied to the design of vehicular controls to eliminate error, accident, and inefficiency, are as follows: 1 . Always use as few controls and as few control move- ments as possible- consistent with maximum efficiency. 2. Determine the best kind of control for a specific task, that is, foot or hand control, lever or wheel, push button or toggle switch. 3. Place controls within the normal, comfortable, reach area of the driver. 4. The direction of control movement should always be in the expected direction, that is, up or clockwise for on, right for movement to the right, etc. 5. The direction of movement should be consistent with the other characteristics of the control, that is, some directions are superior to others when maximum force must be exerted, other directions would be preferable when speed is of primary importance. 6. The extent of control movement should never exceed the range of movement of operator. 7. The amount of resistance to control movement should never exceed the abilities of the weakest operator, but there should be enough resistance to discourage inadvertent opera- tion. 8. The degree of precision with which a control can be operated should never exceed the operator's abilities, nor should the control be capable of finer adjustments than are necessary. 9. The size, shape, and orientation of the control should be compatible with maximum operational efficiency, that is, ease of grasp and movement. 10. Where necessary, controls should be differentiated, as by shape, size, or color, to prevent mistaken or inadvertent operation. 1 1 . Where compromises on any of the above principles become necessary, they should be made on a priority basis with the most critical and the most frequently used controls given first consideration (23). Automotive controls are operated exclusively by hands or feet, from the seated position. Their location and design thus requires information on the ranges of functional arm reach, leg reach, and the range of forces exertable by the extremities in different positions and directions. The information available, while extensive in regard to military and certain selected civilian groups, has, in general, not been representative of the driving public, and data for women have been especially lack- ing. In regard to functional arm reach, a recent project at Harvard has studied the functional arm reaches attainable by</page><page sequence="6">n 12 R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE persons seated in the normal driving position, while restrained by lap and shoulder belts. The 100 subjects, male and female, were selected to include subjects at the extremes of the body size distributions, as well as those more intermediate. Using a photographic technique, measurements were made of the reaches attainable with each hand in different vertical planes and directions from the body (25). Within the automotive industry, a parallel approach has also been developed to ensure functional arm reach and to derive "arm reach ergospheres" corresponding to various percentile levels in the size distribu- tion (26). Corresponding data relating to leg length in the context of automotive seating remain largely to be determined, although some data from conventional anthropometry are, in part, relevant (27). While pedal pressures required for braking have been gener- ally decreased in recent years through improvements in design, it seems important to establish maximum forces that can be applied by the weakest drivers as one criterion for brake sys- tem design. A study at Harvard, carried out for the NHSB, investigated the maximum forces which could be applied to three controls- a brake pedal, a steering wheel, and a simulated hand brake. Only women subjects were used, since, in general, they are known to be physically weaker than men. The age range of the subjects approximated that of women drivers in the United States. It was concluded that, for a brake pedal, maximum forces to be expected from the weakest drivers should not exceed 80-90 lb for a 10-sec effort. A 100-lb value would still be acceptable to by far the majority of driv- ers. For a steering wheel of 18 in. diameter, with both hands, maximum torques should not exceed 150 lb, to accommodate the weakest drivers. For pull-type hand brakes, force require- ments of about 20 lb should not be exceeded (28). The positions of the brake and accelerator pedals relative to each other have important implications for safety, in terms of the "transfer" time needed to move the foot from the acceler- ator to the brake. One study has been carried out comparing this time when accelerator and brake pedal were in the same horizontal plane and when there was a 6-in. height differ- ential between the pedals. The results indicated a reduction in stopping distance upwards of 14 ft at high speeds with the pedals in the same plane (29). The feasibility of combining acceleration and braking functions in a single pedal has also been explored (30), and experiments have been carried out on response time for left foot braking (31, 32), and the influence of pedal design on response time (33). In relation to control knobs on dashboards, a recent series of studies has been reported on the optimum diameter of knobs to be operated by fingertips, and the optimum spacing be- tween such knobs to prevent interference (34, 35). An interesting problem, the practical importance of which remains to be determined, has recently been raised on the effect of handedness on some directional stereotypes in con- trol-display relationships. This study suggests that control- display arrangements that are best for right-handed operators are not necessarily best for left-handed operators (36). Fur- ther research is needed to define the display-control relation- ship least influenced by the handedness factor, and to assess the importance of this problem in the field of automotive design. Some of the limited design information available on other vehicle controls concerns the accelerator and its angulation. The accelerator in the off position is generally located so that the angle at the ankle of the driver (foot with lower leg) is about 90 deg. One manufacturer considers a fixed ankle angle of 87 deg to be the "optimum comfort angle" (37). One medical authority states, however, that this is not the best "physiological resting position of the foot with the leg ex- tended" (38). He believes that a better angle would be 1 10 or 115 deg. Many persons now drive with the heel 3-4 in. in back of the pedal in order to achieve a larger and more comfortable angle of the ankle. This, of course, decreases the pedal lever- age, and may add to fatigue in protracted driving. Considerable engineering research has been concerned with the steering and handling qualities of vehicles, and, from the vehicle standpoint, this area is highly developed. To include the human operator in these formulations is more of a prob- lem. The steering and handling characteristics of motor vehi- cles can also be considered from the subjective aspects, or the ease and precision with which speed and direction can be maintained or altered at the will of the operator (39). A few studies have been carried out relating to these human factors or "subjective" aspects of vehicle handling. One study was concerned with the subjective effects on five drivers of changes in steering wheel forces during steady turns and fast passing maneuvers, and it was concluded that "... limited test data indicate that a steering-force gradient in the vicinity of 17 foot-lb ./g is considered near optimum when no control is exercised over the effective steering system damp- ing." Too light a force gradient, however, slows down the responses of the car-driver combination, thus causing under- shooting on turn entry (40). The effect of changes in some vehicle handling variables, that is, vehicle response time, steering ratio, etc., on a tracking task in a vehicle has been investigated in a study in Australia (41). The same investigators have also reported an experiment on the ability of drivers to detect the effect of changes in the handling characteristics. The subjects showed a high sensi- tivity to vehicle response time, and "reasonably good" ability to detect changes in steering ratio and stability factors. Great variability among subjects, however, was noted (42). HUMAN FACTORS AND DESIGN OF INSTRUMENTS A driver can successfully control his vehicle only to the ex- tent that he receives unambiguous information on all perti- nent aspects of his task. Sometimes operational errors or accidents occur because a driver misinterpreted, or was unable to obtain, information from his displays concerning the func- tioning of the equipment. The three basic types of indicators supplying the driver with information are (43): 1. The check display, which indicates whether or not a given condition exists- a red light to show failure, danger, or faulty operation.</page><page sequence="7">ERGONOMICS AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY 1113 2. The quantitative display, which indicates an exact numer- ical value to be read- a speedometer, or clock, 3. The qualitative display, which indicates whether, and in what direction, an operation has deviated from a desired level, without presenting precise quantitative data- an am- meter. Many quantitative displays could profitably be changed to the qualitative type of indicator. Whenever possible, instruments should have the least complex type of display consistent with the degree of precision required (Fig. 1). For best possible efficiency, all instruments should possess the following characteristics (44): 1 . Can be read quickly. 2. Can be read as accurately as is required- and preferably no more accurately. 3. Presents no ambiguity or likelihood of gross reading errors. 4. The information is provided in the most immediately useful form and does not require mental translation into other units. 5. Changes in value are easily detected. 6. Can be easily identified and distinquished from other in- struments. 7. The information is as current as possible. 8. If inoperative, either cannot be read or the operator is properly warned. The specific factors that influence the ease, speed, and accu- racy with which instruments can be read include location with reference to the operator, the size, shape, and spacing of the critical detail, and the brightness and contrast of the display. Design specifications for most of these factors have been determined experimentally, and are available for use by the automotive engineer and designer (43, 45-48). In the context of automobile design, the relation of the instrument display to safety relates to the extent that the driver can obtain the de- sired information with his eyes off the road for the shortest period of time. Thus each display item should be designed and located so that it can be read to the needed degree of ac- curacy as quickly as possible. Given the development of more adequate data on the range of the eye positions in the vehicle of the driver population, and in the functional arm and leg reaches when restrained by lap and shoulder belts, the problem remains for research to determine the optimal location of instruments within the driv- er's view, and of the optimal location of various controls. Lit- tle is known, for example, of the use drivers make of their instruments or of the frequency with which they are con- 400 f i^joo 500^' J* oo «ooA [m ' F I L III SAFE J &gt;ò°° 0y xy/ CQLCy^/ Fig. 1 - Simplification of dial markings. Displays should never provide more detailed information than is necessary (45) suited, as an aid for determining priorities in the display. A similar problem for research relates to the degree of standardi- zation in the location and design of hand-operated controls relative to safe and efficient operation (20). With the prolif- eration of instruments and controls in modern automobiles, the problem of accurate and rapid identification of their specific function arises. An appropriate area for further human factors research thus relates to the selection of words or symbols to identify specific functions of instruments and controls, which will be quickly understood by the driving public (20, 49). VISUAL CONSIDERATIONS AND VISIBILITY One of the most important functions of vehicle design, inso- far as the prevention of accidents is concerned, is to provide the driver with an optimum view of conditions outside the vehicle. Unless the driver can obtain at all times information concerning the environment in which the vehicle is operating he cannot be expected to make the decisions on vehicle con- trol that can ensure maximum operational safety.* What the driver can or cannot see from his vehicle is deter- mined by many factors, of which the most important are: the location of the driver's eye point; the size and shape of the windshield, side, and rear windows; obstructions to forward or rearward vision caused by the vehicle body, including side posts, hood, and roof, and the transmission characteristics of the glass. The design of windshields, side windows, and rear vision mirrors, is an important area for human engineering research. DESIGN OF WINDSHIELDS - Ideally, the driver should have as wide a field of view through the windshield and side windows with as few obstructions to vision as possible. Early human factors work in this area related to the development of techniques for measuring the field of view possible from the eye position of the driver, including the influence of vehicle structure such as the size and shape of the windshield and windows, and structural features as corner posts and forward sheet metal (52). Later work involved methods introducing anthropometric data on driver eye-height and a three-dimen- sional representation of the range of the position of drivers' eyes in relation to windshield and window design (53). More recently, the usefulness of the "eyellipse" data has been ex- tended to include the effect of turning the head from the for- ward position. One finding was that drivers tend not to turn their heads to see objects less than 30 deg from directly for- ward (54). In recent years considerable research has been devoted to analysis of the visual component in driving in terms of the driver's eye-movements and search patterns, and the visual cues involved in such driver behavior as car following, car pass- ing, and expressway merging (for example, Refs. 55-57). One promising technique resulting from these experiments has *An extensive review of data on human visual capacities in relation to the task of driving is presented in papers by Schmidt (50) and Connolly (51).</page><page sequence="8">1114 R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE been a method for graphically representing the driver's field of view from a vehicle by using polar-perspective pictures to represent important properties of three-dimensional space in two-dimensional drawing (58). This technique makes it possi- ble that perspective pictures of what can be seen through the open spaces in vehicle structure can be generated and what will be observed or obscured can be determined at an early stage in design. Also, many measures of visual performance, such as eye movement and visual search patterns can be in- cluded in perspective pictures and evaluated in the context of vehicle structure. Human factors evaluation studies have also been carried out relating to the characteristics of windshield glass. In one, the windshields of 56 automobiles measured had an average light transmission of 96.4%, with a range of 58.5-94.7%. In road tests, however, reflections of the top of the dash panel in the windshield averaged about 15.5% of the average scene lumi- nance, but ranged in one case as high as 139%. In addition, the average values of the light scattered toward the driver's eyes by dirt on the outside of the windshield were 3.5%, and for dirt on the inside of the windshield, 1 .3% of average scene luminance. Thus, "useless light" scattered towards the driv- er's eyes averages about 20.3% of the total scene luminance as measured in foot lamberts. As a result, objects of 100% con- trast may not be seen by the driver of the average automobile at more than 81% contrast during the daytime, and special conditions, such as dark objects on asphalt pavement, or ex- cessive windshield reflectances, or certain sun positions, will produce much lower contrasts (59). Most of this useless light scattered toward the driver's eyes can be eliminated by chang- ing the surface characteristics of the vehicle components re- flecting in the windshield (60, 61). The influence of glare reflected from vehicle surfaces by bright sunlight on visual discrimination is currently being studied in a project for the National Highway Safety Bureau at the Harvard School of Public Health. Chief sources of glare at different sun positions were identified, and the intensity measured in field studies. In the laboratory, luminance levels found in the field were reproduced in a simulated windshield, and measurements made of the influence on subject's ability to discriminate targets against the luminance of the wind- shield. INFLUENCE OF TINTED WINDSHIELD GLASS ON VISIBILITY AT NIGHT - One important problem has been the evaluation of the influence of tinted windshield for the safety of night driving. The adoption of heat-absorbing glaz- ing has been widespread in United States vehicles, and is con- sidered essential for cars equipped with air conditioning. There are certain advantages in reducing the glare from bright sunlight and aiding in the control of temperature within the car. The evidence from numerous laboratory studies, however, indicates that the use of any optical filter reduces visibility when the general level of illumination is low. In field experiments, Roper (62) and Heath and Finch (63) concluded that the loss in visibility through tinted windshield as compared to clear glass was small and of little practical importance. The experimental conditions, however, were such as to enhance the probability of detection of the targets. In another study of more realistic design, the losses in visi- bility distances with the tinted windshield at distances rang- ing from 200-1000 ft were between 9 and 15%, the losses being greater at the lesser distances. With targets of low con- trast, losses in visibility distance as high as 30-45% were found (64). The results of laboratory tests on the influence of tinted windshield glass on five aspects of vision- dark adaptation, visual acuity, depth perception, perception during glare, and recovery from glare- revealed no advantage from the use of the tinted glass for any of these functions (65). A marked reduction of visual acuity in night driving with green-tinted windshield glass, and a serious loss in the resolving power of the eye were reported from experiments by Miles (66). One of the most important considerations in the evaluation of tinted windshields for night driving relates to the age distri- bution of the driver population, and the decrease with age in the sensitivity of retina and on the low levels of illumination which characterize night driving. Systematic studies combining the effects of tinted wind- shield glass and age on night vision and dark adaptation have indicated that at any age the effect of the tinted glass at night is a reduction in the visibility of lights near the threshold of perception, and this effect becomes more pronounced with increasing age (67). Thus, faint lights or dim objects barely perceptible through tinted glass to a young driver will not be seen at all by the middle-aged or older driver (Fig. 2). Hence, if the decrease in light sensitivity with age is combined with the reduced transmission of light through tinted glass, a serious safety problem may arise. The most satisfactory solu- tion to eliminate this problem and at the same time retain the advantages of heat-absorbing glass seems to be to confine the shading to the portion of the windshield above the eye-level 8 I Ns240 o 5 f *=d 80-89 - p==f® 60-69 o 50-59 o 3 r 40-49 3 rife 30-39 c=c-Ê20-29 2 t.

This is now accepted practice in most United States automobiles. DESIGN OF REAR VIEW MIRRORS AND REAR VISION SYSTEMS - In addition to having adequate frontal visibility from his vehicle, the driver also needs to have rapid and accurate information of the position and movements of vehicles in the rearward hemisphere, in order to monitor the traffic situation and to safely execute such maneuvers as merges, lane changes, and stopping. He also needs rear field of view information to assist in backing and parking maneuvers, and to avoid striking any pedestrian or objects behind the vehicle while backing. The rear-vision requirements of drivers have been summarized and analyzed in detail in a recent report to the NHSB (68). A driver can see behind his vehicle either by turning and looking to the rear, or by using interior or exterior mirrors. In the former case the eyes must be moved from the forward line of sight for some period of time. By using rear-view mir- rors the same information can be obtained more quickly, while at the same time maintaining peripheral vision to the front of the vehicle. In either case it is advantageous to have rear windows as large as possible. This permits the driver to see more of the roadway to the rear, and, in addition, permits the drivers of following cars more easily to see through the cars in front of them. The interior rear-view mirror should be large enough so that the whole of the rear window can be seen at once without moving the head, and normal movements of the driver in his seat should not require this mirror to be reset (69). The ex- ternal mirror mounted on the door or fender should provide a view to the rear in the left lane, including the "blind spot" im- mediately to the left rear of the driver. These external mirrors eliminate obstructions to vision caused by persons or objects inside the vehicle, but they nevertheless usually provide a smaller field because the eye-to-mirror distance is greater. Remote control of the position of external mirrors is distinctly advantageous (70). Interior rear-view mirrors have been criticized as being "sometimes" placed completely out of the binocular field (71). The driver must turn his perceptual line of sight 55 deg off from the straight-ahead position to view the inside rear- view mirror. The scene that he perceives is generally just the lane behind him and a few feet to either side of his lane at a 50-ft distance behind his car. This is a field afforded by a 20 deg rear-view mirror. A rear-vision mirror placed inside the binocular field of view not only is closer to the forward line of sight (and thus affords better motion perception), but the image is much brighter. This author also suggests that the best way to keep the driver constantly informed of all traffic condi- tions is to place the rear-view mirror within a 30 deg cone sur- rounding his line of sight. Such a location requires no search- ing eye movements, and cars could be seen in the mirror without fixating on the mirror itself. It may be noted that the SAE Recommended Practices for mirror location and for a 20 deg rearward field of view have not been adhered to in many recent designs. The trend to lower silhouettes has resulted in lower roof lines for the back windows, and bringing the mirror into a position obstructing the driver's view (68). In one recent study, it was demon- strated that the total field of view provided by the inside and left outside mirrors resulted in blind spots such that a driver traveling in the center of a three-lane road can be completely blind to another vehicle traveling in the inside lane, and also in certain positions to his left (72). It is clear that rear-view vision can be improved by providing a wider field of view, so that the entire rearward scene could be perceived at a glance, and the advantage of binocular vision taken into account as opposed to the monocular vision used with smaller mirrors. Also, mirrors which have a smaller field of view than afforded by the rear window result in a lack of the visual frame of reference provided by the window opening, making the judgment of the distance and lateral placement of following vehicles more difficult. In the United States, the outside rear-view mirror is generally a plane, or flat, mirror which produces an image of essentially unit magnification. In Europe, image-reducing, field-enlarging, mirrors are used rather extensively, though it is quite univer- sally held that, because of the reduced image size, depth per- ception is decreased (70). Recent operational tests in the United States, on the relative visibility afforded by plane and curved mirrors, indicate that drivers using plane fender mirrors in lane-changing select longer gaps to start the maneuver than while using convex mir- rors, by as much as 2: 1 in gap acceptance distances. These also reduce the size of images, so that distant vehicles may not be seen (72). Another investigation found that drivers who were experienced in using convex mirrors tended to accept smaller gaps in traffic of the order of about a car's length while using the curved mirrors than with plane mirrors (73). Data from two unpublished studies also indicate that with convex mirrors drivers judge cars to be more distant than they are, and that, while the amount of consistent error in distance estimation depends on the experimental methods, greater variability was always present in the case of the convex mirrors. Although the use of convex mirrors can provide a wider field of view to the rear, the problems of the influence of their undesirable characteristics remain to be solved. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the development of over-the-roof periscopic systems which are capable of providing the driver with a wide horizontal field of view to the rear, of 100 deg or more. At the present stage of development, however, existing designs require that the driv- er's eye position must remain in a limited vertical range to achieve full up-and-down view, and side-to-side movement of the head reduces the field of view in the horizontal plane. With periscopes, the influence of head motion on size of the field of view is just the opposite of that with plane mirrors. VISIBILITY PROVIDED BY HEADLIGHTS - The primary function of vehicle headlights is to provide visibility of the roadway ahead of the driver at night. They also serve a secondáry function to other drivers or road users by providing cues for information on the vehicle's speed and movement. From the human standpoint, the primary problem is that of the inefficiency of the visual sensory system at the low levels</page><page sequence="10">1116 R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE of illumination prevailing during nighttime driving on un- lighted or poorly lighted streets.* For the engineer, the problem has been how to increase the intensity of headlight illumination of the roadway to enable the driver to see suf- ficiently far ahead for safety without causing glare disabling to the vision of drivers of approaching cars. Many studies have indicated the deleterious effect on visibility from oppos- ing headlights. In one experiment, with properly adjusted low beams, seeing distances for a small, dark grey, object with a 7% reflectance at the right edge of a straight road varied from about 260-350 or more feet, depending on the proximity of approaching headlights. With maximum 10,000 cp in each headlamp the equivalent distances were 300-400 ft. (The SAE maximum is now 15,000 cp.) In this study it was also observed that the recent reduction in the height of headlamps to achieve a lower vehicle silhouette, from about 31 to 25 in. above the road, has resulted in a loss of seeing distance of about 60 ft for the low beams, though the loss is negligible for the upper beams. Theoretically, about 10 ft in seeing distance will be lost for each inch the headlight height is lowered (76). In another study, it was observed that an "average" driver, using high beams and traveling at 80 mph without opposing lights, could see a pedestrian dressed in average clothing and in time to stop on dry pavement. With another car approaching, however, and both on low beams, the visibility of the pedes- trian would be reduced to the point where the safe speed for stopping in time to avoid the pedestrian would be less than 40 mph. With current low beams, if drivers exceed 50 mph on dry pavement, or 40 mph on wet, even without opposing headlights they are in danger of striking a pedestrian or other obstacles ahead because of inefficient seeing distance to stop. It was shown in the same study that on rural roads, about 75% of drivers normally operate only with low beams, even when the use of the more powerful high beams was appro- priate (77). The possible effects of perception by silhouette in relation to oncoming headlights may be another variable. The situation at the moment is that present headlights do not provide adequate illumination for safe operation at mod- ern highway speeds, and even then degrade the vision of op- posing drivers. A great deal of research is needed in this area, both in relation to current approaches to improve the distri- bution of light from headlights, or to a long-range, radical change to polarized systems. CONSIDERATIONS IN REGARD TO REAR LIGHTING DISPLAYS - With the exception of lights specifically for il- luminating the areas ahead of the vehicle, and behind while backing, the function of all other exterior lights on automo- biles is to provide information to other road users as to the presence, location, and maneuver of the vehicle. * There is extensive research literature on the subject of night visibility and visual problems of driving at night. An annotated bibliography has been published at one- or two-year intervals in publications of the Highway Research Board, compiled by O. W. Richards. He has also published a recent review on this subject (75). The importance for safety of providing rear lighting of adequate intensity was demonstrated in a comparison of pre- and postwar rear-end accidents in Great Britain. The prewar vehicles, with smaller and less bright rear lights, were found to have a frequency of being struck from the rear by a following car six times as great as with the postwar cars (78). In one New Jersey study, trucks were found to be involved in almost twice as many accidents as would be expected on the basis of vehicle exposure. Sixty-six percent of the fatalities in these truck accidents resulted from rear-end collisions, and, of these fatal accidents, 75% resulted from another vehicle strik- ing the rear of the truck. Possible explanations include greater truck width, low speed on grades, etc., but one of the primary factors was connected to the lack of effective rearward warn- ing devices to identify slow-moving or stopped vehicles (79). In the early days of slower and less dense traffic, a single rear light served to indicate the presence of a vehicle ahead on the roadway. The present system of two red taillights marking the extremes of vehicle body width was evolved to provide greater assistance for making judgments about distance and approach speeds. However, it has been observed that the present system of vehicle rear lighting is hazardous because it is often not possible to distinguish between the lights of a fast- moving, a slow-moving, and a stopped vehicle (80). There is general agreement on the need for improvement of rear lighting systems to provide the information necessary for safe driving. In recent years, a considerable amount of re- search, both from the standpoint of the basic characteristics of human vision and the testing of alternative systems and configurations of rear lighting, has been carried out. Differentiation between rear running lights and brake lights has usually depended on an increase in the luminous intensity of the same light when the brake is applied. In some cases, where separate bulbs for the brake lights have been used, they are usually still very close to the rear light, often in the same housing, and of the same color- red. Differentiating by color, as well as by intensity, has been suggested for a better distinc- tion between the two, perhaps green for normal rear running light, but red to indicate braking (81). Some believe that, for running lights, the use of red, a sym- bol of danger and a stop signal, is also wrong from the point of view of physiological optics, since red is perceived as being farther away than any other color by about two-thirds of the population. In addition, about 1% of the male population are Protanopie color defectives who may be unable to see dim red lights at all. There are clinical data indicating that this defect has led seriously protanopic drivers into dangerous driving situations (5 1 , 82). No standards for size or dimensions of rear lights are avail- able, and there are only minimum recommended limits for light intensity. However, both the size and intensity of a light source are of importance in the production of glare, which may interfere with the vision of drivers of following vehicles. There is the possibility that acceptable upper limits of intensity for rear lights may already have been exceeded in some vehicles. Rear lights of a sufficient intensity to be visi- ble in daylight at a distance of several hundred yards may be</page><page sequence="11">ERGONOMICS AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY 1117 too glaring at night. A dual-level of a high intensity for day- time driving with a lower intensity for night operation has been suggested (83). In such an arrangement, however, the intensity of directional and brake lights should always be higher than the rear taillights. Some provision may also be required for adapting to unusual daylight conditions, such as driving in fog. Rear light location may also be related to safety since it was found the braking reaction times of drivers were shorter when the brake lights of preceding vehicles were at about eye level instead of the present, lower position (83). On the basis of available evidence, red brake lights located at the driver's eye level, and separated from lower green, running lights, should afford greater safety than the existing designs. In addition, rear running lights should be visible from the sides, as well as the rear, of the vehicle. Since rear lights can also be used in estimating distances, it has been suggested that the distance between these lights be standardized. Twin lights placed very close together are of little use in this respect, but if placed 2 or 4 ft apart, a con- siderable increase in accuracy of distance estimation is ob- tained (84). Another suggested change in brake light design is the activa- tion of this light by the release of the accelerator pedal rather than by the depression of the brake pedal, thus giving the drivers of following cars a slightly earlier warning of brake application or decrease in speed. The advantages of such a system in shorter brake reaction times has been demonstrated (83). DIRECTIONAL SIGNALS - Research on the perception of directional signals and their differentiation from other lights has indicated a superiority of amber-colored lights over other colors (85-87). A major factor in the effectiveness of any turn indicator is its location on the vehicle, especially with respect to other lights. With regard to front turn indicators, a study on the perceptibility of front amber turn signals was carried out, and design criteria in terms of intensity and location in relation to headlights and chrome bumpers were formulated (88). In regard to rear directional signals, these are frequently of the same color and part of the same light which serves as the running light and brake light, thus requiring a longer period of time for the observer to determine which of the possible two or three functions the light is performing. This arrangement has been found to cause considerable confusion and numerous errors (89). When the brake and turn indicator lights are lo- cated in the same housing, the reaction time of the driver of the following car was found to be delayed by 1/2 sec in com- parison with the reaction time when these two signals were separated. Other studies have also shown that as a turn indi- cator is moved farther away from the brake light, there is a decrease in response time. When the separation distance of these two lights is less than 9 in. response time is longest (85). The flash rate of directional signals has an important influ- ence on their conspicuity and the differentiation from other functions of another light in the same housing or near by. One authority in the field of vision has suggested an optimal flash rate of about 4/ sec, with an on-off ratio of 1:1. In rela- tion to this point there are considerable experimental data on the factors influencing the perceptibility of flashing lights which are applicable to the design of such signals (45, 90). The urgent need for more information and operational re- search in the area of vehicle lighting, to provide the informa- tion required by a following driver or other road users, can be inferred from the fact that the NHSB has contracted with four separate agencies to evaluate vehicle rear lighting systems and to develop and test alternative systems and configurations as an aid to formulating federal standards in this area. Some of the reports from these studies are now available (91-93). CONTROL OF PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT In some instances, the control of highway accidents depends on the regulation of the interaction between the driver and the internal and external environments of the vehicle. The more important physical variables of the environment are temperature, humidity and ventilation, noise, vibration, and carbon monoxide. Extremes of any of these variables will result in discomfort and lowered efficiency of the driver. The ranges of comfort and discomfort and the extremes that may contribute to accidents have been reasonably well defined (94). Certain aspects of highway design and the influence of weather conditions on driving safety are not considered here. TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND VENTILATION - A change in any one of these variables will affect the other two, insofar as they influence comfort. Hence, all three vari- ables must be considered as a unit. The ventilation problem is concerned with the amount of fresh air and air movement provided in the vehicle. Low rates of air movement produce feelings of stuffiness and fail to prevent the accumulation of body odors and tobacco smoke. Optimally, 35-40 cfm of fresh air should be supplied per indi- vidual at velocities of between 20-60 fpm, in order to main- tain an atmosphere of freshness without creating undesirable drafts. It should be remembered that increased air velocities tend to have a cooling effect, which may be advantageous in summer but which may cause discomfort in winter. Poor ventilation causes lethargy and sleepiness and can contribute to accidents. Composite curves have been developed to show the various comfort zones (95). The optimum temperature range is 68- 72 F (dry bulb) for winter and 74-78 F for summer. A rela- tive humidity of 30-70% is acceptable in these zones. Exces- sively high humidities cause discomfort at high temperatures and result in feelings of coolness or dampness at low tempera- tures. When humidity is below 15%, the membranes of the eyes, nose, and throat become uncomfortably dry (16). Ex- periments with industrial workers have shown that human per- formance deteriorates significantly at effective temperatures of about 83 deg (the equivalent of 83 F at 1 00% humidity) and above (96, 97). Many of the skills that show deterioration are directly related to safe driving. NOISE - In most passenger automobiles noise levels are sufficiently low to require few design changes for driver</page><page sequence="12">1118 R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE health and safety. However, the amount of noise produced by some commercial vehicles presents a serious problem. In seven truck models tested for overall noise levels within the cab, it was found that the range was 48-89 dB with the cab closed and the engine idling. In those models that were road-tested under normal operating conditions the second- and third-gear noise levels were between 80 and 95 dB, and in fourth gear the noise level was just below 90 dB. Octave-band analysis of the noise outside trucks revealed that heavy trucks reached a peak of 93 dB in the 75-100-cps frequency band, dropping to 80 dB in the 600-4800-cps band (98). Measurements made on a passenger automobile during the same investigation showed a maximum of only 64 dB in the 150-300-cps band. The wide difference in noise levels between the quietest and the noisiest trucks indicates, however, that some designers have been able to make improvements in noise control. VIBRATION - Vibration in motor vehicles leads to discom- fort and fatigue in driving operations, and there is increasing evidence that serious physical disorders may result from pro- tracted exposure to excessive vibration. Even under less ex- treme conditions, visual acuity is affected and certain reflexes are diminished. Determining the physiologic limits of human tolerance to vibration is of great importance; especially needed are medical and engineering studies of the effects of vibration beyond the tolerance limits for health, safety, and efficiency. The subjective reaction of the driver varies with the fre- quency and amplitude of the vibration. In general, the higher the frequency, the lower the amplitude must be to maintain a given level of comfort. Also, as frequencies increase, the effect of vibration tends to become localized, whereas, with low frequencies, the whole body may be involved. Most of the frequencies encountered in motorized equipment are low, that is, 8 cps or less. Reviews of the research relating tó human response to vibration are available, and may be con- sulted for further detail (97, 99). CARBON MONOXIDE - Carbon monoxide poisoning is an ever-present possibility in the operation of motor vehicles. The problem is becoming increasingly serious because of the amount of smog and the concentration of idling vehicles in metropolitan areas. Small amounts of carbon monoxide are absorbed rapidly by the bloodstream, resulting in an oxygen deficiency that may at first be unnoticed by the individual. The initial reaction to carbon monoxide poisoning consists primarily in lowered attention, difficulty in concentration and ool~ |gr* £ % Ä ^ uû ° ip H £ ip c a ,° e a. c 3 / / ^ ^ § e a. sì / f liv a. / ^ / -V / W* ' ' I Ē 1 Upper limiti NOISE- &gt;94 - db I I 85 db I 175 "F 1&gt;1Q0 °F TEMPERATURE NOISE- - I oďbl 1 65 F |&lt;30°F °F (decibels) li I Lower limit J avoid continued silence 1 Ł% / /V ¿/J ' %' "O &amp;/ i/ I" "&gt; &amp;/ ¿luí ' ^ &amp;/ -g ¿luí A ' '' š A* ^ 4&gt; £ ^ È &lt;? oc E % ^ £ P £ H-.2 ^ Fig. 3 - Physical variables of environment which influence driver comfort, efficiency, and safety.

(Adapted from various sources)</page><page sequence="13">ERGONOMICS AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY 1119 retention, slight muscular incoordination, sleepiness, and men- tal and physical lethargy. These effects could easily contri- bute to an accident. One of the earliest demonstrable effects of carbon monoxide is the reduction of the sensitivity of the eye under low il- lumination. For example, chronic cigarette smokers are known to have 4-8% carboxyhemoglobin in their blood, an amount that corresponds, in effect, to an altitude of about 7000 ft. If additional amounts are received from the exhaust system of the vehicle, a dangerously high level of oxygen deficiency may result (16). In motor vehicles dangerous con- centrations of carbon monoxide usually result from leaks in the exhaust system and from openings in the floorboards or other parts of the vehicle body. It is desirable to limit the amount of carbon monoxide to 0.003%. A problem of current interest is whether driver performance may be adversely influenced during periods of exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide. One study has shown a decre- ment in the ability to judge periods of time (100). Another pilot study has been reported on the influence of small amounts of CO on driver performance, as measured in an instrumented car (101). An extensive project in this area has also been initiated at Harvard. A schematic interpretation of the various stimuli en- countered in driving is given in Fig. 3 in terms of the limits for comfort, discomfort, and injury. Because of the inter- dependence of the variables, these values should not be considered rigid standards. The difficulty in giving a single numerical value as a standard is exemplified by the limits indicated for carbon monoxide and vibration. The generally accepted maximum value for prolonged exposures is 100 ppm of carbon monoxide in circulating air. This amount may be satisfactory for a person sitting quietly at sea level, but it must be smaller if the amount of exercise, the degree of ventilation, or the length of exposure is increased. The per- missible amplitudes indicated for vibration apply only to frequencies of 8 cps or less; however, frequencies high than this are probably not a major factor in automobile operation. Linear scales or straight-line functions are not so adaptable to the study of human variables as are nomograms, in which one can ascertain the effects that altering any one variable has upon the other variables. FATIGUE Except in cases where drivers have fallen asleep at the wheel, the role of fatigue in highway accidents may be quite subtle and has not been susceptible to precise measure- ment. This is not simply a matter of relating hours of driving to accident frequencies. For example, 60% of the accidents in truck transportation were found to occur within the first 3 hr of driving rather than near the end of the day's run. The amount and quality of previous rest, time since the last rest, the nature of activities before driving, and concurrent emotional stress, are some of the numerous complicating factors (102). In a study carried out under the U. S. Public Health Service, it was demonstrated that subjects perform less well on a variety of psychologic and psychomotor tests after protracted periods of driving. This finding was interpreted to indicate reduced efficiency and, hence, increased liability to accidents. Regulations concerning hours of driving and intervening rest periods of drivers in interstate commerce were adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission after this study. Confidential interviews with professional long-haul truck drivers have revealed that under conditions of extreme fatigue, hallucinations and illusions of obstacles on the high- way are not uncommon. Some accidents have occurred as a result of the maneuvers carried out by drivers to avoid animals or objects "perceived" on the roadway. Experiences of this kind were reported by 30 of the sample of 50 long-haul drivers interviewed (102). A concept of "skill fatigue" that has been developed from experiments in England on the effects of protracted operation on skilled performance may provide a clearer understanding of the ways in which fatigue affects the efficiency of the driver (103). One early effect involves changes in the timing of reactions. Gross mistakes may appear at later stages, but at first the right response is made but at the wrong time. As fatigue increases, the field to which the driver is responding as a whole loses its integrated quality, and he reacts to individual aspects of it. Certain stimuli predominate, whereas others may be ignored and important responses omitted. For example, after halting for a "stop" sign at an intersection where there are no traffic lights, the tired driver may wait for a green light to signal the time to proceed, or, intent on a clear roadway on the other side of an intersection, he may derive no meaning from the headlights he sees coming from the side. As skill fatigue develops, standards of performance deteriorate, and the operator thinks he is doing as well as previously whereas actually he is driving less skillfully and no longer recognizes or appreciates his errors. Loss of insight into the seriousness of the situations en- countered is a characteristic of skill fatigue that has the most important implications for safety. A review of research relating to fatigue in driving has re- cently been carried out in Great Britain, suggested practically no correlation between length of driving time per se, or to changes in driving behavior involving increased risk (104). One of the problems has been the lack of a reliable way of measuring fatigue or defining driver performance. One tech- nique employed in recent years has involved the concept of "spare mental capacity," that is, the ability of a driver to carry out a subsidiary task, such as mental arithmetic, or monitoring a peripheral display, while carrying out the driving task. In one such study it was reported that a virtually continuous 12-hr period of driving need not necessarily affect driving performance adversely (105). In a more recent study, the same investigator has reported that experienced observers were able to discern changes in the driving skills in drivers after 7 hr of continuous driving. They found a decrement of perceptual judgment and a reduction of courtesy to other users of the road (106). In the United States, in recent years, attempts have been</page><page sequence="14">1 120 R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE made to develop objective measures of driver performance through the application of advances in electronics and auto- matic continuous observation and recording. Instrumentation has been developed to monitor and record the control actions made by the driver while operating the vehicle. This yields such indices of performance as frequency of steering wheel reversals, accelerator and brake responses, velocity variations, among others. Some pilot studies have now been carried out to assess the effects of protracted driving in these terms (107). Further research in this area should also include the influence of the various combinations of stresses improved by protracted driving, not only in terms of safety, but in the long- term effects on the health of drivers. CRASH INJURY RESEARCH This important area of research had its beginnings in the work of Hugh DeHaven, who demonstrated the potential of design features for preventing injuries in crashes of light air- craft. Early application in the automotive field included work at Cornell Aeronautical Lab. on the kinematic behavior of the body under abrupt deceleration, and the inflation of the ex- tensive data collection program of the Cornell Automotive Crash Injury Research. Techniques for conducting experi- mental crashes were developed with instrumented dummies and vehicles, to determine the forces to which vehicles and occupants are subjected, and in recent years a great deal of sophisticated research has been devoted to various aspects of this field at many research centers and within the automotive industry. The new research findings relating to crash injury prevention have been presented at fourteen Stapp Car Crash Conferences, now held annually, sponsored by SAE. MEDICAL-ENGINEERING COLLABORATION IN PRE- VENTION OF INJURY - Two considerations are essential in devising measures to prevent or attenuate injurious energy exchanges which result: the identification of the "carriers" or "vectors" of energy, which then may be modified, and a knowledge of injury thresholds of the human body as design criteria in relation to the magnitude of the forces encountered in accident situations. These are of particular importance for the prevention of injury in motor vehicle crashes, and little precise information has previously been available. Recent developments have included extensive analyses of injuries in motor vehicle accidents, on-the-site medical-engineering analyses of accidents, experimental crashes of instrumented cars containing instrumented anthropometric dummies, and laboratory studies on injury thresholds using cadavers or animals. Analysis of Motor Vehicle Injuries - The relative frequency of injury to various parts of the body in motor vehicle crashes has been studies in a number of investigations. Characteris- tically, head injuries have been found to be the most frequent, followed by leg, arm, and chest injuries, in that order (108) (Fig. 4). Another recurrent finding has been that multiple injuries are found in motor vehicle accident victims in about 60% of the cases. In one study, some 30% received injuries to three or more body areas, about as many had injuries to two body areas, and in only about a third of the cases was the injury confined to a single body area (109). It has also been observed that variations in the frequency of injury, and in injury patterns, are related to seated position in the car and portions of the vehicle structure causing injury. These findings have very important implications for the medical and surgical management of those injured on the highway and for determining therapeutic priorities. This type of knowledge should be of direct significance in knowing what to look for when injured persons are brought to the hospital or operating room. "Vectors" of Destructive Energy in Crashes - Information on the parts of car interior structures producing injury when im- pacted by vehicle occupants has come from the Cornell Auto- motive Crash Injury Project. These data indicate the relative importance of structural components of automobiles in caus- ing injuries in different types of accidents occurring on rural highways (109) (Fig. 5). In urban accidents, where inter- section accidents predominate, door structures become re- latively more important. In a recent on-the-spot study of traffic accidents in Adelaide, Australia, data on the locations of body impacts of injured drivers and front -seat passengers were obtained. Head impacts tend to cluster near the top of the windshield and doors; knee impacts cluster on the lower part of the instrument panel; thorax and upper limb impacts involve the steering wheel and doors (1 10). Such data are extremely important to automotive engineers, since they can identify areas requiring modifications to improve the crash protection design of vehicle interiors (Fig. 6). Analysis of the accidents in this series revealed that pe- destrians are rarely run over, but usually are run under. The analysis of the kinematics of pedestrian accidents shows a typi- cal sequence of impacts sustained by the pedestrian, which is greatly influenced by the size and configuration of the front of the striking car. Of interest also is a study of the occurrence of facial injuries in motor vehicle accidents, which was part of a larger study of Body zones at risk Distribution of injuries '(fļ I / Chest 25.5% 34.5% Knee impact j M ļ Abdomen l|6.9 %|T Fig. 4 - Body zones of risk, and distribution of injuries in motor car oc- cupants.

Almost all persons receiving max- illofacial injuries were front-seat occupants. Windshield glass caused 50% of the facial injuries, with passengers and drivers both equally involved (1 1 1). These investigators have more recently reported that the new improved laminated penetra- tion-resistant windshield glass, introduced in 1966, is signifi- cantly reducing facial lacerations in crashes, without increasing intracranial or neck injuries. Forces Involved in Motor Vehicle Crashes - The engineer, in designing crash protection, needs information on the magni- tude of forces to which vehicles and their occupants may be exposed in crashes, including the rates of onset of the decelera- CAUSE OF INJURY Instrument Panel ļflļļļļļļļ^^ B Door Structures MM- llll^^É Election j HI 88888 I 1 iH 1888 Election j 88888 1 1888 front impact Backrest of Ft.

A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE tive forces. At present, the manufacturers of automobiles are conducting experimental crashes to obtain information lead- ing to better energy-absorbing characteristics of the vehicle structure, as well as for implications in crash-protection of oc- cupants. However, studies on the determination of the forces involved in crashes were pioneered at the Institute of Trans- portation and Traffic Engineering of UCLA. In this series of projects, data from a variety of accident configurations have been recorded, using instrumented vehicles occupied by instru- mented anthropomorphic dummies (for example, Ref. 112). In general, it has been shown that the more severe the impact in a crash, the greater the likelihood of injury and the greater the severity of the injuries. Determination of Injury Thresholds - The outstanding exper- iments by Col. Stapp, riding his rocket sled in the New Mexico desert, demonstrated that a fully restrained human can with- stand rather extraordinary degrees of deceleration, without suffering more than transient injury. Findings from these ex- periments indicated that an adequately restrained person should be able to survive a 50-mph head-on crash into a stone wall without injury. In some severe crashes, the decelerative forces exceed the point of survivability, where internal organs tear loose and fluid hydraulic effects occur, even in the fully restrained per- son. In perhaps most of the crashes resulting in injury, how- ever, forces of such magnitude are not encountered, and atten- uating the forces to minimize injury is a realistic possibility. For this, information is needed on the injury thresholds of the various parts of the body which are frequently, or more seri- ously, involved. As already noted, head injury is the most frequent one in 240 r- 220- 200- 180- 160- 2 ° 140- 2 ' J 120- ' UJ €.

Curve shows force-time re- lationships at threshold for moderate concussion when forehead im- pacts on hard, flat surface (113) crashes and is the leading cause of fatality. Also, the sequelae of head injury are often more important for conducting a sub- sequent normal life than in injuries to other parts of the body, for example, lacerations of soft tissue or fractures of extremi- ties. Thus, it is extremely important to protect the head, and knowledge of the force thresholds for concussion or skull frac- ture is essential for the development of preventive measures. Research in this area is currently going on at a number of cen- ters; that being conducted by a team of physicians and engi- neers in the Biomechanics Research Center of Wayne State University has been one of the outstanding programs. Early in this work, the dry skull was found to fracture at en- ergies of about 30 in.-lb when dropped on a hard steel surface. Later experiments, using intact heads, showed the scalp had im- portant energy-absorbing characteristics, forces resulting in skull fracture reaching levels of 400-700 lb. Since concussion and closed-head injuries without fracture are frequently more serious than skull fracture, living animals were then used in or- der to study the physiological reactions, and to determine the brain injuries by pathological examination. This made it possi- ble to derive the time-pressure relationships for concussion. This work has since been extended to human cadavers, with brain tissue removed and replaced with a gelatin of the same specific gravity. Pressure transducers were inserted in the skull, and accelerometers mounted on the back of the skull opposite the point of impact. Pressure and acceleration measurements were obtained when the cadavers were dropped with the forehead striking a steel plate. The pressure-accelera- tion data were then combined with clinical observations of concussion to show the acceleration and time relationships in the production of moderate concussion from forehead impact with a hard flat surface (113) (Fig. 7). In the past few years, quite a few studies relating to the in- jury thresholds of the human body and its various parts, and to the biomechanics of injury, have been carried out. How- ever, many of the data must be considered preliminary, since the data have been extrapolated from tests on animals, or from tests using human cadavers. Variations related to age, sex, and body build are not known, and the body areas studied for im- pact tolerance thus far have been limited chiefly to the head, chest, and knee areas. Further research to develop human tol- erance data for establishing design criteria is of vital impor- tance. HUMAN FACTORS RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN HIGHWAY SAFETY In concluding this overview, it may be of interest to indicate some of the major centers in the United States and abroad where research programs in highway safety include ergonomics and human engineering aspects. It would not be possible here to list all such organizations, but a few representative examples will be selected, and the type of work emphasized briefly out- lined. UNITED STATES - Mention should be made of the impetus to research through the National Traffic and Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, and the</page><page sequence="17">ERGONOMICS AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY 1123 activities of the National Highway Safety Bureau related to the promulgation of National Standards for the safe design of vehicles. In addition to the research stimulated within the automotive industry by these developments, many studies have been undertaken by university groups and other research organizations, under contracts invited by the NHSB, to pro- vide data to assist in the evaluation of existing standards, and the development of new ones. A number of these investiga- tions are in the field of human factors, and have been men- tioned in this report. Details on the projects sponsored by the NHSB may be found in its annual publication, "Executive Summaries, National Highway Safety Bureau Contractors Re- ports," and in its weekly bulletin, "Highway Safety Litera- ture." Harvard School of Public Health , Boston , Mass. - An exten- sive series of projects concerned with human factors in high- way safety has been carried out during the past 20 years. In- cluded have been analyses of accidents in the trucking indus- try, and the human factors evaluation of trucks and automo- biles. Anthropometric and biomechanical data have been de- veloped from samples of truck drivers and other occupational groups, and more recently from the general population, to pro- vide design criteria. Studies have also been made in the field of night visibility, with special attention to the influence of age and tinted windshield glass. A major area of study has re- lated to the analysis of accident causation in terms of the in- teraction between the driver, the vehicle, and the environment, employing the methods of biostatistics and epidemiology. Other work has included studies of drivers' eye movements, and studies of the abilities of amputee drivers. Cornell Automotive Crash Injury Research (now at the Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. ) Buffalo, N. Y. - Procedures were developed to collect data on injuries in rural automobile accidents in several states, and to relate the injuries to struc- tural and design components of vehicles and accident circum- stances. One of the important early findings was that if per- sons remained with the vehicle, and were properly restrained, chances of survival were significantly greater. The ACIR data have been the basis for a number of features introduced in ve- hicles to prevent crash injury. Another area of research at CAL relates to the development of mathematical models of driver- vehicle performance, and computer simulation of acci- dents. Institute of Transportation and Traffic Engineering, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles, Calif - Over a period of many years controlled crashes of various types have been conducted using instrumented cars containing instrumented dummies. Much information on the magnitude of the forces generated in collisions, and on occupant response to the forces, has re- sulted. Studies have also included the influence of a large number of driver characteristics on driving performance, utili- zing highly sophisticated simulation equipment and tech- niques. Biomechanics Research Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, Mich. - This research program has been concerned with determining impact thresholds for skull fracture and con- cussion, and has been outlined previously in this paper. Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. - This institute, which was established through funds given by the automotive industry, is engaged in a broad program of research on highway safety, including such human factors areas as injury thresholds of the head, mechan- isms of injury, vehicle handling qualities, analysis of accident data, driver attributes, visibility requirements in driving, and vehicle lighting and signaling systems. The institute's new building and extensive research facilities were dedicated in October 1969. Systems Research Group, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. - The research has chiefly been concerned with the anal- ysis of driving behavior and the development of objective mea- surements of driving performance. The feasibility and influ- ence of providing necessary information to the driver through electronic aids in carrying out highway maneuvers has also been studied, as well as the influence of protracted driving, and of low levels of carbon monoxide on driver performance. GREAT BRITAIN AND EUROPE - Road Research Laboratory, Ministry of Transport, Crowthorne, Berkshire, U. K. - Although this group was origi- nally concerned with the design of highways and related sub- jects, in recent years studies involving human factors in high- way safety have been numerous and important. These topics have included the visibility through windshields and windows, optimal color and location of turn signals, visual acuity with yellow headlighting, human tolerance to vibration, analysis of drivers' eye movements, peripheral vision and distance judg- ments, methods of analyzing driver behavior, the effects of protracted driving, the influence of alcohol on driving, and var- ious aspects of crash injury. Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cam- bridge, England. - The studies of this group include a wide variety of human performances, and the many factors influ- encing performance. Numerous reports relate to the design of controls and displays. The selection of colors for signal lights, and information processing and decision making have received considerable attention. In the automotive field, specifically, studies have been made in relation to objective measures of driving performance, particularly in reference to fatigue and risk taking. Department of Psychology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden. - Among areas investigated are visibility distances and speed relationships in night driving, influence of smoking on night visibility, information aspects of road signs, effect of prolonged driving on visual reaction times, and effects of tran- quilizers in simulated driving. Talja, Central Organization for Traffic Safety, Helsinki, Finland. - Areas of interest include factors affecting the per- ception of road signs, driver decision making in reference to in- tersection accidents, driver characteristics and accident rates, and the influence of speed limits and police supervision on driver behavior. Institute for Road Safety Research, Voorburg, The Nether- lands. - Recent research has been concerned with the legibility of signs, the effectiveness of different configurations of rear</page><page sequence="18">1 124 R. A. McFARLAND AND R. C. MOORE lighting of vehicles, effectiveness of visual warning signals, and analysis of the driving task. Institute of Perception, Soesterberg , The Netherlands. - The work relating to automotive safety has included studies of pe- ripheral vision in vehicles, and studies of the time required by elderly drivers in making successive eye fixations in relation to the convergence-accommodation mechanism. Research to im- prove the quality of tests of visual acuity has also been carried out. The influence of various design parameters of outside rear-view mirrors has also been investigated. Many basic stud- ies on human vision and visual perception have been carried out by this group during the past 20 years. Max-Planck-Institut für Arbeitsphysiologie, Dortmund, Fed- eral German Republic - This research center has long been known for its extensive research in ergonomics, especially in relation to the influence of environmental factors and working conditions on workers. The influence of noise, temperature, and vibration has received particular attention. A number of studies have been concerned with the application of ergonomie principles in automotive design. Recent work has been carried out relating to impact thresholds of injury, especially in regard to parameters of headrest design. AUSTRALIA - Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Mel- bourne, Melbourne, Australia. - Some human factors research has been sponsored by the Human Factors Committee of the Australian Road Research Council, especially medical-engineer- ing studies of injuries in accidents. The group most active in human factors research, at present, however, is at the Univer- sity of Melbourne. Here studies have emphasized the analysis of the driving task, the influence of vehicle handling properties on driver behavior, and the communications functions of traf- fic controls. SUMMARY The purpose of this paper has been to present the use of er- gonomics in the design of vehicular equipment. It is proposed that the wider use of the principles and methods of this disci- pline might aid in the more effective integration of the driver and his equipment. It has been shown that the effectiveness of any man-machine system depends upon the integration of the biological characteristics of the operator with the mechanical design of the equipment and working areas. The initial phase of a program in ergonomics should always consist of an ad- vance analysis of the equipment, including a survey of the na- ture of the task, the work surroundings, the location of con- trols and instruments, and the way the operator performs his duties. The basic data needed include those which describe the range of human body size at rest and in motion; biome- chanical abilities including range, strength, speed, and accuracy of motion; sensory abilities; and human reactions to the physi- cal variables of the environment. Only by the application of these kinds of data to the design of the workspace, controls, instruments, and environment, can the owner be assured of maximum comfort, efficiency, and safety. In highway safety the application of human engineering prin- ciples has been shown to be of great importance in the design of windshields, rear-view mirrors, and vehicle lighting, and other visual aids to the drivers. The field of crash injury re- search is proving to be especially important in understanding the parts of the vehicle most likely to give rise to injury. Cur- rent research is tending to give more precise measurements not only in regard to the forces involved, but also to the thresholds and patterns of injury. The various research programs in the field of ergonomics as related to highway safety in various parts of the world have greatly increased in recent years. In conclusion, it is important to note that human factors engi- neers are in an unusually favorable position to assist in improv- ing the accident rates in industry and in various forms of trans- portation including highway safety.
