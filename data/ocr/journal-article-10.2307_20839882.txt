<plain_text><page sequence="1">QUR'ANIC ANTHROPOMORPHISMS J.M.S. Batjon One of the binding lines of conduct in the traditions of Islam discussing, wvtz\ aJUa, customs followed by Muliammad is the prohibition to strike a fellowman at the face, since the Prophet once declared: "When anyone of you fights with his brother, he should avoid his face, for God created Adam in His own form"1. However, in the still more authoritative sacred text of the Muslims, the Qur'?n, no express mention is made of man's being created in God's image. It merely states that God created him in the nicest build (Q. XCV:?). Yet, it does not hesitate to speak of God's face, hands and eyes. Also various human qualities are attributed to Him. But compared with the Bible, this Holy Book makes a clearly more sparing use of anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms. Now, the striking thing is that notwithstanding this, in comparison with the Bible, fairly moderate application of anthropo morphisms by the Qur'?n, the Muslims prove to be puzzled by those divine analogies of human nature found in the Qur'?n to a far greater extent than the Christian exegetes of the Bible. What is actually the proper way of looking at them: Are they to be taken literally, or do they ask for a figurative interpretation, or is a mediatory position on this point conceivable? In the history of Islamic thought a good deal of controversy has taken place on this tricky question. In general, three solutions offered can be discerned. 1. The Stance of the Advocates of taj&amp;im (anthropo morphism). To their mind God is a body, flesh and blood in the form of e man, has three dimensions and colour, but not taste, smell and touch, is in a parti cular place and moves about after the creation. Accordingly, the Qur'?nic anthropomorphisms had to be taken literally.</page><page sequence="2">120 Islamic Studies, 27:2 (1988) 2. The View of the Mu'tazilites who strived to formulate Muslim faith in terms acceptable to the intellectuals. They were of the opinion that God cannot be des cribed, is not substance nor attribute, and is not subject to directions. He is in the world in the sense that He controls it, not as a spatial presence. So they gave a metaphorical interpretation to every anthropomorphic expression in the Qur'?n. Thus, for instance, God's hand stands for His might or bounty. 3. Being in every community the belief of the majority, orthodoxy ordinarily adopts a mediatory position on points of doctrine. According to its teachings, God has face and hands because the Qur'an states the fact. Though the fact as such is known, the manner of it is unknown. All this is to be considered bi M kayi, without asking questions. Man ought not to concern himself with things that have not been rendered subject to his thought. The interpretation of these expressions should be left to the discretion of God. The only statement that can be pronounced is that God's hands, face and so on, are *as a quality, just as hearing and sight'2. A Western student of the Qur'?n is in favour of the principle that the Holy Book itself is its best, i.e. most impartial, interpre ter. For that reason we intend in this paper to work out possible clues the Qur'an affords for the way it itself takes the anthropo morphisms recorded. Who, after all, are put in the right by the Qur'an: the literalists, the allegorizers, or the people- who say *God knows best'? If we want to infer the main theme of the Qur'?nic teaching about God, we certainly come out with the announcement that He is the merciful Benefactor. The names Rahman (merciful), tahZm (com passionate), gha??/? (forgiving), gha^ai (ever-forgiving) most fre quently occur in this Holy Book. And the Dutch scholar Snouck Hurgronje acted completely in line with Muslim feelings and convictions when, in pursuit of what is called Xzk?x al-it?im, i.e. to become a Muslim unto the Muslims, -he introduced himself to the people of the Hij?z as *Abd al-gha^ai, servant of the Ever forgiving. At the same time, it is not less true that the Allah of the Qur'an in His transcendent perfections and in His dealings with the world represents an inscrutable mystery. "The advantage", the famous Muslim mystic al-Ghaz?l? argues, "that mystics and prophets have over others in knowing God is that they are more awake to and more certain of the fact of His unknowability"3. Yet, in spite of its forceful sense of God's otherness and transcendence, the Qur'?n records that the Almighty has a face, eyes and hands, granted a covenant to the race of Adam in</page><page sequence="3">Islamic Studies, 27:2 (1988) 121 pre-eternity (Q. VII: 172), and dwells on His throne (Q. XX:5), etc. However, a Muslim will rightly point out that in this respect the Qur'?n shows much more diffidence than the Old Testament, and avoids in its use of anthropomorphic terms the record of so-called weak human qualities. Thus, for instance, there is no mention of a God who is said to be repentant as in the case of Jahwfe: "it repented the Lord that He had made man on the earth" (Genesis VI, verse 6). Instead, in the Qur'?n Allah is named at-tau)u)?b (Q. II: 37), i.e. the Revoker: He goes back on His condemnation of the sinner as He likes to do being the All-Compassionate Lord. Sh?h Wall Allah of Delhi (d. 1762) remarks that the use of anthropomorphism is permissible on condition that these terms offer not the least occasion for the idea that animal slurs are cast on God's Essence.... Hence, one can say of God that He sees and hears, but not that He tastes and touches'1. In addition to this observation of the Delhi scholar, I would like to raise the question: Can one as ^ a Muslim, on the basis of the Qur'?n, claim that Allah loves man, and that man is allowed to speak of his love of God? Here 1 submit, many Muslims may feel a bit uneasy, as this notion could imply a kind of equality on the assumption that only between equals love is supposable. In his well-known study God Justice Daud Rahbar declares that in connection with Allah he prefers to render ahabba by 4 to like or to approve' (instead of its usual version 4to love'). And "if we adopt the translation 4loves' for yukibbu when it is used (in the Qur'?n) with God as the subject, nowhere do we find the idea that God loves mankind. God's love is conditional. He loves those who do good, those who turn repentant to Him, and so on. Unqualified Divine love for mankind is an idea completely alien to the Qur'?n"? In particular, this last peremptory pronouncement "an idea completely alien to the Qur'?n" provoked me to prepare a paper in Dutch, entitled "De Liefde Gods in de Koran"6. I offer some of my conclusions: First, the most fundamental driving motive evoking God's love of man is shown in the Qur'?n: "On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness the allmerciful shall assign love" (XIX: 96). This agrees with Rahbar's claim that God's love, as described in the Qur'?n, is conditional, is, what we might say 4provided with a rational motive'. The ascertainement that God's love of man is well grounded is reiterated in the majority of texts dealing with divine love. The 4majority', but not all of them! Some remarkable exceptions can be noticed: on occasion Allah might bestow the free and unlimited largesse of His condescending favour on men. In Q. XX:39 there is mention of an amoK Vei which takes preserving care of the child Moses, and God reminds Moses that at the time he was put into the papyrus craddle "1 loaded on thee love from Me"</page><page sequence="4">122 Islamic Studies, 27:2 (1988) Even more significant is a passage in the Qur'?n (V:54) which testifies to a yearning love of God, It seems that He is constantly in need of men who might love Him: "0 ye who believe, if any from among you turn back from his religion, God will assuredly produce a people He will love, and who will love Him". A specific expression of unconditional and irrational love is Allah's election of Adam and Jonah notwithstanding their bad record. Thus we read in the Qur'?n: "And Adam disobeyed his Lord, and so he erred. Thereafter his Lord chose him, and turned again to him" (Q. XX: 121 f.); and 4'Had not grace from his Lord reached the Man of the Firh, he would hae been cast upon the wilderness, in disgrace. Thus did his hord choose him and place him among the righteous" (Q. LXVI11: 49). Let us now return to our starting-point, that is the apparently awkward position we are put in by the Qur'?n which on the one hand warns us that God is * incomparable': "not any one is equal to Him" (Q. CXII:4); "Like Him there is none" (Q. LII:11), and on the other hand does not shrink from the use of plain anthropo morphisms: "God said: *0 Ib??s, what prevented your bowing to one 1 created with My own two hands?'" (Q. XXXVI1I:75); "Then We said to Noah: *Make the Ark under Our eyes'" (Q. XXIII:27); "We (the servants of God) feed you (the poor, orphan, captive) for the sake of God's face" (Q. LXXVI:9); "When (at the world's end) the earth shall become fine dust scattered, and thy Lord comes" (Q. LXXX1X:22). "Comes", in other words, is a movement in place which contradicts the idea of a God who is omnipresent. The way out of this dilemma found by Muslim orthodoxy is, as mentioned above, the synthetic principle of the ?golden mean*, a middle position between t&amp;tkbth (?likening', the claim that God can be likened to things created) and ta'pl (denying God all attributes). The compromise itself is defined by the jianbalites and Ash'arites7 as bi f? kayi u)a t? taAhbXh, without how and without likening, i.e. we renounce the possibility of fathoming the meaning of anthropomorphisms because this is only known to God, and we acknowledge that there exists no analogy between them and human hands, eyes, face, and so on. Or to express the same idea in the words of M?lik b. Anas (d. 795): "God's sitting on the throne is known, but how this is to be understood is unknown; believing this is a duty, questioning it a</page><page sequence="5">Islamic Studies, 27:2 (1988) 123 heresy". J.W. Sweetman concludes that such withdrawing of the human element from expressions and ideas regarding the godhead is equivalent to the ascription of qualities to God in Mii&amp;i zmvizn t?OH?*. A.J. Arberry seems to support this elucidation of Sweetman when rendering anthropomorphisms like al-?amk al-bat?i as All hearing, and All-seeing9, obviously in distinction to man, who is merely hearing and seeing. Even more ingenious is a similar solution of Aijmad al-Ghaz?l? (d. 1126) who distinguishes in his Samnih between divine love which penetrates into the innermost heart, and human love which does not reach out farther than the *kagk?&amp;f the membrane around the heart, as one may gather from (Q. X1I:29) where it is said about Joseph that his love hard only touched the membrane of Zulaykh?'s heart.le It is time now to tackle the central question: Does the Qur'?n by itself provide any clue for the way anthropomorphisms might be approached; or to put it in a more concrete manner: does it somehow justify a metaphorical interpretation of them, or is it a condemnable method inevitably leading to a misrepresentation of the evident intent of the Holy Book and its message? To begin with, efforts of attributing a symbolic meaning to anthropomorphisms will surely not derive any support from Muslim orthodoxy. In his commentary on the Hanaf?-M?tur?di11 text Fiqk Akbax II *AH al-Q?r? al-Haraw? (d. 1605) observes: As a natter of fact, 1 have found that the theological fathers unanimously say that it is not allowed to interpret the hand of God metaphorically... On this point they make a distinction between Wtiil (metaphorical interpretation) and ta{md (leaving the interpretation of anthropomorphic expressions to Allah)12. Ta'vM is a speciality of mystics and Shi4ites, as well as of Mu4tazilites. A famous representative of the latter, *Abd al-Jabb?r (d. 1025) remarks in the important handbook of his dogmatics ai-Mut?t Wt-takJOli If there occur in the Qur'an verses that suppose by their outward meaning a similarity (between God and this world), they need ta'uM because such expressions can be interpreted in more ways.13 "In more ways": this refers to the view that anthropomor phisms belong to the category of the mutath?bih?t, Qur'?nic passages which are ambiguous and not clearly intelligible. In trying to discover the true sense of Qur'?nic anthropomorphisms, the Mu'tazilites (a) make use of linguistic arguments, and (b) place these non-clearly-intelligible terms against the background of the totality of the Islamic revelation.</page><page sequence="6">124 Islamic Studies, 27:2 (1988) Both of these are methods which will surely meet the approval of presentday scholars of Islam. Let us first examine what kind of means we have at our disposal in respect of linguistic arguments. To start with: how does this matter stand as regards the language we are speaking? The Webster's New Twentieth CtnixxKij V?ct noLKy shows that in English the hand can convey a symbolic sense in view of its grasping or gripping function; specifically, (a) possession; as, the papers are not in my hands; (b) control, power, authority; as, he rules with an iron hand; (c) care, charge, supervision; as, the child is in good hands; (d) agency, influence; as, one can see his hand in the affair; (e) an active part, share; as, take a hand in this work. Four figurative senses can be attached to the concept 4eye'. As for a possible metaphorical interpretation of the word 'face', that is to say as indicative of favour, Webster quotes a Biblical passage. In Proverbs VII, verse 15, a woman who endeavours to persuade an unwary promenader to engage in unlawful sexual intercourse says: "therefore came I forth to meet thee, fervently to seek thy face, and I have found thee". "Fervently to seek thy face", i.e. thy favour. Now let us consider a linguistic argument supplied by the Qur'?n itself. An example of a colloquial phrase found in it that aptly explains an anthropomorphic phrase elsewhere in the Holy Book is in (Q. XVII, 29) the commandment directed to the believers: "And keep not thy hand fettered (like a niggard) to thy neck, nor stretch it out widespread altogether", that is to say: be neither niggardly nor profuse, but observe the mean between the two extremes, wherein consists true liberality. Exactly the same symbo lic language is used in (Q. V, 67) with regard to God's hands. The Jews say: 'God's hand is fettered'. Fettered are their hands, and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay, but His hands are outstretched. Al-Zamakhshar? (d. 1144), the well-known Mu*tazilite Qur'?n exegete, simply states that yadu 9?H?ki magh?Wktun is an expression for niggardliness.lh Of more importance for the subject matter of our discussion, however, is the evidence that commentators whom the Muslims themselves hold to be orthodox also apparently do not feel any scruple in resorting to ta'vM when confronted with this Qur'?nic verse. al-Bay?l?w? (d. 1286) who, as a rule, is keen on amending Mu'tazilite views of al-Zamakhshar? explains: The fettering of a hand and its being outspread is a metaphor for niggardliness and liberality.15</page><page sequence="7">Islamic Studies, 27:2 (1988) 125 al-]abar? (d. 923), whose commentary is virtually an encyclopedia of traditions handed down from first and second generation scholars of Islam concerning the interpretation of Qur'?nic passages, reproduces in his comment of this verse a dispute in which some claim that the hand of God is an expression for His grace, some others say that His hand represents His power, and again another group regards it as a reference to His ownership.16 In the Egyptian al- Man?A commentary, which is practically orthodox, Rash?d Ri(J? (d. 1935) refers to Ibn 'Abbas (d. 686), whom he calls the great authority of Qur'?nic interpretation, for the ancestors as well as the later generations. According to the Egyptian exegete, the latter's statements warrant him to conclude that God's outspread, hands symbolize His great munificence.17 If, however, we appear to be enabled to adopt in our argumentation the maxim that the best elucidation of the Qur'?n is to be expected from the Qur'?n itself, we possess the strongest evidence for the justification of a metaphorical interpretation of the anthropomorphisms. In this connection, we should focus our attention on the Qur'?nic anthropomorphic locution: ibtigh?' wajhi flMhi9 desiring fervently the face of God. Verses in the Qur'?n where the phrase is met are as follows: ... And whatever good you give away benefits your own souls, for then you are giving away, desiring fervently the face of God (II: 272); Do not drive away (said to Muhammad) those (i.e. the poor followers whose expulsion was made a condition by some leading Qurayshites, if they were to join Muhammad) who call upon their Lord in the morning and evening, desiring fervently His face (VI:52); And they who persevere desiring fervently the face of their Lord... ? their shall be the Ultimate Abode (Paradise) (X1I1:22); So give what is due to your fellow-creature, the needy and the traveller; that is the best for those who desire fervently God's face... : and what of alms you give away desiring fervently God's face, you will get back twice the amount (XXX:38 f.) In all these texts the fervent desire to secure the face of God proves to render a powerful motivation for perseverence in the course of hardships and persecution, for giving alms and doing other good works. What could this mean and what does the face of God intimate in the context given? The answer is supplied by the Qur'?n itself, for in parallel passages the expression IbUqha9 wajlii 9llAhi has been substituted by ibtigh?9 lidwani 9ll?hi (desiring fervently the favour of God, LV1I:27), by ibtigh?9 Kahmat?n min Kabbika (seeking mercy from thy Lord, XV1I-.28), and by ibtigh?9</page><page sequence="8">126 Islamic Studies, 27:2 M988) ma/iddtl 9WihL (desiring fervently the good pleasure of God, 11:207 and 265). Thus we read in the Qur'?n (11:265): "And they who give away from their possessions out of a fervent desire to please God [?bt?Qh?' maid?ii 'Wahl). (Compare this with the above quoted 11:272). For scholars of the Old Testament it is a well-known issue that the face of God often possesses the surplus value of the benevotzvit face of God. In a most imaginative way this is indicated in Genesis XXXIII, verse 10, where Jacob says to his brother Esau: "If now I have found grace in your sight, then receive the present from my hand; for 1 have discovered the same expression in your face as in the countenance of God, and you were pleased with me". In this Holy Book seven times is spoken of searching for (?afeo?) the panez Jahwe, the face of Jahw^ which is favourably turned towards men. In 2 Chronicles VII, verse 14, the Lord says unto Solomon: "If my people... shall humble themselves, pray, seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin". Now that we can establish that not only common parlance but also the Qur'?n itself justifies the application of ta'ttil, we have to stipulate simultaneously that the metaphorical interpreta tion as such ought to be consistent with the context of the phrase that is given a figurative sense. No particular dogmatic preference of the interpreter should enter* into it. The Im?mite19 Sharif al-Murta4? al-Hud? (d. 1044), who studied under several non Shi* ite scholars among whom the notorious Mu4tazilite 4Abd al-Jabb?r, thinks it unworthy of God's honour that He chose Abraham as a friend. Khaflil in Q. IV: 125 has to be taken in a different sense. To this end al-Murtad? quotes a verse of the pre Islamic poet Zubayr in which khaM. conveys the meaning of 4 a needy person'.19 Although this interpretation may be based on sound philological grounds, it is clearly a distortion of the sense khaSL has in view of the immediate context in which the religion (rruJ ah) of Abraham is set off as a pattern to be followed by Muslims. On the other hand, to my mind the interpretative method used by the Mu4tazilite al-Zamakhshar? in this case is allowable. "Friend", so he argues, "is a trope indicative of Abraham's election and his being favoured with esteem."20 The permissibility of a metaphorical interpretation within proper limits has the additional advantage that in this way the Qur'?nic anthropomorphisms impart a specific aesthetic delight to the reader. They need no longer be accepted as necessary concomitants to an insufficient capacity in man's faculty of abstracting so that he is compelled to form notions about divine attributes which are derived from his own imagination and deduced from the creation around him. On the contrary, anthropomorphisms</page><page sequence="9">Islamic Studies, 27:2 (1988) 127 might produce a poetical ring and may enhance the expressiveness and rhetorical power of (^?r'?nic diction. The Qur'?n (Vll:54) says about God: "His is the creation and the preservation of the universe (am*)"21. This is the definition of a principle, an abstract truth. Much more suggestive, however, is the poetical wording of the same idea in anthropomorphic terms, as is clone in Q. X:3 where it is described how God after the creation of the heavens and the earth in six days ascends His throne "to arrange the ami", i.e. to plan His government. The throne, al-BaycJ?w? comments, is a tamtkH, a typification of God's majesty.22 Rash?d Ri(J? endorses this state ment, declaring that the pictorial representation of the Lord's sitting Himself on the throne lends vigour and depth to the abstract truth that heavens and earth are under His authority.25 Indeed, the most essential function of the anthropomorphisms in the Qur'?n is to lend vigour and depth to the various aspects of its message.
