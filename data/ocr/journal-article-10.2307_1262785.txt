For more than a half century ethnog- raphers among the Pueblo Indians of Ari- zona and New Mexico have been in the habit of calling certain classes of words archaic. Words that are unintelligible to the natives who use them, certain words which the ethnographer cannot translate, poetic expressions, one of two words having the same meaning and which is not in com- mon use,-these, and perhaps other classes of words and phrases, are commonly called archaic. It is the thesis of this article that in most cases this interpretation is quite unwarranted, and that, in instances where it might be justifiable, merely to brand the words archaic would be-to obscure or con- ceal a phenomenon of vital importance in Pueblo life: a special vocabulary of cere- monial terms. The belief that the Pueblo Indians have preserved certain words from the remote past and continue to use them today despite the fact that they no longer know the meanings of these words, is fairly common among ethnographers. Thus Bandelier speaks of "the positively established fact of the exist- ence of archaic terms which the Pueblo Indian uses without knowing any longer their signification."1 In rendering Hopi 1 Ad. F. Bandelier, Final Report of Investiga- tions among the Indians of the Southwestern United States, Part I, Papers of the Archaeological Institute of America, American Series III, p. 262; Cambridge, 1890. songs into English Voth frequently en- counters words which he cannot translate. He therefore calls them "archaic; meaning unknown."2 Cushing contrasts archaic names for the cardinal points at Zuni with modern terms, and refers to a myth "filled with archaic expressions nowhere to be found in modern Zuni."3 Stirling, speaking of a version of the origin myth at Acoma, says that it was "couched in archaic lan- guage so that in many places the younger interpreters were unable to translate and the elderly informant would have to explain in modern Acoma phraseology."4 If it were an established fact that the Pueblo Indians of today use ancient words in their own respective languages whose meanings have been forgotten, we would have an interesting problem before us: Why have they done this? Why would they con- tinue to use the empty shells of words after the living kernels of meaning had died with- in them? Is such a thing possible? No Pueblo ethnologist, so far as we know, has raised such questions as this and attempted to answer them. But before undertaking an explanation of these alleged cases of semantic amnesia we must inquire if they are indeed archaisms as claimed or whether they are phenomena of a different kind. With one exception so far as we know, none of the ethnographers who claim that certain words are archaic has attempted to substantiate his claim with evidence. Bun- zel has undertaken to show that kacima tapela is indeed an archaic expression in 2 H. R.

They merely declare that such and such word is archaic. But can one tell that a word is archaic merely by looking at it? Many so-called archaic words are not archaic at all but words borrowed from a foreign language. The Pueblo Indians fre- quently borrow each other's songs and occa- sionally, at least, each other's prayers. It thus happens that an informant may be quite unable to translate a song or prayer that he knows by heart. Or, it might be only a word or a phrase that defies transla- tion. Cushing and Voth were well aware of this pueblo custom of borrowing from a foreign tongue, yet when each encounters words which he cannot translate he calls them archaic. One of the songs of the Oraibi powamu ceremony, according to Voth (p. 136), IS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF ARCHAIC WORDS. It is much more likely that it is sung in a language foreign to the Hopi. As a matter of fact one of the words, hanati, is in all probability the Keresan word for clouds (henati). Other words look Keresan, also: tama may be kama house; muuta may be modi youth or boy. In another song Voth says that the word "iola is an archaic word. It very likely means corn ear. One priest said that he had heard it meant mother," (p. 133). Iola is probably the Keresan iariko; I and r are frequently interchanged, and iariko is the Keresan name of the corn ear fetich, or mother. Other words in Hopi songs, e.g. nayawuna, wawuna, shaatcina, etc., which Voth calls archaic, are probably Keresan words also.6 At Zuni according to Cushing: "In the prayer-songs of the Saniakiakwe, 6 Ruth L. Bunzel, Zuni Ritual Poetry, BAE-R 47.620, 717, n. 61; Washington, 1932. 6 See glossary of Keresan terms in L. A. White, The Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico, Memoir 60.15-21, American Anthropological Association; Menasha, Wisc., 1942. the names of all these prey gods are, with two exceptions, given in the language of the Rio Grande Indians. This is probably one of the many devices for securing greater secrecy, and rendering the ceremonials of the Hunter Society mysterious to other than members. The exceptions are, the Coyote... known by the archaic name of Thlakiatchu, instead of by its ordinary name, of Suski, and the Prey Mole, or god of the Lower regions, which is named Mai- tupu, also archaic, instead of Kialutsi."7 But maitupu also is a word "in the lan- guage of the Rio Grande Indians:" we have identified it repeatedly as maidyupi shrew (Sorex) among the Keres.8 Thus we see that many of the words and phrases commonly called archaic are not archaic at all but terms taken over from a foreign tongue. In his Keresan Texts Boas9 states that ocara (sun) is the old form of ocatc. We can see no reason, and Boas does not offer one, for regarding one of these words as the old form of the other. The Keres very often change the pronunciation of a word to adapt it to musical or ritual expression. The writer has often witnessed this. Mrs. Stevenson has called attention to the prac- tice also: "The Sia sometimes adopt the poet's license in their songs and alter a word; for example, the name for 'badger' is tuopi, but is changed in the skoyo song... to tupina, because, they say, the latter word renders the stanza more rhythmical."'0 Ocara is undoubtedly merely an example of such poetic license. To turn to another example: Parsons tells us that here in the light, a phrase in a Hopi prayer, is "an archaic way of saying in this 7 Op. cit., p. 20. 8 L. A. White, The Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico, Memoir 43, 203. American Anthro- pological Association; 1935. 9 AES-P 8.1.xii. 10 M. C. Stevenson, The Sia, BAE-R 11.123; Washington, 1894. 162 VOL.

Thus smoke often means mist, plumes may mean clouds, etc. Certain figures of speech are employed in speaking of the bear. One says "I husked the corn" instead of "I skinned the bear"; "I eat'roast corn" instead of "I eat bear meat," etc.l2 There are countless examples of expressions of this and similar kinds among the pueblos. But we can see no valid reason for calling them archaisms; they are simply metaphors or circumlocutions. Ethnographers among the pueblos occa- sionally discover that there are two words for the same thing-two words for dove, kiva, to dance, etc. One of these words, he finds, is employed in ordinary discourse; the other appears to be used less frequently and then in special situations only. The ethnog- rapher frequently accounts for this by say- ing that the word less commonly used is archaic. Thus Stevenson speaks of an archaic word for ceremonial chamber,13 and archaic words for man and woman.14 We have already noted Cushing's examples of archaisms. The present writer once called 11 E. C. Parsons, Pueblo Indian Religion, 2 vols. p. 314, fn. ?; Chicago, 1939. 12 White, The Pueblo of Santa Ana, p. 315. 13 Op. cit., p. 78. 14 Manuscript No. 503, Bureau of American Ethnology. one of two words for white at Acoma archaic.15 It is true, of course, that archaic words like sup or quoth in English, for example, are not employed in ordinary discourse but appear only in certain contexts. But it does not follow that words not commonly employed in ordinary discourse, or used only in special situations, are necessarily archaic. Many ethnographers have appar- ently fallen into this fallacy. We would not declare flatly that these special words are NOT archaic. To do so without supporting evidence would be as unwarranted as the unsupported claim that they are. It may be that some, or even all, of these special terms are archaic. But, to think of them as archaisms only is to over- look a fact of prime importance in Pueblo life: these special words are first and fore- most ceremonial terms. We have discovered at the Pueblo of Santa Ana a well defined ceremonial vocabu- lary. It consists of words which are used only on ceremonial occasions, in ritual con- texts. These words are the exact semantic equivalent of words employed in ordinary discourse. Thus when speaking of the Mountain bluebird in ordinary discourse one says coroya. But in ritual contexts one always says sto-c. There are many words and phrases of this sort as the following list shows; and our list is probably far from complete. 16 Stirling, op. cit., p. 14, fn. 21. 2.

Notes on the above terms (1) This is the Mountain bluebird, Sialia currucoides. (2) Naiya means mother; svtranaiya our mother. No translation for G'a'co could be obtained, but it was said that svtranaiya G'a'co refers to our mother latik. (3) Gyami means eagle; ha'pi feather. No translation was obtained for Gyinyiya'me. (4) One informant said that one might say catcawatsiDya'nye' instead of posikome'. (5) The gowatcanyi are the helpers of the Pueblo War captains. Tsamahiya is the name of one of the war gods. It is also applied to other things (cf. White, The Pueblo of Santa Ana, p. 306). (6) The Koshairi are also called Pai'yatyama in ceremonial contexts. (7) This word is frequently found in migration myths; it has sometimes been mistaken for a proper name. (8) The anthropomorphic rain gods, the katsina, are also called ci'wana (shiwana). (9) This term occurs frequently in prayers which might suggest that it is a ceremonial term rather than a common word. (10) Naback po'tca is said to mean let it snow or may it snow. But naback is the name of the white cotton robe or blanket worn by women on ceremonial occasions. This would suggest that the phrase might mean, literally, Let a white blanket [of snow] cover [the earth]. (11) This word resembles kastotco'ma, the long decorated pole carried in dances for the patron saints of the pueblos. The similarity of terms may be due to the similarity of the objects designated: both are staffs, although different in size, dress, and function. (12) H'a-mi is the common term for tobacco; no translation could be secured for pai'ats. 164 VOL. X</page><page sequence="5">CEREMONIAL VOCABULARY AMONG THE PUEBLOS (13) Tsina means turkey; ha-pi feather. Ho-senyi means woool or hair; the wool of sheep is called ho'senyi. (14) G'awaweima means holy or sacred; G'ai'kame water. The informant said that holy water in the Roman Catholic church could be called DoDatc G'ai'kame. DoDatc is the Keresan name for a Catholic priest; its etymology is unknown. (15) Phrases like this are employed in ceremonies in such situations as dismissing a helper, or the hano sicti (common people), at the conclusion of a ceremony. 4. After obtaining the above vocabulary at Santa Ana the writer did some work on this subject at the Keresan pueblo of Sia. In addition to duplicating some of the data from Santa Ana, the following ceremonial terms were noted: Be'witsa is the ritual word at Sia for food; ope'wi, the ordinary word. In ceremonial contexts the crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) is called makaiye hatctse. Hatctse means old man; no English equiva- lent was obtained for makaiye; it may be a proper name. In ordinary discourse the crow is called stci"ra at Sia, as it is at Santo Domingo.l6 5. If there is any general principle which determines whether or not a thing shall have two designations, a ceremonial term and a common term, we could not discover it. A principle readily suggests itself, to be sure: Those things which are essential, or promi- nent, in ceremonies or in sacred mythology shall have special ceremonial terms. This is a plausible principle, but it does not fit our facts. Thus we have ceremonial terms for rain and lightning but none for clouds, fog, mist, thunder, or rainbow. Clouds cer- tainly seem to be as important in myth and ritual as lightning. It is curious that we should have a ceremonial term for the Moun- tain bluebird (about which we know nothing else) and no ceremonial term for owl, parrot, and roadrunner who (or, whose feathers) are quite prominent ritually. Our inform- ant declared that there are no ceremonial terms for sun, moon, and stars, which seems strange considering their importance, the sun and moon especially, in Pueblo religion. The puma, badger, coyote, shrew, etc., are 16 White, The Pueblo of Santo Domingo, p. 204. important spirits but we have no ceremonial terms for any mammals at all. Neither did we secure one for snake. It is curious that we should have a ceremonial term for beads but none for turquoise; odd that we should have a ceremonial term for willow but none for spruce which is used so much in sacred dances and in prayerstick making. It is not entirely clear why beads, clothing, buck- skin, and eat, should have special cere- monial terms, although we note that gifts of these things and food are frequently made to spirits in myth and ritual. The reasons for the existence of cere- monial terms for other things in our list are fairly clear: water, lightning, snow, and rain are of paramount importance in prayer and ritual. Tobacco, corn meal, cigarettes, staffs of office, and feathers are prominent in ritual. The "road" is the path of sacred corn meal over which men and gods walk on certain occasions. Koshairi, gowatcanyi, men and women are spirits. Mountains are important land marks on the mythologic landscape. Houses have a religious sig- nificance. Many of the important gods are said to live in houses; there is a house at each of the four corners of the earth.17 Ladders too are important ritually. It is significant to note that in many of the quotations cited earlier in this paper, the ceremonial character of the so-called archaic words is expressed or implied. Thus Par- sons says that "at Zuni archaic terms for lreationship are used in smoking ritual."'8 17 White, The Pueblo of Santa Ana, p. 80; Fig. 5, p. 81. 18 E. C. Parsons, Laguna Genealogies, Anthro- pological Papers, American Museum of Natural History, Vol. XIX, Pt. V p. 148; New York, 1923. NO. 4 165</page><page sequence="6">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS White observes that the archaic word for white at Acoma is "used only cere- monially."l9 The archaisms cited for Zuni by Cushing appear in "prayer-songs" and in myths. The archaic language of Acoma is found in the sacred origin myth.20 Steven- son finds an archaic word for ceremonial chamber. Thus the ceremonial character of these special terms is clearly indicated in some statements and suggested in others. But ethnographers, dominated by the con- cept of the archaic, have failed to realize that they were confronted by a special cere- monial vocabulary, or have failed to appre- ciate that fact. 6. In view of the foregoing it is a bit sur- prising to learn that the existence of a special ceremonial vocabulary among the Pueblos was discovered and recognized forty years ago. In 1903, the late Dr. Ale? Hrdlicka published a brief note on A Laguna Cere- monial Language, in the American An- thropologist.21 An "especially well educated and trustworthy" Laguna Indian told Dr. Hrdlicka that "some of the old men of La- guna know and still use in certain cere- monies an archaic language which the younger generation can neither speak nor, fully understand... this ceremonial lan- guage is known as Hamasija, which accord- ing to... [the informant], means, approxi- mately 'old', 'ancient'." Dr. Hrdlicka lists some thirty words in this "old" language together with their equivalents in "present Laguna." Here again we note that cere- monial words are called archaic. 7. There has been some casual and inci- dental recognition of a ceremonial vocabu- lary among the pueblos. Thus, in a foot- note in Pueblo Indian Religion,22 Parsons alludes to a "ritual vocabulary as among the Keres." And in her Isleta, New Mexico, again in a footnote, she notes that "Leachi 19 Stirling, op. cit., p. 14, fn. 21. 20 Stirling, op. cit., p. vii. 21 Vol. 5, pp. 730-32. 22 P. 312; see, also, p. 623. is the ceremonial term for rain, lurto, the vernacular."23 Curtis speaks of "ceremonial color terms" at Zuni.24 But, on the whole, Hrdli6ka's discovery has gone unnoticed,25 and nowhere, except in his brief note, have we found a clear recognition and an ade- quate appreciation of this important Pueblo trait. We have cited evidence indicating the presence of a special ritual vocabulary at Hopi, Zuni and among the Keres. We have no data at hand on this point for the Tewa, Tigua and Jemez, but it would be reasonable to expect to find it among these pueblos as well. To refer once more to the possible archaic character of these ceremonial words: We noted that Hrdlicka's informant spoke of them as constituting an "old language." Informants have a tendency to attribute great age to many things that they do not understand well, or to things that are very sacred. Their excuse sometimes for not being able to explain some words properly is that the words are "very old." But the Indian's conception of antiquity is often faulty. Horses, cattle and sheep are often mentioned in origin myths. A Hopi once told the writer how two bronze bells in his custody had been brought up from the womb of the earth when the people first came out. And he customarily explained political events of the past decade by tracing their antecedent causes to "the beginning." We cannot simply take the Indian's word for it in matters of this sort. It is well known that many things-art forms, verbal formulas, articles of para- phernalia, patterns of behavior, etc.-im- bedded in sacred contexts often tend to persevere without change for a very long 23 E. C. Parsons, Isleta, New Mexico, BAE-R 47.330; Washington, 1932. 24 E. S. Curtis, The North American Indian, Vol. XVII. 206; New York, 1926. 25 I did not learn of Hrdlicka's article until after I had discovered the ceremonial vocabulary at Santa Ana myself. 166 VOL. X</page><page sequence="7">CEREMONIAL VOCABULARY AMONG THE PUEBLOS time. Thus sacred words might become archaic because they are sacred. But we cannot rely wholly on this reasoning here. We have no reason to believe that to eat is more sacred than to drink, yet we have a ceremonial expression for the former but not for the latter. Game animals, for which we have no ceremonial term, are certainly as sacred in Pueblo religion, we believe, as domesticated animals, for which we have a ceremonial term. Neither can the mere fact that ceremonial terms are restricted to certain situations and personnel be adduced to prove their archaic character. Neutron, penicillin, and societal are restricted in use in our society, but they are not archaic; quite the contrary. We do not wish to declare that words and phrases in the Pueblo ceremonial vocabulary are not and cannot be archaic. Some, or perhaps even all, may be. But no one should accept them as archaisms without evidence, and, so far, this has not been supplied. Secondly, it should be noted, there may be many archaic words in the language that have no special ceremonial significance. Thirdly, and finally, granting that some or all of them are archaic, we should not allow this characteristic to ob- scure or conceal a fact of much greater ethnological importance: their special func- tion as ceremonial terms. As ceremonial terms these words are just as modern, just as meaningful and significant, just as vital and indispensable as any other class of words in Pueblo culture. Daily and yearly life could not be carried on without them. 8. Summary and conclusions: The com- mon tendency to call exceptional words among the pueblos archaic is, for the most part, unwarranted. Many of these words are not archaic at all, but are (a) foreign loan words, (b) words whose pronunciation has been changed for reasons of euphony or rhythm in song or prayer, or (c) metaphors or other poetical expressions. There are many instances in which two synonymous words exist for the same thing. One of these words is used only in ceremonial con- texts, the other is employed in ordinary dis- course. The aggregation of words restricted to ritual use constitutes a special ceremonial vocabulary, a vital instrument in the re- ligious and ceremonial life of the pueblos. These ceremonial words may also be archaic, or they may not; we have no definitive evi- dence on either side. But, archaic or not, their chief significance lies not in their antiquity, but in their vitally important ceremonial character and function. NO. 4 167</page></plain_text>
