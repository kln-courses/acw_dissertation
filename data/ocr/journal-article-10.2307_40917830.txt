<plain_text><page sequence="1">PER OLOF SUNDMAN AND THE FRENCH NEW NO VELr- INFLUENCE OR COINCIDENCE? Lars G. Warme University of Washington TpiROM the very beginning critics had some difficulty placing Per J^ Olof Sundman. When he appeared on the literary scene in 1957, he was immediately recognized as a writer with a style and stature distinctly his own. The seemingly simple and straightforward prose of brief, affirmative sentences, the extreme economy of expression, the unadorned concentration of style and the terse, laconic dialogue were reminiscent of the Icelandic saga and of Par Lagerkvist's Cubism. But there was also an astonishing precision and accuracy of observation with an unhurried accumulation of facts and details of indisputable au- thenticity that lent weight and immediacy to objects and characters. With subsequent books Sundman consolidated his position and in a number of articles and interviews he offered comments on his particular technique and defended himself against charges of being a theoretician of the novel. Thus he writes in 1963: "Jag tror inte jag hâller mig med nâgot sa exklusivt som en romanteori. I mitt fall rör det sig snarare om en mycket enkel teknik att berätta, en sorts enkel litterär metod."1 In the same year, 1963, Alain Robbe-Grillet published his collection of literary essays under the title Pour un nouveau roman (English trans- lation For a New Novel, 1965). In the opening essay, "The Uses of Theory," Robbe-Grillet too begins with an emphatic "I am not a theoretician of the novel." Despite the author's protestations, For a New Novel became the work that best summed up the aims and methods of the new generation of French writers who - for all their differences in temperament and style - had a common point of departure in their re- jection of many of the established views on what a novel should be. Robbe-Grillet's own novel The Erasers of 1953 had marked the be- ginning. Critics soon began to spot kindred souls and to group them together into a "school" although they were at a loss as to what it should be called. Sartre suggested anti-novel, and Emile Henriot, noting the predominance of visual observations in the descriptions of these novels, dubbed it V école du regard. Then, finally, in 1958, the neutral term nouveau roman was introduced and adopted as a convenient label, 403</page><page sequence="2">404 Scandinavian Studies even by the proponents themselves, among whom Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, Natalie Sarraute, Claude Simon, and Marguerite Durras were in the vanguard. Robbe-Grillet's For a New Novel offered striking similarities with Sundman's views on fiction. Perceptive Swedish critics had already noted the many points of correspondence with the French writers, but now the association seemed firmly established. Subsequent translations into French of Sundman's works, most notably his Expeditionen and the enthusiastic reception it received {Le Monde's literary page pro- claimed "a renewal of the Swedish novel") seemed to link Sundman even more closely with the French new novel.2 The French writers themselves saw in Sundman notre frère, notre semblable and Michel Butor wrote a preface to L'Expédition lavish in praise and admiration. This preface was later reprinted in BLM? With some relief, we may assume, the critics had finally found a label for Sundman as a Hyper- borean offshoot of the nouveau roman. To Sundman himself the association seems to have been a source of some irritation. In an interview in 1971 he states categorically, "Early in my career I was compared with the nouveau roman, particularly with Robbe-Grillet. That was before I read them and actually I haven't been able to read them carefully after that."4 There is no reason to doubt Sundman's words; indeed, many of his own comments on his method of writing had appeared a few years before the theories of the nouveau roman were made readily accessible under one cover in Robbe-Grillet's collection of essays in 1963; before that, the essays had been published in newspapers and periodicals over a period of some ten years. Sundman's approach to fiction - what he referred to as his "very simple narrative technique" - is all the more interesting for having been arrived at independently. The curious co- incidence could support the suggestion that new literary conventions reflect fundamental and general changes of a social, technological, or philosophical nature, resulting in a different way of perceiving reality; similarities between contemporary writers should then be viewed in terms of identical responses to common phenomena rather than in terms of direct influences or emulations. The observation contains a caution against the often insiduous and too facile attribution of "in- fluences" that literary historians are guilty of. In the following I would like to point out some of the fundamental similarities between Sundman and the writers of the nouveau roman,</page><page sequence="3">SUNDMAN AND THE FRENCH NEW NOVEL 405 but also some equally fundamental differences. Finally I would like to suggest the different paths by which Sundman and his French con- temporaries happened to coincide in their views on fiction. Common to the French new novelists is their strict, self-imposed limitations in apprehending and presenting reality. Almost without exception their novels are demonstrations of a phenomenological ap- proach to reality, underlying which there is a recognition of the severe limitations facing the observer-narrator. The writers make no claims to objectivity, and the single narrative point of view is rigorously ob- served. There is nothing new in this. What is new, however, is the consistence, passion, almost fanaticism with which the method is pur- sued. Philosophically the method can be traced back to Leibnitz and his monadology according to which, in the words of Alfred Stern, "physi- cal reality is broken up into innumerable facets of individual perspec- tives, each of which is determined by the spatio-temporal circumstances of the spectator."5 This particular "perspectivism," to use Ortega y Gasset's term, was readily adopted by Existentialist philosophy, which claimed that each man is thrown or cast into existence - geworfen is Heidegger's word - and can see reality only from the angle of his spe- cific existential circumstances. He can thus only give the truth of his own existential perspective. The French new novelists have their philosophical roots in Existentialism, and Sartre was the great inter- mediary in directly applying the insights to fiction. More than Heidegger, however, it is Husserl's phenomenology that is responsible for the new novelists' particular way of apprehending reality. Husserl's dictum that the world is there before it is anything, echoed in Sartre's famous existence precedes essence, was adopted by the nouveau roman and exemplified with enthusiasm and single-minded persistence. Robbe- Grillet declares that the surface of things must no longer be thought of as a mask of reality, but as the only reality we can grasp: objects simply are there and it is improper to project ourselves into them; reality reveals itself as fragments of crude reality and the novelist must limit himself to describing, measuring, and defining objects as they appear to him. The hero of the novel becomes a recording consciousness. The narrator lodges himself inside a character and peers out at the world with a camera lens in each eye socket. The disconcerting, un- settling effect of this way of viewing the world derives from our habits of apprenhension and classification. Robbe-Grillet hopes to free us from our conventions and, in his words,</page><page sequence="4">406 Scandinavian Studies instead of this universe of "signification" (psychological, social, functional), we must try, then, to construct a world both more solid and more im- mediate. Let it be first of all by their presence that objects and gestures establish themselves, and let this presence continue to prevail over what- ever explanatory theory that may try to enclose them in a system of references, whether emotional, sociological, Freudian, or metaphysical.9 The new novelists, then, repudiate the whole tradition of the psycho- logical novel from Stendhal and Balzac to Mauriac. They have very much taken to heart Sartre's warning that in this world of relativity there is no room for any "privileged observers" with claims to omni- science. The nouveau roman traces its own ancestry along the Kafka- Joyce-Faulkner line and most directly to Sartre's La Nausée, whose hero Roquentin is the model for a number of protagonist-observers in the works of these French writers. Their phenomenological concerns have resulted in an acute and critical awareness of language as the re- pository of conventions and traditional patterns of apprehending reality. Robbe-Grillet speaks for instance of the damnable tendency of adjectives and metaphors to contaminate objects with a nonexistent interiority and anthropomorphism. Finally, the nouveau roman largely rejects the idea of literature as a vehicle for reform or criticism, Existentialist en- gagement, metaphysical speculation, etc. The works are experienced as pure demonstrations of a method, as exercises in phenomenological research. Sundman's novels also demonstrate a phenomenological approach to fiction with a consistent refusal to go beneath the surface reality of objects and characters. His method constitutes as drastic a break with the traditional psychological novel as ever the nouveau roman. It is marked by a strong drive toward reduction as reflected in his choice of narrative point of view, in his character delineations and the emphasis on visual observation. A linguistic analysis of Sundman's prose reveals a number of rigorous restrictions. In his sentence structure there is a marked preference for grammatically simple sentences or coordinated sentences joined by "och" or placed paratactically together without conjunctions. Complex sentences are rare; when they do occur, the sub- ordinate clauses are usually relative or temporal or clauses introduced by "att," whereas we rarely find examples of complex sentences denoting more involved relationships of a causal, consecutive, conditional, or concessive nature. Instead, elements are lined up like building blocks of equal weight, and it is left for the reader to place them in a meaningful combination. A very simple example will illustrate how Sundman's</page><page sequence="5">SUNDMAN AND THE FRENCH NEW NOVEL 407 phenomenology operates on the linguistic level. In the novel Skytten we read the following description: "Det rann bara helt litet vatten i forsen. Dammluckorna vid hovdet var stängda eller nästan stängda; vattnet i den övre sjön skulle sparas till högvintern."7 The logical chain of causality and finality is simple and obvious, and the reader automatically provides the connectives between the observations: the water level was low became the sluice gates were closed so that water could be saved. Why doesn't Sundman supply the connectives? Is it only a narrative mannerism, a stylistic or esthetic device to convey an impression of laconic brevity? It could further be questioned whether this brevity, this placing of "building blocks" one next to the other without the binding cement, is not to a large extent an illusory brevity. Similar questions have been raised by Hemingway critics. In Sund- man's works phenomena present themselves in opaque isolation. Each one of the observations in the passage above is irreproachably objective when taken separately. Placed together, however, they are made into a configuration through the percipient's application of logic, an opera- tion involving deductions and a series of decisions as to cause and effect. In psychological terms the result is a Gestalt, a subjective con- struction which in this particular case of water level, sluice-gates, and winter supply of water happens to be verifiably correct. However, the because and the so that were supplied by the percipient. Reality itself does not provide connectives between phenomena. The typical Sundman sentence structure thus reflects an attempt to present data as fragments of crude reality, to use Robbe-Grillet's expression, without the inter- mediary process of interpretation; the method contains a caution not to draw hasty conclusions or create false Gestalts. Conjunctions are, we discover, far from neutral: quite often they are heavily loaded with subjective interpretation. It could be argued that the juxtaposition of elements often creates traps for the readers and constitutes the writer's manipulative influence in the selection of certain data and omission of others. But isn't this precisely the danger we encounter in "real life" when accidental juxtapositions of phenomena result in false apprehen- sions of reality? The empty spaces between Sundman's sentences or clauses enlist the reader's active participation and creativity. The reading turns into an investigation and this detective element gives to Sundman's works their special dynamism: the seemingly everyday and familiar is sud- denly shown to be mysterious and enigmatic; the exploration will often</page><page sequence="6">408 Scandinavian Studies deepen the mystery, but it also offers rewards and revelations for which the reader may be tempted to take personal credit for having him- self supplied the missing connectives. Sundman himself refrains from explanations. A seemingly trivial situation from the novel Undersbk- ningen may serve as an illustration. The protagonist Erik Olofsson visits his only sister, who is considerably older than he. She is a school janitor and she serves her brother dinner in the kitchen: "Han ât av maten. Hon följde med ögonen hans sked när han tog for sig av myltan; det hade varit en dâlig hjortronsommar detta âr."8 What is the connection between these last two statements, the fact that she watched his spoon and that cloudberries had been scarce that year? Or is there any con- nection at all beyond a purely neutral association from jam to berries, an absentminded fastening of attention on the spoon and a fleeting reflection on the year's crop of cloudberries? Is there a certain anxiety in the glance - the parsimonious school janitor's fear that her brother help himself too generously to the precious jam? Or does the little gesture reveal a solicitous concern for his enjoyment, a sisterly or motherly satisfaction in providing something particularly good? Does it conceal a hope for compliments and grateful recognition of her offer- ing? We do not know and Sundman does not tell. The simple situation remains fraught with possible significance, and as readers we look for further clues that may throw light over the relationship between brother and sister. This detective element in Sundman's stories is further en- hanced by the general quest-structure of practically all his works. In this respect, too, we find a striking similarity with the nouveau roman - indeed, Michel Butor defines the novel as a quest. We may conjecture that the phenomenological approach to fiction where the protagonist proceeds without preconceived notions, constantly observing and regis- tering sense data, primarily visual data, naturally lends itself to such quest or Odyssey forms, however inconclusive or even anticlimactic these quests turn out to be in the works of both Sundman and the French novelists. So far we have seen some fundamental similarities between Sundman and the novelists of the nouveau roman, to be found primarily in their common phenomenology with its emphasis on visual observations, re- strictive use of language, and the general quest-structure of the works. But there are also significant differences, perhaps most importantly in the employment of the narrators-observers within the fiction. Most of the French writers, especially Robbe-Grillet, solicit at least on one</page><page sequence="7">SUNDMAN AND THE FRENCH NEW NOVEL 409 point a suspension of disbelief when they lodge themselves inside the mind of a character and proceed to view the world through the eyes of this character, who more often than not will gradually reveal himself as an anonymous outsider, a Samuel Beckett consciousness reduced to the absurd or a pathological observer. The result is an unsettling quality about these works, an oneiric, even nightmarish, quality which is entirely lacking in Sundman's works. Sundman's very basic con- cept of the inaccessibility of our fellow humans is applied to the observers-narrators themselves and not only to the world they observe. The inner processes of these narrators remain closed books. We are no more allowed to participate in these processes, introspection, emotions, ratiocinations, than if they were oral story tellers or TV reporters in real life and we the listeners or viewers. Michel Butor's view of the novel as research seems to find a wider application in Sundman's works than in those of the nouveau roman. Indeed, the quest structure of Sundman's works serves very specific objectives varying from work to work - an examination of the mech- anisms of violence in Tvà dagar, tvà natter, for example, a political- sociological analysis of a modern Norrland community in Skytten, or a devastating ideological critique of the late nineteenth century in Ex- peditionen and Ingenjör Andrées luftfärd. Implicit in the works of the phenomenologists, whether Sundman or the French writers, with their emphasis on a surface reality and their rejection of analogies, subjectively loaded conjunctions, metaphors, or contaminating adjectives, is a desire to establish a clear separation between the subject and the object, between observer and the observed. Sundman's refusal to deal with any inner processes or construed in- formation at all is the expression of an ideology with both social and political implications. Critical attacks from the left, for instance in Jan Stolpe's article "Innanför-utanför," quite astutely recognized that Sundman's method is far from innocent. Stolpe here tries to prove that what he considers Sundman's lack of contact with reality is ulti- mately symptomatic of the Swedish Center Party.9 Sundman himself sees his method as a means to safeguarding a high degree of autonomy and freedom not only to inanimate objects but also, and above all, to human beings. In this he reveals himself as a moralist, contrary to his French contemporaries of the nouveau roman, arid reaches conclusions that are voiced in such Existentialist works as Ich bin nicht Stiller by Max Frisch, who sees our tendency to create "graven images" of our</page><page sequence="8">410 Scandinavian Studies fellow humans as a grievous sin, images based on preconceived notions and assumptions or subjective projections that violate the freedom and growth of the individual. It remains to be suggested how Sundman, despite some significant differences, arrived at his views on fiction that in so many respects co- incide with those of the nouveau roman. In common with the French writers he shows a deep distrust of psychological reconstruction, and by his own account he early repudiated Freudian psychology. Sundman's first book Jägarna, which appeared in 1957, contains a short story, "Kontrollanten," in which the author takes issue with people's tendency to indulge in popular psychoanalysis and to draw conclusions from what may be totally irrelevant facts. In an article from the same year he criticizes the literary convention that an author should deal with con- strued information about the inner life of the soul: Kritiker har likasâ funnit det tillâtligt att kommentera det "riktiga" i mänskliga interiörskildringar, som om de för det första hade faktisk kunskap om mänskliga interiörer, som om de för det andrà battre an författaren skulle kunna veta vad som bör hända i de av författaren konstruerade interiörerna !w Sundman found himself on firmer ground with behaviorism. In an interview with Laurence Dembo he tells of his discovery of Watson and such reflexologists as Pavlov, a discovery which had the effect as of "breathing fresh air." Although he has later come to view behaviorism more critically, Sundman would still agree to being labeled a "modern behaviorist."11 As a storyteller he likes to restrict himself to people's behavior and actions: Det är naturligt for mig. Jag ser vad de gör, jag hör vad de säger, jag ser ansiktenas minspel och fingrarnas rörelser. Om detta kan jag berätta. Därutöver vet jag ingenting - spekulationer i "inre förlopp", känslor, vilja och orsaker mäste forbii spekulationer. Jag tycker mig ocksâ ha funnit att dessa "inre förlopp" är helt onödiga, de kan inte föra berättandet vidare, de kan inte - hur skönt de an formuleras - lägga ens ett uns till berättelsens vikt.u Sundman's admiration for Iceland, its scenery, people, and culture, is common knowledge. His prose style with its cultivation of the art of reduction owes much to the Icelandic sagas. A good case could be made that the old Icelanders, these past masters of artistic economy, were really accomplished behaviorists in their particular way of letting char- acters reveal themselves directly without speculations about their deeper</page><page sequence="9">SUNDMAN AND THE FRENCH NEW NOVEL 411 motives or feelings. Indeed, the chapter "Style and Character Delinea- tion" in Peter Hallberg's The Icelandic Saga could to a large extent be read as a description of Per Olof Sundman's narrative technique. Thus Hallberg observes regarding the sagas that "one records observable reactions instead of making psychological analyses. Dialogue, pref- erably carried out in short utterances and cutting repartee, plays an important role." And again: "The saga writer shuns all effusive ex- pression; indeed he favors various striking forms of litotes, or under- statement." The narrator leaves it to the hearer or reader to draw conclusions from the facts as stated. This very manner of presentation in the form of neutral report naturally strengthens to a high degree the impression that one here has to do with an authentic series of events." Rather than speak of "influences" we would perhaps be better ad- vised to use terms such as "temperamental affinities" in accounting for the significant part played by behaviorism and the Icelandic sagas in Sundman's works. The same is undoubtedly true in the matter of a third and, as far as I know, largely overlooked inspiration behind Sund- man's fiction, namely Frans G. Bengtsson. In Leif Sjöberg's article "Per Olof Sundman and the Uses of Reality" Sundman is quoted as listing Frans G. Bengtsson among his literary favorites.14 It has been pointed out that the portrait that emerges of the leader of the polar ex- pedition in Ingen jör Andrées lujtjärd bears a striking resemblance with the critical appraisal of the man presented in Bengtsson 's essay of 1931 called "Andréedramat."15 In Bengtsson's works, especially in his essays, Sundman must have found confirmation for many of his own views on fiction. Both writers share an enthusiasm for the Icelandic sagas. In his essay of 1948, "Hur Rode Orm blev till" Bengtsson refers to his refusal to deal with psykologisk analys and to enter dolda medvetenhets- processer of his characters;16 in "Kommentarer kring en teknik" Sund- man writes, "jag ägnar mig inte ât psykologiserande konstruktioner av 'inre förlopp' hos mina diktade människor." In 1922 Bengtsson wrote an amusing essay entitled "Konsten att ljuga" (ibid.) in which he gives some advice on how to make a tall story credible by including details that are totally irrelevant but of unquestioned veracity; in his 195 7 article "Att berätta" Sundman mentions the same "knep när det gäller att fâ en fullständigt otrolig historia att lata füllt häradsrättsmässigt trovärdig." To return once more to the question of Sundman and the nouveau</page><page sequence="10">412 Scandinavian Studies roman, we can safely support his own claim that this "school" has not served as a model for his fiction. Nor is there any evidence that Sund- man arrived at his own "simple literary method" and his phenomeno- logical tenets by the same route as his French contemporaries, namely from HusserFs phenomenology and its more or less deliberate or acci- dental exemplifications in the works of Kafka, Joyce, Faulkner and, in particular, Sartre. The indirect influence of these sources by way of gen- eral and pervasive changes brought about in the total twentieth-century climate and in our sensibilities cannot be proved but should not be entirely disregarded. We are, however, on considerably firmer ground when tracing Sundman's method back to such inspirations as the Ice- landic sagas, Watson's behaviorism, and Frans G. Bengtsson's thoughts on fiction. These precedents, as well as those behind the French writers, seem to confirm the saying that nothing - not even the nouveau roman - is really new under the sun. What is new is the stamp of genius that the individual writer, whether a Sundman or a Robbe-Grillet, puts on his work to make it unmistakably his own. 1Per Olof Sundman, "Kommentarer kring en teknik," Bonniers Litterära Magasin 32 (1963): 231-34. 2 Marcel Brion, de l'Académie française, "Le renouveau de la littérature suédoise," Le Monde (29 May 1965), p. 13.
