<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Splitting of Skanda: Distancing and Assimilation Narratives in the Mah?bh?rata and Ayurvedic Sources Richard Mann Carleton University INTRODUCTION The Hindu narrative tradition is full of stories that involve a splitting of a god or goddess to form a new entity. At times these accounts become a formalized aspect of a sect's theology, as may be the case with Vaisnavite vy?ha and avat?ra theories; at other times the splitting narrative does not lead to philosophical speculation and remains an implicit message as to how the divine is perceived and how the personality of the divine developed over time.l This paper studies narratives about Skanda from epic and ayurvedic sources that involve a splitting of the deity to form another being.2 By "splitting" I mean both an actual physical splitting of Skanda to form a new being or beings, and splitting in the broader sense of the division of Skanda's duties and the appearance of different forms of Skanda.3 These nar ratives have not generally led to extensive interpretation by the tradition itself, but they do suggest significant shifts in certain aspects of the tradition. I argue that these narratives illus trate two underlying processes: distancing and assimilation. Some of the narratives attempt to distance Skanda from disease causation. In such accounts a being is split from Skanda to form a separate entity linked to disease; these new beings are, in effect, pathogens. I argue that disease causation was once within the purview of Skanda himself, and that these splitting narratives were designed to separate him physically, and in some cases morally, from the causes of disease. Other splitting narratives attempt to assimilate Skanda with entities similar to him, by suggesting that he and these beings are not really separate figures, but are simply forms of Skanda. The deciding factor between a splitting narrative of distancing and one of assimilation is disease causation. Where the effects of disease are a concern, the splitting narrative tends towards distancing. Where Skanda has been sanitized and is no longer closely associated with disease, the splitting narrative gravitates towards assimilation. Phyllis Granoff has argued for what she calls "narrative distancing" in some Saivite nar ratives.4 In the pur?nic narratives that she examines, Siva does not act himself, but either creates or summons another entity to act in his stead. In the early Skanda Pur?na account of the slaying of Andhaka, for instance, Siva does not battle Andhaka himself; Nandin, his I wish to thank Phyllis Granoff, Andre Couture, Patricia Dold, and Kevin Vose for their comments on various drafts of this article. 1. Vy?ha theory is associated with an early group of N?r?yana devotees called the P?ncar?tra. For more on this group and vy?ha theory, see Schrader, Introduction to the P?ncar?tra, and Neeval, Y?muna's Ved?nta and P?ncar?tra. 2. Ths paper limits itself to the northern Sanskrit tradition and does not engage the extensive Tamil tradition of Murukan, a complex topic that I intend to treat elsewhere. 3. The topic of splitting has also been dealt with by Doniger (Splitting the Difference), who primarily addresses splitting in relation to gender in Hindu and Greek myths. 4. Granoff, "Siva and His Ganas," forthcoming. I am grateful to Phyllis Granoff for sharing a pre-print with me.

The ganas and other beings created by Siva in effect act as his body in the three worlds. Granoff argues that many of these narratives of distancing began as stories of other gods and ganas that the Saivite tradition appropriated as it spread, absorbing local traditions and narratives. Hence, these stories may be simul taneously viewed as narratives that physically distance Siva from violent acts and as evi dence for the historian about the formation of Saivism and the assimilation of local cults. The narratives about Skanda that I examine here follow a similar track in that they distance the deity from acting in a certain manner, and they also function to assimilate various other figures into Skanda's cult. While these two Saivite narrative traditions, that of Siva and that of Skanda, are clearly related, there are some significant differences in the material on Skanda that this paper will explore. If the pur?nic stories of Siva are designed to separate the deity from direct physical action, the epic and ayurvedic stories of Skanda differ in that in these stories Skanda does act. The Skanda distancing narratives do not distance him from action or from taking an anthropo morphic form; instead they distance him from certain types of action and certain aspects of his characterization. I will propose that these splitting narratives are about Skanda's trans formation and absorption into the "orthodox" pantheon.6 In their approach to the Skanda narratives the epic poets display an anxiety about this deity's connection to disease and about the potential blame that may fall on him because of this connection. The transformations he undergoes in these stories separate him from the causes of disease. We can trace the gradual process of this physical and moral separation. While the earlier epic and ayurvedic narra tives only hint at a moral distancing for Skanda, the later ayurvedic accounts elaborate on this point. Through these narratives we can follow the process of Skanda's assimilation into the orthodox tradition: first, his character is redefined and distanced from more ambivalent rep resentations of him, and, second, related figures and cults are drawn into this now "orthodox" figure. I will discuss five narratives of physical splitting related to Skanda from the Mah? bh?rata, and then I will explore these themes as they are found in early ayurvedic sources that have a particular interest in disease causation and the links this god has to pathogens. 1. THE FOUR SPLITTING NARRATIVES IN THE SKANDA EPISODE OF THE ?RANYAKAPARVAN There are three birth stories for Skanda in the Mah?bh?rata (3.207-21; 9.43-45; 13.83 86) and a total of five splitting narratives found in them:7 four splitting episodes in the 5. Granoff, "Siva and His Ganas." Granoff traces similar accounts for pur?nic stories of the destruction of Daksa's sacrifice, the Haricaritacint?mani, and the slicing off of Brahma's fifth head. See also Granoff, "Saving the Saviour," and "Mah?k?la's Journey." The term "early Skanda Pur?na" refers to a version of the text that is sig nificantly different from later texts carrying the same name. See Skandapur?na, vol. 1, for more details. 6. A distinction can be drawn between the "orthodox," or what becomes the pur?nic Saivite tradition, and the non-pur?nic Saivite tradition, or what becomes the tantric Saivite tradition. These are not necessarily exclusive cate gories, but for the most part this paper deals with the development of pur?nic Saivism in its precursor found in the epic tradition. For more on the distinction of pur?nic and non-pur?nic, see Flood, Introduction to Hinduism, 150-62. The absorption of Skanda into the orthodox or classical tradition likely follows a pattern recently explored by Smith, Self Possessed, 3-13, 425-26. Smith argues that the Sanskrit literati continually co-opted folk traditions. While he notes that the distinction between classical and folk, or between Sanskrit and vernacular, appears to be a self conscious division in Sanskrit culture, the contours between the two groups remained fluid. Smith also cites Skanda in the Mah?bh?rata and the appearance of Grahas in ayurvedic texts as examples of this process (pp. 272-73,481). 7. All references to the Mah?bh?rata are taken from the Critical Edition.</page><page sequence="3">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 449 ?ranyakaparvan account of the deity and one in the Salyaparvan. It may not be a coinci dence that the ?ranyakaparvan account of Skanda's birth contains so many of these splitting narratives. Many of these splitting narratives are about transformation, and the ?ranyaka parvan account of Skanda is an extended narrative dedicated to transforming the characteri zation of this deity.8 Most accounts of Skanda present him as the dutiful son of Siva, who was born to rid the three worlds of demons as the general of the army of the gods. The ?ranyakaparvan account, however, begins with Skanda as a terrible being who must be transformed into the benevolent figure assumed by most other textual accounts of the deity. Initially, Skanda is a destructive force who inspires fear and requires propitiatory worship. He is remorseless in his actions and appears to act with the intention of inspiring terror in others. He is also closely associated with various fierce groups of Grahas (Graspers), M?trs (Mothers), Kum?ras (Boys), and Kumaris (Girls), all figures associated with possession of children and pregnant women. These forms of possession were understood as a type of disease causation in the textual traditions that describe them.9 As we shall see, texts from the ayurvedic tradition explain this connection between Skanda and Grahas by presenting Skanda as a Grana himself. The epic tradition moves away from such a depiction of the deity. Even by the end of the ?ranyakaparvan account Skanda is separated from his more threat ening characterization to take a role as the general of the army of the gods and as the son of Siva. The ?ranyakaparvan account is peppered with narratives featuring beings falling off of Skanda to form new entities. Below I will discuss four "splitting off" stories that lead to the creation of five beings: Vis?kha, Skand?pasm?ra, the Kum?ras, the Kumar?s, and Sisu.10 I shall present these splitting narratives within the context of a brief account of the ?ran yakaparvan story of Skanda.n The story begins with Agni falling in love with the wives of the Seven Seers. Agni knows his desire for these women is improper, and he retires to the forest apparently to kill himself (MBh 3.213.35-46). A daughter of Daksa, Sv?h?, is in love with Agni and is aware of his feelings for the seven wives. She approaches Agni in the forest disguised as one of the seven wives and fools Agni into having sex with her. She repeats this act a total of six times, and after each encounter she takes the form of Garudi and flies to Mount Sveta, where she deposits Agni's semen into a golden jar (MBh 3.213.50-52; 214.1-14).12 After six units of semen are placed in the pot on the first day of lunation, Skanda begins to take form as a six-headed child, growing at a preternaturally fast rate and reaching boyhood in four days (MBh 3.214.17-18). Unlike the innocent youth so often described in later accounts, this child is initially chaotic and violent. He is a massive being whose roar stupefies all of the beings in the three worlds (MBh 3.214.19). The divine war elephants Citra and Air?vata attack Skanda, but he simply grabs the two elephants and is described as romping around holding them along with a spear and a giant cock (MBh 3.214.22-24). He shoots arrows at Mount Sveta and cleaves off Mount Krau?ca, which groans loudly with 8. I have argued elsewhere that this version of the birth of this deity may tell us the most about his origins. See Mann, "Parthian and Hellenistic Influences," 112-17, and "Early Cult," 19-21. Another means of discussing a "trans formation of characterization" is to suggest that splitting narratives often involve issues of identity. For more on the issue of identity in relation to this theme, see Doniger, Splitting the Difference, 128-29, 133. 9. For more on possession in the epics and ayurvedic material, see Smith, Self Possessed, 245-76, 471-557. 10. The order of figures I have given here does not correspond to the order of their appearance in the epic nar rative. Rather, I have listed them in order of appearance in my analysis. The reasons for doing so will become apparent. 11. A number of scholars have discussed this narrative. See Agrawala, Skanda-K?rttikeya, 25-37; Bedekar, "K?rttikeya (Skanda) in Sanskrit Literature," 142-57; Mann, "Early Cult," 15-89. None of these scholars has dis cussed the splitting off narratives in any detail. 12. For more on the role of Sv?h? and Agni in this narrative, see O'Flaherty, Asceticism and Eroticism, 90-103.</page><page sequence="4">450 Journal of the American Oriental Society 111 A (2007) pain as it crashes to the earth (MBh 3.214.31-32). The other mountains groan with fear, and we are told sa tarn n?dam bhrs?rt?n?m srutv?pi balin?m varah/ na pr?vyathad amey?tm? saktim udyamya c?nadat// That best of the strong, even after hearing the crying of the greatly afflicted, was not distressed, and that immeasurable being lifted his spear and roared. (MBh 3.214.33) Note the lack of remorse here. Skanda's attacks are random and without conscience. His victims are simply those within range; there is no sense that he attacks out of a moral mandate. He goes on to cut off the top of Mount Sveta. Out of fear Sveta and the other mountains leave the earth, causing her great pain. The only means of control that the earth, the mountains, and the creatures near Skanda have over this dangerous new force is propi tiation. After his roar, which shocked all the beings of the three worlds, the text tells us tasya tarn ninadam srutv? nyapatan bahudh? jan?h/ bhlt?s codvignamanasas tam eva saranam yayuh// ye tu tam samsrit? devant n?n?varn?s tad? jan?h/ tan apy ?huh p?risad?n br?hman?h sumah?bal?n// sa t?tth?ya mah?b?hur upas?ntvya ca t?n jan?n/ Having heard his cry the creatures, who were terrified and anxious, repeatedly collapsed and went to him for refuge. Those creatures of various classes who had sought the protection of that god, Brahmins call them the very powerful retinue of that god. That strong-armed one stood up and comforted those creatures. (MBh 3.214.28-30) The earth follows suit and regains her strength. The mountains also pay homage to Skanda and return to the earth. To make the point that propitiation of the deity is what is required to appease his violence, the text closes chapter 214 with ath?yam abhajal lokah skandam suklasya pa?camlm Now the world honored Skanda on the fifth day of the bright fortnight. (MBh 3.214.37) The gods are nervous about this new force. They demand that Indra do something about Skanda, but Indra is unwilling to take on this powerful child, and he sends a band of M?trs, or "Mothers," to kill the child-god.13 The M?trs fail in their mission, however. Instead of killing the child, they adopt him and become his fierce protectors (MBh 3.215.13-18). In chapter 216 Indra and the army of the gods must now march out against Skanda and his M?trs.14 Skanda easily defeats the army of the gods and then battles Indra. This battle leads to the first splitting narrative: tyakto devais tatah skande vajram sakro 'bhyav?srjat/ tad visrstam jagh?n?su p?rsvam skandasya daksinam/ bibheda ca maharaja p?rsvam tasya mah?tmanah// vajraprah?r?t skandasya samj?tah puruso 'parah/ yuv? k?ncanasamn?hah saktidhrg divyakundalah/ y ad vajravisan?j j?to vis?khas tena so 'bhavat// 13. One might think Indra's choice of the "Mothers" to battle Skanda as odd at first, but these Mothers are Grahas and ideally suited to destroy an infant. 14. Also on Skanda's side is Agni. In the ?ranyakaparvan version of Skanda's birth, Agni is presented as his birth father, who joins his son in the battle against the other gods. Later in the ?ranyakaparvan Siva is presented as the true father of the child, as we shall see.</page><page sequence="5">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 451 Thus abandoned by the gods, Sakra threw his vajra at Skanda. That hurled one swiftly struck the right side of Skanda, O great king, and split the side of that mighty one. Due to that vajra strike on Skanda, another man was born. He was a youth who had a golden coat of mail, who held a spear, and who wore wonderful earrings. Due to his birth from the vajra entering (Skanda), he became Vis?kha ('branched' or 'forked'). (MBh 3.216.12-13)15 With the appearance of this second foe Indra surrenders to Skanda. Chapter 217 then briefly describes other groups of beings that were split off from Skanda as a result of Indra's vajra strike: skandasya p?rsad?n ghor?n srnusv?dbhutadarsan?n/ vajraprah?r?t skandasya jaj?us tatra kum?rak?hJ ye haranti sis?? j?t?n garbhasth?ms caiva d?run?h// vajraprah?r?t kany?s ca jaj?ire 'sya mah?bal?h/ kum?ras ca vis?kham tarn pitrtve samakalpayan// Now hear of the terrible retinue of Skanda whose appearance is extraordinary. The Little Boys (kum?raka) were born there due to the vajra strike on Skanda. They are the ones who cruelly rob infants, both those born and those still in the womb. Very powerful Maidens (kany?) were also born from his vajra strike. The Boys (kum?ra) settled on Vis?kha as their father. (MM 3.217.1-2) The creation of these Kum?ras and Kany?s represent a second splitting off account in this text. The remainder of chapter 217 is rather confusing, but it features the Maidens just mentioned asking Skanda to make them M?trs, specifically "the first Mothers of all the world" (sarvalokasya. . . m?tara uttam?h) (MBh 3.217.7). Skanda does this and separates them into auspicious and inauspicious Mothers. The remainder of the chapter is difficult to make sense of, but it attempts to establish a group of nine, the "Navaka." The creation of the Navaka begins with the production of Sisu, the Newborn. The text states that the group of M?trs mentioned above had et?s?m v?ryasampannah sisur n?m?tid?runah/ skandapras?dajah putro lohit?kso bhayamkarah// esa v?rastakah proktah skandam?trganodbhavah/ ch?gavaktrena sahito navakah pariklrtyate// a son, named the Newborn (Sisu), who was powerful, very terrible, frightening, had red eyes, and who was a gift of Skanda. These are called the eight heroes. They sprang from the group of M?trs and Skanda. Along with the Goat-faced one, they are called the "Navaka." (MBh 3.217.10-11) Presumably the group of nine consists of the seven M?trs, Sisu, and Ch?gavaktra, or the Goat-faced one. As we shall see, this is likely a list of nine Grahas, known elsewhere as responsible for the death of children. The creation of Sisu, the terrifying, red-eyed newborn, is the third splitting narrative. Chapter 218 switches the tone of the story dramatically. Here Skanda is offered the kingship of the gods, a post he turns down. He is then offered the captaincy of the army of the gods, which he accepts (MBh 3.218.1-22). A consecration ceremony (abhiseka) is per formed, after which he is re-characterized as an ideal warrior and protector of order: 15. This story of Vis?kha's origins may be alluded to in an earlier passage in the Mah?bh?rata, 1.60.23, which describes Vis?kha as born from Skanda's back.</page><page sequence="6">452 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127.4 (2007) saktir varma balam tejah k?ntatvam satyam aksatih/ brahmanyatvam asammoho bhakt?n?m pariraksanam// nikrntanam ca satr?n?m lok?n?m c?bhiraksanam/ skandena sahaj?t?ni sarv?ny eva jan?dhipa// The spear, armor, strength, splendor, beauty, truth, invulnerability, Brahmanic faith, lack of confusion, protection of worshipers, and the destruction of enemies, and the protection of all the worlds were all born along with Skanda, O king. (MBh 3.218.34-35) This is a remarkable shift in perspective on this deity, who moments before defeated Indra and the army of the gods, but such is the transformation this text aims to achieve. The next chapter features Skanda accepting a number of M?trs as his "mothers." One such group leads to the fourth splitting narrative in the birth story. A group of M?trs com plain to Skanda that he has allowed another group of M?trs to usurp their position. The M?trs tell Skanda y?s tu t? m?tarah p?rvam lokasy?sya prakalpit?h/ asm?kam tad bhavet sth?nam t?s?m caiva na tad bhavet// bhavema p?jy? lokasya na t?h p?jy?h surarsabha/ praj?sm?kam16 hrt?s t?bhis tvatkrte t?h pray aecha nah// These ones who were made the first Mothers of this world, that position should be ours and should not be theirs. We should be worshiped in the world; they should not be worshiped, O best of the gods. Because of you they have taken away our offspring, give them back to us. (MBh 3.219.16-17) Skanda refuses to give back their progeny, but he will give them other offspring. The M?trs answer icch?ma t?s?m m?tfn?m praj? bhoktum prayaccha nah/ tvay? saha prthagbh?t? ye ca t?s?m athesvar?h// We want to eat the offspring of those Mothers; give them to us, those ones who are different from you (i.e., the mortal offspring of human mothers) and their lords (the human mothers or parents themselves). (MBh 3.219.19)17 Skanda grants their request, but adds pariraksata bhadram vah praj?h s?dhu namaskrt?h// . . . please save their offspring who worship properly. (MBh 3.219.20)18 The M?trs are happy with the arrangement, and Skanda goes on to tell these M?trs y?vat sodasa vars?ni bhavanti tarun?h praj?h/ prab?dhata manusy?n?m t?vad r?paih prthagvidhaih// aham ca vah prad?sy?mi raudram ?tm?nam avyayam/ paramam tena sahit? sukham vatsyatha p?jit?h// m?rkandeya uv?ca/ tatah sarir?t skandasya purusah k?neanaprabhah/ 16. The sandhi for praj?sm?kam (-?- &lt; -?s + a-) is irregular but not uncommon in the epic. See Oberlies, Grammar of Epic Sanskrit, 40-46. 17. With Filliozat (?tude de d?monologie, 74), I take the "Mothers" being complained about here to be human mothers. Hence, the divine Mothers are asking to take human children and human mothers. 18. The implications of this exchange are significant. WTiile the ?ranyakaparvan never acknowledges a being called Skanda-graha as ayurvedic texts do, this exchange implies that Skanda gives his support, or at least his con sent, to the M?trs in their attacks on children.</page><page sequence="7">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 453 bhoktum praj?h sa marty?n?m nispap?ta mah?balah// apatat sa tad? bh?mau visamj?o 'tha ksudh?nvitah/ skandena so 'bhyanujn?to raudrar?po 'bhavad grahah/ skand?pasm?ram ity ?hur graham tarn dvijasattam?h// "Injure the young children of people until they are sixteen years old with your different forms, and I will give to you a violent immortal spirit. You, who are much worshiped, will dwell along with it in the best of happiness." M?rkandeya said: "Then a being that glittered with gold and was mighty fell out from the body of Skanda. He was to consume the offspring of mortals. Then, he fell to the earth senseless and hungry. He had a fierce form and was allowed by Skanda to become a Grana. Brahmins call that Grana 'Skand?pasm?ra'." (MBh 3.219.22-25) The creation of Skand?pasm?ra is our fourth splitting narrative in the ?ranyakaparvan. After the creation of Skand?pasm?ra a list of Grahas is given (MBh 3.219.26-40). The entire group is to be called the Skandagrahas, "the Skanda Graspers" (MBh 3.219.42). The text claims that they will grant well-being, long life, and virility if propitiated by worship. Specifically, the text counsels the performance of the "rite of Skanda" (skandasyejy?) (MBh 3.219.43-44). In essence, we are told that these beings are subservient to Skanda, and one may control them through worship of him. Chapter 220 is important because it attempts to establish Siva as the true father of Skanda. Earlier in the account Agni was depicted as Skanda's birth father, but here the young deity is encouraged to approach Siva (MBh 3.220.8-9), and Skanda's subservience to his father is established by his worship of Mahesvara (MBh 3.220.13). The wildness of Skanda that we saw just after his birth disappears once he becomes the obedient and dutiful son of Siva. The narrative ends in chapter 221, where Skanda enacts his new role as a defender of order and the gods by destroying the demon Mahisa.19 I have not done justice to the narrative of Skanda's birth and deeds here in order to focus attention on the four splitting narratives, which I will now examine in more detail. I begin with the Vis?kha and Skand?pasm?ra narratives and consider these narratives together because they are connected in a manner not obvious from the account given in the ?ranya kaparvan; in the early ayurvedic textual tradition Vis?kha and Skand?pasm?ra are viewed as the same figure. 2. THE VIS?KHA AND SKAND?PASM?RA NARRATIVES Before turning to the early ayurvedic material, and in particular the Susrutasamhit?, I will first argue for a shared historical and conceptual context between the Susrutasamhit? and the Mah?bh?rata. As genres of texts, the early ayurvedic and epic texts differ considerably in content and likely in use and audience. With these obvious differences aside, I suggest that these texts took shape in roughly the same period, and that they share similar agendas in relation to Skanda and the Grahas. Jan Meulenbeld and Kenneth Zysk suggest that the ayurvedic tradition developed in India between the second century b.c.e. and the second cen tury ce.;20 the Susrutasamhit? appears to belong to this formative period. The text itself is likely a collection of material produced by a number of different authors over different times.21 While there has been wide variance in dates attributed to the text, recent scholarship 19. Most versions of Skanda's story have him kill the demon Tar?ka. The ?ranyakaparvan account is a rare version in which he kills Mahisa, a narrative more typically associated with Durg?. 20. Meulenbeld, History, 1A: 342-43; Zysk, Asceticism and Healing, 13. 21. Meulenbeld, History, 1A: 348.</page><page sequence="8">454 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127 .4 (2007) suggests a final redaction before 500 c.e.22 These general dates for the Susrutasamhit? place its redaction within the general dates proposed for the redaction of the Mah?bh?rata.23 Hence, both texts developed in the period from the post-Mauryan empire, through the Kus?na empire, and on to the Gupta empire, within the general context of Sanskrit culture. I have argued elsewhere that non-textual sources (statues, panels, and numismatics) from this time period (circa 200 b.c.e. to 500 c.e.) illustrate a dramatic shift in the characterization of Skanda and likely a shift in his cult base.24 These shifts transformed Skanda from pri marily a Graha figure into the general of the army of the gods, and they also transformed his cult from a broad-based propitiatory context to one more focused on royal propaganda.25 The shifts in non-textual sources help to explain the characterization of Skanda in epic and ayurvedic sources. At issue here is the texts' shared desire to remove Skanda from a disease causing context. That divinities cause disease is an accepted aspect of classical Hinduism; hence the objection to Skanda as an agent of disease in these texts is not based in a broader perspective on the nature of divinity imparted by Sanskrit culture. Instead, I would suggest, the objection to Skanda as a source of disease in these texts is a reflection of shifts in his lived cult at this time. Hence the different textual genres I study here are linked by a shared chronological period and a shared interest in shifting the characterization of Skanda in similar directions, which fit larger socio-cultural shifts in his cult and depiction as a whole. As will also become apparent, and as Filliozat and Smith have already observed,26 there is a strong correlation between the B?lagraha section of the ?ranyakaparvan (MBh 3.217; 3.219) and the depiction of Grahas in the Susrutasamhit?. If the two texts were not aware of each other, there can be little doubt they shared similar sources and held similar views on how Skanda and Grahas should be characterized. Let us now return to the Grahas named Vis?kha and Skand?pasm?ra and their depiction in epic and ayurvedic sources. The ayurvedic textual tradition presents a single Graha, alternately named Vis?kha and Skand?pasm?ra, who has close ties to another Graha named Skanda. One of these early ayurvedic texts is the Susrutasamhit?. Chapters 27-37 of its Uttaratantra section deal with the Navagrahas, or the "Nine Graspers." The rather confused account of the "Navaka" from chapter 217 of the ?ranyakaparvan may be related to this section of the Susrutasamhit?. 22. Wujastyk, Roots, 105-6; Meulenbeld, History, 1A: 342-52. 23. See Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mah?bh?rata, 2-26, for a review of scholarship on the date of the epic text. The majority of scholars view the development of the Mah?bh?rata on similar lines as those I have described for the Susrutasamhit?: a text collected over a lengthy period of time by many different hands. See Fitzgerald, Mah? bh?rata, 146-52; "Many Voices," 810-12; and "Negotiating the Shape," 257-84, for the most recent account of this perspective on the text. The most prominent opponent to this perspective is Alf Hiltebeitel, who argues for a composition of the epic within two generations sometime between 150 b.c.e. and the year zero; see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mah?bh?rata, 18, and "N?r?yanlya," 227. While Fitzgerald and Hiltebeitel hold divergent views on the compositional history of the text, both agree that it represents something of a Brahmanical reaction to Mauryan rule, and both see the post-Mauryan era of the second century b.c.e. to the year zero as central to the text's develop ment. See Fitzgerald, "Negotiating the Shape," 259 and "Many Voices," 811; and Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mah? bh?rata, 17-19. As I have already mentioned, this same period is viewed as central for the development of early ayurvedic texts. Zysk has also argued (Asceticism and Healing) that the ayurvedic tradition originated within Buddhism and sramana groups, and was then adopted by Brahmanical sources. Hence, both the epic and ayurvedic traditions can be viewed as something of a Brahmanical reassertion of power in the post-Mauryan period. 24. Mann, "Parthian and Hellenistic." 25.

Filliozat (Etude de d?monologie, 11) suggests that either the Susrutasamhit? borrowed directly from the Mah?bh?rata, or that the two texts shared the same source for this material related to Grahas.and Skanda. Smith (Self Possessed, 273) notes: "This section of the ?ranyakaparvan is probably contemporaneous with the early first millennium ayurvedic texts and was almost certainly adopted from them and mythologized in the Mbh."</page><page sequence="9">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 455 The list of the Navagrahas in the medical text is as follows: Skanda, Skand?pasm?ra, Sakun?, Revat?, P?tan?, Andhap?tan?, Sitap?tan?, Mukhamandik?, and Naigamesa (Su Utt 27.4-5).27 The text goes on to identify Skand?pasm?ra with Vis?kha and to suggest the close relation ship between this being and Skanda-graha: skand?pasm?rasamjno yah so 'gnin?gnisamadyutih/ sa ca skandasakh? n?ma vis?kha iti cocyate// That one who is called Skand?pasm?ra, he (was created) by Agni, and he is equal in radiance to Agni, and he is both Skandasakh? ('Friend of Skanda') by name and is called Vis?kha. (Su Utt 37.7)28 Other ayurvedic texts seem to agree with the Susrutasamhit? in presenting Vis?kha and Skan d?pasm?ra as a single Graha associated with Skanda-graha. The Ast?ngahrdayasamhit? (ca. 600 ce.)29 provides the following list of B?lagrahas in its Uttarasth?na section: Skanda, Vis?kha, Mesa, Svagraha, Pitrgraha, Sakuni, P?tan?, Sitap?tan?, Adrstip?tan?, Mukha manditik?, Revat?, and Suskarevat? (AH Utt 3.1-3). Under the list of symptoms for the various Grahas, Vis?kha's name is replaced by Skand?pasm?ra's, suggesting that the text equates the two figures (AH Utt 3.9-11). The ayurvedic tradition, then, does not recognize a creation account of Vis?kha/Skand?pasm?ra in which the Graha comes out of Skanda. Nor does the ayurvedic tradition view Vis?kha and Skand?pasm?ra as two separate figures. Skanda-graha and Vis?kha/Skand?pasm?ra are closely related in these texts; they always appear in the same order next to each other in lists of Grahas, and, as the above quotation suggests, they are viewed as "friends."30 These ayurvedic texts also leave no doubt as to the Graha nature of Skanda and Vis?kha/Skand?pasm?ra, an aspect that the ?ranyakaparvan only acknowledges in the case of Skand?pasm?ra. 2.1 The splitting of Skand?pasm?ra as a distancing narrative The ?ranyakaparvan account of Vis?kha and Skand?pasm?ra represents, then, something of a double splitting. Not only does the text present these figures as falling off from Skanda, but the narrative also, at least from the perspective of the ayurvedic tradition, splits them from each other. To understand why the epic text presents them in this manner we must look more carefully at the narratives themselves. I begin with the account of Skand?pasm?ra. 27. Most of these nine also appear in chapter 219 of the ?ranyakaparvan in its list of Skanda's Graspers. That text mentions Skand?pasm?ra (MBh 3.219.15), Vinat?, who is described as a sakuni-graha, or 'bird-grasper' (MBh 3.219.16), P?tan? (MBh 3.219.16), S?tap?tana (MBh 3.219.17), Revati, whose Grana this text names Raivata (MBh 3.219.18), and Mukhamandik? (MBh 3.219.19). Only Andhap?tan? and Naigamesa make no appearance in the ?ranyakaparvan account, though a goat-faced (chagavaktra) figure is mentioned in 217.11-12, possibly related to the ram-headed Naigamesa. For more details on the M?trs in the ?ranyakaparvan account, see White, Kiss of the Yogini, 36-45, and Smith, Self Possessed, 272-74. 28. In chapter 27 of this text, Skand?pasm?ra is simply referred to as Sakh? (Su 6.27.9); also see Filliozat (?tude de d?monologie, 43-44) for the use of Sakh?. The name Skand?pasm?ra ('Skanda's Epilepsy') suggests that the disease inflicted by this Graha is epilepsy. Curiously, the Susrutasamhit? has a separate section (61) on apasm?ra in the Uttaratantra that makes no mention of a Graha cause. Instead this section of the text argues for a root cause found in dosas. The term apasm?ra may refer to convulsions or seizures of any kind, rather than being limited to epilepsy; see Smith, Self Possessed, 482. 29. Wujastyk, Roots, 241; Meulenbeld, History, 1A: 631-35. A related text, the Ast?ngasamgraha, is similar to the Ast?hgahrdayasamhit? in its depiction of these Grahas. 30. A late Vedic ritual text, the Atharvavedaparisista, describes Vis?kha as a brother of Skanda in its Skanda y?ga section (20.2.9).</page><page sequence="10">456 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127 A (2007) An important aspect of the Skanda and Skand?pasm?ra story is an attempt to dissociate Skanda from disease causation; it is a type of "distancing narrative."31 In the production of Skand?pasm?ra a negative or terrible manifestation was split away from Skanda, to distance the god from his role as a source of illness. The exchange between Skanda and the M?trs in chapter 219 comes close to implicitly identifying Skanda as a Graha?the M?trs ask Skanda to allow them to engage in snatching children, and he accepts their proposal (MBh 3.219.16-25). The production of Skand?pasm?ra specifically to aid the M?trs in their terri ble activities seems to qualify the agreement. The text seems to assert that Skanda himself is not a Graha, since an offshoot will perform this function.32 Clearly the ?ranyakaparvan account does not endorse the existence of a Graha named Skanda. If the epic text has an agenda, it is to separate Skanda from his Graha connections and re-characterize him as a force of control over Grahas, as opposed to being a Graha himself. The splitting off of Skand?pasm?ra helps facilitate this transformation. The splitting narrative of Skanda and Skand?pasm?ra at once acknowledges the close relationship between the two figures that is found in the ayurvedic tradition, but also repositions that relationship. In the ayurvedic tra dition the two Grahas are depicted somewhat equally as "friends." In the ?ranyakaparvan Skand?pasm?ra, as a product of Skanda, is under Skanda's control. Skand?pasm?ra is de scribed as unconscious and hungry; we may presume that some conscious direction and control of him is exercised by Skanda and the M?trs. Skanda's deliberate production of Skand?pasm?ra implies, then, that Skanda can be blamed for the creation of this Graha and the terrible deeds ascribed to him in the ?ranyakaparvan. While the story physically sepa rates Skanda from being a Graha, it does not completely separate him from the blame asso ciated with Grahas. We will explore later how the tradition deals with the implications of this blame. I will here only reiterate that the splitting of Skand?pasm?ra from Skanda is an ex ample of narrative distancing, which aims to dissociate Skanda from an alternate character ization as a cause of disease himself. 2.2 The splitting of Vis?kha as an assimilative narrative The case of Vis?kha in the ?ranyakaparvan is noticeably different from that of Skand? pasm?ra. Underlying the splitting narrative of Skand?pasm?ra is the text's acknowledgement of the danger this new being presents to children. By splitting this dangerous being from Skanda the narrative helps to establish a new image for Skanda. Such a line of reasoning does not work well in the case of Vis?kha in the epic, however, for the epic text never ex plicitly acknowledges that Skanda and Vis?kha are Grahas.33 The context of Vis?kha's splitting narrative and his future in relation to Skanda can help us to understand why the epic text treats this narrative of splitting differently from that of 31.1 have deliberately borrowed Granoff's terminology here, but it is worth noting that these epic narratives of distancing function in a different manner from the pur?nic distancing narratives she examines. See my comments in the conclusion for details. 32. The account of Skand?pasm?ra's splitting may be presented in vocabulary linked to abortion or miscarriage. The passage uses the verb nis^lpat ('fall') to describe the appearance of Skand?pasm?ra from the body of Skanda (MBh 3.219.24). As Jamison has argued (Ravenous Hyenas, 203-4), ava^lpad can mean miscarry. The roots ^Ipat and ^Jpad are virtually synonymous in the epic, and the prefix nis ('out') likely carries the same connotation as ava ('down'). The use of such language here is likely to allude to the function of Skand?pasm?ra; he is to cause mis carriages through possession. 33. The closest the text comes to alluding to Vis?kha's identity as portrayed in ayurvedic texts is in chapter 217.2, where the Kum?ras are described as taking Vis?kha as their father. The Kum?ras are Grahas, and I will discuss them in more detail below. No other text acknowledges a link between Vis?kha and the Kum?ras, and the epic text does not develop their relationship beyond this single verse.</page><page sequence="11">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 457 Skand?pasm?ra. The context of Vis?kha's creation is battle, which plays a significant role in defining his character. With the appearance of Vis?kha, Skanda gains a warrior ally. Indeed, it is the appearance of Vis?kha that prompts Indra to surrender (MBh 3.216.15). Another passage also suggests a twinning of Skanda and Vis?kha as warriors rather than as Grahas: in chapter 220 Indra gives two bells called Vaij ay antis that once adorned Air?vata to Vis?kha and Skanda (MBh 3.220.18-19). ek? tatra vis?khasya ghant? skandasya c?par?/ pat?k? k?rttikeyasya vis?khasya ca lohit?// There, one bell (was given) to Vis?kha and the other to Skanda. The pennant of K?rttikeya and Vis?kha is red. (MBh 3.220.19) The context here is the receipt of emblems of battle. Air?vata is a war elephant; Vaijayanti suggests an emblem of victory;34 the pennant is likely a battle banner. Most splitting narra tives are about a transformation of character. In the model we have seen thus far, a negative or dangerous attribute of Skanda physically leaves him, which has the effect of transforming the original deity's character. In Vis?kha's narrative, I would suggest, it is his underlying character and not Skanda's that is transformed. Once Skanda enters the battle in chapter 216 of the ?ranyakaparvan his new character as a warrior is set; he only requires the abhiseka in chapter 218 to formalize his role. It is Vis?kha who is separated from his Graha identity here through an elision of that identity; the text simply never acknowledges a connection between Skand?pasm?ra and Vis?kha, or the potential existence of a Vis?kha-graha. The text repositions Vis?kha with Skanda as a warrior.35 Why does the epic text take these steps to separate Vis?kha and Skand?pasm?ra in the manner it does? I would suggest that Vis?kha's splitting story is a narrative of inclusion, as opposed to the Skand?pasm?ra narrative of exclusion or distancing. The Vis?kha narrative tries to establish that the two figures, Skanda and Vis?kha, are alike, that they are of the same "stuff." The inverse is the case with Skanda and Skand?pasm?ra. There the message is that they are different, that they are not, or are no longer, of the same "stuff." In the case of Skand?pasm?ra the separation becomes a permanent feature of epic and pur?nic texts. The name "Skand?pasm?ra" largely disappears from later textual accounts of Skanda except within the ayurvedic tradition. Vis?kha does not share this fate. His name lives on, but as an epithet of Skanda; he stops being an independent entity and becomes an aspect of Skanda. If we turn to the splitting narrative contained in the Salyaparvan account of Skanda, we will see how this assimilation of Vis?kha progresses through this genre ?f splitting narratives. 2.3 The splitting narrative in the Skanda episode in the Salyaparvan The Salyaparvan account of Skanda's birth and deeds is noticeably different from the ?ranyakaparvan account. In the Salyaparvan there are no references to Grahas, and Skanda is never depicted with the fierce or dangerous characteristics associated with him early in the ?ranyakaparvan version of his birth. The Salyaparvan presents an unambiguously positive image of the deity, whose single role in the cosmos is to defeat demons as the general of the 34. Vaijayant? is taken from vijayanta, a name of Indra literally meaning 'victorious' (Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 961). Vaijayanta is both the banner of Indra and more generally a marker predicting victory (Monier-Williams, 1021). 35. There is also significant iconographie and numismatic evidence that links Skanda and Vis?kha, and icono graphie evidence that helps to trace Skanda's development from a Graha and into a warrior deity. See Mann, "Parthian and Hellenistic," and "Early Cult," 209-24.</page><page sequence="12">458 Journal of the American Oriental Society 121A (2007) army of the gods. I suggested above that the ?ranyakaparvan's narrative of Skanda was largely about transforming his character from a fierce Graha-like figure to a dutiful leader of an army and a force of control over Grahas?hence the large number of splitting narratives in that account. The Salyaparvan assumes this transformation has already been accomplished. I suspect that the Salyaparvan represents a later version of Skanda's mythology than the ?ranyakaparvan version, though I acknowledge that such chronological speculations are dif ficult to demonstrate concretely within the epic text.36 The Salyaparvan does not need split ting narratives that function to distance Skanda from past or competing characterizations of him; the text simply ignores the account of the deity from the ?ranyakaparvan and the ayurvedic tradition. Instead, the Salyaparvan uses splitting narratives in a manner similar to Vis?kha's in the ?ranyakaparvan, as a means to assimilate figures. The splitting of Skanda comes about in this account as a result of his multiple parentage. In the account of his birth Vaisamp?yana tells Janamejaya that the semen or energy (tejas) of Mahesvara (Siva) fell (skanna)31 into Agni (MBh 9.43.6). Agni was not able to handle the energy of this tejas and passed it on to Gang?, the goddess who is also the Ganges River. She was also not able to sustain the energy of Siva's tejas and dropped it in the Himalayas (MBh 9A3.1-9). The text begins, then, by acknowledging several parents for Skanda, but also by demonstrating the power of Siva through the potency of his tejas. Once the tejas was cast onto the mountain, "the son of fire" (jvalan?tmaja) began to grow (MBh 9.43.10). The six Krttik?s came across the child, and each claimed him as her own, by calling out: "This one is mine" (mam?yam iti) (MBh 9.43.11). To satisfy them Skanda suckled from each of them with his six heads. Shortly after this scene Vaisamp?yana reports that Skanda is also known as "K?rttikeya," which suggests he is the son of the Krttik?s, and "G?ngeya," which suggests he is the son of Gang? (MBh 9.43.16). The story presents Siva, Agni, Gang?, and the Krttik?s as possible parents for Skanda, and while the text suggests that Siva is the most powerful of them, it does not decide exclusively on any one of these as his real parent. Later Skanda approached Siva, Um?, Agni, and Gang?. Each of these deities hoped to be greeted first. To deal with this problem Skanda created three additional forms (m?rti) and greeted the four "parents" simultaneously (MBh 9.43.33-38). These other forms of Skanda are listed as Vis?kha, S?kha, and Naigamesa (MBh 9.43.37). This splitting is described as a conscious choice by Skanda, which required his yogic powers to be performed. The context and significance of this splitting narrative differs considerably from those we have thus far examined. In the Salyaparvan there is no terrible form of Skanda from which he needs to be separated. The splitting here is presented as a conscious attempt by a good son to keep his 36. My hypothesis here relies on the progressive sanitization of Skanda observable in the northern tradition as a whole. The trend in epic, pur?nic, and ayurvedic accounts of Skanda is to remove examples of extraneous violence and to distance him from Grahas. In the ?ranyakaparvan, for instance, Skanda is depicted as causing havoc in the world (MBh 3.213-14) and ultimately as defeating Indra and his army (MBh 3.216). These events are only repeated in the early Skanda Pur?na (163.20-32) and in the Rudrasamhit? of the Siva Pur?na (4.3.20-27), and only in a much abbreviated form. References to Skanda's association with Grahas are few in the pur?nas if they appear at all. Even in ayurvedic sources Skanda is steadily removed from an association with Grahas and does not appear in such later texts as the R?vana-Kum?ratantra; see Filliozat, Etude de d?monologie, 4-11. The ?ranyakaparvan and Salyaparvan appear to follow a similar pattern, which suggests that the Salya is the later of the two?though again I would stress the tentative nature of this hypothesis. 37. Skanna is often used in these accounts of Skanda to provide a folk etymology for Skanda, which can also mean 'spurting, effusing, spilling, shedding' (Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 1256). In this version of Skanda's birth the claim is made that Skanda is called such because he results from the skanna of Siva's tejas.</page><page sequence="13">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 459 many parents happy. While we know Vis?kha and Naigamesa to be Grahas and separate entities from Skanda in other texts, this account makes no allusion to these other identities. Here, they are forms (m?rti) of Skanda; this account of splitting is not designed to create a separation between Skanda and others, but rather to suggest that there is no difference between Skanda and these other figures. This splitting results in assimilation. A key differ ence here from most of the ?ranyakaparvan splitting narratives is the lack of a concern for disease causation and the blame associated with it. Without a concern for the potential blame that Skanda may receive because of the actions of his creations, the text seems free to expand his cult through such narratives by drawing in related cults.38 This process of assimilation is only implied in the ?ranyakaparvan account of Vis?kha, but we see it come to fruition in the Salyaparvan episode. 3. EXAMINATION OF THE KUM?RAS AND KANY?S/KUM?RIS NARRATIVE AND THE SISU NARRATIVE Our two final examples of splitting narratives from the ?ranyakaparvan are found in chapter 217 of the text. They are both, I would suggest, examples of splitting used to distance a figure from disease causation and can be quickly reviewed here. But first a brief note on the rather complex chapter 217 of the ?ranyakaparvan is needed. For the most part the story of Skanda as presented in the Critical Edition of the ?ranyakaparvan is clear. Such is not the case with chapter 217. The language in this chapter is often ambiguous, and the thread easy to lose. In many ways one can read chapter 219 as a clarification of the material in chapter 217. The text almost seems self-conscious of the problems in chapter 217 and attempts to explain itself in the much more coherent chapter 219. The account of the pro duction of Skand?pasm?ra in chapter 219 (MBh 3.219.24-25) can be viewed as a retelling of the production of Sisu from chapter 217 (MBh 3.217.10). Skanda's acknowledgement of a group of M?trs in chapter 217 (MBh 3.217.6-9) may also be reduplicated in a similar account from chapter 219 (MBh 3.219.14-23).39 Chapter 217 is also awkwardly placed in the narrative. Chapter 216 ends with the defeat of Indra by Skanda. Chapter 217 shifts to an account of beings created through the battle, but it also includes a band of Mothers approach ing Skanda, as well as some obscure comments related to a group of nine and Skanda's six heads. Much of chapter 217 seems designed to introduce the connection of Skanda with Grahas and M?trs, but it does so in an obscure manner. Chapter 218 returns us to the immediate aftermath of the battle with Indra and the elevation of Skanda to the captaincy of the army of the gods. Chapter 219 then reintroduces Skanda's connection to M?trs and Grahas in a much more systematic manner than chapter 217. If we deleted chapter 217, 38. Ultimately, I would suggest that the differences between a narrative of distancing and one of assimilation in these accounts of Skanda is one of degree, not a categorical difference. One could argue, for instance, in the case of Skand?pasm?ra that his narrative also implies an assimilation of Skand?pasm?ra's cult into Skanda's. Skand? pasm?ra stops being an individual entity and becomes something belonging to Skanda, who is controlled through the worship of Skanda. While I acknowledge that this may be the case, I still hold that the main point of the narra tive is to distance Skanda from disease causation. 39. The vocabulary in chapter 217 also marks the chapter as unusual. Chapters 217 and 219 both treat material directly related to Grahas, but while fairly standard vocabulary used in ayurvedic texts related to Grahas is mimicked in chapter 219, this is not so in chapter 217. The word graha, for instance, is used frequently in ayurvedic accounts and in chapter 219, but is not found in chapter 217. Forms of the root Vgra/i ('grasp', 'possess') are also common in ayurvedic accounts of these beings and in chapter 219 (MBh 3.219.31, 37, 38), but are conspicuously absent from chapter 217.</page><page sequence="14">460 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127.4 (2007) we would be left with a much more cohesive narrative. While it is difficult to be certain, I suspect chapter 217 is an earlier, or perhaps different, attempt to account for Skanda and the beings connected to him in the tradition. With these issues about this chapter in mind, we will briefly examine its account of the beings produced from the body of Skanda. As we have seen, chapter 217 opens by telling us that a group alternately called the Kum?rakas (MBh 3.217.1) and Kum?ras (MBh 3.217.2) was also created from Indra's vajra strike. They are unambiguously described as acting like Grahas: ye haranti sis?? j?t?n garbhasth?ms caiva d?run?h// Those who cruelly rob infants, both those born and those still in the womb. (MBh 3.217.1) From the same strike a group of Girls or Maidens ('Kany?s') was also produced. The chapter then presents some confusing comments about the Kany?s. vajraprah?r?t kany?s ca jaj?ire 'sya mah?bal?h/ kum?ras ca vis?kham tarn pitrtve samakalpayan// sa bh?tv? bhagav?n samkhye raksams ch?gamukhas tad?V vrtah kany?ganaih sarvair ?tmanlnais ca putrakaih// m?tfn?m preksatin?m ca bhadras?khas ca kausalah/ tatah kum?rapitaram skandam ?hurjan? bhuvi// Very powerful Maidens were also born from his vajra strike, and the Kum?ras settled on Vis?kha as their father. The blessed one, having become goat-faced, protects in battle sur rounded by all the troops of Maidens and his own sons, and Bhadras?kha (provides) prosperity while the Mothers look on. Thus, people in the world say Skanda is the father of Boys (kum?ras). (MBh 3.217.2-4) As we already know, the text links these Kum?ras to Vis?kha and then places the Kany?s into a battle context with "the blessed one," though the identity of the "blessed one" is not completely clear.40 Later in the chapter these Kany?s approach Skanda to become M?trs of the world. The flow of the material is unclear and the exact status of the Kum?ras and Kany?s is difficult to grasp. Chapter 219 seems aware of these problems and includes the following account of them in its list of Grahas: kum?ras ca kum?ryas ca ye prokt?h skandasambhav?h/ te 'pi garbhabhujah sarve kauravya sumah?grah?h// t?s?m eva kum?rln?m patayas te praklrtit?h/ aj??yam?n? grhnanti b?lak?n raudrakarminah// 40. While the context of the passage suggests that the "blessed one" is Visakha, a later section of the chapter states: sastham ch?gamayam vaktram skandasyaiveti viddhi tat/ satsirobhyantaram r?jan nityam m?trganareitam// sann?m tu pravaram tasya sirs?n?m iha sabdyate/ saktim yen?srjad divy?m bhadras?kha iti sma ha// Know, O king, that the sixth face from among his (Skanda's) six heads is like a goat's face, which is always worshiped by the band of Mothers. Now, the best of his six heads is called Bhadras?kha with which he created the divine Sakti (Skanda's spear). (MBh 3.217.12-13) This passage seems to suggest that the goat-headed blessed one from the above passage is Skanda. Adding to the confusion is the status of Bhadras?kha. The quotation here (3.217.12-13) suggests that Bhadras?kha is one of Skanda's heads, but the above quotation (3.217.2-4) suggests that Bhadras?kha is a separate entity.</page><page sequence="15">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 461 Those who are proclaimed as Kum?ras and Kum?ris and who were born from Skanda, they, O Kauravya, are all very great Graspers who are eaters of fetuses. They (the Kum?ras) are said to be the husbands of those Kum?ris. They, who perform terrible acts, seize young children while remaining unknown. (MBh 3.219.30-31) Assuming that the Kany?s and Kum?ris are the same figures,41 it appears that both Kum?ras and Kany?s/Kum?ri are classes of Graha. Here, I would suggest, we have another example of a splitting narrative designed to separate Skanda from disease causation. The final splitting off story is that of Sisu, the terrible red-eyed "Newborn" of the Kany?/ M?trs from chapter 217 (MBh 3.217.9-10). The identity of Sisu is not altogether clear, but there are some links between the creation of Sisu and that of Skand?pasm?ra from chapter 219. Skand?pasm?ra was created as a gift to the M?trs to help them in their child-snatching activities. Similarly, Sisu comes into being through the power of Skanda as a companion to the M?trs, and he is described as a skandapras?daja 'a gift of Skanda'. Unlike Skand?pa sm?ra, Sisu is not named as a Graha in the obscure chapter 217, but he is described as terrible and frightening, and he is part of the Navaka, which may be related to the Navagrahas of the Susrutasamhit?. Given the context of Sisu's creation and the links to the creation of Skand?pasm?ra, I would suggest that Sisu is a Graha, and like the story of Skand?pasm?ra, the narrative was designed to distance Skanda from a Graha characterization. 4. SPLITTING NARRATIVES AND DISTANCING FROM BLAME FOR DISEASE CAUSATION! THE NARRATIVES FROM THE ?RANYAKAPARVAN I suggested above that the conscious creation of Skand?pasm?ra and Skanda's tacit support of the M?trs' activities (MBh 3.219.22-25) did not create much distance between Skanda and the blame associated with childhood illness due to possession by a Graha/M?tr. We may, however, detect a movement towards a moralization of the Grahas/M?trs and their roles, resulting in a different means of removing Skanda from blame. The tradition begins to shift the blame for a child's illness away from Skanda and towards the parents of the child. This change can be observed within the ?ranyakaparvan narrative itself. The first time we meet the M?trs in chapter 215 of the text, they were sent by Indra to kill Skanda. The text gives the following account of why they do not kill the young god: tarn ?pratibalam drstv? visannavadan?s tu t?h/ asakyo 'yam vicintyaivam tam eva saranam yayuh// Having seen that one of unequaled power, they looked dejected. Having realized that he could not (be defeated), they went to him for protection. (MBh 3.215.17) There is no sense of correct or incorrect behavior in the choices of the M?trs. They do not attack Skanda because they do not think they can defeat him. The same can be said for Skanda's initial destructive actions immediately following his birth. His actions are random and not connected to the moral standing of his victims. A noticeable shift occurs by chapter 219 of the text. Now the M?trs and Skand?pasm?ra are to avoid attacking the children of those who honor them. As we have seen, honoring or worshiping these beings is, in effect, to worship Skanda. While Skanda can be blamed for the actions of these M?trs and Skand? pasm?ra, the text allows for a mechanism where the victim, or, in the more likely case of a child victim, the victim's parents ultimately receive the blame for not properly worshiping 41. Filliozat (?tude de d?monologie, 74) regards the Kanyas and Kumar?s to be the same.</page><page sequence="16">462 Journal of the American Oriental Society 121A (2007) Skanda and the Grahas. There is a doubling of separation in this account: Skanda is separated from his Graha roots through the production of Skand?pasm?ra, Kumaras/Kumar?s, and Sisu, and are all separated from the guilt of afflicting children because the motivation for possession is determined by the actions of the victim's parents. This transference of blame from the deity and to the victim's family is subtle and implicit in this account, but we will see this idea furthered in ayurvedic accounts of Skanda detailed below. 5. THE CASE OF SKANDA IN THE SUSRUTASAMHIT? As we have already observed, the Susrutasamhit? discusses a group of nine Grahas led by a Graha named Skanda, described as the most dangerous of the nine: grahopasrst? b?l?s tu duscikitsyatam? mat?h/ vaikalyam maranam c?pi dhruvam skandagrahe matam// skandagraho 'tyugratamah sarvesv eva yatah smrtahJ It is known that children afflicted by Grahas are extremely difficult to cure. In the case of (an attack by) Skanda-graha it is known that permanent weakness and even death (will occur). Of all of those (Grahas) Skanda-graha is known as the most horrible. (Su Utt 37.21-22) We have also seen, however, a desire by the broader tradition to separate Skanda from this dangerous characterization. The challenge the Susruta faces is how to accommodate both versions of the deity. Unlike the epic tradition, which eliminates the existence of Skanda graha, the Susrutasamhit? represents a different textual genre that may not have been com fortable with eliding the existence of such a figure. The Susrutasamhit? is convinced of the existence of a Skanda-graha and cannot ignore the existence of these pathogens. At the same time it seems to be aware of the larger shifts in the tradition to an image for Skanda as the military leader of the gods. To manage this disconnect between its Skanda-graha and the epic's Skanda, the text argues that Skanda-graha and Skanda-deva are different beings. This form of splitting is less physical than those we have thus far examined, but it demonstrates the same general moralizing shift that drives elements of the narrative tradition related to Skanda during this period. Most of the material on B?lagrahas in the Susrutasamhit? does not openly acknowledge any difference between a Skanda-deva and a Skanda-graha. The argument for a difference between the two figures is limited to chapter 37 of the Uttaratantra section of the text.42 The section begins by presenting a discussion of the Navagrahas: ath?to grahotpattim adhy?yam vy?khy?sy?mah/Zyathov?ca bhagav?n dhanvantar?h/f nava skand?dayah prokt? b?l?n?m ya ime grah?h/ srlmanto divyavapuso n?rlpurusavigrah?h// ete guhasya raks?rtham krttikom?gnis?libhih/ srst?h saravanasthasya raksitasy?tmatejas?// Now we will discuss the lesson on the origin of the Graspers as the glorious Dhanvantari told it. The Nine who are those graspers of children are proclaimed beginning with Skanda. The glorious ones of divine form are divided into male and female. They were created by Sulin, Agni, Um?, and Krttik?s for the protection of Guha, who, while abiding in the thicket of reeds, was pro tected by his own energy. (Su Utt 37.1-4) 42. Filliozat (?tude de d?monologie, 44-45) comes to a similar conclusion, noting that the mantras for Skanda graha before chapter 37 assimilate the Graha to Skanda-deva. It is only with Uttaratantra 37.9-10 and in Dalhana's commentary that a distinction is drawn between Skanda-graha and Skanda-deva.</page><page sequence="17">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 463 Initially, the text seems confused. We already know that Skanda is a member of the Nava graha, so, assuming that Skanda and Guha are identical, how could Skanda be part of the group created to protect himself? I argue that the text is not really confused here, but is actually forwarding an agenda. It hopes to suggest that there are really two Skandas, one called Skanda-Guha and another called Skanda-graha. The Susrutasamhit? goes on to describe the powers and function of the other Grahas. Naigamesa and Vis?kha are both described as friends of Guha and Skanda (Su Utt 37.6-7). Then we read the following de scription of Skanda: skandah srsto bhagavat? devena tripur?rin?/ bibharti c?par?m samjn?m kum?ra iti sa grahah// b?lalil?dharo yo 'yam devo rudr?gnisambhavah/ mithy?c?resu bhagav?n svayam naisa pravartate// kum?rah skandas?m?ny?d atra kecid apandit?h/ grhn?tity alpavijn?n? bruvate dehacintak?h// Skanda was created by the glorious god, destroyer of the triple cities (Siva). That Grasper, bears another name, "Kum?ra." The one (i.e., the deity Kum?ra as opposed to the Grasper Kum?ra) who possesses (engages in) child's play, that god was born from Rudra and Agni. The glorious one (Kum?ra) cannot himself be occupied in improper conduct. Regarding this matter, because of Kum?ra's similarity to Skanda, physicians who have little knowledge, who have no learning whatsoever, declare: "He grasps." (Su Utt 37.8-10) The later commentator on the text, Dalhana, attempts to clarify the final statement by sug gesting that "Kum?ra" is K?rttikeya, the deity, while "Skanda" refers to a Grasper named Skanda (Su 336). The text argues that the deity and Grasper are not the same beings, and that only unintelligent people are confused by the similar names. I would suggest that the text tries to differentiate the two beings in the following manner: the god Skanda has multiple parentage, is a "kum?ra" in the sense of being a playful boy; he can be called "Guha," and he is innocent?he is not capable of acting like a Grasper. Skanda-graha, on the other hand, is created by one being, Siva, and is a Grasper. This Susrutasamhit? account is a unique case of splitting: there is no physical splitting in this account, but rather an argument for difference. The wording of the text until chapter 37 of the Uttaratantra does not suggest that a difference should be drawn between two figures called "Skanda." The split is introduced towards the end of the B?lagraha section after the Graspers have been described and the treatments for their attacks discussed. It comes as something of an "add-on" section of the text and may have been designed to accommodate the narratives of Skanda that emerge in other textual traditions. The absence in the Susru tasamhit? of an actual narrative of physical splitting, which other parts of the tradition seem to find so useful, may be accounted for by the genre of the text. While the epic and pur?nic texts engage in lengthy cycles of narratives, early ayurvedic texts like the Susru tasamhit? and the Carakasamhit? engage in a textbook-like instruction in disease causation and cure. While there are exceptions, the ayurvedic texts tend to avoid lengthy narratives and prefer arguments similar to what we find in chapter 37.43 43. The Susrutasamhit? also influenced other ayurvedic texts. Ast?hgahrdayasamhit? 3.1 describes a group of twelve Graspers, including Skanda-graha, who were created by Siva to protect (raks?rtham) Guha. The Ast?hga samgraha describes Skanda as a protector of children and the other Graspers as serving him. Once Skanda grows up he becomes their leader. Rudra then assigns them the role of attacking the children of those who do not honor deities and ancestors (Meulenbeld, History, 1A: 564). For more on the trajectory of ayurvedic texts in relation to B?lagrahas, see Filliozat, ?tude de d?monologie, 39-66.</page><page sequence="18">464 Journal of the American Oriental Society 121A (2007) The Susrutasamhit? then goes on to place the Grahas under the charge of Skanda, who in turn defers to Siva: tato bhagavati skande surasen?patau krte/ upatasthur grah?h sarve diptasaktidharam guham// ?cuh pr?ncalayas cainam vrttim nah samvidhatsva vai/ tes?m arthe tatah skandah sivam devam acodayat// Thus, when the blessed Skanda was made the general of the army of the gods, all the Graspers approached Guha, who holds a shimmering spear. Cowering and facing him they said: "Lay out a livelihood for us." Then Skanda asked the god Siva concerning their desire. (Su Utt 37.11-12) Siva then tells the Graspers that the triple world survives through mutual assistance. The gods help humans and animals by controlling the seasons and weather, while men please the gods through religious rites and correct conduct. The Graspers' mode of life will be to attack the children of those families that do not worship the gods and ancestors. Their live lihood will be in the form of p?j? offerings (Su Utt 37.14-20). The argument here is sig nificant. Siva suggests that there is a moral balance to the universe, and the role of the Grahas is to uphold that balance by punishing those who err.44 Skanda-deva is well removed from any blame in this account. He does not create the Graspers, and he does not assign the Graspers their role. He is depicted as an innocent child. While Siva and the other deities do create the Graspers, they do so initially to protect Skanda-deva; hence their intent was not malicious. Once Skanda is grown and becomes a divine general, we see a repeat of the moralizing theme. While the Graspers are mandated to commit terrible deeds, the blame for their attacks does not lie with the Graspers or Siva, but with the errant parents of the afflicted children. While the style of the Susrutasamhit? differs from the Mah?bh?rata accounts of splitting, the goal appears to be the same?a separation of Skanda-deva from the blame associated with disease causation. 6. THE CASE OF SKANDA IN THE K?SYAPASAMHIT? The K?syapasamhit? provides a final chronological step in these splitting narratives. In the two episodes below, Skanda, who is frequently called Guha in these accounts, embodies the split found in the Susrutasamhit?. While a Skanda-graha exists in the K?syapasamhit?, that figure is not the innocent and playful child Skanda-Guha. The narratives of splitting associated with Skanda-Guha in this text all function to create distance, like those of Skanda and Skand?pasm?ra, and they increasingly place the blame for disease on the moral status of the victim or the victim's parents. The K?syapasamhit? provides a wealth of information related to Kaum?rabhrtya, or the rearing and education of children. The primary focus of the text is childhood illnesses. The text is presented as a dialogue between Kasyapa and his student Vrddhajivaka. No extant manuscript of the text contains a complete version of the original, but enough of the text is available to get a reasonable understanding of the material.45 The text likely represents a later part of the ayurvedic tradition than the Susrutasamhit? and the Ast?hgahrdayasamhit?. Dating the text is extremely difficult, but a tentative but reasonable date of the seventh cen tury has been proposed by both Dominik Wujastyk and Jan Meulenbeld.46 The key chapter 44.

Wujastyk also notes that parts of the text may have been taken from earlier texts and that sections of the text employ archaic words that are only otherwise found in the Vedas and Br?hmanas. For more on the date of the text see Meulenbeld, History, 2A: 39-41.</page><page sequence="19">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 465 for us is the Cikitsitasth?na. This chapter is focused on diseases of pregnant women and contains a section on B?lagrahas, Child-snatchers. The B?lagraha section describes six female Grahas: Revat?, P?tan?, Andhap?tan?, Sitap?tan?, Katap?tan?, and Mukhamandik? (KS 66-73).47 While the B?lagraha section of the Cikitsitasth?na does not recognize the male Grahas we have seen thus far and, in particular, makes no reference to Skanda-graha, the text is not consistent in its lists of Grahas. An earlier section of the text, the Indriya sth?na, presents a series of prognostic dreams that indicate an impending attack by a Graha. That section lists the following Grahas: Skanda-graha 1.12, Skand?pasm?ra 1.15, Skandapitr 1.16, Paundarik? 1.17, Revat? 1.17, Suskarevat? 1.18, Sakuni 1.18, Mukhamandik? 1.20, P?tan? 1.21, and Naigames? 1.21. A lengthy list of Grahas is also given in the Reva tlkalpa section. The Revatlkalpa contains some remarkable accounts of Skanda and other figures not repeated elsewhere in the tradition, but there is not room to treat this material here.48 Of central importance to us, however, are the narratives connected to the creation of P?tan?49 and Mukhamandik?50 in the Cikitsitasth?na. The creation of P?tan? is part of a unique narrative that attempts to explain aspects of Skanda's mythology. In it a demon named Dundubhi attacks Skanda and then hides in a cave (guha) in Mount Krau?ca, which according to this text is the maternal uncle of Dundubhi. Skanda destroys the mountain and cave with his spear. Due to this violence, Skanda's appear ance is ruined. The gods, demons, lords of the directions, seas, rivers, great beings, and clouds come and fumigate the area in order to purify (p?ta) the place and Skanda. On the spot where the purification took place, P?tan?, who is described as "terrifying to all beings in all the worlds" (sarvalokabhayamkar?), appears (KS 69). Skanda instructs her to "enter those who are separated from the right way" (y?hi tvam bhinnamary?d?n) (KS 69). She agrees, and the text then describes the cure for an attack by her (KS 69). The story of P?tan? is an indirect splitting narrative. While the text does not explicitly state it, she appears to be the personification of Skanda's violence that disfigures him. In its treatment of P?tan?, the K?syapasamhit? follows a trend which begins in the Mah?bh?rata: Skanda is increasingly defined as a warrior deity and the existence of Grahas and their connection to Skanda is viewed as a challenge to his purity and status as a divine military figure?a challenge met with a splitting narrative. We also get some sense of how the tradition is shifting in the manner it treats the destruction of Krau?ca. Skanda is often called the destroyer of Krau?ca. We saw him in the Mah?bh?rata destroy Mount Krau?ca in an initial fit of violence aftfer his birth. In the epic text the destruction of this mountain was a pointless act of violence that seemed designed by Skanda to invoke fear. The K?syapasamhit? is part of the progressive redefinition of Skanda's character, which this essay partially traces. Unlike the Mah?bh?rata narrative that presents Skanda as a dangerous force of mindless violence and Krau?ca as an innocent victim, the K?syapasamhit? presents Krau?ca as part of a demonic lineage, as the uncle 47. The Cikitsitasth?na of the K?syapasamhit? is not well preserved and does not come with chapter and verse numbers. My references are to the page numbers found in the 1938 printed edition. 48. See K?syapasamhit?, Revatlkalpa, 153-67. Also see Wujastyk, Roots, 210-38, and Meulenbeld, History, 2A: 35. 49. P?tan? appears to have been an important female Graha, who appears in all of the texts mentioned in this essay: Mah?bh?rata 3.219.26-27; Susrutasamhit?, Uttaratantra 21 A, 27.12, 32.1-12; Ast?ngahrdayasamhit?, Uttarasth?na 3.2, 3.20. She is perhaps best known for her role in the cycle of stories connected to Krsna's infancy, an aspect of her mythology not mentioned in the texts cited here. 50. Mukhamandik? also appears as a female Graha in the texts used in this essay: Mah?bh?rata 3.219.29; Susrutasamhit?, Uttaratantra 27.5, 27.15, 35.1-10; Ast?ngahrdayasamhit?, Uttarasth?na 3.3, 3.26.</page><page sequence="20">466 Journal of the American Oriental Society 121A (2007) of Dundubhi, and as hiding that demon from Skanda. His death is a result of the necessary destruction of demons, Skanda's primary function as the general of the army of the gods. The actual creation of P?tan? is a side product of the main event. It is worth noting that P?tan? is not a conscious creation of Skanda. In the case of Skand?pasm?ra, Skanda maintained a taint of blame for childhood illnesses because he consciously made the Graha. Because the creation of P?tan? was not deliberate, Skanda escapes any hint that her creation might indi cate a malicious aspect of his character. She allows for a separation between Skanda and Grahas, as well as the impurity of his violent duty. Finally, she is described as subservient to Skanda. The birth story of Mukhamandik? follows a similar agenda. We are told that Skanda, just after his birth (j?tam?tra), was playing with various Ganas, Apsar?s, and Gandharvas in the presence of his parents, Um? and Siva. The text describes him as "adorned with flowers, decorations, perfumes and so on" (gandh?lamk?rapusp?dyair manday?m ?sa) (KS 71). The text then describes the various decorations on his face or faces: isukam citrakam c?sya lal?tacaksusi (vyadh?t)/ n?sik?gandacibukavaktre citravisesak?n// and an arrow-like mark was on his forehead and eye (and) various (other) marks were on his face, chin, cheeks, nose, eyes, and forehead. (KS 71)51 Skanda, who is more frequently called Guha in this section of the text, then childishly (b?la bh?va) asks his mother for the ornament found in Siva's mass of hair, the moon. He repeat edly tries to get the ornament, but is unable to do so. He is described as becoming enraged by this, though the text takes care to describe this temper tantrum as atypical behavior, because he is normally always playful or innocent (lalitah sada). In his anger he rubs off the deco rations from his face and throws them on the ground. This event shakes the three worlds, and even Siva and Um? are described as agitated enough to give the boy the moon. We are then told apaviddham tu yat krodh?t skandena mukhamandalam/ tato grahah s? babh?va d?run? mukhamandik?// nirdahisyann iva krodh?t tatas t?m abravld guhah/ annam kuru mah?bh?ge samklrn?k?rakarman?m// tath?stv iti ca s? pr?ha skandasya paric?rik?V evam mukh?rci(k?) jaj?e srnu tasy?s cikitsitam// That face that was thrown away by Skanda out of anger, it became the cruel Graha, Mukha mandik?. Guha, who was as though burning from anger, said to her, "O eminent one, you must make (your) food those whose appearances and actions are polluted." And that servant of Skanda said: "So be it." Thus Mukh?rcik? (Mukhamandik?) was born. Now hear of the cure for her. (KSll)52 As with the P?tan? story, the creation of Mukhamandik? is designed to separate Skanda from the anger and rage associated with these Grahas. While Skanda becomes angry in this account, the text softens his anger by presenting it as a child's tantrum and as aberrant behavior for the deity. Once Skanda's anger physically separates from him, it is no longer 51. The section which reads vyadh?t ('from piercing' or 'from cutting') is an addition made by the editor of the text, which I have left untranslated. 52. The (k?) was added by the editor.</page><page sequence="21">Mann: The Splitting of Skanda 467 his but a separate entity. Like P?tan? this Graha was not produced in a conscious manner; also like P?tan? she is under Skanda's charge and subservient to him. Finally, her attacks are attributed to a fault in the victim: Mukhamandik? does not attack randomly or out of anger, but instead to punish those who step out of line. The same is true of P?tan?. Both Skanda and his Grahas have become forces of moral retribution, which in effect places the blame for a Graha attack on the victim's parents.53 CONCLUSION As I have suggested throughout this paper, these narratives of splitting are about trans formation. One group of splitting narratives is designed to recast Skanda's character by sep arating him from disease causation. We also see a steady process of removing the deity from direct blame for illness, the blame being ultimately transferred to the victim's family. These various narratives illustrate one strategy used by the poets of the epic text to assimilate Skanda into their orthodox pantheon, a process that is paralleled by the ayurvedic tradition. The dramatic power of these re-characterizations in the case of Skanda can be seen in the second group of splitting narratives, about inclusion and assimilation. So complete is Skanda's transformation that these splitting narratives eventually are a means to assimilate once violent deities into Skanda's new personality. First, figures like Skanda-graha and Vis?kha-graha are disassociated from their connection to disease causation, and then they are assimilated to each other as a single figure. In the end the shift in personalities is so complete that texts like the Susrutasamhit? come to envision two separate Skandas, one a benign deity and the other a malignant cause of disease. In many ways these "splitting off" narratives of Skanda function in a similar manner as the "distancing narratives" of Siva explored by Phyllis Granoff.54 Both narrative traditions simultaneously create a physical distance between a deity and some physical action, and both traditions also use this genre of story as a means of spreading their cults through assimila tion. There are some differences between the two groups of stories, however. The Skanda narratives tend to be very physical. In the case of Vis?kha and the Kum?ras and Kum?ris, beings are quite literally blasted off of Skanda. Skanda has a distinct physical form in these epic and ayurvedic sources and that very physicality plays into his "splitting off" narratives. The physical presence of Skanda also relates to his role in physical action. While these nar ratives separate him from acting as a Graha, they also tend to display a new field of action for him as a warrior and military leader. As Granoff argues, part of the goal of the pur?nic distancing narratives in the case of Siva is to separate him from any physical action and to allow him to maintain a non-corporeal and more abstract form. While these two narrative traditions share a similar means, their ends are significantly different. I would suggest that these "ends" are crucial to our understanding of the different uses that these splitting and distancing narratives perform in the Saivite narrative tradition. As I have argued else where,55 the re-characterization of Skanda limits his eventual sphere of influence and his ritual cult. He stops being a feared and propitiated Graha and becomes a military figure; his end, so to speak, is as a god of war. Through these splitting narratives his realm of physical 53. Wujastyk ("Miscarriages of Justice," 256-75, and "Medical Demonology," 153-60) reaches a similar con clusion in his study of material from the ayurvedic tradition and some narratives from the K?syapasamhit? not discussed in this paper. I am grateful for Wujastyk's work in this area, which has helped to shape this paper. 54. Granoff, "Saving the Saviour," and "Siva and His Ganas." 55. Mann, "Early Cult," 82-84.</page><page sequence="22">468 Journal of the American Oriental Society 121A (2007) activity is limited to battle. Siva does not share this same limited end as a result of his dis tancing narratives. Siva rarely participates in direct violent physical action in the pur?nic accounts of him. As Granoff points out, he is typically presented as a non-corporeal ball of light.56 This inactivity, I would suggest, frees Siva from the limits of a specific role that some specific physical action might impose on his characterization. Saivites can claim of Siva that he is an ultimate divinity because he is capable of all actions through the divinities assimi lated into his cult. His amorphous form and indirect links to action allow for a more expan sive definition of who he is and what his realm of action encompasses. As I have implied above, we can account for these differing ends between the distancing narratives of Skanda and those of Siva if we appreciate the differing trajectories of the two cults. Siva developed into a preeminent deity in the Hindu tradition and Skanda did not.57 In the progression of Skanda's narratives, his cult was ultimately assimilated into Siva's. The ?ranyakaparvan seems well aware of the different trajectories of these two deities, where, as we have seen, Skanda acknowledges his subservience to Siva (MBh 3.220.13).58 Skanda also becomes one of Siva's "bodies," performing his will in the ?ranyakaparvan.59 The final scene in the ?ranyakaparvan's account of Skanda is his destruction of Mahisa, but that is a deed initially presented to Siva who consciously defers to Skanda. The text reads: tatah sa mahisah kruddhas t?rnam rudraratham yayau/ abhidrutya cajagr?ha rudrasya rathak?baram// yad? rudraratham kruddho mahisah sahas? gatahJ resat? rodasi g?dham mumuhus ca maharsayah// vyanadams ca mah?k?y? daity? jaladharopam?h/ ?sic ca niscitam tes?mjitam asm?bhir ity uta// tath?bh?te tu bhagav?n n?vadhln mahisam rane/ sasm?ra ca tad? skandam mrtyum tasya dur?tmanah// Then that fierce Mahisa quickly advanced on Rudra's chariot, and attacking him he seized Rudra's chariot pole. When the fierce Mahisa quickly approached Rudra's chariot, heaven and earth cried out mightily and the great sages were stupefied. The great-bodied demons who re sembled clouds roared, and they decided "victory is ours." But even in those circumstances, the lord did not kill Mahisa in battle, and he remembered that Skanda (was to be) the death of this wicked one. (MBh 3.221.57-60) Skanda will enter the scene and kill Mahisa to the great praise of Siva. The text, however, suggests that Siva could have killed the demon, but preferred to remain passive and pass the violent task to Skanda. Such an account is very similar to those studied by Granoff. In the ?ranyakaparvan, then, we witness two overlapping splitting narratives. One in volves a re-characterization of Skanda and the spread of his cult through the assimilation of other figures. The other illustrates the spread of Siva's cult through the assimilation of Skanda as his son, a narrative that is ultimately a form of distancing narrative. The ?ranyakaparvan''s 56. Granoff, "Siva and His Ganas." 57. This statement is really only accurate for the north Indian Sanskritic tradition; it cannot be said for the south Indian tradition of Murukan-Skanda, whose cult follows a different trajectory. 58. Here there is value in noting that the two other accounts of Skanda's birth from the Mah?bh?rata do not allow for the assimilation of Skanda's cult into Siva's. As we have already noted, in the Salyaparvan Skanda's par entage is left open. In the Anus?sanaparvan Siva is presented as one of Skanda's parents, but Agni is the supreme father of Skanda. 59.
