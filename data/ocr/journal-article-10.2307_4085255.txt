<plain_text><page sequence="1">Parent birds and their young.-Alexander F. Skutch. 1976. Austin, University of Texas Press. xviii + 503 pp. $2 7.50.-For more than four decades, Alexander F. Skutch has been a tireless and prolific student of the breeding habits of birds. His studies on the life histories of Central American species have been published in numerous books and in papers appearing in all the major ornithological journals. I think it is fair to say that were it not for Skutch's work and its influence on younger ornithologists, we would know next to nothing about the reproductive behavior of tropical New World birds. The enormousness of Skutch's contribution, most of it scattered in accounts of individual species, is such that no single work provides an adequate summary and synthesis. At last, Skutch himself has brought his lifetime work, together with an extensive survey of the world literature, into a single volume. As the title of Skutch's book, Parent Birds and their Offspring, suggests, it is about the diverse ways in which birds rear their young, beginning with preliminaries such as courtship, territorial defense, and nest building, and proceeding right through to the termination of parental care. One might wonder whether, with David Lack's recent (1968) synthesis, Ecological AdaptationsforBreeding in Birds (Methuen, London), another treatment of the subject could offer anything new. Surely it can, in this case, because Skutch and</page><page sequence="2">620 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 94 Lack have approached their subject from opposite directions, each providing a different perspective. David Lack, perhaps above all others, was responsible for raising the study of birds in their natural environments to the level of an experimental science, while Skutch has followed the rich tradition of 19th century naturalists. Lack, a keen observer in his own right, oriented his research around hypotheses concerning the regulation of bird populations. Skutch's role has been more that of a chronicler of the lives of birds. Unlike Lack, he has recorded many aspects of reproduction for which, at present, no theory exists. While Skutch discusses such traditional topics as the number of eggs birds lay in a clutch, patterns of incubation behavior, duration of parental care, and helpers at the nest, he also treats us to detailed summaries of the structure, building, and maintenance of nests, the hour of day at which eggs hatch, the male parent's discovery that the eggs in his nest have hatched, sanitation of the nest, the "education" of young birds, and the use of nests for sleeping. Indeed, Skutch has left little of the privacy of his subjects uninvaded. Parent Birds and their Offspring holds few surprises for us. Skutch has treated many of his topics in earlier papers and some of the chapters are little more than updated versions of these. The reader can be lulled by Skutch's familiar, easy style, provided he is comfortable with Skutch's exuberance for anthropomorphic expression. For example, Skutch tells us that "Singing may be in part an expression of loneliness, stress, or an unfilled need, as it often is in ourselves; when the male bird's need is filled and his loneliness overcome, he sings less," and, "Although I could not fathom the bird's feelings, to me it looked like a gesture of heartbroken despair." But it is not difficult to distinguish facts from interpretations in Skutch's writing because the latter appear to be an expression of style rather than scientific philosophy. At times, Skutch even catches himself. For example, in the course of defending a theory that ascribes to birds "a capacity to choose and an aesthetic sense," he suggests that "We need not suppose that the female bird who visits a courtship assembly deliberately assesses the qualifications of each claimant for her attention... We must conceive of her choice as more spontaneous...." Skutch places much of his discussion in the context of natural selection and evolution. Still, he clings to the utopian vision of animal behavior that characterized his earlier work, in which territoriality is a mechanism that adjusts the size of a population to the resources provided by the environment, and reproductive rate is adjusted by selection to balance adult mortality and thereby avoid the detrimental consequences of overpopulation. Although these views are untenable if one subscribes to the idea of individual selection, Skutch does not elaborate an alternative theoretical foundation for them. Having read many of Skutch's earlier writings, these shortcomings are predictable, but there were other disappointments as well, some trivial yet bothersome, some substantial. The quality of many of the photographs was poor, particularly compared to those published in contemporary books and periodicals. Many of the photographs do not adequately portray the points they were chosen to illustrate. The narrative frequently becomes a rambling list of facts and observations. Literature citations are sometimes lacking in the text where they would have been helpful. There are no chapter summaries, which would have been useful for quick reference. The book does, however, have an excellent index. I was convinced, after reading several chapters, that Skutch had not brought his subjects up to date. The chapters on helpers at the nest contain no discussion of kin-selection theory; Skutch does not mention recent papers on reproductive effort and the evolution of reproductive tactics; he plays down or ignores altogether much of the current thinking on territoriality and mating systems. But the lengthy bibliography of nearly 900 references proved otherwise. The number of papers cited per decade, beginning with 1900, progress from 2 to 10, 19, 47, 145 (40's), 263 (50's), 299 (60's), and 300 (70's, extrapolated from 3 years). Parent Birds and their Young seems out of date, not because recent literature has been ignored, but because of the type of paper cited. Skutch has remained an observer and his book summarizes observations, not ideas. His naturalist tradition also has not recorded the recent trend toward experimental studies of breeding behavior nor the interpretation of much of this behavior in terms of physiology, energetics, and demography. One wonders, then, can this book provide an adequate summary for the ornithologist and can it be helpful to the active researcher? As a summary, Parent Birds and their Young is irregular, al thorough on some topics as it is deficient on others. Skutch tries to bring together the literature on all birds, but tropical passerines clearly are his strong suit and others, particularly seabirds and raptors, are badly neglected. This book is not a rich source of ideas, either, and Skutch rarely illuminates the subtle points of theory. I would nonetheless recommend Parent Birds and their Young to all students of birds for the simple reason that it exemplifies, in many ways, the rich, but neglected tradition of observation and empiricism in natural science. We seem so intent upon testing hypotheses about nature that our understanding of her reaches only so far as our ability to conceptualize her motors and gears, a deficiency that might lead to a scientific discipline to stag- nation without the input of fresh observations. I subscribe to the hypothesis that reproductive rate is deter- mined largely by the resources available to breeding adults but, in his final chapter, "Regulation of the Rate</page><page sequence="3">July 1977] Reviews 621 of Reproduction," Skutch points to a dozen observations that cannot be explained adequately by the hypoth- esis as it is now formulated. How poorly we understand nature! And how little we shall learn unless we ac- cept nature as her own best teacher. Without doubt, Alexander Skutch has been one of her most astute pupils.-ROBERT E.
