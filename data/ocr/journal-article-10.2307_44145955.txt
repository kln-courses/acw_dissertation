<plain_text><page sequence="1">KASHMIR SMAST: AN ENIGMATIC SITE IN PAKISTAN Susmita Basu Majumdar Gandhara, the name brings in our mind a picture of either a Buddhist settlement or a cosmopolitan zone. The presence of brahminical ele- ments in the archaeological scenario of Gandhara was mainly brought to light by Nasim Khan, Peshawar University, Pakistan, with his con- tributions on Kashmir Smast, a unique Shaivite site. This site is lo- cated 1150 metre above sea level, about 50 kilometre northeast of Mardan in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan (Fig 1). This site has unfortunately been looted and destroyed by treasure hunters for many decades. Nasim Khan and his team has conducted excavations and detailed documentation of the objects found from this region since 1999 has been made available. The discovery of sculp- tures of gods and goddesses of the Brahminical pantheon, lingas, seals and inscriptions help us to formulate the idea of a Brahminical settle- ment within Gandhara, which is contrary to the previously held idea of the site being a Buddhist settlement. The earliest archaeological evidence pointing towards the predominance of the Shaivite elements in this zone of Gandhara dates back to 2nd century A.D and the latest to 10th century A.D.1 The archaeological data discovered from surface explorations, il- legal diggings and proper excavations have not only revealed the Shaiva face of Buddhist or cosmopolitan Gandhara, but has also led the present author to make an attempt to assess its importance in re- interpreting religious history and also identify mountain Munja vat men- tioned in the Vedas, Mahabharata and several other ancient texts with the mountain range of Kashmir Smast. More than two inscriptions refer to a mountain named Sri Minja and God Bhima or Shiva, the principal deity who resides in the cave Maha-guha of this mountain. Sri Minja probably is another form of Sri Munja or Munjavat / Munjavant / Mujavat. Gandhara is a later form of the name of the people called Gandhari in the Rig Veda2 and Atharva Veda. In the Atharva Veda the Gandharis are mentioned with the Mujavats, apparently as a despised people. In the Siddhanta Kaumudi3 on Panini we get another variant Maunjavata. According to some it was a hill from which the people took their name.4 Accord- ing to D.C. Sircar5 Mujavat were a distant people based on the evi- dence of Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda where they have been men-</page><page sequence="2">Archaeology 1399 tioned along with Mahavrsa, Gandhari and Balhika. The above data support the hypothesis of identifying mount Munjavat mentioned in the Mahabharata6 and other texts with Sri Minja mountain mentioned in the inscriptions (discovered from Kashmir Smast) and identify Munjavat with the mountains of Kashmir Smast region. However, this also shows that initially Kashmir Smast was not included in Gandhara. They were adjacent territories; later Mujavat or Munjavant was in- cluded within Gandhara.7 Kashmir Smast is so rich in antiquities that coins, pottery, lamps, arrows and spearheads, nails, grinding stones and other objects are found in surface explorations. Coins found from the site are of special interest; they range from the post Mauryan issues to Kalachuri coins of the 14th century A.D8. Among the numismatic evidences mention may be made to the post Mauryan coins of the three arched hill with a crescent on top and taurine symbol to its right on both obverse and reverse. Early Kushana coins of Kanishka I, Huvishka, Vasudeva I and Late Kushana coins of Kanishka II and Vasudeva II are also found along with Kushano- Sassanian coins of Peroz I, Hormizd II, Shahpur II, Peroz II and Hephthalite coins of the Bust/ Circle type and Bust / Fire Altar type and also the coins of the Hindu Shahis. Besides this, coins of other dynasties that never had control over this region are also found from this site. In this context special mention may be made of the coins of Western Kshatrapa rulers like Damasena, Rudrasimha and others and coins of the Kalachuris. Imitation coins of those of Menander have also been recovered from the site. Gandhara, being situated at the crossroads was an important trade centre. Traders from different parts of India and neighbouring regions visited this place for the purposes of trade. Besides, it also gained importance as a Buddhist religious centre and art of Gandhara espe- cially in this background flourished and reached the zenith of fame. It was trade due to which Gandhara became cosmopolitan, it not only adopted the art styles from the neighbouring regions but also extended warm welcome to people from various regions who came and settled in this area, possibly during which a Shaiva community settled in the foothills of Munjavat, where they made a temple of Shiva in the Maha- guha- a natural cave. This religious centre gradually gained impor- tance and monasteries were added to the main shrine. Possibly Shaiva ascetics and teachers might have resided in these monasteries and the coins that have been recovered from the site are offerings of the Brahminical or specifically Shaiva devotees who visited this place either in the course of their trade activities oras a place of pilgrimage.</page><page sequence="3">1400 IHC : Proceedings , 66th Session, 2005-06 The site has a huge cave referred to as Maha-guha in several in- scriptions, the abode of god Shiva. In one of the copper plate inscrip- tions it has also been named as Sita Maha-Kandara (same as Maha- guha) further it has also been mentioned that this great cave is situ- ated at the foot of the Mount Sri Minja ( sita-maha-kandara-sikhare Sriminja parvva(parvata)-maha guha nivasinya Bhimayah-pada-mule prayad-cha(chai)tya-Kshayanim. . ., i.e. the holy or pious Chaitya house of Bhima (the name of Shiva) at the foot of Mount Sri Minja.9 Further the inscription also furnishes a date in the lunar month, bright half of the 4th or 5th day of a month the name of which is illegible. On the basis of palaeography the inscription can be dated c. 5th Century A.D. An inscribed linga has been found from the site which bears triangle headed Brahmi characters which lead us to place the sculpture in be- tween 4th -6th century A.D. Another inscription in Sarada characters of 9th -12lh century A.D, refers to a person named Krishna or Krishnarati, who is referred to as rajaputra. The word Shivalokanam in this inscription again is important in the present context. Several other shrines and monastic establishments and a huge tank close to the maha-guha and many other water reservoirs have been found here. Principal deity of the Maha-guha, Shiva has been mentioned as Vardhamaneshvara or Bhima in inscriptions of this region. Shiva by the name of either Vardhamaneshvara or Bhima is otherwise not known earlier. Thus these inscriptions are of immense importance to a scholar of religious history. Describing the principal chamber and the neigh- bouring region Nasim Khan mentions "Inside the cave there are three main areas of interest: the first is a secret chamber situated at the distal end of the cave. It is not easily accessible as the passage leading to it is extremely steep and so narrow that one has to crawl to reach its entrance. The chamber itself is comparatively wide enough to turn easily.10 The second area of importance is a shrine which opens to the south and which is lightened by a window in the roof The central and front areas exhibit a water tank and small shrines which are now completely destroyed".11 Nasim Khan has read the name of the principal deity of the Maha- guha as Achima and identified the goddess as Lajja Gauri. He further mentions the Great Cave or Maha-guha as the earliest abode of god- dess Lajja Gauri on the basis of his reading (Achima) on seals, pots and a copper plate.12 However, there is no archaeological or literary evidence in support of the identification of the principal deity with Lajja Gauri; neither the name Achima elsewhere mentioned as Achiramaya is the name of the goddess. Moreover, the word Achiramaya means 'momentary illusion* which cannot be the name</page><page sequence="4">Archaeology 1401 of a goddess whose abode is a permanent Great cave or Maha-guha. It can be surmised with certainty that this principal deity was Shiva. Though few seals have been unearthed from the site which bear the figure of Lajja Gauri (datable to 2nd century A.D. and later) along with the attributes and figures of other gods like trisula representing Shiva, Kamandalu , an attribute of Shiva (which has been identified as purna ghata by Nasim Khan and he misinterprets it as a cognisance of Brahma) and a dancing figure (probably of Shiva). Critical analysis of the inscriptions reveals the flaw in the identification. This site being a Shaiva religious centre has several Shaiva shrines and Lajja Gauri is also associated with the same faith. However, Harry Falk does not agree with the reading of Nasim Khan and he reads "Acimayah" as Bhimayah.13 More or less this reading seems to be correct when we analyse the reading in the light of other inscriptions from this region. Furthermore, Nasim Khan himself states that the deity mentioned in the copper plate inscription is named Vardhamaneshvara and also Bhima in some places.14 The site prospered as a Shaiva religious centre which is proved by the fact that several inscriptions refer to Mathas or monasteries in this region attached to the main temple and there are references to dona- tions and religious offerings and feeding ceremonies (however there are no references to 'sattra' or free feeding house but one of the in- scriptions definitely refers to a mass feeding after the offering of food to God Vardhamaneshvara.15 Donors from far off places gave offer- ings at this pious pilgrimage is evident from the inscriptions. For ex- ample one of the inscriptions refers to a person hailing from the town of Devadharma ( devadharma nagara ), another refers to a person from Holama (Holamaysa nagara). Thus, Kashmir Smast, an enigmatic Shaiva site that flourished from at least 2nd century A. D to 10th century or even later, was popular and significant pilgrimage for people of the Shaiva faith in early India. The identification of Munjavat mentioned in ancient texts with the mountain range of Kashmir Smast region is of immense importance from the point of historical geography. However, detailed study of the inscriptions of this region, which the present author intends to pursue, will help scholars to understand the nature of the site and will add to our knowledge of Shaivism in ancient Indian context.</page><page sequence="5">1402 IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session , 2005-06 NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 .

Ibid, p. 2. Nasim Khan has wrongly read and translated it as " To Achima who dwells in the great secret place of the mount Sri Minja ( situated) at the end of the great Sita valley. At the foot of the mountain, a beautiful living place with tranquil water and a lively Chaitya." The meaning of the word Prayat is Holy or pious and Kshayah stands for a house and pada mule is at the foot of the mountain, which shows the incorrectness of the reading. However the inscription needs re-editing and the present author intends to re-edit and re-interpret this important inscription and is thankful to Nasim Khan who has kindly agreed to furnish good photographs of the inscription. 10. This reminds us of the difficult location of contemporary Shaiva and other Hindu religious centres like Amarnath and Vaishnodevi, etc., pilgrimage to which are very frequent inspite of their inconvenient locations. 1 1 .
