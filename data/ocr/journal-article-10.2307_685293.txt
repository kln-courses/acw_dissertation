<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE AND LOGIC: SOME THOUGHTS ON NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS* I FROM time to time it may be of value to engage in an analysis of the logical status of the concepts and laws of physics which are in current use and to investigate their logical and empirical foundations. In discussions of the foundations of mechanics and physics in general, Newton's Laws of Motion have a fairly prominent place. Though much attention has been paid to the First Law an investigation of the Second Law is not without interest, involving as it does a consideration of the related notions of force and mass. From our point of view, however, its chief interest lies in the fact that it illustrates a discussion of certain views concerning the basis of such laws which have been developed during the last seventy years. Two fairly well defined rival positions may be distinguished though there are of course plenty of intermediate ones. A review and criticism of these will help us to appreciate the kind of problem surrounding the relationship that holds between physical laws and their evidence. The didactic purpose of such a review will not be overlooked, and the discussion will proceed at an elementary level. Furthermore, the vectorial character of force will not be considered nor will Relativity be taken into account. We shall try to remain as closely as possible to simple experience. A fairly accurate translation of the Second Law of Motion as it occurs in Newton's Principia ' is as follows : 'The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.' In modern terminology this may be rendered: 'Rate of change of momentum is proportional to the unbalanced force and is in the direction of that force.' Choosing the usual units and ignoring Relativity effects the law simply becomes 'force = mass x acceleration.' Of the two main contrasting views affecting the logical status of this law the first holds that the law is an empirical generalisation about the * Received 27. ii. 51 1 F. Cajori, Sir Isaac Newton'sMathematical Principles, Cambridge, I934, p. 13 217</page><page sequence="2">G. BUCHDAHL result of a number of experimental situations involving well-defined relations between forces, masses and accelerations. In other words, there are definite empirical tests which would enable us to confirm or disconfirm the law. This view we shall call the synthetic or em- pirical view. The alternative doctrine maintains that the Second Law is not an empirical law but functions either as a definition (or con- tributory definition) of mass and/or force, or as an analytic statement prescribing the way in which motion is to be analysed. In the latter case such a law is sometimes spoken of as a convention or as a function- ally analytic proposition. This view we shall call the analytic view. The former was held by Newton and has been defended in some detail by C. D. Broad.x It is taken for granted in many traditional textbooks where elementary experiments are mentioned purporting to serve as tests for the law. The analytic view was held by Kirchhoff, made prominent by Poincar62 and has been discussed among others by Lindsay and Margenau3 and by A. Pap.4 It is not always clear to which camp a writer belongs. Thus Maxwell wrote: 'External or " impressed" force considered with reference to its effect-namely, the alteration of motions of bodies is completely defined and described in Newton's three laws of motion.' He then proceeds to a description of a series of empirical tests. Space forbids a thorough discussion of all the arguments. It will be sufficient to mention a few of them where relevant and we shall not attempt to demonstrate the ' correctness' of any one exclusively. Our method will rather be to make brief references to the reasons that have seemed to lead to a conclusion favouring one or the other side, to point out the similarities and differences between them, and to suggest some criticisms so as to prevent too hasty an adherence to any particular view. Such criticism is aimed at showing how either view depends upon a selective stress on certain features of scientific method to the exclusion of some others, and it is incidentally designed to prevent the deduction of certain metaphysical beliefs from the procedure of science. 1 C.

The locus classicus occurs in his Opticks:1 ' ... to derive two or three general principles of motion from phenomena, . . . would be a very great step in Philosophy . . .' There also, after telling us that the method of physics ought to consist in an analysis and subsequent synthesis, he continues : '... analysis consists in making experiments and observations and in drawing general conclusions from them by induction. . . .' (All italics mine.) These passages suggest that Newton never suspected that his laws were anything but generalisations from experience. Furthermore, in the Principia he distinguishes between definitions and laws. There- fore the Laws (or Axioms) of Motion are obviously not intended as definitions and there should be procedures which make a test, in principle at least, possible. (' In principle': because we are here not concerned with the practical possibility of an experiment; its theo- retical possibility is all that is required-we need only consider a 'thought-experiment.') One of the experiments often brought up involves the use of Atwood's machine. Essentially it amounts to the application of a force to certain masses and the measurement of the resulting accelera- tion. However, the force applied is a weight. We are therefore presupposing the identification of weight and force on the one hand and the proportionality of mass and weight on the other. From a logical point of view and that of the Principia this remains, however, to be demonstrated. The demonstration involves the Second Law itself. Now at this point adherents of the analytic view raise a powerful difficulty-generalising the result of this and many other similar experiments. To be meaningful, physical statements must contain terms which are measurable and defined independently of these statements themselves. And the trouble is that we do not appear to possess any means of measuring force and mass which do not at least seem to involve the Second Law itself (as well as certain other assump- tions and laws, e.g. First and Third Law of Motion.) This would then constitute one reason for adopting the analytic view. However, perhaps it may be possible to avoid this conclusion by looking more carefully at Newton's own procedure in the Principia. For there he has prefixed his laws by certain definitions of mass and force. Definition I 1 I. Newton, Opticks, Third edition, London, 1721, pp. 377, 380 219</page><page sequence="4">G. BUCHDAHL tells us that mass is to be measured as the product of volume and density. Definition IV reads : 'An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body, in order to change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line.' 1 A short modern rendering of this would be roughly: 'Force produces acceleration.' The analyst is not slow to notice certain objectionable features in these definitions. In contemporary physics 'density' is measured as the quotient of mass and volume. It is true that in Newton's time density and specific gravity were synonymous terms and that density was one of the fundamental units, the density of water being arbitrarily taken as unity. Nevertheless, the definition remains clearly objection- able. It does, however, draw attention to the fact that the concept of mass is complex and an experiment which we shall describe below will suggest that there may have been reasons for this particular analysis of mass. Definition IV looks similar to the Second Law and does not at first sight help to clarify the concept of force independently of it. Mach 2 goes so far as to say that it is 'wholly unnecessary tautology' after having established acceleration as the measure of force, to say again that change of motion is proportional to the force. It would have been enough to say that the definitions premised were not arbitrary mathematical ones, but correspond to properties of bodies experi- mentally given. In that case the function of the Second Law would be no more than that of converting a nominal into a real definition. However, the Second Law and Definition IV are clearly not identical. A careful comparison will persuade us of this. The definition is couched in qualitative terms. The law tells us that the force is directly proportional to mass times acceleration. In Definition IV Newton clearly did not mean to make any reference to momentum. There is thus something left to be discovered. (True, Definitions V to VIII do look very similar to the Second Law, but actually refer to centripetal forces only. And they obviously do not function as definitions proper but rather as reminders of unfamiliar technical usages of certain terms.) 1 F. Cajori, op. cit., p. 2-Cajori actually translates'..,. or of uniform motion in a right line.' Newton has 'vel movendi uniformiter in directum' and thus does not intend to introduce ' motion' (i.e. momentum, or mass X velocity) at this place. Cajori's translation slightly exaggerates the verbal similarity between the Second Law and Definition IV. 2 E. Mach, The Science of Mechanics, 5th English edition, La Salle, 1942, Ch. 2, sect. 7, p. 302 220</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE AND LOGIC The important thing about Definition IV, however, is that it summarises Newton's sweeping generalisation that forces determine accelerations. Acceleration is the fundamental aspect under which force is henceforth to be considered. The definition implies that it is possible to determine some circumstances in a complex situation in which a certain body (particle) is given a certain acceleration-this circumstance being called a force. Furthermore, this definition is fundamental; all others, for instance those of statics and engineering, become derivative within this system. And finally, the relative magnitude of the force is measured by this definition. Now once you assume this much by definition (whatever may have suggested its usefulness) the proposition 'force is proportional to acceleration' (which makes up part of the Second Law) is true by definition, i.e. can be turned into a tautology through replacing the term 'force' by its definition.' The proposition is analytic. Of course, as already mentioned, the Second Law introduces another term as well, namely mass. Nevertheless, at first sight it appears difficult to see how we could test the prediction that for a given force the product of mass and acceleration is constant if we have no other measure of force but that of acceleration. 3 All this certainly seems to provide a strong case for the adherents of the analytic view. And it seems to me that though Newton did not apparently realise it, supplementary considerations have to be introduced if the synthetic nature of the Second Law is even partially to be saved. To this end the believers in the synthetic view (the empiricists) sometimes attempt a defence through an enquiry into the meaning of force. Thus Broad 2 introduces a celebrated discussion of this problem by asking : 'What do we mean by force, and can we ever tell, apart from the laws of motion, whether forces are acting on a body or not ?' If the Second Law is a 'substantial statement' (i.e. synthetic), and not merely a definition of force, we must ' already know what we mean by force, and already have a method of measur- ing its magnitude and direction.' Broad then continues: It seems clear to me that no one ever does mean or ever has meant by 'force' rate of change of momentum. It is certain that the Second 1 We have here assumed that Definition IV implies a direct proportionality of ' force' and acceleration. 2 C. D. Broad, op. cit. pp. 161-62, 164 221</page><page sequence="6">G. BUCHDAHL Law, as originally stated, was not intended for a definition of force but for a substantial statement about it. Unquestionably the sensational basis of the scientific concept of force is the feelings of strain that we experience when we drag a heavy body along, or throw a stone, or bend a bow. The objection to this is, of course, that the concept of force thus viewed is purely anthropomorphic. Nonetheless it is quite possible that the concept may be based on felt strains and the like, though our original sensations are vague and not very dependable and most of the forces dealt with in mechanics are not of this kind at all. It is difficult to base a scientific measure of force on felt strains. Broad points out that the same holds, however, of other scientific concepts, e.g. that of temperature. Here we define certain methods of measure- ment which, whilst agreeing roughly with a sensational basis, are more accurate and admit of a wider field of application. We employ for this purpose a thermometer. But-to quote Professor Broad once more-' no one . .. imagines that what we mean by temperature is the height of a column of mercury.' I am afraid, however, that some people do mean just this. Thus Bridgman,x the official spokesman for the 'operationalist' theory of meaning or definition, writes '... just as the force concept was made more precise, so the temperature concept may be more or less divorced from its crude significance in terms of immediate sensation and be given a more precise meaning.' (Italics mine.) What seems here largely involved is a decision as to the meaning of meaning, or more specifically, as to whether there are to be preferred meanings. We may look at this matter perhaps somewhat more thoroughly. It will contribute towards greater clarity if we distinguish between a number of views that may be held about the meaning of force. (A) Radical Positivist View.-This maintains that the only fact represented by the idea of force is that of an acceleration given to a certain body together with certain laws of nature determining the way different accelerations may be compounded or resolved.2 On this view there is no sense in distinguishing between the proposition ' Force causes acceleration' and the proposition' Force is acceleration.' In more old-fashioned language we would say nothing 'real' corre- 1 P.W. Bridgman, The Logic of Modern Physics, New York, I947, Ch. III, p. II8 2 See, for instance, J. Buchler (ed.), The Philosophy of Peirce, London, 1940, Ch. 3, pP. 33-36 222</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE AND LOGIC sponds to the idea of force, or, the concept of force can be analysed without residue into certain observable spatio-temporal states of matter. In the solution of dynamical problems, for instance, the symbol for force is ultimately replaced by certain other variables, e.g. mass, length, and certain constants of nature. The hypothesis of a force which we use to understand such physical situations (unlike that of atoms and molecules) is not an hypothesis about the existence of anything but is an elliptical way of using certain propositions, e.g. the Second Law of Motion, to derive observable relations (Kepler's second law of planetary motion). (B) Moderate Positivist View.-This is similar to (A) but makes allowance for the empirical fact that forces may be measured by the behaviour of deformable bodies, for instance, as well as by accelerations. Here again, however, we are left with nothing other than correlations between the behaviour of an elastically deformable body and the dynamic behaviour of an accelerated particle. (C) Introspectionist View (sometimes called 'metaphysical ').-The Introspectionist adds another bit of background to our knowledge of force (or to the use of the term force), viz, direct experience through muscular sensations. It might be thought at first sight that this does not add much to the concept of force: there is no distinction in principle between physical events happening in muscles and the nerve-centres connected with them and in deformable bodies like springs. The doctrine, however, means more than that : it holds that introspection supplies us with direct knowledge of force being exerted on or by us. It is this piece of information which gives meaning to the assertion 'a force causes a certain physical event to happen,' since (so it is held) we are here aware of being directly acquainted with something (= our will; a decision to exert ourselves etc.) causing something else to change. This is not the place to enquire whether such evidence can be accepted as a basis for a causal argument-weighty objections have been raised against it since the time of Hume. The point is that the doctrine urges that this piece of knowledge or experience is at least sufficient to turn a sentence such as 'the application of a force is followed by an extension of a spring' from an analytic into a synthetic one. It implies that we have sometimes extraneous knowledge of the action of a force; in all other cases where we do not we may then assume hypothetically that something like a force is acting. The issue between views (A) and (B) on the one hand and (C) 223</page><page sequence="8">G. BUCHDAHL on the other would in that case boil down to something like this: Can we say a spring is subject to a force in cases where we do not ourselves apply a force (e.g. pull at the end of a suspended spring) ? Certainly it is true that the spring does not experience a force, since it is an inanimate body. However, it might still be subject to one ? But suppose the pull of my hand be replaced by that of a body suspended at the end of a spring balance-the spring being stretched as before. May we not infer that the body exerts a force in the required sense of that word ? Now certainly I cannot have direct experience of a force exerted by an inanimate body whilst that body replaces my hand. I can only infer it, and this in two ways, either deductively or in- ductively. (a) Deductively-To do this we should have to assume (as a definition) that a spring is stretched only by a force. This leads us back to the positivist doctrine. (b) Inductive-hypothetically.- This is certainly possible though somewhat queer. It is queer because it is obvious that our inference is not to the existence of a special sort of entity at all. We should never expect to observe this sort of force in the way in which we expect eventually to isolate and observe under a microscope a germ whose existence we have assumed to account for a certain disease. At the back of the whole argument, I suspect, lies a certain theory of causation. We seek for a mediator, a third term, an explanation, connecting' body suspended at the end of a spring-balance' with' stretched spring.' 1 We want to be able to say that the presence of the body is connected with something (a' force,' an 'action,' an invisible cause of some kind or other) which causes the spring to stretch. For these reasons it appears that it is largely a matter of choice- not affecting the facts as such-whether with the positivist you postulate that springs are only extended by what we call 'forces,' or whether you speak of an assumption of the existence of hypothetical forces. This fact explains why both views continue to retain their adherents. Newton himself combined uneasily the various positions which later become separated out. In Definition IV he is certainly not identifying force and acceleration. Force is there ' an action exerted' in order to change the velocity of a body. But at the end ofDefinition VIII he tells us that he is considering' forces not physically but mathe- matically,' he is not ' defining their kind or manner of action.' Here 1 I am not considering' gravitational fields,' etc. since this would only complicate the issue whilst not changing the essentials. 224</page><page sequence="9">SCIENCE AND LOGIC he seems to be groping after a more positivistic interpretation. I think he never quite managed to make up his mind as to the logical status of the concept of force. In Definition IV the anthropomorphic element of action is still present making allowance for our stubborn feeling that acceleration is only one of the many manifestations of force. Elsewhere a more positivistic element is present: there we are merely interested in supplying a way in which forces are to be measured. Broad, as we have seen, gives preference to the anthropomorphic aspect of force. It is true that in this case a law like the Second Law becomes substantial, but it also becomes correspondingly imprecise. It seems that the requirement of quantitative precision produces pro- gressively a demand for uniqueness of specification. It is the latter that involves us in difficulties which can clearly not be overcome by falling back upon the original imprecise and qualitative meaning of a concept. The two whilst genetically related are generically distinct. It is interesting to note that Broad, as a second alternative, does allow, though the Second Law is (as he holds) not a statement about what is meant by force, it may yet be one about' how force is to be measured for scientific purposes.' Here our decision will depend upon whether the only way of measuring force is to measure the rate of change of momentum. Now Broad seems to think that there is at least one other way. If true, this would enable us to look at the Second Law as a sort of physical hypothesis or generalisation. This is precisely how the law has been used. For instance, Newton treating the Second Law as an empirical hypothesis infers from his pendulum experiment that, since different masses have identical constant accelerations towards the earth's centre, a constant force is acting the magnitude of which is proportional to the masses of the bodies concerned. Now, unfortunately, Broad's example, designed to give an alternative measure- ment of force, involves again the identification of weight and force. It is, however, important not to assume this so that Newton's proof just mentioned may proceed. And this proof involves, as shown, the Second Law. What was required was a notion of force independent of and prior to the Second Law. 4 At this point it will be necessary to look more closely at the Second Law itself in order to see whether it does not contain sufficient synthetic features to make it at least plausible to have imagined that it is an P 225</page><page sequence="10">G. BUCHDAHL empirically testable statement. This would explain our stubborn feeling that this law is more than a mere arbitrary definition. So far we have seen that any plausibility attaching to the synthetic view depends in part upon decisions as to preferential meanings and in part upon the type of dynamical system within which our concepts are considered. To proceed, we remind ourselves that the First Law of Motion tells us what we are to understand by a 'free' particle, i.e. one not subject to any forces. Furthermore, we take Definition IV of the Principia to imply that fundamentally there is to be only one possible way of measuring forces. The method consists in assigning a numerical measure to any circumstance (' action ') resulting in a 'free' particle becoming accelerated, the number so assigned being specified by the acceleration of the corresponding particle. Dealing with 'free particles' implies absence of gravitational, magnetic, frictional or any other forces. It is difficult to reproduce situations where such con- ditions are satisfied. However, as Mach has reminded us, 'when experimenting in thought, it is permissible to modify unimportant circumstances in order to bring out the features in a given case.' As long as we are satisfied that the circumstances are unimportant the amount of idealisation implied is harmless. Moreover, the testing of every scientific law requires a certain amount of idealisation. Only, it must always be possible subsequently to discover whether the cir- cumstances omitted were unimportant. It is sometimes thought that the mere introduction ofabstraction and idealisation is sufficient to prove that a law is analytic. Such a view, however, would turn almost every scientific generalisation into a definition. The fact ofidealisation can therefore not be used as a criterion to distinguish between those laws which are plainly empirical and those which are not. And now to an experiment. As a standard model we picture a small rectangular body sliding upon a perfectly plane sheet of ice. The volume of the body v will have to be fairly small to approximate to an ideal mass-point. We now assume that this body may be 'pulled' by something, i.e. may be made to move with a certain acceleration which is to be constant. It is again assumed that the latter can be measured unambiguously. The body will then be subject to a certain force. That our body is subject to the application of a force has undoubtedly been suggested by the technical and sensational 1 E. Mach, op. cit. p. 34' 226</page><page sequence="11">SCIENCE AND LOGIC background of mechanics. Within Newton's system, however, we require nothing but Definition IV. Such conceptual purity would usually not be conducive to scientific advance. It is only important when we come to reflect upon the position of the concepts of a logical system once this has taken shape. Normally, it would of course be necessary to make use of many different kinds of definitions, some re- lated directly to sensory experience, and-at the other end-some arising within a theoretical system as relations between a number of constructs. We now require one more detail. Some method has to be devised through which to measure force otherwise than by acceleration. This will be necessary if we are to test the Second Law in a simple and straightforward experiment. According to this law, for a given acceleration, doubling the volume of a body entails doubling the force. As we saw, this proposition would be incapable of testing if force were merely measured as acceleration. Now it has usually been held that because Definition IV defines force in terms of acceleration we are for that reason prevented from proceeding at this point.' But it is obvious that no such thing is the case. Definition IV tells us when a force is acting. All we need is an alternative method to produce a measurable effect of such a force. We can then employ the numbers obtained by the use of the original definition to calibrate any other body affected by this force. An elastic thread or a spring will do. Although we already know that springs extend elastically under a pull, we need not presuppose this knowledge here; i.e. we need not presuppose that pushes and pulls are the same sort of force as used in dynamics. We merely discover this. In other words, the static employment of force is here derived from the kinetic definition. Of course, again a certain amount of idealisation enters. We assume perfect elasticity; furthermore, to each definite amount of force the spring will always assign one and only one definite number. Indeed, it may be said that all our method amounts to is to provide for a means of standardising the measurement of 'identical forces' independently of the accelerations they produce. We now imagine the following operations carried out. (a) Assume a certain homogeneous body of a certain material composition and a volume v1. (Subscripts refer to the experiment.) We assume that the material composition is relevant to the result, i.e. that a certain mechani- cal property will correspond to it which we shall designate by r x If the Second Law is taken to be a definition of mass a similar difficulty would arise here. 227</page><page sequence="12">G. BUCHDAHL (here rl). We now attach a spring to this body and apply a constant force f measured in the first place by a constant acceleration a1. The spring is found to extend to a position which we mark ex (the position prior to application of the force being marked e0). (b) We now increase the magnitude of the force to result in an acceleration a2, equal to say, 2a1. We mark the spring position e2, and to it will correspond a force f2 = 2f1, by definition. The sole object of all this is the calibration of the spring so as to supply us with a force scale which is henceforth measured by the extension numbers e%. Incidentally, however, we find that with the common type of elastic spring and for relatively low values off, e2 = zex. But the force appliedf2 = 2f1, as we saw. Hence we infer that the force applied is proportional to the extension of an elastic spring. This is equivalent to Hooke's Law which is here shown to be a consequence of our definition of force and an experiment. Per contra, if you assume Hooke's Law, the proposition 'force is proportional to acceleration' becomes empirical. This is often done in certain demonstrations of the Second Law and is, of course, objectionable from a systematic point of view. (c) We now return to an experimental consideration of mass. We shall not explicitly introduce the Third Law of Motion (' To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction') though we shall have to see subsequently whether this law is not presupposed implicitly in our experiment.' Newton, as has been mentioned, defined mass as the product of volume and density. As yet, however, we have no means of measuring density though undoubtedly it refers to some property of the body other than its spatial extension (volume). We have denoted this property by r and hence may write the Second Law in the form f= r. v. a, assuming the usual units. It is in this form we proceed to test it. We halve the volume of our test body, i.e. v3 = vi/2. We apply a forcef3 = fl, say, all such forces now to be measured by our previously calibrated spring. Experimentally we find that a3 = 2ax. This part of the Second Law is thus empirical. (d) We now take another body assumed to be of a different material constitution whose volume v4 we make equal to vx. We apply to it a force f4 = fl. We then find an acceleration a4 = a/2, say. This suggests, on looking at the formula f= r. v. a, that r 1 Since Newton treated his three Laws as' Axioms' presumably he thought that they were independent of one another. 228</page><page sequence="13">SCIENCE AND LOGIC is some definitive property given by some experiment like the one just performed. Also, we infer that r,= 2zrx. We can then build up a coherent series of measurements in conformity with our formula. For instance, if we proceed to halve the volume of the body whose 'density' r = r4, we again find that with a force f= f- the accelera- tion is now doubled, and so on. Our formula is, then, confirmed once again. But there is a difference between the third and fourth experiment and the conclusions derived. The third experiment showed that-on application of the same force-halving the volume causes doubling of the acceleration. In this instance, however, we possessed an independent means of measuring the volume of our test body. This is not the case in the fourth experiment. There are no ways, independent of the formula f = r. v. a, of measuring densities by elementary mechanical pro- cedures. On the contrary, it is by means of an experiment like the fourth that one assigns numbers to densities (treating density as an inertial property). Undoubtedly the experiment enables us to discover that bodies of apparently different material constitution (as suggested by chemical or visual and tactual tests) possess different densities. But the direct proportionality of density to force is assigned by the Second Law and not proved inductively. The assignment of density numbers of course leads to a coherent series of values, i.e. for each density value the relationship holding between force, volume and acceleration of a body can be tested. The Second Law thus acts as a schema for the assignment of relative density numbers and thus indirectly of mass numbers. S The introduction of the properties of elastic bodies has of course been advocated before for the purpose of testing the Second Law, e.g. by such writers as Maxwell, Bridgman and Lenzen.1 A celebrated effort in this direction was made by Andrade, in his 'Legons de mechanique physique'-well known because of its discussion by Poincar6.2 Poincar6 raises several objections all with the purpose of proving that our law must be analytic. Not all forces are transmitted by threads and, moreover, to make them comparable they would have to be transmitted by identical threads. Nor are threads without mass and removed from all other forces. None of these appear to me to x V. F. Lenzen, The Nature of Physical Theory, New York, I93I, Ch. 5 2 H. Poincar6, op. cit. p. 104 f. 229</page><page sequence="14">G. BUCHDAHL be objections as such if you allow at all the possibility of an experi- mental test of any law. To take the last objection first. We meet here again the complaint that idealised conditions are never met with in nature. We have dealt with this before. As for the first objection the concepts which are needed to formulate a scientific law are always general. A concept like temperature is not only a generalisation covering a number of measurements with mercury thermometers but also with platinum resistance thermometers and so on. Lindsay and Margenau,1 for a similar reason, object to the possi- bility of measuring forces by means of pushes and pulls. A push 'is always applied through a physical medium, and any attempt to measure it will have to be made in terms of the observed properties of such media. Since media differ widely, this is . . . not satisfactory. Surely we want a definition which is ultimately independent of the properties of special media.' Now the question of definition of our major physical concepts is indeed a matter about which it is difficult to see clearly. It is certainly true that the history of physics bears witness to the attempt to arrive at ever more general definitions, i.e. those which define concepts by means of the most general laws. Thus temperature may be defined by the use of the expansive properties of metals or liquids. Subsequently we use the properties of gases that appear to be more 'ideally' suited for this purpose. A still later definition emerges as a consequence of the application of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is precisely for these reasons that some writers have felt that the operational method of scientific definitions is in- sufficient since it leaves the basis of the physical concept too narrow. As mentioned, an important concept usually requires more than one definition, and some of these will involve theoretical relations of a fairly general kind.2 Yet all relations (i.e. laws) so employed are still ultimately empirical, however general they may be. They describe the behaviour of physical systems. The reference to ' special media' in your definitional statement can therefore never be an ultimate objection. It is a matter of practicality, not of principle. Poincar6's objection involving the claim that we ought to use identical threads may be disposed of in a similar manner. Although we did actually imagine the use of one spring only it would in fact 1 Lindsay and Margenau, op. cit. p. 91 2 Cf. H. Margenau, The Nature of Physical Reality, New York, I95so, Ch 12, p. 232 if.: 'Constitutive vs. Epistemic Definitions' 23o</page><page sequence="15">SCIENCE AND LOGIC hardly matter if we had used several, provided we had first sub- jected them to the usual tests for similarity of performance. No more could be expected. Every scientific law implies a generalisation of performance, an extension over a field wider than that which provides its testing ground. All these strictures imply an ideal of metaphysical purity contradicting the very spirit of scientific procedure. Poincar6 does make them presumably in order to indicate that the Second Law is analytic. But they can hardly count as reasons though they may have acted as causes for Poincar6's view. The only reason we have found so far for calling it analytic is that it does employ a restricted definition of force and serves to assign relative density numbers. At the same time we have also noticed that it is possible to put parts of the law to an empirical test. Before completing the discussion by extending these reflections, there is one last rather more powerful objection of Poincar6's which we must look at. To quote: But after all, what have we done ? We have defined the force to which the thread is subjected by the deformation undergone by this thread, which is reasonable enough; we have further assumed that if a body is attached to this thread, the effort transmitted to it by the thread is equal to the action this body exercises on this thread; after all, we have therefore used the principle of the equality of action and reaction, in considering it not as an experimental truth, but as the very definition of force.1 The strength of this objection, if justified, is this. We want to discover how much in the law is synthetic, how much analytic. By way of example; we could have assumed Hooke's Law as a definition of force in which case the part of the law which at present rests on the assumption (definition) that force is proportional to acceleration would have become synthetic. We reject Hooke's Law as an assumption because we want to separate statics from kinetics. We also want to discover how far an independent verification of the Second Law is possible. The discovery that we presuppose the Third Law of Motion would not involve a mixture of statics and dynamics but it would show that a possibility of an independent verification was lessened. Whether this would also show that the law was analytic would depend upon whether the Third Law itself were synthetic and independent. The need for assumptions as such is, of course, irrelevant to the issue, except for showing that Newton's 'Axioms' are not independent, and hence not axioms in the technical sense. 1 H. Poincard, op. cit. p. lO5 23I</page><page sequence="16">G. BUCHDAHL On the other hand, I am not certain whether Poincar6's objection need be accepted at all. Surely it is possible to consider one side of a force transaction at a time ! What we are considering in the Second Law are not internal stresses but the effects of external forces. It is true, you may say, that it is assumed the force registered by the spring is the force transmitted, i.e. applied to the body. But in doing this I do not, so far, have to consider the reaction of the body upon the spring at all. 6 I conclude that our thought-experiment may be allowed to stand as a possible attempt to disentangle the rational and empirical features of the Second Law. Our experiment certainly does show that the law is not completely verifiable in the ordinary way. The force term in it can only be numerically specified given the defining characteristic of force, namely acceleration. This much Newton realised. Furthermore we have to introduce a derivative method (elastic deformations) to make sense of the experimental basis. This, whilst not explicitly mentioned by Newton, does not seem to involve a vicious circle as is sometimes supposed. Finally, the law acts as a schema in terms of which density may be given quantitative expression. On the other hand, it is an empirical fact that different bodies have different densities; and that for bodies of similar den- sities, equal forces produce accelerations inversely proportional to their volumes (cf. experiment (c) above). It will be agreed, then, that the Second Law is hardly a straight- forward definition. Nor is it simply true by definition. But at times the fact that it is not synthetic in a straightforward way has led some writers to call it a convention. (Its employ- ment for the assignment of density numbers may strengthen such an idea.) It seems indeed peculiar to speak of convention in this connection at all. It is a convention to employ the symbol j for the first derivative of y with respect to the time variable. Or to take a slightly less clear-cut case, it is by convention that most statisticians work on a basis that a deviation of a mean of a sample from that of a normal population from which it is taken, which is greater than twice the standard error is significant. There are no doubt good reasons for agreeing to choose this limit of significance. But it would be perverse to speak of testing such a convention; and even perverse to ask whether the convention was in accordance with the facts-though it has 232</page><page sequence="17">SCIENCE AND LOGIC its uses. The classical statement for the conventional doctrine is to be found in Poincar6, and it may be interesting to quote some of the things he says, because his views have been very influential. We see at the start a very particular and in sum rather crude experiment; at the finish, a law perfectly general, perfectly precise, the certainty of which we regard as absolute. This certainty we ourselves have be- stowed upon it voluntarily, so to speak, by looking upon it as a con- vention. Are the laws of acceleration . ..(etc.) . . then only arbitrary conventions ? Convention, yes; arbitrary, no; they would be if we lost sight of the experiments which led the creators of the science to adopt them, and which, imperfect as they may be, suffice to justify them ... 1 It is here implicitly admitted that there are experiments to back up the conventions. Furthermore, the only reasons for speaking of conventions at this place is that 'we regard (the laws) as absolute,' that we 'bestow certainty upon them.' It is not quite clear what this means. It may mean that the law is only approximately verified in nature. Or it may imply that we, on the basis of a few experiments, decide to use the law on other similar occasions also ; or that we shall employ it on occasions which differ significantly as an hypothesis. (Thus Newton infers the existence of central forces from Kepler's second law-inter alia-by means of assuming the First and Second Laws of Motion.) It may mean that we have decided to retain the law even in the face of contradictory experience, for instance where necessary by the introduction of hidden masses. All this, however, is only a matter of degree. We do not invest a law as such with additional strength merely by virtue of a decision. It looks as though all we have done is to convert the complaints mentioned before into a positive demand that the laws must be more than mere empirical generalisation of approximate value. However, the introduction of the term con- vention has the tendency to suggest a certain degree of petrification which arises out of the attempts to systematise scientific experience. Now the Second Law does actually function as one of the major axioms of classical dynamics. It is then understandable that we should try to reinforce its axiomatic character, its strength. Behind this lies a doubt connected with the difficulty of justifying inductive methods of proof and as its converse the ideal to exhibit the major principles of physics as necessary propositions. This is not the place to investigate 1 H. Poincard, op. cit. p. io6 233</page><page sequence="18">G. BUCHDAHL such questions in general 1 but only the versions based on arguments discussed in this paper. (Nor should the latter be confused with quite a different doctrine of Eddington's which attempts to base the major principles of physics on-what he called--' epistemological a priori' propositions.) In general, a closer inspection of the arguments that we have found adduced in favour of both the synthetic and the analytic views shows that the differences do not lie so much in the nature of the facts studied, but in differences of stress and emphasis placed on different aspects of the situation. The conclusions are arrived at so as to satisfy certain external claims, certain ideals of scientific method and knowledge. Thus we have found Broad stressing a particular pre-scientific meaning of force in order to turn the Second Law into a synthetic proposition. He wants it to be synthetic because this type of proposition is the only one reporting straightforwardly matters of fact and is thus closely linked with empirical reality. On the other hand, the ideal of precision and uniqueness of specification has the effect of turning the law into an analytic proposition. Similarly the attempt to avoid reference to special media in the definition of a scientific concept causes us to look for expressions of the greatest possible generality, and quite generally the demand for certainty leads us to regard important physical laws as conventions.2 So at one end we have the empirical basis or test. At the other a perfectly general law' the certainty of which we regard as absolute.' The choice is ours. The empiricist will stress the concrete foundations of the law and continue to look at it as an hypothesis when using it beyond its foundations. The rationalist will stress the gap that divides the limited foundation from the universal result. Hle will therefore speak of the empirical basis as an exemplification rather than an inductive 1 Cf. G. Buchdahl, 'Induction and Scientific Method,' Mind, Edinburgh, I95r, 60, 16 2 For certain purposes it would be necessary to distinguish more clearly between 'conventions' and analytic propositions. The latter are true because of the de- finitions of the concepts employed in their formulation. The former are true in virtue of public decisions. Similarly we should have to distinguish between analytic and a priori propositions. The latter are true not because ofa chosen definition nor of a decision but because the evidence for their truth is not based upon external ex- perience. It arises from some other 'necessity '-either of some intellectual in- tuition or of our thinking in general. A certain amount of confusion has been introduced by calling analytic propositions and conventions 'functional a priori' propositions. 234</page><page sequence="19">SCIENCE AND LOGIC proof of a law, whose certainty must be regarded as absolute. He will turn the experimental truth into a definition. His justification for doing so is, however, still the usefulness of the definition. It is, there- fore, not quite clear how much is in fact gained by the reformulation of logical terminology. The ambiguous nature of the empirical veri- fication of the Second Law produces the conflict to an extreme degree and this explains the recurrence of the opposing views considered. It is in fact the same sort of conflict that we have found to lie at the bottom of the opposing doctrines about the meaning (nature) of force itself which was discussed above. In conclusion, we find that it is misleading to speak of the search for reasons which would prove the correctness of either the empirical or the rationalist viewpoint in borderline cases such as the one here considered. For certain purposes, for instance, some laws such as Boyle's Law are clearly synthetic, and a principle like the First Law of Motion, or the principle that 'Absolute motion cannot be observed' have clearly an analytic use. Notwithstanding this, Boyle's Law may be regarded as part of the definition of an ideal gas ; and the principle of the observability of absolute motion has been thought to be testable inductively by the Michelson-Morley experiment. Conflict perhaps only arises where we attempt to reconcile the different ways in which certain scientific statements function, and where we try to use any particular way to prove the truth of some logical (or metaphysical) view conclusively.
