This terminology seems even more misplaced because it appears to work against  ramaswamy’s larger argument which renders these artisans as sophisticated and  clever subversives, reconfiguring visually what was initially an implement of domi- nation. As she explains, “undoubtedly the barefoot is in contested intimacy with  command cartography, as it dislodges the state’s highly invested map form from  official contexts of production and use and then reembeds it—sometimes to the  point of only faint resemblance—in its own pictorial productions . . . after the fash- ion of so much else in colonial india where the artifacts of empire and science  were simultaneously disavowed and desired, patriotic popular mapmaking takes  on the cartographed form of the nation but also pushes it in directions not intended  for it by either science or state” (35). Thus, might we not conceive of the indian  anthropomorphic-sacred supplement to the attempted colonial commandeering of  the  cartography of india as a brilliant and complex act of resistance to colonial  domination? in a sense, indian artisans acknowledge the colonial interpretation of the car- tography of india in sterile straight lines and grids but refuse to accept it as con- veying the entirety of the nation. instead, like many aspects of hindu religiosity  throughout history, they respond to challenging (and even aggressive) extra-hindu  ideas by appropriating and incorporating them, even substantively altering them to  accommodate them within a hindu worldview. These nationalistic artisans trans- form the sterile product of enlightenment rationality and geographical science (the  cartographic map) into a wholly indian (and predominantly Hindu—another point  that might warrant a more aggressive analysis in the text) symbol of loyalty and  patriotism emboldened by the “feminine” characteristics of love, self-sacrifice, and  service. Perhaps “barefoot” is not the best term to describe those who would ad- ministrate such a careful, clever, political, and above all calculated move with such  extensive historical precedent. amaNda huffer Austin College The Ten Lost Tribes: A World History. By Zvi Ben-dor Benite. oxford and new  york: oxford University Press, 2009. Pp. ix+302, $29.95 (cloth). The aim of the Zvi Ben-dor Benite’s book is to discuss narrative portrayals of the  ten lost tribes of israel, from the book of isaiah to the Book of mormon. Chapter 1  describes the historical background of biblical times. Chapter 2 discusses the legend  of the lost tribes in iV ezra (The vision of ezra) and sambatyon. Chapter 3 is called  “Tricksters and Travels” and tells the story of eldad the danite (883 Ce), Prester  John, and Benjamin of Tudela. Chapter 4 discusses stories about david hareuveni  (ca. 1524) (often mistakenly called reuveni) and related stories from the sixteenth  century. Chapter 5, “Concordia mundi,” describes how european scholars and trav- elers looked for the tribes in seventeenth-century America. Chapter 6 is entitled  “hopes of israel” (named after r. menashe ben israel’s book) and discusses Jews’  </page> <page sequence="2"> History of Religions 189 and non-Jews’ ideas concerning the lost tribes in the seventeenth through nineteenth  centuries. The text ends with a long chapter entitled “Conclusion: To find the Ten  lost Tribes” (199–226), although it is not easy to discern in what way this chapter  is a concluding remark. The end includes a rich bibliography of several hundred  related books and papers. This book suffers from several problems, and it is not easy to determine what  its main failure is. let us begin with the fact that Zvi Ben-dor Benite is retelling a  well-known story: the shelves of libraries are loaded with books on the lost tribes,  so the necessity of another book dedicated to the same topic is far from clear. it is  true that this book covers more locations and people, and it is written in a more  systematic method than its predecessors. however, the book is just more of the  same. now that we know more details about how the Japanese or the Aztecs were  considered lost tribes, we cannot but think of the modern internet that brings forth  everything on anything. This virtual library is getting better by the day, so it is not  clear why a young scholar, instead of making a new path in the scholarly jungle,  prefers to rewrite others’ stories. A second problem lies in the aim of the author. on the one hand he attempts to  describe centuries of people searching for lost tribes, so it is a scholarly work done  systematically. on the other hand, whenever the author discusses his subject it is  not clear whether he writes fact or fiction. instead of telling the reader how to move  from fiction (or legend) to reality, he writes both: fiction and reality combined. The  way the author pours data before the reader makes the differentiation between reality  and fiction foggy. from the very beginning it is not clear if the book aims to gather  folkloristic accounts and analyze them accordingly in a scientific method or if its  aim is to promote unscholarly imagination, blurring the subjects with centuries-old  books of fantasies. Ben-dor Benite works with myth-telling, but it is not clear if he  is an observer or a practitioner. he is aware of his problem at times (for example, on  p. 104), but this does not lead him to clarify the point through citing state-of-the-art  scholarly papers. This becomes evident when one looks at the way he mishandles  the Prester John legend: the discussion ignores some of its literature and neglects to  tell the reader that it is clear today that he came from southern india (since Calicut  is mentioned as his vicinity, and for several more reasons), and not from ethiopia. 1  instead of scholarly works, the author quotes modern fantasies and makes them  appear as if they are learned research, hence staining knowledge with fairy tales.  As another example, on page 88, the chief rabbi of south Africa is made to tell us  where eldad the danite came from. here we come to a third problem that is, in a way, the worst: Ben-dor Benite  relies on pseudo-scholars, that is, journalists disguised as professors (from Parfitt  to shahan, from rabbi Avichail to halkin), and people who have never published a  paper in a scholarly journal (and when they did publish their own books they were  harshly criticized). in doing so, the author undermines his own efforts, good and  scholarly as they might intend to be. When Ben-dor Benite echoes noise as true  voices he shows weak critical faculties. it is evident from the book that the author  was trained to be a scholar when he commands unknown books (in many languages)  1 meir Bar-ilan, “Prester John: fiction and history,” History of European Ideas 20, nos.  1–3 (1995): 291–98. </page> <page sequence="3"> 190 Book Reviews of unknown lands. moreover, Ben-dor Benite reveals knowledge about almost any  aspect of history, except Jewish history of the last millennium. Quoting Arab as  well as french historians is very good, indeed, but since the subject is a Jewish  one, one is surprised to find him unaware of Jewish-authored historiography. Thus,  the historians who would presumably be the most competent to discuss unknown  Jews in unknown lands are missing from the work, while incompetent writers are  presented in abundance. This is why the comprehensive bibliography is misleading:  a mere collection of a well-searched field’s bibliography does not reflect critical  discrimination. Walter fischel is not mentioned and yitzhak Ben-Zvi (former president of the  state of israel) is mentioned only to dismiss him in a dubious statement (220–22).  on the other hand, books of the third rank are mentioned and admired. eisenstein’s  collected itinerary book is not mentioned, 2 and, even more surprising, kaifeng Jews  (close to the very focus of the writer’s former book) get no special attention. Jews  from Cochin that claim they arrived there because of shalmanesser, a testimony  already known for centuries, 3 are missing too. i was disappointed in the minor (or  minimized) role of the hebrew bibliography, which is more than questionable (mis- spelling was found only once, in the hebrew book mentioned on 262). 4 mircea  eliade once said that if one wants to study religions he should command his own  religion first, and this should be applied to literature as well. it should be stated that these failures not only denote one scholar’s work, but  rather they expose the state of the art of modern scholarship, since the book was not  written in an academic vacuum. knowing that adventure stories were successful  already at the time of incunabula, one wonders whether an academic press in the  twenty-first-century is dreaming of making money more than it was used to in the  twentieth century, but i leave this question open. in a way, this book is challeng- ing what scholarship should or should not be: could it be that a book with a broad  bibliography is not a scholarly book? Could it be that two professors in two differ- ent universities recommended a book on the back cover while a third person (this  reviewer) thinks that they are totally mistaken? Zvi Ben-dor Benite indulges every fantasy and scours rare-books collections but  forgets that an armchair traveler must begin his journey not only with erudition.  romantic historiography, combined with an uncritical mind, goes together with  scholarship of languages and people that seems to belong to the nineteenth century,  certainly not a contribution to twenty-first-century scholarship. in a way, Ben-dor  Benite is a victim of being unaware of the fact that the world is wide and in it there  are many nonscholars who pretend to be scholars. relying on them is like traveling  in unknown lands while relying on unauthoritative guides. Being naïve is inexcus- able in scholarship as it is in the real world.

By Colleen m. Conway.  new york: oxford University Press, 2008. Pp. xii+254. $65.00 (cloth). men are dead. long live men. The feature article in the July/August 2010 issue  of The Atlantic, “The end of men,” by hannah rosin, describes the demise of the  male sex in the economy and society of the postindustrial age. one telling anecdote  involves an adult education class in kansas City: in front of a classroom of unem- ployed men, the teacher discusses the income of a “typical” heterosexual household:  “her salary” ($85,000) and “your salary” ($12,000). “That’s right,” the teacher says.  “she’s the man.” statistics reinforce the point: of fifteen “likely growth” career  categories, only “computer engineers” and “janitors” remain predominantly y-chro- mosomal. even for the present reviewer—who likes to think that he has an ironic  sense of his own masculinity—“The end of men” is disquieting. What else to call it but a crisis of manhood? if so, it seems that we are living  through one in a long line of such crises. in the introduction to her ambitious and  thoughtful book, Behold the Man, Colleen Conway enumerates the trouble spots  on the timeline of the United states: “in the post-revolutionary period, the ante- bellum period, the Civil War, after the Civil War, the early twentieth century, the  depression, the two World Wars, and so on at seemingly every stage of American  history—studies find that men faced a ‘crisis of masculinity’” (10). Confronted by  such a list, skepticism is understandable: if there’s always a crisis, then there’s never  a crisis. A more subtle interpretation, and one that Conway seems to favor, is that  rhetoric about “threats to manliness” forms an essential part of the construction of  manhood. masculinity, like other props of the Western self, is both incredibly potent  and chronically fragile, as one generation passes on to the next a double helping of  machismo and anxiety. it comes as no surprise, then, to learn that ancient males suffered from gender  trouble in equal measure to their modern brethren. Conway’s goal is to interpret  early Christian writings, mainly from the Christian new Testament, in the context  of ancient understandings of masculinity. The approach of Behold the Man belongs  to cultural studies; it explores representations of masculinity, not the actual lives of  ancient men. readers should not expect to find a proposal about the historical Jesus.  rather, Conway’s starting point is the “hegemonic masculinity” of the “greco- roman world” (8–12). much of what we encounter under this heading in chapters 2  and 3 sounds familiar. here Conway describes the long-standing “manly” virtues of  courage and mastery, with illustrations drawn from moralists such as Plutarch and  Philo and the literary lives of figures such as Augustus and Apollonius of Tyana.  </page> </plain_text>
