<plain_text><page sequence="1">Early Visigothic Christianity In the following pages I propose to discuss (I) the fourth-century persecutions, (II) the circumstances of the conversion, (III) Visi- gothic ecclesiastical organization, (IV) some aspects of Ulfila's achievement, (V) the works of the Arian bishop Maximinus, practically the only books which enable us to gain some insight into the character of Visigothic Christianity, and (VI) general reflections on the conversion of the barbarians. For the first three quarters of the fourth century the Visigoths lived in what is now approximately Rumania. In 369, the year in which the Emperor Valens successfully invaded their country, they began a fierce persecution of the Christians who lived among them, a persecution which lasted with intervals of peace until 372. This was the second Visigothic persecution of which we know, for Ulfila and some of his followers had been persecuted and driven from Gothia in 347-8. But in 376 the entire people were driven from their country by the Huns and were admitted to the Roman provinces. They defeated and killed Valens at Adrianople in 378 ; but Valens' successor Theodosius I managed to split the leaders of the victorious barbarians into two factions, one of which, led by Fravittas, wished to reach an accommod- ation with the Romans, while the other, led by Eriulf, favoured continued hostilities. The tension between these two parties became so extreme that Fravittas murdered Eriulf with his own hands, and then with his followers deserted Visigothic society altogether and joined the Romans. At length by a treaty signed on 3 October 382 the Visigoths were allowed by Theodosius to live as Federates in Lower Moesia. In my opinion, it was while they were living in Moesia, between 382 and 395, that the people as a whole was converted to Arianism (x). It is important to bear in mind that in the second half of the century their old (1) Journal of Ecclesiastical History , VII (1956), p. 1 ff.</page><page sequence="2">506 E. -A. THOMPSON tribal form of society was breaking down, and a new class of « op- timates» or «megistanes» was trying not without success to mono- polize political power. In 372 a Visigothic chieftain said expli- citly that a poor man's opinion carried no weight in Gothia (г). I In 369 the Christians in Gothia were divided into at legist three sects. First, there were a number of Audians whose piety, austerity and virtue reached such heights as to win praise even from a Catholic writer. Audius founded monasteries and convents in Gothia, and these were not recruited solely from Roman pri- soners : some Visigoths entered them, too (2). It is unlikely that the sect survived for long in Gothia after the persecution of 369- 72. The majority of its adherents fled to the eastern provinces of the Eastern Empire, and the sparse remnants were probably absorbed into Catholicism (3). Secondly, there were the Arians, a number of whom, though not all, fled into the Roman pro- vinces with Ulfila in 347-8. Only one of them apart from Ulfila is known by name - the martyr Frederic who is mentioned in the Gothic Calendar - but even an orthodox writer concedes that Arians, too, were among the martyrs of 369-72 (4). Finally, there were the Catholics, of whom St. Sabas was the most eminent, though it would seem that in the middle of the fourth century they had also a bishop named Goddas (5). It is commonly be- lieved that the 26 persons who were burned in a church during the persecution were Catholics ; and Nicetas was a Catholic, of whom we otherwise know little (e).

They can scarcely have been absorbed by the Arians, for they were closer in doctrine to the Catholics than to the Arians, as Epiphanius repeatedly emphasizes, 230, 2 f. ; 233, 21 f. ; 26 ; 29, and he regards them, perhaps generously, as schismatics rather than heretics, 230, 4.

Unfortunately there is no means of knowing which of these sects had won the greatest number of adherents before 376 ; but what seems to be certain is that in that year there were not many Christians of any description in Gothia (2). Such Christians as existed there were scattered up and down the country, a handful in this village and a handful in that ; and they appear to have belonged to the poorest strata in Visigothic society. There is no reason to suppose that any of the optimates had as yet been tou- ched by the new religion, and in 369 it was «the megistanes through- out Gothia» who ordered the Christians in the country to be persecuted (3). Before 376 Christianity in Gothia was essentially an affair of the poor. Yet in spite of their dangers and difficulties the Gothic Christians tried to convert their fellow-Goths (4), and they even sent out missionaries to their kinsmen, the Ostrogoths in the Ukraine and the Gepids in the mountains north of Transyl- vania, preaching the Gospel and trying to win them to the faith (5) . But both at home and abroad their efforts met with little success, and the barbarians of south-eastern Europe were still overwhelm- ingly pagan when the Visigoths crossed the Danube in 376. The followers of Ulfila and Sabas paid a heavy price for wor- shipping the foreign God in the tents which served them as chur- ches (e). Their numbers doubtless grew in the seven years following 341, when Ulfila returned to Gothia after being consecrated bish- op by Eusebius of Nicomedia. But in 347-8 came the first perse- cution in Gothia, and « many» men and women were martyred (7). sckrijt /. deutsches Altertum , LIX (1922), pp. 265-7.

Thompson Ulfila at the head of an « immense people » fled from Gothia (1), was welcomed into the Roman Empire by Constantius II, and was provided with land around the Moesian city of Nicopolis ; and there is no evidence that he ever returned to Gothia. Now, the number of those who crossed the Danube with him was un- doubtedly small, and phrases about the « immense people » who accompanied him into exile are devout and patriotic exaggera- tions. The persecution apparently affected Catholics as well as Arians (2), but it made little impression on contemporary Romans. Although Constantius used to call Ulfila « the Moses of our time», only one contemporary Roman writer m akes an incidental refer- ence to the persecution, and none at all speaks of the exodus from Gothia (3). There is no reason to believe that every Christian in Gothia fled with Ulfila in 348, and the number of those who remained behind may well have increased by the time of Valens' compaigns in Gothia in 367-9. The second persecution was ordered by the megistanes on the morrow of the defeat by Valens in 369, and was enforced by the confederate chief Athanaric (4) and by the tribal chieftains. It was carried out in three waves, and Sabas was martyred on 12 April 372 after he had survived the two earlier outbreaks (5). In the intervals between the three outbursts there was comparative peace, and Christians who had gone into hiding or had taken refuge in the Roman provinces were able to return (1) Ibid., 29 : cum grandi populo confessorum , Philostorgius, II, 5 : noXvv Áaóv, Jor- danes, Get., LI, 267 : populus immensus, cf.

Loewe, art. cit., 267-9, discusses the chronology but would seem to press the evidence too far. I follow the customary usage in referring to the « 26 martyrs» ; but 27 are known, for we must include Constans (p. 510, n. 4 below). In fact however, there were more even than 27, for hte list of names is said explicitly to be a selection.</page><page sequence="5">EARLY VISIGOTHIC CHRISTIANITY 509 unmolested to their homes if they so wished (1). The fate of those persecuted on this occasion created a deep impression on Roman Christians (2). But many escaped into the Empire (3), the Arians presumably joining Ulfila's settlement at Nicopolis, the Catholics founding a new community ol their own somewhere south of the Danube (p. 513 below), and many of the Audians fleeing to distant Chalcis near Antioch and to places routh of the Euphrates ; while some Christians continued in their faith in Gothia itself even after the persecution, for by no means all the Christians in Gothia had revealed their Christianity to the persecutors (4). Why did the council of the megistanes order the persecution in the first place ? Of the causes of the outbreak of 347-8 nothing whatever is known, but our authorities mention two motives in connexion with that of 369-72. According to the ecclesiastical historian Socrates, the persecution was enforced « because the ancestral religion was being debased». This reason, which the historian says motivated Athanaric, is plausible as far as it goes (5) . Athanaric appears to have been a staunch leader, « the very type », it has been said, « of stern, morose, adherence to old Gothic ways » (6) . He was willing to continue the struggle against the Huns in 376 when the bulk of his countrymen preferred to flee to the Romans for protection. He had sworn a tremendous cath never to set foot on the soil of the traditionel foe, Rome. When he had forbidden the Romans to call him « king » instead of « Jud- ge», his proper title, he had refused to allow even the suspicion to arise that he was aiming at a personal despotism over his people (7). Such a man is unlikely to have welcomed the sight of some of his people abandoning the old tribal beliefs and attaching (1) Passio S . Sabae, 218, 2 ; 24 f.

THOMPSON themselves to a new religion, and a Roman one at that. Atha- naric, we may be sure, carried out the orders of the megistanes with gusto ; and some of the Visigoths who were discovered to have embraced Christianity were put to death by the old ritual method of drowning. The four Christians known to have been drowned in the persecution of 369-72 are all thought to bear Gothic names - Sabas, Innas, Remas, and Pinnas (1). They were not of Roman descent but were all born Visigoths ; and their offense - the abandoning of the religion of their clans - was more heinous than the offence of those Roman prisoners who had been converted to Christianity. Even Socrates, who wrote more than half a century after the persecution, connects the outbreak with the political events which preceded it, fictitious though his account of those events may be (2) ; and the only contemporary authority to refer to the mo- tives of the persecutors, Epiphanius, who wrote only four years after the persecution, says simply that « in order to spite the Ro- mans, because the emperors of the Romans were Christians, he drove out the whole race of Christians from those regions» (3). The Visigothic Christians associated with persons bearing such names as Constans, Nicetas, Anna, Dulcilla, and so on (4). They so venerated a Roman Emperor, Constantius II, who had wel- comed Ulfila in the days of his trouble, as to allot him a day in their Calendar of Church feasts (and they are the only Christian community which is known to have honoured Constantius thus (5) . They were in close relations with the Roman provinces of Asia Minor. In a moment of danger they would flee to the hated Romans as to brothers, and Valens had good political reasons (1) On them see Delehaye, art. cit., pp. 279, 287.

At least one of them, Sabas, was unwilling to take part in a sacred and traditional clan feast when called upon to do so, and he tried to induce others to refrain likewise. The confederate council in 369, still smarting under the defeat inflicted by Valens, must have wondered whether tribal loyalties still meant anything to such men and women as these. It must not be supposed, however, that every Christian in Gothia looked upon the Romans with a kindly eye : we shall see that when the Visigoths crossed into the Empire in 376 their warriors included some Christians who by no means favoured the Romans (p. 513 below). Yet it cannot be doubted that a substan- tial number of the Christians regarded the Romans as « brothers » and to that extent justified the fears of the optimates in 369. The evidence of our two sources, then, at least provides us with the pretexts for the persecution. The megistanes ordered the persecution of the Christians both as an anti-Roman measure, to halt the spread of Roman influence in Gothia, and simultaneously so as to check the decay of the old tribal religion. But there is a further point. We mentioned earlier the fact that the Visigothic tribal system was itself in a state of decay at this date. The old egalitarianism had broken down, the rich man was seizing power, and the poor man was now a political cipher in Gothia. I would suggest as an hypothesis that the decay of the tribal religion and the spread of Roman influence were both alike merely symptoms of the collapse of tribalism. If tribal life had still been in a healthy condition, its religion would not have been disintegrating and spiritual influences from the Roman Empire would not have been making much headway in Gothia. Tribal religion was an integral part of the tribal system itself : neither could exist in its old form without the other. But now the accumulation of privately owned wealth and the concentration of political power were putting an end to the significance of the tribes and hence to the religion of the tribes. That, we may think, is why paganism declined and Chris- tianity triumphed in the last quarter of the century rather than (1) Orosius, VII, 32, 9 ; cf. Passio S. Sabae, 218, 24 ; R. Loewe, Zeitschrift /. deutsches Altertum , LIX (1922), p. 277 f. Their close ties with Asia Minor are by no means wholly disproved by M. H. Jellinek, Festschrift Fr.

If this suggestion is correct, it follows that the megistanes, when they persecuted the Christians, were punishing others for bringing about a situation which they themselves had involuntarily created. At all events, the persecution was not due to any outburst of popular anger. Indeed, the attempts of the council of the vil- lagers in Sabas' village to save the saint from his fate suggests that clan feeling was still stronger in 372 than differences of religion among the clansmen. When no persecution was afoot, Christian and pagan seem to have lived on friendly terms within the one village ; and in times of persecution, if we may judge by the beha- viour of Sabas' fellow-villagers, it may be that several Christians were protected from the persecutors by their pagan neighbours. In fact, the persecution was planned and enforced by the megis- tanes, while the people as a whole resisted it, or did without en- thusiasm what they were ordered to do, or even tried to shelter their members from its blasts (1). This suggests that the megis- tanes may have had another reason for ordering the persecution than those which are reported by our authorities. Since the Christians were drawn in the main from the humblest parts of Visigothic society, the persecution launched by the megistanes was in fact an attack directed at a weak, small, and to some extent isolated section of the poorer folk of Gothia. It would seem that if Sabas had owned some substantial property, the persecutor might have been less ruthless in his treatment of him. But Sabas owned nothing more than the clothes on his back, and so in the opinion ot the persecutor there was no reason why he should not be remorcelessly killed (2). I would suggest that the immediate reason for the persecution was a political one. In 367-9 the Visi- gothic optimates had led the people to starvation and defeat in the war with Valens ; and it is scarcely credible that their inad- quacy or ill-fortune as leaders had failed to call forth criticism from those whom they had led to hunger and ruin. The perse- cution, we may believe, was their answer to the criticisms, for it can hardly be a coincidence that it was on the very morrow of their defeat that they began to burn and drown numbers of the (1) For these points see Historia , IV (1955), pp. 311-8. (2) Ibid., p. 335.</page><page sequence="9">EARLY VISIGOTHIC CHRISTIANITY 513 poorer men and women of Gothia. They tried, on this hypothe- sis, to divert the hostility of the common warriors from them- selves to the small and helpless community of Christians. Sabas and his companions may have been used as a scapegoat for the defeat of 369. II When the Visigoths entered the Roman Empire they soon encountered two groups of Christian Visigoths who had already settled in the provinces before 376. One of these groups consisted of the followers of Ulfila who had been driven from Gothia in 348 and were now living near the city of Nicopolis in Moesia (p. 508 above). They evidently refused to join the main body of their compatriots, even though these had occupied the region between Nicopolis and Beroea soon after they had entered the Empire (x). They did not move even when Nicopolis opened its gates to the invaders in the early years of Theodosius I (2), and they were still living their meagre, semi-pastoral life in that same neighbourhood 200 years later, forgotten until Jordanes noticed them (3). The second of these groups of Christians who were settled in the Em- pire is known only from a brief entry in a seventh-century chro- nicle. In 378, we are told, the « Gothic Confessors», who seem to be the Christians in Fritigern's army, came upon the « former Goths», who had been driven from their country some time be- fore on account of their faith, for they were Catholics (and so cannot be identified with Ulfila's followers). The Gothic Con- fessors asked these Catholics to join them in collecting booty from the Romans : presumably the « former Goths » would be familiar with the countryside and so would be able to help their starving countrymen to find food. But, like Ulfila's followers, they refused. Hence the Confessors killed some of them, and the rest fled to the (1) AMM. Marc., XXXI, 11, 2. (2) Eunapius, frag. 50. (3) Jordanes, Get., LI, 267.

THOMPSON neighbouring mountains and persisted in their Catholicism and in their friendship with the Roman government , which had given them hospitality when they had been expelled from their homeland in the days of Athanaric's persecution ( 1 ). The italicized words should be noted. It was the first occasion on which Christianity appears openly as the pro-Roman force which Athanaric had feared that it might one day become. But Christianity was di- vided against itself. It was a pro-Roman force only among those groups of Visigoths who had received land from the Imperial government. Those who had not yet received land were as hostile to the Romans as were their pagan countrymen with whom they had crossed the Danube. Whatever bonds may have tended to unite the Visigothic Christians, there were forces which were yet stronger and which could bring them into bitter conflict with one another. The subtle diplomacy of Theodosius I, which had so striking an effect on the political life of the Visigoths (p. 505 above), did not leave their religious development unchanged. He induced several of their leaders besides Fravittas to abandon Gothic society alto- gether and to live among the Romans ; and a number of the chiefs who were won over by him began to subscribe - whether or not with sincerity - to the religious beliefs of the Romans at the same time as they put on the uniform of the Roman army. Thus, Modares was now converted to Catholicism, and as early as the first months of 382 he had become a correspondant of Gregory of Nazianzus : he had only recently deserted the Visigoths and he showed such fervent loyalty to the Romans that, after he re- ceived a command in the Roman army, he proceeded to inflict a sharp defeat on a raiding-party of his fellow- Visigoths (2). Gainas became an Arian, and there is little reason to doubt that he did so at about the same time as he sided with Theodosius. But to attach oneself to the religion of the Romans did not neces- sarily involve becoming a Christian : many Romans were still pagan. Hence, Fravittas together with some of his adherents subscribed outspokenly to a form of paganism which won the (1) Isidore, Hist.

It is unlikely that Eunapius would have penned his eulogy of Fravittas' paganism if that paganism had been simply the primi- tive tribal religion of Athanaric ; and Eunapius' language seems to imply that Fravittas and others had begun to worship, however perfunctorily and with however little understanding, at the old altars of Hellas (x). As a parallel to this conversion of a German to Eastern pagan beliefs we may refer to an Alamannic optimate named Mederic who had lived in Gaul as a hostage in the mid- fourth century and had been initiated there into the mysteries of Serapls. On his return to his people beyond the Rhine he changed the name of his son Agenaric to Serapio, and he retained his Eastern religion (or his smattering of it) even when no longer living in the Empire (2). Again, a German of unknown origin named Sigismund, who died at Rome apparently in the fifth century, was a convert to Judaism, married a Jewish wife called Sarah, and is known to us from the inscription on his tomb- stone (3). But there is neither evidence nor likelihood that Fra- vittas' rival Eriulf, the leader of the anti-Roman faction, became a Christian. He was a pagan, but he subscribed to the old Gothic paganism, and that is one reason - his anti-Roman policies being the other - why Eunapius uses very different language of Eriulf from that which he uses of Fravittas. It would seem, then, that several, if not most, of those optimates who were won over politically by Theodosius began to accept some form of Roman religion at the same time as they entered Roman military service. Eunapius seems to suggest that some of these Gothic leaders were insincere in their new religious profes- sions : their change of heart was designed simply to secure them political power (4). As for the bulk of the Visigoths who stayed in Moesia until 395 and did not go off to join Theodosius, there is reason to think that these became a Christian people in 382- 95 (5). There is explicit evidence that within this period the (1) Eunapius, frag. 60 (252, 22 ff. ; 253, 3 ff.), frag. 80 (264, 22), Zosimus, V, 20, 1 ; 21, 5 ; Philostorgius, XI, 8 (139, 12, ed.

THOMPSON Christians included some of the highest members of society, for it was now that the Christian « queen » Gaatha and her son Ari- merius and her daughter Dulcilla made their fleeting appearance in history (1). But the movement towards Christianity did not fail to call forth resistance from some of the tribesmen, though doubt- less from a steadily decreasing number as the years went by and the old conditions crumbled away. Even in the late eighties or the early nineties the friendship of Gaatha was unable to save Wella, a layman, from being stoned to death for accepting the new religion (2). But the attack on Wella is the last outbreak of militant paganism inside Visigothic society of which information has reached us, though a small minority of pagans will have lin- gered on for many decades (3). And it must not be supposed that every Visigoth « converted » at the end of the fourth century imbibed at once the true faith and wholly abandoned his old pagan beliefs and practices ; for many of them Christ will have been simply one more god to worship and placate (4). Between 376 and 382, then, the number of Visigothic Chris- tians increased ; but the conversion of the people as a whole coincided substantially with the period of settlement in Moesia (1) Delehaye, art. cit., p. 279, where there is a difficulty in the words tottov Ы t ónov äjueißovaa tjWev ëœç rfjç yfjç rœv fP(Ojuaí(OV. This implies that the country from which Gaatha set out was not «Roman territory». It cannot be argued that Gaatha was an Ostrogoth and that the reference is to some place in southern Russia : that would not be consistent with Sozomen, VI, 37, 13 f., who unquestionably refers to the same incident and the same community, Delehaye, art. cit., p. 280 f. I take it that Gaatha lived in Moesia, and that our very abbreviated authority has used a phrase of which one implication - that Moesia was not now Roman but Visigothic - is inaccurate. (2) Delehaye, art. cit., p. 279. The view of Loewe, art. cit. 266, that Wellas was lynched by infuriated Arians because he had apostatized to the semi-Arians is scarcely likely to be accepted.

Observe that in XII Toledo 11 (Mansi, XI, 1037 f.) of A.D. 681, when paganism was still being discussed, it seems to be assumed that the pagans- were to be found among the slave population.

The bishops were still fulminating against pa- gans in the closing years of the kingdom : XVI Toledo 2 (Mansi, XII, 70) of A.D. 693, though pagan practices were by no means unknown inside the Church itself : XVII Toledo 5 (Mansi, XII, 99) of A.D. 694.</page><page sequence="13">EARLY VISIGOTHIC CHRISTIANITY 517 (382-395), when they were living in close association with the Roman inhabitants of that region. Since the optimates were now becoming landowners, their social interests were approximating more and more closely to the interests of the Roman landowners around them. The tribal religion had decayed with the decay of the tribes themselves ; and hence, living as they were in a Roman environment, the Visigothic leaders were accepting the outlook of the Roman propertied classes whose social position they hoped to reproduce in their own society. And this was true even when their political submission to the Roman rulers was far from com- plete. In a word, that the Visigoths should have been converted to Christianity in these circumstances and at this date is not wholly incomprehensible. But why did they accept Arianism rather than Catholicism ? Or, to put the question more precisely, when Catholicism, Au- dianism, and Arianism had all three gained a footing among them, why was it that Arianism triumphed and the other two practically disappeared ? To believe with some ancient writers that they embraced Arianism because Valens was an Arian is difficult, for apart from other considerations they were, according to our view, still mostly pagans when Valens died in 378. Nor can we well argue that it was Ulfila's reputation and prestige which won them over, for Ulfila's influence, so far as we know, was confined to the Christian communities : there is no evidence to suggest that he could have swayed « the megistanes throughout Gothia» on any major issue. Again, it was held in the Roman world that the Visigoths did not understand the difference between Arianism and Catholicism and so had adopted the former owing to the « simplicity» of their hearts (1). This may well have been true in so far as the masses of the Visigoths were concerned : we cannot suppose that the average warrior had made a study of recent Greek Christology. But that is scarcely the point. It cannot be argued that the difference between Arianism and orthodoxy was obscure to Ulfila or to his successor Selenas or to Fretela and Sunnia, who discussed with St. Jerome the meaning of 178 pas- (1) Socrates, IV, 33, 9; cf. Procopius, BG , VIII, 4, 11 ; Jordanes, Get., XXV, 132 : rudibus et ignaris.</page><page sequence="14">518 E.-A. THOMPSON sages of the Psalms (1), or to the revisers of Ulfila's translation of the Bible, who are sometimes thought to have altered the Gothic in one or two places in order to lend support to the tenets of Arius (2) . In fact, there was late in the fourth century and early in the fifth a number of educated Visigoths who doubtless played a decisive part in the conversion of their countrymen to Arianism and who knew very well what they were doing. But why were they able to convince the optimates to accept Arianism ? I must admit that in the total absence of Visigothic documents I cannot answer this question. At first sight one or two lines of enquiry may seem likely to be fruitful. Thus, the Arian Trinité hiérarchisée (as Zeiller calls it) (3), a Godhead wherein, as the end of Ulfila's creed shows, the Holy Spirit was subject and obedient in all things to the Son, and the Son subject and obedient in all things to the Father, would accurately reflect the position which the confederate chieftain, rapidly strengthening his position in society, hoped soon to win for himself over against his followers. Such a picture would also be readily comprehensible and accept- able to the tribesmen, for « an anthropomorphic conception of the deity would recommend itself... as more nearly related to their own conception, wherein the full deity was only a step beyond the demi-god, and removed from the hero more by antiquity than by omnipotence, infinity, or incomprehensibility » (4) . Again, it has been pointed out that the strict hierarchy existing within the Arian Trinity and the unqualified obedience of the lower (1) Jerome, Ep. CVI. (2) At I Corinthians, XV, 25 ff. ; cf. G. W. S. Friedrichsen, The Gothic Version of the Epistles (Oxford, 1939), pp. 233, 236 ff., and at Philippians, II, 6, on which see (in English) Edinburgh Review , CXLVI (Oct. 1877), p. 376. But the Arian bias of the pas- sage is denied by F. Jostes, Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache u. Literatur , XXII (1897), p. 186, n. 1 ; F. Kauffmann, Zeitschrift f. deutsche Philologie , XXX (1898), p. 96, n. 1. See nn. ad loc. by E. Bernardt, Vulfila (Halle, 1875), p. 511 ; cf. XXX; and W. Streitberg, Die gotische Bibel , I, p. 370.

But these are speculations, and, since there is no evidence whatever on which to base a discussion, it is hardly profitable to follow them up. Another consideration, however, will almost certainly have had an effect on the Visigothic opti- mates. By accepting Catholicism they could scarcely have failed before very long to have been absorbed into the organization of the universal Church, which in Theodosius' reign they would not all have cared to do, nor, if they had, would their followers have been likely to acquiesce in their action. As Catholics they would unquestionably have lost something of their freedom of organization. Their priests would have been liable to take their instructions from an authority outside the people, who at this date would scarcely have submitted to any organ of government which was directed by Romans. Now, Arianism was not a centralized or interprovincial organization : it remained a number of essen- tially separate, local, and independent churches and hence was more suited organizationally to a people who wished to preserve their social identity inside the Roman Empire. {To be continued).
