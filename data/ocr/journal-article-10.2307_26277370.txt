<plain_text><page sequence="1">Valéry, Paul, Aesthetics. Translated by Ralph Manheim with an introduction by Herbert Read. Bollingen Series xlv 13. New York: Pantheon Books, 1964, pp. 307. S4.00. This thirteenth volume in the Bollingen Series of Valéry translations provides us with an important sampling of the Variétés, including one outstanding essay, "Man and the Sea Shell." The volume is appropriately titled Aesthetics since it includes four essays in which Valéry deals with aesthetics historically and as substantive disciplines. The volume also includes "On the Teaching of Poetics at the Collège de France" and other lectures and extracts dealing with poetics. The translation, by Ralph Manheim, is exact, vibrant, interpretative when necessary, alive with its own discreet life.

Where else in French literature do we find such sustained intelligence focused on the facts of life, intelligence that wishes to understand life in its complexity and ultimate ambiguity? This ondoyant et divers intelligence refuses to reduce the confusing richness of phenomena to clear and distinct ideas. Valéry, the cartesian, is also an anti-cartesian; obscurity, or, as he puts it, ignorance, is a part of his system: "Ignorance is a treasure of infinite price that most men squander, when they should cherish its least fragments...Because, like Montaigne, Valéry is plunged into the flux of perceptions, because he refuses to abandon either the diversity of phenomena or the clarification of mind, his normal mode of thought is less definition or dialectic than it is description. He will begin with a fact —. the dictionary definition of a word such as "aesthetic" or "poetic" ; an obser vation — the shape of a sea shell ; a subjective given such as a sense of rhythm, a specific pleasure or pain. Next, he will attempt to extend the description of this original fact into other analogously related areas by means of scholarship, introspection, common sense, scientific knowledge, etc. As he does so, one or the other of a congeries of typical problems will emerge. In his introduction to this volume, Herbert Read has provided an interesting discussion of Valéry's aesthetics, marred by a tendency to try to make Valéry dialectical. At four or five points in the introduction Mr. Read makes statements of this type : "There, in that emphatic aphorism, we find the essential aesthetic of Valéry — the 'crucial notion'." But there is no single crucial notion, no pole from which the aesthetic emanates or is exuded like the sea shell from the mollusk. There is only the ceaseless dance of mind. The activity of mind does not so much state and resolve problems as describe ballet figures that unfold and expire with the disappearance of the dancer. These figures defined by Valéry's dance of mind include the following: the mind-matter opposition. This often takes the form of consideration of the crucial relationship between self and body. Many of Valéry's insights here predate philosophers such as Gabriel Marcel, Merleau-Ponty and Paul Ricceur in their investigations of this mysterious nexus where the law of contradiction does not apply since self and body may be and not be at the same time (I am and am not this body; my body is tangible and unknowable; my mind intangible yet intelligible; etc.). Emergent with these insights into the domain of the self are discussions on the limitations of knowledge. How does a philosopher know? a poet? If knowing is essentially anthropomorphic, is knowledge unreliable? There are discussions of nature and art; of emotion, both in life and in art. Here we realize that Valéry is one of the very few estheticians ever to treat successfully the question of literary or artistic emotion. Other literary questions are rais ed— the relationship in poetry of sense and sound (again a version of the mind matter distinction); the meaning of form; etc. These problems are like dance figures because Valéry scarcely tries to solve them dialectically ; his concern is to make them bear upon one another analogically, poetically; he focuses them in the heat of his own intellectual emotion. The essay is, for Valéry as for Montaigne, a necessary prose form, since here alone can he demonstrate intelligence in the service of a universe that impresses more 244 winter lyco</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews by its richness and diversity than by its order; here alone can he affirm the proper act of human intelligence — not systematization but decorous sympathy.
