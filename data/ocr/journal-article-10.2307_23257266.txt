A STUDY OF THE BOOK OF JOB Introduction The basically enigmatic character of the relationship of God to man insofar as its implication for the problem of suffering is concerned is emphasized in the Book of Job1 when the curtain is drawn upon the scene in the heavenly court. What actually took place on high is never again referred to in the book. Nor does the unique purpose of the suffering visited upon Job ever expose itself to the ken of the sufferers as well as the dis putants. If man were to know God's plans and intentions the problem of Job would have been solved. But man does not and cannot know total reality. What takes place in heaven is alto gether obscure to man. The prelude thus does not in any way stand in conflict with the book as a whole, but rather confirms its main thesis of the unknowability of God's transcendent pur poses. For even what is known by Revelation is not the ultimate truth, and that too is made known only to those to whom God wishes to communicate His will within the confines limited for man by God's decree. 1. Job The days of silence have come to an end. The friends had been unable to speak to Job, for the pain was too great. They had to wait till Job opened his mouth.2 What did Job have to say? Job does not pray to God. So far he has refused only to blaspheme God. He did not sin with his lips.* The good has come from God. The evil has also come from Him. We must 81</page><page sequence="2">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought doers? The callousness of Job's friends to his suffering begins to manifest itself, a well as their unbounded arrogance and self-righteousness. Eliphaz in his omniscience knows that no innocent man has ever perished (presumably, violently or pre maturely) . How does he know? He speaks of knowledge derived from his own experience,15 which he apparently believes Job will verify if he will search his memory.16 He speaks of the re searches which have confirmed his dogmas.17 But above all he attributes to himself prophetic illumination. He has been priv ileged to receive a communication from on high. In a singularly remarkable passage he describes the experience that revealed to him the truth of the Almighty: Now a word was secretly brought unto me, And my ear received a whisper thereof, In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, Fear came upon me and trembling, And all my bones were made to shake. Then a spirit passed before my face, That made the hair of my flesh to stand up. It stood still but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before my eyes; I heard a still voice.18 What was the great truth revealed to Eliphaz in this appari tion? It was that God places no trust in His angels, that all men are sinful in His eyes, that man is a short-lived creature who can never find justification in the eyes of the Almighty.19 Job was constantly in a state of fright because of his inherent sin fulness. Eliphaz is frightened when the Divine apparition pre sents itself before him.20 The implication of Eliphaz's vision is that were Job to recognize his sinfulness (even if not his sins), and admit that he is unjustified in the eyes of God, he could call upon God and get an answer. It is this recognition appar ently that in the eyes of the "existentialist" Eliphaz makes a man innocent (naki, 4:7) and upright (yashar, ibid.) in the eyes of God and saves him from doom. It is the better part of wisdom to recognize this truth and call upon God.21 God, who, in the introduction, is seeking the justification of man in whom 84</page><page sequence="3">A Study of the Book of Job He takes pride, is, in Eliphaz's view, asserting man's inferiority and lack of worth. In line with his theory, Eliphaz directs Job's attention to his proper task at this time: not to rant against the world and fate, but rather to recognize his frail humanity and call upon God. No higher spiritual being will take up his cause.22 Job is angry. He is envious of men living in tranquility of body and spirit as well as of the dead and the unborn infant.23 He is thus acting like the "fools" {evil, 5:3), who have been observed by Eliphaz to wax rich and suddenly fall from their high estate, so that even their children became poverty-stricken, deprived of rights, with none to help. Suffering does not come in vain: For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground.24 Suffering is not inherent in the natural order. Man brings it on himself. Sparks fly upward only because a smith strikes on the anvil. Troubles come on man because he has brought them on himself.25 Eliphaz is indeed presenting a sound theodicy, one that is ideally true,26 but not necessarily universally applicable. Other possible factors are not taken into consideration at this point. Eliphaz is a very great man, a prophet, an inspired poet, a man of profound piety, but he is also self-assured and uncompassion ate. Perhaps unintentionally he is identifying Job with one of those "fools" whose families are visited by dire penalties because of God's wrath. But does he not know Job? Has he not been Job's friend for so many years? Did he not rend his clothes upon seeing Job and learning of his calamities? The friends had come to comfort him. What happened now? Their philosophy is getting the best of them, and in its name they make brutal insinuations on their beloved friend, the true man of righteous ness. Sincere piety and a devotion to God Who must be right at all costs has allied itself with justification of a fellowman's suffering in which unfortunately all men find secret satisfaction; a fellow's calamity presumably reveals the companion's own supposed superiority as well as the fellow's fallibility, especially 85</page><page sequence="4">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought His best friends have failed him. They have proved deceitful and faithless. Showing no consideration for a stricken friend (since Eliphaz apparently had spoken for all of them, and very likely they had nodded approval of his words), they can hardly be taken as exemplars of God-fearing men. They are not honest, but are merely cringing before God, fearful of a visitation of God's terror on them. He has no request to make of his friends who have now made themselves God's accomplices but to point out to him wherein he has erred. He would not ask them to re deem him from trouble were he but to know that he is not the victim of causeless hostility. Their generalities are of no avail to him. Their words are mere wind.3® The futility of his own life leads Job to reflect once again on the common fate of humanity. He agrees with Eliphaz's general estimate of the tragic character of man's lot. His life is brief. He has no hope for anything after he dies.86 Why should God make his life so unbearable during the brief span that has been allotted unto him? Should he not, rather than concerning him self with the trivial faults of mortal man, be more tolerant and forgiving? Are man's deeds really signicant? They certainly cannot affect God Himself that He should be so attentive to them. Even in sleep He allows man no peace. Is it not He Who is terrifying him with nightmares? Is he a danger to the security of the world like the waves of the sea that seek to flood the dry land? Is God finding it necessary to strike down on him as he does when he quells the fury of the onrushing waters? fvm I a sea, or a sea-monster, lhat Inou settest a watch over me? ... What is man that Thou shouldest magnify him, (\nd tnat lhou shouldest set Thy heart upon him, A.nd that Ihou shouldest remember him every morning, And try him every moment? . . . Li I nave sinned, what do I unto Thee, O Thou watcher of men? And wny dost ínou not pardon my transgression, ^nd take away mine iniquity? hor now shall I lie down in the dust; And lhou wilt seek me, but I shall not be.37 lob admits he may have transgressed, he may have sinned, 88</page><page sequence="5">A Study of the Book of Job but being unaware what his sm was he cannot confess. Then why does not God forgive him now? Wherefore wait till he will no longer be here to enjoy God's clemency. Having moved away from his astrological position, Job is ready to accept God as just, were man only to know why he was suffering and in recognizing man's frailty God would temper his rigorous judg ment with compassion. Since man can do no harm to God, then why is God so concerned and why is He so severe? But then we might ask, why expect Him to be gracious to man? Man's good deeds can no more benefit God than his evil deeds harm Him. 4. Bildad Jobs bitter outpourings against God as well as his acerbic rejection of his friends' "consolations" prompt Bildad the Shuhite to take up the burden. Bildad does not claim to be the recipient of Divine revelation, as did Eliphaz. Nor like him does Bildad claim to know the truth as a result of his personal experiences and observations. He calls attention to the tradition of genera tions. We ourselves are but as yesterday. The experience of the human race leads to the conviction that God is just. The pros perity of the evil-doers does not endure. Experience merely con firms the intuitive truth implanted in the human soul that God is righteous. The mind revolts against the contradictory of this proposition: Doth God pervert judgment? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?88 On the basis of this a priori conception buttressed by experi ence one must necessarily conclude that Job's children perished because of their transgression. Job's suffering, Bildad implies, may not necessarily be the product of his sinfulness. He does not offer any explanation as to what might have brought it on. Per haps he accepts Eliphaz's theory of chastisement,39 or man's general unworthiness in the presence of God.40 Perhaps he takes Job's suffering as a test to which he is put by God: would Job</page><page sequence="6">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought ferently from a human judge who certainly does not keep from the defendant the reason why he is standing trial? Do not condemn me; Make me know wherefore Thou contendest with me.47 Is not man God's handiwork? Does the artist despise his crea tion? Does he not treat it lovingly and gently? Why does God then mishandle the work of His hands?48 Job is aware of another possible answer, namely, that there is no God to complain to or complain about. But this answer is completely unacceptable to Job, as it would be to any devout person, to whom the denial of God could be only the thought of the "wicked man" (rasha), who seeks thereby to reject respon sibility. And yet is not the Almighty Himself fostering the very thoughts of the deniers? Is it good unto Thee that Thou shouldest oppress, That Thou shouldest despise the work of Thy hands, So that dost shed light upon the counsel of the wicked?49 Is God like man? Man delights to find fault with his neighbors. He spies them out and enjoys exposing their weaknesses. Men engage in this kind of behavior because of their limited con cerns, their pettiness and meanness, since they seek to aggran dize themselves by belittling their fellows. Life is brief, and within this brief span every man tries to achieve something for himself and is not always discriminating in his methods. Hast Thou eyes of flesh, Or seest Thou as man seeth? Are Thy days as the days of man, Or Thy years as a man's days, That Thou inquirest after my iniquity, And searchest after my sin?50 Job's God is not anthropomorphic. No human frailties may be attributed to Him. How is it that He is unaware of the true nature of Job's character? Job would not allow one misstep to lead him into a permanent departure from God and His law, 92</page><page sequence="7">A Study of the Book of Job even it true that he had sinned. God is free of human weakness. But he cannot be less kind and concerned than man. Is there not evidence for this proposi tion in the very creation of man? Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me logether round about; yet Thou wouldst destroy me! Remember, I beseech Thee, that Thou hast fashioned me as clay And wilt Thou bring me unto dust again? Hast Thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese/ Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews. I hou hast granted me lire and love, And Thy Providence hath preserved my spirit.51 The Divine ambivalence is incomprehensible to Job. The God Whose love creates is the God Whose anger destroys. Moreover, God's pedantic over-scrupulousness is unintelligible. If the Al mighty is troubled by man's sins or his sinfulness, why does He not cleanse man from sin? After all, man's guilt redounds to his own harm rather than to God's? But even righteousness does not save. Why then was he sent upon the earth to lead a miser able life in a world in which man's existence is so "brief, nasty and brutish," from which the exit is only into a land of bleak ness, everlasting darkness and disorder? 5. ZOPHAR Zophar the Naamathite assumes the task of answering Job at this point. Like his companions, Zophar remonstrates against Job's self-righteousness and pride, from which, to be sure, all of Job's friends suffer in no mean degree. Job wants God to speak to him and tell him what sins he has committed. Did it occur to Job that were God to reveal His truth to him, he would be overwhelmed by the mysteries of Divine wisdom which are not patent to the human mind? He would then realize that God was not dealing unjustly with him but very mercifully. By im plication, God does not answer Job because he wishes to spare him the pain of self-discovery. This argument seems rather keen, 93</page><page sequence="8">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought But can his mends truly trust in God s favor? They are taking up for God not because He is just, but because He is powerful. They are all liars and flatterers. Are they not afraid that God Who knows their innermost thoughts will overwhelm them with His terror? Jobs service to truth is service to God. Then all the more reason why he wants God to call upon him, so that he might answer Him, or that he should call and God would answer him. Instead God treats him like an enemy. Is it for youthful sins that he committed? Perhaps, but could God continue to hound him for sins long atoned for? Is the punishment commensurate with the sin? Light seems to be breaking through in Job's thinking, but he cannot free himself from his troubled preoccupations. What is man? he ponders, extending the full scope of his ruminations, as he generally does, not on his own suffering, but on the lot of mankind as a whole: Man that is born of woman Is or few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower and withereth; He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.58 At this juncture, Job seems to have totally adopted Eliphaz's view of man. Like Eliphaz, he affirms that man is impure. But his corollary is different. Since man's life is brief, God ought not to be too concerned with this puny creature. He should let him live in peace for the brief span allotted to him, for he has nothing to look forward to after he dies. Man is like a flower which fades and withers, not like a tree which can go through a second birth: For there is hope of a tree If it be cut down that it will sprout avain, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease . . . Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth and lieth low; Yea man pensheth and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, 96</page><page sequence="9">A Study of the Book of Job And the river is drained dry; So man heth down and nseth not; Till the heavens be no more, they shall not wake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.6® A sudden flash races through Job s muid. Is it true that man shall not live again? The wish that God might hide him away from His own wrath till the appointed time for reconciliation arrive grows into a prayer and hope: If a man die, may he live again? All the days of my service would I wait, Till my relief should come— Thou woulaest call, ana I would answer Thee; Thou wouldest long for the work of Thy hands.60 But this glimmer of hope is dimissed by Job: The waters erode the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth; So Thou destroyest the hope of man.61 Job intimates that God could sustain the hope of man for a renewal of his life after he dies. But Job refuses to recognize this eventuality as valid. He is still too embroiled in his own bitterness to be able to accept the solution of survival. At this point, the rise of a new hope and its rejection, the first cycle of the dialogue comes to a close.62 NOTES 1.
