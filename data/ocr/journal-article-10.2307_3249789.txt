<plain_text><page sequence="1">HELEN B. CHAPIN A LONG ROLL OF BUDDHIST IMAGES IV Revised by Alexander C. Soper 87 The sixtieth group: The inscription at the upper left edge of this panel reads: P'u-men p'in Kuan-shih-yin teng, i. e. Avalokitesvara of the Samantamukha Section.,is This evidently applies to the Avalokitesvara [of thefollowing threeframes], leaving this section without a label. Again Chapin mis-read as teng an abbreviationfor P'u-sa, or Bodhisattva. Having assigned the title to the next group ofpictures, she continued to consider the deity of frame 87 an Avalokitesvara in spite of the absence of identifying attributes; presumably on the grounds that itfalls within an otherwise recognizable group of Avalokitelvara manifestations. Avalokiteivara, whose body is gold in color, is seated cross-legged on a white lotus. He has the urian on his forehead. He wears a red skirt and red scarves, red and gold jewelry--bracelets, earrings, necklace, etc.-and a red and gold crown, in which there is no dhydni Buddha. His double halo is black and white, edged with flame. He holds a lotus-shaped dish in his left hand and a lotus (?) in his right. In front is an incense burner, from which issue flames. To the right is an Apsaras with flying white scarf, holding a dish of lotus flowers. To the left is another, holding an incense burner. Both are seated at ease on lotuses. In the foreground, to the right, is a monk seated on a mat on a rock, his sandals before him. He wears a white robe with a hood. To the left is a standing monk with a white scarf in both hands. x s A reference to the 24th chapter of the Saddharma pundarlka sfitra (in the extant Sanskrit version translated by Kern in the Sacred Books of the East series, vol. XXI; the 2,th in the Chinese translation by Kumarajiva). This tells of the various perils and difficulties from which Avalokitesvara saves those who call on his name. For descriptions of paintings from Tun- huang on this subject, see Waley, Catalogue, pp. 4, 38,45,15 o. His statement on p. 15 I that the category of "eight" perils "in China and Japan appears to be quite unknown" needs modification in view of the painting under discussion. As he points out, however, the perils as actually represented in painting and sculpture are very different from those described in the sitra, even from those in the verse portion. He mentions two representations in which there are eight scenes, though "it is by no means clear that there are more than seven perils." It seems to me that once sculptors-probably swerving to the exigencies of space-had made eight scenes illustrating seven perils, as in the Kanheri cave [relief] (Coomaraswamy, History, pl. XLIII), it would follow as the night the day that the spectators, pious lay men and women no doubt, would soon be talking of the "Eight Perils". In any case the "eight" came to be "a part of the iconographical law, written or unwritten." That one is included in the other (for example the peril from elephants in the [more general] peril from wild beasts, is merely incidental. [ACS]: See Soper, "Four columnsfrom a Chinese temple," Honolulu Academy of Arts, Special Studies, I, z947, PP. 9-Y o, for a Chinese sequence of I8 perils, dating perhaps from early Ming (or Yiian, or late Sung, according to more recent suggestions). For the theme of Kuan-yin's rescues in Indian, Chinese and Japanese art see M. Murase in the current Art. Asiae (i. e. XXXIII, 1/2, 1971). 75</page><page sequence="2">Near him stand two creatures, half bird and half human Garudas, and a gentle-faced angel with wings, shown entirely in the manner of a Western angel. 88-90 The sixty-firstgroup: Avalokiteivara, Savior from the Eight Perils, a picture in three sections. In the center one, Avalokiteivara sits on a lotus, his right foot pendent on a [smaller] lotus; while another, empty, is ready for his other foot should he wish to change position. The lotuses comes from one stalk which rises from the midst of water, surrounded by decorative white clouds. The divinity wears a red and white striped skirt, over which is draped a maroon-colored scarf. He is adorned with a gold necklace, with gold bracelets of considerable width high up on his arms, with a gold girdle, and a kind of jewelled apron. He has a single, large, empty halo, slightly bluish in color, from the top of which issue blue rays in groups of three. Above, is a canopy composed of red and magenta lotuses from which jewelled chains hang. The same mountain landscape extends in back of all three sections, and the same stream flows through them, with shores to the front and back. In front of the central figure of Avalokitegvara is a snake issuing from a conch-shell on the surface of the water, which ripples around it. To the left is seen a sea-monster's head emerging from the waves and vomiting volumes of water. Nearby on the shore, are a wheel and a tripartite jewel, both surrounded by flames. On the other side, somewhat further in the background than the monster is another similar one. To the right is a cloud. Opposite, on the other side, in the third section, is an amoeba-like figure on the surface of the water. On the shore, in the immediate foreground, to the right in the central section, walking side by side, are a monk in magenta robes holding an incense burner, and a woman, hands in aijali mudrd, dressed in red and white. In the right-hand frame, a small inscription to the spectator's right, reads: Ch'u yt*an pao Kuan-shih-yin, i.e., Avalokite'vara, who averts the punishments caused by evil thoughts and actions. Avalokitesvara, much smaller than the central figure, of which it is not a replica, and dressed in flowing robes, is shown walking, lotuses growing from each footstep. He holds a willow branch in his right hand and a flask in his left. On the other side of the mountain are two men, one with his hands in dnjali mudrd on the edge of a precipice and the other behind, with hands raised. This is no doubt the peril of being pushed off mountains, either the Vajra Mountains or Mount Sumeru. Slightly lower on the left appears the inscription: Ch'u shui nan Kuan-shih-yin, i. e. Avaloki- teivara who averts perils on water. A boat is seen in which are three men, one paddling. On the shore nearby Avalokiteivara rides a cloud, seated in maharadjaliladdsana, holding a lotus in his right hand and a flask in his left. Not far away is a heap of coral from which issue rays. Lower on the right appears the inscription: Ch'u hsiang nan Kuan-shih-yin, i. e.: AvalokiteS- vara who saves from the peril of elephants. Avalokiteivara is standing with a willow branch in his right hand and a flask in his left. To the right is a man in a pink robe; and in front of the divinity is a black elephant with trunk raised, half kneeling. In center foreground is another small Avalokiteivara walking, lotuses springing up wherever he steps. He holds a bowl in his left hand and a willow branch in his right, and is shown in three- quarters view. Before him kneels a man in a light yellow robe with a red belt, and [in the left corner] is a serpent. The inscription, to the left, reads: Ch'u she nan Kuan-shih-yin, i.e.: Avalokiteivara who saves from the peril of snakes. 76</page><page sequence="3">In the left-hand section Avalokite'vara is seen at top right, sitting on a cloud, at the foot of tall mountains. He holds a willow branch in his right hand and a fruit (?) in his left. In front, a devotee, dressed in magenta, is bowing before him, his hands in anjali mudrd. He is evidently rendering thanks for his rescue from a wild animal, spotted black and white, which is shown behind him. The inscription reads: Ch'u shou nan Kuan-shih-yin, i. e: Avalokitesvara who saves from the peril of wild beasts. In the upper left hand corner of the section and of the group, stands Avalokitesvara, [in profile], holding a willow branch in his right hand and a flask in his left. In front of him are trav- ellers with full bags and a laden horse coming safely through a mountain pass. Behind them at the top of the pass, are several robbers, armed with spears and bows and arrows, from whose attack Avalokite'vara has saved the travellers. The inscription at the upper left is cut off. In the water in the middle foreground are seen a flaming jewel and two horses, one of which is winged. Below to the left, on the near shore, just at the edge of the water, stands Avalokiteg- vara, with a rosary held in both hands. He is seen in three-quarters view, his back to the water, facing toward ayamen (official building). In the lower left hand corner, partly cut off, is theyamen, in the door of which is seated an official, before whom an attendant brings an accused person. This scene represents the danger of the police and the courts, as doubtless the inscription, which is cut off, [by remounting], explained. Slightly to the right is Avalokitesvara walking, lotuses springing from his footprints. He carries a willow branch in his right hand and a lamp (?) in his left. Before him, a man in an orange robe is running toward him from pursuing flames. The inscription to the right reads: Ch'u huo nan Kuan-shih-yin, i. e. Avalokitesvara who saves from the peril of fire. The eight subsidiary figures of Avalokiteivara, each of which is associated with one of the Eight Perils, are all much smaller than the central and main figure of the same divinity; and all are dressed in flowing [Chinese-style] robes in contrast to the abbreviated costume in Indian style of the chief image. Each of the small figures has a round halo edged with flames back of his head. The large inscription to the left may possibly refer to the Avalokite'vara just described. It reads: Nan-wu hs in-sheng ch'iu ku Kuan-shih-yin teng, i.e. Adoration to Avalokitesvara who seeks the sound and saves from suffering. Hsfin-sheng is probably another way of rendering what was mistakenly supposed to be the meaning of the name Avalokite'vara: the usual translation of which also occurs in this inscription, to wit Kuan-shih-yin, i. e. looking on the world sounds. The ivara in Avalokiteivara, instead of being understood as I~vara, Lord, which is its true derivation, was thought to be ivara, sound. With reference to this last claim, see Soper, Literary Evidence, pp. I57- .- The label is actually on the right edge of the nextframe, no. I, and shouldprobably refer to it instead of to no. y o. What Chapin transcribed as teng, andfailed to translate because it makes no sense that way, is again a widely used T'ang scribe's abbreviation for P'u-sa, i. e. Bodhisattva. The definition of hs in sheng given in Dai Kanwa jiten, IV, 7447/1o, quotes apassage from the annals of the Wei kingdom in which the simile "as echo follows sound" is used. 77</page><page sequence="4">9I The sixty-secondgroup: Avalokite'vara, large in size, rides over waves on a lotus petal, trailing a blue cloud behind, to the right of which are magenta clouds. The funnel-shaped cloud is coming from above, rather than from behind, and so-as in the formula used endlessly in the Tun-huangpaintings-denotes a descentfrom on high andfar away. He is dressed in a yellow under-robe with a red-figured border at the top, which shows through his over-robe of net. This outer robe has a yellow border with tendril designs in red. A wide scarf of pale magenta hangs over his right arm, and another pale yellow scarf streams out. His right hand holds a rosary and his left hand rests on top of his right wrist. He wears a gold necklace, earrings, and an elaborate gold headdress in which is his dhydni Buddha, Amitdbha. Some parts seem to be missing here. The alternation of border vajras whose claws splay out (A) or curve in (B) is radically disturbed in the series of Kuan-yin icons, following the Perils. Beginning with frame .9 they run: B, B, B, A, B, A, B, B, A, B, A, B, A. The two Kuan-yin frames that precede the Perils, and the Perils themselves, add A, B, A, B, A. One more Kuan-yin, in firame zz3, is A. At least one and perhaps two Kuan-yin Aframes seem to be missing. 92 Thesixty-thirdgroup: Avalokitesvara, with six arms and three heads, each with a third eye, is standing. In his crown is the dhydni Buddha Amitdbha. He carries in his proper left hands the lotus, the bow, and the rosary. His upper right hand is in abhaya mudrd, and in the other two he carries an ascending cloud and an arrow. An antelope skin is thrown over his left shoulder. He wears anklets, bracelets on his upper and fore-arms, a long chain around his neck with pendants hanging over his arms, and a jewelled apron over his hips. He wears also a scarf. His long hair flows over his shoulders. He stands on a lotus which rests on a dark magenta cloud, which in turn issues from the mouth of a tortoise. The tortoise is swimming or floating on the surface of an expanse of water. To the right rises a small white cloud on which is a conch shell; to the left is a similar cloud bearing a dish of lotuses. Avalokiteivara has a small, colorless halo with projections somewhat resembling the "fingers" of the fruit called Fo shou, Buddha's hand. Above is a white lotus canopy, garlanded. To both right and left of Avalokiteivara is a trident standard, around which twines a snake. Two small boys stand, one on each side, each holding a disk; possibly representing the sun and moon. To the left is an inscription which reads: Nan-wu pai shui ching Kuan-yin, i.e. Adoration to Avalokiteivara, the essence of plain water.II6 This probably refers to the figure just described. Between this section and the one following some parts are evidently missing. 93 The sixty-fourth group: The Thousand-armed AvalokiteSvara stands under a pink lotus canopy, from which hang garlands. Beside the usual forty arms with attributes there is a forty-first emerging from the top of Avalokiteivara's head, which holds in the palm a seated figure of Amitabha Buddha. In the II6 The phrase pal shui ching may be a translation (or possibly even a transliteration) of a special form of "Avalokitegvara". 78</page><page sequence="5">headdress of the Bodhisattva is another Amitabha, this time standing: a pose which violates the sidhana rules for dhydni Buddhas.,1 The first "violator" of these rules was the "Sitra on visualizing the Buddha Amitdyus" translated at the south Chinese court at Nanking between 424 and 442. There the elaborate description of Avalokiteivara as senior attendant on the Buddha includes: "On His head is a celestial crownfashioned of wondrous gems, within which is a standing, magically-created Buddha twenty-five yojanas tall..." This is perhaps one of the reasons why the Kangy6 (to use its familiar Japanese name) has come to be considered a Chinese work from the start: no Sanskrit equivalent has been found. See Soper, Literary Evidence,pp. i , 161. Each of the forty-one arms has an eye on the palm. The attributes held and the mudrds formed are as follows: Proper left Outer hands i.

Ewers of this shape are used today by the Lamas of Tibet. 79</page><page sequence="6">Avalokite'vara has three haloes, the two inner ones flame-ringed. The outer one, which is, of course, the largest, does not extend below the knees, but reaches considerably above the head, the neck or shoulders of the divinity being about the centre of the circle forming the halo. All three haloes are plain, without any suggestion of the thousand arms or hands, the eyes in the palms of which often form a kind of decoration of the haloes of this form of Avalokitesvara. The divinity wears a red-pink skirt with a white scarf around the waist, which hangs down over the skirt; and he is adorned with jewelry-anklets, bracelets, jewelled collar, gold chains hanging over his skirt, etc. He stands on a white lotus, with magenta-tipped petals. To the right is a small figure of a man with a black hat holding in his mouth and with both hands a red bag which is open, showing a pile of things inside. Opposite, a small man, naked except for a loincloth, holds out empty hands to Avalokite'vara. Compare the corresponding figures in the Stein Tun-huang painting, No. XXXV in Waley's Catalogue, p. 59, inscriptions (6) right and (6) left. To the right, nearer the foreground, is a fierce divinity, probably Vajrayaksa. He is three-headed and four-armed. His proper left upper hand holds a trident, his corresponding right hand holds a hatchet, and the other two make mudrd separately. Attending him, but facing from him towards the centre, is Vajrdfikusa, a small swine-headed individual, kneeling. The fierce divinity opposite, probably Kundali Vidydrdja, has one head, with what appear to be snakes in his hair, and six arms. In his upper proper left hand, he holds a wheel; with his middle left, he makes a mudrd; and the third left is crossed in front with the third right hand. The upper right makes a mudrd; the middle holds a one-pointed vajra; and the third is crossed in front with the corresponding left hand. He is attended by Vindyaka (Gane'a), a small Deva king with a white elephant's head, who kneels facing Vajrdfikusa, to whom he is pendent. 94 The sixty-fifth group: There is no inscription. [A deity identifiable as] Amoghapida Avalokite'vara is shown seated on a lotus in lalitisana, with the pendent right foot resting on a smaller red lotus. He is within a kind of pavilion with roof and pillars, elaborately decorated; from the roof hang curtains, ribbons, and two cords tied in knots and adorned with jewels. The lotus stalk which bears the flower supporting Avalokiteivara rises from a pond full of [small] pink and white lotuses. The Ndga kings Nanda and Upananda, each with three serpent heads, half emerge from the pool, each resting a hand on the lotus stalk. Each is accompanied by [his consort], a Ndgini with one serpent head above her human one. Amoghapida Avalokite'vara is mild of countenance. He wears an elaborate gold crown, in which there is no dhydni Buddha, and is adorned with jewelry; necklaces, bracelets, anklets, apron, and earrings, which are not alike in the two ears.'20 He has the drend on his forehead. He wears an orange skirt over which is draped a white scarf; his upper garment shows pink at the folds. The oval halo behind his head is plain, but the larger one, encircling the body from the lotus seat upward, is edged with flames. Within this aureole are small Buddha figures representing the Seven Buddhas of the Past and Present.IZ 20o [ The wearing of] two different earrings, one a man's and the other a woman's, [is a] characteristic of the Hindu divinity Siva, especially in his form as Ardhandrisvara, and signifies his dual nature, since "half is Umd." IZ2 These manusa Buddhas are: Vipaiyi, Gikhi, Viivabha, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, KiSyapa, and Sakyasimha (i.e. Sdkyamuni). 80</page><page sequence="7">The attributes held and mudrds formed are: Proper left Proper right i. Lotus on which rests i. Five-pronged vajra the Prajgipdramiti sftra 2. Wheel, similar to symbol 2. Hatchet-like weapon of Cintdmani-cakra122 3. Trident 3. Tripartite jewel 4. Lasso 4. Sword On each side of the lotus pond is a vase with flowers. These additional symbols of abundance emphasize the meaning of the lotus pond from which emerges the big lotus bearing Amoghapida Avalokitesvara. Amoghapada is here conceived of as the giver of all desirable things. He is primarily, of course, one "who throws the rope not in vain," i. e. a fisher of souls; or in the words of Francis Thompson, the Hound of Heaven. In the immediate foreground are the Seven Gems [or Treasures] of the Cakravartin. It would seem that the Minister is missing. In his place is a figure larger than that of the General, of a woman holding a jewel who much resembles Sri Mahddevi. 95 The sixty-sixth group: A form of Avalokitesvara, eight-armed and single-headed, is standing on a pale maroon lotus, surrounded by a large, oval blue halo. At the rim are white lotus petals, facing inward, and outside these is a conventional flower border, the whole edged with red flames. Avalokitesvara wears a dull, purplish-red skirt with white scarves; is adorned with jewelry--gold anklets, bracelets on upper and lower arms (those on the upper of the two normal arms have bright red ribbon hangings), earrings, and a headdress in which there is no dhydni Buddha. Above are white clouds, from which hangs gold and red garlands. The attributes and mudrds are: Proper left i. Forked stick i. Makes a mudrd 2. Red lotus 2. Green palm (?) 3. Flask 3. Makes a mudra 4. Makes a mudrd 4. Makes a mudrd In front, to the right, is a four-handed, tusked demon, red in color. His two main wrists are crossed, each hand in a mudrd; the other proper left hand holds a lasso and the other proper right one, a mace. To the left is a pale grey demon with a bird's beak and red hair. In the immediate foreground are five offerings: at the center, a gold dish containing jewels; next left, a gold dish of flowers and a conch shell; and to the right, a gold dish containing something white, and an open- work incense-burner (?) of gold. I22 The wheel is not flat and has an axis. The hand of Amoghapaa holds this axis by the thumb and middle finger, and the wheel appears foreshortened. 81</page><page sequence="8">An inscription occurs on the extreme right [edge] of the section [just] left of this group, which may or may not refer to the Avalokite'vara just described. It reads: Chiu chu chi-ping Kuan-shih- yin, i. e. Avalokitesvara who saves from the various diseases. 96 The sixty-seventh group: A form of Avalokitesvara, four-armed and single-headed, on whose flesh are traces of green, is seated in lalitisana on a pale maroon lotus, the right foot pendent resting on a small white lotus, while a small red lotus [alongside] is ready for his left foot. The two small lotus stalks branch from the big one that emerges from water; other leaves and flowers are visible. Avalokiteivara wears a red skirt, a white scarf, and a pink girdle, over which is a girdle of gold. An orange and red scarf hangs over both shoulders, while a maroon scarf adorns the left shoulder only. He has an elaborate gold crown, in which is a seated dhydni Buddha, and all the royal jewel- ry-gold earrings, necklace, bracelets on both upper and lower arms (the former with red hang- ings), and anklets. The arms hold: Proper left Proper right i. Hatchet 1. Willow spray 2. Lasso (on raised index finger, hand in 2. Unidentified (hand extended, palm front of body) outward) The inner halo is oval and red in color; the outer is pale blue. Within the outer halo are the Buddhas of the Ten Directions, each in a red robe; the halo has a red and gold border, edged with red and gold flames. Above, in the flames, are three (?) Buddhas, the center one the largest. [In the sky] are two flying Apsarases with red scarves. The inscription on the right reads: She-fu-li Fo-mu, i.e. She-fu-li Buddha's mother. Very likely this refers to some image other than the one just described, which seems to be masculine. I take this as a renderingforJambhali: a name that I have not found in any lists, but which should identify the female counterpart and consort of Jambhala, the god-of-wealth aspect of Kuvera. She is normally called Vasudhadrad; and under that name, P'o-su-t'o-lo, appears inframe zoR below, with different iconographic details. What Chapin took to be a willow spray may be the stalk of grain which may be one of her attributes; and the "unidentified object" may be a small treasure-vase. According to Getty, Gods of Northern Buddhism, p. Ix 5, she may be ac- companied, as she is here, by four minor goddesses. The term "Buddha's mother" of course does not refer to the mother of Sgkyamuni, [Queen] MgyB,I 3 but is used for Dharma, the Law, or for Prajfia, Wisdom; either figuratively or conceived as a feminine divinity, a personification of the Law or of Wisdom. Sometimes this title is added to the name of a feminine Tantric divinity, for example Mahi Mayuri; this is evidently the case here. I have not yet identified this divinity; she is not given in the Mikkyd daijiten. 123 This name is also significant, as Dr.Coomaraswamy has pointed out; see his Elements, p. 23, and n.48, p. 73. 82</page><page sequence="9">It would seem from this inscription that a feminine form of Avalokitesvara, an Avalokites- vari, was included among the different forms of this divinity. We do not find the later Kuan-yin, a completely Sinicized female transformation whose images in all mediums recur so often from Ming times down to the present day. 97 The sixty-eighth group: The inscription to the left reads: P'u-t'o-lo Shan Kuan-yin, i.e. Avalokitesvara of Mount Potalaka. The figure is three-headed, of a pale flesh color; his proper left face grey and his proper right one a deeper flesh tone. Fangs extend over the lower lip on the two side faces, and each face has three eyes. He stands on a maroon lotus. His necklace and bracelets on both upper and lower arms are snakes, some dark crimson, others blue. A yellow cloth is draped over his left shoulder; on it is a crimson snake. He wears a pink, skirt, gold anklets and knee-trimmings, a tiger-skin girdle over which is a [belt] of gold, and a red scarf with a design in crimson. In the background is a rocky landscape. Above the divinity hangs a maroon flower canopy. Just above the small, pale green oval halo are seen standing figures of the Buddhas of the Ten Directions, each in a red robe. The attributes and mudrds are: Proper left i. Lasso 1. Arrow 2. Bow 2. Rosary 3. Maroon lotus 3. Makes the varada mudra Below is a pool with a rocky shore. In the center is a conch shell, with a fish's head to each side; an association that also occurs in the Yamanaka-[Fujii] picture-scroll, in connection with the legend of the Hsi-erh River in Yiinnan. Between the head and the conch on each side are three unidentified objects issuing from the water. See Soper, Foreword and Excursus,fig. 7. The "rocky shore" is treated in a relatively free version of the building-block formula which in Japanese Tantric art isparticularly well known in the rock seat providedfor Fudi Myjj. We have seen this before with a more melodramatic deity in frame lo, where its regularity makes it more like the Japanese usage. Withoutpanelling it recurs in frames y23 and I24. The preceding figure is entirely unlike all the [other] representations of the Avalokiteivara (or, one had better say here) the Kuan-yin of Mount Potalaka known to the writer. Potalaka was [imagined as lying off the coast of] Southern India. =* The Chinese [equivalent], P'u-t'o-Shan, is also in the South, [offshore from] Ningpo. In the temples there the images are of a gracious feminine divinity, often called Nan-hai Kuan-yin, or "Kuan-yin of the Southern Seas". The rocky setting, the standing pose, and the Indian type of dress recur in the Bodhisattva flgure-one-headed and two-armed-shown in a well known British Museum fragmentary painting 124 The Tibetan author of the Sambilai lamyig puts Potalaka in the sea south of Ceylon. See the translation by Griinwedel, "Der Weg nach Sambhlla," Abh. der Kdnig.Bayer.Akad.der Wiss.,Phil-hist.Klasse, XXIX, 3, P. 25 - 83</page><page sequence="10">in the Stein collection from Tun-huang. See Soper "Representations of famous images at Tun- huang," Artibus Asiae, XVII, 4, z , ig. I andp. 3 62. 98 The sixty-ninth group: Avalokitesvara, a normal flesh color, stands on two pale blue lotuses, holding a willow branch in his right hand and a flask in his left. He has a red-gold headdress without any dhydni Buddha. He wears a dull orange skirt, a green-grey overskirt, and a pale maroon girdle, with red-gold bracelets, necklace, and earrings. He has the urva, and a moustache and goatee. His halo is pale blue, edged with flames. All the colors are faded and worn. Above are seen a pagoda and the roofs of two temples rising from a mass of shaded maroon clouds. Avalokite'vara is standing by the shore. Rocks are seen toward the upper left. In the fore- ground to the right is a large glass bowl containing peonies (?) The inscription to the right reads: Nan-wu ku-ch *eh hai-an Kuan-shih-yin, i.e. Adoration to Avalokitesvara, the solitary crosser of the seashore. This figure suggests the monk, incarnation of Avalokite'vara, in the Ytinnanese scroll formerly owned by Yamanaka and Co., and the inscription possibly refers to his trip from India to Y innan. In " Yinnanese images", p.z77, this "trip" became "his sea journey". The idea was a good guess, but a little too off-center, and better dictionaries than Chapin could use have made it most unlikely today. The title means, I think, Adoration to A., the sole and supreme farther shore. The theme of crossing over, as a metaphorfor salvation, was one of the timeless clich's of Buddhism. 99 The seventieth group: Avalokitesvara, very like a piece of sculpture, stands in a large, circular aureole, pale blue, with a narrow gold rim. Under his feet is a lotus, the top of which is yellow, with grey petals, resting on the waves of the sea. Above whirl maroon clouds. On the shore to the right is a female figure in a white robe holding a red book, and to the left is another holding a scarf. In the fore- ground two men are at work making sculpture. I continue with Chapin's later description, from " Yiinnanese images", p. -7. To the right is a dark-skinned man-possibly an Indian sculptor working in Yunnan-with a huge piece of wood and a hatchet. To the left a pale-skinned man in a white robe, looking like the white-robed sculptor in the Nan Chao t'u chiian, holds in his hands a small image, doubtless cast in metal, of our Avalokiteivara. Nearby are scissors, hammer, a bowl, a bag, a basket of charcoal, and a dish from which issue flames, for all the world like the scene in the Nan Chao t'u chiian. Li Lin-ts'an identifes the dark-skinned man as the village head-man beating his drum, a much more likely element in the scene than an irrelevant sculptor. To be sure the long roll version looks a little like wood-cutting, since the original drum has been flattened and the implement used seems clearly to be a hatchet; very possibly the later painter was no longer entirely sure what he was supposed to be doing. To judge from the total iconographic scheme of the long roll, in the z 7o's the A-ts'o-yeh Kuan-yin legend no longer had the overwhelmingprimacy claimed for it earlier. 84</page><page sequence="11">Avalokiteivara wears a red skirt, the folds of which are tinged with gold. His flesh is gold in color, and he is naked above the waist except for jewelry. His headdress, in which there is no small Buddha, is a complicated red and gold affair. The inscription to the left reads: Chen shen Kuan-shih-yin P'u-sa, i. e. Avalokiteivara Bodhis- attva, whose body is Truth. Or perhaps: "A. B. [revealed in his] True Body"; this as a reminder of the A-ts'o-yeh claim to supremacy. Ioo The seventy-firstgroup: Avalokite~vara, whose flesh is gold in color, stands on a grey lotus resting on a dragon ped- estal. Two elaborate aureoles in black-and-white, with the central halo gold, back the divinity. Above is a canopy of three lotuses in black-and-white with hanging garlands of gold and red. Avalokiteivara wears an elaborate red robe with gold folds, and is adorned by jewelry and a long red scarf. In his red and gold headdress is a seated dhydni Buddha, Amitibha. He has four attend- ants: to the proper left a Bodhisattva (?) in white robes holding a fan in his right hand; to the right, another holding aju-i scepter. In the immediate foreground, to the spectator's right, is a Ndgini seated Western fashion on her coils. She has a crest of innumerable [i. e. many] serpent heads. To the left is a warrior. The inscription to the left reads: I-ch'ang Kuan-shih-yin P'u-sa, i, e. I-ch'ang Avalokiteivara Bodhisattva. I have not yet identified this form. In "Yiinnanese images", p. 76, Chapin makes an interesting suggestion: I-ch'ang was the "alternate name" of the Hou Li monarch, r. zz47-72, who was the father of the king under whom the long roll waspainted. It was also he, calling himself Huang Ti P'iao-hsin Tuan Cheng- hsing, who "on behalf of the Princes Tuan I-ch'ang-sheng and Tuan I-ch'ang -hsing," commissioned the inscribed bronze Avalokitesivara now in the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery. Chapin thought it possible that the secondprince was the same person as the next king, elsewhere called Tuan Chih-hsing (the commissioner of the long roll). She pointed to the practise, "common in Indo- China (Champa and Cambodia)" of "prefixing to the name of a divinity the name of the reigning monarch who makes an image of" it; and reminded her readers of the closeproximity of Yiinnan to that region. She was, however, prudent enough to observe that she had seen "no other Yiinnanese examples of this practise"; and so put forward a more general alternative, based on Chinese terminology. Literally the characters might mean the epithet "easily excelling"; but on the basis of a Buddhist use recorded in the P'ei wen yiin fu dictionary of quotations, she preferred to think of it as a metaphor for spiritualperfection, " the ability to change short into long." Io The seventy- secondgroup" Avalokiteivara stands in a mountain landscape, above which are clouds in a blue sky, his feet on a grey lotus. He holds a willow spray in his right hand and a flask in his left. His aureole, which resembles a stone stela in shape, is gold in color, and his halo is grey. His flesh is gold. He wears a red robe and scarf; the folds are done in gold. To the right is a group of three figures, two attend-</page><page sequence="12">ants with chignons and an elaborately dressed individual holding a rosary in his left hand; on his robe is theya mark which is one of the symbols worn by the Chinese emperor. To the left is another group of three, two attendants like those opposite and a personage in gorgeous robes with a dragon design, holding a fan in his right hand. Since the dragon is also an imperial symbol, we may infer that these lords are two of the rulers of Y innan. This seems to me most unlikely, since they have the crowns, coiffures, and haloes of celestial beings. They are at the same time kings, for the two boy attendants given each hold up his long sleeves (in thefashion made familiar by the " Yen Li-pen" scroll of Chinese emperors in Boston). Presumably they are the two kings of the gods, Indra and Brahmd. In the foreground is water, with rocks to right and left and at the near edge of the picture. In the water are two snakes with their tails and necks intertwined to form a circle. To the right is a conch shell and to the left a fish with a wheel on its head. This same group of symbols is found at the end of the Y innanese roll formerly owned by Yamanaka and Company and as in the case offrame 89 refer to the legend of the Yfinnanese Hsi-erh River. The inscription to the left of the panel reads: Chiu-ku Kuan-shih-yin P'u-sa, i.e. Avalokites- vara Bodhisattva who saves from suffering. I 02 The seventy-thirdgroup: The Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, seated in the vajrdsana posture on a lotus throne done in black outline, supported by a cloud pedestal drawn the same way with the hour-glass silhouette of Mt. Sumeru. He has the regular number of forty arms, and two others besides which are raised behind the innermost halo and hold up the figure of Amitdbha Buddha in a red robe. Above, an elaborate canopy hangs in mid-air; a large, flame-encircled jewel is at the top, and a smaller one decorates each of the four visible upturned points of the (probably octagonal) roof of the canopy. From the end points on right and left depend decorated chains; and three smaller chains are festooned over the longer part of a double curtain which hangs from the base of the canopy. The outer aureole of the divinity is white with a narrow gold rim; it takes in the lotus but not the cloud pedestal. The inner aureole is also white and is edged with white flames. The halo, which backs the head, is red and has no flames. The elaborate headdress of Avalokitesvara contains a standing figure of the dhydni Buddha Amitdbha. Avalokite'vara, whose body is golden in color, wears a pale pink skirt, showing red at the folds, and over it a red scarf with gold folds. He is naked above the waist except for jewelry-anklets, bracelets on both upper and lower arms, necklace, earrings-and for two streamers of black hair which extend over his shoulders to the elbow. The attributes held and the mudrds formed are: 86</page><page sequence="13">Proper left Outer hands: I. Sun 2. Spear 3. Skull on stick 4. Conch shell from which issues a cloud, half hiding a snake 5.

To the proper left stands Vasu Rsi, with a staff like a shepherd's crook in his left hand, his right upraised to his forehead. He wears a white robe, and contrary to iconographical rules, gold and red jewelry.,1s To the proper right is Sri Mahddevi, holding a lotus. She wears a white robe and is decked out with a red and gold crown and a jewelled collar. In the foreground is a king (?), his hands in aijali mudrd.126 His skirt is much worn and shows underneath a fierce, red divinity, eight-armed, whose face and torso are hidden by the king, but whose arms are visible to each side. In spite of the evident fact that the king was painted afterward, over the "terrible one", this latter figure seems to be partially repainted. He is surrounded by flames done in black without a trace of color. In his proper upper left hand he holds a lasso (?); in the second, a single-pointed vajra; the third apparently rests on his left leg, which is in a cross- I25zs But compare the Vasu Rei in the lower part of a fresco painting of the "man.dala" of the Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara brought from Chotscho and now in the Museum fiir V61kerkunde, Berlin, illustrated in Chotscho, pl. 32. Vasu Rsi is there even more unlike what he is supposed to be than in the long roll. For a discussion of the meaning of the juxtaposition of Vasu Rsi and Sri Mahadevi, see Chapin, "Study", pt.II, pp. 195, 202-03 in Ost.Zeitschrift, n. F.XI, 5. z126 This is probably one of the rulers or princelets of Yiinnan. 87</page><page sequence="14">legged position; while the right leg is somewhat extended; the fourth and inner hand, hidden by the drawing of the king, probably made a mudrd with the corresponding hand on the other side. The upper right hand holds a three-pronged vajra; the second holds a rosary; the third makes a mudrd, and the inner fourth is hidden under the robes of the king. Attendant on this fierce divinity are two warriors of human shape, the one on the divinity's proper left having a pig's head over his own and the one opposite having an elephant's head over his human one. These figures are probably intended for the same personages we have seen else- where conceived somewhat differently, the one with the head of an elephant on a human body (Vindyaka) and the other with the head of a pig on a human body (Vajrinkusa); seeframe 93. The inscription to the left of the panel reads: Ta-pei Kuan-shih-yin P'u-sa, i.e. Mahdkarund the Great Compassionate Avalokite'vara Bodhisattva. I o3 The seventy-fourth group: Ekdda'amukha (Eleven-headed) Avalokite'vara. Above, among clouds, are two groups of [Chinese-style] weather gods. On the right is the rain dragon, done in monochrome. On the left are the thunder demon (Lei Shen or Lei Kung), with a circle of drums around his head; the wind god (Feng Shen or Feng Po); and the lightning goddess (?). The thunder demon has a pig's head and bat's wings; he holds a double drumstick in his right hand and a single one (?) in his left. The wind god is an old man who holds a tiger's-skin bag. The lady may be a rain goddess rather than the lightning goddess Lieh-chueh Mu, since she holds a willow branch in her right hand and huge jar in her left. The inscription at the upper left of the panel reads: Shih-i-men Kuan-shih-yin P'u-sa, or Ekddaiamukha Avalokiteivara Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva sits in vajrdsana posture on a grey lotus, which rests on a square throne. [Presumably because of the weather spirits above], there is no canopy. [Over thefront of the throne unrolls a rug or] opened scroll, drawn like the throne in outline, and empty. Avalokiteivara has two elab- orate aureoles, each with a conventional flower border and flames, also uncolored. Above the first tier of three heads, each with a third eye, he wears a crown, in which there is no dhydni Buddha. The topmost head is, as usual, that of Amitibha. The other ten probably indicate the Ten Direc- tions, and so illustrate this Bodhisattva's epithet, Samantamukha or "Facing Everywhere". The divinity wears a pink skirt, showing red at the folds; over it is a red scarf, gold at the folds. Another red scarf is draped over the shoulders. He is adorned with all the royal jewelry: earrings, bracelets, necklace, etc. His hair hangs over his shoulders. The attributes held in his sixteen arms and the mudrds formed are: Proper left Outer hands: i. Lamp balanced on stick (?) 2. Make a mudrd and hold a 3. lotus together Proper right Outer hands: I.

As they are dressed like the human beings represented in the paint- ing, however, they may very likely be the souls of specific dead persons. To the right are two ladies, each holding a torch; they are dressed in long, flowing robes and wear tiaras. To the left are two men and a boy; one of the men is heavily bearded, while the other has a smooth face; each holds a hu tablet. The boy holds a drum, of a type which seems to be peculiar to Yunnan; compare the Yuinnanese scroll formerly owned by Yamanaka and Company. All three are dressed in flowing robes, and the men wear small hats. That worn by the bearded man has lobes like lotus petals and is of the same kind as some of the hats in the Tun-huang paintings. As we shall see, the whole composition of this panel below its icon is an anthropomorphic chart of the Nan Chao rulers; it is not likely that the two men at upper left, strongly individualized and shown without haloes, should be anonymous. They must be, infact, the termini of a backward ex- tension of Nan Chao geneology, of which there is no hint in the Yamanaka-Fujii rolls. It is obvious that so long as there was an independent Yfnnanese kingdom, the first regime continued to be granted a unique status, centuries after it had beenpolitically superseded. To use a Chinese term, the Nan Chao had been granted a divine mandate to rule which their Ta Li successors made no attempt to match. At the same time a later age may well have been dissatisfied by the humble beginning of the story, by a Founder who was at the start nothing more than a peasant refugee. Perhaps under the Ta Li or Hou Li, then, a much more remote and awe-inspiring First Ancestor was added: no less a personage than the Emperor Aloka. It is probably he who is shown in the picture as a bearded, middle-aged man. The youth alongside must be the sonfrom whom the Yfn- nanese line sprang. In the Nan Chao yeh shih version of the story (Sainson,pp. 24-2 ) Aloka is said to have had nine sons who scattered over the world and became the ancestors of nine countries or tribes, China, Tibet, and Ceylon as well as the peoples of Yfnnan. I have already referred to another, more picturesque version in which there are three sons, who pursue their father's great white horse to central Yiinnan, where they settle down around Lake Tien, and beget the leading tribes of the region (told in the Chi ku Tien shuo, purportedly of late Southern Sung date; see my Foreword and Excursus, pp. 8-3;9). The next two registers are of great interest, since the personages represented are without doubt historic characters. Each one has a label; but unfortunately very few of the inscriptions are at all legible. In the first of these two registers, to the right, are three men, hands in anjali mudrd, dressed in white, each wearing a large black hat with streamers. This style of hat is perhaps peculiar to Yuinnan. The label accompanying the innermost figure is the only one which is at all legible. It 89</page><page sequence="16">reads: Ch'eng A (?) ch'eng M (?) p'ing , (?) ko r&amp; (?) ? ? I have not yet been able to establish the identity of this figure. Li Lin-ts'an, who has made a special study of this Nan Chao king chart, reads the label Wei Ch'eng Wang Ko T rg  ? ? the title of the third ruler. See his "Study", p.34. Nearer the center, toward which he faces, is a bareheaded young man with his hair done in a topknot, his hands in aijali mudrd. The accompanying inscription reads Hsing Tsung Sheng Lo-sheng M . This youth evidently represents Lo-sheng-yen (also written Lo-sheng), the son of Hsi-nu-lo the founder; shown probably before his father came to power in 649, since he is shown in ordinary clothes, rather than in those of a prince. On the other hand he is anachro- nistically given the title Hsing Tsung, which formed part of his posthumous title Shih Tsung Hsing Tsung Wang. He ruled from 674 and died in 7I2. The Sheng found here simply means "holy". Li Lin-ts'an concurs. Facing Lo-sheng, to the spectator's left, is a man in white with a black hat of Yiinnanese style, his hands in aijali mudrd. The inscription is all but illegible: I tentatively suggest: ? Fang X (?) Sheng a (?) Fang X (?) ?. I have not yet identified this man. Li reads: Ching Wang Sheng Ch'uian (?) Li i T- , aTJi / a combination which comes close to the given name and title of the ninth ruler. Next to him is a warrior in armor with a red helmet, his hands in anjali mudrd. In the inscription the only character at all clear is Huang, emperor. Li reads this Ching Chuang Huang Ti Shih-lung 'f  , a clear reference to the eleventh ruler. The third and last figure in the group of three is a monarch dressed in a long white robe with an elaborate, tall, red crown, his hands in aijali mudrd. His long sleeves have wide borders with a variation of the "thunder pattern" (Greek fret), and he wears the square, upturned shoes which were fashionable in T'ang China. The inscription reads: Hsiao Ai Chung Hsing Huang Ti * L *  4 . The hsiao is so worn as to be illegible, but the other characters are clear enough, so that there can be no doubt that this personage is Shun-hua-chen, the last ruler of Nan Chao (r. 897- 902). Ching Hsing is the name of the reign period which began one year after his accession, in 898, and perhaps continued to 902. Hsiao Ai Huang Ti is the posthumous title. It is interesting to note that this monarch is also represented, and clearly labelled, in the [Yamanaka-Fujii] picture scroll, and that it was in his reign, in 899, that the original of which the extant scroll is a copy, was painted. Li concurs. In the register in the immediate foreground, to the right, is a king whose flesh is white, in flowing robes with long sleeves and a tall red crown. He has borders on his sleeves like those of the preceding king. He also wears a collar of complicated design, possibly of jewelry, and striped shoes. His hands are in a~jali mudrd. He is attended on the proper left by a person of dark flesh color dressed in a white skirt, with a white scarf over his shoulders. He is adorned with anklets, 90</page><page sequence="17">89 88 8 Vilii -  &gt;: i::.,! &lt;  ., . :  ... .. V ... .......w fA At_ 7i!:~ii:!!14 !ii ;7f~i!;wo P1. 3 5 The long roll: Avalokite'vara of the Samantamukha Section, and as Savior from Perils</page><page sequence="18">':--:: iii:iii! :::~ ........ : zii????-iiiii-i:~~ '? -:i ~i~ii _i:i~i i:::-iE:;i:!iii- i~ -:-iii-si:i:-_il-_ iiiii iiiiiii -_! -- -!i;i!i i-iiiiii iiii--i-iiii i::iiiiiiiii i i-.j :':_:;iiiii-iiii;-:_ iii iii iiiiiii iiiii ~ 'i~ii-~i ii iiiiii-i~ i-iii:-i _--i::-iii iiiiiiiiiii-ii-ii iiiiiiiiiii-iii~ -~ ii- : __ i i - -ii iiiiiiiiiiiii cri: i-i;iiiii iii~: i iiii:iiiii-i-iiiiiiiii- i -I__ :iiiiii-i-_ :-::--iiiii-:i-iiii :::::: ::::::: : :--: Iiiii; 2;ii",i, i~:l-_i ':!i: I-::i!lri;l:: - I-- i iiiiiiiiiii iii i~iiiiiiiiiiiiiii: i ii~iii _:ii-i iiiii:i :!iiii-iiiiiiii-iiiiiiii_- iii i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-iiiiii :Yil iiiiii~iii~ili!ii~iii'i~i~iiiiiiii~i~iii}'ii~i ... iiiii!iiiiiiiiiii! ii iiiiiiiii? iiii-ii %iii!!!!!!iiii _ :i~i::-i-ii- i i- i~i: iiiiii i- !!iiii-!!,i: i !iiiiiiiiiiiiiill i i-ii,! ii;?iiiii iiii  :- -iiii i:-:-i--i--:i-:'jr-:.!:--:iii~~iiiiii--:::i o 4W11 APd Itd iiiiii-iiiii ii i_ oC iii-iiiiiiiii~i iiii-:i~iiiii--i  -i ii- eT o . t w 7, z Alp iiiiiziiiiiii!i;;i-i i.i!iiii~iii~iiiiiiiiiii~iiiiiiiii~iii!iiiiiiiii@i~iiiii~~~~ iiii@iiiii~ii ii~i~liiiiiiiiiiiiiiill!ii~iiiiiiii~liiiiii ~ !iiiiiiiiiiii~ iiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii iiii iili i~~~ i "iA'll" . !i~ i~iiii .iiiiiii</page><page sequence="19">95 94 93 .. ..- - ii ...........:)i:: (I, ii i 1 "Sat iNri P1. 37 The long roll: The Thousand-armed Avalokite'vara; Avalokitegvara Amoghapdsa; and Avalokite'vara as Savior from Diseases</page><page sequence="20">98 97 96 . t: v - X : i: -i:i:_ i:: :. : . --...-ii ,iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, i;{i i:=iJ. ...'.. :i ic~f lit 1A1 ... . . .. -:-iiiii!i iii :: : :iii~ -:  ai ~iii iii ii~iiii P ii :  : i : : : i i-i  '' :i ,- i i i ii i iiii~ ii~ ii'i~iiiiiii , , I' ii :  ~ Bi iiii:- -i-i . ii ii iii~~aii .. .. . ...iii ii f ? ,i, ....... .. . . .. .. .... .. . . . .... . .  ......  . ... . .. ... . .... . .... .. ........ .. ......  - ... ..... ... ................ ... ... . ... .. . . . . ........ . ..... . ... ,~ ~~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~  :,:' : ,i, ,  , !,,,ij,, ....... .... ..... .....    ' , ,i i Pl. 38 The long roll: The goddess Jambhali; Avalokite'vara of Mount Potalaka, and as Sole and Supreme Farther Shore</page><page sequence="21">101 100 99 i:- JV; .::.

His hands are in anjali mudrd. There are two smaller attendants, dressed in white, each with hands in [the same] mudrd. The inscription to the left of the king with the tall crown reads: Chao Ch'eng Huang Ti ? ? ? as A g? ? . So worn are the characters following ti that it is even uncertain whether there are two or three. The monarch can be identified, however. He is Feng-yUi, who reigned 824-5 9, and whose posthumous title was Chao Ch'eng Wang. Li concurs, adding tentatively a character Lieh J5 before Feng-yi. He was the tenth ruler. The bareheaded man, who is also barefoot, is evidently a ruler too, because the only legible characters above his head are Huang Ti. Li reads: Wu Hsiian Huang Ti jt &amp; E , presumably theposthumous title of the twelfth ruler; in the Nan Chao yeh shih the order of thefirst two characters is reversed. The inscriptions accompanying the two attendants, who are probably princes rather than attendants, are so rubbed and worn as to be indecipherable. Li sees just enough to identify them as the wives of thefirst two Meng, pere et fils, the latter on the outside. To the spectator's left, proceeding from the center of the picture outward, is [first] a man dressed in white, with his legs bound in cloths, as if for horseback riding. His feet are bare. His hair is dressed in a topknot, and he carries against his breast something which seems to have a beak and wings. The inscription is illegible. Li reads: Ch'i Wang Hsi-nu-lo  E g , the title and name of the first ruler; the bird isperhaps a reference to the one that flew down onto his shoulderfrom the iron pillar. Behind him, also facing toward the center, are three men, each in a white robe with a red girdle and a tall black hat with streamers, with hands in anjali mudri. The first inscription is very worn; possibly the second character is Tsung 9. The first has the heart radical and may possibly be Hsi g; the third may be Wu A. I do not venture a guess on the fourth, and have not been able to identify this ruler. Li reads: T'ai Tsung Wu Wang Sheng ? ? t A 3 T A?? whichr seems to be a reference to the third ruler (whosepersonal name as given in the Nan Chao yeh shih begins with Sheng 2 , a homophone) . In the next label the first two characters are Shen Wu a R. Shen Wu Wang was the posthu- mous title of Ko-lo-feng, (r. 748-778). Li makes the fourth character the same Feng R. This was the fifth king. The last inscription is almost completely worn away and I cannot read it. It looks very much to me as if someone, with malice aforethought, had tried to obliterate these names of Yfinnanese monarchs. Li reads: ? Wu g ? TzU 9 Ku (?) W I07</page><page sequence="34">Chapin left untouched thefarther two labels at the upper rght. Li reads the frst of these ? Wu Sheng ? ? ? o ? ? ?. The second he makes: Hsiao Huan Wang I? Hs//n W ? 4. This last is a clear indication of the sixth ruler. It looks as if the figures were ranged in thefollowing order of reigns: 13 11 9 2 4 6 ' 7 3 1 1o 12 This is not quite borne out by Li's readings of the labels. No.7 does not correspond at all. Where no. 8 should be, wefind instead king no. 6. In the no. 6position are characters that seem to fit in nowhere. In the no. 4position the titlepoints toward no. 3, but the first character of the name points toward no. /. On the other hand these discrepancies may be explained in at least three ways. Li may have mis-read one or more characters; (2) the scribe who wrote in the names on the "long roll" in the 170o's, under a different dynasty, may have been careless, or had a defective list to copy; (3) the nomenclature given in the Nan Chao yeh shih may befaulty, or at least misleading. Sofar as the kings' personal names are concerned, it checks very closely with the Nan Chao chapters in the New T'ang History, T'ang shu, ccxii, I-2. The latter, on the other hand, records noposthumous titles until the eleventh reign. In the Chi ku Tien shuo version of the history, the frst ninepersonal names are written in ways which differpartl~ or wholly. They are, however, homophones; and since the names were non-Chinese, they may well have been rendered by different phonetic equivalents at different times, for differentpurposes. The Nan Chao yeh shih/T'ang shu version may well be the result of a formula for transcription adopted by the Chinese annalists, to insure uniformity. As for Chapin's suggestion that the labels were at some time deliberately defaced, it seems more likely that they suffered unequally from the wetting-down the roll received in 1449; and that the restorer who rewrote many of the other labels left them alone. Io04 The seventy-ffth group: Vairocana Buddha, whose flesh is white, dressed in a plain red robe edged with gold, sits in vajrdsana on a lotus drawn in black and white which rests on a square pedestal. A whitish scarf depends from the rear of his elaborate crown and shows at the side of each arm. His hands form the mystic mudrd called chih ch'Aanyin, to # F, "knowledge-fist mudrd". 127The left forefinger is held within the closed right fist. The meaning of this mudrd is the unity of the two worlds, the Diamond Cycle and the Womb Cycle, or the Buddha worlds and the human worlds.las This 127 I do not know the Sanskrit for this mudrad. In Indian Buddhism Vairocana's mudra seems to be the dharmacakra; see Bhat- tacharyya, Iconography, pp. 2-4 and pl. VII, fig. d. I cannot remember ever having seen any Indian Buddhist image exhibiting this "knowledge-fist" mudrd; it is possible that it was invented in Central Asia or China. The T'ang dynasty wooden image of Vairocana in the temple Tashadaiji, Nara, makes this mudrd, as does a bronze image of about the same date in the temple Bukkokuji [i.e. Pulguksa in Kyongiu, SW Korea]. For a detailed description and explanation of the mudra see Mikky6 daYijiten, p. 1589; also Saunders, Mudrd, pp. o2-o7. He also knows of no Indian examples]. 128 The doctrine of the Two Cycles or Ryjbu Mandara was brought to Japan from China in 807 by Kdkai, (Kab6 Daishi), who established the Shingon sect in Japan. So far as I am aware, no one has discovered the origin of these particular mandalas, which I believe are used at present only in Japan. [A CS] : This is still true, but for references to more recent studies see "A long roll", II, p. i 69. The monumental remains of the earliest preserved pair in Japan, executed in gold and silver paint on dark purple silk ca. 8, o by imperial order andpreserved in the Kyto temple Jingiji, have been published in a magnificent album with an excellent text by Takata, Osamu; Akeyama, Terukazuu; and Yanagisawa, Taka, under the title Takao mandara no kenkyo (with English summary), Tokyo, ip 67. This is reviewed by Soper in AA, XXXII, I. 1970, pp. 9 o-) . 10o8</page><page sequence="35">mudrdis peculiar to Vairocana, so far as I know, and is his as the main figure in the Diamond Cycle man.dala, the Vajradhdtu. In our painting, Vairocana is encircled by a pale red, round halo, gold-edged, the red fading out near the body of the Buddha. The inner halo is colorless, edged with flame done in outline. Clouds issue from the top of the red halo. Among the clouds to the right, is an Apsaras with a dish of flowers; opposite, is an Apsaras with an unidentified object in each hand. In front of the throne is an empty offering table. To the right, is a personage in a robe like a monk's done in outline, wearing a red crown and holding an incense burner in his left hand. To the left stands a similar figure, holding a vase containing a lotus flower, a leaf and a bud. These are probably monarchs who entered the order, like the Emperor Wu of Liang.,19 It is possible that they represent Su Lung who reigned over the kindgom of Ta Li from i0o22 to io26, when he became a monk and gave the throne to the son of one of his brothers, who ruled as Su Chen until Io041, when he became a monk.I19 As in the case of frame zor this suggestion seems to me very unlikely. The two figures have haloes and the coiffure type of celestial beings, in spite of their monk's robes. I believe that they are gods whose total devotion to Buddhism is stressed by their costume. The inscription to the left of the panel reads: Nan-wu Pi-lu-che-na Fo, i.e. Adoration to Vairocana Buddha. In this case a transliteration of the Sanskrit name is given, whereas in the other earlier representation of this Buddha, the name was rendered by a translation as Ta Jih, Great Sun. Io5 The seventy-sixthgroup: A form of Avalokiteivara, three-headed and six-armed, who stands with each foot on a faded pink lotus. The lotuses rest on clouds. He is dressed in flowing red robes. His main head has a moustache and goatee. His two other heads show a tendency toward fierceness; the noses are rather snub. In his yellow-gold crown is a seated figure of the dhyini Buddha Amitdbha. He has two haloes, with no rims, each edged with red flames. Above, a lotus canopy is suspended. It now appears to be done in outline, but perhaps its color has faded. Below, is an expanse of water, in the center of which is a bird-man (Garuda?) somewhat resembling the Japanese Tengu [type of demon]. To the right, apparently on the shore, is a figure the crown of whose head is shaven, standing in adoration. To the left is a monk on top of the waves, with shaven head and stubbly beard, also in adoration. The attributes and mudrds are: Proper left Proper right I. Cloud supporting sun I. Cloud supporting moon 2. Rectangular mirror 2. Flame-girdled sword 3. Small dish 3. Willow (?) spray 129 Nan Chaoyeh shih, Fr., p. 93. The Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502-49) ruled the kingdom even after he had become a monk; and the wearing of crowns by these two monks may indicate a similar state of affairs; or it may simply indicate that they had [once] been kings. iog</page><page sequence="36">The inscription to the upper left reads ? ? -tsang P'u-sa. This no doubt applies to the central figure of the next group, who is Ksitigarbha, with the Chinese name Ti-tsang; the first two characters must be Nan-wu. I06 The seventy-seventh group: Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, closely resembling several of his representations at Tun-huang, is seated on a square throne, the seat of which is supported by pillars resting on a square base. He is in lalita~sana, his right leg pendent, resting on a pale maroon lotus, near which is an empty pink lotus in readiness to bear his left foot. The top of the throne, which has no back, is pink. All the colors are pastel shades. Above is suspended in mid-air a lotus canopy with hanging jewelled garlands. In back is a big round blue halo, within which is a smaller pink halo encircling the head of the divinity. He is dressed in pale yellow robes and has a pale maroon scarf over his head, which forms a hood and extends over both shoulders. As in the Tun-huang paintings 1ao-in which he has the hood as well-, his monk's costume is enlivened by a necklace. He holds in his right hand the long monk's staff and in the other, the jewel, his usual attributes. Lotus and other flowers appear to right and left of the throne. The offering table is partly hidden by the large blue haloes of his two attendants, who are replicas of himself with variations. In the centre of the table is a tall incense burner (?) with two smaller ones to right and left. The attendant to the proper left, Ksitigarbha again, is seated in lalitdsana, his left leg pendent. On this foot is a sandal, while the other, which is horizontally placed, though not in the dhydna or vajra posture with sole upwards, is bare, its sandal resting empty on the base of the throne. The throne is placed on a square mat with a pleated edge or border. The divinity is dressed in maroon, yellow and pink. The scarf over his head is without color (?). His inner halo is a very pale yellow, and the outer one, blue. His right hand holds a large jewel and his left, what seems to be a ball of crystal. To the left, is another figure of Ksitigarbha, wearing a low, jewelled tiara, a red skirt and a yellow monk's robe. He wears also a necklace, bracelets and anklets. He sits in bhadrdsana on an armless seat, of which only the elaborate legs are visible. Each foot rests on a lotus, while underneath is a narrow lotus base. In his proper right hand, he holds a long staff, and in the left, a transparent jewel or ball of crystal. I07 The seventy-eighth group: Mgrici devi, with three heads (each of which has three eyes, the proper right head being a pig's)Ias and six arms, stands on a green lotus, drawn by seven [miniature] pigs. On the same lotus stand two female attendants on right and left, half hidden by the goddess; each with a bow and ar- row, aiming at a demon who kneels below. The fact that they are on the same lotus indicates that they are really Marici herself or very close emanations of her. The dwarfs represent the demons of darkness at which as Goddess of the Dawn she sends her arrows of light. Mirici is dressed in white with long sleeves, ruffled at the elbows. In her crown (seated accord- 130 See for example Stein, looo Buddhas, pl.XXV; Serindia, pl. LXII; and Hackin and others, Asiatic Mythology, p. 249 fig. 5. 13I Mdrici's one pig face is usually on her left; see Bhattacharyya, op. cit., pl. XXX, fig. c, and XXXI, fig. a. II0</page><page sequence="37">ing to the rule) is the dhydni Buddha Vairocana, of whom she is an emanation.1a3 She is adorned with jewelry, and her crown is large and complicated; back of it her hair rises like a high tower. The attributes held are: Proper left Proper right i. Loop of a lasso i. Three-pronged vajra, held up 2. Two lotus flowers 2. Other end of lasso 3. Bow 3. Arrow A common form of Mdrici has three faces and eight arms, the two missing here usually holding a needle and a thread. None of the forms listed by Bhattacharyala3 exactly corresponds to the image in the Palace Museum scroll. In the foreground to the right is a red, hairy man, wearing a white loincloth, who stands with both arms upraised, his hair standing on end. Opposite him, to the left, is a woman, whose flesh is gold in color, dressed in a pink skirt and a white scarf, draped around her hips, seated astride a donkey. Her head is turned toward the red man and she has a vexed expression. She wears anklets, bracelets and a necklace. I have not yet been able to identify these attendants, either the two shooting arrows or the man and woman. Bhattacharyaa34 lists four attendant goddesses and cites a case in which three only are shown; but neither in his description nor in the images illustrated are any corresponding to the man and woman. The other two may possibly belong to the group of four goddesses. Mdrici has an enormous red halo edged with blue flames, which rises from the lotus pedestal on each side, though hidden by the man and woman. The inner part of the halo is elliptical, but the outer part, i. e., the outline of the flame, is shaped like a lotus leaf. Above is a canopy of three large flowers, from which hang chains or garlands. I 08 The seventy-ninth group: The "Five Esoteric Ones", Paficaguhya,1s3 Samantabhadra and four other Bodhisattvas seated on a huge lotus (done in outline) within a white disk on a cloud pedestal. The inscription at the right side of the panel reads: Nan-wu Pi-mi Wu P'u-hsien, i.e. Adoration to the Samanta- bhadra of the Esoteric Five. At the center of the supporting pillar of cloud is a disk containing a five-pointed vajra, standing on end. Samantabhadra's body is golden. He sits cross-legged in the center of the lotus, toward the rear. In his right hand, balanced on his middle finger and supported by his thumb, he holds a three or five-pronged vajra; and in his left he holds upside down a gha2n.td bell, with a three or five- pronged vajra. The ghan.td and the hand are turned outward. This is neither the vajrahurikara nor the trailokyavijaya mudrda 36 It is, however, found very often in Japanese Shingon images of Vajra- a32 Ibid., p. 93" a33 Ibid., pp.95-Ioo. 134 Ibid., p.98; see also p. 99 and pls. XXX, XXXI. Sas I have coined this Sanskrit name. Neither Bukky daijiten nor Mikky6 daijiten in their accounts of the group gives a Sanskrit equivalent for the Chinese term (inJapanese Gohimitsu). 136 Bhattacharyya, op. cit., p. 198. III</page><page sequence="38">sattva and Samantabhadra,a17 as is the similar position with bell handle up and the hand turned inward.1a8 Samantabhadra wears an elaborate crown in which are small images of the Five Dhyini Buddhas. A lock of hair falls over each shoulder. He wears a pale pink skirt and a scarf over the left shoulder. He has anklets, bracelets, upper and lower necklaces, and earrings. Behind him, their heads showing over his shoulders, are two Bodhisattvas. One knee of each shows, that of one to the right of Samantabhadra's knee, and that of the other, to the left. The one at the right is flesh-colored and holds a pole with a fish on its top. He wears a pink skirt and white scarf. On his head is an elaborate crown, 39 and one lock of hair flows over his left shoulder. The Bodhisattva to the left (proper right) is of a fairer flesh-color and has his arms clasped around Samantabhadra's body. He is dressed in a similar fashion. Further to Samantabhadra's left is another of the group, seated in mahdraj-alildidsana, his left knee raised. Both hands make mudrd. He is dressed in a light yellow skirt and scarf, with yellow jewelry. His headdress is less elaborate than those of the two Bodhisattvas who peek out over Samantabhadra's shoulders. The fifth member of the group is seated opposite in the same dsana and is dressed similarly. He holds an arrow in both hands, the feathered tip in his right hand and the point in his left. Samantabhadra is consider- ably larger than the others; and the two Bodhisattvas described first are larger than the two who sit in the foreground of the lotus to right and left. According to both the Bukkyj6 Dajiten and the Mikkyj Daiiten,14o each one should wear a crown bearing the Five Dhydni Buddhas. Here, apparently Samantabhadra is the only one who fulfils the requirement. These figures are all seated on a large lotus above which is a blue halo edged with flames, the whole enclosed in a large white halo which rests on the cloud stand described above. At the very top of the picture is draped a white curtain, from which hang jewelled garlands. Below are the Four Guardian Kings, seated on [conventionalized] rocks, Vaisravana with bright red hair holding a pagoda in his left hand and a mace in his right, in the immediate foreground to the left. This group of the Mysterious Five occurs in paintings of the Shingon sect in Japan, for exam- ple, in a painting owned by Daigoji, and in one owned by Ninnaji, both Shingon temples in Kyato. Two other examples of which I know are in private collections in Japan: These are de- scribed in the Biutsu Kenkyf,32 according to the manner of the Shingon sect: i. e. the central figure is said to be Vajrasattva, and the Bodhisattvas are (in the order of my description above) named Ai I, Love; Man ,f, Sloth or Pride; Ch'u IQ, Anger; and Yii A, Desire or Lust.14I When the central figure is Samantabhadra, the four others receive the following names: Ai Chin-kang N lg, literally Love Vajra; Chin-kang Man Tsun N jIJ # ~, Vajra Pride Honored- 137 See the Bijutsu kenkya, no. 32, Tokyo, 1934, pls. II, XI. Here in both cases the vajra is held obliquely and the bell with its handle up. See also the Bukky6 daijiten, II, p. Iz273, text figure, and Mikky6 daijiten, I, p. 629, text figure. In both these cases also the vajra is held obliquely and the bell handle up. In the latter case the three figures in the center are in a rowv, Ai (with the fish on a pole) rising from behind Vajrasattva, and Man seated in front of him. Each of the five bears on his breast the Sanskrit syllable that is his bija mantra (for which see infra). 38as As in the Nepalese image illustrated in ibid., pl.IX, fig.b, and described p. 6. 139 My notes do not mention the five Dhydni Buddhas in the crowns of any except the central figure; and I cannot see any in my small photograph, even with a magnifying glass [A CS]: Nor can I. The outer two figures, in any case, have tiaras too small for any such emblems. 140 See note 137 above. 141 Mikky6 daijiten, p. 629, gives the Sanskrit of which this name is a transliteration as Kelikila, which it says means the same as ch'u, i.e. anger. II2</page><page sequence="39">one; Ch'i-li-ch'i-lo Tsun  R 4 , a transliteration of the Sanskrit Kelikila; and Yi* Chin- kang N i lJ, Lust Vajra.142 In both cases the central figure, whether Vajrasattva or Samantabhadra, represents the Bodhi- citta, and the other four stand for klesa, passions. The white circle including all the figures sym- bolizes PrajfiA, Wisdom, by and through and in which human passions become the Bodhicitta, the Will toward Enlightenment. It is interesting to note the mantra for this group, five syllables for the five divinities, is "Om Mahisukha".143 We have here a striking instance of the Tantric doctrine that the phenomenal and noumenal are One; and that the same things (passions or practises) that sometimes act as spiritual poisons may, when properly understood and controlled, lead to Enlightenment. Before leaving this interesting group, I may note the correspondence of these five crowned and royally decked figures, who are all really one and the same, with either Vajrasattva or Samanta- bhadra who are both sometimes regarded as Adi-Buddha, at their center, and the group of Five Dhydni Buddhas [or Fivefinas], having the crowned Adi-Buddha Vairocana at the center. The correspondence is especially striking in the case of the example given in the text figure on page 629 of the Mikkyj daiiten, Vol. I; in which the figures are so arranged that each one of the four subsidiary Bodhisattvas takes a place consonant with one of the four directions, while Vajrasattva occupies the center. So far as I am aware, this example of the Five Esoteric ones-for which I have coined the Sanskrit name, apparently not recorded, of Pafncaguhya-in the Palace Museum roll is the only Chinese representation of the subject known. It is of course possible that others may turn up, either in the collections owned by temples in Japan, in the Palace Museum collection itself- whose treasures have not been thoroughly sifted-or somewhere else. Meanwhile it is something to have one example to place beside the Japanese paintings of the same subject. Io9 The eightieth group: A single-headed, six-armed divinity is seated in lalitdsana on a white lotus which rests on eight jars containing jewels. The inscription at upper right reads: Chin ssu liu pei P'o-ssu t'o-lo Fo-mu, i.e. the Gold-colored, Six-armed P'o-su Tri, Buddha-Mother. I have not yet identified this form of Tiri. It is evident that she is a goddess of good fortune, especially of wealth. Chapin was caught off-guard by this label, probably because she waspleased to discover at least one Tadrad among the odd assortment of Tantric deities in the long roll. P'o-ssu is a standard equivalent for the Sanskrit Vasu, and P'o-ssu-t'o-lo can hardly be anything but Vasudhdra. A Bodhisattva so named in Sanskrit is discussed under a better known Chinese equivalent, Ch'ih Shih jt 4 (inJapanese fise) in Bukkyo daijiten, P. 35 9o, and Mikkya daijiten, P. 955. The deity "rains treasures". Each dictionary provides a text figure from one of the Japanese iconographical sketch-books; both are much more conventional than the long roll version. 142 Bukkyj daijiten, p. I273. The group with Samantabhadra as central figure is probably that used by the Tendai sect in Japan, but it by no means follows that the corresponding Chinese representation, as for example in the long roll, was used by the [parent] T'ien-t'ai sect in China. 143 See note 137 above. 144 See Bhattacharyya, op. cit., pp. 2, 6, and Getty, Gods of Northern Buddhism, p.46. 113</page><page sequence="40">The deity's right foot is pendent, resting on a lotus which is on top of two of the jars. Above are four dwarfs, two on each side. One of each pair has a jar of jewels, which the other is trying to get, holding the topknot of the first with his right hand and brandishing a club with his left. Scattered on the ground around the eight jars are all kinds of jewels, coral, a lotus, two conch shells, etc. In the foreground, to the spectator's right, is a man, naked except for a lotus-petal girdle (which does not hide his penis), with the head of a horned ram, standing with a bag in his arms and over his shoulder, from which issues a stream of jewels. To the left is a woman also standing, naked except for a lotus-petal girdle (which does not hide theyoni or kteis), a necklace, one anklet on her right ankle, and a red scarf slung over her right shoulder. She holds what is probably a large cornucopia from which issues a stream of jewels. The main divinity is gold in color. She wears a red skirt, a maroon jacket, with maroon oversleeves to the elbow, and white undersleeves extending to the wrist. She wears anklets, a necklace, earrings, and an elaborate red crown. There are two haloes, the larger of which, shaped like a lotus petal, rises from the top of the lotus seat; while the smaller, slightly elliptical, encircles the head of the divinity. It hides the top of the larger halo. Both have lotus petal borders, edged with flames outlined in red. At the top of the smaller is a jewel. The attributes held and mudrds formed are: Proper left Proper right i. Jewel, tripartite i. Makes a form of dharmacakra mudrd (?) 2. Vase containing flowers 2. Vase containing branch (?) 3. Bow 3. Arrow i i o The eighty-firstgroup: [Probably identifiable as] Dharmapiramitd Bodhisattva, the divinity stands on two lotuses done in outline. She holds a long-stemmed white (or uncolored?) lotus in both hands; the left arm is bent at the elbow. She wears an elaborate gold crown decorated with flaming jewels, in which is a standing figure of her dhydni Buddha, Amitabha, on a red lotus.I45 Dharmaparamitd wears the many kinds of jewelry appropriate to a Bodhisattva. Her pink underskirt is draped at the knees, and over it she wears a very pale, grey-green overskirt with a pale yellow lining. A maroon under-vest shows in front. She has only one halo, round and pale blue; from it rises a white cloud. In the background are a [garden] rock [with potholes] and peonies in bloom. In the foreground are two peacocks, one to the divinity's proper left [having] his tail behind her. The inscription on the same panel to the upper right reads: Nan-wu Lien-hua-Pu Mu, i.e. Adoration to the Mother of the Lotus-flower Section. The Lien-hua-Pu is one of five sections in the Vajradhitu Mandala, and the Pu Mu or Section Mother associated with it is Dharmaparamita Bodhisattva. 46 I45 Mikky3 daijiten, p. 2028. 146 Ibid., p. 631. The five Sections and their lords are: Fo pu, or Buddha-kula; Vairocana Buddha. Chin-kang pu, or Vajra-kula; Aksobhya Buddha. Pao (or Mo-ni) pu, or Mani-kula; Ratnasambhava Buddha. Lien-hua pu, or Padma-kula; Amitdyus/Amitdbha. Chieh (or Chieh-lu)-ma pu, or Karma-kula; Amoghasiddhi Buddha. II4</page><page sequence="41">The situation is not quite so clear as this, as a more careful reading of Chapin's source, Mikky6 daijiten, p. 631, should have shown. Both of the twin mandalas used inJapan may be analysed in terms either offive or of three sections. The connection with this Bodhisattva figure seems closer in the case of the Garbhaddtu or Tai.zkai, since the so-called Lotus-flower Section there comprises the areas containing the manifestations of Avalokitelvara/Kannon and Ksitigarbhaj/fiz. Ibid. p. 23 o. under Renge Bu Mo names Dharmapdramitj as the Mother when the mandala division is five-part, and the White-robed Avalokitelvara when it is three-part. Ibid., p. 2028 describes theformer deity in iconographic terms totally unlike those of the long roll icon. Ibid., pp. I 877-76, is closer in speaking of a standing form as one of the permissible varieties of the White-robed Kannon. Perhaps the color of the robe given the long roll's figure should be the chief determining factor. The name Dharmapdramitd means, "The Dharma [or Law] as a means of crossing to the other shore."14 The inclusion of this divinity in the long roll is significant. We may legitimately infer that the Vajradhdtu and Garbhako'adhdtu mandalas were known in Y innan in the twelfth cen- tury.48 And, as I have remarked before, the iconography of this long roll is that of the Buddhism of the T'ang dynasty in China, i.e. the Buddhism which reached its climax under the T'ang and lingered on here and there with more or less vigor during succeeding centuries up at least the end of Sung. It would have been moreprudent topoint out here that this is much too slender evidence on which to argue that these two mandalas in theforms in which they are known today-those of the Japanese Kongjkai and Tai.zkai-- were used in Yfinnan. iii The eighty-secondgroup. The inscription on the upper left edge of the previous panel probably refers to this one. It reads: Nan-wu Tzu-[i] Chin-kang Tsang, i. e. Adoration to Tzu- i Vajragarbha. I do not know the divinity or divinities referred to, and I cannot find the name Tzu Chin-kang Tsang in either the Bukky daiiten or the Mikkyj daijiten. None of the three divinities corresponds to the representa- tions of the Bodhisattva Vajragarbha or of Astottarasata-bhuja Vajradhara (Chin-kang Tsang Wang P'u-sa).149 Chapin missed the character i in her note-taking, but her remarks still hold. Three divinities are seated on grass on a dais which rests on a rock shaped like Mount Sumeru. To the spectator's right is the sun and opposite, on the other side of the rock, the moon. Rising from the end of each side of the dais, is a hemispherical blue halo, edged with colorless flames, which encloses the three divinities. Above, at the top of the picture, is an egg and dart [or rather a lotus petal] border, from which hangs a curtain looped up in three loops, with hanging garlands. Between the curtain and the halo are two circles, in each of which is a figure, the one to the spec- tator's right kneeling, the other kneeling with his head to the ground. :47 For further details see ibid., p. 2028. 48s The Lien-hua pu is [also] one of the three sections of the Garbhakosadh5tu mandala, which are: Fo pu, Lien-hua pu, and Chin-kang pu. [ACS]: But see my addition to Chapin's text with reference to this icon. 149 Ibid., pp. 702-03; Bukkyj daiiten, pp. 1337-37. 115</page><page sequence="42">The central figure of the trinity, seated in vajrdsana on grass, has an appearance similar to re- presentations of Vajrasattva and of Samantabhadra. He holds a three (or five?) pointed vajra balanced on the thumb and two middle fingers of his right hand, while in his left, he has a ghanta bell. He wears an elaborate crown, grey in color, and his hair flows over his shoulders. He has on gold earrings, necklace, bracelets, upper and lower, and anklets; he is naked to the waist except for this jewelry. He wears a pink skirt and a white scarf. He has the rpnd, and his flesh is white. To the right is a divinity with skin ofa pinkish flesh color, seated in vajrdsana on grass, holding a blue (?) lotus. He wears a white skirt and is naked above the waist except for jewelry-necklace, arm- lets, bracelets, earrings, etc. His hair flows over his shoulders. On his head is a small crown. To the left is a divinity whose skin is of a yellowish flesh color, dressed like the preceding, who holds a naked sword in his right hand and a roll (?) in his left.1s0 The rock, which resembles Mount Sumeru, rises out of blue water, on which float three indeterminable objects. On a smaller rock to the right sits a feminine divinity (Sri Mahddevi?) holding a white lotus in her left hand and making varada mudrli with her right. The "objects" are the same geometrical symbolsfor the continents in the cosmic ocean that we have met before in frames 78-80. I think itjustpossible that these three figures, throned on Mount Sumeru, are one of the very rare Buddhist representations of the Hinduist triad, Brahmd, Visp.u, and Siva, under the name of the " Three Brothers". If so, the most meaningful element in the picture would be the semicir- cular aureole behind them. Mikky6 daijiten, pp. 780o-I, under San Kyjdai, illustrates a version said to have been brought back from T'ang China by the Shingon student-monk Shbei r (8o9-84) in 8(7. This is an iconographical drawing with no setting indicated and the figures arranged with the formality of a mandala, the middle one close to the top of the semicircle. They are characterized as benign deities, only one-Brah~ad?-having four heads andfour arms; the attributes are no closer to Hinduist conventions than those in the long rollpicture. This suggestion is obviously not helped by the label that speaks of a "Wealth-increasing Vajragarbha". That however is located in the nextframe to the right. At the upper left edge of the triad'sframe are the illegible remains of another label, which may have given the proper title. Perhaps this is one of the places where remounting disturbed the original sequence. Attendant on her is a small figure whose head is like a jewel in a lotus. On another rock, to the left, sits a warrior (Vai'rdvana?), holding a sword in his right hand and a jewel in his left. Attend- ant on him is a small person with a head like a vegetable. x 2 The eighty-thirdgroup: The inscription at the upper right reads: Nan-wu? -yii-li Kuan-yin, i. e. Adoration to? -yti-li Avalokiteivara. I have not identified this form of Avalokiteivara, which as imaged here has some of the characteristics of a dragon king. The divinity has three human heads, each with a third eye, 150 It may be noted that the blue lotus, utpala, is an attribute of Mafijusri. The description of the divinity to the left fits Ara- pacana Mafijuiri except for the color of the body (see Bhattacharyya, op. cit., p. 28 and pl. XVII, figs. a, b, c). I remember very well a form of Mafijusrl holding the sword, the color of whose body was yellow, called Kumdrabhata Mafiju'ri, but I am at present unable to track him down. It is possible that the two minor members of the trinity are forms of Mafijugri. The roll, of course, would then be the Prajtaparamita suftra. II6</page><page sequence="43">six arms and two legs. Above his human heads are seven snakes' heads, each crested with a jewel; and he has a long snake's tail. He wears bracelets, armlets, anklets, a necklace, and a girdle com- posed of small snakes. His earrings, however, are of gold. Over his left shoulder is slung a snake's skin. He wears an elaborate gold crown in which is a seated image of his dhyadni Buddha, Amitdbha. His flesh is uncolored. He wears a short red skirt, with the skin of some animal over it as a girdle, above which is a girdle of snakes. He stands on a white lotus, the petals of which are edged with crimson. The lotus rests on crowds of snakes. The divinity has a large red halo edged with colorless flames. Within the halo are eight Buddhas (standing for past, present, and future?), each holding an object closely resembling a human hand. At the top of the halo is a jewel. Above is a colorless canopy of three flowers, with hanging gar- lands. Thre attributes and mudrds are: Proper left Proper right I. Makes a mudrd with raised index finger i. Three or five-pronged vaira, raised aloft 2. Spray of flowers 2. Naked sword 3. Bow 3. Arrow What may be read of the Chinese name, and the visible characteristics of the deity, identify her-not him-asJdngul, a Tantric manifestation of Avalokiteivara and aform of Tara. The dictionariesgive her name in several otherphonetic ways, among which only the li component is the same. She is agoddess who dispelspoison, including snake venom. Several descriptions are quoted in Mikky6 daijiten, pp. 1128-2y, the closest being taken from a work translated in zzo0 by the Sungpriest Fa-hsien a I, the Yoga-mahdtantra-rdja sitra (Nanjio, no. z022). Thepassage runs: "Jdngull Bodhisattva has the aspect of a boy, with seven Ndga heads, and crowned with the Buddha Aksobhya. His countenance is angry. A large Ndga hangs round his waist; he sits on a lotus; his body isgolden in hue and emits a red aureole. He has six arms and three heads, each with three eyes. On his right the first hand holds a vajra, the second holds a sword; the third makes a dance gesture while holding an arrow. On his left the frst hand holds a lasso while making the mudra of extermination; the second holds a visakha; the third holds a bow." (Since the passage contains no reference to the feminine gender, I have rendered thepersonalpronouns to suit the normal connotation of Bodhisattva.) What I have called "the mudra of extermination" is described in ibid., p. 238 under the heading kikoku-in NJ J ED. "It symbolizes cutting something apart, as a sign to terrify demons. From the fst the index fnger is raised straight up..." What I have rendered visakha is given in the Chinese as wei-sha-hua E }" S. This is an epithet for the Hindu god Kgrttikeya, whose mount is the peacock. His equivalent in Tantric Buddhism is the deity Mahi-maydri, whose special function is to exterminate venomous snakes: he or she also rides the peacock. Mikkya daijiten cites an earlier description of Jfngult from a work translated in the eighth century by Amoghavajra in which the corresponding attribute held is apeacock's tail feather. This isparaphrased in the account given in Bukkyd daijiten, pp. 2578- 117</page><page sequence="44">79; which also illustrates one form of the goddess from a late Heian iconographical drawing, standing (though notprancing, as in our roll). Descriptions close to the one translated by Fa-hsien are given by Bhattacharya, Iconography, p. 79, and by Antoinette Gordon, The Iconography of Tibetan Buddhism,p.71; both of these mention a blue lotus rather than thefeather. The dragon-king Avalokite'vara is attended by four Ndgini, the two upper ones with seven snakes heads each, and the two lower with three only. The one to the proper upper left of the king holds a spray of flowers in her right hand and a snake in her left. Her companion, somewhat lower in the picture, holds a snake in her left hand and makes a mudrd with her right. Of those to the proper right of the king, the upper one makes a mudrdwith her left hand, while her right is hidden; the lower one holds a sword in her right hand and a snake in her left. Below in the center is a three-legged man lying on his back, while to each side are three kneel- ing figures. I 13 The eighty-fourth group: The inscription at the upper right reads: Nan-wu Ju-i-lun P'u-sa, i. e. Adoration to the Bodhis- attva Cintdmani-cakra. The divinity sits in mahdrajaliladsana on a white lotus edged with crimson, with designs in maroon at the bases of the petals. He has three haloes. The outer one is white, edged with gold; the round one behind the body is pale blue, edged with flames, which are yellow ending in red points; the one behind the head, which is round or oval, is of a slightly darker blue and is edged with the same kind of flames. On its circumference, above the tip of the divinity's crown, is a tripartite jewel. The crown is very elaborate and bears a seated image of the dhydni Buddha Amitdbha. Cintamdni-cakra is gold in color and has the urna. He is adorned with all the royal jewelry--earrings, necklace, girdle, kneelets, armlets, bracelets, anklets, etc. The attributes and mudris are: Proper left Proper right i.

On his left shoulder is a third scarf, orange in color, with red folds. From his crown on each side flow pink scarves with red folds. Red ribbons (?) hang from the crown in loops over his forehead. His eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth, as well as the hand resting against the cheek, seem to have been retouched. Above is a canopy ofpao-hsiang hua (a kind of conventionalized lotus), pink, maroon, blue and other colors, and two pale maroon lotuses, with hanging gold garlands.rsI xs1 For further information about this deity, including the philosophy back of his worship, symbolism of the six arms, etc., see the article by the present writer entitled "A study in Buddhist iconography", Ostasiatische Zeitschrift, n.f. VIII/I-2, 1932, and XI/5, I935. II8</page><page sequence="45">In the foreground, are four female attendants. Farthest to the spectator's right is a lady kneel- ing on her left knee, her head turned to the left, with her two index fingers raised touching each other. Red flames issue from their point of juncture. She is dressed in pale pinks and maroons. The lotus on which she kneels is yellow and her halo is pale green. Next to her, farther to the spec- tator's left and closer to him, is another lady kneeling on her right knee on a pink lotus edged with red. Her dress is a pale green-yellow. She holds a conch shell in both hands. To the spectator's left, in a position corresponding to that of the lady just described, is another, seated (?) on a pink lotus edged with maroon. Her head is turned away from the center and she holds a tray of pink lotus flowers in both hands. She is dressed in pale pink and has a pale green halo. The painting is worn and stained where the lower part of her body should be. Behind her, farther to the left, is a position corresponding to that of the first of the four, is another attendant, seated facing toward the center, with both (?) knees raised. The lotus under her is pink, and she wears a pink skirt with a white ruffled border and a pale yellowish green over- garment. Her head, is seen in profile with a somewhat Jewish nose in evidence. Each of the four has the rrna. I have not yet identified these ladies. 114 The eighty-fifth group: The inscription at the upper right reads: Ho-li-ti mu chung, i.e. Mother Hdriti and her en- tourage. Hdriti is seated in lalitdisana on a large dais, her right leg pendent resting on a lotus; an empty lotus awaits her left foot. She holds a pomegranate in her right hand, and her youngest son, Pifi- gala, in her left. He is chubby and round-faced and leans out over his mother's restraining arm, a round fan in his left hand. She wears flowing robes and a long scarf which whirls into one large circle behind her head and two smaller ones to right and left, forming a kind of halo. Her sleeves have ruffles at the elbow, from which long undersleeves extend to the wrists. She wears a head- dress of considerable elaborateness, the highest part of which is at the back, and earrings, neck- lace, anklets, girdle, etc. Her feet are bare. One boy, wearing a small apron tied behind above his little bare buttocks, climbs up over Hariti's right foot, and another boy, more fully dressed, is kneeling on his left knee, his right knee bent, and leaning forward either to help his brother or bent on mischief, thinking to push his mother's foot and upset the little climber. Above hangs a canopy with pendent streamers and garlands, and behind Hdriti and the two attendants to right and left of her is a four-fold screen which stands very high, depicting waves. The background above the screen was once blue, of which a suggestion remains at the very top of the picture. To Hiriti's proper left stands an attendant, holding a small boy in her arms; while to the right, a somewhat larger attendant holds what seems to be a string, on the upper end of which is a large fan with a painting of birds and flowers on it. The string, held in her right hand, turns obli- quely in Hgriti's direction and is held also, farther down, by her left hand, which is covered by her is2 Her youngest among 500oo and her favorite, whom the Buddha stole for a time and hid in his begging-bowl in order to convert Hdriti from her evil ways of child eating. He is said to have given her the pomegranate [to eat instead] because when broken open its blood-red fruit somewhat resembles human flesh. For an excellent study of Hdriti see N. Peri in the Bull. de l'colefranq., d'Extrime Orient, XVII, I9 17. II9</page><page sequence="46">long sleeve. In front of the attendant holding the child, is a wet-nurse, seated on the floor, giving her breast to another boy. Opposite her and in front of the attendant with the fan, stands a nurse holding a child in her arms and kissing him. Slightly to the spectator's right of the centre, in the immediate foreground, is a fifth nurse, kneeling on her right knee, holding out a towel in both hands toward a little boy in overalls, who has both hands over his head. Evidently he is not over- desirous of having his face washed. Behind the boy in overalls, to the spectator's left, a boy with an extremely large head is reclining on a pillow, fast asleep. On the floor in front of him is a hobby horse. On the other side, behind the kneeling attendant and in front of the wet-nurse, is a little boy hugging a dog. The whole scene is a delightful bit of genre painting, introduced quite naturally as a part of the composition and as a part of the iconography. There is very little coloring in this picture, which is perhaps unfinished. The hair and flesh are painted in, and the jewelry is also colored, though but faintly, except for a part of Hiriti's headdress. The waves on the screen are shaded with ink, and the sky above is a pale yellow. The panelling of the screen was once blue. It is possible that certain colors have faded or been washed away. S15 The eighty-sixth group: The inscription at the upper right reads: Ta sheng san chieh chuan-lun wang chung, i.e. The Great Holy King who turns the Wheel in the Three Worlds, with his retinue. A Cakravartin, or Universal Monarch, sits in lalitisana, with left leg pendent, on two fierce demons on a rock. He is cross-eyed and has a fierce expression. He is of a Central Asian type, has almond eyes, a pointed chin, a wide face, pointed ears, and is very hairy. He wears full armor, but has a headdress instead of a helmet. He holds a halberd just below the blade in his left hand, while the handle rests on the rock; his right hand, open palm outward, is behind the halberd. Behind him, one extending her head to the right and the other extending hers to the left, are two female attendants. To the proper left, is a man with a reddish beard, holding a blank book and two writing brushes. Opposite him is a hairy demon, light brown in color, with a large, red, open mouth; his right hand is upraised and his left is holding a tall banner. He is naked except for a tiger skin and a scarf around his loins. In front of him, a bearded king (?) is seated on a chair, wearing a hat. On his robe, is theya symbol. His hands are crossed in front, thumb touching thumb. To his left, is a female attendant. Opposite him, bowing to the waist before him, is an armored warrior, bearded, holding a bow in his left hand, and pointing backward with his right. At the top, are remnants of a blue background. The Cakravartin has a pale blue halo. All the people in the picture are painted various shades of flesh color. The demon to the spectator's left on whom the Cakra- vartin is sitting has red hair. The rock is shaded with ink. The hair is painted black in every case except as noted above. The two demons are grey. The armor is slightly colored and the halberd and banner have gold staves; the rest is in outline. I I6 The eighty-seventh group": A fierce, three-headed, two-legged, eight-armed divinity, whose flesh is gold in color, stands on a pink and white lotus. He has red hair and his main head is furnished with a red beard. Each I20</page><page sequence="47">face has tusks and three eyes; and on each head are two skulls, a gold headdress, and a snake. The divinity wears snake anklets, bracelets, and armlets, while other snakes are draped over his left shoulder. He also has one snake earring. He wears in addition a gold necklace, armlets, and girdle. He has on a pink skirt, showing red at the folds, a tiger-skin, and a white scarf. Above the waist he is naked except for jewelry and snakes. The attributes he holds are: Proper left Proper right I. Lasso i. Three-pronged vajra, held aloft 2. Trident 2. Naked sword 3. Sword capped by three-pronged vajra 3. Sword (?) capped by flaming jewel 4. Bow 4. Quiver full of arrows The three heads and eight arms with their attributes make this probably a form taken by Trailokyavyjaya Vidydraja (GosanZe Myjj). He is usually shown trampling on the small, prostrate bodies of Siva and Parvati, but also may be shown as if running. Behind the divinity are pale yellow flames edged with black and red. In their midst is a band of yellow, blue, and maroon, forming an aureole. In the foreground, to the spectator's right, is a bird with human arms, kneeling, his head raised. In front of him is an openwork basket containing three human heads. There is no inscription. With this deity the top border motif changes to a new form of double-ended, multi-pronged vajra; the shank becomes even more artificial in appearance, and rather than anything graspable, looks like a flat oval panel, with a medallion inside. This motif continues to the end of the scroll, ending with the two first colophons by Miao-kuang and Sung Lien. On the other hand the bottom border decoration remains as before. S17 The eighty-eighth group. Vaisravana, the Guardian of the North, god of wealth and of war, stands on clouds, dressed in elaborate armor. On his head, however, instead of a helmet he wears a fancy crown, seemingly more suitable for a queen, with a phoenix rising from the center; and in the ear visible to the spectator is a large gold ring-earring. He wears red sandals on his [otherwise] bare feet, and a long white scarf is draped over both arms and flutters to right and left. He holds a stzpa on a dark grey lotus on the palm of his right hand, and a tall banner in his left, at the top of which is a two-edged spear. The banner has many streamers, yellow, blue, red, green, and maroon. In lieu of a halo, flames encircle his head. He has two much smaller attendants standing behind him, a Garu&lt;da to his left and a boy on his right. The former is slightly the taller [of the two] but does not reach Vaidravavana's waist. He has a bird's head and wings, but human legs and feet, and is very hairy. The clouds on which all three are standing end in a long, tapering streamer sweeping around from the spectator's right of the flame-halo, and ending in a point [better, coming from a point] at the top left of the panel. I2I</page><page sequence="48">The feature of a bird on the headgear of Vaisrava.a is discussed by Matsumoto Bunsaburj , S2 -- Za,, in his Bukky6-shi zakk6 a 4k -P *t, Osaka, 944, pp. 279- 8, in connection with the iconography of the specialform of the deity known in Japan as Tobatsu Bishamon. He suggests that the idea may have originated with the crowns worn by Sasanian monarchs, andpoints to the frequent appearance of bird headgear among the mailed tomb guardians in T'ang glazed earthenware. Among Buddhist references the locus classicus for the West is the story retold in the Japanese Kakuzensh6 W WTl- , of an old hall in Khotan, containing buried treasure and an installed Vaisravana with a "phoenix" crown; when a robber broke in, the bird flapped its wings and cried out, frightening him away. This tale was told earlier about Kapila (in modern Afgha- nistan), in the biography of Hsiian-tsang by his disciple Hui-li; see S. Beal, Life of Hiuen- tsang, p. ff. i 18 The eighty-ninth group: A fierce (ugra) divinity, whose flesh is gold in color, with nine heads, eighteen arms, and three legs, stands on ayantra on a red lotus which rests on a rock. In the [front] corner of theyantra is a limp human female figure, around which twines a red snake. The hair of all nine heads, red and gold in color, is standing on end. The central head in each tier of three is provided with tusks, and all nine faces have three eyes apiece. Skulls and snakes adorn all the nine heads, and the divinity wears a necklace of severed human heads ands sakes. His bracelets, armlets, kneelets, and anklets are all of snakes. He wears a tiger's skin from the loins to the knees, and a pink scarf is tied about his loins, leaving his navel bare; above, he is naked, except for a red scarf worn around his body under the arms. The hands hold: Proper right Proper left I. Skull (also held by left hand no. 2) i. Conch (also held by right hand no. 2) 2. Conch (also held by left hand no. i) 2.

Fzd Mydo in Japan]. Large feathers with considerable space between are visible emerging from behind the divinity's body, and sticking out beyond his arms. Between the middle and outer legs feathers similar to those in a bird's tail hang down. It 15ss A Chinese T'ang dynasty pottery drum of the same shape is in the Shas6in, southern section, no.

A gilded bronze image of this deity some 17 inches high, ascribed to the T'ang period, was included in the Asia House exhibition of Tibetan art in 9 69. Dr. Pratapaditya Pal, the show's organizer, called it a Dharmapila, guardian of the Law. Another three-legged statuette is pub- lished in Antoinette Gordon's book on Tibetan Lamaist iconography, and a third Dharmapila by Alice Getty.Is4 The latter calls it a Tantric form of Kuvera, on thegrounds that three legs are an attribute of that god in Hinduist mythology. The feature is one of the deformities thatjustify the name Ku-vera, vile body.,ss Since no better iconographic clue to the long roll's monstrousfigure seems to be available, he may be thought of as a Tantric version of Vailravatna, shown conventionally as Lokapala of the north in theprecedingframe. He has two small demon attendants, one to the right and the other to the left, each standing on a skull. Each has a skull on his head, and a tiger's skin and scarf round his waist, and another scarf tied around the neck. The demon to the divinity's proper left holds a peculiar dark object in his hands which is probably the head of some animal, as it seems to have an eye, perhaps an owl. The demon opposite holds a three-pointed vajra in a horizontal position at the level of his shoul- ders. The former has an open mouth with bared teeth; the latter's mouth is closed and he bites his chin with his upper teeth. This group marks the end of my notes, the point near the end at which I had to stop when I left Peking in March, 1932. The descriptions and comments thatfollow are by A CS. S19 The ninetieth group: A standing, fierce deity with a single head andfour arms, perhaps identifiable as the Lokapala of the South, Vir#dhaka. He has the irnd and two up-turning fangs; a skull isprominent at the front of his headdress. Snakes writhe through his hair and serve as his earrings, bracelets, and anklets; while the superstructure of his crown, and his necklace, are shown asjewelled. He wears a brief tiger's-skin dhoti with a cloth girdle and a long, billowing scarf;four severed human heads are tied to his waist in front. His two outer arms hold a trident wound about by a snake and impal- ing a small human head through the mouth (on his right), and a small damaru-type drum (on his left). The inner right hand holds what may be a noosepartly hidden, and the inner left an unidenti- Jiable object. There is a small, wind-blown flame halo. The two consorts wear Sung-style robes with very long, full sleeves. They and the god stand on a cloud shown as emerging from a far-off point at top right. Color notes from here on, being based only on color slides taken in zy 6:, have been minimized. 154 [A CS]: P. Pal, The Art of Tibet, Asia Society, New York, 1969, no. 64. A.

He has six arms rather than four, and the extra two hold on his right an upraised sword, and on his left a dangling rosary. The others hold trident, noose, hour-glass- shaped drum and what I have called an unidentifiable object, just as in the painting. Skulls are prominent in his waist-band, necklace, and headdress; he has the same sort of long scarf swirling around his body, and the same small, flame-edged halo. The similarity between these two guardians is reinforced by afigure of a standing Bodhisattva, carved in the same fashion within a shallow niche on the cliffside, in the adjoining shrine no. j. Although the published photograph is mediocre, and the figure is somewhat damaged, the icono- graphy seems to be that of the A-ts'o-yeh Kuan-yin, what Chapin called "the luck of Yiinnan". A damaged votive inscription nearby begins with a reference to the Ta Li kingdom, and contains the name Kuan-yin. Possibly this work, like the surviving Yiinnanese bronze images and the long roll itself, testifies to a twelfth century revival of the cult that claimed a divine originfor the Nan Chao regime. i z20 The ninety-first group: A fierce deity identifiable as Yamantaka, shown riding on a gallopping water-buffalo, surrounded by a wind-blown flame aureole.

On his right side the god is framed by a group of five demon-warrior attendants and an erect goat. On his left stand three ladies in hybrid attire; the first, the only one clearly visible, has the girdled skirt,jewellry, and coiffure of a minor Bodhisattva, with the closelyfitted bodicefrequently given goddesses in the Far East to lessen their traditional semi-nudity.

Wlith a small, single-serpent-hooded maid and a boy-like figure with shaven head on which she has placed her hand, she stands on a double coiled mat, resting on a rock with sharply indented contours, rising out of water. Behind her, emerging from the water, are four Ngin attendants, dressed as she is but more simply, each with a single serpent's-head hood. From her left to her right they hold: a sword; a bag (of money ?) ; and ajar containing luminousjewels (?). On her left and right, respectively, are cock- and snake-headedfigures, with human hands and dress and scaly lower bodies emergingfrom the water. The cock figure holds a fruit (? left) and halberd (right) ; the snake figure a basket with fruits (? both hands). A common body of water all around, and intertwining coils of supernatural vapor, link this female deity with the male in the nextframe. The Ndgini's skin is dark golden. Strong white accents in the snake hoods, and the small boy. The cock's head is red, and the robed snake is silvery grey.

The Chi ku Tien shuo in its erraticfashion contributes a detail of great interest here.,s7 Summarizing the reign of the third Nan Chao king, "a devoted believer in Buddhism", who rebuilt the old town on Lake Tien to serve as his capital, the record says that he "had fashioned a holy image of the celestial deity who is lord of this great and numinous land, Mahd Kila by name" Z l k i 1 C + Q a aB  h M 5 .? This was set up in a shrine to guard the new city; a later reference, from the ninth reign, speaks of it as being on the north side (the usual postfor defensive magic against malign influences). "An inspired craftsman, Lo T'u-tao-t'ai, camefrom Szechwan to mould the figure. When it was completed a certain P'u-t'i-pa-p'o [from the Pali Bodhipabbha, or Sanskrit Bodhiprabhd?] from India used secret incantations to write down in cinnabar its divine position [in the mandala?] in bija form, consecrating the shrine within the Since there is clearly an intimate relationship between the female and male icons of frames z2 and 124, it seems likely that the Nigini and her attendants stand for Lake Tien, perhaps accom- panied by the streams that feed it. The two frames together would thus refer to the Nan Chao Eastern Capital. We have met the cock- and snake-headed beings before in frames zi and 14, in pictures that were also set against a body of water, celebrating two Nigardajas and their courts. In the first of these, which I took to be a first reference to the powers inhabiting Lake Tien, they stand in the foreground water. In the second, which I assigned to the rival lake and capital in the Ta-li region, they emergefrom water in the middle distance. Thefront corners are filled by an ox-headed being on the viewer's right and a tiger-headed being on his left, both sitting on rocks. I referred briefly to thefact that these "are perhaps local water deities who were worshipped in shrines on the north and east shores qf the Ta-li lake." My sourcefor this suggestion is the nineteenth century provincial gazetteer, Yiin-nan t'ung chih, xiv, p. ;, a, taken from a Ming description by a certain Li Yian-yang E in his Hsi-erh-hai chih -i p j h . The account localizes a widely found legend by telling that the region was ransomedfrom an evil dragon by Avalokites'vara in human form. The same type of dragon still lurks below the surface in grottoes along the mountainous east shore, andfrom time to time stirs up dangerous squalls. Once a holy priest went to that shore and set up a temple to quell them. Shrines to water gods were also established on the banks: "they are formed with an ox head and human body, or with a tiger's head and a cock's beak." I had hoped when I discussed frames z3 and z4 to be able to explain at this point the two other attendant figures with cock and snake heads, but still cannot do so with complete confdence. I originally assumed that they were cyclical fgures standing for twopoints in time and on the compass: the cock with his spearperhaps standing for yu a and some sort of natural defense in the west; and the snake with his jewels representing ssu C and the northeast as a wealth-producing center. A manifest shortcoming in this case is the fact that these directions correspond to nothing that I have found in the records (such as they are) ; and that it would be a remarkable coincidence if they suited the topogradphy of both mountain-ringed lakes. For this reason I now prefer to think of the two as s157 Yiin-nan pei cheng chih, v, pp. 53, a; 56, b. 127</page><page sequence="54">references to two great naturalpowers worshipped in Yiinnan before the supremacy of Buddhism was established. We knowfrom the extraordinary bronze sculptures found in royalgraves over- looking Lake Tien, datingfrom the late second century B. C., that a snake and pillar cult was important at least in the royal territory.158 The legend oJ thefirstprodigy that announced the shift of supernaturalfavor toward the Mengfamily, in the seventh century A. D., hinged on the descent of a golden birdfrom its sacredpillar.1s Helen Chapin tookpains to study the continuation of the bird-column theme in Buddhist Yfnnan; andfound as she thought important verifcation in descrip- tions of the crowningfeatures of two great Nan Chao pagodas, at the two capitals.I6o Each was surmounted by either one orfour large metal birds: "to commemorate the birdprodigy... to fix firmly in the minds of thepeople the divine right to rule oJ'the house of Meng... and when there were four, to indicate that the power of the ruler whose symbol they were extended in alljbour directions. The bird (and pagoda) had the secondary function of controlling the ndga (dragon or dragons [or snakes]) in the Lake of Ta-li, thus corresponding to the Indian Garuda..." If this is so, the fact that the long rolls' snake and cock figures are shown in human dress as part of a royal court must be a way of emphasiting their new tameness and docility. The Chi ku Tien shuo adds one further, tantalizing sentence about the building and fur- nishing of the East Capital at Tien (calledfrom its shape the Tortoise City): "Furthermore they moulded two deities, one to guard the Tortoise City's neck, the other its southern side; in numinous virtue they were as one."i6I Can these accountfor two of the otherwise unassigned terrific deities we have metfromframe zz6 on (including one in frame 18 who as a Tantric variant of Kuvera should represent the north) ? And whether or not this is so, should there not be others who embodied the unassailable power of Ta-li and its lake and river, now in Tantric terms rather than the milder ones used at the onset of the scroll? We have seen an earlier Kilapresiding overframe I2. He stands on a Niga emergingfrom a tumult of water, more like a river than the calm lake surface offrames 123 and 124. He holds what might be taken as a transfigured conch shell, perhaps as a reference to the "gold conch" that was one of the supernaturalfeatures of the Hsi-erh River. Thefollowingflgure inframe r22, the more static Yaksa-deity of Great Peace, is both land-based, and stands heavy-footed on a constel- lation one of whose names is T'u-ti Hsiu ? it gT, the [Lunar] Mansion of the Soil, or Land. T'u-ti Shen is a common name for the tutelary god of any region. A striking alternative name for the same constellation is T'ien Tu , : , the Celestial Metropolis. In Buddhist astrology it is associated with wealth. It falls as a sub-group, within the very long southern constellation Hydra, called in China the Quail, Ch'un g. 62 iss Yiinnan Provincial Museum, Yiin-nan Chin-ning Shan ku mu ch'iin fa-chi'eh pao-kao q - - 3 l l -; V ht Ia S, Peking, 1959, pls. 52-55, pp. 75, 76.

In terms of the celestial diagram redrawn for Needham's section on Astronomy (fig.Rl), 163 the "heart" and the "head" are adjacent sectors in the south and southwest. Perhaps the methods of calculating were slightly different, or the region defined in the Chin shu was not close to Ta-li. Orperhaps the Nan Chao, or their suc- cessors, preferred to make the sub-group Hsing standfor their city because of its splendid alternative name, the Metropolis of Heaven. In either case it seems to me likely that the Yaksa-deity of Great Peace was the tutelary god of Ta-li, corresponding to Kila at Tien. If the figure next to him, the "Kila of the Golden Alms- bowl", embodies the dynasty's control over its western lake, its triumphant trampling on a dragon squirming in the water may well derivefrom a remarkable legend told in the Nan Chao yeh shih under the reign of the ninth Nan Chao king (h6-24). I translate from the shorter Chinese text:,64 "There was in the Erh-shui a monster serpent named Po-chieh S ). It stirred up floods that invaded the capital, until the king declared that whoever could overcome it would be granted the entire state treasury and a perpetual exemption for his descendants from taxation and labor duties. Now a certain Tuan Ch'ih-ch'eng J A;, vowing to kill the serpent, strapped on a dagger andplunged into the water. The serpent swallowed him; [as a result both] died, and the watery calamities came to an end. The king established a temple to stand guard over the spot, [and buried beneath] itspagoda the cremated bones and hide of the serpent, calling it the Numinous Pagoda, Ling t'a. Everyyear there was a stirring of the serpent (?); and when the wind rose and blew away theplaster on thepagoda, people would say that Ch'ih-ch'eng waspretending to be off- guard. At the present Shrine of the Dragon King there is a stele that reads: 'Ch'ih-ch'eng, Dragon King of the Erh River, made a god as a rewardfor hisfeat.'" (The version rendered in French by Sainson, pp. 59- 6o, is slightly different.) I 25 The ninety-sixth group: A standing deity, stiffly erect, with six heads, twelve arms, and six legs; on a lotus base supported by a rock risingfrom water. The label at upper left effaced; the insistence on six or its multiple suggests Yamantaka, whom we have already seen riding on his water-bufalo inframe z2o. If they are the same, this is a semi-benign version; the large, flame-edged aureole is like a Bodhisattva's (e.g. frame y7) or M rici's (frame zo7). Theprincipal face is gentle (though the three in the flaming coiffure are very fierce). The waist-cloth is a tiger-skin, but there are no snakes or skulls, and thejewellry is what Chapin called "royal". The attributes held are and mudrds made from top down: x63 NCYS, Fr. I I, Ch.

The largest figure, at the center surrounded by a plain round aureole, is four-armed, in the runningpose of an Indian god in figt. Hisface is hairless and halffierce, with small tusks. He wears a high crown, heavy "royal"jewelry; his voluminous dhoti, trailing behind, seems to be decorated with cloudpatterns, and he has a girdle of leaves; a billowingscarf and headdress ribbons heighten the sense of swiftness and buoyancy. His two right hands hold (I) a five-pronged vajra, and (2) a sword. Those on the his left hold (I) a mace with a head made of crossed vajras, and (2) makes a mudrd with raised index fnger on the axis of the body. Above him on right and left are two smaller, but six-armed, otherwise very similar beings, shown flying outward. Each is armed with a bow, and has a battle-axe in place of the mace. One makes an additional outward-pointing mudrd, the other's extra hand holds an arrow fxed to the bow. Below on axis is a regal deity seated on a reclining, profile elephant in the lalitasana pose. He is dressed and bejewelled very much like the flyers above, though the dhoti seems longer and unpat- terned. Of two right hands (I) holds an upright arrow, while (2) makes a mudrd; on the left (I) holds a staff (?) and (2) a vajra on the axis of the body. Two flanking outward-flyers introduce further variations; the one on the viewer's left brandishes a spear, while the other sights along a strung arrow. The Maruts' bodies are golden, their scarves and dhotis reddish brown; the round aureole is bluish. There seems no question that the figure at bottom center is Indra, the traditional king of the gods, properly equzipped with his thunderbolt and throned on his proper steed, the white elephant Airivata. The fying youths recall the figures often mentioned in Vedic literature as his sons or myrmidons in battle, the Maruts (symbolizing the storm-winds). Clearly the entire group has been modernized by Tantric features. I shall say more about it in connection with the next frame. 130</page><page sequence="57">127 The ninety-eighth group: Here there is a label at the adjoining top corner offrame 128, which reads: Fu-fan cb'u-ku Lu-chia Cbin-kang, i. e. Lokavajra who downs troubles and dispels removes suffering. I have found nothing corresponding in either of the large Japanese Buddhist encyclopedic dictionaries. To judge by its contents theframe celebrates one of the ancient Vedic components of Siva, i.e. Rudra as Lord of the Animal World. The central figure, in anotherplain round aureole thefull width of theframe, is a ferce seated deity, eight-headed and six-armed. His three large hairlessfaces scowl; the remainingfive are tiny impassive Buddha heads strung across his coiffure. He wears heavy, metallic-looking jewelry, with four (or moreprobablyfive) more small Buddha heads ingold across his collarbone, and a garland of skulls descending diagonally across his chest. As a kind of uppergarment he has an animalpelt tied around his neck, and a tiger's-skin waistcloth ; a long scarf andgirdle ends flutter outward. He sits ongrass or a long-hairedpelt, with small human headsprotrudingfrom under his crossed legs. The attributes held are: Proper left Proper rght I. Battle-axe r. Trident with impaled head 2. Hourglass-shaped drum 2. Fruit? 3. Ghanta bell 3. Three- or fve-pronged vajra balanced on an object Below him on axis is a youthful deity with normal body parts, sitting in lalitdsana on a mat stretched over a lotus base with richly curlingpetals. Hisface is hairless and half-fierce, with small tusks; he wears "royal"jewelry, an animal skin tied across the torso, a dhoti and a barely visible tiger's -skin waistcloth. His headdress comprises three small skulls, that of a man (or monkey?) at thefront, with a bird's on his right and an animal's on his left (?). He holds a sword (left) and sword (right). His double aureole includes a somewhat oval halo around the head, and a wider halo around the body: a traditional Chineseformula. Above and below are eight creatures with bird or animal heads and human bodies and dress. Several are armed or make threatening mudrds, and hold small animals which they presumably are eating. One, with a hare's head, holds a sword and a tiny, dangling, naked, human figure. One with a bear's head is biting into a similar human victim, held in an are by both hands. Opposite is one with a lion's head and luxuriantly curly hair, making a two-hand mudr8 with a naked mi- niature human drooping from his mouth. The gods' bodies are golden. The main aureole is white, the mandorla below bluish. The fames are edged with black. I take this composition to be based on the old Vedic theme of thefearsome Rudra, lording it over the creatures of the wilds. Again the rendering has been modernized by Tantricfeatures, and brought into the Buddhist sphere by the use of Buddha heads and a quasi-Buddhist name. Fortuna- tely a textual link isprovided by the eight heads, an extremely rare number. Eight heads and six arms characterized a nameless deity whom the Japanese knew as Kyjin or Samba Kojin - 2  , 131</page><page sequence="58">the wild or savage god of the Three Treasures.165 The doctors oJ the Far Eastern Church attempted to link this being with better known Tantric deities orgroups, with Vinayak , with the earthquake god Kampa, with the horrific Mothers or Ddkini, in all cases without success. Obviously the epithet that the Japanese called k, wild or savage, fts Rudra to perfection. Mikkyo daijiten provides a dim illustration of a seated Kojin who is roughly similar, though with a dark skin color and different attributes. The smaller, more human godling below may be a benign, irregular manifestation of Siva, or his handsome son Kumdra/Skanda/Kadrttikeya, the Hinduist god of war. A type of epithet fairly like thatgiven in the label is recorded in several sfxtra translations.for the eighteenth of the Twenty Gods who frame the centralsquare of the KongEkai Mandara.166 The key phrase is T'iao-fu a M , to subjugate: the deity is called the Subjugating Vajra in variant ways. An alternative name is Sword-bearing Vindyakd Deity, or Vindyakd the Subjugator, Vindyaka being an epithet for Siva's younger son, Ga2neSa. Since the latter was almost always shown with an elephant's head and without marked ferocity, it can hardly be he who fills the central aureole. More likely the attempt to modernize the crudeness of the Rudra concept, to create a new Lord of Beasts at the height of the Tantric era, entailed an inescapable overlapping with other outgrowths of the Siva cult. One may well wonder why these two extraordinary compositions were added at the end of the long roll. It seems to me likely that the Indra-and-Maruts theme was chosen because it signified a mastery over the realm of air. If so it formed a third member to thepanels showing the Yonnanese regime's rule over water and earth, in the vicinity of the two capitals. To judge by the now irregular order of the motifs that decorate the bottom borders of theframes, it may originally have followed no. v24, the standing Mahi Kila, in which case the alternation of clouds and fowers would be maintained. The Rudra panel was perhaps planned as a pair with the following frame 28, to show the might of Siva in two different aspects and realms. If so--and if it was originally preceded by the present frame m2t, as the bottom border motifs suggest-there may have been aprudent intention to confne the might of the great Destroyer and Enemy to the very end of the roll; and to pen him in there by a special guard, the Vidydrdaa Yamantaka. From another standpoint the choice of compositionsfeaturing the Maruts and Rudra is so unprecedented for mediaeval Buddhist art everywhere, representing as it did a return to the age- old Vedic tradition, that one is tempted to imagine that the artist of the scroll or the Hou Li king who may have decided its iconographical sequence, had come under the infuence of Indian Brahmans (who may have wandered to Y#nnan from Burma, to seek employment at the royal court as soothsayers or magicians). I r8 The ninsety-ninth group: A group centering on a dark-skinned deity riding aJrontal white bull; identifired by the label at upper left as Shuo-hu Mo-hsi-shou-lo chung, i.e. the Guardian Mahesvrara and attendants. The god's four faces are half-fierce, or scowl; his curly hair is piled up in the fashion of a 165 Mikkyj daijiten, p. 5 40, c. i66 Takata, Akiyama, and Yanagisawa, Takao mandara, p.41 and table 6. 13-</page><page sequence="59">crown, and radiates an aura of light rather than a formal halo. The garments andjewelry are those of a king, lacking skulls, snakes, pelts, etc. He rides in the lalitdsana pose. Of his four hands the outer two hold the disks of the sun (on his left; containing a bird) and moon (on his right, containing the lunar tree, hare, and mortar). The inner twojoin in holding a cock-like bird with a long tail before his breast. The bull is controlled by a nose-band and embellished by a neck-girdle of small bells. The two attendants on either side infront are booted ruffians in T'ang costume. Behind on the god's right is a minister-like figure in Chinese robes and cap, holding a bag of money (?), and another human attendant visible only as a fierce, moustachioedface behind him; on the other side is a three-eyed demon in armor, holding a trident. The group is shown standing on a rock with water infront and behind, and a supernatural cloud arching overhead. Maheivara's skin is a deep gold; his scarves are red, yellow, and white. The bull is white. The iconographicalfeatures of this "Mahehlara" are a puzling combination. The white bull is manifestly Siva's Nandi, but the god has four heads instead of being aproper Trimirti. Siva's earliest recognizable rendition in China, datable around A. D. 47o at the entrance to Cave VIII at Yiin-kang, gives him a bull vehicle and the sun and moon disks to hold in two of his hands.167 But the cock that he clutches here should belong to his warrior son, Kdrttikeya. Four heads and four arms characterize a familiar aspect of Brahmj. In Tantric Buddhist usage they may be assigned to three of the eight Vidydra;jas, Acalanatha, Kundali, and Aparadjita. The privilege of holding the sun and moon disks wasgiven in earlier Mahayina art to the giant Asura; in the long roll it is given elsewhere to the Thousand-armed Avalokitelvara (frames R3, 1o2), and occasion- ally to other, unnamed Bodhisattvas (frames i ,zo/). Perhaps the court iconographers of med- iaeval Yiinnan composed a new, syncretic iva for local use, as theygave him attendants of Chinese type. 29 The one-hundredth subject: A simulated banner in an architecturalframe, containing a Sanskrit text written in a North Indian hand, with individual flourishes and many errors. The Chinese title given above is To Hsin Ching Ch'uang, i.e. Banner with the [Prajidpirami] ta H1rdaya Sftra, the "Heart of the Prajgipiramita".'68 The abbreviation used, which reduces one of the most potent words in Mahayna belief to its final syllable, would doubtless have seemed to an ardent Indian Buddhist frivolous or worse. The frame has an elaborate floral cresting, curled in Guptan fashion and centered on a trunked kirtimukha head. On top is a miniature sterpa with a globular Sung-style roof, surmounted by a luminous pearl. The sides are enclosed by Indian-type colonnets, and the whole is represented as standing on a double-lotus dais. 167 See Mizuno, Seiichi, and Nagahiro, Yun-kang, The Buddhist Cave-temples of the Fifth Century A.D. in North China, V, Ky6to 195 1, pls. - I-I5 and p. 97 of the English text.

The top member here is an enlarged, two-tier Sung style stapa, and the base is the familiar Chinese hour-glass-shaped lotus throne. The heart-shaped body of the upper stapa tier is shown as open, with a miniature Buddha seated inside. The Chinese label reads: Huo Kuo Ching Ch'uang, i.e. Banner with a Realm-protectiqg Sdtra. The text copied, in the same hand as the preceding, is a short dh1rani.69 The first half, as translated by Professor Alexander Wayman of Columbia University, runs: "Homage to the Three Jewels.

The remainder is a transcribed spell, written with many corruptions. 3 1-34 The one-hundred-and-second subject: The label at upper right reads: Shih-liu Ta Kuo Wang Chung, i. e. the Kings of the Sixteen Great Realms and their Attendants. The concept of sixteen major kingdoms first appears in late Hinayana scriptures, applied wholly within India; and is sporadically modernized thereafter to suit the expansion of the Church. The composition used is obviously indebted to representations of the monarchs who comefrom all quarters to attend the debate between Vimalakirti and Manjus'ri, frequently shown in the wall paintings of Tun-huang. o There, however, within the boundaries of China proper the Chinese emperor is set with his courtiers on one side and the outlanders are massed on the other. Here they are all'breigners, with the entire length of the roll between them and the Yfnnanese ruler at its head. The Chinese emperor, with two acolytes to hold his heavy sleeves, shares the first frame with a figure who looks like a senile Bodhisattva, and sopresumably standsfor India. The characterization of the rest isperfunctory, in comparison with even routine versions at Tun-huang. It is curious that no figure is dark-skinned, in view of the relations that existed between Yinnan and Southeast Asian countries. Various shades of red predominate in the garments. The Chinese emperor's over-robe is a purplish black. The white-haired, square-headed man in frame Ip3 is dressed in greenish gold, and the figure at the end in Indian princely dress has pale, silvery blue scarves. The group was obviously not drawn by Chang Sheng-wen, and is much closer to the hand or hands seen in the series of Yiinnanese patriarchs, frames yx-y7. Presumably these local, semi- 169 I have not found any short dharamn with these characters in its title in the volumes on esoteric (Mikky6) texts in XVIII- XXI. 7o Matsumoto, Eiichi, Tonk6-ga, pls. 46-54 and pp. I43-164. 134</page><page sequence="61">secular subjects were relegated to YAnnanese artists, perhaps because of court politics. It is not hard to see, from the difference in quality, why so much was entrusted to the visiting Chinese master. If Chang Sheng-wen is ever identified moreprecisely--and the likelihood is very small-it will doubtless be through a chance encounter with his name in some Sung document. Almost unquestion- ably he came from Shu, i. e.from Szechwan, the traditional source of superior craftsmanship for the Yinnanese kingdoms. We know a good deal about Shupaintersfrom late T'ang until the early eleventh century from the I-chou ming hua lu ? ?i'I g ,:6 , which focuses on that province exclusively, and some additional references in the Northern Sung histories and catalogues. From the early eleventh on, however, only a veryfew new names caught the attention of connoisseurs and critics in the major cultural centers of China. Chang Sheng-wen is likely to have been a member of apaintingfamily, like thosefrequently mentioned in the histories, the Chao, Tu, Ch'ang, Huang, P'u, and Kao. The extraordinary variety of his compositions, iconographical types, and even minor details recalls thepraise given to several Shu specialists in Buddhist and Taoist themes. The long rollmay be taken as a late survivor of the exuberance associated with the end-of-T'ang master Chang Nan-pen J M *, of whom the I-chou ming hua lu says (in i, under "Inspired Class, middle") : "He was invited [by a prefectural mayor] to depict the supernaturalpowers of Heaven and Earth: the Courts of the Sky, Land, and Water; the Five [Cosmic] Emperors; the Lord of Thunder and the Lightning Mother; the divine Immortals of the great Peaks and Waterways; the rulersfrom ancient times on down; and the various shrines in Shu. These took up over 120 hanging rolls, showing a thousand wonders and a myriad rarities: demon deities, dragons and beasts, water and hill sprites pullulated among them. In their time they were considered great masterpieces." The best known Shu painters were carried off to the Sung capital when the local Meng regime capitulated in 9y66, and naturally established their families there where patronage was most generous. We know by chance a very little about one artist of the nextgeneration with the surname Chang who remained in Shu, and throughout apainting career of a half centuryfilled the Ch'eng-tu temples with Buddhist figures and Lo-han. This was a certain Chang Kuang-tsan jj W ),171 a descendant of the early Five Dynasties master Chang Hsfan J 3 and his heir as a specialist in Lo-hanfigures. Hsiian was represented in the Emperor Hui Tsung's collection by two large sets of Lo-han; the Hsian-ho hua p'u, iii, comments that while mostpainters in that field followed the exotic and grotesque figure types invented by Kuan Hsiu, Hsiian "picked the actual look of the everyday world." I-chou ming hua lu, ii, where he appears in the bottom group of the Excellent Class, says that he followed the brush tradition of Wu, i. e. that he drew with a vigorous, modulated line that created a sense of motion. Both of these comments might be made about the Lo-han series in the long roll (which in other respects also is noticeably unlike the formulae of the Sung capital regions that we know from examples inJapan). 171 See Chu Chu-yii k O A and Li Shih-sun E U , T'ang Sung hua-chia-jen ming tZ'u-tien jN 5 . % A, 0 a &gt;, Peking I 95 8, p. 249.

In the Imperial Ch'ing bibliography Ssu k'u ch'uan shu tsung-mu, 142, the first character is given as Mao -, a homophone that I suppose was chosen to avoid a Ch'ing taboo. Much better known than Chang Kuang-tsan was Sun Chih-wei, who was acknowledged as a master of the first rank at the Sung capital, and was well represented in Hui Tsung's collection: see Soper, Experiences, pp. 48, 5 3, 54, and n.447. 135</page><page sequence="62">It would be absurd to use such grounds for a claim that the later twelfth century Chang Sheng- wen was a descendant of Chang Kuang-tsan, and so of Chang Hsiian. I suggest merely that he may well have had behind him that sort of specialized artistic and religious inheritance. 135-36 The framed colophons: The last two frames enclosed by top and bottom borders are those that contain the earliest colophons, on the right Miao-kuang's dated ziio and on the left Sung Lien's from early Ming.

Conclusion [by HC]: This study of the long roll of Buddhist images in the Palace Museum attributed to the artist Chang Sheng-wen and painted between the years I 173 and I 176, during the reign of the Emperor Li Chen of the Hou Li kingdom, situated in what is now Yt*nnan province, is as the title indicates merely a preliminary outline which the writer hopes to use as a basis for further research. None realizes better than she the necessity for further study with adequate materials in the form of reference books, especially those by Japanese scholars, in the presence of the painting itself and other paintings illustrating T'ang Buddhist iconography. In this paper she has done the best she could with the material at hand; and she would welcome any suggestions or corrections. She hopes that the paper may act as a stimulus toward further comparative study of Indian and Chinese Buddhism and Buddhist art. No attempt has been made here toward an artistic or stylistic evaluation of the work, a study which it merits as a good example of Sung painting and as the more important one of two only, known to emanate from Yiinnan. The other is of course the Yamanaka scroll mentioned above. The writer believes that the small frontispiece to a Buddhist sitra in the Freer Gallery is another Sung painting which comes from Y *nnan.17z As to what are the indigenous contributions to the style of our roll, it is hard to say, since we have so little material for comparison. A few stylistic correspondences may, however, be pointed out. The Chinese influence is basic, in technique, in quality of line and composition, in the spirit of the work, and in details both of divinities and of human beings. The landscapes also are Chinese, and the illustrations to the vows of the Buddha Bhaisajyaguru are delightful bits of Chinese painting. Hdriti's family of boys is one to delight a Chinese father's heart; it has a number of parallels in Sung secular painting. There is an example in the Palace Museum, where among a group of boys at play a youngster with a big head like Hiriti's little sleepy lad is riding, ifI remember correctly, on just such a hobby-horse as lies by the sleeping boy's side. Indian influence is seen in the iconography, in the presence of Nigas and Niginis, of the sd- dhaka manifesting the Thousand-petalled Lotus, of the Seven Gems of the Cakravartin, etc. etc.; and in the Indian dress of many divinities, who are naked to the waist except for jewelry: as for example that of the Avalokiteivara who saves from perils. The introduction of the naked man with the ram's head and the naked woman with a cornucopia as attendants on the goddess of good 172 [ACS]: Freer Chinese painting no.26.I, entitled The Buddha Addressing Yamaraja at Kulinagara, 9th-Ioth centuries, Published in Yamanaka, Sadajiro, Tjsx seika (Select relics of the T'ang and Sung dynasties from collections in Europe and America), Osaka, 1929, II, pl. 3" 136</page><page sequence="63">fortune must be ascribed to Indian influence. The face of Sikyamuni, the central Buddha of the large assemblage, betrays Indian affinity. Nepalese influence is exhibited by a number of the faces, notably those of the standing figures of the Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara and of Mdrici. Central Asian affinities show in the almond eyes and pointed ears of Mafijusri and in the bearded face of the warrior king who may be Vira- dhaka, both in the assemblage of Sdkyamuni Buddha, as well as in the three bearded figures in the visit of Mafijuiri to Vimalakirti. Indigenous Yiinnanese influence may be seen in the extremely tall crowns such as that worn by the Emperor Li Chen; in the bare feet occurring among the princes represented with the Ele- ven-headed Avalokitesvara and elsewhere; in the topknots worn by two of these princes, etc.173 The Palace Museum roll should be compared with Chinese and Japanese (Shingon) paintings on the one hand and with Nepalese illustrated manuscripts and Indian Tantric works on the other.174 The images in our roll show relationships with Indian Tantric sculpture, and no doubt would show correspondences also with paintings of the same school, had we any to put side by side with it. The long roll has considerable interest as well for students of the political, social, and religious history of Ytnnan. Besides picturing for us the Emperor Li Chen and his retinue in state dress, in the act of worshipping Buddhist images, it portrays a number of other sovereigns of Yt*nnan among the attendants of the Eleven-headed Avalokitesvara and labels them for us. We may infer that this form of the Compassionate Lord was in some special way favored or looked upon as tutelary by the Yiinnanese Court. At other places here and there throughout the roll, human beings who once trod the soil of Ytinnan are inserted, for example the monk and the lady in the foreground of the picture of Avalokite*vara, Savior from Peril, and it may be possible at some time to identify them. Moreover, we have pictured in this roll the Indian monk with the beard and goatee, who played so important a part in the political and religious history of Yiinnan, some of whose story is told in the Nan Chao Yeh Shih and in the scroll formerly owned by Yamana- ka and Company: and another part of whose story occurs in the latter painting only, told in in- scriptions as well as in pictures.75 The Palace Museum roll gives us a glimpse of the state costumes of the little kingdom of Hou Li, with their long sleeves (modelled on T'ang fashions) and towering crowns and hats. Many of the costumes are modelled after the Chinese pattern, as some of the officials' belted robes, for example, or the armor of the warriors, but the very tall, funnel-shaped hats and crowns are, so far as I know, peculiar to Yunnan, though they may have come there from the Western hinterland. Probably, the topknots worn by some of those not provided with high hats, are also an indigenous 173a The same fashion of doing the hair is to be seen in the Yiinnanese painting formerly in the possession of Yamanaka and Company [i.e. the Fujii Y#rinkan Nan Chao t'u chuan] in the group seated around the iron pillar, in the figure of Hsi-nu-lo coming from his ploughing at the call of his wife to see the Indian monk, and in other cases. In the same painting Hsi-nu-lo, his son Lo-sheng, his wife, and many others are shown with bare feet. [A CS] : See my Foreword and Excursus, figs. 3-6. 174 Compare, for example, many of the plates in Bhattacharyya's Indian Buddhist Iconography, say Plate XX, fig.c, and XXI, with the Avalokite'vara, Savior from Peril, in our painting. 75 Although his name is mentioned neither in the Nan Chao t'u chuan nor in that part of the Nan Chaoyeh shib which tells of his prophecy to the wife of Hsi-nu-lo; in the second section of [the latter] book, which is devoted to the description of the sights and marvels of the country, the author tells of trees planted by [a certain] P'u-t'i-pa-po, or Ta-yu Fa-shih, an Indian monk of the time of the Ta Meng [regime] (NCYS, Ch. 2, p. 90 b; Fr., pp. 196-97). We may have here a reference to the Indian monk of our roll and of the Nan Chao t'u chuan, and consequently a clue to his identity. 137</page><page sequence="64">fashion. We see that many well-dressed people follow the native custom of going barefoot, while others wear shoes, a la Chinoise. The story unfolded to us in the Nan Chaoyeh shih of the calling of Buddhist monks to Court, of the erection of numerous temples and pagodas and images of Avalokitesvara, etc., is corrob- orated by the testimony of the long roll itself, which speaks in no uncertain terms of the impor- tance attached to the Buddhist religion by the Emperor Li Chen. The Palace Museum painting presents evidence of the prevalence of Tantric Buddhism in Ytinnan in the twelfth century and of the existence side by side with it and other forms, of the Ch'an sect. In this painting are what I supposed until very recently to be the earliest representations extant of Bodhidharma, Hui-k'o, Hui-ning and other Ch'an masters; and Bodhidharma's image, so smooth and so slight, differs greatly from the later massive, hairy and glowering monk, who is his traditional image. Mr.Watanabe writes in the Bjutsu kenkyR for September, 1934, of an early Sung dynasty scroll, illustrated with images of Ch'an masters, called Chuan Fa Ching Tsung Ting TsD T'u Chuan.76 Plate IX shows us a portion of the scroll with an image of Bodhidharma resem- bling the image in the long roll far more closely than it does the usual figure of the same monk. Unfortunately, the present writer has neither the time nor the qualifications to follow these stylistic and historical trails. On the other hand, she is eager to pursue the iconography of the roll to the end of her life. In the Introduction, she showed that Sung iconography, aside from works inspired by the Ch'an spirit, is based on the iconography of T'ang. She listed the original documents in the way of paintings, etc., which remain for the study of T'ang and Sung Buddhist iconography; outlined the work already accomplished in this field; and emphasized the need of carrying it further. She stressed the importance of correlating the vast amount of work done in the field of Indian Tantric Buddhism with that done (for the most part by the Japanese) in the corresponding field in the Far East. Several special features which make the Palace Museum roll important were pointed out, for one, the inclusion of two images of the Dhyini Buddha Vairo- cana, whose worship probably existed at Tun-huang only in a rudimentary form. Of the many tens of Tantric divinities pictured in the long roll, some occur among the Tun-huang paintings and others do not; and in more than one case, the image in the roll is the only one of that particular divinity known. The image of Dharmaparamita is the only one of which I know aside from the small figures in the mandalas of the Vajradhdtu: and images such as that of Avalokite vara as a dragon king, to cite only one of several, are not to be found elsewhere, to the best of my know- ledge and belief. Many of the groups, such as the visit of Mafijuiri to Vimalakirti, and the Avaloki- tegvara, Savior from Peril, present interesting parallels with other examples illustrating the same subjects. A large number of the important divinities in the Chinese and Japanese pantheons are rep- resented, with the strange omission of Amitibha Buddha. This blank is all the more remarkable when we consider that there are more than twenty representations of his Dhyini Bodhisattva Avalokiteivara, who is by far the most popular divinity in the roll--though, to be sure, he has more different forms than the others. We remember, too, that the Indian monk who did so much to 176 [ACS]: This picture was later published by Chapin in "Three early portraits of Bodhidharma", Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America, I, I945-46, pp. 78-85 and pl. XII. The Japanese version discussed is a hand-drawn copy done in I 154 after a Chinese original completed in io6i. It is owned by the Kanchiin, a subsidiary of the Shingon headquarters in Ky6to, T6ji. 138</page><page sequence="65">make Buddhism popular in the country and played so prominent a part in its history, was consid- ered an incarnation of this divinity. We may well think that some of those missing sections contained an assemblage or paradise of AmitIbha, comparable to that of Bhaigajyaguru, which is to be found in the roll. The notes made by the writer in Peking during the winter of 1931-32 describe most of the divinities and assemblages depicted in the long roll. By means of an incomplete set of photo- graphs which I have, I have now been able to identify several additional divinities; and from the Nan Chaoyeh shih, of whose existence I did not know in Peking, I was able to establish the date of the painting (this discovery was made in New York in 1933) and to identify a number of the histo- rical personages depicted in the painting. The notes are necessarily unsatisfactory and incomplete; and the writer desires not only to study the original painting over a considerable space of time and to acquire a complete set of photographs,'1 add the missing images and verify her previous descriptions and identifications, but also to make a special study of each divinity, somewhat in the same way in which she studied Cintdmani-cakra Avalokitegvara. 78 These studies would go more deeply into the significance of the images than has been possible in this paper. An adequate treatment of the long roll would require also an explanation of the aniconic symbols and of their meaning, for example, the wheel, the lotus throne, the conch, etc. In this connection, Dr. Coomaraswamy's new book, Elements of Buddhist Iconography, which the writer has only just read after the completion of this study, is of great importance.179 Not only is clear light thrown on the significance of symbols, but also considerable evidence is brought together of the existence of the same images used with the same meanings as far back as Vedic times, corroborating a long- held belief on the part of the present writer. The writer is sensible of her shortcomings as a translator, and as an iconographer as well, not to speak of the difficulties of obtaining adequate tools with which to work and of working without the original painting, or even a complete set of photographs, before her. She would welcome corrections, additions, or suggestions, to be used with due acknowledgment in the more detailed study she hopes to make. Meanwhile, the fate of the painting itself is problematical, as I have said before; and I can really hope for nothing better than that this small effort of mine may stir someone who has the power to find out where the roll is and to preserve it to posterity either in the Palace Museum in Peiping or if, as is possible, it has already left that collection, in some other collection where it may be available for serious study. One way of measuring the richness and complexity of the long roll as an object of study is the fact that both Chapin's "small efort" and my extensive additions and modifications have served chiefly to identify the deities represented, with some of their royal worshippers. As Chapinpointed out, this covers only a part of the iconographicalproblems involved, to say nothing of the others. Neither of us has attempted even such elementaryfurther steps as a detailed comparison of mudris and attributes held, in the case of multi-armed deities, with their cousins in better known branches of late Buddhist art. Even less have we tried to generaliZe with any precision about the degree to 177 [ACS]: Chapin's note on her inability to obtain further photographs from the Palace Museum in Peking, and her ig- norance of "the present whereabouts of the long roll" is omitted as no longer pertinent. sys [ACS]: See n. 14 in Instalment II. 179 A.K.Coomaraswamy, Elements of Buddhbist Iconography, Harvard U.P., Cambridge, 1935. 139</page><page sequence="66">which the roll should be called Tantric (considering, for example, its total lack of overt sexuality) . There remain numberless other questions, which thepresent editor (who is more realistic about his future than Chapin was about "the end of her life" in the zy3 o's) is happy to bequeath to someone else. 140</page></plain_text>
