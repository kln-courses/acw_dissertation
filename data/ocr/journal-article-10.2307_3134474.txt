<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARTS OF DECEPTION: VERBAL PERFORMANCES BY THE RAUTE OF NEPAL JANA FORTIER Southwest State University and Dartmouth College A small population of Tibeto-Burman-speaking hunter-gatherers, the Raute avoid inter- cultural communication with surrounding Nepali-speaking agriculturalists except during barter sessions. During these intercultural interactions, Raute often charm their trading partners with Nepali verbal art, including recitation of rhymes, songs, and blessings. In this article I suggest that Raute perform verbal art in order to draw attention away from their radically different lifestyle and as a way of resisting the hegemonic process of Hin- duization. The article details Raute oral performance as a strategy of verbal indirection, focusing on the context and framing of rhyming proverbs as a means of camouflaging Raute people's actual cultural practices. badarko sapeto Rauteko dhami lai, kheti chdina pati chaina, ke khdnu hdmi lai? 'The monkey's thigh is the shaman's meat, Having no farmland, what shall we eat?' Gogane Raute The Himalayan interface, an area where Tibetic and Indic cultural groups intermingle, represents a place in which cultures can only be described by reference to their surrounding intertwined social spaces. It is here, in western Nepal, that the nomadic Raute, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking hunting and gath- ering society, daily negotiate their cultural identity through the play of cul- tural difference with Indo-Nepalese Hindu agriculturalists. In many ways, Raute identity is not only a cultural construction based on the Raute people's own intracultural values, but one which is based on definition of a cultural self through intercultural experiences. To be Raute is to occupy a marginal social space in relationship to the greater Nepali social and political self. More literally, to be Raute is to live as a small egalitarian society surrounded by mil- lions of people who think and live in a profoundly different social space, one filled with the permanence of villages, fields, and caste hierarchies. Raute could assert their right to live as a nomadic egalitarian people, but this cultural identity would be contested - the right to determine culturally 'correct' behaviour is not negotiated on a level playing-field. The surround- ing Hindu farmers assume a hegemonic ideological stance, and presume that their cultural practices and beliefs are correct while those of the forest-dwellers remain culturally backward and primitive. ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2002. J. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 8, 233-257</page><page sequence="2">JANA FORTIER The Raute's strategy, then, is one of evasion. They shield themselves from unnecessary social interactions, living in forest camps that require as little inter- action with Nepalese farmers as possible. Although Raute avoid farmers' footpaths, water taps, and chance meetings in the forest, physical contact is necessary. All human groups interact, and Raute, too, desire trade items such as iron, cloth, and grain. But when curious villagers ask Raute about their customs, they respond with simple answers, evasive generalities, or a witty proverb or song. And in this space of sociality, where Raute convey their knowledge of Nepali morality through the strategic play of verbal art, Raute foragers and Hindu villagers forge an uneasy relationship. Bhanne kala: verbal art as a cultural strategy Verbal arts are not simply memorized and performed but rather emerge through the dialectic play between text and context. Anthropologists and folk- lorists have come to understand verbal art as something which interacts with each particular social situation and is shaped into a unique performance in the process (Bauman &amp; Briggs 1990; Mannheim &amp; Tedlock 1995). Nowhere is this adaptive, contextual quality more evident than in the performance of bhanne kala (verbal art) by the Raute hunter-gatherers of Nepal. Though a Raute speaker may perform exactly the same rhyme, proverb, or song, it is performed to new audiences as they move to new hunting-grounds and barter woodenwares with Hindu farmers. The context and framing of the nomadic Raute's performances continually change, providing a unique meaning and metanarrative for each performance. Understanding the latent meaning(s) of verbal art, then, requires a high degree of cultural and linguistic competence (Seitel 1977; Siran 1993: 225). Given that they are nomadic, Raute performances adapt to numerous non- recurring circumstances as they travel through the western Nepali foothills. Among several genres of verbal art, Raute most often perform rhyming proverbs (known in Nepali as ukhan tukka or simply ukhan), blessings (ashik), and songs (git). Notably, these performances are not intended for Raute lis- teners; rather, they are intended solely for Nepali-speaking caste Hindu vil- lagers living in western Nepal. As a Tibetic foraging society in danger of cultural assimilation into Hindu society, Raute are situated in a precarious position. They move on the margins of Nepalese society, frequently entering it to trade for iron, cloth, and grain, but avoid being drawn into its infra- structure of constantly changing agendas in development, democracy, educa- tion, and agriculture. Rhyming proverbs enable the Raute traders to negotiate these cultural differences, and in the end, their 'sociable poetics' enable them to strike a balance between cultural accommodation and assimilation (Fortier 2001; Jacobson 1999). Always spoken in domains of uncertainty, Raute ukhan proverbs, the focus of this article, disguise Raute cultural practices from the critical eyes and ears of sedentary villagers. Thus, this genre of Raute verbal art is unique in that it is not recited by traditional story-tellers for the benefit of one's social group (Darnell 1989) or as a form of'ancient oratorical tradi- tions' (Foster 1989: 354).1 Instead, Raute ukhan are performed in order to 234</page><page sequence="3">JANA FORTIER entertain, and mislead, the surrounding dominant population of Nepali agriculturalists. Ukhan are a non-ordinary form of patterned speech containing rhyming elements which are performed at social gatherings - in front of tea-stalls, hotels, and in the front courtyards - of Nepali householders. Since the vast majority of rural Nepali householders are illiterate, ukhdn take on special importance in that they demonstrate beautiful word-play, deep cultural insights, and the performer's cultural competence. Such performances give both Nepali and Raute performers a means of communicating their opinions metaphorically and succinctly. Ukhdn may be glossed as 'proverbs' if, as Kenneth Burke notes, 'proverbs are strategies for dealing with situations' (Burke 1957: 256). Bauman notes, in addition, that proverbs are always to be interpreted as not seriously meaning what they might otherwise mean (Bauman 1984: 9; cf. Austin 1962: 121). The Raute's ukhdn, too, contain a latent meaning, often with a moral force implied in the proverb's performance. The distinctive difference between proverbs from other cultures and ukhdn is that ukhdn have a strong rhyming element.2 While proverbs spoken in English and other languages may be pithy and witty, they often do not rhyme. Broadly then, I gloss Raute's ukhdn as aesthetically pleasing rhymes or proverbs that display linguistic and cultural competence and are performed during critical or confrontational moments of intercultural communication.3 Another feature of Raute performances of ukhan involves an assertion of cultural competence by performing the rhyme in the correct circumstances, with proper intonation, and an overall aesthetically pleasing 'on-stage' perfor- mance. The 'emergent' quality of Raute performances is often apparent in that Raute perform ukhdn that match, or fit, a given circumstance. In this sense, ukhjn are not memorized perfectly and performed as something mechanical, but rather are 'creative, realized, achieved, even transcendent of the ordinary course of events' (Hymes 1981: 81). The Raute men who conducted most of the barter sessions with Nepali householders were particularly adept at per- forming ukhdn. Indeed, on two ocassions I witnessed villagers challenging Raute performers to rhyming duels. Somewhat akin to rhyming duels in Turkey, a duel tests the performers' abilities using the constraints of the rhyming form. By performing well, contestants demonstrate their commu- nicative competence and ultimately their social skills (Dundes, Leach &amp; Ozkrk 1972: 133). Raute contestants performed unusually well and villagers could not match the speed and grace of recitations performed by Raute perform- ers, earning the admiration of Nepali villager audiences. Comparison of Nepali ukhan with thirty-five ukhan performed by various Raute men indicated that the ukhan performed by Raute and those by vil- lagers are stylistically similar (Karma 1996; Lall 1994; Sarma 2000).4 First, the chant length of both groups of performers is similar, having from about six to twenty syllables per stanza and either two or four total stanzas. In addition, ukhdna performed by both groups usually have repetitious rhyming metric verse. Finally, both Nepali and Raute ukhdn usually convey a latent moral message which would not be appropriate to communicate in a straightfor- ward fashion. Various poetic genres in Nepali, such as shamanic chants and Brahmanic verses, also contain the elements of rhyming, alliteration, parallelism, and 235</page><page sequence="4">JANA FORTIER repetition (Gaborieau 1969; Maskarinec 1995; Oppitz 1998; Sales 1994). However, the two genres, shamanic mantar (mantra/songs/chants) and ukhan, are quite distinct in other ways. For example, shamanic songs tend to be quite long; one given by Sales (1994), for example, contains 244 stanzas. Nepali ukhdn, on the other hand, may be as short as four or six words, as in Jaha stri tyaha shri ('Wherever a woman, there [is] prosperity'). Further, Shamanic songs contain messages, but they usually are not used as a form of verbal indirec- tion to communicate something involving a latent moral message. Proverbs possess a latent, normative, and moral function, while mantar are curative, nar- rative, poetic, and convey mythic social information. While the style of Nepali and Raute proverbs may be similar, the function of Raute ukhan is noticeably different from that of Nepali village perform- ers. Whereas one major function of proverb performance among villagers is to give moral advice, for Raute the major function of proverb performance is ultimately part of the drama of impression management. Raute perform ukhan when they need to draw attention away from villagers' prying personal questions. But proverbs are performed whenever the performer needs to emphasize a particular matter indirectly at a vulnerable point in conversation. Like Tzotzil proverbs from Mexico, Raute ukhdn depict situations that cannot always be discussed through direct and open communication (Gossen 1973: 228). For example, barter sessions with villagers can become tense as each partner tries to negotiate a favourable exchange. During a barter session with a Raute elder named Indra, the villagers wanted to hear more ukhdn. One villager asked Indra if he knew any ukhdn to perform when he feels sad. Indra replied that he does not sing ukhan if he feels sad. But it was my impression that Indra actually wanted to focus on the barter rather than chatting with villagers, for he next said, 'We should talk business. We like those who will give more money. We like those who give more grain. Our hearts will hurt if they only give a little bit and we wouldn't be able to sing ukhan.' As if to soften the force of his words, Indra then charmed his listeners with an ukhdn, rhyming Baniya-car byapar garnu parcha Ista-cdr bhat khdnu parcha. Traders have to get a good price And relatives have to eat rice.' The surface meaning is simple and unassuming: it is the nature of traders to do business and of relatives to come and eat with their kin. And the singsong intonations of ukhdn lend a note of frivolity, as if the speaker is simply enter- taining the surrounding listeners. But the latent meaning contains a moral imperative, something like 'Feeding my family is so important that you should- n't feel offended when I press for a good price.' Like proverbs, then, embed- ded in an ukhdn lie insights which draw on culturally embedded knowledge and frame the speaker's performance. Raute ukhdn have a particularly interesting dual quality in that, while they certainly smooth intercultural relations, they also act as a form of cultural disguise. Raute verbal art performances echo the concerns of villagers, yet Raute do not perform ukhdn among themselves and, as full-time hunter- 236</page><page sequence="5">JANA FORTIER gatherers, are utterly unconcerned with the difficulties of farm life. Yet villagers regularly applaud Raute performances for their insight into village problems. This mimicry of village cultural concerns during ukhdn perfor- mances creates a form of 'double-voicing' which uses words, metaphors, and other rhetorical devices from the target audiences' language (Bakhtin 1981; Hill 1995). Subordinate groups such as the Raute need to adopt the linguistic mannerisms of the surrounding dominant community in order to impress their listeners. As Mannheim and Tedlock (1995: 16) describe it, 'If we speak or write in the manner of those other voices rather than quoting them directly ... we produce a "hybrid construction" or "double voicing".' If Raute wish to impress an audience, there can be no greater form of flattery than a display of competence in the target audience's language and verbal art. To be able to perform an ukhdn rhyme indicates cultural compe- tence through a deep understanding of what is viscerally important in the culture. As voyeurs into agricultural society, the foraging Raute see the hard- ships of the agricultural lifestyle even if they themselves reject it as abhorrent to their way of life. Performance of ukhdn which agriculturalists find mean- ingful may smooth intercultural relations, but they ultimately mask the face of Raute reality. Most of the ukhan I heard represented a 'double-voiced' mimicry of Nepali village experiences. These ukhan described the hardships of farming, the dangers of herding, and the intricacies of caste relations. My research assistant, Bishnu, labelled this type of proverb nakkali, 'fake', since they did not describe Raute experiential knowledge. She contrasted these with proverbs which were sakkali,'real', saying that occasionally we heard proverbs which reflected the Raute speaker's own beliefs and practices.When sakkali proverbs were recited, they usually were part of a defensive response during conversation. These 'real' proverbs defended the Raute foragers' right to hunt and live nomadically in the forest. 'Real' proverbs are voiced only during moments of exceptional con- versational conflict, effectively pulling off the elegant mask of the performance to reveal the sweating actor underneath. Here I present several proverbs which disguise Raute intracultural sociality and one rhyme which defends, and reveals, Raute social life. In the shadow offarmers When I use the terms 'farmers' and 'villagers', I am referring to sedentary, Nepali-speaking Hindu caste populations whom Raute encounter during their migrations. Officially, based on voter registration records, approximately 80 per cent of the population in the research area of Jijarkot District is made up of high-caste households, and only 20 per cent represent low-caste house- holds (Fortier 1995: 109). In addition, the research region of Jajarkot District has a varied social landscape made up of both Tibeto-Nepalese and Indo- Nepalese populations which cross-cut social caste boundaries. About 25 per cent of high castes belong to the Tibeto-Burman Magar ethnic group and are incorporated into jdti society as matwdli jdti, or 'drinking castes'. With the periodic migration of the nomadic Raute through Jajarkot, the cultural landscape in the district becomes even more diverse. During my 237</page><page sequence="6">JANA FORTIER field research, from May to October 1997, Raute migrated ten times, and maintained a continual nomadic foraging route, moving camp an average of 2.8 hours walking distance from each previous camp.6 For this reason, Raute seldom maintain social contact with any particular village for more than one month's duration. Local folklore has it that the nomadic Raute use the same migration route once every twelve years. This may have been true in the past, but they have been sighted migrating through Jajarkot District six times since the first researcher sighting in 1968 (Maskarinec pers. comm.; Reinhard 1974). The nomadic Raute are related linguistically and ethnically to other thinly scattered populations ofJangali7 ('forest-dwelling people'), settled Raute, and Raji ethnic groups who are found throughout western Nepal and northern regions of India. (See Map.) The nomadic Raute group, with whom I con- ducted fieldwork, occupy the eastern end of this population area. Few researchers have worked with the nomadic population of Raute and thus little is documented concerning their language (known as Khamci), social relations, or religious beliefs (Fortier 2000; 2001; Reinhard 1974; Singh 1997).8 The Raji have been the subject of rather more research (Bisht 1993; Manandhar 1998; Negi 1982; Rastogi 2000; Reinhard 1973; 1976; Samal 2000;Tiwari 1986;Valli 1998), yet their relation to the nomadic Raute remains in dispute. Most researchers with an interest in the area assume that a dia- lectical language similarity exists among the Raji, Raute, and perhaps the Chepang who live east of the Raute (Fortier n.d.; Matisoff 1995). With the rapid assimilation of these Tibeto-Burman speakers into Nepali, Hindi, and Kumaoni, however, much more work needs to be done in order to assess the interrelations of these dialectical populations. Today these populations are in the process of being assimilated into the dominant Nepalese and Indian societies. Presently, the combined Raji and Raute populations are thought to be between 2000 and 3000, although these figures may be underestimates (Negi 1982; Rawat 1993; Reinhard 1976; Singh 1997). The nomadic Raute's bands normally comprise about 150 people. For a hunting population, this is a rather large band size, but the group often splits into two or even three foraging camps, depending on the size of the forests and the monkey populations available for hunting. As Bird-David points out, modern hunter-gatherers combine hunting and gathering with a wide range of other productive strategies, including wage labour, trade, agricultural cultivation, stock-keeping, as well as the pursuit of income sources such as welfare benefits and government office work (1992: 22; cf. Bird-David 1983). While the Raji combine a number of productive strategies, the nomadic Raute are specialized; they neither farm, help farmers with daily labour, nor raise livestock. And unlike other foragers, Raute do not sell game or other forest products because this would enmesh them in com- petition for hunted game and medicinals with part-time foraging villagers who hunt deer and pheasant, collect honey, and so on (Fortier 1993). Their only means of exchange with non-Raute involves the carving of wooden bowls and boxes (N. koshimal), which they exchange for desired village goods. As one of the more eloquent of the Raute youth expressed it, 'We would rather cut our necks than take up farming.' 238</page><page sequence="7">JANA FORTIER Map: Raute and Raji terr ories. Because of the ability of Raute to carve wooden bowls and boxes for grain exchange, it might be thought that they should be referred to by a term such as 'artisanal peripatetics' rather than hunter-gatherers. However, such a designation would be inaccurate for a number of reasons. First, while it is true that Raute depend on bartering for grain, the same may be said for all hunter-gatherers. By erasing the real relationships forged between hunter- gatherers and agriculturalists, we lose sight of the importance of these groups' mutual interdependence. For example, in a study of Mbuti-villager relations, the anthropologist John Hart (1978) sees the relationship between these groups as part of a balanced mutual dependency in which foragers obtain carbohydrate-rich foods while villagers obtain forest products from foragers. And this relationship is not one in which one side wins and the other loses, for they are locked into a relationship of mutual interdependence. In fact, Bailey and Peacock emphasize that none of the 170,000 Pygmies scattered throughout central Africa have ever been known to live for more than a month without consuming some sort of agricultural produce (Bailey &amp; Peacock 1988: 92). In short, contemporary foragers worldwide are dependent on farmers for grain and other agricultural products. Like many foragers worldwide, Raute must create a relationship of mutual interdependence with area agriculturalists. While they do so through the barter of their wooden bowls and boxes, they do not identify themselves as a caste or jati defined occupationally like the specialist artisanal communities of the Hindu caste hierarchy. 239</page><page sequence="8">JANA FORTIER Raute may perform proverbs and blessings for villagers, but, in general, they do not maintain intimate social ties with sedentary agriculturalists. This is not surprising, given that agriculturalists in most areas of the world actively discriminate against non-agriculturalists (Woodburn 1995). While farmers usually know that Raute hunt monkeys, they know surprisingly little else about them. Some of the elder farmers have met Raute foragers several times and have heard more gaph (N. gossip, pleasurable talk), such as the fact that Raute marriage ceremonies take place next to large rivers, or that they refrain from using water taps and other open water sources. But since farmers gen- erally believe that living in the forest is inferior to living in villages, Raute do not share information about themselves and the farmers generally do not want to learn Raute customs. In classic ethnocentric fashion, Nepali farmers believe that plough agriculture, livestock-herding, and other village-controlled cultural activities represent a superior lifestyle to forms of production such as swiddening, forest-foraging, mining, or other activities outside village spaces in the uncultivated, jangali forests. Disguising Rdute kinship and marriage forms The Raute people do not share the Nepali view of culture over nature, nor do they practise asymmetrical marriage exchange found in hierarchical Hindu caste organization. Instead, Raute patriclans reciprocate marriage alliances in order to create a balanced whole. These symmetrical kinship relations, in which male Ego marries either his father's sister's daughter or his mother's brother's daughter, are strikingly similar to kinship rules reported for the Byangsi (Byansi) of northwestern Nepal (Allen 1975). Generally, this senti- ment of reciprocity is similar to the cosmology of many Tibeto-Burman groups, such as the Tamang of central Nepal, in which 'the values that govern marriage are one expression of ideals of balanced reciprocity that extend to all aspects of life and frame experience in general' (Holmberg 1989: 51). Like- wise, Raute marriage practices express ideals of balanced exchange between their two patriclans, the Kalyal and the Raskoti. Marriage represents a joining of clans as much as it is a joining of individuals. Weddings, involving several couples near the banks of large rivers, symbolize the joining of the two clans as one people. After marriage, the new households are neo-local with prefer- ence for situating tents (K. nau) near the husband's paternal elders (K. koka). One of the men we interviewed, a bachelor of about 26 years, named Laksman, was looking forward to his marriage in the late autumn. In order to be ready, Laksman said he must first be 'filled' with knowledge, and he drew an imaginary line at his eyebrows, indicating that he had to learn a little more to be completely 'filled' and ready for the transition from bachelor to married adult male. Young women, on the other hand, are seen as 'naturally' and easily filled with knowledge about their adult roles (cooking, foraging, weaving rope, etc.). As Laksman joked, 'They [women] only need to learn how to eat.' Women begin choosing their future husbands soon after first menstruation, creating an age difference of about ten years between husband and wife. As Laksman commented, 'I haven't got married. I almost had to marry before because one girl wouldn't leave me alone. Her mother and father 240</page><page sequence="9">JANA FORTIER liked me a lot. But I didn't marry her. My elder brother married her.' Much discussion ensues among camp members about whether or not the couple is a good match. As Laksman pointed out, 'If mother, brother, and sister-in-law approve, I'll bring [home a wife]. After mother and father approve, then I also will approve.' Marriage partners are chosen with regard to keeping a balance between Raute extended families. The desirable match between families would be a marriage between a set of'brothers' (parallel cousins or actual sib- lings) and a set of'sisters'. Note that bilateral cross-cousin marriages make no preference for father's sister's daughter (FZD) or mother's brother's daughter (MBD). Nepali villagers would approve of MBD but find FZD a highly unde- sirable marriage choice.9 Thus Raute deflect questions from farmers and dis- guise the details of their marriages. With a different kinship and marriage system from that of the surround- ing Indo-Nepalese population, Raute avoid talking about these subjects, using stategies of impression management (Goffman 1959; Manzardo 1982). For example, when asked about their jdt or caste, Raute usually state that they are the ban ko raja, 'kings of the forest', adding that their jdt is therefore Thakuri. One of the elders, named Man Bahadur, presented the following caste origin story to a listening villager: God comes in the form of Braha, Bishnu, Mahaswor, and Bisokarma ... Braha is a Bahun priest, Bishnu is a King, Mahaswor is a Magar, and Bishokarma is a Kami ... From the four castes there were seven brothers and you and we are descended from these seven brothers. There were seven brothers eating food at one house. For the seven brothers there were seven plates of rice. All the brothers started to eat. One brother went out to work. All of them were eating their own plates of rice. But Maila [second eldest son] ate his own plate of rice and his father's, too. Then father was hungry. Father said to Maila, 'Why did you eat my rice, didn't you think I'd be hungry?' Maila said to his father, 'Don't thrash me - instead I'll run away from home.' After that Maila went to the jungle and started cutting wood -'twak twak', he cut wood.We Rautes are descended from that Maila son... In this oral recitation, Indra begins by showing off his knowledge of a folk classification of caste hierarchy, specifying that the Raute descend from the second of four separate, hierarchically arranged kinds of people: Brahman, Thakuri, Magar, and Kami. The number seven, important in Tibeto-Burman and shamanic religious practices (Oppitz 1983), is not explained, but Man Bahadur probably assumes it to be an auspicious number. Similar versions of caste-based origin stories are also told by other Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups in Nepal (see Jacobson 1999, for Sherpa and Tamang caste origin stories). In this story, the Raute are descended from the second brother, inferring that they rank second in the caste hierarchy. If Raute claimed to be descended from the first brother, this would be taken as a sign that they claimed kinship with Brahmans, an impossible claim since they are illiterate, do not control large land-holdings, and know little of Hindu religious orthodoxy. The Raute could plausibly claim to be descended from either the third or fourth broth- ers, making them descendants of Magars or Kamis, but each of these choices would be problematic. Historically, even though Magars were codified in Nepal's Muluki Ain or 'Chief Law' of 1854 as part of the non-enslavable alcohol-drinking castes (N. namasine matwali: Hofer 1979: 45), Magar living in 241</page><page sequence="10">JANA FORTIER regions in which Raute migrate and trade were often enslaved and worked as servants to the high castes. Knowing this, the Raute would distance themselves from primordial association with Magars. Likewise, if Raute claimed kinship with the untouchable (pdni nacalnya) Kami caste, they would suffer the same cultural ostracism as low castes have suffered (Parish 1998). This origin story, then, identifies the Raute people as belonging to the high social caste stratum, known as tagddhdri or 'Wearers of the holy cord', despite their lack of this ritual adornment.10 One might think that villagers would disapprove or reject such claims to high-caste status. However, villagers who heard this story seemed to accept it as authentic. Perhaps they approved, since this origin story allows villagers to interact physically with Raute traders and their wares without fear of ritual pollution, yet also accounts for the Raute's interest in crafting wooden objects from the forest. Sometimes a Raute interacting with villagers will tell an origin story which links the two groups within the caste system, but at other times Raute use the shorter rhyming proverbs to convey a sense of cultural similarity. Pithy and terse, proverbs are by nature ambiguous. By staging these acts of 'verbal indirection' (Jacobson 1999; Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1975), Raute successfully obscure their lifestyle. In the Nepali language, verbal indirection can be accomplished in many ways. At the syntactic level, a common Nepali linguistic practice involves subject omission, with the sentence's subject defined by the pronominal form of the verb suffix. In the question and answer exchange below, note how the subject is inferred from the verb inflections: jari khan-e? divorce payment-OBJ eat-FUT-INTEROG Will [you,l, e, she, they] take the divorce payment? dan cha ta jari ko lyai de rich-OBJ be.3S thus.EVID divorce.POSS bring + give-COMMAND.FAMILIAR [He, she] is wealthy so l[he, she] should pay [me] the divorce's settlement Nepali speakers commonly omit the subject noun and leave it to the listener to infer the actor from contextual cues such as verb inflections. This sentence strategy is commonly used during the utterance of a proverb, since it presents normative statements about proper behaviour without seeming too authori- tative and disrupting the social space of enjoyable shared talk between speakers. For example, when Raute arrived in Jajarkot District, local villagers circulated social myths about Raute. One story told of a Raute woman who had left her husband for another Raute man. In the villagers' account, the first husband's family, in compensation, would jari khdne, 'eat the divorce payment', from the new husband's family by taking as compensation over 100 wooden bowls for the loss of the wife. Among villagers in the region, such 'divorce payment' is fairly common; money and other movable property is paid to the first husband by the second husband to compensate for the loss of the wife's labour. Raute had not heard this story, and in fact it was not true. While I knew that Raute do not practise jdri, none of the listening Nepali villagers knew this.Yet upon hearing the 'Raute divorce story', the Raute elder named Indra fuelled the gossip by declaring: 242</page><page sequence="11">JANA FORTIER syakhu banau gumu gumu, doko bunya shydulya dan cha ta jdriko lydi de, bhuto nagara bydule Make the umbrella round its course Line the basket through, You've got wealth so pay for this divorce, Don't burden us with this shrew. The first two lines are a 'set-up', a way to get the rhyme humming. The rhyme's first two lines employ a thematic alliteration: it is right that an umbrella must be made round, a basket must be lined, and the verse con- cludes in the last two lines that wealthy families must pay for stealing a wife. In using these harsh belittling words, villagers felt the Raute performer's appreciation for the fear, shame, and anger that divorce creates. The second two lines, however, are the ones that deliver a powerful punch. In the third line, Indra uses grammatical features for dramatic effect, choosing the famil- iar verb 'de', which is the most inferior verb form in a range of four possible levels of address (royal, formal, informal, and familiar). Men employ this level of address when speaking to children, wives, and inferiors as an indicator of power and familiarity (Brown &amp; Gilman 1960; Friedrich 1966). In the last line, Indra chose bydule (N. byduli, 'wife'), which is an uncommon lexical choice for this region. It was a good choice, however, because byaule not only contributes to the aesthetics of the rhyme, but lends a Sanskritic moral tone as well. Packed with many layers of meaning, this rhyme was greeted with much approval. In Nepal, it is almost impossible for a woman to leave her husband and live alone. Instead, if a Nepali woman is unhappy with her in-laws and/or husband, she can find another husband and abandon the first. In these cases, the first family will demand a divorce settlement as compensation for their pain, suffering, and loss of labour. But do the villagers really know whether or not Raute practise jdri divorce? Indra did not straightforwardly say some- thing like, 'No, we think divorce is a really bad social practice', because the villagers would be upset by such a contradiction of their own social customs. While the jdri system is common among villagers in western Nepal, Raute nomads could never accumulate a surplus of 100 wooden bowls as divorce payment, nor would they dream of negotiating kinship problems in such a litigious manner. Instead, Indra entertained and misled his listeners with a pithy proverb that reminded villagers of the moral justification for jdri. Indra's rhyme, then, made it appear as if he completely understood the intricate prob- lems of marriage and divorce. Like their fascination with jdri, Nepalis also are intrigued by other trans- gressions of Hindu marriage rules. Marriage outside one's caste is one such transgression common in Jajarkot district. One of my research assistants, Sita, a Jaisi Brahman (of mixed caste ancestry), was interested in the Raute people's knowledge of Hindu marriage and descent. During one of our interviews with the Raute elder named Indra, Sita wanted to ascertain how Raute social caste is inherited, since her mother is Thakuri (royal caste) and her father is Brahman. Sita asked, 'Does your jdt [caste] come from your father or your mother?' Indra's response to this was: 243</page><page sequence="12">JANA FORTIER Rotiko tauko hundaina, aimeko jata hundaina Bread doesn't have a head, and women have no caste." This response was warmly received and applauded by listening villagers, since Indra's rhyme validated Sita's condition and the condition of many rural Nepali Hindus who often transgress orthodox Hindu kinship rules. One lis- tener said,'That's good.Women don't have a caste because they can marry up into another caste and their children become that of their husband. Or, if they marry down a rank, same thing. Like a roti, women have substance, but they don't have a head.' Looking further into the dynamics of Indra's metaphor of rural Hindu women as roti bread, we can see that roti is a round, anthropomorphic shape lacking appendages. This evokes the dominant society's key conceptual domains in the form of root metaphors of embodiment in several ways. Indra employed a metaphor of women as bread that mediates experience through the likeness of the human body to a round piece of bread and, secondly, through the bodily sensations of making and consuming bread. Having 'no head' links women to 'no caste' because women do not make decisions about their own marriages and also because they lose their natal caste status upon marriage. Also, women are linked to bread because they spend hours every day making bread; they are intrinsically linked to an important form of every- day subsistence. Further, women are likened to bread since, as new brides, women are symbolically eaten: the in-law's family draws upon the new bride's ability to nourish the family through her hard work. But is this metaphor of women as bread indigenous to Raute cultural expe- rience? Although Raute women occasionally cook roti bread, they generally prefer to eat cereals in one of two other ways. They often cook grain into a mildly alcoholic grain beer (K.jhad) and store it in large containers (K.jhum). Or, they grind it into flour and roast it into sdtu, a dry grain preparation like Tibetan tsampa. Raute women and men consume handfuls of this roasted grain preparation while foraging in the forest during the day and drink cupfuls of beer each time they return to camp. Thus the 'source domain' (Quinn 1991: 66) that Raute draw upon during performances does not originate in Raute experience. Rather, it represents a form of'double-voicing' in which Raute echo the cognitive and cultural cues of the target audience. What is similar to Raute experience, however, is the sense of gendered opposition evoked by the roti bread proverb. But unlike Nepali experience, in which men are symbolically reproduced as the positive and women as the negative force, for Raute couples gendered roles are less hierarchical and more complementary. Further, Raute women's natal identity is not lost after mar- riage.Villagers are unaware that, unlike asymmetrical Hindu marriage arrange- ments in which women do not 'have a head', Raute clans practise symmetrical marriage arrangements. Raute inner social spaces are thus protected from vil- lagers, who cannot guess that Raute women do not lose their clan status after they marry - they do in fact 'have heads'. But do villagers really believe that Raute practise orthopractic high-caste Hindu marriage forms? Although opinions vary, I think that most villagers believe that Raute attempt standard Thakuri caste marriage rules but fail 244</page><page sequence="13">JANA FORTIER because they live in the forest and are ignorant of the intricacies of high-caste marriage etiquette. During one conversation, a Raute named Krishna, known for his trading prowess, described his family and marriage. Beginning with a romantic ukhdn, he rhymed in a singsong voice, Hat ma asi kammar ma khurpeto ghas kataune bahra bise dura hdmi Dang ma sadgdi basoune Harvest fodder holding knife in hand and sheath on hips, Stay with me in Dang [district] for twelve and twenty years Krishna elicited approval for his ukhdn, which played upon Nepali ideals of the beauty and rhythm of a farm woman's work. We could imagine a woman bent over along the edge of a field, rhythmically swishing the curved asi (hasiyd) knife and tossing handfuls of grass fodder into a basket. And we picture a young man teasingly calling out to her from the field edges, promising to love her always. Then Krishna described his own kinship relationships, saying I have three brothers - Bhakta, Ram, and Dhan. We are four brothers but now we are living separately. I'm the eldest. When we were in Jajarkot, remember Indra? We four brothers married his four daughters. I married the eldest, Dhan married the second [maili], Bhakta married the third [saili], and Ram married the youngest [kanchi].Yerka [another cousin-brother] married the daughter of my in-law's younger brother ... [con- tinues to repeat and clarify] ... My wife and I have two sons. You've seen one of them when we went to Jajarkot [district capital]. After a pause, Krishna continued, When we get married we arrange it. If somebody is interested, we go there and talk with them. We ask for their daughter. We arrange the day and date. We have to arrange it with the daughter's side. We have to arrange it from the son's side. Then everyone comes together for the marriage. We have to say that we'll come to take your daughter. If a girl and boy love each other they can't just marry. They have to ask mother and father. We have to go to the relatives. When my marriage occurred, father went to Indra's home and said,'Will you give your daughter to my son?' Father said that Indra's daugh- ter and his son Krishna [speaking about himself] should get married. If we don't want to, we don't have to marry that person. How can we know what's really in our hearts? In some ways this story combines both orthopractic elements, or elements which mimic high-caste rules of marriage, and elements common to Raute marriage customs. First, Krishna is proud to be linked in an extensive 'brother- sister' exchange circle involving four (or five, counting Yerka) 'brothers' married to a set of sisters. Note that when I discussed this marriage alliance in later interviews, I found that Krishna's brothers are, in kinship terms, parallel cousins. The sisters, however, are all consanguinal daughters of Indra (plus Indra's BD). Brother-sister exchange marriage is common among Raute and, while uncommon among Nepali Hindus, there is nothing taboo about brother-sister exchange between families as long as the couples are of the same caste, not parallel cousins, and the wife-giving household is of lower status than the wife-taking family. Nothing in Krishna's story indicates a transgres- sion of these kinship rules. Secondly, Krishna knows that arranged marriages are preferred to love marriages or marriage by capture, the two other common marriage forms in the region. Although he mentions the arranged aspect of 245</page><page sequence="14">JANA FORTIER Raute marriage, Krishna stresses the balanced nature of Raute alliances, noting that each party involved has to be consulted. From listening to this and other accounts of Raute marriages, I would be inclined to describe Raute matches as consensual, communal, and bilateral rather than being arranged in classic caste Hindu fashion. But Krishna's account tactfully emphasizes that all parties help to 'arrange' the marriage. Finally, note that if Krishna wants to avoid appearing as a cultural Other, he has continually to agree with the leading questions of villagers. Fortu- nately, this is easy since villagers often supply the 'correct' answer in their questions. For example, during the conversation described above, at one point we were discussing the arrangement of a bride for Krishna's 17-year-old son (which actually will not occur for several years, since Raute males marry after they are 'filled' with knowledge, but Krishna does not explain this to the listening villagers). One elite villager named Nanda asked, 'Who would give that village girl'2 [to your son]? Her father?' To this question, Krishna responded, 'Her marriage will be done by her father, maybe so' (us bibahd babule ta gareko hold ho). Ambiguous as the reply may seem, it satisfied the audience. Clearly, if Raute want to appear to be cultural insid- ers, they must learn to perform in ways that are consonant with the standards of the dominant society. If appearing to perform arranged marriages for 17-year-old sons will make Raute seem less threatening, then they will perform nakkali (fake) cultural scripts to their Nepali audiences, while continuing to carry on their sakkali (real) lives in the privacy of their forest camps. Verbal artistry of pastoralism and the nomadic life During interethnic communication, one universal problem is that different cultures do not share the same metaphors. As Robin Ridington notes, 'It is only when we attempt discourse with people whose assumptive worlds are different than our own that we find ourselves talking at cross-purposes and discover that our different metaphors have been supporting different realities' (1990: 240). Using metaphors which make it appear that Raute share similar cultural systems is one means of assuring villagers that Raute are their fellow countrymen (N. deshi) rather than suspect foreigners (N. bideshi). Additionally, verbal performances enable Riute to move into villager-controlled social spaces, such as nearby forests, with less fear of being forcibly assimilated or even assaulted.Villagers often wanted Raute to confirm, through demonstrated knowledge of farming, animal-herding, religion, and social caste information, that Raute are similar to the dominant surrounding agriculturalists. By recit- ing proverbs that contain metaphors reflecting villagers' experiences, Raute create a space of common ground with Nepali villagers, even if it is only a superficial one. One ukhdn tukka that I heard a number of times, from different Raute speakers, involved pastoralism. The first time I heard it was during a trade in a large village with a villager who wanted to know about the Raute people's animal-herding. Assuming that they too must have water buffaloes and goats, 246</page><page sequence="15">JANA FORTIER the villager was wondering how Raute herded animals (Raute do not raise livestock). By way of answer, the Raute trader, the middle-aged elder named Krishna, replied, lekh bata bhaisi halyo Nepal ko ban kasogdri jogai halyou bhaisyouli ko dan? Buffalo wander the mountain ridges of Nepal's forests How can [we] protect our buffalo-wealth [from falling]? Since Krishna was surrounded by several talkative villagers, he merely had to recite and then sit back while the villagers all began commenting on the wisdom of the rhyme. One listener said, 'How true. The buffalo are one form of property, and the cowherd has to watch them well. The cowherd's task is difficult. How to save them from falling off the cliffs?' After the villagers had learned that Raute appreciate the difficulties of livestock-herding, they asked no further questions. They assumed that Raute, too, store their wealth in cattle as farmers commonly do. Given the inherent wisdom of the rhyme, the villagers assumed that Raute had experienced the dangers of herding water buffalo. Yet this rhyme repre- sents another notable example of the Raute's use of verbal art as an evasive form of verbal indirection. In this rhyme, Krishna actually did not state who herds animals, because Nepali allows subjectless sentences and is thus amenable to strategies of verbal indirection (Jacobson 1999). Like other Indo-European languages such as Hindi and Bangla (Bengali), Wilce notes that 'Subjects, par- ticularly pronominal subjects, can be unrealized (unexpressed) without serious consequence; ambiguities are blocked, to some extent, by the "rich system of verb-agreement"' (Wilce 1998: 8). Krishna avoided saying exactly who is herding the water buffalo, and this leads the listener to infer that Raute cowherds perform the protective action. Using this clever rhyme as an 'on-stage performance', Krishna avoided expos- ing the inner social life of the Raute to curious villagers.Villagers were pre- vented from going'backstage' (Goffman 1959) and learning that Raute never herd buffalo, never eat water buffalo, and have never worked as cowherds for villagers. The Raute really have no shared experience with the villagers con- cerning pastoralism, but this difference is erased by Raute performances which assure villagers that Raute understand village life and concerns. Interestingly, during another interview session, I listened to Laksman perform the same rhyme but this time without a village audience. Laksman sang to me his version of the buffalo rhyme, Buffalo wander on the mountain ridge in Nepal's forests, How can I, Laksman, save my buffalo wealth? I waited for a moment and Laksman offered a different interpretation, 'If Nepal's forests disappear,' he said, 'our lives will be very difficult. You use the forests to raise buffalo, goats, and cattle. Our wealth, too, comes from the forests. We make koshi, woodenwares, from the forest. We take everything from the forest.' 247</page><page sequence="16">JANA FORTIER Only in private do Raute admit that their own concept of'wealth' is based not on cattle but on the forests themselves. As an 'immediate-return society' (Woodburn 1982), Raute do not accumulate wealth in objects such as cattle, gold, or land. Instead, they perceive the forest as a giant store of wealth which they use. By claiming usufruct rights in the forest rather than ownership rights over agricultural land, the Raute's wealth requires storage of surplus no greater than a few containers of beer. Thus, in Laksman's eyes, both Raute and the villagers have wealth but in different forms, and each need the forest to help them preserve their wealth and way of life. Raute disguise their non-involvement in pastoralism because villagers view herding animals as a cultural good. When villagers hear that Raute hunt monkey rather than raising domestic animals, they sometimes offer Raute pregnant animals as enticements to learning a proper pastoral lifestyle. For example, a local Nepali development worker, Hekraja, gave a Raute trader two pregnant goats along with instruction on how to raise them. After a few weeks, the Raute camp moved out of the area bringing the goats with them. The development worker felt satisfied, believing that he had participated in the Raute's social improvement (N. samdj sudhdr) by teaching them the rudi- ments of pastoralism. Unbeknown to him, when the full-moon ritual day began, the Raute celebrated by sacrificing domesticated meat (K. pyad, in this case goats) to their hunting deity, Berh, in exchange for allowing them to pursue hunted meat (K. sydd, in this case rhesus monkeys). This monthly ritual sacrifice, which always involves slaughter of any goats or sheep obtained from bartering, is something Raute will not discuss with villagers. In fact, villagers have no idea that the Raute even make a lexical distinction between domes- ticated and hunted meat. Later, when the development worker travelled into the Raute's new hunting territory, he asked how the livestock raising was going. A Raute elder told Hekraja, 'Oh, the goats died ...'. To the develop- ment worker, then, Raute appeared as inept herders. If Hekraja had known about the sacrifices, he would have been angry, since to kill a pregnant animal is considered sinful in Hindu theology. But Raute would rather have villagers believe that they are poor livestock herders or even immoral than allow them into their inner social space where monkeys are privileged over domesticated animals. Placing Rdute verbal art in context While interesting as texts, Raute performers' ukhdn are also interesting con- textually because they provide insight into Raute-villager social relations. In this concluding section, I focus on the contextualization of ukhan, discussing ways in which Raute verbal art represents a strategy for inclusion within Indo-Nepalese society yet, paradoxically, is also a strategy to maintain this Tibeto-Nepalese group's cultural autonomy. As perennial nomads, Raute experience a unique dilemma in that they want to appear to be cultural insiders when in fact, from the dominant society's point of view, they represent cultural outsiders. Given that the Raute do not farm, herd animals, live in villages, or speak Nepali as a native language, their obvious 'outsider' status has similarities to the marginalization of low castes 248</page><page sequence="17">JANA FORTIER and their feelings of being excluded and stigmatized. In order to mitigate such marginalization, low-caste groups sometimes create 'narrative subversions of hierarchy' in which they tell stories that invert the caste order (Parish 1998). Raute speakers, however, tell 'narratives of inclusion' in which they claim high-caste status and in general validate the social caste hierarchy. Among high castes, this assertion of high status enables Raute to sit in the homes of high castes, eat cooked food offered by high-caste householders, and maintain a sense of equality while trading and travelling among villages. Thus both their high-caste origin story and ukhdn proverbs enable Raute speakers to assert an 'insider' status. Notably, Raute not only desire an 'insider' status when travelling through strange lands, but do not want to be perceived as of low status, since low castes are obviously poorer, less respected, and have access to fewer political and economic resources; conditions which Raute can clearly witness. Raute are masters of impression management; I noticed how, while trading, they tended to agree with high castes about the low castes' proper low social place. When dealing with low castes, however, I found that Raute men are willing to sleep at low-caste houses and agree with them that people should all be treated equally. From the Raute trader's perspective, the best business is done by complimenting the trading partner, regardless of social caste. Another technique used by Raute to gain respect and avoid assimilation involves creating an aura of wisdom around themselves as they perform their ukhan with their timeless truths. Raute proverbs are timeless in that they express an essential truth which conveys a deeper meaning than the mere words themselves. Raute proverbs are effective because these 'wise words', like the Apache's 'wise words' (Basso 1976), convey moral truths by which villagers ought to live. When a Riute performs a proverb with its insight into Nepali cultural ideals, villagers comment on the 'truth' of the performance. Unlike narratives that convey a sense of time and place ('once upon a time ...'), ukhan proverbs transcend time and place, by extension making Raute also appear timeless and placeless. The performer absorbs some of this truth and thus ukhan project onto them an aura of wisdom and worthiness.13 What is most remarkable about Riute's metaphor-making is its adept cross- cultural sensitivity. Generally, intercultural communication is fraught with miscues and wrong assumptions about what information to convey (Gumperz 1982). But Raute have learned to select metaphors which suit the dominant society's pre-existing culture models. As intercultural communication, their verbal performances are situated at vulnerable points in which Raute risk revealing their cultural practices. Demonstration of communicative compe- tence is crucial at these conversational points. Since Raute are suspiciously incompetent agropastoralists by Nepali social standards, their verbal perfor- mances act as a rebuttal of this observation. Perhaps if Riute know how to speak in socially appropriate ways, then by extension, villagers can assume that Raute know how to act in socially appropriate ways. Performance of verbal art is not only a gesture of competence but a tech- nique for survival. Like hunter-gatherers elsewhere, Raute carry most of their tools in the form of technique rather than technology. As Robin Ridington notes (1990: 86), among hunter-gatherers 'artifacts that must be carried from place to place have a high cost in that they compete with infants, clothing, 249</page><page sequence="18">JANA FORTIER and trail food for the very limited carrying capacity of the human body. For such people, techniques that can be carried in the mind and implemented using locally available resources are far more cost-effective than artifacts that must be carried in the hand.' Considered from this perspective, ukhan are such a resource - technologies in the mind. As if he were training me in a survival technique, Indra once told me, 'Here, I will teach you my ukhan.'14 Their use of ukhan, I believe, is recog- nized by Raute themselves as a necessary tool to reduce tension during trading sessions with villagers. For example, Gogane Raute, a decent negotiator, could not get Nandakali, a village woman, to fix a fair barter for her grain. In anger, she dashed his wooden bowl on the courtyard floor. Those of us watching were frightened by this outburst. Rather than react violently, however, Gogane simply said, manche herda ramro bydbahar herda camro She appeared to be a good woman But perhaps she's just a selfish woman. In his backhanded flattery, Gogane adroitly managed to be diplomatic, even when arguing with an angry farm woman. Nandakali had to smile and compose herself and the transaction of grain for woodenware eventually occurred. In barter sessions, then, a repertoire of verbal art can be seen as a negotiating tool. Ukhan proverbs are generally performed under conditions of conversational uncertainty, as in the case above where Gogane and Nandakali could not agree on a fair exchange. Conditions of conversational uncertainty often arise when villagers question Raute about their apparent Otherness. Raute speakers can usually avoid a direct answer by performing ukhan and other verbal arts. But every once in a while, ukhan are performed in order to defend rather than to deceive. These ukhan are more spontaneous, less marked off from the rest of the conversation, as if they emerge during conversation to embody some- thing important about Raute experience. During one of my first interviews with Gogane, he had this exchange with a listening villager: VILLAGER. Would you like to go to Kathmandu? GOGANE. It would cost a lot, though I'd like to travel [there]. I'm scared [to go there]. VILLAGER. One, ah, in India, there was a [Raute] soldier ... from that soldier we took a koshi ... it is at my house, yeah. GOGANE [with disbelief]. Where is this Raute? How could a Raute be a soldier? VILLAGER. Yes, really. GOGANE. That couldn't be true. VILLAGER. [He] said he was Raute ... GOGANE. No Raute has ever even studied [in school]. Constantly during this interview, Gogane explained why he did not want to take up farming, why he did not want to attend school, and that he practised Hindu rituals properly. At one point, he stated, 'Your house is huge and you farm rice land - that's you. My lot is to live in the forest and eat the fruits 250</page><page sequence="19">JANA FORTIER of the forest. My lot is to eat rhesus and langur.' Gogane concluded this defence of his people's moral right to hunt monkey, saying: badar ko sapeto Rdute ko dhdmi ldi, kheti chdina pati chdina, ke khdnu hami Idi? The monkey's thigh is the shaman's meat, Having no farmland, what shall we eat? With a final flourish, he exclaimed,'There, I've said it.' In Gogane's ukhdn above, I interpret this as signalling that he wanted to defend his moral right to hunt monkey, to live a nomadic existence, and to live as a forager rather than an agriculturalist. He is trying to emphasize his message through the marked poetic form of the ukhdn, to make his words carry a moral message which the listener will contemplate. In this sense, proverbs may have a trans- formative power. In the first line of this revealing ukhdn, Gogane appeals to the listener to understand that Raute identity is built around monkey hunting and intra- cultural sharing. In Raute society, hunting is accomplished with nets and axes rather than with guns or bows and arrows. Based on this communal hunting technique, Raute share their food and other property equally. Monkey meat is divided according to loose rules of sharing which (some- times) give thigh meat parcels to Raute ritual specialists (Fortier 2000). In the second line Gogane says, in effect, 'we don't farm, so what do you expect us to eat?' He defends their right to live as hunter-gatherers rather than as sedentary agriculturalists even though Raute have been offered farmland on many occasions in exchange for agreeing to become settled agriculturalists. The Raute performer's cadence and word-choice in this ukhdn illustrate his adroit creation of an ukhdn which is different from other ukhan, most notably in that it is not a timeless saying that can be used in many spoken contexts. While other Raute men might on occasion use this ukhdn, it is too 'danger- ous' to be used around villagers, since it draws attention to Raute monkey hunting. This is an ukhan that reveals, rather than disguises, something about Raute social life. Furthermore, this ukhdn is idiosyncratic in that villagers cannot perform this proverb in another context, such as to say 'I'm starving and landless'. Listening villagers (two high-caste farmers, my research assistant, and myself) appreciated the beauty of the ukhdn for its rhythm and original- ity but not for any village-based moral insight. Gogane's ukhdn, however, uses metaphor to say something that cannot be expressed overtly. Note the punch-line, 'What can we eat?' (ke kha-nu ha-mi lai?), a question which used the repetition of stressed syllables for emphasis. The answer can only be 'monkey meat'. Thus the latent meaning of this ukhan can be glossed as 'We utterly depend on monkey for our food and we refuse to take up farming.' Gogane's utterance is clever in that it 'backs off from whatever may be aggressive in his words, and the use of a proverb enables the person being talked about to dodge what, if it were said plainly, would be offensive' (Siran 1993: 226-7). Perhaps Gogane created this ukhdn because he felt under pressure to come up with something memorable. The proverb, as John Leavitt has remarked 251</page><page sequence="20">JANA FORTIER (1997: 39) of poetry, is a form of marked language and in its poetic form creates in the listener a marked experience. Unlike ordinary speech, proverbs are uniquely transmissible. They are short in length and thus easy to remem- ber and repeat. Some Nepali ukhan, for example, have been used since the days of Prithivi Narayan Shaha.15 Unlike shamanic prose and the poetry of the literate elite, however, the oral performative nature of ukhan mark this genre apart as especially democratic and open for public consumption. They are not part of shamanic knowledge which must first be 'consumed' by the ritual specialist (Mumford 1989: 52ff.; Oppitz 1998: 340). Not only ritual specialists, but anyone can learn ukhdn if they desire to perform them, something which is probably appealing to members of an egalitarian society. Since most ukhdn are relatively short and easy to memorize, they constitute a poetic form very different from Hindu scriptures which are read periodically by high-caste elites. For example, I enjoyed listening to dshirabad Sanskritic poetry for the festive time of Mage Sakranti (beginning of the month of Mag), but I do not remember and recite snippets of the text. These texts are read by men and women who are edu- cated in reading these verses, and many people, including those of low caste, are not normally allowed to perform them. Epilogue Sadly, the Raute people may soon accede to the pressures of assimilation even though they employ ukhan and other verbal art as defensive strategies. Not only villagers but also international development agencies and the Nepalese government have persistently attempted to assimilate the nomadic Raute, believing this to be an act of social improvement. In March 2000 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it would provide 'aid' for the 'upliftment of the nomadic Raute tribe' (Kathmandu Post, 27 Mar. 2000). Even though Raute have refused to take vaccinations and explained that they do not 'stick to one place', the WHO planned to settle Raute in one of the southerly regions of Nepal and provide them with canvas tents, food rations, and polio vaccinations. The WHO's goal is to eradicate polio throughout the world by the year 2003 and, in order to accomplish this, apparently WHO officials in Nepal believe that they would have to settle the Raute forcibly before vaccinating them.16 Whether Raute employ verbal art as impression management, deception, or a bold defence, they recognize their inability to live as sedentary agricul- turalists. By settling into villages, Raute would not be able to harvest enough wood (ash, rhododendron, and other softwoods), hunt enough langur and macaque, or collect enough wild yams and other forest edibles. If forcibly settled, within less than a year Raute would barter their woodenwares to every possible nearby Nepali household, and their market would be 'saturated'. Their only option would be to join the poorest, most exploited underclass of Nepali society, becoming bonded labourers (N. kamaiya). Instead, they prefer to occupy the forests (K. manam), because, according to the elder Indra, 'manam is where God's family lives'. 252</page><page sequence="21">JANA FORTIER NOTES Earlier drafts of this article benefited from collegial comments during guest lectures at Clarkson University in March 2000 and Dartmouth College in January 2001.

These genres, ging and marena, may be glossed respectively as 'long ago stories' and 'stories about recent things'. 2For comparison of proverbs regionally, see Raheja and Grodzins Gold (1994: xi, 78, 79, 86, 92, 121-4) and Wilce (1998: 41, 203, 224). For dictionaries of Nepali proverbs, see Karma (1996); Lall (1994); Sarma (2000). 3Turner's Nepali dictionary defines ukhan as a 'story, riddle, proverb, parable' (Turner 1965: 44). 4An exception is found in Jacobson (1999). The villagers of Charigaun, a mixed Tamang/Sherpa/Caste Nepali village in Dolakha District of northern Nepal, use the term ukhan to label what most Nepalis would call katha, or stories. 5In this translation, bydpdr literally means 'business' but I translate it as 'good price' in order to rhyme with 'rice'. 6Previously I conducted research in Jajarkot District in 1986-87, 1989-90, and 1993 with the surrounding population of Nepali agriculturalists (Fortier 1993; 1995). 7While it can be used in a politically neutral, complimentary, or derogatory sense, the term jahgali is used here in a neutral sense. Matisoff gives the following ethnonymic variants for 'Raute': 'Jangali [paleo] is a variant spelling of Janggali, Jangyali ("men of the forest"); Banmanus [paleo] ("men of the forest"); Ban-Raja [paleo] ("kings of the forest"); Ban-Rawat [paleo]; Rautiya [paleo]; Rawat [paleo]. Cf. Raji [? Rawat Hindu social caste]' (Matisoff 1995: 84). Other reports concerning Raute are based on short meetings and interviews by news reporters. For example, see Bista (1978); Nepali-Yatri (1983);Wagle (1997). 9An exception to the cross-cousin rule is found among the Tibeto-Burman Magar, whose preference for mother's sister's daughter remains popular despite its prohibition in Indo- Nepalese kinship marriage patterns. i?In Fortier 2000, I present another origin story, which tells how 'one day monkeys were born as humans' and became the two clans of the Raute. As far as I am aware, this story is not told to villagers. For a third origin story, in which Raute are the descendants of a Khas Malla leader named Bahati, see Nepali-Yatri (1983). For an origin story claiming royal ances- try among the Raji, see Negi (1982: 154). In general, similar origin stories of royal ancestry are recorded for other hunter-gatherer groups in South Asia such as the Kusunda (Reinhard 1968) and Birhor (Crooke 1890: 180). "The flexibility of Riute rhyming can be seen in the recitation of a similar proverb by Indra in which he inserted the Brahman caste instead of women into the couplet: 'yo roti uparko sir chdina/Bdhun banda updrko jat chaina [Roti bread has no upper part, and no caste is above Brahman]'. Mary Cameron also repeats a similar proverb for villagers of Bhajang District: 'Birds have no house, and women have no belief' (1998: 164, no Nepali version given). Although the metaphor of birds differs from that of bread, the metaphoric similarities are apparent. 12By 'village girl', the conversation refers to a Riji girl whose mother said that her family was just like the nomadic Raute until they settled down into a village in Dhaduldura District. Thus, this 'village girl' was being considered as a possible marriage partner. 253</page><page sequence="22">JANA FORTIER l Raute dshik, blessings, are performed for the prosperity of a villager who acquires Raute wooden bowls or boxes. Ashik are not the subject of this essay but they also connote a sense of authority, sacredness, and purity attaching to Raute performers, just as a Brahman priest receives an aura of sanctity by performing sacred rituals. Bird-David states a similar case of a hunter-gather group performing blessings on the local village populations (Bird-David 1996). "Indra performed and discussed sixteen ukhan during this session. "King Prithivi Narayan Shaha (c.1770 AD) supposedly said that 'Nepal is like a flower between two stones'; during fieldwork I have also heard the saying that 'Nepal is like a yam between two stones'. ('So far as I can judge, the logistics of giving the oral polio vaccine do not seem to necessitate forced settlement. Happily for the Raute, it appears that they are continuing to follow their 'traditional' migratory route rather than allowing themselves to be forcibly settled. REFERENCES Allen, N.J. 1975.

L'art de tromper: les performances verbales des Raiutes du Nepal Resume Les Rautes, une petite population de chasseurs-cueilleurs de langue tibeto-birmane, esquiv- ent la communication interculturelle avec les agriculteurs de langue nepali qui les entourent, 256</page><page sequence="25">JANA FORTIER 257 sauf pendant les sessions de troc. Au cours de ces interactions interculturelles, les Rautes charment souvent leurs partenaires commerciaux en utilisant l'art verbal nepali, y compris la recitation de vers, de chants et de benedictions. Je suggere dans cet article que la represen- tation de l'art verbal qu'offrent les Rautes sert a detourner l'attention des differences radi- cales de leur mode de vie et a resister aux courants hegemoniques d'hindouisation. L'article fait une critique detaillee de la performance orale des Rautes comme strategie de discours indirect, en attirant l'attention sur le contexte et la composition des proverbes rimes comme moyens de camoufler les pratiques culturelles veritables des Rautes.
