WHITTAKER Philosophy of Religion 20:1 7-30 (1986) ©Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht - Printed in the Netherlands Department of Philosophy , Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803-3901 Religious assertions about transcendent realities, particularly Christian assertions about these things, possess a peculiar logical feature - a feature which philosophers of religion would do well to dwell on as they seek to clarify the nature of dogmatic claims. The feature that I have in mind is this: claims about the nature of God, the relation among the persons of the Trinity, the character of the afterlife, the "sonship" of Christ, the reasons for evil in the world, and so forth, all rest on mysteries. The most important claims of the faith float, as it were, over a sea of unknowns which cannot be plumbed by human understanding. Yet at the same time that theologians admit the sea of mystery lying beneath religious claims, they expect their claims to be believed - believed in spite of the fact that the objects of these claims are drowned in obscurity. The curiousness of this situa- tion should not be passed over lightly. How can one be asked to believe state- ments made about things which cannot be understood? How can "transcendent" things be described and yet shrouded in mystery? The traditional answer is that religious claims about divine realities are anal- ogically true of their objects. That is to say, such claims are not literally true but only figuratively or metaphorically suited to the realities to which they point. They give what is supposedly the best possible description of their objects, but at the same time this description falls short of a completely adequate account. The doctrine of analogy (or a theory of metaphorical language) holds these two aspects of belief together: the claim to have given the best possible description and the claim to have failed to give an account that is descriptively adequate. This general view, whether it employs the notion of analogical predication or the no- tion of metaphorical description, still presumes knowledge of the objects being described. For one must know (1) that there are such realities to be described, and (2) that certain descriptions are more appropriate to them than other descrip- tions. One must know enough about them, in other words, to tell that certain descriptions are inadequate. He must be able to contrast a. knowledge of a tran- scendent object in itself with the way in which this object is represented in human discourse. That is what enables one to say that the dogmatic description of this object is only partially or analogically true. The only problem is that the knowl-</page><page sequence="2">18 edge which one must have to recognize the figurative nature of religious language conflicts with the claim that the objects of this language are impenetrable myste- ries. I want to suggest a quite different account.1 My view is that religious claims - or to be more exact, the more basic claims of a religion - are purpose claims. They are claims which frame conceptions of the cosmos so that the meaning or the worth, the point or the purpose, of the lives that we live can be drawn into focus. If they are interpreted in isolation from the contexts in which they function as teleological principles, they are inevitably misunderstood. If their role in framing judgments of purpose is missed, so too is their point.2 To avoid this kind of mis- understanding, I think that we should say that most religious claims are claims, not about transcendental objects or supernatural realities but about purposes. The point of such claims is to undergird teleological orders of judgment wherein concep- tions of life's worth, the prospect of happiness, the world's raison d'etre, and the uncertain fate that surrounds us can be submitted to thought and judged. They bear teleological implications not as consequences of their metaphysical truth but as part of their very meaning. They are purpose claims through and through, and as such, they need to be philosophically re-understood. This means that religious assertions should not be construed as assertions whose point it is to describe a hidden world of supernatural objects. Though they appear to describe such a world, they have a more important function, a function which passes from view whenever they are interpreted as claims whose primary intent is to depict metaphysical realities. The metaphysical aspect which they appear to have is incidental to their sense. None of this means, however, that religious assertions are not truth claims. It means only that if any religious assertions are true, they are true of life's purposes. The domain in which they might be true, in other words, is the domain of teleologi- cal judgment, not the domain of metaphysical explanation. Just as moral claims can be true without being claims to empirical fact, or to anything comparable to empirical fact, religious claims can be true without being claims to supernatural, quasi- empirical, fact. This, then, is the view, stated baldly and in a nutshell, that I want to clarify. The objections that one is apt to urge against it, I think, stem from misunder- standings; and these misunderstandings will have to be pared away to enable my thesis to exert its appeal. Even leaving this idea unclear, though, one ought to be able to see how in general it anticipates a novel account of the idea that religious claims describe mysteries. Why is it that the whole tissue of religion seems to float on the surface of metaphysical mysteries? It is because the meaning of religious assertions cannot finally be clarified by specifying the properties of objects to which they supposedly refer. One's questions about the precise nature of the transcendent objects to which religious claims refer cannot be answered, not be- cause there are such objects which nevertheless exceed our cognitive grasp, but because the point of religious assertions must be understood in terms of the role which they play as purposive principles. They are working beliefs, and they acquire</page><page sequence="3">19 their point owing to the job that they do, not to the mysterious referents which they seem to have. Thus, the attempt to explain the meaning of a religious claim in terms of the properties of its referent must come to an end; it must be halted with reminders about the mysteriousness of these objects, simply because the point which religious assertions bear as teleological principles cannot be packed into the properties of a hypothetical entity. The enquiry which proceeds on the assumption that religious claims derive their meaning by depicting objects in an unseen state of affairs starts from a mistake; and the claim that these objects are mysterious is, in effect, a way of saying this. One can go only so far on that assumption, for the objects are "mysterious," meaning that the effort to state the exact meaning of religious claims must be launched on new assumptions if it is to succeed. The sug- gestion that religious assertions are teleological principles offers the new assump- tion that is needed. To explain in detail what I mean by this suggestion, I would like to anticipate some questions and possible objections. What exactly is meant by "purpose claims" or "teleological judgments"? We often speak of the purpose of one thing or another without invoking any religious perspective. Obviously, some distinction must be drawn between the kind of judg- ment which we make when we say, for example, that Jeffrey is saving money for the purpose of buying a new car, and the kind of judgment which we make when we say that the purpose of human existence is to glorify God. The purpose claims that are connected with religion are like this latter claim. They portray the purposes of things from the highest vantage point, from a cosmic perspective, so that it makes no sense to advance inquiry to another level and to ask about purposes from this higher point of view. That is why it makes no sense to ask what the purpose of God's existence is, for God and his purposes are the terms in which everything else is assigned its reason for being. Such a cosmic view of purpose is ultimate', it cannot be superceded, while all lesser judgments of purpose can be.3 Because such cosmic perspectives of purpose are ultimate, virtually everything comes within the range of their evaluation. What is the point of the moral life? Why is there evil in the natural world? Why do people suffer unfairly? Not all of these questions can be answered in a specific way, but one gets a general idea of the way in which they might be answered by thinking about them in terms of a religious outlook. By relying on the fundamental claims of a religion one commits himself to believing that there are answers in principle, even if one cannot spell these answers out in detail. Finding these answers is a matter of discovering pur- pose, a reason for being, and an absolute sense of worth in one's life; and the tele- ological principles of a religion provide a general direction in which to look for them. "Teleological" may not be the best word to use; it sounds too academic and its meaning is too variable. But as long as this term is understood broadly enough to include every kind of purposive evaluation, and as long as it is under- stood narrowly enough to include only ultimate judgments of purpose, it will have to suffice. Religious beliefs are, for the most part, teleological principles.</page><page sequence="4">20 What do beliefs about the world's purpose have to do with a person's longing for happiness? One might think that conceptions one has about the world's pur- pose and the notions one has about one's own purpose are two separate things. But they are not. One struggles to gain some notion of cosmic purposes so that one might live with the confidence that the overall direction of one's own life accords with the rhyme and reason of the universe. One wants to feel that the ends to which one directs his life are called for, that they are ingredient in the nature of things, and that they are not arbitrary choices which reflect only sub- jective whims. A religion, or any comparable system of teleological judgment, satisfies this need to correlate one's purposes with a sense of what really matters in life. So these two kinds of evaluation, judging the world's purpose and judging one's own are intimately related. One cannot assess one's final goals with any confidence without at the same time committing oneself to views about what makes life in general worthwhile. The questions that make us fundamentally un- happy are, after all, questions about our own reason for being; and the viewpoints which speak to this spiritual anxiety promise the wisdom of knowing what a worthwhile life is. Are religions the only systems of thought which provide such purposive out- looks, or which offer wisdom of this sort? No, they are not. But the fact that some secular ways of construing life also enable cosmic judgments of purpose to be made (communism, scientism, humanism, spiritualism, etc.) explains why these theories of life are often described as quasi-religions. For the fact that religions offer teleological perspectives on life is their most characteristic feature, but other "isms" do the same, No doubt religions have additional features - clerical organi- zations, provisions for worship, sacred placed and times, traditional lore, etc.; and these define "religion" in its ordinary, open-textured, use. But the fact that re- ligious beliefs portray life in purposive ways is surely one of their more essential features, and I am more concerned about this fact than I am about trying to tighten the definition of "religion" so that we may know what to say about borderline cases. Are all religious beliefs teleological principles? "No"; the language of religion is notoriously complex. It includes historical narratives, moral assertions, meta- physical speculations (often by mistake, I think), poetry, proverbial wisdom, etiological myths, and other types of discourse. Much of this other discourse, how- ever, reflects the beliefs which underwrite judgments of purpose; and so I think that the teleological principles of a religion are its beliefs par excellence. What about religions in which time is cyclically conceived, or in which history does not culminate in a final goal? Are they teleological? As long as the world is understood in a way which suggests that a certain way of life is appropriate, the particular way in which time is conceived does not matter. The resultant outlook is still teleological. Buddhism, for example, promises the wisdom which consists of</page><page sequence="5">21 knowing the true concerns, the unselfish concerns, that undergird a well-spent life. Thus, a Buddhist who thinks and lives in accordance with his religious outlook must feel that he is living a well-spent life and that he is doing the most that he can to minimize the time spent in cyclic existence. His life is governed by the idea that a higher state of existence beckons beyond karmic existence, and this is true whether or not he imagines that time leads to a final consummation. This higher existenece, nirvana, gives the Buddhist's life a goal; and the value of earthly atti- tudes and practices in judged according to the value of these things as paths to nirvana. So Buddhist teachings still have a teleological import, even though time, for the Buddhist, does not advance toward a divinely appointed end. In the traditional Judeo- Christian view, life has a purpose because God gave it a purpose. Thus, one must first believe in the existence of God before there can be any question of God-given purposes. How does your view differ from this con- ception? This question broaches the most difficult and the most controversial parts of the view which I am proposing, and I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not believe that the question of God's existence, or of the existence of any super- natural beings, is in any way prior to questions about the world's purpose, the meaning of our fate, the significance of our suffering, or any of the other ques- tions which I have described as "teleological." This means that the question of God's existence, at least as a religious claim, cannot be discussed without also discussing those factors which lead one to believe that one's efforts to live a godly life come as near as possible to the true life, the one which is appropriate to us all. Our reasons for believing in God are the same, ultimately, as our reasons for order- ing our lives in conformity with "godly" hopes and aspirations. Believing in God means thinking about one's own life in religious categories; it means construing one's life as graced by a higher calling; it means supplanting one's ordinary hopes with an overarching passion that qualifies all worldly desires. So it is impossible in thought as well as in practice to distill the metaphysical essence of the religious belief in God, as if this "essence" were distinguishable from the subsequent impli- cations of purpose which follow from it. Who attempts such a distinction? The philosophers who debate theism on meta- physical grounds usually treat the issue of God's existence in isolation from the teleological point of believing in God. The traditional metaphysical proofs for the existence of God, with the possible exception of the argument from design, ground the belief in God in evidence which has little to do with human beings' concerns over the purpose of their lives. Is there a first cause, an efficient cause, for the being of the world? Is the idea of God such that the very understanding of this idea commits one to the existence of God? Does the order of the natural world presuppose an intelligent orderer? To base one's belief in God on affirmative answers to these questions is to ground it outside of a teleological system of judg- ment. It is to affirm a belief which appears to be religious, being formulated with the same words as the religious belief in God, but which does not play the same role as the religious belief. It is to affirm a belief which religiously is pointless, being stripped of its normal role as a teleological principle.</page><page sequence="6">22 Even if one grants that questions about God or about supernatural causes are inseparable from questions pertaining to purpose, does not one still require the existence of God or of gods to be the source of purpose? How can there be cos- mic purposes without transcendent beings who have these purposes? I know that my answer to this question will be controversial, but I can see no reason why inti- mations of higher purpose have to be understood as the result of a higher being's planning or intention. Religiously, the ways in which God is described serve to articulate the teleological import of religious assertions. The conceptual formula- tion of these beliefs specifies their role in regulative judgments of purpose, bringing out particular implications and suggesting what it would mean to abide by these teachings. The whole conceptual apparatus exists solely to detail these purposes. To clarify a bit, suppose that we consider ordinary judgments of purpose. When- ever we are discussing the purposes of things - e.g., the purpose of a certain tool or of a certain social institution - our remarks have implicit reference to the pur- poses of human beings. This tool is useful because we want to do this job, or this social institution is meaningful because we need such a structured existence, and so on. Ultimately, it is because we have the needs that we do that we assign pur- poses to things; our needs give things their purpose. We extend this kind of think- ing into the animal kingdom when we say that a certain anatomical appendage is useful because it facilitates the survival of the species. But the fact remains that purposes are understood from the point of view of beings that have them. Thus, it is natural to express our convictions about cosmic purposes as if they were pur- poses which belonged to cosmic agents. This way of speaking retains the connec- tion between purposes and people which we normally assume. Such thoughts - about purposes as the purposes of supernatural agents - are almost unavoidable, almost unavoidable because there are certain exceptions. Some types of Buddhism deny the existence of transcendent entities, but these schools of thought clearly retain the sense that a selfless life is the highest pos- sible and that this life represents man's true end. Karmic rebirth ought to be es- caped, and nirvana should be one's goal. Why? - because cosmically these pur- poses are written into the nature of things. The law of karma just is. Nirvana just is. And people have aspirations which can only be fulfilled by attaining nirvana. To those of us in the west these notions are hard to understand because we are so used to associating convictions about the ultimate purposes of things with the existence of transcendent beings. But this is not the case in Buddhism, at least in sophisticated Buddhism. The gods of Buddhism are allowed in the thinking of ordinary people so that simple believers can orient themselves toward a noble life, yet as the believer approaches that life, the gods disappear as essential aspects of faith. The supernatural fades, so to speak, but not the teleological vision which it supports. Judeo-Christian religion may be more like this kind of Buddhism than it seems. In the language of worship, prayer, and personal piety, anthropomorphic descrip- tions of God are freely employed; but in the language of theology these anthro- pomorphic images are taken with a grain of salt. At best, they have only a meta-</page><page sequence="7">23 phorical truth. Assuming that the theologians are right about this, and Christian discourse is metaphorical, why is such language so widely tolerated? One answer is that the formation of a Christian character requires a range of emotions and passions which are most easily shaped under the influence of a vivid picture of what life is all about. Gratitude, for example, is supposed to be an emotion which Chris- tians are to feel for the right to count themselves forgiven, to affirm themselves, and to hope anew for that consummate peace which passes all understanding. But gratitude is an emotion which ordinarily takes an object; one who is grateful is always grateful to someone for something. This is part of the common usage of the word; it belongs to the "grammar" of gratitude. Therefore, to fit one's sense of life as a whole to the ordinary grammar of this concept, the Christian believes that he has received a gift from a giver •; his right to affirm himself despite his sin- fulness is conveyed to him by the loving acceptance of God. The picture of a human-like God loving him, blessing him, forgiving him, and accepting him inspires the believer to respond with gladness and gratitude. It facilitates the upsurge of these emotions within him, and does so because it makes his situation with respect to his life as a whole comparable to familiar occasions for gratitude. But must gratitude always be tied to a giver? Consider insomniacs and the prob- lem of going to sleep. On the one hand, one knows that he cannot make himself go to sleep; the more one tries to put himself to sleep, the worse the problem be- comes. Thus, when sleep finally comes, such a person might regard it as a gift, something that he did not achieve by his own efforts. Perhaps he gives thanks to the god of sleep who gives him sleep as a gift. How else could it be; if he did not make himself fall asleep by trying, then his falling asleep must have been the gift of another power. But this isn't the case; sleep is not a gift of a hidden power. Nor must the grace whereby we become reconciled to ourselves be the gift of an external power. True, we cannot forgive ourselves, just as one cannot put himself to sleep by trying, but this does not imply that our "forgiveness" must have its origin in another power. One can be grateful for the gift of forgiveness in the same way that one can be grateful for the gift of sleep. Life, which sends us sleep when we need it, also allows us to be ourselves, to count ourselves forgiven, even though we know that we do not - and cannot - forgive ourselves.4 In Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, though, do not people believe that an actual God exists, a real entity, who grounds all talk of ultimate purpose? People do believe this; but the question is, what is lost if this belief is analyzed as a tele- ological principle? What is lost, in other words, if the mystery that is referred to by the word "God" is known only insofar as people know how to live in the face of this mystery? If one's metaphorical descriptions of God are said to give us wis- dom in knowing what to value and what to hope for, what to cherish and what to leave aside, how is the belief impoverished on this view? Obviously, the metaphysical aspect of the belief in God vanishes, but it is by no means clear that this loss makes any essential difference. One who holds the view which I am suggesting can no longer take seriously certain pictures of God,</page><page sequence="8">24 but who wants to say that the content of the belief in God consists in various images of God which we have in our minds? C.S. Lewis uses us the example of a small child who knows that certain pills are poisonous but who imagines this to be the result of the pills containing "horrid red things".5 The pills, of course, did not contain the horrid little red things, and so the particular image that the child had of poison was erroneous. But the child still knew that it was very danger- ous to eat the pills and that grave consequences would await those who did. Thus, the child had what one might call a practical knowledge despite his mistaken image of poison. Religious believers are like the child in this example (more like it, in fact, than Lewis would have admitted). For the mystery of God is a mystery, and believers do not need to deny the childlike humility which lets this mystery remain a mystery. The descriptions of God as personal, as a being, as loving, as good - these are all no better than metaphors for something that remains utterly un- known. But at the same time that these descriptions are literally erroneous, they enable believers to hang onto a conception of life which may be just as true as the child's warnings about the poison. Beliefs about God, articulated in anthropo- morphic language and held to be metaphorically true of a transcendent object, are the girding principles of a purposive conception of life that promises wisdom in knowing the ultimate ends of existence, not knowledge of a supernatural order. But if there are no objects for religious beliefs to be true of, how can they be true at all? Here an analogy might help. Scientists regularly speak of the "laws of nature," meaning observed and predictable regularities found in various parts of the natural world. In our social experience, however, all laws are made by human lawmakers. Thus, one can understand the attitude of those philosophers who thought that the laws of nature must have been ordained by a law-giver, God. But this is hardly necessary. Many scientists believe in natural laws without attributing them to a law-giver. These laws simply are. They are given with the world itself. I am suggesting that there may be, in effect, laws of purpose which can be thought of in the same way as laws of nature. It is no more necessary to imagine these laws as the dictates of a supernatural agent than it is to imagine natural laws as enact- ments of the gods. But must not the claim that nature is lawlike have a referent to bear any sense? Isn't the term "God" a referring term? Certainly the term "God" looks like a refer- ring term, and so we assume that there must be some thing to which it refers. This assumption accounts in large part for the feeling that God must be an object of some kind, however mysterious. Yet the theory of language which states that every referring term must refer to a physical or quasi-physical object - to a thing is dubious at best. What are the objects referred to by moral terms, "goodness," "evil," "obligation," and so on? And what are the objects referred to by state- ments about the future? We can invent metaphysical objects for these terms to refer to; but these made-up "objects" simply represent the effort to build the grammar of these terms into object -language, just as Plato had to build the grammar of various concepts into his forms. Similarly, we can invent an "object" for the</page><page sequence="9">25 term "God" to refer to, but this "object" can have none of the properties of other objects; e.g., it cannot have a spatial or temporal location, it must be omnipresent but present in some places more than in others, it must be eternal, etc. Here one has to define this "object" in such a way that reference to it will have the same implications as the relevant beliefs about God. But this means that one must al- ready know the grammar of the term "God" before trying to define a referent for it. The referent is only an attempt to capture a deeper understanding of religious language which is already ingredient in its use. It therefore seems preferable to say, not that "God" refers to an extraordinary object, whose properties are difficult to define and ultimately mysterious, but that the term does not refer to an object at all. The theory that the word "God" must refer to an entity of some kind in order to have a meaning is based on a naive conception of the way language works. In short, claims about purposes can be true, even when there are no beings who ordain these purposes, no "objects" for these purpose claims to be true of, and no states of affairs from which implications of purpose are derived. Can Christian teachings, then, be translated out of the language of the super- natural and into a pure language of purpose, or into a language which makes no reference to supernatural beings? I don't think that such translations are possible. Some of the vividness or the effectiveness of religious claims - the ease with which they lend themselves to being applied in the struggle to make sense out of life - would be lost if one attempted to do this. The reference to supernatural beings makes the subtle implications of purpose claims clear by displaying these implica- tions in terms of interpersonal relations; e.g., in terms of human beings and their relation to another purposeful agent, God. That is why anthropomorphic language about God is unavoidable ; the anthropomorphic descriptions of God help us to see the implications which beliefs about God bear for our lives. Does your view differ in any important respect from the account of religious belief offered by R.B. Braithwaite?6 Braithwaite offered an explanation of the importance of religious claims despite their lack of cognitive significance. For him, basic religious claims express intentions to adhere to moral ways of life; and these intentions are made easier to pursue because of the various stories associated with religions (historical assertions, legends, parables, myths, etc.). But the basic claims are not truth claims, and the truth or falsity of some of the associated stories is incidental to the psychological aid they provide in inspiring the practice of the believer. Since I believe that religious beliefs, as purpose claims, can be true, my view differs fundamentally from any such theory. The difference comes from the fact that Braithwaite adhered to a positivistic notion of truth claims, whereas I do not. In my view, truth claims may be defined as non-arbitrary judgments. This requires explanation, of course - more explana- tion than I can give here. But Braithwaite alluded to rational factors which might</page><page sequence="10">26 make the decision to follow a certain way of life something other than an arbitrary choice.7 I will have something to say about such factors below; but for now, let me say simply that the same considerations which govern moral and teleological judg- ments also make them "objective," and to that extent, make them truth claims. According to this expanded way of regarding truth claims, there is no necessary connection between empirical claims and truth claims. Nor is there any connec- tion between truth claims and given (valueless) states of affairs in a non- empirical realm. For an assertion to be a genuine truth claim, all that is required is it be subject to some means of judgment, and the capacitating effect of principles quali- fies as such a means. Isn yt there a difference between believing that something is true and believing that one will have his purposes fulfilled if he adheres to the practical implications of religious claims? Yes, there is; but I am not saying that religious beliefs are means to independently established ends. Such a view would reduce religious claims to a menial status, not unlike that of Braithwaite's "stories." In that case the truth or falsity of religious claims would not matter; only their function as the means to an extra-linguistic end would matter. Again, however, I am not suggesting such a view. Instead, religious beliefs govern the determination of one's ultimate ends. They determine whether one lives for wealth, pleasure, mere survival, service, love, self- lessness, or the glory of God. And they do this because the ultimate purposes which they assert affects the individual's conception of his true happiness or ulti- mate well-being. One could even say that religions define true happiness. This is an oversimplification, no doubt; but at least it indicates that religious conceptions determine our most basic evaluative categories, the ones which supply us with our conception of life's goals. Why not simply admit that religious claims make assertions about supernatural beings, since the force which they bear as teleological claims would be lost if they were not figuratively expressed? Whether one says that religious believers have a partial knowledge of transcendent beings which exceed their grasp, or says that believers have a different kind of knowledge, not a metaphysical knowledge but a working practical wisdom, may not seem to make much difference. And for most purposes, I don't suppose that it does make much difference. These two different ways of interpreting the epistemological humility of believers leave the practical implications of faith unchanged. Those who believe that a metaphysical God exists and those who believe that the God idea conveys a concrete image of true purpose will extend the same reverent attitude to the works of "creation." Both will feel that their lives are undergirded with purpose, even when this purpose escapes their grasp; and both will feel grateful for the life that they have. Nevertheless, there is a reason for choosing to describe religious knowledge as practical wisdom; and it concerns the possible justification of religious claims. When the grounds of religious claims are in doubt, then one must consider the kind of claims which need to be defended. If they are at bottom metaphysical</page><page sequence="11">27 claims, one will need evidence from natural theology to ground them - evidence of design in nature, speculative arguments, signs of miracles, etc. But if they repre- sent teleological wisdom of a practical sort, then one will need evidence of another order. Then the search for justification will have to be keyed to those factors which move us to reflect on our fulfillment and its relation to life's higher meaning. I believe that the arguments from natural theology are largely inappropriate as apologetic reasons for belief. They have rightly been criticized by philosophers, whereas the second kind of argument has scarcely been made by philosophers. Shifting the perspective in which religious belief is generally understood, there- fore, is a way of shifting^the burden of justification to this other arena, in which practical wisdom has its own rationale. One would like to know, of course, what this rationale is; but it is impossible here to give the matter of justification the attention that it deserves. All that I can do is to to suggest an outline of some of the ways in which one might try to defend a teleological conception of life. Because religious principles underwrite a teleological dimension in one's thinking, they need to be supported by reasons which make us think that such a dimension is called for. The principles themselves cannot be derived, either from more primitive certainties of a teleological sort or from judgments belonging to another area of thinking. Their justification, there- fore, must come from those considerations which lead one to accept the whole system in which they function. This kind of "justification" is quite different than the justification of individual claims on independent evidential grounds. Instead of grounding religious claims in prior evidence, it consists more of dismantling one's reasons for thinking that such grounds are needed. As one feels more and more capacitated by religious conceptions, he is less and less tempted to regard his be- liefs as hypotheses in need of a foundation. But why would anyone think that such ultimate purposive outlooks are neces- sary? Why bother with them at all? The answer is that they promise understanding. The interpretation which they provide is not simply an optional overlay in one's reading of the world, but is a perspective which furnishes real insight, and the sign that teleological interpretation increases one's understanding is the capacity which comes from adhering to religious principles in one's thinking. Such a capacity concerns problems of thought about the meaning of life; and it concerns prob- lems about becoming a self, acquiring a certain order and constancy in one's moral and emotional life, and developing a transparency or honesty in one's self-under- standing. Here especially the capacities that come with teleological wisdom about life are most recognizable. Those that have the wisdom to manage these issues are people of strong character, and they make a striking impression on us. Such factors as the impact of exemplary people cannot be turned into proofs for religious principles, at least not without assuming a lot of other subsidiary premises; but neither are they irrelevant. They don't provide sharp criteria for choosing among competing religious and quasi-religious conceptions of life, but spiritual beliefs are not selected from a pool of neutral candidates, all of which have the same relation to the believer. One commits himself to "living options,"</page><page sequence="12">28 as William James said; and the same factors which bring such options to life also lead to belief, except where intellectual scruples (e.g., questions about consistency) cause a person to doubt.8 In trying to describe these enlivening factors I feel as Wittgenstein did in trying to dissolve philosophical muddles - that I have only clumsy fingers to use on a torn spider's web. Yet the way in which religious teach- ings help to articulate needs which we feel in ourselves, the influence of saintly people, the nobility of a teleological outlook, the form which beliefs provide for our formless and accidental emotional lives - these are all inspirational factors, and they all lead in the direction of belief. They make religious belief appropriate to our lives, and to that extent, they make a commitment to religious principles reasonable. Again, I do not pretend that considerations like these could be marshalled as a proof for a religious outlook. They do not even function as evidence for the verifi- cation of religious hypotheses. But they fit the situation in which we find our- selves, and they discipline that reflection in which we seek the wisdom to know how to live. Logically as well as psychologically, they lie close to people's actual practice in forming a teleological view of life, and I do not think that their im- portance should be minimized. So if a metaphysical justification is not to be expected for religious principles, then it is entirely appropriate to attend to these other factors, and to similar ones which I did not have the foresight to mention. Metaphysical hypotheses are not at stake in matters of faith, not on the surface of religious discourse nor at the bottom of religious belief. Instead, religious belief is through and through a question of practical wisdom, of working principles, and of teleological truths by which to live. In sum, this metaphysically modest view has its advantages. It makes clear the fact that a religion is not a philosophy, and that a religious outlook on life is not to be judged as if it were a metaphysical system. If this were otherwise - if reli- gions were fundamentally metaphysical systems - then clever people who have an aptitude for philosophy would clearly be in a better position to make judg- ments about the metaphysical facts which underlie a teleological system of judg- ment. They might even know what others merely believe, or accept on faith. Religious knowing, however, differs from the knowledge of the learned man; and being philosophically astute is not an important advantage in acquiring the wis- dom of faith. That is because faith's wisdom is practical understanding, less depen- dent on intellectual advantages and more dependent on commonly shared difficul- ties of becoming a self in an apparently senseless world. Then, too, there is a technical advantage to the view that religious beliefs are purpose claims. Interpreted metaphysically, religious beliefs face the threat of the cognitivity challenge: how can claims about objects in an invisible, indetectible, realm really be truth claims? How can such claims asserts truths if there is no way in principle to confirm or to disconfirm them, or if there is not even any relevant evidence to be furnished? Admittedly, the issue of cognitivity has waned recently owing to the difficulties of formulating an unproblematic criterion of cognitive</page><page sequence="13">29 significance. Yet the effects of the debate over the status of religious claims have lingered; and many, including perhaps the majority of professional philosophers, are skeptical about the cognitive status of religious beliefs. Of course, the view that religious claims function as teleological principles faces the same difficulty; how can purpose claims be truth claims? Yet this view, as I understand it, points in the direction of a solution. For religious assertions have the same difficulty with their logical status as moral claims have - but they also have the same possi- bilities. I.e., if moral claims can be truth claims about obligations, then religious beliefs can be truth claims about purposes. This obviously means expanding the criterion by which truth claims are defined, so that it no longer applies only to empirical areas of discourse and becomes a purely formal notion. But this may be the way in which truth claims should be understood, and the view that I am pro- posing suggests as much. Finally, my reasons for preferring to think of religious beliefs as the corner- stones of purposive conceptions may be largely personal. For this view relieves me of the necessity of defending what I regard as highly dubious propositions about supernatural reality. Yet in exchange for giving up the pretense to super- natural knowledge, this view returns the gift of a more secure claim to practical wisdom. Here it seems wise to be humble, to claim no more than one can dream of justifying, and to rest content with an outlook which enables one to find him- self in the midst of life's uncertainties. Is this so different than what believers have always done? Have they ever supposed that the realm of divine things could be known? I think not. They cling to the purposes implied in their beliefs, they form their lives in accordance with the vision of a worthwhile existence, and they yield their metaphysical pictures in trust to the mystery that no one can ever fathom. NOTES 1. The view which follows is an elaboration of suggestions made in my book, Matters of Faith and Matters of Principle: Religious Truth Claims and Their Logic (San Antonio: Trinity University Press, 1981). John Post holds a similar view, indicated in "God is not the Value of a Variable," an unpublished paper given at the meeting of the Society for Philosophy of Religion, Louisville, 1986. 2. John H.

One can ask, for example, why Jeffrey needs a new care (to take convenient vacations), what purpose these vacations serve (to make him more relaxed), why he wants a re- laxed life (to live longer), and so on. But again, ultimate judgments of purpose cannot be superceded in this way. 4. A similar account can be given for other Christian doctrines that seem to presume a two- sided relationship; e.g., prayer. Assuming that the absence of a prayed-for result is not to be taken as negative evidence about the existence of God, one can say that prayer is an attempt to maintain an interpretation of all events as the will of God. One not only asks for what he wants but also prays that God's will be done, and he prepares himself to see whatever happens as the will of God. Is this not an attempt to sustain a teleologi- cal conception of events, to believe that they are explicable in principle, even though</page><page sequence="14">30 one does not know how to explain them in fact? If so, then prayer's interpretation does not require the existence of a metaphysical God. 5. C.S. Lewis .Miracles (New York: Macmillan, 1947), p. 10. 6. R.B.
