<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IMAGE OF THE THRESHOLD IN THE POETRY OF SAINT-JOHN PERSE A threshold is something sacred. Porphyry There seems little need to speak at length about the importance of the threshold in any community, however primitive or sophisticated. We recognize in everyday life the particular ambivalence of its nature, providing both a point of separation from the outside world which lies beyond our possession and immediate control and, at the same time, a means of access to that world. Alternatively, looking from the outside, respect is shown for the private lares and penates, and so polite custom requires a visitor to request access by some form of greeting or indication of his presence. The special attributes of the threshold have given rise at different times to different rituals. The Old Testament provides a number of examples, many of them violent, but others simply indicating the respect shown to the threshold: the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon to this day. (I Samuel, v, 4-5) The violence done to this pagan god of the Philistines finds an echo in Perse's view of the sea, the primal untameable element which pervades his work: 'Mer de Baal et de Dagon - face premiere de nos songes' (Amers, Choeur, i). And the sea's constant lashing of the earth's shores indicates a cosmic equivalent to the image of the threshold recurring throughout Perse's poetry: the sea-shore itself. A more peaceable biblical reference is one instance of many that could be evoked of a ceremony taking place on the threshold: And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. (Ezekiel, XLVI, 2) Both tone and topic remind one strangely of Perse's writing in Amitie du Prince or Anabase. The poet's observation and reading have led him to see the significance of the threshold, and to restore the primitive meaning to some of today's empty mimes: carrying the bride over the threshold, 'first-footing' and the like. If one applies the following observation by Mircea Eliade not only to the threshold of a church but also, as he suggests, to any domestic threshold by virtue of the special nature of one's home, the paradoxical qualities peculiar to the threshold become clear: La porte qui s'ouvre vers l'interieur de 1'eglise marque une solution de continuite. Le seuil qui separe les deux espaces indique en meme temps la distance entre les deux modes d'etre, profane et religieux. Le seuil est a la fois la borne, la frontiere qui distingue et oppose deux mondes, et le lieu paradoxal ou ces mondes communiquent, ou peut s'effectuer le passage du monde profane au monde sacre. Une fonction rituelle analogue est devolue au seuil des habitations humaines, et c'est pourquoi il jouit d'une telle consideration. (Le Sacre et le Profane (I965), p. 24)</page><page sequence="2">The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse After listing a number of rites associated with the threshold, Eliade summarizes neatly the nature of the ambivalence: 'Le seuil, la porte montrent d'une facon immediate et concrete la solution de continuit6 de l'espace; d'ou leur grande importance religieuse, car ils sont tout ensemble les symboles et les vehicules du passage.' The poetic extensions which may be taken from the concrete facts are perhaps indicated by the attributes heaped on the Roman 'God of Gods', Janus. Starting as a sun-god, his position was gradually usurped by Jupiter, but he was left to open and close the day, holding its keys as well as those of heaven and of all doors and gates on earth. From there to being a god of all beginnings, all departures, is an easy step, and so Janus bifrons, looking both ways from any threshold with appropriate ambivalence, became also a god of wells, rivers, and harbours. No reminder is needed at this stage of Perse's use of this particular extension of the image. The god whose two faces are known essentially from a wealth of Roman coins, had as his symbol on the obverse side the same as Perse would have emblazoned on Cybele's gates or nailed to the Lovers' door, a ship: 'Aux portes closes des Amants clouez l'image du Navire!' (Amers, Strophe, Ix, 7). With the mention of one further, central word which characterizes two-headed Janus, namely uncertainty, the major aspects of Perse's use of the threshold image have been anticipated. As with other themes, this moves from the immediate and physical through highly-charged extensions to take on, finally, metaphysical associations while still remaining rooted in the concrete. From doorstep to sea-shore, and from sea-shore to the threshold of eternity in space and time, are natural and under- standable progressions. From the poems of the early I92os onwards the importance of the threshold is recognized. In the opening section of Anabase comes a clear cry: 'Au seuil des tentes toute gloire!' echoed later by: 'Et voici que ces Rois sont assis a ma porte.' And just as the young bdke's uncles had tethered their horses at the door of the family house in the Indies (recorded in Pour feter une enfance, vi), so now we hear of 'le guerrier licencie qui a plante sa lance sur son seuil pour attacher un singe . . . ' But the pointing of the image does not remain simply at this level of recognition of the threshold's importance, with both the Prince in Amitie du Prince and the old man in the Chanson du Presomptif sitting on the threshold, in shadow. Its breadth is hinted at not only in the phrase from Anabase, ix, used twice again in Vents, II, 2, 'au seuil d'un grand pays' but also more importantly in Anabase, vi: '- Ainsi parfois nos seuils presses d'un singulier destin et, sur les pas precipites du jour, de ce c6t du monde, le plus vaste, oi le pouvoir s'exile chaque soir, tout un veuvage de lauriers!' The singular fate treading on these thresholds is expressed here with a clarity which hindsight calls prophecy, linked as it is with the notion that each evening power goes into exile. The next published poem, Exil, links the image of the threshold inseparably with the idea of exile. Given the data of the image, it is hardly surprising that it receives its fullest expression when the diplomat is thrown from power, and the poet stands alone in a completely New World: Portes ouvertes sur les sables, portes ouvertes sur l'exil, Les cl6s aux gens du phare, et I'astre rou6 vif sur la pierre du seuil: Mon h6te, laissez-moi votre maison de verre dans les sables ... (Exil, I) The Roman tradition was to close the gates of the Temple of Janus in time of peace and open them in time of war. In I941, when Exil was written, with the 778</page><page sequence="3">ROGER LITTLE 779 Second World War in full devastating swing, it is quite appropriate that the lighthouse doors on Long Beach Island, New Jersey, should remain firmly open. Completely appropriate too is the intimate association through imagery of exile and the beach, indicated from the very beginning by the complete parallelism of the two octosyllables of the opening line bar the substitution of'les sables' by 'l'exil'. The lighthouse keys are with the keepers and the star, we are told, is broken on the wheel on the threshold stone. This multiple image has elicited a number of interpretations: Maurice Saillet (Saint-John Perse (I952), p. 84) attached it specifically to the immediate circumstances of war and saw only the Nazi swastika: 'L'ennemi est nomme de fa?on transparente au debut du poeme: "l'astre roue vif sur la pierre du seuil" designe non sans magnificence la croix gammee qui regne d'un bout a l'autre du pays.' Monique Parent adds a feasible extension, justifiably wary of a critic who claims to see the meaning of one of Perse's images 'de facon transparente': Je verrais plut6t dans cet astre supplicie et brise, d'abord l'image concrete d'une tache de soleil sur le seuil, car la vision du sang s'impose a nous a travers l'expression "rou6 vif", puis dans cette image, je trouverais le symbole de la gloire de France, peut-etre aussi celle du poete, d6truite, broyde. C'est finalement le signe de la guerre et de la destruction qu'elle entraine. (Saint-John Perse et quelques devanciers (I960), p. 216) Without wishing to take sides in the bickering which Saillet and Jean Paulhan indulged in on the subject, it is at least interesting to note that the latter wrote: 'I1 est certain que: L'astre roue vif sur la pierre du seuil et la derniere palpitation solaire sur le seuil solitaire ne contiennent pas la moindre allusion a la croix gammee.'l A study of the image in context will perhaps lead to a just assessment of its function and meaning in the poem, and confirmation that Mile Parent's suggestions are the most valuable. The first important feature is the time-setting: there is a clear suggestion, as is specified later in the poem, that 'c'est un peu apres midi, a l'heure de grande viduite' (Exil, vi). Whereas in earlier poems the threshold had been associated with shadow, with that half-light which suggests the ambivalence of dawn or dusk, on the threshold between day and night, here the fierce midday sun puts the poem, like Anabase, under the sign of Leo, in July and August. The Sun in Leo is at his greatest strength, and in Exil we stand at the 'partage de midi'. On the threshold of a new country and of a new life, the poet exposes himself to the sun's twofold effect: its destructive power and its life-giving force. It is understandable that Perse's feelings should be reflected in the searing, white-hot images of the summer sun's rays, and of the heat-haze rising invisibly, yet distorting the vision, from the asbestos beach. The particular characteristic of asbestos is that it is heat- resistant, and the Greek root of the French word, tpxLav-ro;, means incorruptible, undefiled, or pure. It is not impossible that Perse knew Aeschylus's reference to the sea as simply ] a&amp;iCAvrov (Persae, 578): it would tally with the idea of moisture evaporating from the sea's edge that provides the immediate visual source of the image. Certainly the whole notion of purity is of central importance in Perse. The 1 Saillet, pp. 183-7 and Cahiers de la Pleiade, edited by Jean Paulhan, io (ete-automne, 1950), p. 188. The second of the Paulhan 'quotations' does not occur in Perse's published work. It is of course possible that it features in a private letter from the poet, but it is more likely to be the sort of hybrid formation such as Caillois created on the word 'explication' (Roger Caillois, Poetique de St-John Perse (1954), p. 206).</page><page sequence="4">780 The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse purity of the beach is its nakedness, chosen by the poet as a place that chimes with his longing for solitude to reflect on the events which have brought him to the New World and all the welter of emotions his uprooting has evoked. Professor Knodel can write with authority as an American who has spoken with Perse on several occasions about some of the details: The spring of I941 was a dark moment for France and for most of the rest of Europe, and Leger's state of mind seems to have been particularly distressed at that time. Feeling the need for complete isolation, he accepted the offer of Francis and Katherine Biddle to spend some time at a beach-house of theirs on Long Beach Island. (Saint-John Perse (Edinburgh, i966), p. 61) Francis Biddle, the United States Attorney General, and his wife also received the dedication of Pluies, but for the moment we must return, with the circumstantial details now sketched in, to the image of 'l'astre roue vif sur la pierre du seuil'. There seem to be no good reasons for denying a connexion with the swastika, but again no good reason for restricting its significance to the emblem of Hitler's Germany. For the swastika has a history going back to the remotest times, and is essentially a sun-symbol: 'Les images le plus frequemment associees a la croix gammee sont les representations du soleil et des divinites solaires.' A variant on that most primitive of symbols, the cross, it serves to indicate rotatory motion by its crooked arms: Dans l'ordre des figures cruciformes, la spirale a pour correspondant le swastika, symbole des plus riches que d'innombrables civilisations ont adopte comme embleme majeur. Le swastika symbolise l'axe vertical d'un manege a quatre bras, dont le mouvement de rotation est exprim6 par le retour de chacun des bras.1 As a form of conjunction between square and circle, it consequently finds expression in most societies, however primitive, and as the mandala forms a vital symbol in Jung's collective unconscious. Here there is the violence of torture in bringing the sun down to preside as a divinity over the threshold: the poet's private situation is thrown on to a universal and cosmic level. To restrict the meaning of the image to any one aspect or level would be not only to do it less than justice but also to miss the very notion of ambiguity which is central to the poet's work. It is natural that the threshold should appear at the very heart of this ambiguity, and natural too that the threshold should extend from the doorstep of Perse's retreat to the beach itself, standing at the threshold between land and sea, holding the balance between 3,000 miles of Atlantic Ocean separating him from France and his family, and the 3,000 miles of his adopted continent. The poet, bifrons, and in more ways than one 'bilingue', is at the vital fulcrum-point, and the precision and power of his evocation can be shown by further reference to this brief but intense opening section of Exil: 'L'et6e de gypse aiguise ses fers de lance dans nos plaies.' The heat of Summer, white like gypsum, twists the tips of its shafts of burning sunlight in the exile's wounds. The image is amplified, without alteration, in the following lines: J'1lis un lieu flagrant et nul comme l'ossuaire des saisons, Et, sur toutes greves de ce monde, l'esprit du dieu fumant d6serte sa couche d'amiante. The barren, burning beach (nul, and flagrant in its Latin sense) is a place of the poet's own election, and stretches its sun-bleached stones before him like a bone-heap of passing years. The rattling of pebbles on the beach is later given a 1 Le Comte Goblet D'Alviella, La migration des symboles (I891), p. 72; G. de Champeaux and Dom Sebastien Sterckx, Le monde des symboles (I966), p. 25.</page><page sequence="5">ROGER LITTLE 78I further link with bones: 'Et la mer at la ronde roule son bruit de cranes sur les greves.' Colour is virtually absent: white, or at most a touch of pale yellow, alternates with complete transparency. The negation of colour itself reflects the state of exile, the fragile world of glass at the critical translucent point of juncture between earth and sea, expressed with brilliant precision later in the poem in the image of 'le pur nautile des eaux libres' (Exil, iv). The thin skirt of the nautilus mollusc is as transparent as the edge of the sea washing the shore. Every aspect of the picture is right: the delicate balance between two worlds, the colourless state of the exile, the insecure sand on which he may try to build his future (and, oddly enough, true to the gospel prophecy, the beach-house lent by the Biddies has since been washed away by a storm), the exact poetic transcription of observed phenomena. One's intellectual and emotional responses seem fully satisfied, but for the intellect at least there are further rewards. Gypsum is commonly known in its forms as alabaster or plaster of Paris. It generally occurs in crystalline form, the crystals being rhomboid and frequently 'twinned', or joined in pairs. It will be seen that two rhomboid crystals joined together will form a shape suggesting either swallow-tail or arrowhead, and this made, known in English by both these terms, is called in French gypsefer de lance: 'C'est la made de deux cristaux lenticulaires qui produit la variete connue sous le nom defer de lance; sa couleur est jaunatre' (Grand Larousse Encyclopedique, s.v. Gypse). The use of gypsum as an epithet for summer is consequently more than justified: even the colour is no longer the white of alabaster but the yellowish tinge of arrowhead gypsum, no longer matt but gleaming. A slight excursion out of the all too often closed world of literature, in which Perse has refused to be imprisoned -'Mon nom n'appartient pas aux lettres' he writes, in the Lettre sur Jacques Riviere - reveals something of his breadth of interest in the world around him and the exactness of both his observation and notation in this superb transferred epithet.1 The word seuil recurs eight times in Exil alone, indicating its importance as a symbol in the poem. Leaving aside the occurrences of the word which have maritime connexions, one finds a close link with a shadowy but forceful girl who reappears at different moments throughout the poem. Seen as a wandering courtesan haunting the poet's dreams and standing enticingly on his threshold, she comes to represent Poetry itself, a Romantic Muse figure who could say to Perse what Musset's vision said in the Nuit de decembre: 'Ami, je suis la solitude'. Archibald MacLeish indicates the same reply: Certainly when he (i.e. Perse) came to Washington, poetry was the last thing in his mind. When, cautiously, I spoke to him at that time of the opportunity for his own work which the Library could offer, I was told, almost harshly, that there could be no thought, no possibility, of poetry again. But all this is explained, for those who have ears to hear, in Exil: "Que voulez-vous encore de moi, 6 souffle originel? Et vous, que pensez-vous encore tirer de ma levre vivante..." There is a small, naked house on the long New Jersey beaches, facing east across the whole Atlantic, where, if I do not misread the poem, Perse faced not only his exile from his country, but the demand upon him - the ancient and often silenced demand - of that one companion of his journey whom, of all companions, he could not leave behind. ('Le temps de la louange', Cahiers de la Pleiade, Io (et6-automne, 950), I I7-I8) 1 Gaston Bachelard includes in his 'herbier mineralogique' this very macle: 'Sans doute, un beau gypse en fer de lance nous fait songer maintenant a une feuille de la sagittaire' (La Terre et les reveries de la volonte (1948), p. 245).</page><page sequence="6">782 The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse A continuation of the sentence quoted from Exil will show clearly how the insistence and persistence of poetry is personified: Et vous, que pensez-vous encore tirer de ma levre vivante, O force errante sur mon seuil, 6 Mendiante dans nos voies et sur les traces du Prodigue? (Exil, Im) The beggar-girl will allow the exile no rest, no time for self-commiseration or indulgence in silence. He has tried to dismiss her, but she comes again and again in the night to remind him of the almost sacred duty of a poet to write: Et qui donc avant l'aube erre aux confins du monde avec ce cri pour moi ? Quelle grande fille r6pudiee s'en fut au sifflement de l'aile visiter d'autres seuils . . ? Partout-errante fut son nom de courtisane chez les pretres, aux grottes vertes des Sibylles, et le matin sur notre seuil sut effacer les traces de pieds nus, parmi de saintes 6critures ... (Exil, Iv) On the threshold of his temporary refuge, at the threshold of day, the poet lies in wait on the threshold of poetry 'pour l'echeance d'un mot pur'. Any doubt that this courtesan is the poet's Muse is dispelled when the following lines, again from Exil, iv, are stood parallel: Et l'Npouse nocturne avant l'aurore reconduite ... Et les poemes de la nuit avant l'aurore r6pudids. Her name, 'Partout-errante', finds a further echo in the final section of the poem: ... Tais-toi, faiblesse, et toi, parfum d'6pouse dans la nuit comme l'amande meme de la nuit. Partout errante sur les greves, partout errante sur les mers, tais-toi, douceur, et toi, prdsence gree d'ailes a hauteur de ma selle. Je reprendrai ma course de Numide, longeant la mer inali6nable . .. Applying faiblesse and douceur to his mother, mentioned earlier in this section and later the dedicatee of that most poignant of the poems of exile, Neiges, the second toi in either case is addressed to the Muse who shares his exile. Any anger or grief felt at the outset, and expressed in the image of the sun tortured on the threshold, has been exorcized, and principally through the very act of writing, so that a fresh start can be made: 'et la consigne est de laver la pierre de vos seuils .. . ' (Exil, vnI). It seems improbable that the image of the threshold could assume richer conno- tations, and yet, apart from its use as a thing in itself, its significance is extended into the realm of the metaphysical, linked closely in this sense with the increasingly insistent image of the sea-shore which understandably finds its fullest expression in Amers. Apart from its mention, in Vents, II, 2, in the same terms as we have noted in Anabase: 'Au seuil d'un grand pays sans titre ni devise, au seuil d'un grand pays de bronze vert ... ', the implications are always associated with the metaphysical, however rooted the images remain in concrete reality. Introduced, significantly, by the mention of shamans, the winds are said to smell of fires on invisible thresholds: Les vallees mortes, a grands cris, s'6veillent dans les gorges, s'6veillent et fument a nouveau sur leurs lits de shamans! Les vents sentent les feux sur d'invisibles seuils. (Vents, I, 5) Apart from the idea of valleys awakening, suggesting dawn, there are further echoes here of that particular 'in-between' state of things we have already seen associated with the threshold. The dust rising from dried-up valleys may be equated</page><page sequence="7">ROGER LITTLE 783 with the heat-haze rising from the beach in Exil, I, and the notion of divinity echoed in those ecstatic mediators between men and gods, the shamans. But here the thresholds are invisible: geographically, they are distant, but they are also gateways to a visionary, metaphysical world which is not available to human sight. What the shamans do for others, the threshold does for Perse. Later references in Vents indicate this as the meaning the poet is driving at: 'Et l'ausculteur du Prince defaille sur son ouie - comme le visionnaire au seuil de sa vision' (Vents, In, 2). And again, after a splendid passage about the poet's own position and function: "Tu te r6veleras, chiffre perdu! . . . Que trop d'attente n'aille enerver L'usage de notre ouie! nulle impurete souiller le seuil de la vision! . . ." (Vents, im, 6) These are still, necessarily and understandably, linked with the poet. Indeed the poem continues: 'Et le Poete encore est avec nous, parmi les hommes de son temps, habite de son mal ... '. But the language has become more abstract than before, and the poet has time to speculate beyond the immediate requirements of everyday existence. Where these speculations take place, and where Perse makes poetry both of them and of the realities of his environment is again the threshold, in its guise as the beach: 'Lieu du propos: toutes greves de ce monde' (Vents, II, 6). The choice of this place of ambiguitypar excellence could not be stated more emphatically, and in Amers the theme is to recur so insistently that no doubt can remain as to its importance. The poet, 'l'homme parlant dans l'equivoque', recognizes the funda- mental duality of human nature, but rather than separating off the two components, allows the whole to stand in ambiguity. It would be wrong, however, to suggest that Perse should be viewed as a philo- sopher rather than as a poet. The clarity of the threshold image throughout Perse's work acts as a corrective to such a tendency, but it is interesting to see Gaston Bachelard, philosopher of poetry, dwelling (in his La poetique de l'espace (I964)) on what he terms 'la dialectique du dehors et du dedans ... l'homme est l'etre entr'ouvert'. With his comments on the door we come full circle and recall the notations of anthropologists: 'Pourquoi ne pas sentir que dans la porte est incarne un petit dieu du seuil? Faut-il aller jusqu'a un lointain passe, un passe qui n'est pas le notre, pour sacraliser le seuil?' (p. 200). With a sure instinct, Perse focuses attention through the image of the threshold on an exploration of the fundamental dialectic of the human condition. The various aspects of the threshold, from the doorstep to the shore, and from there to the threshold of the other world, receive in Amers their fullest and clearest expression. The intricate interaction of the various aspects in Exil is understandably teased out in the epic length of Perse's great poem of love and the sea, and its metaphysical facet is developed more fully. The whole drama of loving is played out on the threshold, both love and the sea performing identical functions as thresholds in themselves: 'O face aimante, loin du seuil . . . Oiu combats-tu si loin queje n'y sois?' (Amers, Strophe, ix, 6-I). Clearly the invitation to look beyond the immediate limitations of the human condition is accepted; the conjunction of the physical with the spiritual both stated and explored: 'La pierre du seuil se couvre d'arborescences pales, de presages' (Amers, Strophe, Ix, 5-I). It is love itself, desire and passion, which is the maieutic force creating the very need in man to look for something beyond: 'O passion, voie royale... ! Desir, desir... O toi qui fais crier au loin le sable sur d'invisibles</page><page sequence="8">784 The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse seuils ( ix, 4-2). And love itself is seen as sharing the ambiguous qualities associated with the threshold: the poet links Eros and Janus in his benediction to dispel any doubt: 'Bonne course a vos pas, divinites du seuil et de l'alc6ve!' (Strophe, v). And yet even this cannot be restricted to a straight-forward image relationship. The cosmic overtones of love-making are expressed, and this is increasingly the case as the poem progresses, so that the elemental qualities of a creation-myth are made apparent. Land and sea couple at their point of juncture, at the 'region critique' of the beach. Perse is restating one of the basic myths, and familiarity with almost any creation-myth on the part of the reader will elicit echoes in the poet's work. He himself mentions in his work Ea, Cain, and Baal, all of them connected with various Middle Eastern creation myths in which water or slime is the original chaotic element from which Order was created: Blessure ouverte au flanc terrestre pour l'intrusion sacree, dechirement de notre nuit et resplendissement de l'autre - pierre du seuil lavee d'amour et lieu terrible de la d6secration! (Amers, Chceur, 3) On the threshold of the unknown, one's frequent recourse is to the sort of basic tale of one's ancestors that creation myths represent: 'Au seuil d'un si grand Ordre ou l'Aveugle officie, nous nous sommes voile la face du songe de nos peres' (Amers, Strophe, iv). Order, with a capital, is of prime importance for Perse who is himself creating order of a high degree out of the disparate data the world presents. Hence the importance of this cry: 'Seuil de la connaissance! avant-seuil de l'eclat! . . ' (Strophe, II). The eclat, a central word in Perse's vocabulary, is a symbol of the quasi-divine insight or intuition, lying somewhere beyond the mere knowledge of things and facts, which opens the door for him to understanding and so to poetry. But because it builds upon and stems from knowledge, and not any Romantic agony, a greater sense of order is implied than is traditionally the case with inspiration. Again the echo of the creation myths is clear: 'Nous franchissons enfin le vert royal du Seuil; et faisant plus que de rever, nous te foulons, fable divine! . . . ' (Amers, Chaeur, 2). The divine fable is trodden underfoot because Perse has managed to re-tell it starting from purely human and material data: his mythology is as intensely anthropomorphic as that of the Greeks, with the difference that the objects with which he starts retain their complete individuality and honour as objects.1 The question posed by the Patrician women: 'Ou vint la chose a nous manquer, et le seuil quel est-il que nous n'avons foule?' (Amers, Strophe, iv), which echoes so many similar questions throughout Perse's work, is to receive an answer to its second part at least in the course of the poem. Taken quite literally, with 'la chose' in its generic and general sense of 'things', the poem also attempts an answer to the first part, and to discover at what point 'things fall apart'. That point is the threshold, where one stands, like the sea, 'au seuil d'une autre Immensite . . '. To a further question, essentially rhetorical, the answer implied is similar: 'Est-ce toi, fumee du seuil, qui de toi-meme montes en nous comme l'esprit sacre du vin?' (Amers, Chour, 2). This is an echo of 'cette grande chose sourde par le monde et qui s'accroit soudain comme une ebriete' from Exil, III. 'I1 faut etre toujours ivre' perhaps, but Perse, more Apollonian, wishes to give 1 In this, Perse anticipates the theorists of the nouveau roman: see A. Robbe-Grillet: 'Si je dis: "Le monde c'est l'homme", j'obtiendrai toujours l'absolution; tandis que si je dis: "les choses sont les choses, et l'homme n'est que l'homme", je suis aussitot reconnu coupable de crime contre l'humanite' ('Nature, humanisme, tragedie', in Pour un nouveau roman (I963), p. 47).</page><page sequence="9">ROGER LITTLE 785 coherence and structure to his heady vision. And yet there comes a point where a metaphysical fervour which can only be called Dionysiac overcomes him: Et au-dela s'ouvre la Mer etrangere, au sortir des d6troits, qui n'est plus mer de tacheron, mais seuil majeur du plus grand Orbe et seuil insigne du plus grand Age, ou le pilote est congedi6 - Mer ouverture du monde d'interdit, sur l'autre face de nos songes! ah, comme l'outrepas du songe, et le songe meme qu'on n'osa! . .. (Amers, Chaeur, 3) All the elements have been scrupulously prepared in the course of the poem: the fisherman has approached and passed through straits reminiscent of the Symple- gades, and the pilot, associated with the lover, played his crucial part. The image of the far side of the dream started with the face of the loved one forbidden to the lover like the far side of satellite moons (for the poem dates from a decade before the first photographs of our moon's far side): for man on earth, only a half can be known at any one time whether of faces or moons, but the poet somehow manages to turn the spheres and see the forbidden face: 'Aux clartes d'iode et de sel noir du songe mediateur, ... la face, soudain, du monde revele dont nous ne lirons plus l'avers' (Amers, Chweur, 2). Once the light is seen, there is no turning back. Chronique continues the metaphysical speculation on the 'mer d'outremer et d'outresonge', and it is scarcely surprising to find the threshold image retained: 'Une autre mer au loin s'eleve: . . . tres haut seuil en flamme a l'horizon des hommes de toujours' (Chronique, I). This almost apocalyptic vision, reminiscent in some respects of certain surrealist paintings, is true to the mystical expressions which speculation on death provokes: 'Nous vivons d'outre-mort, et de mort meme vivrons-nous' (Chronique, 2). If flights of this sort or investigations into the things of this world and the nature of human relationships, including that, most central, of man with himself, were not so firmly rooted in such a material object as a doorstep, not only would proportion and human relevance be lost or tend to be lost, but there would also be a danger of losing the poetry. Perse guards scrupulously against abstraction. The threshold allows him to range into the supremely fascinating world of ambiguity, and use it as a springboard, sublimating the image into the realms of this world and the other, the universal and the metaphysical. There is no neat one-to-one relationship between a particular poem and a particular theme: as we have already seen, the threshold is not restricted to Exil, and the sea-shore stretches well beyond Amers. This is not to deny development. However much one may see seeds of Perse's style and imagery in the earliest published work, and see the same forceful guiding hand behind all the poems, a development is similarly clear. Again it is a gradual move away from a specific preoccupation with the physical, through broader connotations of the material image, towards a gesture of speculation on the metaphysical. It is a shift in emphasis rather than of subject, which remains essentially grounded in this world. Early suggestions of an interest in the in-between states on which Perse is to build so much offer only in retrospect a basis for wider application. Reading Eloges, for example, the immediate reaction is to the physical and sensual qualities of the poems. The plenitude of the land and solitude of the sea are posited explicitly, without the poet delving into the nature and implications of their point of meeting. Halcyon expanses of purity stand in opposition to the 'vegetales ferveurs' of the poet's tropical island home. Distinctions were sharp, brilliant colours reflecting the child's clear-cut ideas, brought up as he was with a sure sense of hierarchy and propriety in all things: 'Et tout n'etait que regnes et confins de lueurs' (Pourfeter une so</page><page sequence="10">786 The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse enfance, in and iv). One sees a poetic parallel to the bright, often unshaded, colours in the tropical canvasses of Gauguin (whose work Perse certainly knew from 1905 since his friend at Bordeaux, Gabriel Frizeau, then owned the great canvas D'ou venons- nous? Qui sommes-nous? i0 allons-nous? of 898) or the Douanier Rousseau. But there is also a similarity in their sense of two-dimensional mass - their expanses of green, blue, or ochre. If the child has an instinctive liking for the doorstep (and how often children seem to concentrate their games at this point midway between safety and adventure) - 'Et l'enfant veut qu'on le peigne sur le pas de la porte' - it is Exil that brings us face to face with its full poetic significance. It is Exit, too, as we have seen, that specifies and elaborates upon the conjunction of threshold and beach. One passage, purposely left aside from the earlier discussion, can now serve to indicate, through its complexity, the links between the various aspects of the image: . .. Plus haute, chaque nuit, cette clameur muette sur mon seuil, plus haute, chaque nuit, cette lev6e de siecles sous l'caille, Et, sur toutes greves de ce monde, un iambe plus farouche a nourrir de mon etre! ... Tant de hauteur n'epuisera la rive accore de ton seuil, 6 Saisisseur de glaives a l'aurore, O Manieur d'aigles par leurs angles, et Nourrisseur des filles les plus aigres sous la plume de fer! (Exil, lm) Certain elements of these very involved lines have already been simplified: the silent clamour is essentially the insistent demand of the Muse. The stanzas in quotation marks in this section of the poem are all the voice of 'mon frere le poete'. Much of the imagery is drawn from poetry: the repeated 'clameur' evokes in turn 'un gonflement de lkvres sur la naissance des grands Livres', 'une seule et longue phrase sans cesure a jamais inintelligible', 'les stances de l'exil', and here 'un iambe plus farouche a nourrir de mon &amp;tre'. The exile's introductory words are, quite logically, the clue to the threshold-beach image of the passage: 'Et soudain tout m'est force et presence, oh fume encore le theme du neant' (Exil, IIi). One is immediately reminded of the data of the poem, of the barren beach and the nothingness from which the poem is composed, with the full support of verbal echoes in both 'fumee' and 'neant': J'elis un lieu flagrant et nul comme l'ossuaire des saisons, Et, sur toutes greves de ce monde, l'esprit du dieu fumant d6serte sa couche d'amiante. (Exil, I) Ma gloire est sur les sables! ma gloire est sur les sables! ... Et ce n'est point errer, 6 Peregrin, Que de convoiter l'aire la plus nue pour assembler aux syrtes de l'exil un grand poeme ne de rien, un grand poeme fait de rien ... J'ai fonde sur l'abime et 1'embrun et la fumee des sables. (Exil, In) No doubt can remain that it is on the shore - the threshold - of the New World, though essentially on any shore in the world, that Perse can construct his poem out of the very quicksand ambivalence of the site. The second pair of versets of the passage under consideration presents further difficulties. The clamour is said to rise higher each night, and so to get louder, but its relation to what follows is obscure. What can be affirmed with a fair degree of assurance is that the 'Saisisseur . . . Manieur . . . et Nourrisseur' is the sun. Apart</page><page sequence="11">ROGER LITTLE 787 from the visual effect of the sun's rays at dawn and their traditional designation as swords - the word 'shafts' in English is a parallel example of what Emerson called 'fossil poetry' -a phrase from Amers dispels all doubt: 'avant l'aurore et les glaives du jour'. Saillet (p. Io8) suggests the following phrase derived from Perse's reading of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, but the poet denied all knowledge of it. Others have drawn legitimate attention to the interplay of sound in the words 'aigle', 'angles', and 'aigres', but Perse is not a poet to play emptily with sounds for their own sake. The eagle is traditionally associated with the sun, and the Manieur may be assimilated with the Saisisseur by their function. From this the pattern of a circus image is revealed, and continues in the Nourrisseur. So, re- membering the double meaning of both 'cirque' and 'arene', an earlier line is perhaps recalled: 'J'epie au cirque le plus vaste l'elancement des signes les plus fastes' (Exil, ii), and a later one prefigured: 'et sur l'arene sans violence, l'exil et ses cles pures' (Exil, v). An analysis of such material necessarily gives an unfortunate impression of ingenious contrivance: the poet, with this major theme of'la rive accore de ton seuil' in mind as a springboard for the imagery, would have made the analogies and necessary cross-fertilization without the slightest difficulty. Apollo, the Sun-god, is seen as the ring-master of dawn: Toute chose a naitre s'horripile a l'orient du monde, toute chose naissante exulte aux premiers feux du jour! (Exil, III) Caillois (p. 62) has shown how the second half of this verset develops the first to give a splendid sense of day breaking, and for Perse the word orient would retain its full Latin force to emphasize the sun's rising. But the central issue of the meaning of hauteur has still to be tackled. Rather than turning to book-learning, one should consider what the eye sees. From sea-level, the poet looks eastwards over the Atlantic towards the rising sun. Behind him lie the dunes, before him the sharply lit line of the horizon. Thinking of an image in Pluies, I, 'la reponse des hautes dunes a l'etagement des mers' which recalls Rimbaud's 'et l'on tira les barques vers la mer etag6e la-haut comme sur les gravures' (from the first of his Illuminations), we remember that the horizontal expanses of the sea are translated in painting on to a vertical plane. The sea becomes vertical on the human retina: 'Retine ouverte au plus grand cirque; et l'ame avide de son risque ... Voici la chose vaste en Ouest, et sa fraicheur d'abime sur nos faces.' This line from Chronique, 6, has the poet facing no longer east but west, but the echo is nonetheless clear. Once the verticality of the sea can be established, the difficulty is all but resolved: the horizon is an immense doorstep for the sun, and the poet's Muse can never hope to compete with the height of an utterly cosmic threshold or express fully the sun and every- thing under it. Human history and art merely lap against the doorstep of such total powers as the sun and the sea. And yet the Muse still insists: 'Tu ne te tairas point, clameur! que je n'aie depouille sur les sables toute allegeance humaine' (Exil, III). The impulse towards the deification of poetry, a lure for any writer, is both a danger - which Perse's detractors have seized on - and a motivation for supreme artistry. Both Exil and Amers are played out at the edge of the sea, and both derive much of their central imagery from the fact. But in most of the other poems too the critical shore is mentioned or its equivalent proposed. If it starts essentially as an expression of la poesie des departs with which Perse was to sympathize so much in</page><page sequence="12">788 The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse the form given it by Valery Larbaud, it did not remain at that stage: 'Le regard fixe au large, tu attendais l'instant du depart, le lever du grand vent qui te descel- lerait d'un coup, comme un typhon, divisant les nuees devant l'attente de tes yeux' (Images a Crusoe: Le Livre). Then the sea was 'hantee d'invisibles departs'. By the time of Amitie du Prince, the letter addressed to the poet reads: 'Toi tu te plais aux longs deplacements sans cause. Je connais ce tourment de l'esprit. Je t'enseignerai la source de ton mal' (Amitie du Prince, iii). Ideas and epithets of distance recur more and more often in Perse's output, and that of departure and travel becomes the very framework for the majestic epic of oriental spaces, Anabase. As an expression of the nomadic nature of man's spirit, it epitomizes the very notion of la poesie des departs while avoiding any of the superficiality or Romantic exoticism into which the genre has all too often slipped. Reinforced by all the overtones of poetic creation and profound spirituality, the poem concludes triumphantly: Terre arable du songe! Qui parle de batir? -J'ai vu la terre distribu6e en de vastes espaces et ma pens&amp;e n'est point distraite du navigateur. One of the earliest lists to occur in Perse's work includes only those who share his migratory instincts: Hommes, gens de poussiere et de toutes facons, gens de n6goce et de loisir, gens des confins et gens d'ailleurs, 6 gens de peu de poids dans la memoire de ces lieux; ... 6 chercheurs, 6 trouveurs de raisons pour s'en aller ailleurs. (Anabase, I) The passage ends splendidly with the many-sided image: les tambours de 1'exil 6veillent aux frontieres l'eternite qui baille sur les sables. The precarious restlessness is something accepted as a force for good. To stand still is to atrophy, to die. Consequently it is seen as an integral part of the human condition that however splendid and satisfying the immediate environment may appear, we are always aware of an urge to 'fare forward'. We are always in a state of exile, and none more so than the man who uses his faculties to the full, since he is more fully receptive to the present, but also more acutely aware of his unfulfilled potential. Although Anabase shows an important manifestation of the same idea, the terms are necessarily different since the poem is set inland, although starting beside the sea. The series of American poems includes, apart from Exil and Amers which take place on the sea-shore itself, a number of references to its importance. In Vents, IV, 2, for example, is the clipped and forceful: 'Ici la greve et la suture'. The mighty forces of the winds 'disposaient, sur toutes gr6ves, des grands desastres intellectuels' (Vents, I, 3). But again as this is rather an epic of the North American continent, these are not essentially sea-winds. Yet of the sea Perse can still write: 'Et de toutes parts au loin elle m'est presente et proche, et de toutes parts au loin elle m'est alliance et grace, et circonlocution' (Vents, Iv, 2). The final word here, standing outside the repeated phrasing and rhythm, is highly significant. We have met before the association of poetic creation and the threshold or beach in discussing Exil. The word circumlocution expresses a relationship between the sea and language which can admit of the fullest development.' If, in Vents, we are 1 See my forthcoming article 'Language as imagery in St.-J. Perse', in Forum for Modern Language Studies.</page><page sequence="13">ROGER LITTLE 789 further inland, it is a corresponding image, that of slopes down either side of a central watershed, which takes over the ambiguity of the sea-shore. We have 'tous les versants offerts au vent qui passe' (ii, 2) and 'les etagements gradues de ce versant du monde' (iv, 2) which support a passage frequently quoted as a guide to Perse's poetic: - Textes recus en langage clair! versions donnees sur deux versants! . . . O Poete, 6 bilingue, entre toutes choses bisaigues, et toi-meme litige entre toutes choses litigieuses - homme assailli du dieu! homme parlant dans I'equivoque! . . . (Vents, ii, 6) The poet's own position is clearly allied to that of the special intercourse of land and sea, or of any equivalent image evoking ambiguity, insecurity, and at the same time creativity, poetry being born of the conjunction of such forces, in themselves nothing, but being sublimated through the art of words. The refrain from Pluies pinpoints the relationship: 'le'cume aux levres du poeme'. ('Et ne l'ai-je pas dit? les ecritures aussi evolueront. -Lieu du propos: toutes greves de ce monde', Vents, II, 6). It is understandable that one of a poet's main pre- occupations should be with the nature of poetry and of words, and with the mystery of creation. Perse is far less introvert than many in this respect, and yet it lies almost constantly just below the surface. For creating order is man's highest function, in his eyes, and so a worthy occupation not only for the poet but for any human being. For the moment let us return to 'les tres longues plages renouvelees'. It is clear that the beach does not have the same value in Exil as in Amers. The sense of deprivation and nudity after suffering political exile is reversed in the richness of love. And yet with the foregoing argument in mind, it can be seen how the point of maximum precariousness becomes that of greatest fulfilment. Plenitude is closer to solitude than platitude is to either. The beach in Exil is a place for stripping, both physically and spiritually: Comme celui qui se devet a la vue de la mer ... Les mains plus nues qu'a ma naissance et la levre plus libre ... Me voici restitue a ma rive natale .. . I n'est d'histoire que de lame, il n'est d'aisance que de 1'ame. (Exil, v) 'L'Etranger parmi les sables' must have stripped off all human allegiance before positive creativity can recommence. Exil has as its key words purity, nullity, and nudity, and as its pivotal image the deserted beach. There is, however, the resource- fulness of the experienced man, 'le grain seme sur la cote deserte pour le voyage de retour. . . ' (Amers, Strophe, Ix, 5-2). With a sure sense of hierarchy, the poet writes: 'Oiu vont les sables a leur chant s'en vont les Princes de l'exil' (Exil, In). And he turns the tables on exile by the self-inflicted command: 'Honore, 6 Prince, ton exil!' (Exil, III). If there are high passions on the sands of exile, then the poet must express them. While one can sympathize with the poet having 'no thought, no possibility, of poetry again' at the moment of crisis, it is clear that his very integrity demanded it of him once a material and psychological readjustment had taken place. Exil describes the very birth of this new awareness, building poetry afresh on that paradoxically surest of foundations - sand: 'Je reprendrai ma course de Numide, longeant la mer inalienable' (Exil, vnI). The extension of this newly found positive aspect of the sea shore as the threshold to new vistas of plenitude can well be seen by reference to Amers. The multiplicity of connotation in the title itself suggests that of the poem: apart from the 'Seamarks'</page><page sequence="14">The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse of the translated title, there are echoes of bitter gall, of 'amour' (sometimes spelt 'amer' in medieval French) and of 'mer' itself. From the poem, with its central imagery revolving around the sea and love, the title could be a crossing of mer with amour. It is truly Persean that an actual word with even wider associations, and just as appropriate, should have been used. But lurking also is what Milosz called 'l'amer amour de l'autre monde'. If in Perse parts of the body are applied to the shore (and in the word cote both meanings coincide for another example of 'fossil poetry' waiting to be unearthed), so the procedure can allow parts of the body to be designated in terms of the shore. Not only, therefore, do we read: 'Etrange l'homme, sans rivage, pres de la femme, riveraine' (Amers, Strophe, IX, 2-2), but also: 'Tu sens les dunes immortelles et toutes rives indivises ou tremble le songe, pavot pale' (Amers, Strophe, Ix, 3-2), and again: 'Et sur la greve de mon corps, l'homme ne de mer s'est allonge' (Amers, Strophe, Ix, 2-I). The union of sea and land is mirrored in that of the lovers, and again the image plays midwife to the metaphysical issue: 'O gout de 'Fame tres foraine, nous diras-tu la rive que tu suis?' (Amers, Strophe, IX, 5-2). The word foraine is less connected here with its origins at thefoire than with its use in the expression rade foraine, or with its Latin rootforanus, foreign. The soul had earlier been associated with the sea when in Exil, vII, the poet's mother is addressed: '6 toi plus prompte a tressaillir sur l'autre rive de son ame', but there the other shore of his soul was as much the sheer memory of the France and family he had had to leave. In Amers the very opening of the Invocation throws us straight away on to other shores: 'Et vous, Mers, qui lisiez dans de plus vastes songes .. . '. The sense of bringing to the brink - sometimes implying disaster, sometimes fruition - is expressed in: 'Ah! qu'un plus large mouvement des choses a leur rive, de toutes choses a leur rive et comme en d'autres mains, nous alienat enfin l'antique Magicienne' (Amers, Strophe, I, 4). This constantly repeated notion of being on the verge of some marvellous discovery, whether of a rare plant or bird or of some mystical insight, provides intense excitement, and captivates by its immense enthusiasm for life in all its forms. The march of earthly phenomena down to the sea- Cities, Tragediennes, Patrician women, in fact 'toute chose', on the earth's 'incessante avancee de sa levre d'argile' (Chronique, 7) - is an act of homage performed not only 'au bord des Grandes Eaux' but also 'a la limite de l'humain' in every sense. And a certain question mark still of necessity remains at the end of the poem: 'Quelles filles noires et sanglantes vont sur les sables violents longeant l'effacement des choses ?' (Amers, Dedicace). Hence the necessary ambivalence of a closing line: ' Nous qui mourrons peut-etre un jour disons l'homme immortel au foyer de l'instant.' On the threshold of eternity, 'le doute s'eleve sur la realite des choses' (Anabase, III). Yet again there is a double view of the relationship between things and the sea: if things pay homage or lemming-like, disappear into the primeval element, it is the sea, 'elle-meme voyageuse', which allows things to be appreciated for what they are: 6 Mer pldniere conciliee, Est-ce toi, Nomade, qui nous passeras ce soir aux rives du reel? (Amers, Chour, 5) The sea is in its turn the threshold, as we have seen, to that sort of 'super-reality' in which things play their part, both as themselves and as images of metaphysical 790</page><page sequence="15">ROGER LITTLE 79I counterparts: 'Et au-dela s'ouvre la Mer etrangre, . . . seuil majeur du plus grand Orbe et seuil insigne du plus grand Age' (Amers, Chour, 3). Both spatial and temporal concepts are included in a sort of'pan-time', partaking of both immensity and eternity. Like Braque's painted birds, all phenomena 'emplissent l'espace poetique de l'homme, portes d'un trait reel jusqu'aux abords du surreel' (Oiseaux, 12). The thing itself, 'prise en son vif et dans son tout', is respected for what it is. The maieutics of threshold and beach sharpen sensitivity so as to allow an over-all appreciation of its significance. Only an attachment to concrete phenomena can permit any exploration of mystery and abstraction. Not only in space, but also in time Perse shows a predilection for the threshold of day and night, and again these are gradually assembled into a broader concep- tion of man standing on the verge of eternity. Any mystical tendency which this might suggest is, as in other fields, subordinate to the physical bases of the idea. The mention of dawn or dusk comes so frequently to Perse's pen that elaboration seems scarcely necessary. What is true of the spatial images of the threshold is also true of the temporal. Addressing the sea, Perse parallels the image of 'l'astre roue vif: 'Tu vas, tu vas, l'Immense et Vaine, et fais la roue au seuil d'une autre Immensite' (Amers, Chceur, 4). Fusing the two dimensions, he had written in Anabase, i: 'les tambours de l'exil eveillent aux frontieres | l'eternite qui baille sur les sables'. Later, in Oiseaux, io, Braque's birds act as mediators for the human being to stretch his whole being to its fullest extent, to fulfil himself as completely as possible in both space and time. And they fly in between sea and sky at the hic et nunc which is Perse's key to infinity, and the only one, in his view, with which it is humanly possible to open the doors of perception: 'A mi-hauteur entre ciel et mer, entre un amont et un aval d'eternite, ils sont nos mediateurs, et tendent de tout l'etre a l'etendue de l'etre .. . But dawn and dusk are not the only fulcrum-points of the fourth dimension. Noon and midnight are also springboards to something greater, and are frequently evoked in Perse's work. On three occasions a hyphen is added to mi-nuit to stress its origins as mid-point of the night. A broader time-scale may be seen by availing oneself fully of the special qualities of noon: a midi . .. l'homme clot ses paupieres et rafraichit sa nuque dans les ages, (Anabase, vi) d'autres ont vu ta face de midi, ou luit soudain la majeste terrible de l'Ancetre. (Amers, Strophe, Iv) From the beginning, Breton and Aragon could say of Eloges: 'Cherchez Monsieur Saintleger Leger dans Noon.' Reference is not restricted, however, to extension in time alone: the third and fourth dimensions interlock so much that Perse can fuse history and geography and write of 'la maturation, soudain, d'un autre monde au plein midi de notre nuit. . . ' (Vents, III, 5), and of the 'Solitude et tenebres au grand midi de l'homme' (Amers, Strophe, Ix, 5-2), and so speak of the poet 'attentif a sa lucidite, jaloux de son autorite, et tenant clair au vent le plein midi de sa vision' (Vents, III, 6). Here, as elsewhere, from humble origins, 'everyday' in all the senses of the word, the poet builds his more abstract notions on a sure and readily accessible basis. Corresponding to the four main points of the day - dawn, noon, dusk and midnight which are all temporal 'thresholds' in Perse's world, are their equivalent seasons in the course of the year: the solstices and equinoxes.</page><page sequence="16">792 The Threshold in the Poetry of Saint-John Perse Again links are forged with broader connotations, with the doorstep itself, with love, and with the intoxication of creation: Mer innocence du Solstice, Mer insouciance de l'accueil. Mer innocence du Solstice, 6 Mer comme le vin des Rois. (Amers, Choeur, 2 and 3) Comme au temps d'6quinoxe, dans les jumenteries, quand il est recommande aux gardiens de juments de prendre femmes au pays ... (Vents, IV, 5) What becomes clear from an investigation of such examples is that Perse, although capable of crossing 'le gue d'une quatrieme dimension' (Oiseaux, 5) through the medium of poetry, itself a threshold therefore, is far more attracted to spatial than to temporal extension. Beyond 'les sagaies de Midi [qui] vibrent aux portes de la joie' (Amers, Invocation, I), lies for Perse all the movement of geography and history, and the continuous spiritual paradox: 'We must be still and still moving'. So, with all the creative overtones (both sexual and poetic, which again overlap so much), the final Dedicace of Amers concentrates on noon: Midi, son peuple, ses lois fortes . . . ) Midi, ses forges, son grand ordre ... ( .. ) Midi, sa foudre, ses presages. The moment of noon opens out in a widening gyre to suggest the immensity that man can reach through the present alone. Perse's words to Henri Hoppenot: 'La vie n'est que la dilatation d'une seule journee' suggest the inter-relationship he senses between the two dimensions. The virtue, then, of threshold, beach, dawn, and noon is a precariousness which heightens awareness. In itself, each 'threshold' remains unchanged, stated unequivocally as valid for its own sake. But like a catalyst in a chemical reaction, it must be present for the reaction to take place. The sublimation occurs without denying or denaturing the area of space or time which lies on either side of the threshold, yet with a very complete exploration of both the contents and limits of either direction. The dialectic is a form of dualism in which both elements are positive. According to Pierre Mazars, Perse said: 'Chacun de nos ecrivains est precede du signe + ou du signe -'. Perse's sign would be a plus in bold type. His quest for order leads him from the precarious here and now into universal history and geography, but also into that spiritual infinity which alone can suggest a sense and pattern in existence. The threshold is a fine and central example of the application to his poetry of Perse's stated doctrine: Le poete a parfaitement le droit, et meme le devoir, d'aller explorer les domaines les plus obscurs, mais plus il va loin dans cette direction, plus il doit user de moyens d'expression concrets. Aussi loin qu'il p6netre dans l'au-dela irrationnel ou mystique, il est tenu de s'exprimer par des moyens reels, meme tir6s de sa vie experimentale.
