Don Quixote, I:xi Extremes meet. Ulysses, Circe TERRENCE DOODY - Maybe, but in realism you are down to facts on which the world is based: that sudden reality which smashes romanticism into a pulp. What makes most people's lives unhappy is some disappointed romanticism, some unrealizable or misconceived ideal. In fact you may say that idealism is the ruin of man, and if we lived down to fact, as primitive man had to do, we would be better off. That is what we are made for. Nature is quite unromantic. It is we who put romance into her, which is a false attitude, an egotism, absurd like all egotisms. In Ulysses I tried to keep close to fact. But a writer must maintain a continual struggle against the objective: that is his function. The eternal qualities are the imagination and the sexual instinct, and the formal life tries to suppress both. Out of this present conflict rise the phenomena of modern life. In my Mabbot Street scene I approached reality closer in my opinion than anywhere else in the book except perhaps for moments in the last chapter. These remarks, which are quoted from Arthur Power's Conversations with James Joyce, illustrate how difficult it is for anyone, even himself, to define realism both precisely and comprehensively.1 In the first passage, Joyce is the Catholic, classically-tempered writer who developed the theory of impersonality that Stephen Dedalus pronounces in A Portrait of the Artist; in the second passage, he is the intensely private, openly defiant writer of a book that managed to be both obscure and obscene. And in this passage, he confuses the issue further by apparently contradicting himself, for nothing in Circe seems to be like anything in Penelope. The Bunyan-like voice of Oxen of the Sun calls Circe "the land of Phenomenon." 2 There everything is reduced to a single level of being: the self and the world interpenetrate with no distinction between the inner and the outer, the past and the future, the living and the dead; clothing is costume; fantasies 1 Conversations with James Joyce, ed.

Penelope, by contrast, in its artless, unmediated representation of character has the primitive realism of Moll Flanders; and by the time we get to it, after chapters like Oxen of the Sun, Circe, and Ithaca, Penelope seems conventional. Joyce's contradictions could be resolved, perhaps, if we knew exactly what "moments" in Circe he refers to, but the ambivalence of his remarks is valuable because it expresses unself-consciously the polarity that has always been intrinsic to the idea of realism, the conflict between the world and self that he expresses in his desire to stay "down to fact" and to resist the "objective." This polarity, I think, is a fairly direct, traditional expression of the dualism in human nature. And in English, Raymond Williams explains, this polarity has meant that the word "real" itself, which is derived from res, has always signified both the physi- cal entity of a thing and the immaterial principle which lies beneath or beyond mere appearances-what the thing teally is.4 So, the history of realism has been the history of those ideas of what the thing really is, those essential principles which are the norms of being and meaning and which have changed throughout time. The course of their change is recorded in Erich Auerbach's Mimesis,5 and Auerbach's own great sympathy for so many of these ideas allows us to accept as uncontradictory Nietzsche's scorn for the ideal of realism-"Realism in art is an illusion, all the writers of all the ages were convinced they were realistic"- and Harry Levin's praise for its practice and moral purpose-"for all great writers, in so far as they are committed to a searching and scrupulous critique of life as they know it, may be reckoned among the realists." 6 The novel has flourished in this ambivalence, at least since Don Quixote, because it is the fox, not the hedgehog, who wants to write a novel.7 In Don Quixote, at the end of Part I, the Canon makes two long statements which pose in Renaissance terms a parallel to the remarks about realism Joyce made to Power. The first passage is the Canon's own injunction against the egotism of the writer which produces distortions and romance. Like Joyce, the Canon invokes the norm of nature; unlike Joyce, however, he can still invoke a community 3 A thorough discussion of Circe's anti-realism is contained in Marilyn French, The Book as World: James Joyce's Ulysses (Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England: Harvard University Press, 1976), pp. 185- 206.

DOODY THE IDEA OF REALISM of taste which makes the reader's own experience a standard of realism as well. "If you reply that the men who compose such books write them as fiction, and so are not obliged to look into fine points or truths, I should reply that the more it resembles the truth the better the fiction, and the more probable and possible it is, the better it pleases. Fictions have to match the minds of their readers, and to be written in such a way that, by tempering the impossibilities, moderating excesses, and keeping judgement in the balance, they may so aston- ish, hold, excite, and entertain, that wonder and pleasure go hand in hand. None of this can be achieved by anyone departing from verisimilitude or from that imitation of nature in which lies the perfection of all that is written. I have never seen a book of chivalry with a whole body for a plot, with all its limbs complete . ../ 8 This corporeal metaphor for a book's integrity is important because it affirms the physical norm of reality that Sancho uses to oppose the Don's romantic ascesis; and it looks toward one of Joyce's designs for keeping Ulysses "down to fact" by organizing the themes of each chapter according to a part of the body. The Canon also anticipates Joyce by apparently contradicting himself and defending the epic for the expressive latitude it gives the writer. Yet he continued that, for all that he had said against such books, he found one good thing in them: the fact that they offered a good intellect a chance to display itself. For they presented a broad and spacious field through which the pen could run without let or hindrance, describing shipwrecks, tempests, encounters and battles; painting a brave captain with all the features necessary for the part; . . . now depicting a tragic and lamentable incident, now a joyful and unexpected event; here a most beautiful lady, chaste, intelligent, and modest; there a Christian knight, valiant and gentle; in one place a monstrous, barbarous braggart; . . . Sometimes the writer might show his knowledge of astrology, or his excellence at cosmography or as a musician, . . . and he might even have an opportunity of showing his skill in necromancy. He could portray the subtlety of Ulysses, the piety of Aeneas, the valour of Achilles, . . .and, in fact, all those attributes which constitute the perfect hero, some- times placing them in one single man, at other times dividing them amongst many. . . . the loose plan of these books gives the author an opportunity of showing his talent for the epic, the lyric, the tragic and the comic, and all the qualities contained in the most sweet and pleasing sciences of poetry and rhetoric; for the epic may be written in prose as well as in verse. (426) This is a more generic, more modern theory, and even a description of many aspects of Ulysses. But this is only an accidental connection between two novels which are connected in so many other, more essential ways that they can stand 8Don Quixote, trans. J. M.

They share what all novels have: a definitive interest in the experience of the individual in a particular time and place; but they also share an unusual self-consciousness of their own relation to literature, a variety of styles that establishes a complicated satire, and a concern for the semantic distance between the word and the thing it names.9 Moreover, they suggest a general definition of realism, a generic idea, that is pertinent to explore because it contains three propositions about the novel which we must continue to acknowledge in our effort to establish the novel's poetics.'1 These propositions are that the novel is a thing-not the author's self- expression so much as it is an object in its own right; that this kind of objective artifact entails the notion of an impersonal artist; and, most important, that the novelist who wants to create a thing and remain impersonal will necessarily be willing to undermine, distribute, or share his own authority in order to define his meaning by the proposal of a consensus rather than by an appeal to some superior or antecedent norm. This last proposition also implies that the author will not even try to rely on the authority of the genre he uses, that he will try to say this thing is not merely a novel. Not every realistic novel will embody all of these propositions as clearly as Don Quixote and Ulysses do; and, in fact, not even Don Quixote and Ulysses embody all of them in the same way. In making the case I want to make about the idea of realism, it is not necessary to argue that Ulysses was intended as a thing because this is an idea about it we have acknowledged for some time. It is interesting and necessary, however, to show the reason Don Quixote is intended as a thing, just as it is to define the kind of realism in Joyce that can be taken for granted in Cervantes. The incongruity of even these two novels, moreover, is perfectly fitting, for the idea of realism that I want to define has to do with a novel's internal relationships and does not point to any particular consensus that all novels seek-not to the pastoral idea of harmony that John Loofbourow sees as the ground of the Anglo-American novel, and not merely to the rhetorical consensus that Wayne C. Booth recognizes in the meeting of every implied author and his reader." The consensus the realistic novel looks to is broader 9 These are the general criteria proposed by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Novel (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1964) and by Levin in The Gates of Horn. I am also indebted to Robert Scholes' and Robert Kellogg's The Nature of Narrative (London, Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1966), especially for the way in which they see Ulysses as an end; and to David Goldknopf's The Life of the Novel (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1972), especially for his fine first chapter. 10 It is interesting that no essay specifically on realism appears in the collection from Novel, which is entitled Towards a Poetics of Fiction (ed. Mark Spilka, Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1977). Realism is not an issue in Jonathan Culler's Structuralist Poetics (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1975). 11John W. Loofbourow, "Realism in the Anglo-American Novel: The Pastoral Myth," in The Theory of the Novel: New Essays, ed. John Halperin (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), pp. 257-270. Wayne C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1961). Booth, of course, is a great opponent of "objectivity," but his notion of fiction's rhetoric is basically an idea of realism that encourages a consensus. And The Rhetoric of Fiction contains a great deal of thinking on the nature and origin of objectivity. See also the section on "The Objective Artifact," in The Modern Tradi- tion, ed. Richard Ellmann and Charles Feidelson, Jr. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), for additional statements. 200</page><page sequence="5">TERRENCE A. DOODYITHE IDEA OF REALISM because it is one that tries to acknowledge the world's plurality and to give everything its due. Another way of saying this, which does apply to every novel, is that realism achieves its objectivity by recognizing the inviolable subjectivity of all its human characters, the potentially equal value and authority of every individual, the possibility of another point of view. Cervantes himself establishes a model of this attitude by giving his protagonist a partner who is quite different but ambiguously equal and not a mate.12 The fact that the Don and Sancho (like Stephen and Bloom) cannot resolve their differences sexually is important. For sexual couples like Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy, or Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, can embody the problem of knowledge at the heart of realism, but pairs of partners can keep these epistemological issues open and unaccommodated by emotional and institutional resolutions like marriage. So, the general narrator of Bleak House is a more equal and interesting partner to Esther Summerson than Allan Woodcourt or even Inspector Bucket is; and the tragedy of Anna Karenina seems harsher or more significant than Emma Bovary's because Anna is paired with Levin and set against his reasonably successful, open quest for life's meaning. Pairs of partners keep a balance, an open equilibrium, that resists both identifica- tion and an absolute. This equilibrium is at the center of the generic idea of realism that Don Quixote and Ulysses together suggest: realism is the idea that man and the world exist in a relationship of intelligibility. Under this idea, things are mean- ingful in themselves; they do not refer for their significance to some higher or ulterior principle; they are, rather, immediately accessible to man's intelligence and amenable to the meaning he discovers and creates. The idea of realism does not depend upon a particular ontological program, and it does not assume any particular theory of human character or knowledge. What this idea of realism does demand, though, is that the concept of character be commensurate with the theory of things. An imbalance in this relationship means that it is no longer realistic, that the literary situation is something else. For things which are not meaningful in themselves, or are not fully intelligible to man, but which embody some superior force or principle, such things are part of a relationship that is deterministic. There are deterministic principles that are religious and there are those that are secular, and the difference between them can be illustrated by Kafka's "The Metamorphosis." This story maintains all of the surface decorum we expect of realistic narrative, but the principle of Gregor Samsa's transforma- tion is never defined. If the reader decides the principle is religious in any way, then "The Metamorphosis" can be read as an allegory; if, however, the principle is secular, then things have the opacity or hostility we call naturalistic or absurd. 12 See Lowry Nelson, Jr., "Introduction," Cervantes: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Lowry Nelson, Jr., (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1969), p. 4. See also Edward Mendelson, "Gravity's Encyclo- pedia," in Mindful Pleasures: Essays on Thomas Pynchon, ed. George Levine and David Leverenz (Boston, Toronto: Little, Brown and Company, 1976).

On the other hand, things which are not meaningful in themselves because they are empty of intrinsic significance, or which have meaning only in man's presence and by his agency, and which offer no limits to his freedom, these things are the props of romance: like the moon in most lyric poems or the paper money is printed on. These things often figure in mythic narratives and in allegories of another kind, and they usually have a different relationship to time than the constituents of realism do. For the fact that things and men exist through time is also definitive of realism. Because things grow, change, decay, they can never be completely known because they can never be known at once; nor can man's intelligence claim any absolute authority when it is changing as the world is. So time itself, under this idea of realism, is the only absolute in so far as it is the ultimate limit of both knowledge and freedom: within time are the "imprevidibilities" of change,13 beyond it the mystery of death. The advantage of this idea of realism is that it is not limited to any particular metaphysics, nor to the style of realism of any particular nation or era; and it does not posit any single organizing idea of its own except that of the world's intelligibility to man's cognate intelligence, so it tries not to harbor any hier- archies. (And it is not perfect.) Harry Levin's elegant formulations clearly apply to the French novel more aptly than to the English; and Ian Watt's ideas of the eighteenth-century British novel work for much of the nineteenth-century British novel too, but the empiricism and rational psychology he uses to define Defoe and Richardson do not apply to Fielding exactly, much less to Dickens, and not at all to their modern heirs like Joyce and Lawrence who must include in their conception of character the unconscious. Yet Joyce and Lawrence, like Woolf and Faulkner, all now seem to us to be realistic, in at least the honorific sense in which we use that word, and it is important to realize that what once seemed strange, now seems true. And it does seem true because our sense of the world has changed with the changes in our sense of human nature. So, Lawrence's famous letter to Edward Garnett is an important example of the way in which character, the "old stable ego," can be redefined in a realistic way according to principles the author sees in the natural world, in things; as part of the world, the ego can have its deeper, allotropic states just as carbon can.l4 It has become a truism to remark that a scientific theory of the unconscious was developed in the same generation that physicists developed theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. But it is important to remark as well that as man has displaced more and more of the external world into himself, as he has seen more deeply into his own mind and nature, he has also discovered a greater depth and complexity in matter; and in both places, the center of the atom and the center of the uncon- scious, the laws of time are the same. Neither one is subject to the traditional, 13 See Ulysses, p. 696. "Imprevidibility" was coined by Joyce. 14 A fine discussion of this letter is Garrett Stewart, "Lawrence, 'Being,' and the Allotropic Style," in Towards a Poetics of Fiction.</page><page sequence="7">TERRENCE A. DOODYITHE IDEA OF REALISM "realistic" sense that time is linear and mechanical, and in neither place is the field of time eternal. The literary history of this appropriation of the world by the mind Erich Kahler has called "the inward turn of narrative," but this inward turn can also be figured as a fall. In Northrop Frye's scheme, it is the descent from the mythic and romantic through the high and low mimetic to the ironic; for John Loof- bourow, the shift is described in our belief that now the natural man is more authentic than the god or king.15 Yet whatever nostalgia we may feel for what we have supposedly lost, the idea of realism tried to compensate in the sense that we are also growing less estranged from the world we really occupy. In Stevens' words, we may be descending "downward to darkness, on extended wings," but The sky will be much friendlier then than now, A part of labor and a part of pain, And next in glory to enduring love, Not this dividing and indifferent blue. II Ulysses is at first hard to read because it is so thoroughly realistic; we are not prepared for an ordinary mind like Bloom's to be so spacious, nor for a world as small as DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN to be so rich in significant detail. Telemachus is a relatively easy, naturalistic beginning; the difficulties in Nestor are the ironic result of the characters' self-involvement; in Proteus, however, we begin to see the essence of the equilibrium that Joyce wants to maintain, his position that a human character is most himself not in any social relationship, but alone with his thoughts of the world. Stephen is the most alert and articulate exponent of this position because he is himself in the process of figuring it out, and his most dramatic attention to the world's readiness comes in the opening para- graphs of Proteus, when he is fully alone for the first time.

In fact, the only other determinant of meaning, balanced against a world meaningful in itself, is what we might call the ineluctable modality of the indi- vidual which Stephen formulates later in Scylla and Charybdis. This is the sub- jective complement of knowledge, the way in which the self imposes the meaning it may otherwise think it discovers, and also a principle which explains the individual self's variety, its own complement to the world's endless detail. He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend. Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meet- ing robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in- love. But always meeting ourselves. (213) Scylla and Charybdis, in its examination of theories of art, contains a number of ideas about the nature of Ulysses-explicitly in Stephen's theory of Shakespeare, implicitly in his theory of the incertitude of paternity and its relation to artistic creation (207), and offhandedly in such remarks as: "They remind one of don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr. Sigerson says" (192). Moreover, it contains even more explicitly than Proteus does Stephen's realization that the equilibrium he must maintain between the self and world is a relationship that exists in time. His opponents, like AE, insist that we are eternal essences and that the truth is too; against such an idealism, Stephen has to assert that his personal identity is temporal, that it is continuous despite its changes, and that it is not totally subject to mere circumstance. He says: Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got pound. Buzz. Buzz. But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms. (189) And later he adds: "As we, or mother Dana, weave or unweave our bodies, . . . so does the artist weave or unweave his image. . . . that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be" (194). As part of this intuition Stephen also realizes he is both the agent and the patient of his own life, and he says: "Act. Be acted on" (211), which on this day in particular is an important and complicated pair of imperatives. As W. J. Harvey says: "Novels which portray roughly the same equipoise between Self and World, which achieve the effect of conditional freedom that I have described, we may call realistic." 16 Bloom states his own version of these fundamental principles of the idea of 16 Character and the Novel (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1965), p. 133. 204</page><page sequence="9">TERRENCE A. DOODYITHE IDEA OF REALISM realism more laconically. He is less abstract than Stephen and more accommo- dated to the conditions of life, and much of what Stephen comes to formulate in a debate in the library Bloom arrives at on his way to lunch in Lestrygonians. The realistic relationship of intelligibility, which is subject to the changes of both man and the world in time, Bloom almost sums up in the word "Parallax" (154). His sense of his own identity he debates with: "I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? . . . Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us" (168, 169). This kind of distance on himself is a maturity or discipline that Stephen is not quite capable of, for he feels himself this day in too much pain, and he thinks, later in Wandering Rocks: "Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher, were the words. I say! Not yet awhile" (242). Stephen's reversion to religious belief for an Apocalyptic solution to his problem is not in keeping with the realism of Ulysses' first half, but it is appropriate to Wandering Rocks' overture to the second half and a clear foreshadowing of the moment in Circe when he smashes the chandelier with his ashplant and screams "Nothung!" (583). Bloom keeps a better balance between the human and the divine when he brackets his very poignant realization, "Me. And me now" (176), between his memory of the moment on Howth when he and Molly passed the seedcake to each other, a mo- ment she will remember in Penelope, and his resolution to investigate later at the library whether or not goddesses have anuses.17 The first half of Ulysses ends with the meeting of Bloom and Stephen on the library steps. Bloom has seen Stephen from the carriage in the Hades chapter, which is appropriate to the epic convention by which the hero foresees his future in his trip to the underworld.l8 But their actual meeting here is more important because it establishes them consciously in each other's world and predicts their common future. The scene begins in Stephen's mind as he is trying once again to get away from Mulligan: Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably. My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between. A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting. -Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.

(217) 17 On this point, as on many others, I am most indebted for my understanding of Ulysses to Richard Ell- mann's Ulysses on the Liffey (New York: Oxford University Press, 1972). 18 See R. M. Adams, "Hades," in James Joyce's Ulysses, p. 92, for a different opinion. 205</page><page sequence="10">NOVELISPRING 1979 Stephen's ironic prophecy that in meeting himself that night he will meet Bloom, "ineluctably," anticipates the narrative that will join them in Oxen of the Sun and keep them together until Stephen leaves from 7 Eccles Street in Ithaca. It also anticipates the elaborate rapproachment in Ithaca, where they become Stoom and Blephen (682), which parodies in the style of the catechism all of the realistic balances the novel sets up, all the symmetries between the mind and the world that the second half of the novel questions by its variety of styles. But most important here is the manifestation that Bloom and Stephen have had the same dream about an encounter in the street of harlots (see also 57 and 381). Molly will participate in this dream herself, both in the fantasia of Circe (439) and also in her monologue in Penelope (780). Now, the fact they have all had this dream seems to be more significant than the coincidence of Throw- away's victory that makes Bloom seem a prophet, and it also seems to be of an other order of being than the interpenetrations of Circe. In fact, their common dream suggests that the isolation each one of them feels in Proteus, Lestrygonians, and Penelope is not inescapable. While this isolation is fostered and reinforced by the stream-of-consciousness style that works best in a character's solitude, it is a style that also recognizes the independence of the world. And since the world itself contains other minds, its complete meaning has to come from a consensus in which others are acknowledged as equals and then joined. In Ulysses, not even in dreams can the individual alone claim authority, even for himself. In Don Quixote, dreams are equally important, but in a different way. Don Quixote is a book about books, so Cervantes assumes a stability about the world in order to measure certain questions of perception, which Joyce treats as resolved so that he, in turn, can use them to look back at the world. There is nothing in Don Quixote like the opening of Proteus because there does not have to be, and there is no book in Ulysses like Amadis de Gaul's or the texts of chivalry. When Don Quixote reads the windmills as giants, there is no question about his mistake; when Bloom walks through the meticulously recorded Dublin of 1904, there is no question he is also lisant au livre de lui-meme (187). Bloom, therefore, would never have the kind of problem the Don has with the dream he has had in the Cave of Montesinos. This experience is a singular adventure for the Don because it is not an illusion or "enchantment," but the one experience he has by himself which no one else witnesses and he cannot rationalize. Yet he is bothered by it so much that he seeks a confirmation for it later, a kind of consensus, when he tries to get Sancho to equate his experience in the cave with Sancho's own experience on the wooden horse Clavileno: "Sancho, if you want me to believe what you saw in the sky, I wish you to accept my account of what I saw in the Cave of Montesinos. I say no more" (735). The modesty of the favor the Don requests makes Sancho's refusal even more painful; for Sancho's story of what he saw in the sky, which plays the height of vision off the depth of dream here, is an elaborate, obsequious fabrication, designed to appeal to the Duke and Duchess who are toying with Don Quixote. Sancho could only have learned to make up a story like this from 206</page><page sequence="11">TERRENCE A. DOODYITHE IDEA OF REALISM the Don himself, and telling it makes him a fool in the eyes of the Court. The Don, however, is as simple and abashed as Sancho usually is, with no realization that his real dream is very different from Sancho's fake apology. And the dream remains so important to him that it is the only experience of his life that he repudiates on his deathbed (624), where it still seems to him a perversion because it was so authentically private and so unaccommodated by the conventions of chivalry under which he had organized the meaning of his life. His dream is a real experience, but Don Quixote has no idea by which he can "naturalize" it. It is his great irony that he always prefers the apparently realistic, as the conven- tion of chivalry would define it, to the actually real. Don Quixote makes its essential propositions about the idea of realism by making a continual inquiry into the differences between the real and the realistic, the thing itself and the ideas by which any thing is given meaning, value, or representation. The barber's basin which becomes the helmet of Mambrino is an obvious counterpoint to the adventure in the Cave of Montesinos, for it is an example of a consensus too easily arrived at, a convention too obviously dis- crepant with individual perception.19 In order to gull the Don and have some fun with the barber whose basin it is, the priest and the barber from La Mancha, Don Cardenio, Don Ferdinand, and his companions all agree that the basin is Mambrino's helmet. The incredulous barber says: 'Well, if this basin is a helmet, then, this pack-saddle must be a horse's harness, as this gentleman said.' 'It looks like a pack-saddle to me,' said Don Quixote, 'but, as I have already said, I am not interfering in that.' 'Whether it is a pack-saddle or a harness,' said the priest, 'Don Quixote has only to say; for in these matters of chivalry, all these gentlemen and myself defer to him.' (404) This scene shows the way in which a false consensus or a merely social consensus can become tyranny. It shows too what the Don loses when he does not have his usual passionate belief in what he is doing. When he has discussed the helmet of Mambrino earlier, on his own initiative and according to his own principles, he offers an explanation of its mysterious variety that does not denigrate the poten- tial good faith of anyone involved. "Is it possible that all this while you have been with me you have not discovered that everything to do with knights errant appears to be chimaera, folly and nonsense, and to all go contrariwise? This is not really the case, but there is a crew of enchanters always amongst us who change and alter all our deeds, and transform them according to their pleasure and their desire either to favour us or to injure us. So what seems to you to be a barber's basin appears to me 19 See Leo Spitzer, Linguistics and Literary History: Essays in Stylistics (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1948), pp. 41-86, for a different approach to Don Quixote's realism and a different evaluation of Cervantes' impersonality. 207</page><page sequence="12">NOVELISPRING 1979 to be Mambrino's helmet, and to another as something else. It shows a rare foresight in the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly Mambrino's helmet seem to everyone a basin" (204). The Don's explanation of the sage's foresight is not only one of the ways in which viewpoints other than his own are acknowledged, it is also one of those moments when the characters inside the book talk about the book itself, as though they actually are antecedent to it and independent: historical persons before they have become realistic characters. This trespass across ontological frontiers first occurs when Sancho calls Don Quixote the Knight of the Sad Countenance. He explains that "your worship has lately got the most dismal face I have ever seen. It must be either from weariness after the battle or from your worship's losing his teeth." 'It is from neither,' replied Don Quixote, 'but because the sage whose task it is to write the history of my deeds must have thought it right for me to take some title, as all knights did in the olden days. . . . That is why I say that the sage I mentioned has put it into your thoughts and into your mouth to call me now The Knight of the Sad Countenance. (147) What is wonderful about this preposterous explanation is that it is true.20 It does not obviate Sancho's explanation, which is also true in another way. And these complementary truths promote, even comically, the claim that the full truth of Don Quixote resides in its proposal of a consensus that does not violate anyone's individual perception or refer to only one source of authority. Not even to Cervantes himself, who is and is not the sage, for he treats the book as Don Quixote treats the book-as a thing apart from himself, an object. For the Don, the history the sage writes is an objectification of his most fantastic ideas of himself, his most subjective longings; and this reification that confirms the meaning of his life as a knight errant is the necessary premise on which Part II becomes possible. Part I is picaresque and centrifugal: Don Quixote wanders out to encounter the world. Part II is centripetal and more realistic: it criticizes the false history written as a sequel to Part I, and it presents the Don as a celebrity whom others now seek out. Although he has an itinerary, which includes the Cave of Montesinos, in Part II the world comes to Don Quixote to enter the circle of enchantment that he has created by the intensity of his own idea of himself. And however ironic or condescending they are about their motives to be included in the next installment of the history, figures like the Duke and Duchess confirm the Don's idea of himself by playing his game on his field. Their court is not the Cave. By the same token, the thingness of Don Quixote itself, its existence as a text or object, guarantees Cervantes that his fiction is not like the Don's self-delusions and uncertifiable dreams, and Cervantes goes to some lengths to reify his book 20 See also Cardenio's remark on p. 267: "It is so strange and rare that I do not know whether anyone trying to invent such a character in fiction would have the genius to succeed." 208</page><page sequence="13">TERRENCE A. DOODYITHE IDEA OF REALISM in order to distance himself from creatures he does not claim. Cide Hamete Benengeli is always presented as the author of this history; and between Cide Hamete and Cervantes, who says he is its "step-father" (and who acts like its "stylist"), there are at least two translators, one of whom is hired on the spot when Cervantes finds a part of the manuscript in the Alacana at Toledo (76). This fragment contains pictures of Don Quixote and Rocinante (77), and Cer- vantes gives the manuscript even greater historicity by including himself within it as the author of Galatea (62) and as the almost unidentified heroic rebel of "The Captive's Tale" (355). In this way, Don Quixote is given the same ontologi- cal status Cervantes has as an historical figure, and the various narrators of the interpolated tales, the translators and commentators Cervantes is always referring to as his sources, are treated as his equals too, for they have become his col- laborators. They are to Cervantes what the Duke and Duchess are to the Don: confirmation that Don Quixote is more like a windmill than a giant, a thing rather than a romance. In Cervantes's Theory of the Novel, E. C. Riley says: "Cervantes handles his work in such a way as to show his complete control over the creation he tries so hard to make seem independent." 21 But Cervantes' control is not what is most interesting here: it is exactly what we expect from art. What is interesting is his effort to make it seem not his, to resolve his artistry away and make his book seem life's. This is the effect, I think, of reading Penelope after the self-conscious literature of the preceding chapters: in Molly's artless words, Joyce gives his book back to life. And the attitude he shares with Cervantes, that a univocal authority is less valuable and true than the experience of multiplicity, is at the heart of their common idea of realism. III In The Situation of Poetry, Robert Pinsky claims that the tradition of the "per- sona," "a borrowed voice or alter-identity, as speaker or central character partly distinct from the poet, constitutes one of the most widely-noted, perhaps over- emphasized, critically chewed, and fundamental aspects of modernism. . . . And 'the speaker' as a method stands in clear logical relation to the modernist goal of moving the poem away from the abstraction of statement, toward the being of an object." 22 It seems, however, that this idea of impersonality is, generally, a modern idea, which is not limited merely to modernism and which has been a natural resource and goal of realistic novelists since the time of Cervantes. Yet I don't think it is over-emphasized because it is an idea that has had so many different intentions. Joyce, for instance, seems to have wanted the per- vasive, invisible, God-like presence of the dramatist, whereas Eliot wanted both an escape from emotion and a discipline before he got religion. But Yeats wanted to complete or fulfill his identity in the "double" or "anti-self" he defines in 91 Cervantes's Theory of the Novel (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962), p. 41. 22 The Situation of Poetry (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1976), p. 14. 209</page><page sequence="14">210 NOVELISPRING 1979 "Ego Dominus Tuus," and Wallace Stevens, in poems like "The Snow Man," wanted to keep himself from solipsism and anthropomorphic distortions by maintaining a perfect metonymic balance with the landscape.23 One of the most interesting versions of the idea was Brecht's, who had the impersonality of the ideologue to add to that of the dramatist, but who also wanted to impose it as a condition on the audience. Still, Wayne C. Booth's objections to the idea of impersonality are given an unintended ratification in the claim Hugh Kenner makes that Pound practiced translation to purge "the contingencies of a person- ality partly private (Hailey, Idaho; Hamilton College), partly public (the legacy of Rossetti, the emotional climate of 1900-12) but in any case irrelevant to the fulness of poetic achievement." 24 This is a fairly ruthless formulation that suggests a personality purged of its contingencies and therefore reduced to its necessary reality may be capable of authenticity and objectivity only at the physiological level.25 A much more humane defense of the ideal comes from Marx, in the "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts," when he explains how the objectification of the self in a piece of work not only confirms the self, but affirms as well its essentially communal nature. Supposing that we had produced in a human manner; each of us would in his production have doubly affirmed himself and his fellow men. I would have: (1) objectified in my production my individuality and its peculiarity and thus both in my activity enjoyed an individual expression of my life and also in looking at the object have had the individual pleasure of realizing that my personality was objective, visible to the senses and thus a power raised beyond all doubt. (2) In your enjoyment of use of my product I would have had the direct enjoyment of realizing that I had both satisfied a human need by my work and also objectified the human essence and therefore fashioned for another human being the object that met his need. (3) I would have been for you the mediator between you and the species and thus been acknowledged and felt by you as a completion of your own essence and a necessary part of yourself and have thus realized that I am confirmed both in your thought and in your love. (4) In my expression of my life I would have fashioned your expression of your life, and thus in my own activity have realized my own essence, my human, my communal essence.26 We do not have to claim for this passage that it contains a theory of reading in 2: Metonymy as a principle of realism is the insight of Roman Jakobson's "The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles," in Critical Theory Since Plato, ed.

DOODYITHE IDEA OF REALISM order to say that it implies a condition of the novel that we often ignore: whereas poems are often songs, and plays are performances, novels are things we must hold in our hands to read. And in such a thing, Marx argues, is objectified not only the individual being of the writer and reader, but also what Marx calls the "species-being" of each: not only the singularity of an individual identity, but its intrinsic multiplicity as well. This notion of the self's variety is important to the idea of realism and its proposal of a consensus because it means that the writer who does not want to speak in propria persona is not confined to a single other voice and that the voices he does use are not merely prosthetic devices, but real extensions of himself, part of his human nature. When Don Quixote says: 'I know who I am, . . . and I know, too, that I am capable of being not only the characters I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and all the Nine Worthies as well, for my exploits are far greater than all the deeds they have done, all together and each by himself.' (54) he gives a comic correlative to Cervantes' use of so many different translators, commentators, and narrators; and he emphasizes that both he and his author are distributing themselves throughout their various roles quite deliberately and responsibly. Not all the role-playing in Don Quixote is so responsible; in fact, the moral lesson of one of the longest and best of the interpolated tales, "The Tale of Foolish Curiosity," is that the actor must guard against being overtaken by his act, that he must not lose himself. This moral aspect of role-playing is not a problem for Joyce. The variety of his obvious presence throughout the second half of Ulysses, after his magisterial invisibility throughout all the first half but Aeolus, is an easy demonstration of one of the principles of modernism Stevens epitomizes in the "Adagia": "A change of style is a change of subject." 27 The pun on subject is important, of course, but it should not distract us from the fact that Joyce's virtuosity expresses quite directly his sense of what it means to be human. When he discussed the Ulysses theme with Frank Budgen and George Borach, he emphasized both Ulysses' humanity and his fullness, the variety of his roles, until the two seemed to mean the same thing. This long passage, which Richard Ellmann quotes from Borach's journal, should recall to us both the Canon's remarks in Don Quixote about the expressive latitude the epic offers a writer and Stephen's remarks in Scylla and Charybdis that "We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love. But always meet- ing ourselves." I. I. thinks: 'The most beautiful, all-embracing theme is that of the Odyssey. It is greater, 27 Opus Posthumous, ed. Samuel French Morse (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1966), p. 171. In "The Noble Rider and the Sound of Words," Stevens also briefly adumbrates a theory of realism like the one I have proposed here; in the remarks he makes about the pressure of reality and the resistance offered by the imagination, he also sounds like Stephen Dedalus, in Wandering Rocks, between two roaring worlds.

The rejuvena- tion of old Faust has an unpleasant effect upon me. Dante tires one quickly, it is like looking at the sun. The most beautiful, most human traits are contained in the Odyssey. I was twelve years old when we took up the Trojan War at school; only the Odyssey stuck in my memory. I want to be frank; at twelve I liked the supernaturalism in Ulysses. When I was writing Dubliners I intended at first to choose the title Ulysses in Dublin, but gave up the idea. In Rome, when I had finished about half the Portrait, I realized that the Odyssey had to be the sequel, and I began to write Ulysses. 'Why was I always returning to this theme? Now in mezzo del cammin I find the subject of Ulysses the most human in world literature. Ulysses didn't want to go off to Troy; he knew that the official reason for the war, the dissemination of the culture of Hellas, was only a pretext for the Greek merchants, who were seeking new markets. When the recruiting officers arrived, he happened to be plowing. He pretended to be mad. Thereupon they placed his little two-year-old son in the furrow. Observe the beauty of the motifs: the only man in Hellas who is against the war, and the father. Before Troy the heroes shed their life- blood in vain. They want to raise the siege. Ulysses opposes the idea. [He thinks up] the stratagem of the wooden horse. After Troy there is no further talk of Achilles, Menelaus, Agamemnon. Only one man is not done with; his heroic career has hardly begun: Ulysses. 'Then the motif of wandering. Scylla and Charybdis-what a splendid parable. Ulysses is also a great musician; he wishes to and must listen; he has himself tied to the mast. The motif of the artist, who will lay down his life rather than renounce his interest. Then the delicious humor of Polyphemus. "Outis is my name." On Naxos, the oldster of fifty, perhaps baldheaded, with Nausicaa, a girl who is barely seventeen. What a fine theme! And the return, how profoundly human! Don't forget the trait of generosity at the interview with Ajax in the nether world, and many other beautiful touches. I am almost afraid to treat such a theme; it's overwhelming.' "It is not surprising," Ellmann comments, "that Joyce's description of Ulysses as pacifist, father, wanderer, musician, and artist, ties the hero's life closely to his own." 28 I think it is no coincidence, either, that a writer so noted for his impersonality would appreciate in a character so favored for his multiplicity the statement, "Outis is my name." For the tie between Joyce and Ulysses that is most important is the one between Ulysses as a model and Joyce as the creator of Bloom. It is obvious we are supposed to see Bloom as a father and a son, husband and lover, pacifist, wanderer, inventor, companion, figure of the artist, and good gentle man. It is also important we see him eating and sleeping, going in Calypso and coming in Nausicaa, at work and at large, through his own eyes and through the eyes of other Dubliners. For in seeing him through Joyce's eyes, we often 28 James Joyce (New York, London, Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1959), p. 430.

DOODY THE IDEA OF REALISM see him as he cannot see himself, in Sirens and Oxen of the Sun, for instance, as well as in Circe and Ithaca. These seem not to be realistic chapters in the way Nausicaa and Penelope are because there is in them no more equilibrium between Bloom's intelligence and the intelligibility of the world he is in. He "contains" Lestrygonians beautifully; it is, in fact, one of the novel's great chapters because so much is said so artlessly. But there is no way he can be said to contain even his own identity in Oxen of the Sun, nor that even his unconscious can hold all the phenomena of Circe. And were he allowed somehow to read Ulysses, there are parts he would not be able to recognize as his own experience as well as even more parts, probably, that he simply wouldn't get.29 This same lack of comprehension can be attributed to many other characters central to the modern novel, yet these characters, like Lawrence's Brangwens or Faulkner's Bundren family, do not now seem unrealistic to us. We have grown to accept them, and other characters like them, as we have grown to accept ideas about human nature that exclude parts of our being from our own self- consciousness or aspects of our most basic experience from the reach of language. In doing so, we have also come to accept the necessity of omniscient authors who make no final claims for their omniscience, who in fact try to disguise or deny it by dealing it away. No one has done this more adamantly than Faulkner has, except Joyce, perhaps, throughout the chapters of Ulysses' second half. Whether we want to say that the different styles of Sirens and Circe amount to different "characters" of the narrative (as the narrator of Cyclops in particular seems to be), or that they are rather different aspects of Joyce himself, which I think is simpler and makes more sense, the fact remains that no one of them is given a superior claim. The style of Sirens is not truer than the style of Cyclops; the prose of Nausicaa is not less "Joycean" than that of his favorite chapter, Ithaca. Joyce does not distribute himself throughout Moorish historians and interpolated reconteurs, but he achieves the same value by adopting for himself a series of identities in Ulysses as easily, as fluently, as Stephen adopts new identities for him- self in Proteus, with little more but with nothing less than the change of style that amounts to a change of subject.30 Not every one of these last nine chapters of Ulysses is realistic by any definition, but all the chapters together are faithful to realism's commitment to the truth based upon a consensus of equal individual principles. And while it would be hard to draw a simple consensus from what these last nine chapters say about the self and the world, it is easier now to grant that when Joyce said, "In my Mabbot Street scene, I approached reality closer in my opinion than anywhere else in the book except perhaps for moments in the last chapter," he was defining his idea of realism quite exactly: posing his opinion at the moment against the objectified body of his work and one of his styles 2U See Richard Poirier, "The Importance of Thomas Pynchon," in Mindful Pleasures, p. 21, for more on who is fit in modern literature to read the books they appear in. There are no more Don Quixotes, who may be the father of the novel because he was so great a reader. 30 See J. Mitchell Morse, "Proteus," in James Joyce's Ulysses, pp. 29-50, who has many important things to say about the ideas of identity and time and about the connections between Proteus and the last nine chapters. I also want to remark on behalf of my conclusions about Ulysses that the very existence of a book like this, with one critic for each chapter of the novel, also argues for the principle of consensus. 213</page><page sequence="18">NOVEL|SPRING 1979 against another, claiming nothing absolute for any of them, and leaving an exact definition of "reality" just out of reach. IV The polarity intrinsic to the idea of realism, the equilibrium that realistic novels try to maintain, is a recognition of the essentially equal but contending claims that issue from, and yet also bind together, the self and the world, the author and his work, one character and another, the narrator and the reader, readers and their experience. In order to acknowledge all of these relationships and to give them a form, Cervantes and Joyce, who represent a beginning and an end of the novel's most self-conscious tradition, each tried to present his novel as a thing; and then from this thing, each also tried to efface himself in order not to impose a single standard of authoritative meaning. In doing so, each has distributed himself among many different points of view, which is the literary strategy by which they recognize both the great variety of human experience and the possible multiplicity within each individual self. Meaning, they propose, arises from a consensus; identity, they imply, is actually legion. In doing this, they demon- strate how important the anti-authoritarian nature of realism has been to the modern world, and they explain why the correlative of narrative impersonality has been the idea of selflessness that moved Lionel Trilling to call the novel "the literary form to which the emotions of understanding and forgiveness were indigenous, as if by definition of the form." 31 Realism evokes selflessness as an ideal because it is so essentially committed to the value of individuality, to the fullness and freedom of every individual, that it can also comprehend its own limit. For this reason, if for no other, the idea of realism is still necessary to maintain and defend in a world where things and other ideas proliferate so rapidly that a single governing idea, a univocal system of any kind, is seductively restful, reductive, annihilating. There is about the idea of realism a modesty that characterizes Bloom's deference to Stephen and Sancho's to the Don, but this same modesty promotes their survival and suggests that these two shall inherit the world where, as William Carlos Williams says, so much depends upon a red wheel barrow glazed with rain water beside the white chickens. al "Manners, Morals, and the Novel," The Liberal Imagination (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday-Anchor Inc., 1953), p. 215. 214</page></plain_text>
