<plain_text><page sequence="1">126 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW means by which the distinction between slave and free was uncomfortably maintained. The book insists on the instability of the slave/free dichotomy - never as clear as the free would have liked. It pervades, for example, ancient views on the veracity of evidence produced by slaves under torture; speakers may insist that 'no statements made as a result of basanos [of slaves] have ever been proved to be untrue' (e.g. Dem. 30.37), and yet Aristotle's Rhetoric equips the student speaker with arguments to challenge such a supposition (1376b-1377a). Antiphon's fifth oration even comes close to articulating duBois' own conviction, namely that the ' evidence' produced by the tortured is largely dependent on the identity of the torturers and the ' truth' they wish to extract (5.31-2, 5). In nature no physical mark distinguishes slave from free. The violability of the servile body- its vulnerability to assault and 'inscription' by scars left by torture, whippings, brandings and tattoes - was therefore a crucial signifier of its social status. duBois finds illumination in J.-P. Sartre's remarks on torture by the French in Algeria; Algeria could not 'contain two human species', but 'required a choice between them'. The relationship of torturer to tortured, now as then, is a bloody paradigm of a socio-political hierarchy, an atrocious marker of the subordination of one group by another.' Torturability creates a difference which is naturalized' (p. 62). This passionately committed polemic scrupulously avoids sensationalism of its repellant subject-matter. It is a brave attempt to make Classical Antiquity pertinent to the contemporary world. But ultimately the argument is no less 'Eurocentric' than Foucault's. If we are to believe it then Westerners can blame their history of torture on the conceptual legacy of Classical Athens, but unfortunately for duBois' argument, and for humankind, torture and 'truth' have been conceptually interconnected, throughout recorded history, well beyond the parameters of European influence. University of Reading ED I TH HAL L CYPRIOT TOMBS PAVLOS FLOURENTZOS: Excavations in the Kouris Valley, Vol. I: The Tombs. With Appendix by J. Manolis. Pp. ix+71; 13 figures, 9 tables, 48 plates. Nicosia, Cyprus: Republic of Cyprus, Ministry of Communication and Works, Department of Antiquities, 1991. The Department of Antiquities, Cyprus, has an enviable record for well planned and published research excavations; it has also always responded positively to the demands of rescue archaeology, undertaking consequential intensive field surveys and emergency excavations, publishing the results either in RDAC or, as here, in Department monographs. In recent years there have been large scale rescues in the vicinity of ancient Amathus, and at Nea Paphos. Scarcely less demanding was the great dam in the Kouris river valley, N of Kourion, for the area is rich in ancient sites, many of them first identified in the course of rescue work. Chief among these is the complex of Late Cypriot settlements close to Alassa (Hadjisavvas in RDAC 1986, 95-108). This volume publishes fifteen tombs dug between 1986 and 1988 by F. near the villages of Kandou and Alassa (or Khalassa, according to the old orthography of the Department of Land Registration and Surveys- see also J. C. Goodwin, A Toponymy of Cyprus2, 1977, s.v. 'Khalassa') seven and twelve miles N of Kourion ? Oxford University Press 1993</page><page sequence="2">127 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW respectively. F. is to be congratulated for maintaining his Department's record for prompt publication. After referring in his Introduction to earlier chance finds made in the vicinity (including a Phoenician dipinto from a looted tomb at Kalaouzou [BCH 91 (1967), 302]) F. gives an illustrated account of his own tombs, which vary in date from Middle Cypriot (MC) to Early Hellenistic (EHL), the majority being Cypro-Archaic (CA). Five tombs (all CA) were found 1500-2500 m. N of Kandou, the rest within a kilometre of one another, close to Alassa. F. explains that other tombs were dug by colleagues, and refers, for instance, to BCH 111 (1987), 728ff., where several of these are briefly mentioned, and objects of particular interest illustrated. Two CA I tombs from Alassa, Kambos (Ts. 9 and 11) have been published by S. Hadjisavvas, RDAC 1989, 95-108 (not mentioned by F.). V. Karageorghis published a fine CA pictorial jug from here in RDAC 1987, 99-100, pls. 34, 35.2- mention could also have been made of the important CA I pictorial vase published by Karageorghis in Rivista di Studi Fenici ii.2 (1974), 161-5, said to be from Kandou. It is much to be regretted that the whole Alassa-Kandou tomb-material could not have been presented under one cover, thereby providing a more balanced account of the region's archaeology. (It is clear, for instance, from BCH 111 that Kandou, Anatolia T.1 3 dates to the HL and Roman periods, unlike the other material presented here, all CA.) Presentation, in the main, follows the Department's standard practice, itself quite closely modelled on the SCE method of presentation. After a (too) brief description of find circumstances comes a catalogue of grave goods, a section on chronology, and comment. The Table of Contents provided for most tombs is useful. Thirteen of the 48 plates show finds in situ; these are not especially informative, and there is some duplication (e.g. P1. III, 1 and 2; III, 3 and 4; IV, 1 and 2; VI, 1 and 2; X, 2 and 3). A majority of the finds is illustrated by photographs, the reproduction of which is not as good as recently published illustrations of comparable material- cf. e.g. RDAC 1987, pls. XXVI-XXXII; RDAC 1989, pls. XI-XX. Pottery drawings are confined to one plate of MC pieces and a second, of unusual CA items. The brief Conclusions emphasize points of interest revealed by the excavation. The CA pottery, for instance, shows influence from both Amathus and Kourion (note, however, that Hadjisavvas (RDAC 1989, 107) found strong influence from Palaepaphos in his Alassa tombs). There are a few Phoenician imports, which help to explain the Phoenicianizing traits of some of the pottery. More could have been made of the four vases with pictorial ornament- two squat jugs of J. L. Benson's Amathus Workshop (Alassa T5:4 and T18:17) and two (fragmentary) Bichrome Red oinochoai, one with a sphinx, the other an agrimi on their shoulders (Alassa 7: 1 and 18: 38). The interest of the two last is heightened by Karageorghis' note on another, finer piece from Kouklia, Skales T94, RDAC 1987, 88 and n. 12. Despite the great richness of CA pictorial vase- painting (see especially V. Karageorghis and J. des Gagnieres, La Ceramique Chypriote de Style Figure [Rome, 1974]; idem. Supplement [Rome, 1979]), very few pieces had previously been found in context (in his definitive account of the Amathus Workshop in RDAC 1982, 138-43, Benson lists more than 50 vases, none of which appears to have been found in a carefully observed context). This is certainly a useful publication of source-material; it is valuable to have such a complex of finds from a locality previously little explored archaeologically. At a time of growing interest in, and understanding of Bronze Age regionalism in Cyprus the publication of the MC Alassa T1 is opportune to add to what is known of Helen Herscher's South Coast Fabrics (RDAC 1976, 11-19). But improvements could be suggested. Not enough is said of the circumstances of discovery, particularly about</page><page sequence="3">128 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW the topography of the cemeteries, or of individual tombs. The absence of contour- lines or spot-heights on the area plan, Fig. 3, is symptomatic - F. could usefully have followed the style of S. Hadjisavvas' Alassa area-plans in RDAC 1986 and 1989. While it is understandable that there are no plans for some of the looted tombs (nine of the 15 were looted or partly disturbed), it is surprising there are no plans of the unpillaged Alassa T5 and its 48 finds or Kandou T 22 and its 145 objects. More attention should be given to stratigraphy, vertical and horizontal, in individual tombs to try to determine whether burials were made simultaneously or successively, and to isolate groups of material within individual tombs, groups which might help discriminate ceramic development within the CA period more subtly. By oversight, 23 of the 26 items found inside the White Painted IV amphora Kandou T22:97 remain unidentified- a golden opportunity for recognizing a neatly closed group is thereby missed. The account of the MC Alassa T1 is similarly incomplete, for none of the 75 finds (including the very remarkable stone stamp-seal pl. XIV. 1) is attributed to any of the three chambers of which, it seems, the tomb consisted. F. dates the whole of this complex to MC II; without knowing what was found with what, it is difficult to know what to make of this material, though, to be sure, nos. 14 and 21, at least, look earlier than MC II. Some minor points - Alassa Tl: 13 is a 'dipper' or 'scoop' rather than a 'ladle'. Can Alassa T1:39 really be called anthropomorphic? The 'lids' of Alassa T4 (la, 5a, 6a) are 'stoppers'. Alassa T5:17, 18 and 24 are not 'carinated' - F.'s use of the term is incorrect elsewhere, too. The bowl type Alassa T5:8, said to be common at Amathus, is similarly common in the Turabi Tekke tombs at Larnaka. Reference is made to the ' great number of sherds' found in the looted tombs Alassa 7 and 10, but no evaluation of this material is made. The sphinx on Alassa 7:1 and the agrimi on Alassa 18: 38 are ' striding', not ' galloping'. The bronze and iron fibula Alassa 13:1 should have been compared to the rather larger Kouklia, Skales T94: 4, and Karageorghis' detailed note on it RDAC (1987), 89 n. 38. Alassa T13:23 (plain 'crater') can have nothing to do with Late Bronze Age craters. Kandou T22:56 and 70 are ' stamnoi' rather than ' dinoi'. The ship said to be engraved on T22:83 (p. 60, fig. 12) needs more support for the identification to be credible. The scale on the photograph of the scarab T22:136 suggests it is 5.0 cms long - the catalogue entry gives 1.5 cms as its length (this piece ought to have been drawn). The stone tools Alassa T18:12 and Kandou T22:86 are more likely to have been left behind by the workmen who cut the tombs than to be grave-gifts. A Bibliography (especially of excavations, etc., in the area of the Kouris dam) and an Index would have been welcome. There are numerous misprints. Langford H. W.
