<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES' THEORY OF THE NEGATION OF PRIVATION' Z. DIESENDRUCK The problem of the divine attributes in Jewish Philosophy had-besides its own importance for the purifying of the God concept-another additional significance: it afforded a major occasion for epistemological speculation - and especially for speculation concerning the border-questions of human cognition. In this two-fold respect also we have to examine Maimonides' contribution in his theory of attributes, and especially in the term coined by him and put in the centre of his theory, namely the term: the negation of privation, rnYiln rnl'w (n-ry ::D).2 It is a peculiar fate of an idea, that, during all the centuries following Maimonides, a twofold injustice has been done him in regard to this theory: he was given credit for what he did not teach, nay for that which he expressly opposed, and, on the other hand, his real, unique contribution remained unknown. He is generally given credit3 for the so-called "negative attri- butes" in the meaning that since we cannot attribute to God positive qualities, because this would lead to anthropomorphism, plurality, etc., we have to understand the essential attributes only as forms of negations; the attribute "mighty" must be understood as "not-weak," "wise" as "not ignorant" and so on; or, in another formulation, if we say "mighty" we mean "mighty without might," that is to say: the quality of might is not to be regarded as separate from God's essence and added to him, which again would result in plurality. These ideas are usually presented as Maimonides' new theory of the "negative attributes." This paper is a chapter of a more inclusive study. 2 More Nebukim (Wd. Wilna) I 58, p. 86b; Munk, Guide I, p. y b. 3 Cf., e.g., Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attributenlehre, p. 422 f., esp. pp. 428 f. 139</page><page sequence="2">DIESENDRUCK But this theory is neither new nor is it that of Maimonides. There is hardly any idea or term about which there is so much consensus among the philosophers-from Mukkammaz4 and Bachya5 to Ibn Zaddik,6 Halevi7 and Ibn Daud,8 so different otherwise-as about the idea of the negative attributes as described above and also called distinctly by this name. In fact the entire idea is to be found in a quite developed form in the Kalam.9 Maimonides' hesitancy and his repeated emphasis upon the difficulty of the matter (esp. in M. N. I, 57), also the fact that he introduces the two main chapters dealing with this point (M. N. I 57, 58) by the remarks "more recondite than the preceding"--mlpn 1 piy nim--all this would certainly be out of place if what he had to teach was the commonplace of the negative attributes. We find, moreover, in ch. 60 that when arguing with those who assert positive attributes (D'nnzI= DnrT1N) he tries to show them that they, too, have to arrive at negations resulting from homonymity-negations which resemble the typi- cal negations quoted above. These negations are those which even they could not escape-but certainly not his. Also his contention in the same chapter that every predication involves duality, at least duality in definition--nnm Dow-of the subject and the predicate, would apply just as well to the negative attribute if it was only a double-negation (God is not not wise) which essentially amounts to an affirmative predication. There must, then, be an element in his type of negation which saves it from being exposed to the contention regarding duality. We have therefore to undertake a closer analysis of his theory of negative attributes as developed chiefly in chs. 57 and 58- after the preceding discussion of the attributes of action.

In both chapters he takes the commonplace negations as his point of departure but turns immediately into another direction. In 57 he starts out with that variant of negative attribute which is still positive in form; namely "living without life," "one without unity"-the old Kalam formula designed to save the true unity of God and still retain the plurality of attri- butes. Right here Maimonides gives the added negation a privative character. "One without unity" means that when we say one in order to exclude many we mean to exclude quantity altogether, so that, in the last analysis, one, being also a term of quantity, is just as inapplicable as many. He gives as examples sweetness of which we can neither say "crooked" nor "straight" or the voice, and the two predicates "salted" or "insipid." In other words: when we say one, we mean not "not many" but "non many," i. e., many, as a term of quantity cannot at all be predicated of him; this of course applies just as well to one. The negation is turned into a privation. The difference between the negative and the infinite or priva- tive proposition-known to Aristotle?o and well developed in Stoic logic,"-depends upon the object of the negation. In the negative proposition the negation attacks the copula, while in the infinite proposition the copula remains affirmative but the predicate is negative; A is not B is a negative proposition, A is non-B is an infinite proposition. Although the name infinite as used by BoethiusI2 may have been a mistake for indefiniteI3-it is now, since KantI4 used it for the third in the group of the categories of quality, well established. It is infinite, because it eliminates from the infinite number of possible predicates only one, so that the infinity remains untouched. Its meaning there- fore is only that of limitation.

The proposition therefore "The voice is not salted," a negative proposi- tion, would only deny an otherwise possible predicate, while the proposition "The voice is non-salted" expresses a privation, that the predicate salted can never apply to voice. Now it is the same that Maimonides claims for the proposition "God is not many" -namely that the term "many" as a term of quantity never can apply to God. But this is no less true with the term "one," which is also a term of quantity and hence not predicable of God; we could then -in order to deny predicability of quantity altogether-just as well say "God is many without plurality" and the result would be the same as when we say "one without unity." This is indeed where Ch. 57 leaves us. It introduced privation without making productive use of it. The result would be a sort of nescience, at best a docta ignorantia. The God concept would be free of corporeality, plurality and all the rest of the anthropomorphistic elements but it would also be empty of all that which gives meaning to it altogether. Because the attri- butes of action, too, need a source, an agent which cannot be expressed in mere privations. Maimonides could by no means be satisfied with the mere privative precautions for attributes such as Will, Wisdom, Knowledge which constitute the very essentials of his system.'6 Therefore the next step, in ch. 58, was to determine more exactly the direction of the privation. We saw that for the purpose of ch. 57 the attribute "not one" or "plural without plurality" would have been just as good as "one without unity" -because it would in general express the privation of quantity. Now the direction of the denial becomes limited only to one way: only against privatives; if we say "one" we want to exclude Is Logik II, pp. 284 f.; Encyclopddie ?173.-Cf.

Our purpose is not merely strengthening homonymity in a general manner but the nega- tion of very definite privatives--nrymnn nrw. We deny non- wisdom, non-unity, non-might, etc.; we cannot, for the sake of eliminating the entire class of predicates, do the reverse. And so we arrive, in this second stage, at the other traditional variant of the negative attributes-the variant of "wise =not ignorant," "mighty =not weak"-but also this variant, as did the previous, serves only as a starting point for a new development. The beginning of ch. 58 sounds as if the discussion in 57- where the attributes were still positive in their form-were dropped entirely; as the only possible attributes are introduced those in negative form. But we shall see later that the results of 57 are fruitful also after the new developments of ch. 58. Two points there are which Maimonides intends to develop in this chapter according to his introductory remarks: 1) that the negative attributes are attributes to a certain extent (i. e., that they are not mere nescience). 2) that only the negative form is adequate for our purpose.'7 In developing the first point he takes up, as said before, the second variant of the negative attributes, the commonplace- formula "wise = not ignorant," "mighty=not weak." He modi- fies these formulae however by designating the denied qualities as privations (mlqiyn).i8 Ignorance is absence of wisdom, weak- ness is absence of might-this in accordance with his well-known stand19 in reference to all evil and deficiencies that-in opposi- tion to the Kalam-they have no existence but are merely absence of existent properties, privations. By this designation the negative attribute becomes immediately highly positive in 17 More p. 85a (Guide p. y a): D', n ID on 1, n;nn '1 -w=a (,mni) I1'= -K 1?5 lo:K -i Nnm ....

When we say therefore "not weak" it means not non-mighty. It has therefore not merely the negative effect of excluding weakness, or igno- rance, etc., from the field of possible predicates but it has the positive effect of including the contradictory opposites, namely, might, wisdom, etc., within that field of possible predicates. This is a great step farther than the purely negative attribute. This form of negation of privation, being positive in effect, has therefore much in common with the positive attributes, inas- much as both are capable of particularizing the subject. It is not a negation at large but an exclusion of definite contradictory opposites, of "what otherwise would not be excluded."20 Comparing the situation with that of ch. 57 we find, that whereas in ch. 57 it was a privation of a general class of predi- cates, such as quantity, temporality, etc., we have here the negation of privations which do not represent the entire class but a part, the privative part, of it. In 57 we had an affirmative infinite proposition, A is non-B, but while positive in its form it is negative in significance. Here we have a negative infinite proposition (with a more limited predicate), but while negative in its form it is positive in its import.-The meaning of an infinite proposition, A is non-B, is the elimination of B from the field of the infinite number of possible predicates for A; what is left is infinite, the elimination has only a negative effect. The nega- tive infinite proposition, on the other hand, A is not non-B, is the undoing of that elimination, it returns the predicate B into the field of the possible predicates of A; it has therefore a positive effect. And yet it is not, like the double negation, a positive predicate, because it does not by neutralization attribute any- thing positively to the substance of A, it only adds to the field of the predicates of A, not to A itself. But still the epistemological gain even through the negation of privation or the negative infinite proposition is not great. 20 Morep. 85b(Guide p.yb): Dm,' in i ,nn nD m D =1WW n monD -1' n m 3 n D KD n7 1D in n-IrM) ' D n l n l m ,1 D D)* [6] 144</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDES' THEORY, ETC. The return of the eliminated predicate does not enrich my knowledge of the subject. The exclusion of B from the field of the predicabilia of A made this field infinite minus one, the restoration of B brings back that one predicate to the infinite field. In other words, the negative infinite proposition adds that one predicate only as possible; or in our case the attribute not- ignorant or not non-wise would only mean that wisdom may be predicated of God; it would exclude ignorance, but would include wisdom not as a definite attribute-only as a possible one. Maimonides, therefore, makes one more decisive step. Of the negation of privation--nyn,l n1, --its first part is now attacked, the negation, the nr'vw. Of this negation Maimonides empha- sizes that it must not be understood "except in the way which you know, namely, to negate, as is sometimes done, an attribute in reference to a thing which attribute can never be applied to that thing.

Let us see. If Maimonides had in mind a double negation or even the negation of a privation the most suitable example would have been "the man is not blind" which means "the man sees" and which would outwardly correspond perfectly to the statement "God is not ignorant" meaning "God is wise." The example "The wall does not see" is not convertible into a sentence "the wall is blind," because both, sight as well as blindness, are not predicable of the wall, just as "salted" or "insipid" in refer- ence to voice.-We find in Maimonides' Milot Hahigayon 21 More p. 86b; Guide p. my b: pSin Ni1 : ?

How, then, does the same content become possible in the negative statement "the wall does not see?" It is possible not as negation but as privation. Its form is not "A is not B" but "A is non-B," i. e., the wall is a non-seeing thing, seeing and its opposite can not be attributed to it. It is a typical privative proposition. If then the negation appears to be a privation, we have before us a privation of a privation. Let us now see what this means, in form and in content. In form we have again an infinite proposition, the copula is positive but the predicate is a double privation. The form is not, as in the negation of the privation, "A is not non-B" but it is "A is non-non-B," or if we choose to substitute C for non-B, we say "A is non-C." It is then again a positive infinite proposition with the predicate non-non-B or non-C. What does this proposition signify? For a clearer understanding let us review and start with the simple infinite proposition, and through the negative infinite proposition come to our case. 1) The simple infinite proposition, A is non-B, signifies that from the field of possible predicates of A-B is eliminated. We may attribute to A all the infinite predicates except B. 2) The negative infinite proposition, A is not non-B, signifies the denial of the elimination of B from the field of the A-predi- cates; B returns to the infinite number of possible predicates, it may be attributed to A. 3) The privative infinite proposition, or the double privation, A is non-non-B (or A is non-C, if C stands for non-B), signifies the elimination of C or non-B from the field of possible predi- cates, and since non-B meant the elimination of B, non-non-B means the elimination of this elimination, that is to say, every- thing may be predicated of A except non-B or the elimination of B; or in other words, whatever we may eliminate from the field of possible predicates of A-B must remain. In short: B must be a possible predicate of A. 146 [8]</page><page sequence="9">MAIMONIDES' THEORY, ETC. If this is the meaning of the double privation "God is non- ignorant" or "God is non-non-wise" then the proposition amounts to the statement: Whatever we may exclude from being predi- cated about God, Wisdom must remain. and so Might, Will, etc. Such an attribute, consisting of a double privation, is less and more than the positive-or, which is the same, double negative22 -attribute. It is less because it does not attach the predicate directly and immediately to the subject, but the predicate still remains at a certain distance from the subject, in the field of the possible predicates. But it is more than they, because it states necessity instead of mere factual connection; it is not assertoric, it is apodictic. And in our case that distance of the necessary predicate from its subject is also a great advantage; all the dangers of the positive attribute of God-plurality, accidentality, etc.-are removed and still the God concept does not become empty but fully endowed with indispensable, unde- niable attributes. The connection between subject and predicate under the categories of relation almost dissolves into nothing, when the centre of gravity is shifted to modality. The statement is purely apodictic; we don't say assertorically "God is wise" but we say apodictically "God must be wise" or even more exactly: "Of God one must be able to say that he is wise," because the necessity refers to a possible predicate. The entire statement is moved from the assertive into the field of the postulative, of the necessary claim. Compared again with ch. 57, where the element of privation was first introduced, we see the great difference in the results. In 57 the privation referred to a class of predicates, or to many classes or in fact to all classes; the result was a negative one; it was a sort of agnostic purity of the God concept. Here we have the privation referred not to a predicate or classes of it but to a possibility, to the possibility of the elimination of certain predicates-hence the result is highly positive. The privation 22 The double negative proposition may in its form sometimes resemble the simple infinite proposition, but already Ghazali emphasized, that it is fully affirmative in its character. "Petrus est insipiens"="Petrus est stultus." Cf. Prantl, op. cit., II p. 373. [9] 147</page><page sequence="10">148 DIESENDRUCK [10] motif of 57 was not dropped but applied in a more productive way. And we see in ch. 59 that the motif of 57 appears even stronger. After we have removed the possibility of eliminating wisdom from God and so have established the apodictical neces- sity of retaining it as possible predicate-we are again warned not to take this necessity as a sort of "perfection" (nilrV) or "property" (lpp) with God, because these anthropomorphic qualities must remain removed.23 The predicate, in our case, shall never come too close to the subject. How great the distance is between the plane of the double privation and that of the commonplace negative attributes or even of the privation in ch. 57 may be seen from the fact, that Maimonides repeatedly and most emphatically demands that those privations must be reached by demonstration. Ch. 60:24 -7 l T132: 'I1nw 6' ,m n 1 L 3n fwl,; niw 1I O nnw t -n 7D li. "And you must be very careful to increase your denials-what- ever you deny, (i. e., the privations of 58)-by proof not by mere words." Similarly in ch. 59. Each added privative attribute must be demonstrated; and according to the amount of such demonstrated privations a man ranks, and this determines his nearness to God; because this is the criterion.25 How could such a demand of progressive demonstration of the individual attri- butes be thinkable in the mere negation or even in ch. 57? There the main purpose was the removal of anthropomorphic elements, and the more general and inclusive the established homonymity is, the better. Only in the double-privation the individual attribute comes to its right and significance. It must be fought for and conquered. The idea in such double privative attributes is not a knowledge one has once and for all and is then 23 More p. 88 a, Guide I p. ay a. 24 More p. 90a; Guide p. ny b: ' '3oD -iTwrn 1K r, n S[ I 3 i n n X opmD =ipis 3IDn 1 b 1 n m S 1 . 25 More p. 87b: nI,w n D i Dn 1 n~inn niv no i: : 13 nIlnn n: 1 min Wf -inl, r,nn iunn -rns n3T; Guide p. my b: '1 1 nl 3 n7 m 7 1 15 fi3n rp9P 37N n3 ;miy D ,s :D; and previously: 3npn nSYn' 1unn n,', ;Dln'm n' i: 1I n 7 17D 73 n sn l nm w -in331D nS 7 73 t 4 'hw 'DD ' 1H 7311K n ', 'nl l ;lria;n m (n,mD nNm 1 i1 n n m n :' ' ,i's 1D n,'K :=ipm n3l) in5,s; and repeatedly nsl3 nmn,--1n-]m3n'-for each degree of the progressive cognition.</page><page sequence="11">MAIMONIDES' THEORY, ETC. at rest-but it is a task, demanding the continuance of the progressing strife for new cognition. This theory of Maimonides, then, represents a new and far- reaching solution of the fundamental attribute problem, namely how to avoid direct predication with all its consequences and still safeguard a meaningful productive God concept, capable of growth and development. But'it represents also an important contribution to Logic in general. It saves the infinite proposi- tion as a highly productive logical operation. Since its reintro- duction by Kant in his table of Categories the infinite proposition has been subject to many critical attacks and some of the leading logicians abandoned it altogether as meaningless.26 Here, in its doubled form of the rny;n ni,"w, it proves to be able to give a logical formula for apodictic necessity, which no other form of negation can do. It is, so to speak, the logical form for the predominant modality, for the apodictically demanded, postu- lated.-Without explaining it further Kant remarks concerning the infinite proposition that it may be of use in a priori proposi- tions, the same usefulness for the a priori he also indicates briefly in reference to modality.27 Here we have a case where both, infinite proposition and modality, meet and in a realm of a priori reasoning.-That Maimonides starts this discussion with a renewed emphasis of God as nl1wnn nin, necessarily existent, as against the nlN;,xl n~v9, possibly existent,28-if we keep in mind the implications of these two concepts-may well be mentioned in this connection. As to Maimonides himself we may remark that by giving the negation-rn'wv-such a privative character we have in his terminology a new, a fifth type of privation, namely the logical privation. The other four-namely the Aristotelian specific privation (nl'Tn;r ny'nl), the absolute privation (1K l,riD Ty1Tnn nmn;I), the mathematico-logical privation (y33;n), and the priva- tion of properties (',mp;, n^yn)--I have discussed at length in 26 E. g.

And it was Hermann Cohen33 who first intro- duced here the term: "infinite proposition" and also recognized the highly positive nature of Maimonides' attributes. My inter- pretation, however, differs essentially from his. In the first place, he stops at the negation of privation without noticing the privative character of the negation; secondly he introduces the infinite proposition in his (Cohen's) own interpretation, namely as the main method of cognition in connection with the Ursprung, the origin of epistemological production; of this Ursprung, noth- ing can be found in or even read into Maimonides. Thirdly he substitutes here for his own epistemological "Ursprung" a sort of ontological Ursprung, so that the entire theory of attributes becomes centered in the idea of creation, which is again unten- able.-Cohen is not unaware of all this when he states34 that he "nachgeht einem Grundgedanken seiner eigenen systematischen Logik" and continues: "Damit ist ausgesprochen, dass die Unbe- fangenheit der Er6rterung, die Objektivitat der historischen Beleuchtung auf eine harte Probe gestellt wird." 29 Cf. my study in Tarbiz quoted above n. 16, also my study niyyin rvi 'anoin minn in Abhandlungen zur Erinnerung an H.

This only prepared the logical ground for the other group of attributes, the attributes of action. On the other hand when he demands demonstrations for the progressive privations, they, too, must be drawn from some realm of cogni- tion-and so our discussion here must be supplemented by a clarification of the terms God and World, Attributes of Action, Attributes and Teleology, Homonymity and many others. Only in a synoptic way may we be able to come closer to a full under- standing of his teachings.</page></plain_text>
