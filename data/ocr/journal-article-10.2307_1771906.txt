<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OBJECT-POEM In Defence of Referentiality SHIMON SANDBANK Comparative Literature, Hebrew University I The history of poetry after Romanticism may be - and has been - seen as a direct development out of it. The three conceptions which Rene Wellek has claimed make it possible to speak of Romanticism as one European movement - imagination, nature and symbol (1963:128-198) - can be shown to be equally central to the poetry that succeeded it. They may be said, moreover, to have become even more extreme in their claim for totality. The omnipotence of the imagination, moulding the facts of the world according to its own "esemplastic" vision, is nowhere as total as in French Surrealism; the vitalistic, anthropomorphic idea of nature is nowhere as violent as in German Expressionism; and the use of symbol and myth for poetic style is at least as central to Rilke or Yeats as it is to Shelley. But if post-Romantic developments can be shown to continue and reinforce the Romantic mode, they can also be said to move in the opposite direction. It is this opposite direction, moreover, that may be regarded - as for instance by T.S. Eliot in an aside on the imagistsI - as more central to Modernism. For if the subordination of world to mind, eye to I, facts to symbols, is the common ground of Wellek's three criteria, this ground is often abandoned in the poetry of the last hundred and fifty years. An awareness of the dangers of over-subjectivity, a felt need to return from the flights of the imagination to a cleaner, closer look at extra-human facts, seems important - though in very different ways - to Hopkins or Hulme in England, to Leconte de Lisle or Francis Ponge in France, to Liliencron or Rilke in Germany, to William Carlos Williams or Wallace Stevens in the U.S. Its motivation varies from case to case: it can be theological, aesthetic or social. And the form it takes also 1. "The point de repere usually and conveniently taken as the starting-point of modern poetry, is the group denominated 'imagists' in London about 1910" (T.S. Eliot 1966:58). Poetics Today, Vol. 6:3 (1985) 461-473</page><page sequence="2">462 SHIMON SANDBANK varies: there seems to be very little in common between Rilke's virtuoso fluency and Williams's "volts, jerks, sulks, balks, outblurts and jumpovers" (Pound, quoted by Tomlinson 1976:11), or between Hopkins's highly dense textures and Stevens's limpid abstractions. A common drive to objectivity, however, gives sufficient grounds for treating them together as members of a heterogeneous tradition - the tradition of what can be called object-poetry: poetry about physical phenomena which, rather than subordinating them to the perceiving mind, tends to give them priority over it. This is largely an unconscious tradition. No manifest historical links cement it, except in isolated cases such as Hopkins's admiration for Ruskin (not an object-poet, of course, but critical of excessive non-objectivity), or Pound's for Gautier. The poets concerned do not look up to any single model, nor do any of them present "objectivity" pure and simple, which could serve as a yardstick for the others. But T.E. Hulme's ideal of "accurate, precise, and definite description" (1954:132), though certainly problematic, can serve as the normative idea which they pursued, the radical logical conclusion of their conscious or unconscious efforts. An examination of the way they approximated it and eventually stopped short of it, is one interesting approach to their work and to some aspects of post- Romantic poetry as such. Object-poetry gives rise to very many questions. Some are psy- chological: the way the phenomenal world of our experience relates to the physical world of objects; the ways both writer and reader perceive objects, recollect their perceptions in mental images, transform them into - or retrieve them from - words. A central problem in this connection is that of the boundaries between I and eye, between our norms, experience, knowledge, attitudes, goals, expectations, projections, interests and wishes, on the one hand, and the presumably "innocent" perception needed for a "precise description" of an object, on the other. Another set of problems would be linguistic: the limitations imposed on "definite descrip- tion" by the indefiniteness of language, its generic lexis which can never do justice to particulars, or the abstract relational systems which its grammar imposes on physical reality. In this paper, however, I would like to deal with the object-poem neither in its psychological nor in its linguistic aspects, but as poetry. From the point of view of poetics, the central problem seems to me to be the very possibility of object-poetry. For "accurate" and "precise," which are Hulme's adjectives, imply a judgement of poetry in terms of its approximation to the outside world. The accuracy or inaccuracy of description cannot be judged except in relation to what is external to the poem. But is it not precisely this relation which modern poetics has fought so insistently to do away with? Do such criteria not violate fictionality, the self-referentiality which</page><page sequence="3">THE OBJECT POEM 463 has been embraced as the final victory over extrinsic - that is, irrelevant - readings of poetry? These are considerable questions, which I will not presume to solve. Instead, taking the example of what I call object-poetry, I shall try to show some ways in which it may be said to call into question the exclusion of referentiality from poetry. II It has been a clichi of literary theory for many years that the poetic use of language is different from its cognitive or referential use. Roman Jakobson, though he allows for other functions to be present in poetry, still regards the "poetic function" as its "determining function." And the "poetic function," centering on the "message," must lead away from the "context" or referent: by "promoting the palpability of signs" it must deepen "the fundamental dichotomy of signs and objects" (1960:356). Much the same seems to be meant by Northrop Frye's distinction between the "centripetal" direction of literary texts and the "centrifugal" direction of "descriptive or assertive writing," where one moves outwards, from words to things (1973:73). Post-structuralism - Barthes or Derrida - has been particularly insistent on the "self-referentiality" of literature. Barthes claims that literary language, unlike language involved in praxis, is "intransitive": that no context surrounds and restricts its semantic possibilities. In this respect, what Terence Hawkes calls "New 'New Criticism' " goes beyond the New Critics' insistence on the "autonomy" of the poetic text: Barthes and others are prepared to embrace the total implications of the work of art's self-referentiality without any limits imposed by a sense of an ultimate "objective" or concrete reality beyond itself to which the work must be seen to refer. "New" New Criticism would thus claim to respond to literature's essential nature in which signifiers are prised utterly free of signifieds (1977:156). If we take this dichotomy between "referential" and "poetic," "centrifugal" and "centripetal," "transitive" and "intransitive" to be absolute, the object-poem seems to become an impossibility. For aiming at an external thing, it will accurately answer Frye's definition, not of literary, but of "assertive" writing, where we keep going outside our reading, from the individual words to the things they mean [. . .] the final direction is outward. Here the verbal structure is intended to represent things external to it, and it is valued in terms of the accuracy with which it does represent them. Correspondence between phenomenon and verbal sign is truth; lack of it is falsehood (1973:73-74). One wonders, however, whether the dichotomy between the two is as exclusive as all that. Can literary writing escape all centrifugal reading? One cannot but agree with Roger Fowler's protest against</page><page sequence="4">464 SHIMON SANDBANK "the extreme of the New Critical aesthetic": Poems are unequivocally in a language which exists independently outside the poems, and this fact guarantees "reference out," connection with the outside world (1971:90). Nor does Frye himself exclude "the standards of outward meaning" from literature. He only regards them as "secondary" to the "inward meaning." The "sign-values of symbols," he says, do not disappear in poetry, but "are subordinated to their importance as a structure of interconnected motifs" (1973:74). Jacobson, on his part, warns us that "any attempt [...] to confine poetry to poetic function would be a delusive oversimplification" (1960:356). Moreover, much of what has been going on in recent literary theory is obviously a reaction away from the "objective fallacy," from the concept of the poem as an object divorced from poet, reader and world (see Miner 1976:11-31, Fish 1970-1971:123- 162). Christine Brooke-Rose, in a recent survey, has shown how functions of language other than the poetic - particularly the conative function, centering on the reader - have gradually gained in critical interest (1980:153-182). Should the referential function, too, enjoy a critical revival? Neither Jakobson nor Frye oust reference from poetry. "The supremacy of poetic function over referential function," says the former, "does not obliterate the reference." Instead, it makes reference ambiguous: The double-sensed message finds correspondence in a split addresser, in a split addressee, and besides, in a split reference (1960:371). The ambiguity of the reference is, if I understand it, a simul- taneous reference both "out" and "in," both to the extra-linguistic world and to the linguistic "world" created by the text. But surely "reference out" is obliterated in the process. Jakobson's "supremacy of poetic function" must, according to its own logic, entail the obliteration of real reference, its replacement by what Paul Ricoeur describes as "a more fundamental mode of reference": The suspension of reference in the sense defined by the norms of descriptive discourse is the negative condition of the appearance of a more fundamental mode of reference, whose explication is the task of interpretation. [...] Suspension of real reference is the condition of access to the virtual mode of reference. [...] The epoche of natural reality is the condition that allows poetry to develop a world on the basis of the mood that the poet articulates. It will be the task of interpretation to elaborate the design of a world liberated, by suspension, from descriptive reference. The creation of a con- crete object - the poem itself - cuts language off from the didactic function of the sign, but at the same time opens up access to reality in the mode of fiction and feeling (1977:229). Though he uses the word "reference," Ricoeur does not really readmit the referential function. His "more fundamental mode of</page><page sequence="5">THE OBJECT POEM 465 reference" is conditioned, on the contrary, by the "suspension of real reference." "Reality in the mode of fiction and feeling" is no different from "poetic," or "imaginative," reality. Thus, th'e feeling that the referential function should be left out of poetry and that its suspension, indeed, is what distinguishes literary from other texts, is universal. But the object-poem, which is my subject, is precisely that type of poem which calls this distinction into question. For it is a poem committed to the real world. Jakobson's description of prose as a "transitional linguistic area," where "the transition is between strictly poetic and strictly refer- ential language" (1960:374), seems perfectly applicable to the object-poem too. Being a "transitional linguistic area," object poetry, like prose in Jakobson's terms, "presents more entangled problems for poetics" (1960:374). If a continuum of verbal art could be imagined, reaching from the "almost strictly poetic" to the "almost strictly referential" (I say "almost," for both "strictly poetic" and "strictly referential" would be impossible: the one implying disregard for the fact that language, in Fowler's words, "exists independently outside the poem;" the other leaving out the very essence of literariness) then the object-poem would gravitate towards the "almost strictly referential." If the so-called autonomous poem - the poem that aims at "being" rather than "meaning" - approximates to the "almost strictly poetic," the object-poem would lean towards the opposite pole. It would have a minimum of -the elements that are conducive to a poem's autonomy: inner coherence, firm structure, formal elaborateness, semantic unity, the various forms of what Jakobson calls "similarity" or "equivalence," including metaphor. It would be marked, on the contrary, by a centrifugal correspondence with the extra-linguistic world, by semantic multiplicity, a loose pattern- ing ("disarray as proof of authenticity," says John Ashbery, though he calls it "false" [1975:69]), subordination of form to content, and a predominance of "contiguity," that is, metonymic relation- ships (see Jakobson 1956:76-82). It would, in other words, share with non-fictional prose the maximum qualities that poetry can share with it without forfeiting its status as poetry. This minimal exploitation of verse-form makes object-poetry a particularly suitable case for the approach which focuses on reader rather than message. Jonathan Culler, in his book Structuralist Poetics, is one of its most articulate spokesmen. Criticizing Jakobson's linguistic analyses of poems, he claims that one should start rather with the effects of a poem: The fact that a text is a poem is not the necessary result of its linguistic properties, and attempts to base a theory of poetry on an account of the special properties of the language of poems seems doomed to failure. [...] The essence of poetry lies not in verbal artifice itself, though that serves as</page><page sequence="6">466 SHIMON SANDBANK catalyst, but more simply and profoundly in the type of reading (attitude de lecture) which the poem imposes on its readers. [....] Neither the formal patterns nor linguistic deviation of verse suffices in itself to produce the true structure or state of poetry. The third and crucial factor, which can operate effectively even in the absence of the others, is that of conventional expecta- tion, or the type of attention which poetry receives by virtue of its status within the institution of literature. To analyse poetry from the point of view of poetics is to specify what is involved in these conventional expectations which make poetic language subject to a different teleology or finality from that of ordinary speech and how these expectations or conventions con- tribute to the effects of formal devices and of the external contexts that poetry assimilates (1977:162, 164). Applied to the object-poem, Culler's approach would mean that it is the reader's expectations, regardless of the presence or non- presence of verbal artifice, that make it a poem. In fact, Culler explicitly refers to a type of poem which falls within our category - the imagist poem. It is the reader's expectation of "significance" that explains to Culler why imagist poetry is poetry: If an object [... . is the focus of a poem, that implies, by convention, that it is especially important: the "objective correlative" of an intense emotion or the locus of a moment of revelation. This applies particularly to imagist poems (p. 175). The claim that a poem's "poemness" resides in the interaction between poem and reader rather than in any specifically poetic use of language, raises many questions. Some of Culler's phrasings betray the basic difficulty of distinguishing the conventions we (and, of course, who are "we"?) impose on the text from what the text imposes on us. In addition, the (never irrelevant) question of evalua- tion comes up. Take two imagist ladies - H.D. and Amy Lowell: C.K. Stead, in The New Poetic, claims that the former is a better poet than the latter, because in the hands of Amy Lowell Imagism became "merely a technique for giving sequences of ineffectual prose the appearance of a kind of poetry" (1966:101). But once the "true state of poetry" is believed to be produced by our "type of atten- tion," there can be little difference between poetry and "the appearance of a kind of poetry." Leaving these questions aside, Culler's approach, though modified, can provide a defense for the type of poem I described as leaning towards the "almost strictly referential." I say "modified" because, though the reduction of "poemness" to the "type of attention" we give a poem is precisely what would make it possible to accept the "almost referential" poem as a poem, the specific conventions which Culler includes in this "type of attention" would not make it possible. These conventions, according to Culler, include fictionality or the exclusion of "reference out" (discussed under "Distinction and deixis," pp. 164 ff.) and "significance" ("Theme and epiphany" pp. 175 ff.). This is why the imagist poem he quotes to illustrate</page><page sequence="7">THE OBJECT POEM 467 the above point, W.C. Williams's "This Is Just To Say," is said to be deprived of its "circumstantial function" and provided by the reader with "a new function to justify" it. It is arguable, however, that the poem shows, on the contrary, that the "convention of significance" must not be regarded as universal,2 and that a "non-significant" reference to reality is the very point of such a poem. Thus, this type of "almost referential" poem, accepted as a poem by virtue of the type of attention we give it, should modify, on its part, our conventional expectations and add the convention of non- significant "thereness" to the list. An extremely bare object-poem such as Williams's "Between Walls," whose centripetal elements are minimal and "reference out" maximal, may still retain the "true state of poetry," in spite of an almost total lack of the poetic function. III I have mentioned, however, not only Williams, but also Hopkins and Rilke as members of the object-poetry tradition, and Hopkins and Rilke are poets whose exploitation of verse-form is anything but minimal. How is their radical focusing on language and form to be reconciled with the referential impulse which, I have been claiming, is basic to object-poetry? I have mentioned in passing that the generic nature of words can hardly do justice to the particular object. Words, as we know, denote, not single items, but classes of things. What is peculiar to the individual is precisely what the sense of the word leaves out, and this happens to be exactly what the object-poet is interested in: the "non-distinctive" features of a situation - the size, shape, color of, say a particular apple, not the "distinctive" or semantic features, common to all situations that call forth the utterance of the word "apple." These linguistic aspects of the problem are beyond the scope of this paper. For the sake of my present argument, however, I would like to mention some of the means which the object-poet can employ in order to overcome, however partly, the generic quality of language. One is, simply, specification, or more accurately, what can be called inessential specification. For to specify the quality of a. perceived object, the poet must go beyond its essential qualities, those that must belong to an object for it to be called, say, "apple," and bring to the fore those attributes which are inessential, belong- ing, not to the "sense," but to the accidents of the individual being of apple x or y. 2. This is a point Terence Hawkes makes in response to Culler in Hawkes's Structuralism and Semiotics (1977:140). But Hawkes sees it as a "poem about its own status," which is not the point I am making.</page><page sequence="8">468 SHIMON SANDBANK Another means of bringing words closer to things is verbal mimesis. By exploiting those signs in the language which are less arbitrarily and more naturally related to things, that is, signs which are "iconic" or "mimetic" of whatever they signify, the object-poet can concretize and particularize language. Verbal mimesis can be either graphic ("pattern poetry," for instance), phonetic (onoma- topoeia, etc.), gestural (motion and shape imitated by the articula- tory muscles), or diagrammatic (imitating, not single qualities, but structure, the relations of parts) (see Jakobson 1965:21-37; Wimsatt 1975:229-248). Such means of overcoming the generalizing quality of language can be employed in many different ways. Poetically, they can be either marked or unmarked. Take Williams's famous "Red Wheelbarrow." Its specification as red and glazed with rain water is poetically unmarked, involving no foregrounding of the utterance itself, except perhaps in the slightly figurative "glazed." Lineation, for Williams, does all the formal work, while otherwise the utterance sticks to a deliberately transparent referentiality. The same referential impulse, however, may lead to very different results. When Hart Crane speaks of the "poinsettia meadows of (the sea's) tides" - assuming for our purpose that he is merely interested in a precise verbal equivalent of a perception - his very use of the unusual "poinsettia" to specify the sort of red he has in mind must (in addition to the metaphor, of course) thicken the verbal texture of the line. Or take a line from Hopkins: It will flame out, like shining from shook foil This seems a rather perverse example to take, because the physical phenomenon referred to is not at all presented for its own sake, but as a simile for "God's Grandeur." Thus, its verbal form may be explained partly in terms of its figurative function. There is a letter by Hopkins, however, which shows his selection of words to be dictated by accurate observation and makes it a good illustration for the point I am trying to make. "I do not mean by foil set-off at all," Hopkins writes to Robert Bridges, I mean foil in its sense of leaf or tinsel, and no other word whatever will give the effect I want. Shaken gold foil gives off broad glares like sheet lightning and also, and this is true of nothing else, owing to its zigzag dints and creasings and network of small many cornered facets, a sort of fork lightning too (1955:169). "Foil" is chosen because "no other word whatever will give the effect I want," by which Hopkins does not mean sound-effect, but correspondence with an external thing. "Foil" is exactly the right word because it refers to that particular thing which gives off both types of lightning, "and this is true of nothing else." But the very</page><page sequence="9">THE OBJECT POEM 469 choice of a word the specific sense of which must be explained in a letter, a word rare, in this particular sense, in the poetry of the time,3 already shifts attention from "context" to "message." The same holds for the unusual substantive use of "shining" and passive form "shook." These forms, too, are employed in order to get as close as possible to the phenomenon described in the letter to Bridges: "shining" - because as participial noun it refers to the dynamic act, the "flaming out," rather than to its outcome; "shook" - perhaps because it is onomatopoeic, imitating the sound of shaking. In the process, however, the palpability of the signs them- selves has been promoted, language has partly replaced extra- linguistic reality. The signifier, not only the signified, is now fore- grounded and becomes as much an object as the thing referred to. The same may be said of many formal peculiarities of Hopkins's style: his neologisms, twisted syntax, even alliterations. They all at least partly serve precision of reference either through semantic specification or through verbal mimesis. Paradoxically, in order to be overcome, language is foregrounded. It is this paradox which may reconcile the highly poetic use of language in certain object-poets, Hopkins or Rilke, for instance, with their referential impulse. In the process of referring as precisely as possible to a perceived object, a poet such as Hopkins passes over from a focus on reference to a focus on language, from the "referential function" to the "poetic function." This seems to have some further implications for the question of the referential versus the poetic. In the case of the minimalist object-poem, we saw that its referential impulse reduced the poetic function to a minimum; here, on the contrary, the referential impulse produces a poetic use of language. The poetic function, it turns out, must not be unambi- guously opposed to the referential function. At times it must be rather understood as resulting from it: for if the poetic focus on the form of the message usually involves a neglect of context, it may also result, on the contrary, from a wish for maximum fidelity to context. The examples I have quoted to illustrate this point - "poinsettia," "foil," "shining," "shook" - are poetically marked, but in a loose sense. The word, is uncommon, either lexically or morphologically, and hence foregrounded.4 One could go one step further, however, and suggest that even the stricter "empirical linguistic criterion of the poetic function," as proposed by Jakobson, may be shown at times to be the product of a referential impulse. 3. Wordsworth uses it several times, and Keats once, in the sense of "set-off." Tennyson does not use it at all. 4. I have in mind Jan Mukarfovsk 's definition of poetic language as "maximum fore- grounding of the utterance," in his "Standard Language and Poetic Language" (Mukariovsk' 1964:19).</page><page sequence="10">470 SHIMON SANDBANK What I am referring to is his well-known definition of the poetic function as the projection of "the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination" (1960:358). It is sound equivalence that he primarily has in mind, but sound- equivalence necessarily involves semantic equivalence as well: Equivalence in sound, projected into the sequence as its constitutive prin- ciple, inevitably involves semantic equivalence. [...] In poetry not only the phonological sequence but in the same way any sequence of semantic units strives to build an equation. [. . .] Words similar in sound are drawn to- gether in meaning (1970:368, 370, 371). That is why poetic equivalence involves not only "schemes" but also "tropes," and why it is related to the "metaphoric pole" while realistic prose is largely "metonymic," that is, in Jakobson's borrowed sense, organized according to relations of contiguity (1956:76-82). Object-poetry, like realistic prose, must be predominantly metonymic: following the relations among things, its sequence is determined by the objective contiguity of things to one another, not by the equivalences imposed by the subjective mind. So it does in Williams's "Wheelbarrow." But in order to be seen anew, perceived in their authentic reality, things must be "made strange" by litera- ture, as the Russian Formalists have shown. To be seen afresh, says Shklovsky, an object must be placed "in a new semantic row, in a row of concepts which belong to another category;" it "has to be removed from the series of real-life facts," to be torn "from the row of habitual associations in which you find it" (Shklovsky, quoted in trans. in Jameson 1972:60, 70, note 25; orig. in Shklovsky 1929: 245,279). Should this not mean that maximum fidelity to an authentic, independent perception of an object may call for its liberation from contiguity, for the replacement of the metonymic by the meta- phoric? That equivalence may not only separate word from world and deepen the "fundamental dichotomy" between them, but also, on the contrary, bring the word closer to a world seen afresh? T.E. Hulme, for one, seems to have thought so when he did not oppose the use of metaphor to his "great aim" of "precise and definite description," and claimed, on the contrary, that metaphor was the chief means of attaining this goal: Poetry [...] is not a counter language, but a visual concrete one. [...] It always endeavours to arrest you, and to make you continuously see a physical thing, to prevent you gliding through an abstract process. It chooses fresh epithets and fresh metaphors [. . .] because the old cease to convey a physical thing and become abstract counters. A poet says a ship 'coursed the sea' to get a physical image, instead of the counter word 'sailed.' Visual meanings can only be transferred by the new bowl of metaphor; prose is an old pot that lets them leak out (1954:134-135, my italics).</page><page sequence="11">THE OBJECT POEM 471 This would explain why H.D., hailed as "the most truly imagistic" of the imagists by Edward Storer in 1915 (Harmer 1975:62), should have based her most-quoted poem, "Oread," on a central metaphor; or why Ezra Pound should have regarded the "super-position" of two images as the means of recording an instant of intense perception; or why W.C. Williams should have called poems such as "Daisy" and "Great Mullen" "still-lifes," although they are radically meta- phorical (Williams 1967:47). The two contradictory theories of the image - one cognitive and the other perceptual - which have often been seen as the bane of Imagist theory, can thus be viewed, rather, as complementary. Metaphor can serve - to quote two seemingly incongruous precepts of Pound's - both the presentation of "an intellectual and emotional complex" and the "direct treatment of the 'thing'." Semantic equivalence, in other words, works not only centri- petally. It is not always a purely linguistic interplay of sense which obliterates reference to the world and encourages self-referentiality. It can also be seen as an attempt to refer as clearly as possible, through metaphor and association, to a true vision of the world.s It is further arguable that sound-equivalence too is not necessarily a mere reinforcement of the density of the texture of poetic lan- guage; that it may fulfill, not only the poetic function, but the referential function as well. In an article entitled "The Meaning of Sound Patterns in Poetry," Benjamin Hrushovski (1980) has distinguished four kinds of rela- tions between sounds and meanings in poetry: (1) onomatopoeia; (2) expressive sound patterns; (3) focusing sound patterns; and (4) neutral sound patterning, where sound has "no direct relation to the meanings of the immediate words, or to the relations between such meanings" (p. 53). It is only in this fourth, neutral type of sound-meaning relation (admittedly, "the most widespread in poetry") that Jakobson's poetic function - in the sense of "focus on the message for its own sake" (1960:356) - is fulfilled in its pure form. All other types involve some connection between sound and meaning, thus tran- scending the mere form of the message and pointing to a meaning. And since they are seldom limited to single words, but form sound- patterns spread over several words - that is, repeated sounds or sound-equivalences - they are all forms of sound-equivalence which serve not merely the poetic function, but the referential and 5. Judith Dundas (1973:197-203) also claims that metaphors can enhance visual experi- ence, but only as long as they show "a fairly obvious congruity between the things compared," whereas witty or incongruous metaphors "force the reader into an examination of the base of the comparisons and hence away from the visual experience" (p. 201). My point is that it is not necessarily so.</page><page sequence="12">472 SHIMON SANDBANK expressive functions as well. In the following line, discussed by Hrushovski, from Poe's "The Raven": And thesilken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain it is the referential function that is reinforced by the repeated S and RT. The reference to the sound of rustling is reinforced by an entire line bristling with sound-equivalents of this word. Thus, the poetic use of language - both semantic and phonetic equivalence - can at times be shown to derive from a referential impulse. The radical formalisms of a Rilke Ding-poem are all mobilized to express the thing. This is why he can speak of his highly elaborate poem "The Ball" as a poem in which he succeeded in letting the ball speak "exactly as it is, without any addition of my own [...] nothing except the almost inexpressible phenomenon of a pure movement" (reported by Elisabeth von Schmidt-Pauli, quoted in trans. in Peters 1963:102). In its own way, his poem is no less object-oriented than the minimalist "Wheelbarrow." That is why both Rilke and Williams can be regarded as belonging to the same anti-Romantic tradition of object-poetry. But their poetry refers to the objects of the world in two diametrically opposed ways: the one by making the form of the poem yield its richest mimetic fruit; the other by reducing it to the utmost neutrality.
