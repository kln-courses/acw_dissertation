Philosophically, the belief allies him with negative theologian Soren Kierkegaard for whom "truth is inwardness" which "cannot be direcdy communicated, for its direct expression is precisely externality."2 But insofar as Coleridge locates a kind of personal loss or error in assigning inherent truth to the externalized (spoken) word, he also anticipates de constructive language theories that view linguistic constructs as mediums of self-mystification.3 Coleridgean language theory and post-structuralism mirror one another superficially in their acknowledgment of the construct I am grateful to Andrew M.

Essentially, though, the two differ radicaUy: "behind" lan guage, deconstruction finds absence wh?e Coleridge finds divine essence. More than twenty years after the composition of "The EoUan Harp" (1795), Coleridge is stiU concerned with the function of oraUy-expressed faith and with the relationship between a priori faith and a posteriori expe rience. He writes in the Lay Sermons that This primal act of faith is enunciated in the word, god: a faith not derived from experience, but its ground and source, and without which the fleeting chaos of facts would no more form experience, that [sic] the dust of the grave can of itself make a Uving man. The imperative and oracular form of the inspired Scripture is the form of reason itself in aU things purely rational and moral.4 Coleridge here conflates the pronunciation of a word, "god," with a written text, scripture, but escapes contradiction by characterizing the written text as "imperative and oracular"?as verbal, essential, and imme diate. Such a conflation is perfecdy acceptable from the perspective of Coleridge the theologian: in scripture?and only in scripture?the speech act and the written word can be commensurate. However, this verbal/ textual coUapse becomes problematic for Coleridge the poet: how can faith that "inly feels" be communicated through human, non-imperative, faUen language? If "Scripture is the form of reason itself in aU things purely rational and moral," should it (or can it) also be the form of reason in things artistic? As I show in the foUowing readings of "The EoUan Harp" and "Kubla Khan," Coleridge seems to have considered poetic form?as it is both written and read?to be (ideaUy) a derivative of scriptural form. Although my concern wiU be primarily with the rhetorical tensions between Cole ridge's poetic figurations of the finite self and the scriptural divine, I think it important to first point out how versions of this tension pervaded Coleridge's thought as a theologian and ph?osopher.5 In these capacities, as in his poetic one, Coleridge eagerly sought to render God materiaUy 4- The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (CW), gen. ed.

Coleridge was aware of his own tendency (or attempt) to apply abstract principles to the more concrete discourses of poetry and criticism: he writes in the first paragraph of the Biographia Literaria that the work is "a statement of my principles in politics, religion, and philosophy, and the application of the rules, deduced from philosophical principles, to poetry and criticism" (CW, vol. 7, Biographia Literaria [BL] I, ed. James Engell and Walter Jackson Bate [1983] 234). It is my intent to expose this tendency as it existed even in the early years of Coleridge's literary life.</page><page sequence="3">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 29 present: to fashion material or temporal entities such as word, self, and property into finite repetitions of the infinite "i AM." For example, Coleridge's 1795-96 pivot away from Godwinian and Priesdeyan forms of rationalism back toward orthodoxy (ultimately in the form of Trinitarianism) mirrors, I think, the rhetorical reclamation of Christian faith inscribed in "The Eolian Harp "'s final verse paragraph. The evidence surrounding this doctrinal pivot makes Coleridge look something like the apostate he was accused of being: he left Cambridge in December 1794 "a compleat Necessitarian,"6 and then asks, a little more than a year later, "How is it that Dr. Priestly is not an atheist? . . . Has not Dr. Priesdy forgotten that Incomprehensibility is as necessary an attribute of the First Cause, as Love, or Power, or Intelligence?" (CL 1 #112). However, this turnabout is in part explained by the events of the intervening year, 1795, which witnessed Coleridge's Pantisocratic hope and its demise?events which, in themselves, again mark Coleridge's attempt (in political or economic terms) to replicate the infinite in the interstices of the finite. The realization of the Pantisocracy would have been for Coleridge the material manifestation of Priestley's Necessitarianism: the leveling of the hierarchy of spirit and matter would have been embodied in a leveled social and economic community where the many would constitute the One, or, in Coleridge's words, where "we should remove the selfish Principle from ourselves, and prevent it in our children, by an Abolition of Property, as would amount to a moral Sameness ..." (CL 1 #93). Coleridge indicates growing disillusionment with such "outward" at tempts to locate the infinite when he writes in 1802 that Though I should gaze for ever On that green light that lingers in the west: I may not hope from outward forms to win The passion and the life, whose fountains are within. ("Dejection: An Ode" 42-46) Redirecting his gaze toward Trinitarianism and political conservatism is not so much a repudiation of his previous beliefs as an attempt to solve the problem posed by the "outward forms" of his "greener," and more mate rialist, religious and philosophical tasks. This attempt is perhaps figured in Coleridge's social and political withdrawal between the years 1795 and 1806, and in the metaphysical and theological concerns of his later years which produced such works as the Logic, The Statesman's Manual, and Aids 6.

But in spite of such "inward" retreats, Coleridge's desire to effect the convergence of the concrete and the abstract does not abate. This desire can be traced, for example, in Coleridge's mature exegetical theory, which (as we wiU see) codifies the kinds of rhetorical tensions played out in his early poetry and which is, perhaps, one of the only modes in which Coleridge can satisfy the desire. The paragraph foUowing the famed Statesman's Manual passage distinguishing symbol from aUegory7 explains how the finite and the infinite are consummated in scripture: In the Bible every agent appears and acts as a self-subsisting individual: each has a life of its own, and yet aU are one life. The elements of necessity and free wiU are reconciled in the higher power of an omnipresent Providence, that predestinates the whole in the moral freedom of the integral parts. Of this the Bible never suffers us to lose sight. The root is never detached from the ground. It is God every where. . . . (LS 31) The bibUcal agent, a "self-subsisting individual" with a "Ufe of its own," also has meaning of its own, often conveying "moral quaUties or concep tions of the mind that are not in themselves objects of the senses"8?just as purely poetic aUegory does. As individuaUy considered tropes, bibUcal images are aUegorical wholes. However, their coUective force is symboUc, intending "the translucence of the Eternal through and in the Temporal." ExegeticaUy, Coleridge is caUing for a recognition of the co-presence of aUegorical history and symboUc truth in the Word of God, which present [s] to us the stream of time continuous as Life and a symbol of Eternity, inasmuch as the Past and the Future are virtuaUy contained in the Present. According therefore to our relative position on its banks the Sacred History becomes prophetic, the Sacred Prophecies historical. ... In the Scriptures therefore both Facts and Persons must of necessity have a twofold significance, a past and a future, a tempo rary and a perpetual, a particular and a universal appUcation. They must be at once Portraits and Ideals. (LS 30) Coleridge is not merely waxing paradoxical in these and sim?ar passages. Rather, he is striving to rectify degenerate modes of exegesis and scriptural 7. "Now an Allegory is but a translation of abstract notions into a picture-language which is itself nothing but an abstraction from objects of the senses; the principal being more worthless even than its phantom proxy, both alike unsubstantial, and the former shapeless to boot. On the other hand a Symbol ... is characterized by a translucence of the Special in the Individual or of the General in the Especial or of the Universal in the General.

The referent of a type was, without exception, sacred. Enlightened historians and theologians, how ever, had defiled this sanctity by paralleling secular history to scripture on the assumption that history, like scripture, was organic and prophetic. As biblical historian Paul Korshin points out, From the assumed unity of Christian and pagan myths, it was a short step to the belief that secular history is predictive, and that the histories of ancient Greece and Rome, and of the great kings of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, might hold forth some special lesson to seven teenth- and eighteenth-century England. . . . Narrative history was expeded to inform politics. (108) Likewise, it was a short step to the application of sacred history to secular history; in his Astrcea Redux, for example, Dryden writes that Charles H had like Christ been "forc'd to suffer for Himself and us," that he was like "banish'd David," and made "at his own cost like Adam wise" (104). Although Coleridge would agree with the Deists that excessive and fanciful typologizing leads to dangerously obscure and priestly forms of religion, he denounced their reduction of scripture to a mere series of logically correspondent facts?regardless of whether the reduction occurred within an exegetical or a secular typology. This denunciation is perhaps best illustrated in the passage from The Statesman's Manual distinguishing symbol from allegory. There, Coleridge explains the organic process of reading scripture by offering definitions of rhetorical tropes. I have here retained the usually excised introductory sentences that help establish this context: A hunger-bitten and idea-less philosophy naturally produces a starve ling and comfortless religion. It is among the miseries of the present age that it recognizes no medium between Literal and Metaphorical. Faith is either to be buried in the dead letter, or its name and honours 9- In Typologies in England: 1650-1820 (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1982), Paul J. Korshin has argued that "abstracted typology is the principal modification or corruption of conven tional theological typology during the English Enlightenment" (8); this characterization admits two warring perspectives, one of which understands the secular application of biblical types as a "modification," the other as theological "corruption." Coleridge himself was committed, it seems, to both perspectives. As we wiU see, he uses modified abstracted typology in his poetry, but he does so in order to recommend the redemption of corrupted scriptural typology. Coleridge is both product and critic of Uterary and theological seculari zation.</page><page sequence="6">32 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO usurped by a counterfeit product of the mechanical understanding, which in the blindness of self-complacency confounds Symbols with AUegories. Now an AUegory is but a translation of abstract notions into a picture-language which is itself nothing but an abstraction from objects of the senses; the principal being more worthless even than its phantom proxy, both alike unsubstantial, and the former shapeless to boot. On the other hand a Symbol ... is characterized by a translu cence of the Special in the Individual or of the General in the Especial or of the Universal in the General. Above aU by the translucence of the Eternal through and in the Temporal. It always partakes of the reaUty which it renders inteUigible; and wh?e it enunciates the whole, abides itself as a Uving part in that Unity, of which it is the repre sentative. (LS 30) Reading only the commonly excerpted segment gives the false impression that Coleridge is dismissing aUegory as a rhetorical strategy.10 Indeed, his emphasis on the Uterary nature of exegetical activity is so pointed that, over time, Coleridge criticism has virtuaUy dist?led the passage's rhetorical information from its exegetical context. But read in context, the passage becomes less an injunction against aUegory as a trope than an attempt to revive awareness of the symboUc nature of the Word, the Logos?to exhume faith from the "dead letter" of purely mechanical, aUegorical readings of scripture. Paul de Man's reading and use of this passage in "The RJietoric of Temporality," for instance, depends heav?y on secularizing the passage. Viewing Coleridge through the continental, enUghtened rationaUsms of Rousseau and Sch?ler, de Man abstracts Coleridge from his "context" as a nineteenth-century theologian and treats him purely as a rhetorician. Early in the essay de Man cites the Statesman's Manual passage as an example of the romantic valorization of symbol over aUegory, then goes on to quote from an 1818 lecture where Coleridge defines aUegory as io. In his essay "Coleridge and Allegory" (Modem Language Quarterly 39 [1987]: 62-77) John Gatta argues that the passage's exegetical context is the crucial determining factor in Coleridge's construction of these definitions of symbol and allegory. However, even in his plea for contextualization, Gatta still assumes that Coleridge unequivocally valorizes symbol over allegory. As my reading of The Statesman's Manual passage suggests, Coleridge is far less concerned with the tropes per se than he is with their divine object. Coleridge himself warns against reading out of context when he writes in the Biographia that "The fairest part of the most beautiful body will appear deformed and monstrous, if dissevered from its place in the organic Whole. Nay, on delicate subjects, where a seemingly trifling difference of more or less may constitute a difference in kind, even a faithful display of the main and supporting ideas, if yet they are separated from the forms by which they are at once cloathed and modified, may perchance present a skeleton indeed: but a skeleton to alarm and deter" (BL 1: 234).</page><page sequence="7">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 33 the employment of one set of agents and images with actions and accompaniments correspondent, so as to convey, wh?e in disguise, either moral quaUties or conceptions of the mind that are not in themselves objects of the senses ... so that difference is everywhere presented to the eye or imagination wh?e likeness is suggested to the mind; and this connectedly so that the parts combine to form a consistent whole. (MC 7) De Man accurately identifies an inconsistency between the former and latter definitions of aUegory; the latter, he argues, assigns to aUegory the same function of figuratively reveaUng the "consistent whole" as the former assigns to symbol. But de Man's equation of the "consistent whole" with the "translucence" upon which the earUer definition of symbol turns (192-93) neglects the different kinds of texts the two passages treat: the "consistent whole" of the second passage is a Uterary text, a poetic image; the "translucence" of the first is the Christian God revealed to the careful reader of scripture. AnalyticaUy, the conclusions de Man and Coleridge draw about aUegory are consistent in that they both emphasize difference: Coleridgean aUegory is a "picture language which is itself nothing but an abstraction from objects of the senses"; for de Man aUegory "corresponds to the unve?ing of an authenticaUy temporal destiny" and emphasizes the impossibiUty of uniting object and subject, referent and sign, origin and product (205). For both de Man and Coleridge, the effect of this type of aUegorical "text," or poetic consciousness, is to force the subject into a recognition of the impossibiUty of absolute, authentic, gu?t-free synthesis with the object. However, for de Man this object is always natural, temporal; for Coleridge it is sometimes divine and transcendent. Likewise, romantic symbo?sm in de Man's estimation articulates an attempt to hide from the non-self what aUegory continuaUy reveals: it is a "tenacious self-mystification" (208), a "temptation that has to be over come" (205). As we wiU see, Coleridge would seem to agree that symboUc consummation in poetry is impossible. In deference to his ineffable God, though, Coleridge would go beyond the rhetorical impossibiUty of sym boUsm and assert the heretical dangers of attempting in secular writing the translucence that only scripture achieves: such attempts are impious at best, jusdy incurring the "m?d reproof" of Sara's "serious eye" ("The EoUan Harp" 49-50). But in a strictly poetic or rhetorical interpretation of The Statesman's Manual definitions (such as the one de Man advances), I think Coleridge would agree with de Man that gestures toward symbol usuaUy result in a heightened sense of disjunction between poetic subject and object?particularly in poems such as "Reflections on Having Left a Place</page><page sequence="8">34 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO of Retirement," "The Eolian Harp," and "The Nightingale," all of which conclude with the bittersweet relinquishing of a natural object. However, respecting the scriptural context of the rhetorical definitions proffered in The Statesman's Manual does elucidate the point of departure between Coleridge as early nineteenth-century theologian and de Man as late twentieth-century post-structuralist. De Man's treatment of Coleridge as a victim of self-mystification overlooks Coleridge's central problem as a negative theologian and as a poet: how to proclaim, without being able to perceive, the "Incomprehensible." The existentialisms of Nietzsche and Sartre, which de Man inherited, do away with this paradox by rendering it artificial: for Sartre, "the unreal is produced outside of the world by a consciousness which stays in the world"; likewise, Nietzsche affirms this doubleness as a legitimate human condition.11 But for Coleridge artificiality lay not in the paradox itself but in the neglect of the paradox, as it is embodied in scripture, by exegetes who "require some one or more particular passage from the Bible, that may at once illustrate and exemplify its applicability to the changes and fortunes of empires" (LS 660). Rather than reducing scripture to a political treatise (as eighteenth-century exegetes tended to) or regarding the paradox of the Incomprehensible as a mere self-mystification, Coleridge, like Kierkegaard, asserts human free will in the context of mystification?in the face of divine mystery. And it is in scripture's symbolic revelation of the divine that Coleridge finds a model for his poetry?a model that allows the poet to speak of himself in mystified but nonetheless authentic relationship with his God. The translation of this dual affirmation of the temporal and the infinite into a viable rhetorical strategy, however, presents a challenge for the poet. In the same way that his exegetical method revises the methods he inherits from preceding centuries, Coleridge's poetic method revises those inherited from the pre-Enlightenment forefathers he venerates such as the metaphysi cal poets and Milton. Like them, he champions symbolic organicism and shuns vapid tropes lacking symbolic or unitive potential. He also, as they do, expresses his faith through the rhetoric of self-effacement: in "The Eolian Harp," it is only the poet's final rejection of "Dim and unhallow'd" thoughts that allows him once again to "walk humbly with [his] God" (51, 52). But unlike the metaphysical poets, Coleridge's gestures of religious self-effacement maintain an emphasis on self. He writes that George Herbert's stanzas are especially affecting to me, because the folly of over-valuing myself in any reference to my future lot is not the sin or danger that il.

This, too, is perhaps where Coleridge and de Man part company: where de Man's poetic consciousness consists largely of a series of self-mystifications or attempts to hide from the non-self, Coleridge's depends on a self-respect that, Uke respect for scriptural aUe gory, makes possible a relationship with the divine. Thus, although Coleridge would probably agree with Stanley Fish that Herbert's re?gious-symboUc poems aim to absent the poet's voice even as it speaks, what he himself intends is a displacement or subordination of self rather than self-annihUation. Fish contends that Herbert successfuUy escapes the "egregiously self-assertive" writing of poetry by "making the experi ence of his poems the discovery of their true authorship"; that is, by attributing aU agency to God.13 The poet, inspired by God, is as Uttle responsible for his work as the writers of scripture were of theirs.14 But for Coleridge, a product of both the EnUghtenment and of Kantian thought, agency is not debatable: the human "1 am" is (ideaUy) asserted alongside the divine "1 am," at the expense of neither.15 Coleridge's own employment of "abstracted" typology was not a cele 12.

Ina Lipkowitz, in "Inspiration and the Poetic Imagination: Samuel Taylor Coleridge," SiR 30 (Winter 1991): 605-31, notes that Coleridge regarded the recorded visions in prophetic scripture to be, essentially, poetry, but that he also "denied any conscious artistry in prophetic vision" (626). The inverse of this passive process of writing divine revelation would be, as I am suggesting, an active reading of scripture toward the goal of rediscovering the symbolic divine. 15. Recent criticism, applying these metaphysics to literary production, has suggested that the eighteenth century's redefinition of writer as sole author, creator, and owner of a work is correlative to the development and implementation of copyright and patent laws. With this movement creative genius and its artistic products become the controllable "property" of the individual, rather than gifts from an inspiring God or Muse. Such developing notions of textual autonomy and ownership contribute to the new sense of freedom scriptural exegetes and secular writers display in their use (and, according to Coleridge, abuse) of biblical elements. For a discussion of eighteenth-century literary production regulations, see Martha Woodmansee's "The Genius and the Copyright: Economic and Legal Conditions of the Emergence of the 'Author,'" Eighteenth-Century Studies 17 (1983-84): 425-48.</page><page sequence="10">36 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO bration of it, but rather a demonstration of its potential heretical and ascriptural force. In both his early and late writings we see Coleridge reacting to misappropriations of scriptural images, and yet insisting that a degree of appropriation is integral to reading scripture and writing poetry correcdy. The end of misdirected "ownership" or use of scripture is the illumination or glorification of the temporal; the end of proper ownership (as with Pantisocracy) is a vision of the communal One. In the early poetry, Coleridge develops this dialectic primarily in rhetorical terms. We will find that for Coleridge, the approximation of the communal one (rhetoricized as the "multeity-in-unity" of the poetic symbol) must begin and end in the "private property" of self-consciousness (rhetorically, allegory), just as scripture begins and ends in historical fact: The Gospel is not a system of theology, nor a syntagma of theoretical propositions and conclusions for the enlargement of speculative knowledge, ethical or metaphysical. But it is a history, a series of facts and events related or announced. These do indeed involve, or rather, I should say they at the same time are, most important doctrinal truths. . . .16 II Coleridge criticism typically distinguishes allegory from the "true" Cole ridgean mode, symbol; allegory's purpose is typically marginalized or sub ordinated. As one critic has written, "allegory was not, for Coleridge, a poetic form appropriate to the One Life; rather, it was peculiarly adapted to expose and explore critically the world of illusions, divisions, and false-consciousness. "17 Jean-Pierre Mileur counters such efforts to delimit Coleridgean allegory, pointing instead to its potential transcendence and autonomy and to its presence in more than one poetic mode: The Conversation Poem turns on the possibilities and limitations of what can be projected onto the external world. In effect, the mode hopes to convince that the capacity of the world to signify, to attract meaning to itself, exceeds the capacity of self-consciousness to name or give meaning to the diversity of self-experience. Thus, the allegory of self-experience conditioned by despair, or loss, or isolation is inter rupted and shown to be a part of a more inclusive, benevolent allegory. . . .

Poet and world aUegorize one another. This double gesture accurately reflects the porousness of a Coleridgean "text" where the poet is often both agent and subject of his own rhetoric, potentiaUy "aUegorized by the interstices of his own aUegory." Like de Man, M?eur acknowledges the potential victimization of the poet by the poet's own rhetoric. However, M?eur resists de Man's con clusion that Coleridge beUeved symbol to be a real rather than an ideal aspect of poetry, "that Coleridge was unaware that symbol was not a description of [poetic] practice" (M?eur 22). M?eur regards aUegory, not symbol, to contain the most real poetic potential for Coleridge?and, by the same token, the most real poetic danger. MUeur points out the conse quences of Coleridge's 1818 formulation of aUegory, where "difference is everywhere presented to the eye or imagination wh?e Ukeness is suggested to the mind" (MC 7): wh?e this aUegory evokes the wiUed synthesizing agency of the imagination, it also "promotes a process of self-abstraction, tending toward a sense of the mind's unreaUty that is, paradoxicaUy, born of the contemplation of the mind's apparent power to create meanings out of itself more or less at wiU" (M?eur 21). Self, being fundamentaUy divided, is textual and therefore aUegorical; the bestowal of meaning upon the self is an act of reading the aUegory?of performing self-aUegoresis. This proc ess, M?eur suggests, risks the usurpation of the creative self by the textual self. But, as we wiU see, it is precisely from the perspective of the divisive or aUegorical consciousness (divisive both in itself and in relation to the world) that Coleridge can strain toward a unified, divine totaUty. In Chapter xn of the Biographia Literaria Coleridge insists that it is only through a fundamental act of self-division that the totaUty of the "sum" may be reaUzed: "We begin with the 1 know myself, in order to end with the absolute iam. We proceed from the self, in order to lose and find aU self in god" (BL i: 283). The translation of this dictum into artistic or rhetorical terms would have the poet beginning with the "1 know myself" of aUegory in order to end with the absolute "1 am" of symbol. AUegory is 18.

In the conversation poems, closure often occurs with the voluntary relinquishing of a natural symbol. In "The Nightingale," for instance, the bird's departure is temporary and comforting: "... fare well, a short farewell! / We have been loitering long and pleasandy, / And now for our dear homes" (88-90). Similarly, in "Fears in Solitude" the speaker turns homeward "Remembering thee, O green and silent dell! / And grateful, that by nature's quietness / And solitary musings, all my heart / Is softened ..." (228-31). That the poems conclude in deference to the natural symbol emphasizes the speaker's separateness from it, but also suggests a prior communion with it. In the mystery mode, however, the natural symbol is more emphatically transformed into an aspect of the human psyche which is less easily relinquished. The mystery poems typi cally conclude by situating both speaker and reader in a sort of never-never land of irresolution. The Mariner spins his predicament out into an in definite future: "Since then, at an uncertain hour, / That agony returns: / And till my ghasdy tale is told, / This heart within me burns" (582-85); the Wedding Guest "went like one that hath been stunned" (622); "Chris tabel'"s "gende minstrel bard" is ousted by the Baron: " 'Why Bracy! dost though loiter here? / I bade thee hence!' The bard obeyed" (651?52). Because the human psyche cannot be abandoned by retiring to one's cot, these poems are commonly supplemented by a structurally extrinsic figure?"Christabel"'s spectating and commenting narrator, "The Ancient Mariner"'s scholarly glosser?who can lament or ponder the uncomfortable mystery of the unself-conscious.20 Both genres demand the presence, however immediate or removed, of an identifiable figure (or voice) of control who will accept responsibility for the evaporation or obliqueness of the central image or narrative event. A consequence of this demand for manifested poetic agency is that it 19. In English Romantic Irony (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1980), Anne MeUor points out that Coleridge's notion of "progression"?in both the artistic and spiritual senses?is traceable to Schlegel, whose argument in "Dialogue on Poetry" equates reality not to being but to becoming (7). 20. There are, of course, more practical reasons for the late appearance of "The Ancient Mariner"'s gloss. Jerome McGann's "The Meaning of the Ancient Mariner," Critical Inquiry 8 (Autumn 1981): 35-67, argues that the 1817 addition of the gloss completes the process of "modernization" that is begun in 1800 with the stylistic revision of the poem's Arguments for the second edition of Lyrical Ballads. The task is seemingly motivated by Wordsworth's criticism that the poem, in its original form, is more of a Uterary baUad than a lyrical one (40).</page><page sequence="13">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 39 impUcates the poet in two roles: as an internal "reader" of his own poem who comments on the poem's thematics, and as a structural device, a rhetorical trope, which "comments on" (i.e. completes) the poem's rhe torical structure. The poet is both reader and trope: the aUegorizer is aUegorized. But aUegory is, potentiaUy, a seduction to power and auton omy, an extraction of self from context and an attempt to self-create. The clangers of this, for Coleridge, echo the clangers of reading scriptural figures in isolation, or applying bibUcal types to human antitypes. AU such gestures risk idolatry. As de Man notes the perils of exclusively seeking symbol, Coleridge marks the hazards of aUegory in isolation?in w?led separation from the divine symbol of which it is a type. These hazards are fuUy deUneated in "The EoUan Harp." Written in 1795, shortly after the dissipation of Pantisocracy, the poem negotiates between human ideaUsm (both artistic and spiritual) and human limitation. As a biographical remark and as a rhetorical demonstration, the poem is a bubble that gutters as it rises and breaks. Indeed, most critical readings of the poem concern themselves with the structural and thematic break of the finale, which introduces and seemingly affirms Christianity at the expense of the pantheistic harp metaphor, which is, in the last sixteen Unes, entirely absent.21 Kelvin Everest proposes that it is the ambiguity of the harp metaphor itself that has caused so much critical speculation as to which "ph?osophy" the harp(s) represent, and excuses the vagueness of the image on the foUowing grounds: This is the crucial point; the ph?osophical passages in the poetry are at once statements of beUef, and attempts to register emotions at a high pitch, that is to say, they are expressive of feeling. And Coleridge cannot be expected to have estabUshed a language that can adequately express, at one and the same time, both a ph?osophical speculation and the whole state of mind, with its antecedent inteUectual and emotional development, that enabled him to feel confident in the presence of a benevolent divinity (210).22 21. Mellor, for instance, points to Sara as the disappointing "embodiment of social respectability" who cannot (or does not) join the poet in his languid, libidinous reverie: his "pantheistic vision of a single life force energizing all living things is immediately rejected by . . . Sara, the voice of logic, understanding, conventional morality, and Coleridge's own uneasy conscience" (154). Likewise, Laurence Lockridge, in Coleridge the Moralist (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1977), reads the poem as one of Coleridge's crises of faith; for him the poem illustrates both a Christian and Cartesian dualism, in response to which the poet attempts intellectual and imaginative assertions of a superseding monism?only to ultimately condemn himself as heretical (89). 22. According to Everest, the harp's passivity potentially represents philosophical dispo sitions as diverse as Priesdey's mechanistic Unitarianism and Cudworth's neoplatonism. See Coleridge's Secret Ministry (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1979) 203-4.</page><page sequence="14">40 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO However, what Coleridge "cannot be expected to have established" in language, according to Everest, is precisely what the poet observes in himself; he writes in a December 1796 letter to Thelwall that "my philo sophical opinions are blended with, or deduced from, my feelings" (CL 1 #164). The same conflation of the philosophical and the emotional in the figure of the harp makes the image multiply referential, as Everest argues. But does this multiple referentiality necessarily render the poem thematically unsound? In other words, did the poet seek to establish a pantheistic "language that can adequately express, at one and the same time, both a philosophical speculation and the whole state of mind," or did he seek to adequately express the impossibility of recording such a moment of whole ness? Lending credence to the latter theory is the poem's history of revision. John Spencer Hill notes that in the earliest versions of the poem, the harp was a suitable symbol for Coleridge to employ given his Necessitarian and Lockean postures during this period.23 But after 1800, as Hill points out, Coleridge's developing notion of the mind as an active participant in the process of perception increasingly renders the harp an insufficient metaphor for the imaginative process. Given these circumstances it is curious that the harp, as the poem's central rhetorical construct, survives the numerous revisions, especially considering Coleridge's ultimate rejection of the meta phor: "The mind does not resemble an Aeolian Harp, nor even a barrel organ turned by a stream of water. . . ."24 And, oddly, it is not until his 1817 revision of the poem for inclusion in Sibylline Leaves that Coleridge entities it "The Eolian Harp" (abandoning the original "Effusion"). It seems to me that Coleridge's insistence on preserving the harp as central image is an insistence on preserving an inadequate, or at best transient, symbol? one which must fall back into the allegorical "alienated consciousness" of the poem's controversial finale. It is the positing and failure of the lute as symbol that allows for the completion of the poem's structure and theme: the idea that symbol must be predicated upon allegory, that human visions of unity must be born of division and ultimately disintegrate into the same. The vocal address of the poem's opening line ("My pensive Sara!") introduces a divisive dual consciousness that will come full circle by the poem's end. The rupture between the speaker and his auditor is emphasized by descriptive nods toward otherness, opposition, and contrariety as they are observed in the allegorical "facts" of the natural surroundings.

(3-9) Paul Magnuson points out that the evening star is commonly Unked in Uterature with eroticism and generative love, but here the wisdom it potentiaUy designates can be gained only by a "parenthetical denial of the erotic and an affirmation of purity and innocence."25 The eroticism of the evening star "Shine[s] opposite" the innocence of the jasmine and myrtle (which are, incidentaUy, the flowers Eve tends to prior to her encounter with the serpent in Paradise Lost). This opposition, I think, is dehberate, and wiU not bear the "parenthetical denial" Magnuson prescribes as a way to move beyond the disruption of the early Unes to the "innocence" of the poem's central verses. Rather, the divorce of natural entities (jasmine and myrtle) from their signifieds (innocence and love) provides the neces sary disjunctive or aUegorical condition out of which can grow a symboUc vision where the emblems and their parenthetical meanings are wed. Hence the poem's inverted felix culpa, wherein the images of opposition inspire in the speaker an attempted return to a prelapsarian, symbolic honeymoon before he is recaUed, by Sara herself, to its termination. The symboUc force of verse paragraphs 2-4 is derived in large part from the harp's bibUcal overtones. In the Old Testament, the harp is played by David to exorcise the ev? spirits of Saul (1 Sam. 16:14?23), and it is frequently mentioned in the psalms as an instrument of active and fervent praise.26 By making the biblical harp aeohan, Coleridge abstracts it: he renders it passive, Ukens it to himself-as-speaker ("And thus, my Love! as on the midway slope / Of yonder hiU I stretch my Umbs at noon" [34-35]), and imbues it with secular and sexual meaning as it is "Placed length-ways in the clasping casement" and is "by the desultory breeze caress'd" (13, 14).

(Amos 6:4-5) As the grate-film suppUes the locus of self-inscription in "Frost at Mid night," the secularized harp here figures the poet stretched on the midway slope?his natural "couch"?inventing for himself an instrument of music. The risk here is self-idolatry, self-typology, spiritual masturbation: in short, heresy. To sidestep this risk, the symbol must be fashioned to fa?. Hence, the symbol is made to only temporarily mute the emblematic divisions that a successful (divine) symbol would definitively resolve. The harp harbors the co-presence of eroticism and innocence that the first Unes of the poem introduce. The "coy maid half yielding to her lover" (16), and by inference the lute, are neither exclusively active (erotic) nor exclu sively passive (innocent); they are, rather, passively active, eroticaUy inno cent, at once exercising their own wiU and being exercised by another's. Like de Man's aUegory, the maid "renounces the desire to coincide" (207) with her object; but (and this is, again, what de Man's argument itself renounces), impUcit in the admission of desire?in the maid's half-yield ing?is an admission of possible consummation, of possible symboUzation. The lute half-yields to and half-renounces its symboUc potential, and therefore the lute fa?s as symbol. For applying bibUcal types to the antitype of himself and his paradisiacal cot, the speaker wiU justifiably be rebuked. This is a dehberate set-up. Coleridge knows his symbol is impure; were it not, it "should have been impossible / Not to love aU things in a world so fiU'd" (30-31). The conditional force of these Unes aU but announces that the poem is a mock-symbo?c text and deserves to be read as such; therein Ues the poem's and the poet's salvation. We are provided a model reading, both by and of the poet's aUegorical consciousness in the last verse paragraph. Sara's "mud reproof" recaUs the poet into an environment of separation, non-coinci dental subjectivity and objectivity. The controUing consciousness precipi tandy shifts from the pantheistic ontology of the "inteUectual breeze, / At once the Soul of each, and God of aU" (47-48) to the hierarchical subor dination of human subject to divine object: the attempted symboUc reca pitulation of the "1 am," where conflation of subject and object is de manded by the eUded grammatical object, must be foregone for a return to the bisected identity of "1 know myself." The passive activity of the lute?receiving the breeze of the One Life of which it is a part?is reduced, in the language of reUgion, to either passivity or activity. The attempt to extract the ontological shim separating subject and object Ues fiiUy in the</page><page sequence="17">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 43 activity of the subject: the speaker deems God "The Incomprehensible! save when with awe / I praise him ..." (59-60; my emphasis). Likewise, the nonrestrictive clause which follows direcdy strips the speaker of his active role and renders him passive: God becomes he "who with his saving mercies healed me" (60-61; my emphasis).27 The thematic and grammatical appeal to hierarchy in this verse paragraph is a return from the central idea of the communal to the reality of ownership and possession that is established in the first lines (the newlyweds "sit beside our Cot, our Cot o'ergrown"). But in the poem's finale, the speaker pointedly acknowledges the divine source of all he possesses: I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels; Who with his saving mercies healed me, . . . and gave me to possess Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honour'd Maid! (60-64) The poet-speaker is required to surrender the "private property" of his mock-symbol, the biblical type appropriated and cast in terms of self, in order to reclaim his inly-feeling, linguistically (and therefore imperfecdy) expressed faith in the divine communal. Coleridge's poem, his counterfeit symbol, cannot be realized precisely because it is his. As with his prede cessors, the Metaphysical poets, Coleridge's redemption from this self-ag grandizing ownership occurs only when God is acknowledged as primary agent; but unlike them, Coleridge does not outright deny human poetic agency or possession. Although the origin of all ownership is acknowledged to be God, who "gave me to possess / Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honour'd Maid," the relationship between God and poet rests on a principle of exchange: human individuality in return for faith as expressed in imperfect praise. The human fragment is given value in this economy, but only if it is acknowledged to shadow, or potentially (but never actually) symbolize, the divine whole. Ill Like "The Eolian Harp," "Kubla Khan" experiments with imaginative absolutism. But while the former poem positively affirms the value of 27- In entry #3587 (The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. Kathleen Cobum [Princeton: Princeton UP, 1969], vol. 3), Coleridge writes that "A thing acts on me but not on me as purely passive, which is the case in all affection, affectus, but res agit in co-agen tem?in the first, I am thinged, in the latter I thing or think ..." (Coleridge's emphases). A similar transformation can be identified in the fourth and fifth verse paragraphs of "The Eolian Harp," where relative passivity is transferred from the poet (verse paragraph 4) to his Christian God (verse paragraph 5).</page><page sequence="18">44 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO relationality and hope, the latter does so negatively by exploring the conditions of alienation and fear. "The Eolian Harp "'s economy of own ership based on exchange is transmuted in "Kubla Khan" into an economy of ownership based on self-inflation. The final moments of "The Eolian Harp" find the speaker valuing his possessions because they have issued from God and will ultimately return to God: to possess is to anticipate surrender to the communal. But in "Kubla Khan" the mock-symbolic garden and pleasure dome, unlike the mock-symbolic harp, are not relin quished by their owner, Khan. Rather, they are appropriated by the poet-figure himself, who claims dominion over all dimensions of the poem?internally, the landscape and the visionary force that shapes it, and externally, the reader who experiences the poem and must regard the poet-figure with "holy dread" (52). "The Eolian Harp'"s anticipated sur render to God is replaced in "Kubla Khan" by the poet-figure's surrender to self. Along with "Christabel" (Part 1) and "The Ancient Mariner," Coleridge creates "Khan" during a period of financial and moral desperation. In October 1797 he complains that "I suppose that at last I must become a Unitarian minister as a less evil than starvation" (CL 1 #209). In early 1798 he is spared this "evil" by accepting the Wedgwood annuity. Coleridge justifies his ultimate acceptance of the annuity by regarding the arrange ment as a form of exchange; he writes to Poole in January, 1798 that "I long to be at home with you, and to settle, and persevere in, some mode of repaying the Wedge woods thro' the medium of Mankind" (CL 1 #228). Whether such a medium of reparation is, as Basil Willey calls it, "high minded casuistry" or genuine Christian beneficence is debatable, but Cole ridge's acceptance of the offer is clearly motivated by both religious prin ciple and artistic practice.28 Coleridge first declined the Wedgwoods' offer on the grounds that "I could by means of your kindness subsist for the two next years, &amp; enjoy leisure &amp; external comfort. But anxiety for the future would remain &amp; increase, as it is probable my children will come fast on me" (CL 1 #217). Accepting the second offer may indeed have incited in the poet some degree of guilt, or at least apprehension: indefinite "leisure &amp; external comfort," free of charge, could easily cultivate Khan like tendencies. Writing the poem, then, may have been for Coleridge a preventive measure; imagining the solipsistic extreme of his new artistic and financial freedom was perhaps negative self-encouragement to "defend that cause to which I have solemnly devoted my best efforts . . . and, as I have received the gospel freely, freely to give it" (CL 1 #224).

But why was it pubUshed at that time? Walter Bate, taking at face value Coleridge's 1816 labeUng of the poem as a "psychological curiosity" rather than worthy poetry, casts Cole ridge as a poetic weakUng motivated by practical circumstance and the condescending request of the then-celebrated Byron: "Timidly, as he tried to get some practical use out of what he had written earUer, he escorted it, as he was to escort so much by that time, with a cloud of apology."29 But 1816?17 was the period during which Coleridge wrote The Statesman's Manual and the Lay Sermons, some of his most pointed affirmations of the vital, Christian ph?osophy over mechanistic Spinozan ph?osophy. He was also revising "The EoUan Harp" for inclusion in Sibylline Leaves (1817). Given the pious mood and substance of the works Coleridge produced during this time, it seems possible that the pubUcation of "Kubla Khan" was strategic rather than accidental?that Coleridge sought to get some homUetic m?eage out of what, for the 1798 poet, may have been heretical, nihiUstic poetry. In the context of Coleridge's later works, the poem is no longer a transgression but an injunction against transgression; it is, in the language of the accompanying preface, the inverse yet "paraUel production of the correspondent expressions" (21-22) of Coleridge's mature prose. Both forewarn against the hazards of Mammon-worship, the dangers of secular, counterfeit symboUsm, and aUenation from the organic, divine symbo?sm of scripture. It is possible to argue that the poem does achieve authentic symbolic status. McGann, for instance, reads "Kubla Khan" as a symboUc moment of ideological commitment to unself-consciousness: The conceptual aspects of the poem are deUvered obUquely and unselfconsciously, through symbols. . . . The work compels a non rational form of assent to a latent structure of ideas; in the end, it urges the reader to swear aUegiance to the idea of non-rational and unself conscious forms of knowing. (Romantic Ideology 101) McGann's ideology of commitment deems the poem's final self-conscious moment to "sustain its own generative energy at the ideological level" (99); the conditionals that structure the final verse paragraph are signs of an "obUque fulfiUment" (99) rather than an admission of impossibiUty arising from a renewed aUegorical self-consciousness (which, incidentaUy, McGann does locate in later ph?osophical poems such as "Limbo" and "Ne Plus Ultra"). CaUing the poem "a direct representation, in emotional terms, of the human conflicts which are necessarily involved in [human] relations" 29- Walter Jackson Bate, Coleridge (New York: MacMillan, 1968) 84.</page><page sequence="20">46 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO (104), McGann sees in the poem's tension the universal dynamic of human hope and fear: the poet, daring to hope for restored vision, simultaneously fears the annihilation of vision, voice, and self. McGann proposes that to conquer the fear shadowing the first thirty-six lines, the poet self consciously affirms the symbolically potent unself-consciousness for which he hopes. The poem's last lines, then, are not a relinquishing of the commitment to unself-consciousness, but rather a distanced prophesy that "visionary power has returned and will continue to do so" (100). While I agree with McGann that the final verse paragraph is infused with and controlled by visionary power, it seems that the kind of visionary power fathomed is not hope-fulfillment but rather, and quite emphatically, hope's opposite: dread. The darkness of the preceding "vision" is super imposed onto its agent?the shadow finds its source?and the result is that the poet-figure himself becomes the object of fear: "... all should cry, Beware, Beware! / His flashing eyes, his floating hair! / Weave a circle round him thrice, / And close your eyes with holy dread" (49-52). The floating dome is grounded, finally, in the self as object of fear rather than in the divine as object of hope. For McGann, the poem's affirmations are meaningful "not for their Truth-value?but because they are part of the poem's specific human content?for their truth-value" (103). But it seems to me that the poem's negation of divine Truth-value is precisely what makes it not an affirmation, but a self-admonition against "the counterfeit product of the mechanical understanding, which in the blindness of self complacency confounds Symbols with Allegories" (LS 30). With a distincdy Unitarian and pantheistic anxiety that pits Truth-value against truth-value, Coleridge writes in October 1797 that I can contemplate nothing but parts, &amp; parts are all little?!?My mind feels as if it ached to behold &amp; know something great?something one &amp; indivisible?and it is only in the faith of this that rocks or waterfalls, mountains or caverns give me the sense of sublimity or majesty!?But in this faith all things counterfeit infinity! (CL 1 #209) Remarks such as this presage Coleridge's later subscription to Trinitarian ism, which is finally the only viable alternative to the pantheism that we see here crumbling into "parts." "Kubla Khan" is carved out of the same rocks, waterfalls, mountains, and caverns that inspire the poet's faith in the "one &amp; indivisible," but these elements, as they appear in the poem, also betray the poet's denunciation of a pantheistic faith that makes "all things counterfeit infinity." Indeed, "Kubla Khan" is the artistic creation of such a counterfeit infinity. It is not, finally, an assertion of hopeful visionary power, but a didactic warning against the misuse of such power, against the dangerous counterfeit ideology that posits self as antitype to God.</page><page sequence="21">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 47 The poem's preface first estabUshes a counterfeit symboUc translucence wh?e giving the verse to foUow its apparent symboUc force. Although it provides a context for the poem, it serves also, and more effectively, to decontextualize. In the poem's extremely de-centering tide?"Kubla Khan: Or a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment"?and the curiously anecdotal introduction, we are told that the foUowing verse is not only a fragment, but a fragment of a vision experienced in a dream by a person in "?l health" and under the influence of an anodyne. This experiential layering and distancing absents voUtion, but not poetic agency, making the poet both the recumbent instrument of some mystified source and also the source itself. "The author" slept for three hours, during which time he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred Unes; if that indeed can be caUed composition in which aU the images rose up before him as things, with a paraUel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort. (17-22) The artifact's inception is primarily (but not exclusively) non-linguistic, making it seem, at first, symboUc: the presence of the images is immediate, unhampered by inteUectual or physical effort or temporal constraints. But then appears that bothersome "paraUel production of the correspon dent expressions," the Unguistic accompaniment from which the poet salvages what remains of the much lengthier original. That the images are somehow necessarily connected, or at least co-present, to their Unguistic signifiers renders the verse to foUow a remnant of an originary aUegorical "picture language" and affirms the value of aUegorical art. This affirmation is, however, conditional, for although the now-absent origin of the "poem" is professedly aUegorical, it is effectively obscured and re-mystified: "... yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered Unes and images, aU the rest had passed away Uke the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration of the latter!" (30-34). Coleridge has, for the moment, mystified aUegory. But in the next rhetorical pirouette, a bit of Coleridge's poem "The Picture" is inserted into the preface, promising that when the aUe gorical images and words disseminate, Then aU the charm Is broken?aU that phantom-world so fair Vanishes, and a thousand circlets spread, And each mis-shapes the other. Stay awh?e, Poor youth! who scarcely dar'st lift up thine eyes?</page><page sequence="22">48 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO The stream wiU soon renew its smoothness, soon The visions wiU return! And lo, he stays, And soon the fragments dim of lovely forms Come trembUng back, unite, and now once more The pool becomes a mirror. (35-44) Strangely, the verse laments the absence of the comforting dual-aspect of the aUegorical vision. Further, the vision prophesied to return is, sig nificandy, a vision of self: the misshaping circlets of the kaleidoscopic preface wiU ultimately resolve themselves into a mirror, which wiU restore "aU the charm" of the aUegorical self-consciousness. This is a prophecy of self-incarnation; the youth is encouraged not to "Uft up [his] eyes" heav enward, but rather to direct them earthward and, Narcissus-Uke, anticipate the antitype of himself as projected by nature. Both the mirror into which the poet peers and the image beheld are the figure of Khan. Appraisals of the Khan as historical (rather than divine) range from Beer's conception of him as a hedonistic tyrant who selfishly devises an inauthentic paradise to Bloom's more forgiving portrait of an artist who strives to reify the elusive forms of truth and beauty.30 But that Coleridge also intends to suggest the deific and potentiaUy symboUc nature of Khan is evident in Khan's first and only act, his decree. The wording of this act differs sUghdy but cruciaUy from that of its source, Purchas's Pilgrimage, which reads "In Xanadu did Cublai Can build 2. stately Palace" (my emphasis). Coleridge's Khan's method of production is verbal rather than physical. This abstracts Khan from the realm of blood, sweat, and tears and fixes him, Uke the God of Genesis, somewhere outside of his creation. McGann's reading of Khan paraUels the poet/creator to God/Creator, but maintains that their domains are distincdy divergent: "The master of this historical potentate is the Idea which he embodies, and final mastery Ues with those who create and master the world of Ideas: God, ultimately, but in the mortal sphere the manipulators of the creative imagination" (102). This scheme seems a bit too pat considering the complexity of Coleridge's theory of imagination, not to mention his chronic despair of mastery of any sort. For Coleridge, the manipulation of the imagination is not a means of ascendancy but of potential heresy. To "lose and find aU self in God" demands an equation of God and self that could eas?y degenerate into self-idolatry.31 30. See Harold Bloom, The Visionary Company: A Reading of English Romantic Poetry (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1971) 217-20, and John Beer, Coleridge the Visionary (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1970) 222-29. 31. This tension further establishes Coleridge as a descendant of the seventeenth-century metaphysical poets; it echoes Herbert's unremitting desire to annihilate himself as author, and Fish's insistence that such annihilation is artistically achievable.</page><page sequence="23">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 49 In spite of the poem's idolatrous overtones, Bate utterly denies any correlation between the created object, Khan's pleasure dome, and the temples of Christianity, asserting that any "association of the great religious domes of Christianity?of Byzantium and St. Peter's?is aesthetic, relevant only because of magnitude and splendor. . . . The religious censor in Coleridge, even at this stage of his life, is as strong as it was in Johnson" (79). The poem does indeed censor, but it does so through the misappro priation and restructuring of Christian tropes rather than through the avoidance of them. Along these lines, Elinor Shaffer has suggested that "Kubla Khan" is a type of "mythological doubling," an exploration of how Christianity subsumes and diffuses the elements of primitive myth?how Christianity is "Hellenism developed and ordered."32 Like McGann, Shaffer reads the poem as an affirmative salvaging of vision. But for Shaffer, the poem is laden with Truth-value, and the poet's vision figures St. John's revelation "in that John is both he who comes closest to the god and he who in the lightning knows his own incapacity" (176). But in reading the poem's visionary finale as a positive representation of the apocalypse, Shaffer neglects the dark impact of the poem's false prophecy and ascrip tural apocalypse. Rather than paralleling scripture, the poem negates it: it encourages us to feel the spiritual and biblical voids and to crave their supplementation, but not to pretend that the voids do not exist. Part of what makes the poem ascriptural is its atemporal, imagistic suspension. Reading the poem is like peering into a crystal ball: the images hover, decontextualized and encircled, before the eye of the imagination, while the sense of their remoteness is in no way diminished. Likewise, the poem's imagistic immediacy is in no way abated by its patent situation in the past tense (a situation which, as Coleridge complains in the Lay Sermons, makes scripture susceptible to stricdy historical, and therefore reductive, readings). The poet has managed to construct a "visionary" artifact that announces its own temporal restriction without calling atten tion to this restriction. It is "Through caverns measureless to man" that "Alph, the sacred river, ran" (3-4; my emphasis): how can the river be placed in time but not space? Similarly, the reader experiences vague unrest when "with ceaseless turmoil" the "fountain momently was forced" (17, 19): does "momently" mean "briefly"? "not now, but soon"? "eter nally, atemporally"? Such juxtaposing of the immediate and the tensed contributes to, rather than undermines, the poem's abstractness; throughout the first and second verse paragraphs the tensing is so consistent and understated that it is eclipsed by the turbulence and strength of the imagery. Only when the poetic self-consciousness overtly claims an agent in verse 32. E. S.

In the same way that the verbal past tense subtly contextuaUzes a scenario that claims to be decontextuaUzed, the bibUcal types through which the poem is filtered struggle to find antitypes in a landscape that contains nothing even approaching symboUc translucence. The God and the Para dise of Genesis; the temple of Ezekiel, which "had a waU around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common" (Ez. 42:20); the "ancestral voices" of the Babylonian kings "prophesying war" against Jerusalem (Ez. 24:2); the waiUng whore of Babylon herself?these bibUcal images recast in pagan molds would provoke in Coleridge's ideal Christian reader the same kind of disquiet as does the juxtaposing of the tensed and the abstract. The unava?ab?ity of divinely inscribed antitypes forces the types to refer instead to the temporal, the mechanical; thus the disturbed result is due not only to the presence of the mechanistic imagery?the inert, spiritless Khan, the pleasure dome and its "waUs and towers . . . girdled round" (7), the disembodied war-cries (30), the disembodied wa?ings (16)?but to the absence of the organic or divine antitypes conjured and expected by any reader famiUar with scripture. The elements of the poem, divorced from the scriptural sources, fa? to find their proper fulfillment. Instead, they turn into "fragments vaulting] Uke rebounding hail" (21); they cannot escape the bastardization of Eden that is Xanadu, they cannot refer to anything outside of themselves, they cannot organicaUy "mean." Xanadu is the realm of a god who simulates the Spinozan god, characterized by Thomas McFarland as mindless and souUess, vast and blank. ... In the system of Spinoza we are here not as inhabitants, bright even in our faU, of a world created for us by a loving and merciful God, whose image we see in our own likeness, but we are cast adrift, momentary and insignificant particles in the vast, bUnd efflux of deity.33 Without the anchor of the anthropomorphic, biblical deity, human vessels (Uke the poem's tropes) become "fragments vaulting] Uke rebounding ha?," denied the power of wiUed self-direction. What results is not an immortal course that strives to reaUze the "1 am," but instead a "forced" 33- Thomas MacFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition (Oxford: Clarendon, 1969) 70.</page><page sequence="25">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 51 progression that is undirected, haphazard, and finally static. The poet's fear of "sink[ing] into the chaos and lawless productivity of my own still perishing yet imperishable nature" (CL vi #1524) is figured in the sacred river, which . . . flung up momendy . . . Five miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean . . . (24-28) In its eventual stagnancy, the river that courses through the intricate yet abstracdy "measureless" landscape represents Coleridge's dark moment of pantheism. And Khan's autonomous, materially possessive relationship to the measureless incurs the sort of lifeless (anti) climax that was the stillbirth of Pantisocracy (significandy, Coleridge attributed Pantisocracy's collapse in part to Southey's "increased pertinacity for the Wisdom of making Self an undiverging Center" [CL 1 #93]). Any autonomous gesture?artistic or material?toward recreating Eden is a God-act; it thereby enacts the self idolatry that caused the fall and, in turn, the need to reclaim or rebuild Eden. Such gestures, creative or otherwise, are circular and doomed to fail. "Kubla Khan "'s last verse paragraph enacts this circularity by executing its own, self-contained prophetic typology. In a poem built on (or hovering over) the disjunction between its tropes and their referents, the seemingly disjunctive transformation that occurs in the space between the penultimate and final stanzas is not all that surprising. But it has, nevertheless, made for substantial critical confusion. The school of Edward Bostetter (including Magnuson, Mackenzie, and Berkoben) has successfully advanced the argu ment that the poem's culmination is Coleridge's nod toward failure, an admission that he was indeed incapable of sustaining the poetic heights achieved in the poem's first thirty-six lines. Contra this negative reading, McGann hears the voice of self-assertion and ideological commitment; the finale is "a dramatic representation of imagination's own self-renovating powers" (100). And Anne Mellor remarks that the alleged fragmentation of the poem safeguards the poet against moral indictment by "hostile" readers; perhaps the now-absent 150-200 lines?the maid's symphony and song??would have chastised the vision of the extant remainder and re stored the reader's faith (157-58). Each hypothesis acknowledges the voice of self-consciousness striving to either affirm an achievement or salvage a failure. In his admitted inability to "revive within me / Her symphony and</page><page sequence="26">52 CLAIRE MILLER COLOMBO song," the poet seems at first to be returning to the aUegorical present from a counterfeit-symboUc eternity by postulating the "pastness" of the dam sel-vision. Momentarily, the poet turns a "symboUc" visionary moment into a text to be critiqued?as do the prophets of the Old Testament who, in recording their visions, transform them into historical texts or accounts. But instead of only referring back to the vision of Unes 1-36, the pro phetic-poetic persona abstracts the vision's imagery, superimposing it onto a new vision of self-apotheosis: Could I revive within me Her symphony and song, To such a deep deUght 'twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would bu?d that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice! And aU who heard should see them there, And aU should cry, Beware! Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread, For he on honey-dew hath fed, And drunk the m?k of Paradise. (42-54) In this apocalypse, we see "fragments dim of lovely forms": the cacopho nous "woman wa?ing for her demon-lover" is figured as the Abyssinian maid's "symphony and song"; Khan has become the poet ("I would bu?d that dome in air"); the poet, engirded and with "floating hair," embodies the dome itself; Xanadu is now a sorcerer's Paradise. The image seems almost to be the photographic negative of one presented in an earlier poem, where . . . God, methought, Had buUt him there a temple: the whole World Seemed imag'd in its vast circumference, No wish profan'd my overwhelmed heart. Blest hour! It was a luxury,?to be! ("Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement" 38-42) "Kubla Khan "'s prophecy, in which the poet bu?ds himself a temple and where everything is imaged in his self-circumference, is indeed a wish profane. Instead of returning to the aUegorical self-consciousness that ac knowledges its own contingency, the poet-figure makes his "Self an undi verging Center." Indeed, the poet-figure is the object of his own prophecy:</page><page sequence="27">COLERIDGE'S ANIMATION OF THE "DEAD LETTER" 53 in a travesty of allegorical temporality, he refers "back" to Khan while projecting "forward" to self-as-Khan. A victim of its own enclosure and self-referentiality, the poem's biblical typology stagnates?much like the counterfeit symbolism of the lute in "The Eolian Harp," which in its idle passivity cannot, finally, convey translucence. But as we have seen, "The Eolian Harp" is designed to admit its own incapacities. The poem's rhetorical structure is tripartite: the counterfeit symbol of the central verse paragraphs evolves out of and dissolves back into allegorical self-consciousness. This rhetorical surrendering of imagina tive absolutism enables the poet to maintain an anticipation of the symbolic, communal divine. "Kubla Khan," on the other hand, ignores imaginative limits rather than enforces them, and thereby prophecies the consequences of counterfeit art that borrows from scripture without admitting its scrip tural origins. The poem's open-endedness leaves the reader craving both rhetorical and thematic resolution, and in doing so implicitly calls for the kind of model "reading" provided by the final stanza of "The Eolian Harp." "Kubla Khan"'s invitation is not subtle; the imperative "Weave a circle round him thrice, / And close your eyes with holy dread" draws even unwilling readers into the realm of "dim and unhallow'd" thoughts, and endows them with the power and the responsibility to complete (texere: to weave) the inscription that is the poem. And yet, no sooner have we thus supplemented and affirmed the poem as a form of egotistical self-praise than we are asked to "close [our] eyes with holy dread"?to negate it and, like Sara, to "holily dispraise" the dreadful "shapings of the unregenerate mind." While "The Eolian Harp" comes with its own final self-conscious moment, the reader must supply "Kubla Khan'"s. In Coleridge's dialectic, this moment consists of rejecting the poem's counterfeit symbolism and affirming the scriptural symbolism that the poem itself first appropriates and then rejects. By eliciting such a reading without actually representing it, the poem enables its Christian poet and Christian reader to avoid the "blindness of self-complacency [that] confounds Symbols with Allegories" (LS 30); by driving us to revive within ourselves the damsel's symphony and song, Coleridge makes us "inly feel" our faith, which then becomes, he hopes, a true expression of praise, a legitimate type of the singing of the heavenly choir gathered about the throne of God. Peering into the mirror (or crystal ball) and glimpsing the horrors of faith that "in the present age ... is either to be buried in the dead letter, or its name and honours usurped by a counterfeit product of the mechanical understanding" (LS 30), poet and reader are invited to shatter the image and continue on their mortal course.
