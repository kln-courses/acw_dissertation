<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTERl6 A Neopalatial Shrine Model from the Minoan Peak Sanctuary at Gournos Krousonas by George Rethemiotakis In December 2003, the present writer, in conjunction with the Herakleion Ephorate, excavated a small peak sanctuary on Mt. Gournos near Krou sonas.1 Gournos is one of the highest peaks of the Psiloritis mountain range on the Herakleion side (+1,300 masl), craggy and unapproachable on its east, facing Krousonas. The only means of ascent to the peak is from the west via the small mountain plain at Livadi, one and one-half hours distant by foot on rough and difficult rocky terrain. The craggy mountain of Gournos (Fig. 16.1:1) lies just at the entrance passage from the Krousonas gorge (Faragi), which leads to Zominthos and the Idaean Cave (Fig. 16.1:5). At this point, at the foot of the moun tain, lies a Minoan settlement, one house of which has been excavated.2 Other open-air places of worship have been located or excavated in the wider region of the pass toward Psiloritis. At the site of Tou Papa to Spiti (Fig. 16.1:2) on the north incline of the Krousonas gorge, a concentration of fragments of animal figurines was recovered near a Minoan building visible on the surface.3 Another small peak sanctuary that yielded many anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines was also excavated 5 km west of Gournos, at the small upland plain of Pentacheri on the knoll Korphi tis Kerias (Fig. 16.1:3).4 Traces of large Minoan buildings are visible at this location. An open-air sanctuary of the Hellenistic period was excavated roughly 5 km to the north, at the site of Kinigotaphkos on the north side of Mount Voskero (Fig. 16.1:4). It yielded many bovine figurines and a clay model of a shield, all placed around a rock on the edge of a deep chasm.5 Though unexcavated, three caves containing Neolithic to Late Minoan (LM) III sherds have also been located. The sherds include fragments of a large LM IIIC krater with a depiction of horns and double axes. This dense concentration of sites with strong evidence of ritual activ ity, located along the length of the gorge en route to the central massif of Psiloritis, must represent the activities of worshipers who made their way, from Minoan to Greek times, from settlements and towns of north central Crete toward the most important sacred cave of Crete, the Idaean Cave. The site of the sanctuary on the Gournos mountain, at its highest point, is named Korphi tou Tarou. It has the shape of two rocky outcrops about 1.

These two outcrops lie on the edge of the precipice, the great height of which allows a panoramic view of the plain of Herakleion, Mt. Juktas, and the Lasithi massif (Fig. 16.2:a). Figure 16.1.

GOURNOS SANCTUARY Despite the immediate intervention of the Ephoreia, the sanctuary had already been largely robbed (Fig. 16.3). Deposits that escaped the attention of the robbers, however, were located and excavated in crevices of the rocks. The excavation started out with three sectors, labeled numerically S1-S3 (see Fig. 16.2), in areas where the main concentrations of pottery and other finds were located. The most southerly rock outcrop had a roughly circular surface where a thin layer of black earth with traces of fire was preserved. The pottery is exclusively of Hellenistic date. This is probably evidence of rituals taking place many hundreds of years after the main period of use in Minoan times, and will be examined in the future. A similar phenomenon has been noted elsewhere.6 Under the fire debris, a few Minoan sherds, chiefly from conical cups, were collected: an anthropomorphic head (see Fig. 16.10, below), part of a dress from a female figurine, and some small animal figurines. The main focus of ritual in Minoan times was on the northern out crop (S2), which yielded an important accumulation of pottery and other 6.

Papadakis Sherds of similar drinking vessels and a few fragments of animal figu rines were found on level ground between the two outcrops (S3), along with tripod cooking pot legs, showing that food preparation took place at this particular spot. Perhaps it was here that the visitors stayed during their visit to the sanctuary, in makeshift installations, cooking and consuming food in the open air during their sojourn. A SHRINE MODEL FROM THE SANCTUARY The most important find of the excavation comes from sector S2. It is a circular shrine model, the fragments of which were collected from one of the rock crevices and the earth of the illicit excavation (Figs. 16.13-16.15).9 It has not been possible to mend this object. Since the fragments belonging to it include areas of the base and main structure as well as areas of the entrance and roof, its restoration is feasible, however. It is presented here in roll-out form (Fig. 16.13) and fully restored (Fig. 16.14). The incised decoration has not been included in the reconstructions since not enough evidence remains to restore it. From the pieces preserved, it appears that the model was entirely covered with brown-black paint. It bore relief decoration of ropelike bands around the eaves and around a circular opening in the top of the roof, the existence of which is documented by the modeling of the sherd above and 9. Yellowish clay on the surface, with pink core (Diam. ca. 20.0 cm, H. ca. 22.0 cm).</page><page sequence="8">196 GEORGE RETHEMIO TA KI S j^j^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ behind the relief band. It also had vertical relief bands between the eaves of the roof and the base, two of which are preserved, one of them detached. In addition, the upper right part of the entrance opening is preserved, along with a small part of the threshold. A small gamma-shaped fragment, which does not join but is made of the same clay, probably comes from the seat and leg of a chair, decorated with plastic and incised details and secured or placed on the floor of the shrine. A head of a female figure with a hat (Fig. 16.16), found in the same spot and also made of the same clay, belongs to a figurine that may have occupied the seat. A point of particular interest is that at the spot corresponding to the right-hand corner of the door above the eaves there are attached horns of consecration with incised decoration, broken at the points. For reasons of symmetry, another similar pair of horns was probably positioned on the left side of the entrance (as restored in the drawing; see Fig. 16.14), and there may have been a row of horns above the eaves along its full length. One clear hole on the roof, at a spot that corresponds to the axis between the pair of horns, may have been used for plant stalks (as perhaps were others in the unpreserved part of the roof). Plant stalks are linked with horns of consecration in representations.10 This model is the oldest in a series of similar circular hut models that come chiefly from household assemblages and date from LM IIIA (the Kato Zakros model) to Protogeometric B (a model in the Giamalakis Col lection from Archanes, the only one that comes from a tomb).11 Stylianos Alexiou mentions another possible model with a handle from AyiaTriada; he dates this object to LM LA.12 The circular model presented here is not only the oldest of the series, testifying to the existence of the type from the beginning of the Neopalatial period, but it was also certainly for religious use, since it was found at a sanctuary and bears the symbol of the horns of consecration. This proves Figure 16.13. Roll-out plan and section of the shrine model. Scale 1:3. Drawing K. Astrinaki 10. See for instance the bronze plaque from the Diktaian Cave (Board man 1961, p. 46). It is particularly interesting that the proposed combina tion of the horns with plants in the model matches depictions of circular shrines on seals (see below), which also combine horns of consecration with plant stalks in between; Onassoglou 1985, pi. X:8-10. 11. Hagg 1990; Mersereau 1993. For the provenance and different inter pretations of the hut in the Giamalakis Collection, see Sakellarakis 1987. 12. Alexiou 1950, p. 451.

Scale 1:1. Photos I. Papadakis that it constitutes a model not merely of a circular structure of unspecified use, but of a circular shrine that probably housed a seated figurine. The existence of circular shrines was first proposed by Arthur Evans on the basis of a series of representations on talismanic seals. Some of these depict a construction with vertical supports and an inclined roof or with pediment and framing of horns of consecration, plant motifs, and snakes.13 Other researchers have denied the existence of such shrines. The clay hut models are sometimes interpreted as an abstract and conventional render ing of a sacred house, without real architectural counterparts,14 its shape perhaps influenced by ceramic forms such as the cylindrical pyxis.15 There are comparable types of circular furnishings and shrines in Italy, Germany, and Scandinavia, as well as in the Levant, all dating from the Bronze to Iron Ages. It is not, however, likely that they have a common morphological and functional origin, since they were not all used in the same way, nor are they contemporary.16 In this instance, it can be demonstrated that the hut model type is purely Cretan. Its beginnings are traceable to the 17th century B.C., according to the evidence from the excavation context of the hut published here. Moreover, if we consider the circular hut from the Early Minoan (EM) I-IIA Lebena tomb, recently published, which has all the functional architectural characteristics of a normal house, namely a door, windows, and a raised, perforated chimney, then it is likely that real construc tions of this type existed before the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C.17 13.

Just like the model from Lebena and the latest chronological example in the Giamalakis Collection, it has an entranceway and hole in the roof, i.e., a kind of chimney. The vertical relief bands that link the eaves with the base appear to depict real wooden beams, namely, the framework of a hut made from wood and branches. This is just what Evans hypothesized concerning the construction of the rustic shrines depicted on seal stones.18 The gaps in the framework could have been filled either with skins or thin horizontal wooden slats and a coating of clay, decorated with painted or inscribed motifs such as those seen on the surface of our model. The relief and incised decoration of the models is very reminiscent of the representations on talismanic seal stones referred to above. The depictions on the seals have a system of horizontal, oblique, or zigzag bands amid vertical stalks (posts, according to Evans) and cross-hatched bands on the roof, just like the model published here. This obvious resemblance provides additional support for Evans's view that the so-called shrines on the seal stones copy real architectural structures with a circular shape and sloping roof. In addition, the attachment of horns of consecration, along with the presence of the circular holes in the roof (between the tips of the horns) probably intended to receive plant stems, leads to the conclusion that the rustic shrines on seal stones are minimalist renditions of this type of circular shrine, with the horns and plant stems placed next to them as symbols of sanctity.19 The positioning of plant stems that appear to be growing from within the holy house and sprouting out of its roof would have given the model an enhanced association with fertility, as it would have linked in a visual and meaningful way the goddess housed in the shrine with the results of her fecund impact on nature. CONCLUSION There have been many different and opposing interpretations of the hut models.20 The most plausible of these seems to me to be the view that the circular hut comprises a kind of mechanism for the unveiling of the fixed or movable figure of the goddess, accomplished by opening the door.21 This way of revealing the figure goes back to rituals of enacted epiphany, perhaps with a priestess in the role of the goddess appearing to the faithful. Such an act could have been accomplished by opening curtains or multiple doorways (polythyra) in halls designed specifically for that function.22 This view is now reinforced by additional arguments, since our example shows that the hut model type existed from the beginning of the Neopalatial period when, based on related iconography, the perceptions of epiphany were formed and consolidated.23 It is also apparent that the models were intended from the beginning for religious use, as attested by the presence of horns of conse cration, the sacred symbol par excellence of Minoan religion.24 The Mount Gournos model, then, could depict a real structure that existed on the peak sanctuary where it was found. As we have already said, the dedications were concentrated and placed in crevices at the east side of 18. PMI, p. 674; PMII, pp. 39, 131-132. 19.

The flat top of the north outcrop from the west. Photo G. Rethemiotakis the rocky northern outcrop. This concentration of ritual activity does not appear to have had a specific architectural point of reference, since there were no permanent structures in the area. Rather, it is likely that the ritu als were focused and directed toward a centerpiece, a recipient of worship, namely an idol or a priestess in the role of the goddess, situated inside a makeshift hutlike construction that left no trace, placed on top of the flat peak west of the place of deposition (Figs. 16.3,16.17).25 Secured inside a crevice in the rock, where it had been devoutly placed to remain for eternity on top of the peak, the small clay model transfers to our time a picture of the real sanctuary, the shrine of the goddess, which once received the supplication and offering of the anonymous worshiper.26 25. A comparable topographic arrangement of places of deposition, with a level area above them, has also been attested in excavations of the peak sanctuaries of Kephala at Liliano and Stou Mamaloukou at Sklaverochori in the Pediada; Whitley 2003-2004. For similar natural configurations at the peak sanctuary at Atsipades Korakias, see Peatfield 1994, pp. 22-23. 26. The distinguished scholar hon ored here supports the view that the circular hut was the shelter of the god dess, hidden until the moment of the Apocalypse in order to keep its power intact (Gesell 1985, p. 66).</page></plain_text>
