<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS GISELA M. A. RICHTER, Archaic Greek Art Against Its Historical Background, New York, Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1949. Pp. 226; 337 figs.; 107 pls. $12.50. The contributions already rendered by Miss Richter to Greek and Roman archaeology are beyond number. As curator of the Departments of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan Museum, she has continually added works of art of the first order to the rich collec- tion in her care. As these have been acquired, they have afforded her the inspiration for original and thoughtful research. But also, in the course of her fruitful career, she has placed herself among those scholars-bold, perhaps even rash-who have not hesitated to brave the risks of generalization. In fact, she has more than once set forth valuable syntheses whose success has been world-wide and significant. We cannot forget the well-deserved acclaim which greeted her excellent study, The Sculpture and Sculp- tors of the Greeks. There were editions of this work in 1929 and 1930, and from these everyone the world over has profited greatly. Since that time, the en- thusiasm of our age for archaic art, whether sincere or merely a matter of fashion, has brought to museums everywhere offers of pre-classical works of art; Miss Richter, as a result, has frequently been drawn into the study of works of this type. We are indebted to her for that remarkable analysis in her Kouroi (1942); she has, moreover, made many contributions, through her monographs on Greek funerary monuments, to our knowledge of archaic Greek stelae, especially those of Attica (Archaic Attic Gravestones, 1944). If one had any doubt of the value of her work, of the fullness of the book under review, and of the author's extraor- dinary documentation of her material, one has only to glance at the recent volume covering, from one end to the other, the entire rich field of Greek art. This collection of lectures, presented at the Dumbarton Oaks Library and incorporating the Mary Flexner Lectures at Bryn Mawr in 1941,' bears eloquent wit- ness to the care which this eminent American specialist devotes to her scholarly labors in a vast field of classical studies. No one can fail to admire her or to be grateful to her. I believe I am correct in saying that it is to Greek archaic art that she most gladly turns her thoughts and for that predilection no one can in the least criticize her. Archaic art has the inestimable advantage that we can study it on the basis of the originals (and occasional forgeries). As Pindar puts it so magnificently (Olymp. 13, 17): "acrav 8"EpOv1ros Epyov" (Merit goes to him who conceived an idea for the first time). The Greek archaic age, a brilliantly creative period, enjoys eternal and well-deserved youth. The mono- graphs and books of Miss Richter have already shown that she has a thorough knowledge of all the pertinent evidence; this makes us all the more attentive to the subject of the Mary Flexner lectures, which she treats from a very personal and important point of view, as suggested by the title of the work under review: Archaic Greek Art Against Its Historical Background. In re- writing the history of Greek art from its beginnings, placing its development during two centuries against the background of ancient history, seeing the work of art so resolutely from the geographico-historical stand- point, the author has made a daring attempt to draw from ancient art its most human, its most eternal lessons. It means treating ancient art as a revelation, secret but true, of man in the past, and yet, in the same act, giving it its highest present-day value. I, for my part, heartily endorse this procedure, which eschews all aesthetic subjectivity, all the lengthy discussions of primitivism, and everything that may seem in any way tendentious, if not trifling-a daring procedure, I should say, especially in view of the positions taken by others, as in the valuable handbook recently started by Friedrich Matz, Geschichte der griechischen Kunst, 1950. In that work, stress is laid (with force and, one is tempted to add, with bias) on the concepts of "form" and "structure." G. Lippold (Deutsche Literatur- zeitung, Jahrb., xxvii, Heft Io, Oct. 1951, pp. 455- 459) was not the only German scholar, I am sure, to note and regret the deficient historical sense implicit in a point of view so rigidly systematized. After all, we are hardly beyond the stage of making inventories; the recent discovery of the archaic metopes of the sanctuary of Silaris shows, with reference to one small point, how vast, unfortunately, are the gaps in our present knowledge; this case may temper the feeling of pride arising from our satisfaction with the progress made in various fields-progress which is real enough, to be sure, in preparatory studies. Syntheses are neces- sary, but they have their risks. Miss Richter has worked hard to drive home this point. Thanks to her, we take part in an enthralling but cautious inquiry ever mindful of the boundaries of the ancient land, even when we cannot find our way on the maps, and of the psychology of a privileged race-a race whose progress was so rapid, so decisive, that mankind has long called it a miracle. The plan of the book is clear and instructive; the archaic period is divided into three short eras. Like Evans, Miss Richter has a penchant for divisions and subdivisions into threes: 650-575; 575-525; 525-480.2 The geographical treatment is most extensive. The author warns us in her preface that, because of the voyages of the artists and because of political conditions I. The work was revised and brought up to date after the war. 2. The subdivisions might be given the names of the princes and tyrants whom Herodotus has lovingly assembled in a rich array: first, the time of Cypselus, of Periander, and Solon; then, Croesus, Cyrus, Polycrates, and Pisistratus.</page><page sequence="2">66 THE ART BULLETIN in Greece, she will sometimes have to leave the Greek Mainland and to transport the reader to Asia Minor, to Persia, as well as to Egypt, and even occasionally to the West, toward Etruria and Spain. Miss Richter, as it were, uses a very wide-angle lens. We can emphati- cally say that in the case of Persian art, for example, her treatment has yielded some new and very attractive insights. I hesitate here to mention something that troubles me. Our own century, disorganized as it is, shows a lively taste for the neat classification of periods of art. Not long ago in Germany certain periods were divided mathematically into decades, and people thought they saw important, perhaps even complete changes exactly at each caesura. To be sure, there is nothing as exag- gerated as this in the periodization that has allowed us to arrange the monuments and the historical data in a general order. Miss Richter is wary of these risks. Still it would be imprudent to forget that even the best Anhaltspunkte may be changed, sometimes, if there is new evidence. As it happens, we already have a good example of such a situation in the history of the head of the so- called "Cnidian" Caryatid at Delphi, which Mr. Wolf- gang Darsow3 has just proposed to date in the period 520-510 instead of 546. Although I believe the new date to be much too late, the head, according to this dat- ing, is removed from a logical and chronological con- text in which we might have felt tempted, in full confi- dence, to regard it as a fixed point of comparison. The "Anhaltspunkt" is shaken. Time and again, we shall perhaps have to reset upon the loom-of course, each time more closely and more scientifically-the in- genious cross-threading which we try to apply like a graph to the development of Greek archaic art and which guides our decipherings of it, all of them pro- visional at best. Another problem: the author certainly has a right to start her study about the year 650; she is, after all, concerned with archaic art, and not with "geometric" art. Still, Greek art did not begin in 650 (though, to be sure, its pace quickened about that time), nor even with the counting of the Olympiads. Has the preceding age so little to offer in explanation of later art? Whether we regard it as marking or even creating the transitions, or as bringing out by contrast the patient, imaginative efforts by which the Greeks liberated them- selves from the restricting bonds of thought and art in which the Near East still held them enslaved, whatever the interpretation offered, it would have been preferable not to overlook this early period. In the general history by F. Matz, no fewer than forty-two pictures of archaic works of art are presented to the reader before he reaches the kouroi of Argos dedicated at Delphi; and I do not think we ought to overlook, among this number, the curious ivories from the Dipylon, so close in style to the stiff LetoYdes from the Delphinion of Dreros. In this period, we see the beginnings of a spirit of monumentality-a spirit proud, bold, altogether exceptional-and full of significance as well. To escape from the hieratic and despotic art of that early period, the Greeks found it necessary to exert the most stren- uous and persistent efforts. If it is true that Greece was the cradle of Western civilization, then it was between Iooo and 650 that she began to assume this role, and to earn this epithet. Miss Richter says, quite correctly, that Archaic Greece helps us to understand our own antecedents. Perhaps-but it is just as important for us to know its antecedents. There is some risk in begin- ning with the very period of the internecine strife between the entrenched aristocracy and the democratic masses, the time of crises when tyrants set themselves up as champions of popular causes, the unhappy time of conflicts and rival alliances, all alike dictated by self- interest. I am not unaware that there were hardly any large stone statues before 650 (Introduction, p. xxii, n. 2) and that this earlier period was dominated by the in- fluence of the pre-Greek religion, which was still partial to polysymbolism and thus secretly opposed to anthropomorphic statues, human or superhuman in size. Nevertheless, there is nothing to indicate that the first advances in rendering anatomy, and even the first steps toward the conception of a statue-I mean, the first success in representing appearances-were not achieved on wooden figures reduced in size by imitation of or reaction to oriental models-models which themselves are not likely to have been of great size, since they had to be moved from place to place. By 650, the Greeks were ready to grasp, if not yet to represent, the complex mechanisms of the human body. It would have been interesting, then, to be able to follow and to observe, as closely as possible, their early apprenticeship.4 Whatever one may think of my views, which do not conceal regrets, the historical approach chosen by the author has its appeal. Miss Richter is quite right in thinking that the evolution of Greek archaic art is more surely known today, thanks to advances in the technique of excavation, and to the meticulous re- search with which the author herself and others have studied the korai and the kouroi as well as the black- figured vases, Attic and Proto-Attic, Corinthian and Proto-Corinthian. There are also the invaluable studies by many scholars of the signatures of artists, and of the dedications of early votive offerings. As a result, we can follow the various stages of Greek art much better than we could at the beginning of the century. Discoveries have now taken on form and substance; we can relate the known works of art to historical events, for we now have monuments definitely ascribed to precise centers 3. Mitt. d. Athen. Inst., 1950, pp. 119-134. 4. After 570, it is true, the wooden images of Pharaoh Amasis dedicated in Samos at the Heraion by the Prince him- self, the Egyptian works still extant in the great temple at the time of Herodotus (11, 782), give us evidence of the continuity of such exchange of artistic influences. Amasis had had a true portrait of himself painted at Cyrene. All of this, started quite early no doubt, is valuable still later, for example, as a source for the role of Cyrene in the history of the development of princely portraits (cf. the Arcesilaus Iv, c. 440).</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 67 of art and determined periods. Not that all dispute has been silenced, even here. The problem involved in the career of Antenor and the question of the date of the Athenian Treasury at Delphi is enough to demonstrate this. But how much progress we have made in the case of the Attic kouroi of Sounion, the case of the vases of the Nessos-Painter, and that of Sophilos! Our knowledge of the whole pre-Solonic period of Athens has been enriched by these studies, for we see emerging from that period the creative energy and the artistic interest of the aristocratic Athenian. We have had analogous discoveries at Delos where the Naxian period, for example, is defined for all time so clearly in the local sculpture; and at Cyrene, where we see the Theraean influence losing its monop- oly after the Nomothete Demonax of Mantinea had enlarged and settled the boundaries of the colony of the Battiades. Have not the German excavations at Samos brought to light, in addition, the importance of the Samian Heraion, and of Samos itself, long before the tyrant Polycrates came to power? One might easily multiply the examples. The author has made no mistake in speaking of the essential interest of her project and her work-in judging that her essay arouses "the thrill of discovery" (Introduction, p. xxi). Citing the witty comments of Gilbert Murray, she has guarded in advance against possible criticism, by trying to justify the position of prominence-certainly an enviable posi- tion, and one that therefore will not fail to arouse jealousy and even attack-that she gives to archaic sculpture-more truly representative, she says, than history itself! May I point out, nevertheless, that it is usually the historical events which are likely to establish a point of chronological reference for the sculpture; the opposite is far more rare. Miss Richter herself admits that for the first stages the classifications she has attempted depend largely upon the dates of the founding of certain Greek colonies (cf., p. 13, p. 55); and, we may add, upon the dates of certain dynasties (cf. the recent discussions of the chronology of the Cypselids and of the periods of the great expansion of Corinthian ceramics-ceramics on which depend the dating both of the terra-cotta heads and the oldest stone images.5 Of course, all this may very well be disputed at any moment by new discoveries; there are so many ancient sites yet unexplored! But for the present, the few beacons of archaeology and the com- panion beacons of history must be depended upon, though they remain conjectural. Naturally there are exceptions to these uncertainties. On the Acropolis at Athens, which the Persians destroyed in 480 and 479, the Perserschutt furnishes an absolute point of reference, as does the "cemetary" of the korai; from the time of the ritual burying of these defiled young companions of Athena, we date a new era of politics and of the arts. That date is an effective terminus: Athens, freed at Salamis from fear of the Persians, began at this point her career as a great maritime power-but not without arousing the jealousy and enmity of Sparta. We must note here-while expressing certain reser- vations-where the method of this work leads us. Miss Richter has tried to make a clear and complete break with the "intuitive" approach established long ago in the important study of A. Furtwaingler and brought back into fashion, with certain changes, in 1927, by the Friihgriechische Bildhauerschulen of E. Langlotz. I was not slow in warning of the dangers of this tendency even when it first appeared, let alone when it reap- peared in a new guise (Gaz. Beaux-Arts, 71, 1929, pp. 285-316: "A travers les 6coles archaYques de la sculpture grecque"). But at the same time I noted the soundness of the inquiries and analyses of Langlotz, and the solidity of certain of his classifications, based on research that was both thorough and subtle. There was more to be retained here, it seemed to me, than to be rejected. Archaic Greek Art now calls all these earlier studies into question. Apparently we must now break with all our earlier illusions, we must from this moment give up our effort to distinguish (let alone to define) the various local schools, whose character the Germans have labored so hard to differentiate, even though sometimes too subtly, or even arbitrarily. I admit that I find it difficult to resign myself to this course. Is it really necessary, in the general study of sculpture, to reject methods which have so often been applied with such success in the study of vase painting-more than once by Miss Richter herself? Why should there be so much difference between these two fields? Greece, as the author herself reminds us, did not present herself as an integrated whole even in the face of the enemy of her liberties; one sees plenty of evidence of this at the time of the Persian War. The Greek city-states, in their jealousy, constantly showed their uneasy independence of spirit. We are reminded-and most appropriately- of the pessimistic words of Herodotus (I, 5; cf. here p. xxiv, n. 6) who pointed out, long before anyone else, the "mortal" quality of civilizations and the vicissitudes of states with regard to their collective prosperity. But since rrivra p ; holds good both in time and space, why should we not be willing, in the case of art, to take its truth into account when occasion demands? Artistic creation is an individual matter, perhaps even a matter of mystery as Plato believed; in any case, it is almost always unpredictable. It is quite possible that the Greek sculptors traveled from a very early date in the Near East-I for one have often noted that possibility-al- though we are now doubtful, for instance, about the voyage of Canachos to Miletos, and especially about his having made the beautiful Louvre torso. I cannot see that the relative "ubiquity" of the great favorites or even the lesser favorites of fame and of patronage can possibly interfere with our belief in the existence of stable and differentiated local schools of sculpture. At Delos, in the series of kouroi, do we not see the 5. Are we right here in relying on the authority of Thucyd- ides (6, 9, 2) who gave the date 630-623 for the foundation of Selinus (Dunbabin, Western Greeks, p. 436)? For Cyrene, it is the end of the dynasty of the Battiades, ca. 440, which helps to date the bronze head of Arcesilaus IV found in the Apol- lonion, etc.</page><page sequence="4">68 THE ART BULLETIN Naxian works (Nicandro), the Chian-Parian (the Potnia of Archermus), even the Delian (unfinished kouroi on the island), standing together and yet clearly distinguished from one another? There has been talk of "arbitrary virtuosity"6 in the attempt to distinguish between the schools of Cleonae and Sicyon; why should not the art of Argos, too, be dissolved in the common "melting pot"? After all, even in the time of Polyclitus, we see a gifted artist, already successful, change his technique because he had profited from les- sons in the aesthetics of Athens (Diadumenos). Yet it is rash to discard in one lump, as belonging to the wasted efforts of humanity, fifty years of concentrated modern research-research certainly fruitful, inten- sive, at times even enthralling, as the author herself says. Are we so anxious to give up the sense we have developed of nice distinctions-a sense which, in my opinion and that of others, would not seem likely to fade out as our studies progress? 7 I should be very sorry if that happened, for I believe the sacrifice asked of us is to no purpose. We can rejoice in the definite prog- ress that has been made in the historico-geographical classifications of works of sculpture without feeling obliged to give up, in connection with works that are never found in series, the theory that recognizes the fluctuating aspects of local genius, which everywhere in Greece is so strongly attached to the soil. And what about this: would the Milesians and the Samians al- ways have created exactly the same figures, or the Thasians and the Parians (companions, these latter, of Telesicles in his emigration!); and the Arcadians and the Messenians and the Spartans as well, and the peo- ple of Selinus, Tarentum or of Paestum? What little we know of their works does not force us to give up thinking of these peoples as distinct entities through suc- cessive ages, their creative genius everywhere conveying the ethnic, intellectual, and physical traits of each. Let me repeat, apologizing for such insistence, that I do indeed understand and fully approve what Miss Richter has undertaken to do: to trace, as it were, the essential lines of force in her field. For this is what she achieves when she emphasizes the larger tendencies: first, that of the vigorous sculptors of Peloponnesus, who concerned themselves with the problem of stabilizing structure and form-what F. Matz called the "hacking out" of the anatomy; then, again, the tendencies of the Ionian East, which was more interested in the pictur- esque and in the play of surfaces, and which created its artistic conceptions and worked them out more gently, somewhat in the manner of painting. As between these two trends, Attic art pursued the highest refinement of logic as well as of design-an ideal of formal elegance, more delicate and more intellectualized. We may admit, without serious fear of having missed some- thing, that any other aesthetic approach is irrelevant, and that, as the author says with perhaps too much resignation: "The common progression to naturalism is more apparent than individual local characteristics."' Besides, Miss Richter, in spite of her doubts, does be- lieve in homogeneous groups: e.g. the kouroi of Sounion, Dipylon, etc., which may be attributed, she says, to a single workshop (p. 8). Does there not exist, then, at least this one school which is not hypo- thetical? 9 If the author had really so completely given up the idea of pursuing the chimaera of archaic "schools," she would never have included in her work, to our delight-rare jewels!-so many exotic bits, Etruscan or even Persian, so many works from countries of the non-Greek world. We can at once concede-although this will not, most likely, be a unanimous opinionl0- that these sculptures do bear the Greek imprint. The different branches, grafted here and there, have grown firmly to the parent tree. But may we not speak here and there precisely of "schools"? From East and West, these productions-whether of the free world or of subject lands, whether of colonists or of exiles, from Persepolis to Veii-are no imitations but genuine crea- tions. The tribute-bearers portrayed in long ranks on the great stairways of Persepolis do not climb the steps as the winged victories of the Athena-Nike parapet would have done, or as the korai might have done who could have gone before them along the paths of slavery. There is something unique in the Ionic smile of the Veii Apollo. If this new contribution is a fruitful en- richment of our understanding of ancient Greek art beyond the frontiers of Greece," if the contrasts and comparisons made here serve to close gaps in our in- formation, what danger would there have been in dif- ferentiating also the many valuable facets of Greek art proper?* CHARLES PICARD Universit. de Paris 6. R.E.G., 64, 1951, p. 335. 7. We observe that the author herself has a good sense of the relationship of dates (cf. for example, p. xxv, n. 8). What we must be wary of in advance is the dogmatism of her future disciples! 8. I do not share the skepticism noted in Kouroi (for example pp. Ioff.), because of my experience especially with the Delian and Thasian statues. 9. How unconvincing is the statement that we do not know whether the objects found on a site were actually the work of an artist of that locality! Of course! But we have to investi- gate. Who does not know of what exotic mixtures "the school of Paris" is made up today? Of course, we always find, side by side, along with aestheticism, both academicism and fauvism, for example. So. Miss Richter's conclusions on the participation of the Ionians in the decoration at Persepolis, or in Persian art generally, have already been disputed by Mrs. Vollgraff (Anne Roes) and by Henri Seyrig (Milanges Herzfeld). The fact is that in the records of the construction of Persepolis, Ionian workmen came into the picture as builders rather than in any other role. Moreover, even if there had been Ionian participa- tion in the Persian monumental sculptures, they remain surely the evidence of Asiatic aesthetics. 1 i. There are, of course, additions and corrections of detail to be suggested here and there. I shall point some out in the Revue Archiologique. * Author and editor are indebted to Mrs. Max Trell, New York, for her translation of this review.</page></plain_text>
