<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Reach of the Aesthetic: Collected Essays on Art and Nature By Ronald W. Hepburn Ashgate Publishing, 2001, pp. xv + 170. '[A] sharp either/or seems unjustified here' (p. 65). Ronald Hepburn makes this remark in the context of discussing two diametrically opposed views on the (ir)relevance of 'life-enhancing effects' to aesthetic apprecia- tion. But it could serve as a slogan for the whole of his book-a collection of ten sensitive and crafted essays, three of them previously unpublished, composed over the last decade. Such a slogan would accurately announce that Hepburn's turn of thought is Hegelian, not Kierkegaardian, in char- acter. Truth or wisdom rests, typically, not in the 'either' or the 'or', but in a position that mediates between the disjuncts, recognizing their respective insights and excesses. This is the case, especially, with the competing and extreme claims made about the relationship between the aesthetic and other domains that, as its opening paragraph explains, it is a primary aim of the book to explore. 'The tracing out of the ... interconnections and interplay of aesthetic with other domains is followed by attempts to locate the limits of such connections' (p. vii). Essays 2-3, for example, while sym- 293</page><page sequence="2">New Books pathetic to aspects of an 'aesthetic theory of virtue', emphasize the limits which such a theory runs up against, in the form of duties from which no amount of aesthetic distaste for performing them can release us. Hepburn's 'trimming' approach is not confined to conflicts over the relation of the aesthetic to other dimensions, moral and religious, especial- ly. In connection with a wide variety of issues, the strategy is to explain the temptations-part real, part illusory-of polarised positions and to seek a satisfactory resolution somewhere in between. 'Life-enhancement' cannot be the 'sole key concept in a theory of art', as Bernard Berenson seemed to hold, but nor, as 'formalists' have held, is it irrelevant to aesthetic appreci- ation. A religious sense of the sacred is not to be identified with theistic belief, but nor can it, while retaining its force, entirely lose-as Heideggerians, Gaia-ists and New Agers imagine-its 'strong nisus back towards its original [theistic] context' (p. 127). Again, while it is 'anthro- pomorphism' to 'annex' nature and treat it as being there for us to deci- pher its moral or religious 'messages', the sort of 'respect' for nature's 'independence' accorded it by natural scientists pre-empts the genuine ways in which reflection on nature may enliven and inspire our self-under- standing. In these and other cases, Hepburn is keen to record the insights of the nevertheless exaggerated positions between which he steers. In many instances, the insights reflect the profoundly ambiguous character of our experience of art and nature, the 'paradoxical co-presence' (pp. 1 34-5) of, for example, both sensuous and transcendent, or temporal and time- transcending, qualities of a piece of music or of a hillside emerging from the mist. Justice is only done to the phenomenology of aesthetic experi- ence when such polarities are accommodated. It should be clear, from this rehearsal of the issues and themes treated by Hepburn, for whom this collection of essays is not written. It is not for those students of aesthetics taxed by distinctions between depiction, description, denotation and designation, or by the criteria for judging which of some indistinguishable baked bean tins are artworks. Nor is the book for those artists, art critics and aficionados who get theirfrisson from unmade beds, hours-long videos of motionless faces, or randomised elec- tronic noises. Hepburn's 'sources' in philosophy are Coleridge and Schiller, rather than Goodman and Danto, and in art Schubert and Wordsworth, rather than Tracey Emin and John Cage. He would not, I think, resent the label 'old fashioned' being applied both to his philosoph- ical concerns and his taste. Certainly the three problematical relationships to which Hepburn devotes most pages were staple concerns of Romantic artists, poets and thinkers. These are the relations between aesthetic and religious experience, art and nature, and between all of these art, the aesthetic, nature and religion. Given what is surely a very 'modern' preoccupation with the environ- ment, it may sound odd to describe as 'old-fashioned' a concern with the relationship between art and nature. In fact, however, most contemporary writings in 'environmental aesthetics' do not so much address conceptual connections as issues about the enhancement, or otherwise, of nature by 294</page><page sequence="3">New Books human intervention (environmental landscaping, 'eco-architecture' and the like). Moreover, many environmentalists, especially deep green ones, are hostile to considering nature in aesthetic terms, seeing in this an undu- ly 'anthropocentric', even 'instrumental', attitude towards nature. It is one of Hepburn's major achievements in recent years to have rehabilitated an older style of reflection on the aesthetics of nature, and in a form that should convince both deep green critics and environmental planners of the respectability and seriousness of 'attach[ing] high importance to the aes- thetic appreciation of nature in a fulfilled human life' (p. viii). He is, unsurprisingly, critical of the divorce made by Hegel and Adorno between art appreciation and receptivity to the natural world. That both artworks and natural objects can be beautiful and yield similar pleasures should not be in contention. What the Hegelians illegitimately downplay, however, is the degree to which in 'serious' aesthetic enjoyment of nature-as of art- there is a 'fusion' of 'perception-and-reflection', of 'sensuous content' with 'thought content'. In particular, thoughtful reflection on nature may 'furnish symbols for our inwardness' (p. 7), provide materials that facilitate the articulation of self-understanding. To be sure, there is a danger here of sentimental anthropomorphism, of the 'pathetic fallacy'. But it is a stunt- ed and limited person for whom the falling autumn leaf is simply a 'red- dish-brown material object'-or worse, a colourless bearer of 'primary qualities' alone. Certainly there is no excuse for self-inflicted blindness to the 'symbols' or 'messages' that nature provides on the ground that these are discernible only from a human 'perspective', from the viewpoint of subjectivity. The 'objective' stance is no less a human one and should be accorded no greater authority than other perspectives on our world. For many Romantics, nature and art furnished symbols not only of our inwardness, but of something beyond ourselves, something 'higher'. Snowden in the mist, Hepburn reminds us, was for Wordsworth 'a perfect image of a mighty Mind, / Of one that feeds upon infinity' (p. 149). It is such intimations that have inspired one of Hepburn's 'longest-lasting con- cerns', to 'elucidate the way in which aesthetic experience approaches experience delineated in theistic language'. In this complex area, he con- cedes, he remains 'poised between credulity and scepticism' (pp. 103-4). I have already noted his combination of sympathy towards the invocation of religious language in certain aesthetic experiences and concern that the more 'portentous' terms belonging to that language-notably 'sacred' and 'holy'-are rooted in theistic 'background beliefs' not subscribed to by those having these experiences. A similar combination informs Hepburn's judgment on the use of 'cosmic imagination'-of, that is, 'appropriating ... processes or patterns perceived in nature-at-large' (p. 148) for guiding our lives, including our artistic activity. A main problem here is that so many patterns may be perceived in nature. Why focus, like Don Cupitt, on the solar process-burning, pouring out, passing away-as the model for human life rather than, like Lao Tzu, on the gentler, less dramatic behav- iour of water? One remains, finally, poised between credulity and scepticism towards views, like George Steiner's, concerning the 'cognitive 295</page><page sequence="4">New Books ability' of artworks and natural objects to 'disclose' religious truths. It can- not be 'inappropriate' to explore their religious import, but they surely provide no 'warrant to extrapolate to theistic belief' (p. 103). The critical reader may wonder, here, if Hepburn sufficiently distinguishes between phenomenology and ontology. When Steiner says of a Schubert movement that it 'conveys both ... the finality of death and a certain refusal of that very finality' (Real Presences, p. 226), he is not, I think, claiming that the music has the 'cognitive ability' to disclose a truth via, say, an 'inference to the best explanation' of the musical experience. That would not gainsay the claim that a description of what the music conveys-of what, in Husserl's sense, it 'intends'-must speak of immortality. That leaves it open whether what is 'intended' is also actual-whether, in other words, there is the immortality that the music conveys. Hepburn, I suspect, would be gratified less by his readers' agreement with his own measured and 'trimming' judgements than by their revisiting of paintings, pieces of music, rivers and country paths with a refreshed, heightened, vital and imaginative sensitivity to the rich, and typically ambiguous, meanings which these have both for ourselves and the wider order to which we-again ambiguously-belong. Ronald Hepburn, one feels sure, is just the person one would want as a guide, whether through the rooms of a great city art gallery or the forests and hills that surround the city. David E.
