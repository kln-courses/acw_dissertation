<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK WILLIAM S. HECKSCHER Die allegorisierende Richtung des Zeitalters brachte es fertig, selbst die elegante Komposition des Elefanten, der einen kleinen Obelisken trigt . . . in moralisierendem Sinne zu interpretieren (see note 13). THE last work that Bernini and his assistants under- took for Pope Alexander VII is the monument erected in 1667 on the Piazza della Minerva in Rome (Fig. I). It displays a small Egyptian obelisk that Bernini placed upon the back of an almost life-size marble elephant, who in turn stands on a high and narrow pedes- tal. The obelisk is crowned by the insignia of the Pope (Chigi mountains and Chigi star) with the Cross of Christ on top. Two plaques on the plinth bear dedicatory in- scriptions. The monument occupies the approximate cen- ter of the Piazza, opposite the main entrance of the west fagade of S. Maria sopra Minerva, with the axis of the elephant's body facing south. How are we to interpret this startling combination of baroque elephant and pagan stone in front of a church? We have learned, when examining works of "baroque style," to look for an inclination on the part of the artist to con- jure up antitheses, to bring together and then try to pacify seemingly incompatible contrasts. In our case we need not look far to find such bold com- binations as that of modern and old, of marble statue and granite monolith, of living creature and dead stone. In symbolic terms we may add the contrast of pagan stone and Cross of Christ, of dignified Pope and slightly comical beast - for the elephant perhaps offers an allegorical por- trait of Alexander VII. Yet after expressing our admira- tion of the ease with which the final synthesis has been achieved, not all has been said. For should we assume only that Bernini designed this monument for the amusement of a Pope, as an ephemeral trifle made permanent by its material substance alone? The purely stylistic analysis that would urge us to see in the elephant with his obelisk a piece of rather quixotic baroque humor, is flatly contradicted by the "documents Note. The present study grew out of papers read before the last annual meeting of the College Art Association in New York and the Journal Club at Princeton. Thanks are due to many colleagues and friends for help and advice generously rendered - to none more than Erwin Panofsky. of the case." From these I believe the quintessence of the meaning that Bernini and his contemporaries would have wished us to read into the monument can be reconstructed. Before embarking on our analysis of the elements, which singly and in unison reveal the program, it will be use- ful to recall some of the known pertinent facts concerning the events and plans that preceded the final execution of the Minerva monument. In the first place, the invenzione of placing an obelisk upon the back of an elephant was by no means Bernini's own. Gnoli and others have pointed out that it was sug- gested by the handsome woodcut in Francesco Colonna's much admired Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1499) (Fig. 2). But, important as the Colonna print may be for our monument, its influence does not go beyond the generali- ties of outward configuration. The limitations of Colonna's elephant are obvious: the obelisk pierces its body and thereby deprives us of the possible illusion that it might be a living beast that carries the mighty load. And no sooner has Colonna-Poliphilo informed us that on his elephant's forehead the words ZEAL AND INDUSTRY are af- fixed, than he descends by the little staircase into the ele- phant's viscera, leaving his puzzled readers behind. Bernini's earliest study of an elephant, a little master- piece in itself, shows the lower portion of an obelisk rest- ing on the elephant's ornate saddle (Fig. 3).1 Bernini, we may safely assume, had in 1630 seen and studied the first elephant to visit Rome in more than a hundred years. Study of the real beast surely convinced Bernini of its emi- nently plastic and tectonic qualities - such as Colonna's representation had postulated but not proven.2 The syn- thesis between nature-study and antiquarian revival appears in a drawing at Windsor Castle.

The motif of the elephant as a caryatid, as we shall see, ultimately goes back to Hindu art. In Indian mythology the elephant is thought of as carrying the weight of the world; when he falters, the earth quakes: Wann der Koloss-Elephant, zur Erleichterung, miide der Last nun Schiittelt das Haupt, dann wird Erdbeben gespiirt von den Menschen; Ramayana, I, 11. 15 ff., ed. and tr.

Both represent prepara- tory stages to a monument, obviously commissioned by Urban VIII, that for reasons unknown to us was never executed. In order to appreciate the meaning of the Mi- nerva monument more fully, it will be useful to dwell a little longer on this first project. Brauer-Wittkower have pointed out that it was in- tended for the park-like setting of the Barberini Gardens in Rome, where the elephant with his burden (resting on a shallow plinth) would have been well concealed from the curious glances of outsiders. An "ideal view" of the Barberini Gardens, an etching of 1699, suggests the obelisk in situ, set almost waist-deep behind the garden-wall and surrounded by trees (Fig. 4). What could be more "ba- roque" than that the unprepared beholder, entering the grounds, or looking out of one of the windows of the palace, should suddenly find himself confronted by the likeness of an elephant, placidly balancing an Egyptian obelisk on his back, ready to advance at any moment!' In reality, however, the obelisk rotted, lying in the Barberini Gardens where John Evelyn saw it, until after further vagaries it was finally erected on the Pincio in 1821.I Quite unexpectedly, and after the lapse of more than thirty years, Bernini's old plan was revived in 1665. The Dominicans of S. Maria sopra Minerva, as they were dig- ging the foundations of a wall, uncovered an obelisk which, measuring in height less than five and a half meters, was among the smallest the soil of the city of Rome had yielded.' It had belonged to the Isaeum of Minerva Chal- cidica, a site known to harbor Egyptian antiquities.' The archaeological strata would suggest not only "Maria sopra Minerva," but also "Minerva sopra Iside," an association which could not pass unnoticed at a time when the minds were so well attuned to the inherent harmony between pagan prefigurations and their Christian fulfillment. The three "goddesses" would at once appear as representatives within their respective cults of one and the same concept of Divine Wisdom. This very concept would exert, as we shall see, the greatest influence on the program for Ber- nini's monument. Alexander VII, on receiving the news of this find, com- missioned Bernini, who had just returned from his journey to France, to design a worthy setting for the Minerva obelisk. The Pope also turned to Athanasius Kircher, his trusted adviser in matters hieroglyphic, for an interpreta- tion of the obelisk. Kircher, one of the great scholarly Jesuits, whom his contemporaries celebrated as "Horus Teuto," rapidly composed his Interpretatio hieroglyphica.' This book contains an explanation of the metaphysical aspects of the Minerva obelisk and its hieroglyphs, and an introductory part in which a number of poets celebrated in very elucidating terms not only the Pope (and Kircher) but also the monument itself, even before it had been erected in the Piazza Minerva. A problem that has as yet to be disentangled concerns the part the Dominicans played in the programmatic plan- ning of the monument. The obelisk was unearthed on their grounds and they must have advanced the claim of their Order: Some of the designs for the obelisk, preserved in workshop copies in the Chigiana volume of Bernini's draw- ings, show the Dominican dogs, the domini canes, as car- riers of the obelisk.8 In the end the dogs were driven out by the elephant and, qua emblem, were made to yield to the personal insignia of Fabio Chigi. We may now turn to Bernini's original drawings for the new project. Two of three that can safely be attributed to his hand show the elephant theme once more. If we discount the considerable stylistic advance in draftsman- 3. Cf. H. Brauer and R. Wittkower, Die Zeicknungen des Gian- lorenzo Bernini, Rdmische Forschungen der Bibliotheca Hertziana, ix, Berlin, 1931, II, pl. I4. All the Bernini originals will be found in these two volumes as well as much of the relevant source mate- rial for the Minerva monument. This publication will be quoted henceforth as Brauer-Wittkower. 4. The obelisk had once been put up in honor of Antinous. Cf. Brauer-Wittkower, I, p. 145, note 5. It was moved from its original site (Porta Maggiore) to the Palazzo Barberini in 1632; this event, in conjunction with the elephant's visit to Rome in 1630, makes it safe to say that bozetto and Windsor drawing originated "in the early 'thirties"; cf. Brauer-Wittkower, I, pp. 145 ff. where the Barberini project is discussed in detail; for A. Specchi's etching of the view of the Barberini palace and garden, cf. II novo teatro delle fabriche . . ., Rome, 1699, Iv, fol. 17 (and also zo); it should, however, be noted that this "ideal reconstruction" of a monument that was never executed by no means purported to follow Bernini's particular project. 5. John Evelyn, Diary, sub 7 Nov. 1644, found the obelisk to be in a very poor condition. His report, like almost everything in Evelyn's notice on Rome, is derivative. I owe this information to Esmond S. de Beer, who is preparing a new edition of the Diary. 6. Cf. Athanasius Kircher, Ad Alexandrum, VII. Pont. Max. obelisci Aegyptiaci nuper inter Isaei Romani rudera effosi inter- pretatio hieroglyphica, Rome, 1666, introduction (no pagination). This title will henceforth be quoted as Interpretatio. The full page etching at the beginning of the book is a faithful copy of Bernini's Windsor drawing of the early 'thirties in which Fabio Chigi's in- signia replace those of Pope Urban. The pedestal resembles the monument as executed. 7. This region, as everyone knew, had yielded, apart from an- other obelisk, the colossal group of Father Nile, as well as a va- riety of statues of animals - baboon, lion, as well as sphinxes - which are now in the Vatican Museum; cf. S. B. Platner and Ashby, A Topographical Dictionary of Rome, London, 1929, chap. "Obelisci Isei Campensis." 8. J.-J. Berthier in L'tglise de la Minerve a' Rome, Rome, 1910o, pp. 21 ff., made a strong and unconvincing plea for Dominican in- fluence; cf. note i ; granted, as it stands, the monument was in- spired by the book of a Dominican: the Hypnerotomachia. 9. The third original, a Hercules balancing the obelisk as an</page><page sequence="3">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK 157 ship, we might, at first, be tempted to say that they offer little more than replicas of the Barberini designs of the 'thirties. Yet closer scrutiny shows that in his two Chigi designs and in the final execution Bernini had, step by step, turned away from the playfully humorous conceit with which he originally intended to dramatize the ele- phant. Instead he now aimed at a rendering that was at once monumental and abstract. Brauer and Wittkower, in their very fine analysis of this set of drawings, have pointed out that the first of the drawings still showed the elephant "free standing," that is potentially mobile, but that the second (nearly identical with the final execution that Bernini left to Ercole Ferrata) has a heavy piece of drapery hung over the elephant's back. The tassels touch the ground on either side without tectonic function (Fig. 5).1? I cannot agree with the conclusion that Bernini thereby intended to return to Francesco Colonna's wood- cut which, as we have seen, showed the elephant impaled by its obelisk. It is significant that by this device alone the animal, which originally appeared as if at liberty to move, had now been petrified as it were. Moreover in the finished monument the beast is perched rather precariously on its high and narrow plinth." But the most obvious change is that the new setting on the bare Piazza in front of S. Maria sopra Minerva, effective though it was from a point of view of "stage-setting," re- jected the possibility of a "chance discovery" of the ele- phant with his obelisk, and banished the "intimacy" that had been one of the prime characteristics of the Barberini plan (Fig. 6).12 The reasons for this fundamental change transcend the mere exigencies of altered external circumstances. For them alone Bernini was not ready to sacrifice such emi- nently baroque qualities as tension, surprise, and subse- quent solution. Bernini's original project underwent mean- ingful modifications and was enriched by the addition of new motifs: within the terms of the Chigi program, elephant and obelisk, singly as well as combined, seen in the light of the inscriptions of the dedicatory tablets on the face of the plinth, and also the entire monument in its peculiar juxtaposition to the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva, were meant to be understood as an impresa in honor of Alexander VII."1 The approval of the final drafts must have come from the Pope himself; however the fact, significant in itself, that Alexander VII had been keenly interested in the Hypnerotomachia" has proved to be just as secondary to the ultimate choice of the elephant for the obelisk's carrier, as the fact that, after the middle of the century, an elephant - this time pregnant and slightly clownish - had again made an appearance in the streets of Rome.15 For neither obvious feat of strength, will be discussed in section III. Those sketches not by Bernini himself, and therefore not included in Brauer-Wittkower, are conveniently reproduced in D.

Shortly before Alexander VII died (22 May I667) the monument was brought into position in the Piazza della Minerva. Cervini's Diario reports sub 3 Feb. 1667: "Alzata la Giuglia nella piazza della Minerva . . ."; in agreement with this date: St. Fraschetti, II Bernini, Milan, 1900, p. 306, note 3 and also L. Pas- tor, Geschichte der Pdpste, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1929, XIV, part I, p. 504, note 2. J.-J. Berthier, op. cit., p. 21, stresses that not Ber- nini but the Dominican, Fra Domenico (also mentioned as Giuseppe or Luigi) Paglia, was in charge of the installation. To be sure Paglia, who was an architect, may well have been responsible for the technicalities of the actual unveiling; MS Barb. lat. 6369 of the Vatican Library reads, sub ii June 1667 (i.e., after Alexander VII had died but before his successor, Clement IX, had been elected) as follows: "Si e scoperto l'elefante che sostiene l'accen- nata guglia su la Piazza della Minerva di squisita scultura, con I'Inscrittione et Armi del Defonto Pontefice sotto la direttione del Padre Gioseppe Domenica Architetto famosissimo"; cf. Roma: Rivista di studi e di vita romana, viI, 1929, p. 372. For a discus- sion of the plinth, cf. Brauer-Wittkower, I, pp. 144 and 147. 12. The earliest view of the Minerva monument in situ is found in the two fine etchings of the Piazza by Giov. B. Falda, published by Gio. Jacomo Rossi, Il secondo libro del' novo teatro .., Rome, n.d., fols. 6 (in profile) and 7 (en face); a terminus ante of this publication is afforded by the undated third book, which bears a dedicatory title to Clement IX (elected 20 June 1667). A terminus post is given by the explicit date of the first book, 1665. The Piazza has remained substantially unaltered since Bernini's day. 13. This fact has been acknowledged although in an entirely negative sense: for the motto of this article cf. Walther Weibel, Jesuitismus und Barockskulptur in Rom, Strassburg, 1909, p. 61. i4. Fabio Chigi owned the 1499 edition of the Hypneroto- ,machia in a copy which is still among the books of the Chigiana in Rome (Bibl. Vatic. Stampi Chig., II, 6io), and which is every- where described as "heavily annotated." The present writer is obliged to Dr. C. R. Morey and Prof. Pio Pecchiai of the Vatican Library for help in obtaining photostats of the relevant folios. The notes in the Pope's own hand are a careful marginal index of topics. The elephant evoked no keener interest than any other hieroglyph. To the crucial motto (fol. b vii recto) - I'ONOE KAI EYPIYIA --Chigi has added: "questa figura era nella fronte dell' elefante." Personal observations are rare; in one in- stance an amusing sidelight on the Pope's own character may be found in the marginal correction he adds to a passage in which Colonna enumerates "parti che dove hauere un buon architetto," and where the Pope has changed the words "sia buono loquace" into "non loquace"; possibly Fabio Chigi identified himself with the "buon architetto," for his guiding maxim was "Molto fare e poco dire" (cf. Pastor, op. cit., xiv, pt. i, p. 313), since he could not well have had Bernini in mind! The fact, however, that classi- cal antiquity even at this stage of advancing archaeological insight should still be sought and found in Colonna's antiquarian dream of the Quattrocento is remarkable in itself. Straight copies after the woodcuts in the Poliphilo were not uncommon in seventeenth- century sketchbooks of antiques; hand "B" in the so-called "Tac- cuino di Baldasare Peruzzi" in Siena has numerous drawings after the woodcuts. Among them is the elephant with his obelisk (fol. 1i verso); cf. H. Egger, "Entwiirfe Baldassare Peruzzis . . .," Jahrbuch der kunsthistorischen Sammlungen des allerh6chsten Kaiserhauses, XXIII, 1902, p. 24. 15. "Fu condotto in questi giorni a Roma un Elefante femmina,</page><page sequence="4">158 THE ART BULLETIN fact would help to account for the monumentality of the Minerva statue as opposed to the intimacy of the Bar- berini project, or for the dignity of the Minerva elephant himself, achieved at the expense of the anthropomorphically humorous appeal of his predecessor in the early 'thirties. To arrive at a clearer understanding of the Minerva monument as a cultural document of its day, it will be best to discuss it in the light of three basic themes: first, the elephant as carrier of the obelisk, and as legitimate heir to the time-honored theme of "elephant and castle"; sec- ond, the elephant as a moral allegory, in the wake of the broad and powerful stream of tradition of antique and mediaeval animal lore; third, the obelisk as a pagan stone cleansed and re-erected by a Pope as the expression of his desire to see man's eternal hope for a share in the gifts of Divine Wisdom glorified through himself. THE ELEPHANT AS CARYATID The first private owner of an elephant north of the Alps, a certain Mijnheer Sevender, in 1627 commissioned a Frenchman from Rouen, David Ferrand by name, to satisfy his "laudable curiosity" regarding the "nature and excellence of the said animal." David Ferrand obliged with a charming little treatise entitled Discours apolo- ge'tique en faveur de l'instinct et naturel admirable de l'dlefant. Here we meet with the following observation: ". .. it is also not without good reason that our sculptors and our painters depict them with towers and citadels on their shoulders, showing by this hieroglyph, how their robustness is great and almost beyond belief.""1 The ele- phant with his castle was popular enough to grace one of the better inns in Elizabethan London as we all know through its advertisement in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Not so long ago it was discovered that the bowl-shaped "castle" on the back of a Buddhistic rock-crystal elephant of the third century B.c. had been added in the sixteenth century; perhaps the Renaissance artist felt a horror vacui when he beheld the elephant's bare back." "Turrigerus" in Renaissance literature is the commonest epithet of the elephant. Even Bernini's elephant is referred to in one of the poems of Kircher's Interpretatio as "turrigera fera."'8 This is not just a way of speech, for we know that the obelisk was definitely considered to be a variant on the elephant's customary "tower" - "instead of gigantic towers, the elephant, the magister artium, now carries the Egyptian letters," exclaims one of the eulogists of Bernini's monument.19 The elephant and his howdah had come from India rather "late." Neither Homer nor Plato, neither the sculp- tors and painters, nor the dramatists and poets of ancient Greece had been familiar with the elephant. In classical writings the word elephas occurs mostly in reference to ivory. The change came about with Alexander the Great's advent. Especially his victory over King Porus' tower- carrying war-elephants, stimulated an interest in elephants that in manifold forms and through manifold channels entered the West and maintained its peculiar appeal far into the seventeenth century."2 This appeal was from the outset dual, as exemplified by Aristotle who would criti- cally study the physiology and the mores of the captives of the battlefield of the Hydaspes; and by Alexander, who at once set about imitating the attitude of semi-religious de- votion with which a Rajah of the type of Porus might treat his own favorite elephant. Alexander is said to have dedi- che haueva 25 anni, et era gravida, et era ammaestrata a fare diuersi giochi maravigliosi con la sua proboscide movendola a guisa di mano secondo che dal Padrone gli era commandato." Gigli, Diaria, 1655, as quoted by St. Fraschetti, II Bernini, Milan, 900oo, p. 306, note z. For the influence of the Poliphilo in France, cf. A. Blunt, "The Hypnerotomachia . . . in 17th Century France," Journal of the Warburg Institute, I, 1937-1938, pp. 117-137. 16. Ed. A. H6ron, Socie't rouennaise de bibliophiles, XLVII, S903, pp. 29 ff.

The direct influence of the Alexander romances, however, should not be overrated. Dr. Alfred Foulet of Princeton University very kindly undertook to check photostats of some twenty-odd MSS of the twelfth-century version of the Roman d'Alexandre. He found in them only three miniatures showing, in illustration of the King Porus battle, elephants carrying towers, none is prior to the fourteenth century; cf. MS franq. 24365, Bibl. Nat., Paris, fol. 52 verso (a very fine battle-scene) ; MS Bodleian 264, fol. 58 recto (diminutive elephants underneath the horses' bellies); MS Venice, Museo Civico, vi, 665, fol. 48 recto (showing one ele- phant within the circular ditch with which Alexander had sur- rounded him).

Westminster, 1895, passim; for the historical data cf. e.g., George Radet, Alexandre le Grand, Paris, 1931, pp. 281-282. The most important source of transmission of the contemporary reports for the West is the tenth-century Historia de preliis (8o, 23) which the Archpresbyter Leo had brought from Constantinople: "Erat enim exercitus Pori magnus ualde . . . et (habebat) quad- ragintos elephantos qui portabant turres in dorsa ubi stabant per unumquamque turrim triginta homines armati ad pugnandum ..."

The rapid western assimilation of elephant lore is partly owing to the fact that Alexander the Great created pat- terns which his immediate successors followed closely. Alexander himself commemorated his victory over Porus on the reverse side of a coin, which showed him on horse- back and his adversary riding his elephant (Fig. 7). He is said to have entered Babylon in a chariot drawn by ele- phants; and the representation of an elephant-triumph occurred, perhaps for the first time in art, in the decora- tion of Alexander's funeral chariot if we may trust the account of Diodorus of Sicily.22 The well known mimesis Alexandrou, if thus we may refer, for want of a better term, to the conscious reproduc- tion of the patterns established by Alexander the Great, in whose chain Pope Alexander VII curiously enough repre- sents one of the ultimate genuine links,23 began with the triumphant return of Dionysus from India. It need hardly be emphasized that in the first place Alexander imitated the god. The "Indian Triumph" lived on in man's imagi- nation and furnished the prototype for Roman military and imperial triumphs with elephants which, in turn, were re- vived in the trionfi of the Italian Renaissance.24 We have a description of such a Dionysian triumph as it was staged at Alexandria as part of the splendid pageant under Ptolemy II, in the third century B.c. The "Return of Dionysus from India," a tableau-vivant consisting of the statue of the god, some eighteen feet high, resting on the back of an artificial elephant, "directed" by the statue of a satyr-kornak, moved past the beholders in one of the carts.2" If in these first triumphs of the West the elephant with his howdah might appear as a symbol of vanquished might, in Roman ritual and art the elephant might be the tri- umphator, for the Romans had learned from Hellenistic rulers to use elephants in battle. Yet a third type was destined to become perhaps most important in mediaeval and post-mediaeval art and thought: the victorious elephant who perishes in his tri- umph. A well known and rigidly "stylized" topos in classi- cal antiquity was the fight that arose from the mortal en- mity that supposedly existed between the elephant and the serpent. This battle, with its various strangle-holds, led to the unavoidable climax of mutually inflicted death. 21. Cf.

Loeb, pp. 147 and 18I), where we are told that Apollonius saw Ajax when he visited the "Temple of the Sun." The name, "Ajax," fell at least tempo- rarily into disrepute when King Antiochus V's chief elephant by that name refused to ford a river, whereupon "Patroclus" became the leading elephant, and "Ajax," following the example set by his melancholy namesake, committed suicide; cf. Pliny, Historia naturalis, lib. viii, chap. v, sec. i1. Why does Shakespeare refer to the Greek hero as the "elephant Ajax"? None of his dramas offers perhaps such difficulties in ascertaining the exact degree of satire as Troilus and Cressida, where Thersites, temporarily beaten by Ajax, soliloquizes: "How now, Thersites! what! lost in the laby- rinth of thy fury. Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus?" (II, ii.) Earlier, Ajax had been described as being "slow as the elephant." This definition would not make much sense in the speech of one who has lost out. The reference is possibly to the elephant's notori- ous shrewdness and strength. For the satirical attitude of the Eng- lish in matters of zo6graphy and in particular elephantology, cf. note 117 infra. For the nature of the Hindu tradition, as Alexan- der may have found it, cf. the Mdta~iga-lild (ed. and tr. by Frank- lin Edgerton, s.t. The Elephant-Lore of the Hindus, New Haven, 1931, passimn). 22. For Alexander's entry into Babylon, cf. J. B. Friedreich, Die Symbolik und Mythologie der Natur, Wurzburg, 1859, p. 440. Diodorus Sic., lib. xvIII, chap. ii, claims that one of the tablets (?) that decorated the interior of this chariot showed elephants who carried armed Macedonians as well as Indian kornaks in their howdahs (?). Dr. Berta Segall of Princeton drew my attention to what must be considered the first pictorial recording of Alexander's triumph over King Porus, on a silver decadrachm issued by Alex- ander himself at Babylon. The obverse shows Alexander as god about to receive a wreath from Nike. The reverse shows him on horseback fighting King Porus, who is riding his elephant like a horse; cf. Charles Seltman, Greek Coins . . ., London, 1933, pp. 213 if. with further particulars, and pl. XLIx, nos. 6 and 7. Dr. Harold S. Jantz of Princeton University draws my attention to what may be only a curious coincidence with the above: the six- teenth-century description of the single combat between the "Chris- tian Emperor" (on horseback) and the "Sultan of the Turks" (on an elephant), in the Second Report of Doctor John Faustus ..., chap. xxii (ed. s.t. The English Wagner Book of 1594, by E. Richards: Literarhistorische Forschungen, xxxv, Berlin, 1907). I have been unable to trace a literary or pictorial source of trans- mission. In Arabic literature, though, a scene that is quite similar occurs: In ad-Damiri's zo6logical handbook, the late fourteenth- century Hayjt-al-Hayeazwn, it is reported how the King of China, who only the night before had in humble disguise approached Alexander the Great in his tent, unexpectedly "presented himself mounted on a large elephant, and with a crown on his head." Alex- ander was opposite him on horseback; here the identity ends, for the kings came to amiable terms j cf. edition and translation A. S. G. Jayakar, London, 1908, II, pp. 570-572. 23. Cf. note 148. 24. Cf. Botho Graef, De Bacchi expeditione Indica monumentis expressa (Diss.), Berlin, i886, pp. i2 ff. for elephants in Diony- sus' triumph on sarcophagi. The best survey of representations of classical elephant-triumphs on coins is still found in Gisbert Cuperus, De Elephantis in Nummis obviis, Hagae Comitum, 1719, passim. For the first use of elephants in a Roman triumph under Pompey, cf. Pauly-Wissowa, Realencyclopiidie, s.v. "triumphus," col. 504, 49 ff. According to Pliny (Hist. nat., lib. viII, chap. vi) Rome saw its first elephant-triumph in the year 275 B.c. For the survival of the elephants on the Roman triumphal arches on coins, etc., cf. Ferdinand Noack, "Triumph und Triumphbogen," Vor- triige der Bibliothek Warburg, 1925-1926, Leipzig-Berlin, 1928, pp. 185 ff. See also note 51. 25. The account of Callixeinus of Rhodos is found in the fa- mous description of Athenaeus' Deipnosophistae, lib. v, sec. zoo (ed. Loeb, II, p. 407). Goethe was inspired by this passage when in his Faust II (11. 5393-5405) he had an elephant appear; but his elephant was "turmbeladen" and the triumph of the god was turned into a triumph of Wisdom.</page><page sequence="8">16o THE ART BULLETIN A representation of this fight between the two animals may well be the earliest allegorical portrait of an eminent person in the guise of an elephant. Julius Caesar (whose gens, the Julia, prided themselves in the derivation of their name from the word elephas) prior to crossing the Rubicon is said to have struck a medal. The obverse shows, above the word CAESAR, the representation of an elephant trampling on a serpent (Fig. 8), as if thereby to announce to the Roman Senate, "you may vanquish the elephant, but in his death he will fall upon you and crush you." The cryptographers of the Renaissance - and quite rightly so - interpreted Caesar's medal as a hieroglyph for war (Figs. 9 a, b).26 In mediaeval animal-lore the fight between elephant and dragon became a fight between temperaments: the dragon, burning with thirst, waylays the coolblooded elephant. Of the very similar combat between elephant and rhinoceros we shall have occasion to hear more later on.27 The par- ticular pattern of this fight even recurs in the Old Testa- ment. We read in the first Book of Maccabees that Eleazar Avaran of Juda engages in battle the war-elephant who carries King Antiochus V Eupator. The mortal combat be- tween man and beast ends with the sacrificial death of Eleazar who, meeting the same fate as the waylaying dragon, is squashed by the collapsing elephant whom he had killed by splitting open his belly.28 Naturally Eleazar, who had "wanted to deliver his people and get himself a perpetual name," was celebrated as the spiritual victor. The element of renown leaves no doubt that here we have one of the rare instances of a secular triumph within the Chris- tian sphere. St. Ambrose, who celebrated Eleazar as an outstanding representative of "virtus bellica," ended his vivid account of the battle with the words: "Suo est sepul- tus triumpho."29 In the Speculum humanae salvationis, fi- nally, Eleazar's death (the scene had been illustrated at least as early as the eleventh century) was adduced as a prefiguration of Christ's sacrificial death on the Cross (Fig. IO).30 But the opposite interpretation comes from the same chapter of Maccabees. Antiochus' war-elephants were shown the juice of grapes and mulberries by their keepers, 26. Pliny describes the climax of the fight between elephant and snake (Hist. nat., lib. vili, chap. xi, sec. 32) as follows: "con- moriuntur ea dimicatione, victusque conruens complexum elidit pondere." For Caesar's coin, cf. H. A. Grueber, Coins of the Ro- mant Republic in the British Museum, London, 19 0o, II, pl. ciii, 5 for iconographic and historical problems involved, cf. p. 387 ibidemr; for the etymology of the gens Julia, pp. 390 ff. For Caesar's dealings with elephants in warfare and triumph, etc., cf. George Jennison, Animals for Show and Pleasure in Ancient Rome, Manchester, 1937, PP. 58 ff. For the Renaissance interpretation, cf. Pierio Valeriano, Hieroglyphica, lib. II, chap. ii, who, to be sure, does not mention the traditional end of the fight but shows the en- counter between serpent and elephant on two woodcuts (ed. Lyon, 16io, p. I6 "F" and "G"), as he has seen it "on Caesar's coin"; woodcut "F" (showing the snake surging up to the elephant in a bellicose attitude) is interpreted as "challenger to war," woodcut "G" (showing the serpent squashed underfoot by the elephant) as "war successfully brought to an end - bellum confectum.1" 27. I have been unable to find the elephant assigned to any given "temperament"; yet I have no doubt that being "cold," "moist" and capable of reaching an age of two hundred years (Aristotle et sequentes) he figured as the phlegmatic counterpart to the choleric dragon: "Dimicationis praecipua causa est, quod ele- phantis, ut aiunt, frigidior inest sanguis, et ob id a draconibus avidissime torrente captantur aestu" ; A. Neckam (De naturis rerum, libro duo, ed. Rolls series, London, 1863, II, p. 225) after Solinus. In a moral sense, his "frigidity" makes him chaste; "Elephas namque, cujus os est ebur, castum est animal et adeo frigidae naturae ut super os ejus, id est super ebur posito gracile lineo panno, et super pannum posita pruna exstinguatur illaeso panno. Et os continuum claudit corpus ejus, unde dicitur invulnerabile. Signifi- cat autem sanctos et castos a telis diaboli invulnerabiles"; Honorius Augustodun., In canticum canticorum, v, 14 ("Venter ejus ebur- neus, . . ."). For the elephant-rhinoceros fight, cf. infra, p. 170. 28. 1 Macc. 6: 43-46. The event is described very similarly in Flavius Josephus, Antiquitates, lib. xII, chap. ix, sec. 4. For the best scholarly resume of "quaecunque habentur de Elephantis in duobus Macchabaeorum libris," cf. Samuel Bochart, Hierozoicon sive de animalibus S. Scripturae . .., Leipzig, 1793, I, lib. II, chap. xxvii, pp. 257-268. Pliny's pronouncement: ". . . tergus ventri molle" (Historia naturalis, lib. viii, chap. x, 30) is part of the hunter's lore as I was pleased to hear from Dr. Remington Kellogg, Curator of Mammals in the Smithsonian Institution in a letter which I owe to Dr. Herbert Friedmann of the same In- stitution: ". . . a rip or puncture of this area would be a fatal wound to most animals, the elephant being no exception." 29. De officiis ministrorum, lib. I, chap. xl, J. P. Migne, ed., Patrologia Latina, xvi, cols. 81-82. The earliest illustrations of this scene date not prior to the eleventh century: (i) MS Leyden Perizoni 17, fol. 27 verso, reprod. A. Merton, Buchmalerei in St. Gallen, Leipzig, 1912, p. 64; (ii) MS Rod. B. iii, cod. lat. 6, Bibl. Nat. Paris, fol. 145 recto, reprod. Wilhelm Neuss, Die katalanische Bibelillustration . . ., Bonn and Leipzig, 1922, pl. 45, fig. 132. The latter is the only representation that to my knowledge shows Eleazar on horseback. 30. Cf. J. Lutz and P. Perdrizet, Speculunm humanae salvationis, Miihlhausen, 1907, chap. xxiv, 11. 9 1-98 and pl. 48. . Cum enim exercitus gentilium contra filios Israel bellavit, Eleazar occurens, elephantum eorum lancea perforavit, Qui sauciatus vulnere mortifero cecidit, Et super occisorem suum cadens, ipsum oppressit: Fortis impegit in fortem, et ambo corruerunt; Sic Eleazar in elephantem, et ambi morti fuerunt. Ita Christus fortis mortem inversit fortem Et per mortem suam nostram mortificavit mortem Eleazar in the Speculum appears traditionally along with two other self-sacrificing heroes (King Codrus of Athens and Valerius Maximus) as a prefiguration of Christ who in the first picture is shown on the Cross. Typically enough, the Renaissance, by way of transference, imbues the elephant-draco fight with the ethical value of Eleazar's deed, turning thereby, as is natural, the elephant into the true triumphator; cf. F. Picinelli, Mondo simbolico, Venice, 1678, par. 306, p. 199, who in the impresa of Bartholomeo Rossi, alludes to the elephant as Christ who dying vanquishes death; other Renaissance mottos in connection with the elephant vs. dragon fight are: VICTOREM VINCO, CAEDIT CUM CADIT, OCCI- SUS OCCIDIT, in which latter instances the dragon symbolizes the devil. For the mediaeval tradition, cf. G. C. Druce, "The Ele- phant in Medieval Art," Archaeological Journal, LXXVI, I919, pp. 33 ff.</page><page sequence="9">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK 161 to provoke them to fight. For this reason the elephant was interpreted as the symbol of the "Christian Soldier" who, beholding the blood that flowed from the side of Christ, enters the fight with the devil (Fig. 1 ).8" The continuous survival of the classical accounts of ele- phants in mediaeval letters, also pertains in the figural tradi- tion, especially with representations of war-tower-carrying elephants. This tradition can be traced from the third cen- tury B.c. down to the seventeenth century, where, after all, we find it still operative in Bernini's monument. For a representative classical example one might point to the war-tower upon a female elephant, shown on a South Italian dish of Gnatian ware, dating from about the first half of the third century B.c. (Fig. 12).32 In mediaeval convention, further proof of the persistence of tradition, we shall find tower-carrying elephants even where the text does not call for the tower at all.33 In mediaeval geography it is difficult to tell whether it is on account of mediaeval convention or direct classical tradition that the elephant with his castle appears on the relatively late remnants of the cosmos-maps of classical times. The Hereford Map, among the most important mappae mundi that can boast classical ancestry, drawn and painted in the thirteenth century, seems to suggest - by the very absence of the customary legendary information on elephants - the possibility of an ultimate antique pro- totype (Fig. 13). India is marked on the maps of this type by an elephant with an explanatory text which, in the case of the Hereford Map, runs as follows: "India sends the largest elephants whose teeth are supposed to be ivory and of whom the Indians make use in warfare by putting towers on them.""' 31. I Macc. 6: 34. G. C. Druce, op. cit., p. 26, draws attention to a marginal note in a thirteenth-century MS: "So also thou, O Christian man, when thou art about to enter the battle with the devil, in order that thou mayst be strengthened for bearing the ad- versities of this world, cast thine eyes on that cloth stained with the blood which flowed from the side of him that was crucified"i the much-quoted Richard of St. Laurent (thirteenth century) in his De laudibus B. V. M., lib. I (the passage is known to me only through F. Picinelli's Mondo simbolico, par. 329) writes as fol- lows: "Elephas viso sanguine non timet mori sed magis acuitur in proelium, &amp; Beata Virgo, viso sanguine Filij, effuso in cruce, mori cum ipso non timuit, sed magis optauit. . . ." Without direct refer- ence to Richard we find in Renaissance emblematics, in Jan David's Duodecim specula Deum aliquando videre . . ., Antwerp, 16io, among other mysteries of Christian revelation, the representation of an elephant, bending his right knee in front of a shining metal vessel (filled with blood) (pl. x, fig. H) (Fig. i1), which (on p. 140) is interpreted in a very similar manner: "Non dubium quo- que quin &amp; Martyres, bellatores egregij, ducis sui Christi strenui IMITATORES, forte in bello effecti sint, turn in primis Christi strategi nostri, vt dixi, tum aliorum Sanctorum praedecessorum EXEMPLO: quem admodum tempore Machabaeorum elephantes, sanguine uvae &amp; mori conspectu, in proelium acui consueverunt. Sic enim insigniores familiae nobiles praeclara suorum facinora depicta habere solent; quae ipsos suosque filios ac nepotes, ad eadem imitanda prouocarent." I Macc. 6: 37: "Sed et turres ligneae super eos firmae, protegentes super singulas bestias: et super eas machinae [war-engines]: et super singulas viri virtutis triginta duo, qui pugnabant desuper: et intus magister bestiae," would be interpreted, by Richard of St. Laurent, as the indestructible edi- fice of the Church, as it is supported by Mary (i.e., the elephant) - by her faith, good works, prayer, and example. Maurice Vlo- berg (La Vierge notre me'diatrice, Grenoble, 1938) has very con- vincingly interpreted the elephant with his castle underneath a representation of the Assumption of the Virgin (in the fifteenth- century Book of Hours of Adelaide of Savoy, MS Chantilly, xiv B. 9, fol. io8 recto) as an allegory in terms of this thirteenth- century concept (p. 78, with further interesting material on "La Vierge guerriere" and reprod. on p. 75, op. cit.). This allegorical projection that sees in the castle-supporting elephant an illustra- tion of the church-supporting qualities of the Virgin, allows us to interpret the words: "Tu elephantem maximum, Virgo humillima, tibi subjugasti." This line is found in the De septem gaudiis B. V. Mariae, vI, 1. 172, a work that (although independent) is often appended to the Speculum humanae salvationis. In this particular passage a number of mystical victories of the Virgin over various animals is enumerated. A negative interpretation (the only one I have been able to find) sees in the king the devil, in the array of battle elephants the tyrants, and in their towers the frailty of secular power; cf. Bible moralise'e, MS Brit. Mus., Harley 1526, fol. 7 recto, reprod. ed. A. de Laborde, Paris, 1913, III, no. 450. An attempt to interpret realistically the blood of grapes shown to the elephants before they enter battle is given by Ulysse Aldrovandi, De quadrupedibus solidipedibus, Bononiae, I616, p. 461, who hints at a parallel: the red cloth used to incite the bulls in Spain. His- torically it may well be a garbled version of older accounts which tell of elephants being incited to belligerence by wine, as e.g., Aelian, op. cit., lib. xIII, chap. viii. That this "Dutch courage" was not without danger to the elephants was pointed out by P. Gil- lius, Ex Aeliani hist., Lyon, I535, chap. xiii: "Vt elephantus uini potione obliuiscitur fortitudinis, sic simia hausto uino . . . non est capiendum difficilis"; elephants and apes are the only animals that habitually will get drunk (I owe this interesting bit of infor- mation to Dr. H. W. Janson, in whose forthcoming study on apes more will be found on this topic). It may be that the idea lingers in modern English slang, in phrases such as "to cop the elephant" = get tipsy; cf. E. Partridge, A Dictionary of Slang, London, 1938, q.v. 32. Museum, Villa Giulia. The painting was undoubtedly in- spired by the first elephants seen in Italy (cf. Pliny, Historia natu- ralis, lib. viII, chap. vi, i6); C. W. Lunsingh Scheurleer, Grieksche Ceramiek, Rotterdam, 1936, pl. XLVI, no. 134 and p. 145, and for an earlier type, a clay mold used for baking purposes, reproduced by G. A. S. Snijder, "Twee voorstellingen van strijdolifanten," Bulletin van de Vereeniging tot bevordering der kennis van de antike besckaving, II, 1927, pp. 9-II (with reproduction). Cf. also, for the theme in general, Cuperus' book mentioned in note 24 supra. The standard work on the use of elephants in warfare is still P. Damiano Armandi, Histoire militaire des e'le'p/zants, Paris, 1843. For the possible transmission of the motif through chessmen, cf. note 37 infra. 33. The best modern survey of the elephant and castle motif, especially in English art, is found in G. C.

Not one is known to have reached Europe between 802 and the first quarter of the thirteenth century. The last living ele- phant to put in an appearance - at the very threshold of the Middle Ages - was the once famous Abulabaz, whom Charlemagne is supposed to have received as a gift from the court of Harun-al-Rashid. Abulabaz died in 804 after nearly four years in Frankish hands. Although his presence was vividly recorded in contemporary chronicles, there is no immediate evidence of his presence in Carolingian art.35 On the other hand representations of elephants, by no means rare, drew on types "outside nature." In the ninth century we find on the one hand the earliest of the mediae- val Physiologus illustrations in the Codex of the Stadtbiblio- thek in Bern, and on the other the elephant of the so-called Lucca-Physiologus, which in every respect seems to stand at the end of the classical tradition (Fig. 15): in being an illustration of a chapter on the medical properties of the various parts of the elephant it is in line with writings of the type of Sextus Placidus' De medicamentis ex animalibus liber (Fig. 16), while iconographically it seems to derive from provincial Roman "venationes" of the type of the Bern elephant-mosaic from Avenches in Switzerland (Fig. 17).36 nects the conventional substance of the bestiaries with classical ac- counts. In later maps elephants will also be found to mark Africa, and it is with reference to those that Swift remarks: So Geographers, in Afric maps, With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o'er inhabitable downs, Place elephants for want of towns. Cf. the Genoese World Map (ca. 1457); reprod. George H. T. Kimble, Geography in the Middle Ages, London, 1938, pl. xvII. In seventeenth-century maps the elephant still appears, as on Gio- vanni Giacomo Rossi's map of the PENISOLA DELL INDIA, of the year 1683 (Mercurio geografico . . ., Rome, 1684, fol. xxxxI), elaborately emblazoned, with his mahout, and with apes hugging one another, and a native maiden pointing at the legend on his saddle-drape; but he is off the map and fills the void of the Indian Ocean. 35. That Abulabaz was carefully observed is shown by the re- mark in Dicuil's Liber de mensura orbis terrae (dated 825), chap. vii, sec. 35 (ed. Gustav Parthey, Berlin, 1870, p. 55): "Julius (Africanus) . . . de elephantibus . . . falso loquitur dicens, elephantem numquam iacere, dum ille sicut bos certissime iacet, ut populi communiter regni Francorum elephantem in tem- pore imperatoris Karoli viderunt." Abulabaz came from Bagdad, accompanied by his rector, the African Jew Isaac, and both win- tered at Vercelli (80o 1-802) on their way to Aix-la-Chapelle, where Charlemagne received the elephant along with other gifts from the East; cf. Paul Clemen, Die romanische Monumentalmalerei in den Rheinlanden, Dusseldorf, 1916, p. 711 and note 88 (in the one-vol. ed.). Abulabaz, now merely the object of footnotes, was, not so long ago, popularly as famous as "Bucephalus" or "Rosi- nante"; Dr. Panofsky drew my attention to a passage in Kortum's equally forgotten Jobsiade (ed. Miinster and Hamm, 1784, pt. I, chap. xxxvii, stanza 28) in which the author, fired - it seems to me - by Lucian's example, describes how none of the "great per- sonages" of history has been passed by Death (whom he calls Freund Hein) : Selbst Bucephalus und Rossinanten Abulabaz den Elephanten, Ross Bayard und Bileams Eselin Nahm Freund Hain zum Morgenbrod hin. In Carolingian literature we find - isolated and almost without sequence - the nearly altogether negative interpretation that ad- duces the physical "monstrosity" of the elephant as proof for his signifying the "sinner debased by his evil deeds"5 thus Hrabanus Maurus, De universo, lib. viii, chap. i, Patrologia Latina, cxI, col. 222: "Elephas autem significat peccatorem immanem sceleri- bus, et facinorum deformitate squalidum," to which, however, he adds: "attamen tales saepe ad Christum conuertuntur." This view is all the more astounding as it follows quite abruptly after the account which Hrabanus found in Isidore's Etymologiae (lib. xII, sec. 16). Hrabanus' further reference to the Queen of Sheba's visit to Solomon (III Kings Io: 22), and the import of "apes and ele- phants" (dentes elephantorum, are the words in the Vulgate), has remained almost without sequence, as far as I could ascertain. If we may assume that the Liber formularum, which goes under the name of St. Eucherius (fifth century), is indeed by that writer, a source for Hrabanus would be assured; for there we find (chap. v, "de animantibus"; Patrologia Latina, L, col. 751) under the sub- heading "Bestiae: diabolus, vel homines feri . . ." as part of a series of almost exclusively negative statements on the "moraliter" interpretation of animals, the identical reference to the elephant as sinner and to the apes and elephants of King Solomon. Hrabanus' allegory can naturally not be said to represent the Carolingian view on elephants: The Liber monstrorum de diversis generibus, of uncertain date (but apparently only slightly earlier than Hraba- nus' De universo) treats, in its second part, of the elephant without deviation from the "classical canon"; ed. M. Haupt, Berlin, 1863, p. 17, sec. 3 ; cf. M. Manitius, Geschickte der lateinischen Literatur des Mittelalters, Munich, 1911, I, pp. II4-18. For a late-mediae- val instance of the elephant as "man, the sinner," cf. note 44; see also note 75. 36. The Bern MS (318) illustrates the mandrake scene in fol. 19 recto and on the verso the hunting-story (cf. note 44 infra) and the baby elephant's water-nativity; cf. Helen Woodruff, "The Physiologus of Bern . . .," ART BULLETIN, XII, 1930, pp. 226 ff. and figs. 43 and 44. It should not be overlooked that the Bern illustrations, as Miss Woodruff has shown, go back to archetypes of the second to fourth centuries A.D. (p. 242 ibidenz). These, however, as I think, antedate the Physiologus. That they may have come from entirely different texts has been shown by Dr. Kurt Weitzmann who brought to my attention representations of ele- phants in the book-illumination of the third century A.D. which, we may assume, survive in a Greek tenth- (or eleventh-) century copy of Oppian's Cynegetica whose text (illustrated from the be- ginning) was composed around 212 A.D.; cf. MS graecum 479, R. Biblioteca Marciana, Venice. I am most grateful to Dr. Weitz- mann for permission to publish the elephant on fol. 36 recto from a photograph in his possession (Fig. 14); for the MS cf. A. W. Bijvanck, "De Geillustreerde Handschriften van Oppianus' 'Cyne- getica,' " Mededeelingen van bet Nederlandsch historisch Instituut, v, 1925, PP. 34-64 passim. The account of the elephant's birth in a watery hideout, in a swamp, on an island (not found in the Physi- ologus but undoubtedly derived from classical hints of the ele- phant's fondness for rivers and lakes) is related to the fear of dragons; Isidor (Etymologiae, lib. xII, sec. 16; Patrologia Latina, LXXXII, col. 436): ". . . quando autem parturiunt, in aquis vel insulis dimittunt fetus propter dracones. .. ." It becomes one of the stock accounts of the bestiaries. The character of the flight- nativity gives the elephant's birth a strongly messianic flavor. How- ever, a standard interpretation - as in the case of the plucking of the mandrake-root (cf. note 93) - does not exist. Thus we find (i) in the treatise De bestiis et aliis rebus (that often goes under Hugo de S. Victor's name), lib. II, chap. xxv, Patrologia Latina, CLXXVII, col. 72 (with a hint at Psalm XL 39]: 2) : ". . . prae-</page><page sequence="11">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK 163 The epoch that par excellence was ruled by the ex- emplar, which did not aim at similitude but rather at the "true" image as it pre-existed in the artist's mind, could well do without elephants as models and yet create the most convincingly beautiful elephantine creatures, such as the one in the twelfth-century Bestiary of Cambridge Uni- versity Library (Fig. 18)." Frederick II acquainted Italy and northern Europe with exotic animals once more. His menageries, among other rarities, contained elephants, and were for years on end and on many different occasions much in evidence.38 The influence of this novel source of "reality" may - in vari- ous stages ranging from timid attempts to masterly perfec- tion - best be studied in the work of an Englishman: in the chronicled accounts as well as the drawings by Matthew Paris. The account of the reception of Richard of Corn- wall in 1241 by the jubilant citizens of Cremona, accom- panied by their proudest show-piece, the Cremona elephant, is illustrated by a little drawing of the elephant with his castle (Fig. 19). In spite of much narrative detail which, in a way, is new, the elephant's figure still remains basically within the convention of the exemplar of the time. Mat- thew shows us the magister bestie quaintly ringing a bell as he steers the animal while his amanuensis prods it be- hind. In the elephant's castle a band of professional cheer- leaders, ten or more joculatores, are shown belaboring their various musical instruments and clapping their hands. The fete which the modern beholder may not be able to con- template without mirth was, in more than one respect, epoch-making. Apart from coming close to being a "tri- umph" in the Roman manner, it was without doubt the first late-mediaeval instance of the enactment of a secular princely entrede on record. But while these points may have escaped the participants, they were surely all aware of the fact that the elephant had come, as a gift to Frederick II, from Prester John's earthly paradise in the East, a most palpable corroboration of his famous Letter."9 cipitati sunt de paradiso in hunc mundum quasi in stagnum aquarum multarum." (ii) More charitable, in Alexander Neckam's "adap- tatio," De naturis rerum, lib. II, chap. cxlv, p. 226: "Sic sic antiquus draco hominem persequitur, sed ad aquas gratiae se transferat homo, ut ejus insidias vitet." (iii) In Richard de Fourni- val's Bestiaire d'amour the secret water-birth is held up as a pat- tern of amorous discretion that should be emulated by the lady; cf. G. C. Druce, Archaeological Journal, LXXVI, 1919, p. 32. The scene, male defending mother and child against the onslaught of the dragon, is shown, e.g., in MS Sloane 278, reprod. by Druce, op. cit., pl. II, no. i. I am greatly indebted to Dr. Hanns Swarzen- ski for permission to publish here for the first time the elephant of the Lucca MS 296, R. Bibliotheca Governatica, fol. 50 verso. The literary source has yet to be established. For its "prototype," cf. the Roman elephant in the mosaic at Bern (Bibliotheque de la Ville), W. D6onna, L'Art romain en Suisse, Geneva, 1942, pl. 94. 37. MS I i. 4. 26, fol. 7 recto; ed. in facsimile, M. R. James, Roxburghe Club, Oxford, 1929. Sources of influence, primary as well as secondary, existed in abundance. In the treasures elephants might be found apart from MSS and chessmen on textiles, cf., e.g., the Byzantine eleventh-century tissue in the Reliquary of Aachen, reprod. O. von Falke, Decorative Silks, 3rd ed. New York, 1936, fig. 185. Mention has often been made of the possible influence of chessmen qua chessmen on the mediaeval and post-mediaeval ele- phants who carry castles in the West. But the "castle" or rook de- rives from the Indian war-chariot and has no relation, as the name might erroneously suggest, to the elephant's castle. The influence of the "third piece" of the old Indian game, which does show the elephant with (ordinarily) two fighters in his castle and a kornak on its head, has never been great. Although such pieces could be found in mediaeval treasures they were, to our knowledge, never recognized and therefore never used in the Western chess game itself. When chess entered Europe in the eleventh century, it was in the abstracted shapes of the Arabian chessmen. The "third piece," al fil (hence modern French "aufin" and "fou[1l]," corresponding to our bishop), had been denaturalized into the shape of a cone with two fairly shallow horn-shaped excrescences - the latter the quondam soldiers of the figurative Indian prototype. The Arabian chessman to which mediaeval players referred as "cornutus," be- came, by way of association with the bifurcate bishop's mitre, the bishop of the European chess game. For the problem as a whole and in particular for the very striking eleventh-century piece in the Fitzhenry Collection, in England, in which a bishop, wearing his "two-horned" mitre is carved into the flank of a double-horned Arabian al fil, cf. Adolph Goldschmidt, Die Elfenbeinskulpturen aus der romanischen Zeit, Iv, Berlin, 1926, fig. 19 on p. 7 and chap. "Die Schachfiguren," pp. 4-7. For the possible relation: In- dian figurative chessman --thirteenth-century English church carving, cf. note 48 infra. It is interesting to note that in mediaeval China a situation prevailed with regard to elephants that in many ways offers parallels to that of the European Middle Ages. Ele- phants were, at least in northern China, hardly known at all - yet they were being represented in "a long tradition of inaccuracy," while off and on a single specimen would reach one of the im- perial menageries as a tributary gift from the South; ef. A. C. Soper, "Four Columns from a Chinese Temple," Honolulu Acad- emy of Arts Special Studies, I, April 8, 1947, pp. I4 f. (and fig. 3), where the artistic repercussion of one of those rare visitors is related to the general background. 38. For a discussion of Frederick's menageries, and for further bibliographical material, cf. Ernst Kantorowicz, Kaiser Friedrich der Zweite (Ergdinzungsband), Berlin, 1931, p. 137. A wealth of interesting information on owners of animals in the Middle Ages will be found in a charming little study which Dr. Hanns Swarzen- ski brought to my attention: Alexander Kaufmann, "Ueber Thier- liebhaberei im Mittelalter . . .," Historisches Jahrbuch (G6rres- Gesellschaft), v, 1884, pp. 399-423. 39. The Cremonenses, always Frederick's favorites, offered what may be called an entrie with the one modification that their ordre marched out of the town (although we can safely assume that they would have brought Richard back with them). Matthew's source was the Duke himself, "hoc comes plenius narravit," and the account in the Chronica majora (London, Rolls Series LVII, 1872-1883, IV) reads: "Appropinquanti autem Cremonam veniebant obviam gaudenter Cremoneses, elephantem imperatoris mirabiliter ornatum producentes, et portantem machinae ligneae propugnaculum, in quo quidam magistri bestiae residebant, tubis canentes, et manibus joculando applaudentes." For Matthew's drawing cf. MS Parker 16, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, fol. 151 verso; reprod. M. R. James, "The Drawings of Matthew Paris," Walpole Society, XIV, 1925-1926, pl. xvi, no. 80.

Prester John's Letter (extant from the twelfth cen- tury on in many versions) was finally circulated as addressed to Frederick II; it contains interesting reports of elephants and their use on journeys (cf. note 51 infra) but there is no allusion to the</page><page sequence="12">164 THE ART BULLETIN The palm for "intended realism" has always gone to Villard de Honnecourt's famous lion. Villard noted that he had drawn him "al vif" (Figs. 20 and 2 I).40 It has been pointed out that what counted is his claim, the Wollen, rather than his achievement, the K5innen. Yet, the second stage in Matthew Paris' mastery of the elephant's appear- ance, as represented by the set of drawings of the elephant who reached England in 1255, as a gift from Louis IX to Henry III,41 stands on an altogether different level as a documentation of the newly awakened "realism" of the thirteenth century. The finest of these huge sketches shows the African elephant, tied according to mediaeval custom, to the stump of a tree (or pole) as he is tended by his mas- ter, one "Henricus de Flor."42 The explanatory legend, which Matthew added to his magnificent sketch, represents one of the primordia in the evolution of proportional studies. Here for the first time proportional relations are rendered pictorially and in perfect illustration of an explicit state- ment to the effect that "by the size of the man drawn here, the size of the beast which is here represented, can be esti- mated" (Fig. 22).43 These qualities not only raise Matthew Paris' elephant of 1255 above his first drawing of 1241, but also mark a decisive step in the evolution of mediaeval seeing and think- ing. As an artistic achievement, the later drawing repre- sents a fundamental change in objective. As a "scientific" gift of an elephant to the Emperor in any of the versions I have been able to see. The best brief survey on the pertinent aspects and a select bibliography on the Prester John Letter will be found in Rudolf Wittkower, "Marvels of the East," Journal of the Warburg Institute, v, 1942, p. I8i and notes. Brunetto Latini, I1 Tesoro di Brunetto Latini, volgarizzato da Bono Giamboni . . ed. P. Chabaille, Bologna, 1878-1883, 1, p. 246, mentions the derivation of the Cremona elephant: "E si dicono li Crimonesi, che il secondo Federigo ne men6 uno a Cremona, il quale a lui aveva mandato Prete Gianni d'India." Mention might here be made, if only curiositatis causa, of France's "official" primordium of a princely entre'e on the authority of Theodore Godefroy (the great seventeenth-century specialist on fetes) who claims (Le Cire- monial frangois, Paris, 1649, I, p. 634) that the first was good King Gontran's entry into Orleans on 4 July 585, when "immense crowds came out to meet him with standards and banners, singing songs in his praise" 5cf. Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks, lib. viii, chap. i, ed./tr. 0. M. Dalton, Oxford, 1927, II, p. 329- 40. Villard, it should not be forgotten, has two lions "al vif" ; the first one (Album, fol. 24 recto, ed. H. R. Hahnloser, Villard de Honnecourt, Vienna, 1935, pl. 47) has certain merits where realism is concerned. The second one, en face (ibidem verso, ed. cit., pl. 48) appears with the legend: "lion, si com on le voit par de- vant; et sacies bien qu'il fu contrefait al vif." This statement means only that Villard wants us to know that he worked from the living model. It does not exclude the legitimate fact that between Villard and the model there stood the pre-established vision of "what-a- lion-ought-to-look-like." This vision may well have been of a composite nature; at any rate we cannot point to any one absolute prototype. Leonardo Olschki, Guillaume Boucher . .., Baltimore, 1946, on pp. 83 ff., I14 ff., has some interesting if not entirely convincing observations on Eastern prototypes. One might point even closer to Villard's range of possible acquaintance, viz., to the Lion of St. Mark at Venice, whose head agrees with that of Vil- lard's down to small details (such as the hole at the root of the lion's nose - where the two fail to agree, the bronze lion has been restored) ; cf. the excellent reproduction in J. B. Ward Perkins, "The Bronze Lion of St. Mark at Venice," Antiquity, xxI, 1947, no. 81, pls. i-iv, and fig. I, indicating restored parts, such as the curls crowning the lion's head and the paws, which may almost be reconstructed from Villard's drawing. I am once more indebted to Dr. Hanns Swarzenski for permission to publish here for the first time the remarkable representation of the Lion in the original manuscript of the Liber floridus, MS 92 Ghent University Library, fol. 56 verso (Fig. 2i), completed iio20; this representation, as Dr. Swarzenski pointed out to me, must somehow have been at the back of Villard's mind when he drew his lions, which is doubly as- sured by the fact that the porcus ["spinosus" scil.] of the Liber floridus recurs on Villard's page as the almost identical porcupine. For a discussion of the Liber floridus cf. L. Delisle, "Manuscrits du 'Liber Floridus,' " Notices et extraits de manuscrits, Paris, 1905, xxxvIII, pt. 2, pp. 577, 583, 585. 41. The transaction is described by Matthew Paris, Chzronica majora; he adds the following reflection: "Nec redimus quod un- quam aliquis elephas visus est in Anglia, immo nec etiam in partibus cisalpinis, praeter illum; unde confluebant populi ad tantae specta- culum raritas" j the elephant died after four years in the Tower; cf. H. Sands, "Extracts from the Documentary History of the Tower of London," Archaeological Journal, LXIX, 1912, p. 166. 42. The "de flor" in the keeper's name might stand for Florence (de Florentia) but equally well for "de Floriaco," and in the latter case refer to one of the two or three "Fleurys" in France; cf. P. C. E. Deschamps, Dictionnaire de ge'ographie, Paris, x870, s.h. vv. The only other keeper known by name might well be a Frenchman who in that case would have taken over from a native mahout. Dr. Foulet informed me that France had been around the middle of the thirteenth century host to at least two elephants, as suggested by the following sources: (i) Jean Sire de Joinville, Histoire de Saint Louis . . ., ed. Natalis de Wailly, 3rd ed. Paris, 1874, sec. 518 on p. 284, where we find an enumeration of gifts sent by the Emirs of Egypt to the French king: "Et avec ces choses, evvoierent au roy un oliphant que li roys envoia en France" (date: between I251-1252) ; this may have been the African elephant that finally reached England. (ii) On the wax-tablets of Johannes Sarraceni (cf. Guigniaut et de Wailly, Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France, xxI, 855, P. 355 H, par. 205 (also par. 54 e; cf. Index) the following payment is listed as having been made on behalf of St. Louis on 14 November 1256 (i.e., after Henry de Flor and his elephant had crossed the Channel) : "Peluau, qui gardet l'orifant, per regem, XX. s [ = 20 solidos]." Another possibility, however vague, should not be overlooked: the word peluau may have been the Frenchmen's fairest possible phonetic approximation to Arabic for "keeper of the elephants," viz. fayydl; cf. ad-Damiri, Haydt-al-Hayawin, ed. and tr. A. S. G. Jayakar, London, 19o8, II, p. 567. 43. A study of Matthew Paris as an artist is still needed. Repro- duction by M. R.

The inscription reads: "Henricus de flor . . . / magister bestie. // per quantitatem hominis / hic protracti con- siderari potest / quantitas bestie hic figurati [sic]." Three hundred years later, observations of comparable succinctness again appear when Girolamo Cardano describes the young elephant at the court of Mary of Bohemia: ". . . illius altitudo tanta erat, ut homo erectis manibus non attingeret dorsum," De subtilitate, Basel, 1553, p. 307.</page><page sequence="13">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK 165 document it is a straw in the wind that blows in the direc- tion of a new era of discovery: In the naturalists' investiga- tion pari passu with Matthew Paris' realistic portrayal, the understanding of the elephant's nature reaches - in the van of the Aristotelian revival - the highest level since late-classical times. Albert the Great not only knew Aris- totle on elephants but had been at pains to gather, in the course of his own extremely rich and detailed studies of elephants' physiology and mores, fresh information from "reliable" travellers abroad. Albert was the first once more to explode the seemingly immortal libel that "elephants have no joints," not by weighing authorities but simply by arguing that elephants would then be unable to walk in a co-ordinated manner."4 Nevertheless the "jointless" ele- phant remained the sine qua non of the most popular and long lived of all elephant-legends and moralizations. In later years the fallacy had to be assailed time and again by enlightened spirits such as Petrus Gillius (1535), Girolamo Cardano (1552), Frangois Rabelais (1564), Shakespeare (ca. 16oo00), Thomas Coryate (1616), David Ferrand (1627), Sir Thomas Browne (1646), and undoubtedly many others.45 Even more menacing, at least to elephant- 44. Before Albertus Magnus, Alexander Neckam, author of one of the earliest "school books," the De naturis rerum, expressly cited classical authority (Solinus and Cassiodorus) in writing about the elephant. Even where he found occasion to offer the odd allegorical "adaptatio," he quoted authority in the spirit of humanistic allu- sion (citing beside the Bible the classical authors) rather than in the spirit of homiletic or mystic interpretation (lib. II, chap. cxliii begins: "Refert Cassiodorus . . ."). Cassiodorus himself had dealt with the properties and peculiarities of the elephant by way of a learned aside, attached to an order to put on their feet again a set of third-century bronze elephants. His account, which fits into his grandiose scheme to restore the dilapidated monuments of classi- cal antiquity, is conspicuous through its lack of allegory (Variae, lib. x, epistola xxx, Patrologia Latina, LXIX, cols. 818 ff.). Vincent of Beauvais, Albertus Magnus' great counterpart in learning, is perhaps of all thirteenth-century compilers, the least speculative and the most comprehensive. His chapters on the elephant (Specu- lum naturale, ed. Strassburg, s.a. (ca. 1480), II, lib. xx), xxxvIii to LII, offer an entirely uncritical assemblage of excerpts from classical as well as mediaeval authorities; his quotations begin with the name of his authority, be it Aristotle, Pliny, Solinus, the Physiologus or Thomas of Cantimpr6's Liber de naturis rerum. Where he quotes the Physiologus, he will often omit the moraliza- tion. The quotation is usually close enough to contain nothing of Vincent's own stand. Albertus Magnus' approach differs from both the bestiaries and the "school books" of the type of Alexander's De naturis and of Vincent's Speculum: One instance will suffice to illustrate both Albertus' method of original inquiry and his catholicity of interest which in this particular case embraces, as we would now call it, folklore as well; in his De animalibus, lib. viii, tract. i, chap. iii, par. 31, we hear of the African "mask-hunt": "Et hoc idem narravit michi fide dignus, qui in terra illa fuerat, addens quod percussor [here: "the one who wounds the animal"] elefantis horribili colore pingit caput et faciem, et transfigurat se, ne postea cum domesticatus est elephas, possit cognosci: quia aliter elefas interficeret eum." About the elephant's joints Albertus (op. cit., lib. xxII, tract. 2, chap. i, par. 51) sums up: ". .. si nullas haberet flexuras, non posset habere gressum ordinatum." It might perhaps be argued that Albertus' voice was drowned out by the murmur of the "imperiti," but he stood by no means alone with his tenet. Bartholomaeus Anglicus, e.g., wrote in his alphabetically arranged lexicon (a book that was in everyone's hands at Paris Uni- versity) with respect to the elephant's ability to recognize royalty: ". . . reuerentiae gratia sua genua incuruant," and elsewhere "Elephas autem quando sedet flectit pedes suos sed non potest flectere pedes iiij propter pondus corporis sed fulcitur ["balances"] super latus dextrum vel sinistrum &amp; dormit stante copore &amp; pedes posteriores flectit sicut homo" (De proprietatibus rerum, lib. xviii, chaps. xli and xlii). Both Albertus and Bartholomaeus seem to have had Aristotle (Historia animalium, II, i) in mind, who grants that the elephant is able to bend his legs but only with great diffi- culty so that (and this is borne out by modern zoology) he prefers to sleep in an upright position. On the other hand, the tenet of the elephant's absolute lack of joints was time-honored and tenacious: Ktesias had been the first to broadcast it; cf. Pauly-Wissowa, Real- Encyclopdie, v, p. 2249, 42 ff. and Max Wellmann, "Der Physi- ologus .. . ," Philologus (Supplementband) xxII, i, 1930, p. 30, with further bibliography and data which show that classical writ- ers were about divided on the point. For the problem as a whole cf. also G. C. Druce, op. cit., p. 28. Hence the account - second only in importance to that of the mandrake (cf. note 93) - of the elephant-hunt (n.b. that Julius Caesar, Commentarii, lib. vi, chap. xxvii, tells the same story of the alces of Germania, without, as is needless to say, the happy ending, let alone an added moral) as follows: the hunters weaken the oldest elephant's "sleeping tree" so that he will collapse with it as he tries to lean against it at night. On account of his stiff-jointedness he will be unable to raise him- self unaided. When he trumpets, thirteen older elephants hasten to his succor, but in vain - until the fourteenth, the smallest of the elephants, comes, who puts his trunk under the oldest elephant and rolls him over. This was understood to signify the Fall of Adam (the oldest), whom Moses and the prophets tried to help to his feet again. Only Christ (the tiniest elephant) could succeed. The story, still lacking in the Physiologus, becomes the most frequently told legend in the bestiaries. An Italian group stands apart: the narrative ends with the elephant's death and the moral indicates that the elephant represents man the sinner (under the spell of Superbia) who heavily leans on things terrestrial and is overcome by the devil; cf. Ein tosco-venezianischer Bestiarius, ed. M. Gold- staub and R. Wendriner, Halle, I892, p. 6o; no doubt a revival of Hrabanus' peccator immanis (cf. note 35 supra) as has been ob- served by Goldstaub and Wendriner, p. 419, note I. Finally, the animal fable at the close of the Middle Ages shows an interesting attempt to pacify the mutually exclusive statements that the ele- phant "greets his king" (Pliny) and that he cannot bend his knees. No. 89 of Nicolaus Pergamenus' Dialogus creaturarum tells how the elephant is denounced for not having curtseyed as his king, the lion, passed through the forest. The elephant, having assured the lion of his good will, "sed flectere me non possum, propter quod genua non habeo," is absolved and his denigrators are repre- hended; ed. J. G. Th. Grdsse, Die beiden altesten Fabelbi2cher des Mittelalters . . ., Tiibingen, 1880, p. 237. For interesting variants of this legend cf. G. C. Druce, op. cit., pp. I ff. and Friedrich Lauchert, Geschichte des Physiologus, Strassburg, 1889, pp. 34 ff. Johannes Sambucus (1534-1584), a Hungarian (best known as court physician and historian to Maximilian II), one of the earliest emblematists, depicts the elephant leaning against his tree and un- aware of the hunter who vigorously belabors the tree with his axe: so easily can be overcome he who "in proelia Martis / Arma, viros, turrim, tergore vectat opes!" Thus was Atalanta deceived by the golden apples, the Peliades by Medea's ruse and, apparently, Sam- bucus senior, to whom the emblem is dedicated under the motto NUSQUAM TUTA FIDES, by people whom he had given every- thing: cf. Emblemata, Antwerp (Plantin), 1564, p. 184. 45. Petrus Gillius (commenting on Aelian's Historia animalium, lib. I, chap. ii, ed. Lyon, I535, pp. 28 ff.)

Matthew Paris' achieve- ment remained without sequence. Even if the elephants are henceforth seen with finer discernment of reality, we are made to feel in most cases that their true habitat is in the do- main of fantasy and legend. Yet a decided stimulus did come from the elephant in the Tower, "whither," as we are told, "everybody hastened on account of the rareness of the sight." This elephant's physical presence is reflected in a host of church-carvings, on misericords and even, it seems, in the metalwork on a tombstone. The new degree of intensity with which reality was appercepted has, in one particular instance, been beautifully demonstrated by Rich- ard Bernheimer who pointed out that the howdah of one of the finest specimens, in Ripon Cathedral, was made after an Indian prototype.48 Little need be said about the qualitative influence of the thirteenth-century journeys of exploration into Far East- ern lands. Most explorers, faithfully bound to their ex- emplars, set out in order to find their miraculous notions corroborated. One glance at the fourteenth-century Livre des merveilles,49 for instance, proves that the illuminator fell back upon pre-established images. The best scenes are those of elephants in battle but they too are realistic only in a limited sense: we see the almost identical scene used twice for two entirely different frays."5 Even a hunting scene in the guise of a triumph, in which the great Khan's wooden aedicula rested on the back of four elephants, seems a reflection rather of the early Italian "trionfi" than an at- tempt to follow the detailed description in Marco Polo's account.51 bus &amp; capite salutavit"; Frangois Rabelais, Faicts et dits he'roiques du bon Pantagruel, v (posthumously publ. in 1564), chap. xxx: "Ils ont joinctures et articulations es jambes; ceux qui ont escrit le contraire n'en veirent jamais qu'en peinture." I can only hazard the guess that Rabelais in the last year of his life had seen the elephant who had gone to Austria on his way from Spain more than a decade before; for Shakespeare's pronouncement, cf. note 117 infra; the title page of Thomas Coryate's Traveller for the English, London, 1616 (reprod.

The "wooden room," which the Khan had to use on account of his gout, looks like a council-chamber rather than a howdah, although its features are described in some detail in Marco Polo's account; cf. The Description of the World, I, ed. A. C. Moule and P. Pelliot, London, 1938, p. 231. Kublai Khan's suc- cessors who, as we know, were not plagued by gout, inherited the idea of the hunting-castle on the elephant and evolved out of it what may be called the "hunting triumph on elephants" 3 cf. Henry Yule, Ye Book of Ser Marco Polo, London, 1874, I, p. 394. Francesco Colonna's so-called "Second Triumph" (fols. k vij verso and k viii recto of the ed. prima) shows Leda drawn by a team of elephants, as in the hunting picture of the great Khan. On the other hand, Colonna's trionfo is closely related to a "Triumph of Re- nown" enacted in Naples under the direction of Sannazaro on the last day of Carnival 1492; cf. Francesco Rorraca, Studi di storia letteraria napolitana, Livorno, 1884, Appendice. This trionfo has come down to us in tapestries of the early sixteenth century; cf. Heinrich GSbel, Wandteppicke . . ., Leipzig, 1923, I, part 1, p. 105 and R. van Marle, Iconographie de l'art profane, The Hague, 1932, II, fig. 154 on p. 134.

The Renaissance trionfi differ from Marco Polo's and Prester John's (which latter, after all, are triumphs only in regard to the accoutrements) in that in the Renaissance proper, teams of ele- phants (who are usually hitched before chariots) are seldom if ever used as castle-carriers also. Only the single elephant, and we shall hear more of him, remains as elephant-caryatid. Obviously those who designed the trionfi of the Renaissance had made them- selves familiar with classical triumphs, especially those on coins; cf. Werner Weisbach, Trionfi, Berlin, 1919, p. 64 and note x. I know of only one classical triumph with a quadriga drawn by a pair of elephants who at the same time are carrying elaborate towers on their backs; cf. F. Imhoof-Blumer and O.

This may also well be the first genuine secular triumph of the Middle Ages in that it was designed to celebrate a victory in the field. Frederick had beaten the Milanese in the autumn of the year 1237 and his victory came to a climax with the capture of the Carroccio of the city of Milan. Frederick entered Cremona in triumph followed by the captured chariot, which paraded not only the Lombardic insignia but also the fettered Podest~ of Milan. The chariot was drawn by Frederick's elephant, who "on his back carried a wooden citadel, as well as trumpeters, along with the imperial banners, amidst the frantic applause of the multitude of spectators."52 In the fifteenth century we meet with the first life-size elephant-automaton, the unconscious revival of a type not uncommon in classical antiquity,53 destined for unprece- dented popularity in the sixteenth century. On February 17, 1453, a banquet was held in honor of Philip of Bur- gundy at Lille. At a solemn intermezzo young Olivier de La Marche, chief of the Burgundian school of rhetoric,"4 who on this occasion acted as the master of ceremonies, ap- peared - as we learn from his own Mimoires - disguised as a nun and sitting in a castle on the back of an elephant whose kornak was a gigantic Saracen. The dame whom Olivier impersonated was none but holy Church herself, who recited a threnodic lament on the dangers threaten- ing her from the Turks. This intermezzo, so bizarre even to our hardened taste for the legitimate scope of religious propaganda, was felt to be a sobering and beautiful note at a festivity which otherwise disconcerted even the master of ceremonies by its untimely lavishness and frivolity.55 Thus artists and the masters of festivities sensed that the elephant with his castle would lend dignity and worthy adornment to any pageant. Colonna's creation of the ele- phant-obelisk combination merely added a spirited variant to an already time-honored motif. I have been unable to find an immediate prototype.5G Probably Colonna who was much aware of obelisks thought out this new variant of an old theme himself, so much in keeping with the funda- mental program of the Hypnerotomachia, which sought to fuse Graeco-Roman and Egyptian past into the all-over vision of his very own sacrosancta antiquitas. Italy had a rich tradition of elephants carrying burdens other than nondescript castles. An eleventh-century team of elephants supports the massive Bishop's throne at Canosa (Fig. 23). Colonna may have seen a creation of his own period: the impressive elephant-caryatids of the chapel of Sigismondo at the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini. These support an intricate, monumental, and noble structure in whose niches appear the figures of several virtues (Fig. 24). He might also have seen a rendering as in the fif- teenth-century MS of the Passion of St. Maurice, which shows a very beautiful elephant carrying the Doges' Palace at Venice as well as a pond with swans and ducks in it (Fig. 25).57 52. Cf. Petrus de Vineis, Epistolarium, pt. ii, no. I, ed. Am- bergae, 1609, pp. 240 ff. The "castelluin ligneum," far from try- ing to compete with Prester John's, seems to have been fashioned after the carroccio of the Lombards5 cf. Salimbene's Chronicle, ed. Mon. Germ. SS., xxxII, p. 94 (ad an. I236), with interesting references to Antiochus V and Alexander the Great. For further details cf.

Memoires, lib. I, chap. xxix, ed. H. Beaume and J. D'Arbaumont, Paris, 1884, II, pp. 361-368. Simon Marmion, Jacques Daret and other great artists were in charge of the arrangement of this banquet. Olivier does not bother to interpret the elements of this elephant-trionfo, although we may assume (note 31) that elephant, castle and dame were meant to represent mystically the various parts of the Church. The Church as menaced by external dangers would ultimately derive from Dante's trionfo of the Church (Purgatorio, xxxii), where there is no elephant, to be sure. But the elephant's mortal enemy, draco, lashes out at the chariot in which "Ecclesia" is seated. In the fifteenth century, on the other hand, the elephant is found in what may possibly be a political broadsheet: Alart du Hamel's en- graving of the "besieged elephant" after an original composition by Jerome Bosch. This elephant, a sorely wounded giant topped by a magnificent tower-excrescence, may well be a representation of "Turkey at Bay." The assailing forces, national as well as ethical, it seems to me, are represented not only by men operating the weirdest of war-engines but also by warriors mounting various animals, unicorn, bear, bull, lion, and others; the scene has wrongly been related to I Macc. 36i cf. Jacques Combe, Jrdome Bosch, Paris, 1946, no. I42. The type is by no means unique. Dr. Panof- sky drew my attention to a political satire in which Emperor and Pope are shown as wrestlers and the Emperor (Frederick III) holds the Austrian double-headed eagle while his foot rests on the Burgundian lion; cf. Elizabeth Mongan and Carl O. Schniewind, The First Century of Printmaking . . ., Chicago, 1941, no. 22, reprod. p. 35. Miss Mongan very kindly drew my attention to what may well be another political allegory, preponderantly en- acted by beasts, by the Master of the Beheading of St. John which shows a lion attacked by a dragon, in turn attacked by a bear and a unicorn in the presence of a man with a shield; cf. A. M. Hind, Catalogue of Early Italian Engravings, British Museum, London, 1900, section E 18. 56. The only specimen, that possibly might antedate Colonna's, is a rather crude elephant topped by an obelisk at a side-entrance of the thirteenth-century Church of S. Corona at Vicenza; re- prod.

The elephant brought to my attention by Dora Panofsky (apart from Bernini's Minerva-elephant one of the rare elephants who by an outspoken contrapposto move of head and trunk seem to be conscious of their load) is found on fol. 39 recto of MS Bibl. de l'Ars. 940; reproduction H.

But the motif of the elephant with his castle (or some similar object as a substitute) had gained in popularity. Jerome Bosch's enigmatic composition of the "besieged elephant," we have had occasion to mention."8 An engraving by Schongauer shows the conventional type of elephant and castle basically unchanged but realistically convincing."9 In the early sixteenth century, the motif ap- pears decoratively stylized in a French printer's mark.60 Later in the century it is used as a hyper-ornate fireplace decoration in Wendel Dietterlin's Architectura (Fig. 26).61 Finally in I639 the elephant appears as the center- piece of an ivory table-decoration by one Markus Heiden. The artist's quaint explanation shows how noble a topic the elephant with his tower was felt to be. The elephant ("the size of a young dog") has a battle-tower out of which grows a column, that is crowned by the chalice; then fol- lows a human Atlas who in turn supports a galley with the mast topped by a star. "No one has ever thought out such a master-piece," is Heiden's own conclusion. He interprets the inmates of the battle-tower (in an allusion to his own name) as the heathen representatives of the four conti- nents, and the vessel on top as the ship that, after many tribulations, safely carries the good Christian to port (Fig. 27).62 One type, perhaps the most interesting, ca. 1587, leads over to the life-size automatons; it is a wind-up ele- phant-automaton on wheels whose "castle" is made to look like a tent in which an African warrior can be seen with bow and arrow. When the clock is wound he releases his arrow (Fig. 28). This beautiful little piece derives, as Wolfgang Born has shown, from the Islamic elephant carrying a water-clock, found as early as ca. 1200 in al- Jaziri's treatise Of Automatons.63 These few instances, which can easily be multiplied, remove any doubt about the ubiquity and popularity of the motif of the elephant as caryatid. But Bernini's literary and iconographic sources, apart from Colonna's woodcut, lead to the monumental elephants in Italian and French pageantry of the Renais- sance. In an age that incessantly endeavored to temper the vision of fantasy with that of reality, it is interesting to find that the dearth of real elephants64 did not deter the de- signers of masques, intermezzi and princely entries from decreeing a wealth of mobile, life-size elephants. Olivier de La Marche's elephant of the year 1453 was perhaps the first western automaton."6 The illusionistic quality of the six huge artificial elephants at the 1550 entree of Henri II into Rouen is described by a witness: "They were - in their appearance, color, proportion of limbs - so close to real elephants that even those who had seen live ones in Africa would not have judged them imitation elephants, if they had seen them" (Fig. 29).66 How the life-size au- 58.

Nuremberg, 1598, part i, fol. 18; Dietterlin's ele- phant, although grotesquely ornate, is quite realistically rendered as he assists a Moor, obviously his kornak, to ascend him by offering his right tusk and his trunk as successive steps. He has, incidentally, two striking motifs in common with Bernini's elephant: the turn- ing of head and trunk and the shabrack which almost touches the ground. 62. Cf.

Heiden's claim that "no one ever had thought out such a masterpiece," may well be accepted with regard to the purely technical achievement it represents; but in all its basic motifs it is a conglomeration of the well known stand-bys of elephant allegory; even the ship oc- curs in the great entree of Rouen (155o) : In the Second Group of elephants one "portoit vn n'auire for bris6 &amp; derompu, les mastz voilles &amp; funaille deschirez &amp; froissez, comme s'il eust est6 pris a vn abordage ou combat de mer"; cf. the anonymous print C est la deduction du sumptueux ordre . . ., Rouen, 1551 ; facsimile- ed., Socie'te' rouennaise de bibliophiles, xxvi, Rouen, 1885, no pagi- nation. 63. Dr. Richard Ettinghausen of the Freer Gallery of Art kindly drew my attention to the fact that the Islamic water-clock of al-Jazdri was adapted in the sixteenth century. Wolfgang Born's article s.t. "Early European Automatons, ii," The Connoisseur, c, 1937, PP- 247 ff. and figs. III and Iv. For the earliest representa- tion of the Islamic piece, cf.

From about 2z6o till 1655 only three elephants are ascer- tained for Italy (I5Io, 1630, I655); a few more north of the Alps: the earliest, 1482 (Cologne), i55z (Vienna). In the first half of the seventeenth century two or three are known in France, England, and Holland. For the early instances north of the Alps, cf. Alexander Kaufmann, op. cit., note 38, pp. 409 ff. and 423. 65. Life-size automatons in Renaissance festivals are mentioned by Jacob Burckhardt, on "Festivities," cf. ed. The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, London-New York, 1944, pp. 245 ff. Renaissance writers were familiar with the classical prototype of the elephant automaton, the giant-elephant in Ptolemy's procession, mentioned among others by Ulysse Aldrovandi, De quadrupedibus solidipedibus, ed. Bononiae, 1616, pp. 471 ff. in his chapter on the elephants' "usus in triumphis." Classical antiquity also employed true automatons as weapons of morale or even as plain military ruses: (i) Queen Semiramis kept artisans hidden in a secret factory where they made elephant-dummies of oxen-hides. These con- cealed riders on camels. Semiramis moved them against the Indians, hoping that "they would be struck with terror because of their be- lief that no elephants existed at all, apart from those found in India"; cf. Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, lib. II, chap. xvi, 8 ff. (ed. Loeb, I, pp. 403 ff.), quoted again by Ulysse Aldro- vandi, op. cit., p. 475. (ii) The Macedonians, anxious to accus- tom their cavalry to Roman elephants, had wooden models of elephants. These must have been illusionistic to the last detail, and were equipped with men who not only trumpeted from within but they were also furnished with "a dreadful odor": cf. Loeb, loc. cit., p. 406, note z. 66. C est la deduction . . ., ed. cit., chap.

The artificial elephants of the pageants show that Ber- nini could look back upon a rich tradition of life-size ele- phants who on the one hand perpetuated the Indian how- dah of Alexander's days and on the other showed their limitless adaptability to all kinds of loads, from perfume- censers to men-of-war."6 If learning and fantasy had seized upon the elephant caryatid as an almost unlimited variable, it is strange that no obelisk-carrying elephant recurred before Bernini's - with the exception of straight copies and sketches after the one in the Hypnerotomachia.69 A partial answer comes from the forbidding peculiarities of Colonna's own text and interpretation. But another point has to be considered as well. One treatment of the motif has interesting bilateral filiations, closing, as it were, the gap between Colonna's and Bernini's works of art. Bernini must have been aware of the engraving that showed the gigantic rhinoceros monu- ment of 1549. It greeted Henri II on the occasion of his solemn entry into the city of Paris. This colossal piece of wood and canvas, beautifully painted to give the impression of porphyry, jasper, and serpentine, was anchored some seven feet deep in the ground, and showed the rhinoceros triumphant; under his feet a dying lion, bear, boar, and wolf. On his back was placed a triangular obelisk, some seventy feet in height, topped by a figure of France70 stand- ing on a golden sphere and about to put her sword into the scabbard (Fig. 30). The meaning of each part of the monument emerges from the official relation of the Ordre. The face of the obelisk contained on a square slab the vows and wishes of the Parisians, expressed in hieroglyphic char- acters, to the effect that Force and Vigilance should guard the Realm, celebrating the king as "triumphator" over his enemies. An inscription in French finally dedicated the "sacred obelisk" to his Royal Majesty."7 The influence of Colonna's woodcut is obvious. The same Jean Goujon who was the decorator of this entree was almost certainly also responsible for the woodcuts of the French version of the Hypnerotomachia which had been first published in 1546.72 Two questions now arise: why should a rhinoceros have taken the place that was legitimately and logically the ele- phant's? why did the towered elephant survive and flour- ish as a Renaissance curiosum and as a decoration piece but never as a personal impresa? A definite answer to both questions is at hand. cussed by Ferdinand Denis, Une Fete bre'silienne ceilbrie a Rouen en 1550 . . ., Paris, 1850, pp. 20 ff.

In the i55o entrie at Rouen alone we find finely wrought castles with banners and war-emblems, the model of a captured man-of-war, and perfume censers, symbolizing the King's laigresse. 69. Cf. note 14. 70. The figure of France is probably derived from Colonna's gyrating Fortuna atop the "Obelisk on Pyramid" (fol. b verso, Hypnerotomachia, Venice, 1499) ; further links between this monu- ment and Colonna's opus will be discussed in the text to note 67. Christian Huelsen ("Le illustrazione della 'Hypnerotomachia Polifili' e le antichitt di Roma," Bibliofilia, xII, 1910o, pp. 167 ff.) has pointed out that Colonna's structure represents the first known attempt at an "ideal reconstruction" of the Mausoleum at Halicar- nassus based on Pliny's text. 71.

The detailed description of the monument as well as the interpretation of the hieroglyphs with many arbitrary deviations from the Hora- pollocanon, are found on pp. 9 ff. The monument is shown on p. Io, the upper part of the obelisk pasted on so that it can be folded up (Fig. 30). Cf. also Josiphe Chartrou, Les Entries solennelles et triomphales a' la Renaissance (1484-z551), Paris, 1928, pp. 112 ff., with reproductions and interesting observations on the use of obelisks in France from 1533 onwards, and Pierre Champion, Paris au temps de la Renaissance . . ., Paris, 1936, p. 115. The first to discover the connection between Colonna's woodcut and that of the year i55o was Rene Schneider, op. cit., figs. on pp. 90o and 91. The "monoceros" representing the King as a Force of Light overcoming the lion and other animals repre- senting the Forces of Darkness ultimately stems from ancient Persia; cf. Glanville Downey, "The Pilgrim's Progress of the Byzantine Emperor," Church History, Ix, I940, pp. 207-217, especially p. 2z6 and note 75 infra. We must not forget (and I should have, had not Dr. Panofsky reminded me), that the Persian concept of the "royal hunt" links the unicorn (as always) with the Moon and on the other hand the lion, strangely, with both Sun and Forces of Evil; this interpretation is fitting enough, for Henri II, to whom the monument was dedicated, had, for his impresa, the crescent moon with the motto: DONEC TOTUM IMPLEAT ORBEMi cf. Torquato Tasso, "Il Conte . .," Dialoghi, ed. C. Guasti, Florence, 1859, III, p. 404 and (for the moon-emblem) Fig. 29.

Moreover, the king was a great hunter; cf. E. E. J. Bourciez, Les Moeurs polies et la littirature de cour sous Henri II, Paris, 1886, pp. 25 ff. In 1549 the city of Lyon greeted the king with an artificial emboscade, from which the goddess Diana emerged, her brow crowned by the "croissant," leading a tamed lion (symbol of the city) "toute douce, gracieuse et humiliee "a ses loix et commandements"; cf. Seigneur de Brant6me, Oeuvres, ed. Paris, 1850, Ix, p. 318. In other words, those who chose the rhi- noceros to honor and represent Henri II must have been prompted not only by the animal's popular appeal but also, undoubtedly, by esoteric considerations. 72.

Josephe Chartrou, op. cit., p. x 133 also note 70 supra.</page><page sequence="18">170 THE ART BULLETIN The rhinoceros that greeted and honored Henri II at Paris is, of course, a direct descendant of Diirer's famous woodcut of 15 15."7 Diirer himself, as we know, had never seen a rhinoceros; he had worked after a sketch depicting the unique rhinoceros at Lisbon in the menagerie of King Emanuel I. The specimen itself, which had been dis- patched from Portugal by the king as a gift to Pope Leo X, never reached Italy, for it suffered shipwreck and was miserably drowned. An elephant of the same menagerie, Hanno by name, reached the Vatican safely. Hanno greeted Pope Leo with genuflexions and poured the water he had deliberately concealed in his trunk, over the onlooking cardinals.7" The untimely death of the rhinoceros must have caused consternation, since Leo X had wished to match the two animals (who according to ancient theory were natural-born enemies) in single combat."5 Such a fight had been staged only shortly before in Lisbon and, horribile dictu, the elephant saved his life only by headlong flight.76 This fact - implicitly broadcast all over Europe by the inscription on Diirer's woodcut - undoubtedly served as a potent argument against the much-vaunted prowess of the elephant and as an equally weighty recommendation of the invincible rhinoceros as a fitting impresa for the valiant king of France. Obviously the case lay different with Alex- ander VII. Torquato Tasso, well aware of the Lisbon affray, had given eloquent praise to the elephant's self-im- posed meekness. In Bernini's day the pachyderm's robust- ness had been deprived of its muscular tone; the fact that elephant Hanno's cousin in Portugal had suffered igno- minious defeat at the mere threat of the horn of the rhinoc- eros could not remotely sway the Pope in his choice of the elephant as the caryatid of his obelisk. All concessions made, we may say that the step that led from Goujon's rhinoceros to Bernini's elephant was one of modulation rather than mutation. In either case the func- tion of the obelisk was to represent a "sacred" ideal that was sustained by its respective allegorical beast. The beast, in either case, was a symbol of qualities and traits of char- acter and mind that the person thus allegorically portrayed had acquired through self-discipline and the experience of life. The obelisk represented the indispensable counterpart: the "unacquirable" blessing from above. Both beast and obelisk share the dual tradition, trionfo and impresa. Gou- jon's successful transformation and adaptation of Colonna's basic idea for a royal triumph must have acted for Bernini as a powerful recommendation of the fifteenth-century woodcut ex post. The main significance is that we can trace a spiritual evolution that led from an antiquarian curiosum, advocat- ing "Zeal and Industry"; through an impermanent struc- ture made of wood and canvas, celebrating regal Valor and inspired Guidance; to a timeless and permanent granite and marble monument, dedicated, as we shall see, to men- tal Acuteness, and Genius as a gift of divine Inspiration. 73. Cf. E. Panofsky, Albrecht Diirer, 3rd ed. Princeton, I947, II, no. 356 with bibliography. 74. L. Madelin, "Le Journal d'un habitant frangais de Rome au XVIe siecle . . .," Me'langes d'arc/he'ologie et d'histoire, xxII, 1902, p. 277. The elephant entered Rome along with other gifts from the King, conducted by Tristan da Cunha, the Portuguese envoy, on 20o March 1513. Hanno was subsequently frightened out of his wits when in a mock-ceremony he was all dressed up in gold; cf. Burckhardt, Civilization, ed. New York, 189o, p. 158 and note. 75. In mediaeval bestiaries the rhinoceros, as "monoceros," was generally mixed up with the unicorn (see also note 71); his ferocity (to be softened only by a virgin) surpassed that of any other known beast. On the mortal enmity between rhinoceros and elephant, see Pliny, Historia naturalis, lib. viii, chap. xxix, 7' (ed. Loeb, p. 53) : "(The rhinoceros) bred here to fight matches with an elephant gets ready for battle by filing its horns on rocks, and in the encounter goes specially for the belly, which it knows to be softer." Some authors hold the issue of the fight a foregone conclusion; cf. Oppian, Cynegetica, lib. 11, 550 ff. (ed. Loeb, p. Io5): "He attacks the elephant strong though it be and many a time lays so mighty a beast dead in the dust." The best survey is found in Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopidie, v, s.v. "Elefant," col. 2251, 29 ff.; on the rhinoceros, cf. Berthold Laufer, Chinese Clay Figures, Chicago, 1914, chap. i. It should, however, be added that Diodorus Siculus (Library of History, lib. III, chap. xxxv), the first to mention the enmity, gives the elephant a fair chance once he has overcome the rhinoceros' initial onslaught, on account of his "superior strength." St. Isidore (Etymologiae, lib. xii, sec. xII) mentions the enmity and the elephant's locus minoris resisten- tiae. Hrabanus Maurus (De universo, lib. viii, chap. i, Patrologia Latina, v, col. zzi) compares the rhinoceros to the Apostle Paul ("superbos ventris cultores occidit") and even to Christ ("propter invictam fortitudinem"), without, however, creating a tradition, cf. note 35. 76. Cf. the beautiful account in Campbell Dodgson's "The Story of Diirer's Ganda," in A. Fowler, The Romance of Fine Prints, Kansas City, I938, pp. 45-46 and Richard Salomon, "A Trace of Diirer in Rabelais," Modern Language Notes, LVIII, i943, P. 499 and note 6. The rhinoceros was even rarer than the elephant. Since Roman days this was the first specimen Europe saw (5 14-I516), the next one - portrayed by the Longhi, sung by Gellert - was brought to Holland in 1741 and visited Augsburg in 1748 (C. Dodgson, op. cit., p. 45). The Lisbon fight ("vicitque Rhinoceros") was reported throughout the sixteenth century: e.g., (i) Girolamo Cardano, De subtilitate, p. 314; (ii) Conrat Gesner, Thierbuch . . ., ed. Zurich, 1563, fol. cxxxi recto: "Soelcher hassz so soelche zwey scheiitzliche thier gegen einanderen tragend / ist auch in der Statt Vlysbona erschinen / in welcher ein Elephant soelche Rhinocer / welches abconterfetung hiebey gesetzt / geflochen / als die kauffleilt selber bezefiget / welche auch vil von der listigkeit / frcelichkeit / schnaelle / vnnd geschwindigkeit diss thiers erzellet habend"; (iii) the Ordre of the year 1549 (p. 9 verso) seems to imply knowledge of the com- bat: "animal d'Ethiopie nomm6 Rhinoceros . . ., ennemy mortel de 1'Elephant, &amp; qui de faict le tue en singulier combat, non- obstant qu'il ne soit pas du tout si hault, mais bien egal en sa longueur"l (iv) Torquato Tasso, whose sympathies are very ob- viously on the elephant's side, after having given due praise to "Anno" for his mental capacities, remarks: ". . . poteva figurare l'elefante co'l rinoceronte in battaglia, ma volse piiu tosto mostrarci la sua mansuetudine, che la ferocit"" cf.

The most superficial acquaintance with the current writings on animals shows that no one was moved to laughter at the sight of an elephant. Well into the seventeenth century, an atmosphere of awe and mystery surrounded him on his rare visits to Europe. Even if he was silent "he could under- stand." Those whose moral life was deficient might feel shame in the presence of an animal who (but for one un- willing encounter with his mate) was forever chaste. No one could fail to see that in strength and bulk he surpassed any other known animal. All in all he was the most pal- pable guarantee for the existence of all the other marvels of the East, the unicorns, the dragons, the simians as well as the humans of extraordinary shapes and sizes - all of them witnesses of God's "inexplicable plan of the world," or "creations of God's wrath . . . foreshadowing ex- traordinary events."" In Bernini's day elephants were as rare as Red Indians." We have his own word for it as, on the occasion of his princely entry into Southern France, in the spring of 1665, he jestingly said of himself "che viag- giava l'Elefante." But to "travel like an elephant" meant, as Bernini no doubt also wished to imply, that he felt him- self to be the object of royal honors.7 Such honors had been awarded to elephants from time immemorial, in the course of a tradition which reached the West from Indian sources, at the time of Alexander the Great,8" and, transmitted by Pliny and others, survived through the Middle Ages. Ber- nini might well have heard of the extravagant precautions which the French had taken to prevent anyone from see- ing the elephant who had arrived in France before the King himself (Louis XIII) had laid eyes on him.8' 77- Cf. Rudolf Wittkower, "Marvels of the East," Journal of the Warburg Institute, v, 1942, pp. 159 ff. 78. Both elephants and Red Indians figured as choice show- pieces. The elephant primarily suggested "Christian Virtue In- carnate"; the Red Indian represented the unexpected realization of the Renaissance dream of the "Noble Savage" of the Tacitus- Montaigne variety. It is diffcult now to imagine how exciting it must have been when both were present at the great Rouen entrie of the year 1550, the automaton-elephants as well as real Brazilians, and it mattered little that as far as the latter were concerned, their ranks were swelled by worthy counterparts to the artificial beasts: French sailors painted to look and indoctrinated to speak like American natives; cf. Ferdinand Denis, Une Fete bresilienne . .., Paris, 185o, passim. The decline was fast and steep: at and soon after the turn of the century both elephants and Indians were be- ing exhibited for money: (i) Giglio, Diario, May 1630 (as quoted by Fraschetti, II Bernini, Milan, 1900, p. 306, note i): "In questo mese fu condotto a Roma un Elefante animale, che gia per cento anni se ne era visto, da che ne fu mandato a donare uno dal Re di Portogallo a Papa Leone X nel 1514. Ma questo era di un homo privato il quale anco faceva, a chi voleva vederlo, pagare un giulio"; (ii) we may assume the same for Holland only shortly after from John Evelyn's observation in his Diary (13 August 1641) : "We arrived late at Rotterdam, where there was their an- nual . . . fair . . . Here I first saw an elephant"; (iii) Shake- speare, referring to an actual event, wrote in the Tempest (II, ii) : C". .. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian . . ."; and in the same scene we have the situation in a nutshell, when Stephano hesitates as to whether he should give Caliban to an emperor or sell him. Not only the abstruse size ("masculus maximum habet membrum genitale," Girolamo Cardano, De subtilitate, p. 308) but the ex- clusiveness of the elephant's testicles recommended them as leather for young Gargantua's purse (op. cit., lib. I, chap. viii: "Sa bourse fut faicte de la couille d'un oriflant, que lui donna Her Pracontal, procunsul de Libye"). 79. We read in Baldinucci's Vita del Cavaliere Gio. Lorenzo Bernino . . . (original ed. 1682, p. 46, as reprinted by Alois Riegl, Vienna, 1912, p. 195): ". . . Erasene gih in ogni luogo, dov' egli doveva passare sparsa la voce per modo, che si spopolavano, per cosi dire, le Citta, per desiderio, che aveva chiascuno di vederlo, tanto che egli per piacevolezza diceva, che viaggiava l'Elefante." Bernini was not unaware of the highly organized planning behind his "triumphant entry" into Southern France; cf. L6on Mirot, "Le Bernin en France . . .," chap. ii, Me'moires de la Sociedt de l'his- toire de Paris et de l'Ile-de-France, xxxI, 1904). Bernini's remark was pointed, and applicable to the occasion only. Naturally, he did not wish to refer to his own personal appearance, nor had he been given at the French court "le sobriquet d'Elifant," as E. P. Rodochanachi (Les Monuments de Rome . . ., Paris, 1914, p. 88) contends. We have M. de Chantelou's testimonial: ".. .. le cava- lier Bernin est un homme d'une taille mediocre, mais bien propor- tionnee, plus maigre que gras, d'un temperament tout de feu. Son visage a du rapport d'un aigle, particulierement par les yeux," and Bernini's own, in his self-portrait of I6665 cf. Brauer-Wittkower, II, pl. io8. 80. In Hindu antiquity the elephant belonged to the king. This fact deeply and lastingly impressed the Greek and Roman authors; cf. Pauly-Wissowa, op. cit., s.v. "Elefant," col. 2255. In imperial Rome elephants were kept only by the emperor. Elephants "knew their king," they did "homage to their king by kneeling before him and proffering garlands" (Pliny, op. cit., lib. VIII, chap. i); they were animals royal, not unlike the Elizabethan swans in the British Isles, which even if owned privately came under the juris- diction of a Royal Swan Herd; cf. John Witherings, Esq., Master and Governor of the Royal Games of Swans and Cygnets through- out the Kingdom of England, The Orders, Laws and Ancient Cus- toms of Swans, London, 1664 (reprint ed. William Oldys, Harleian Miscellany, III, London, 1809, pp. 375-379), in which orders are cited that go partly as far back as the fifteenth century. Aurelian was the first private burgher of Rorne to receive and accept an elephant as a gift; this was rightly interpreted as an omen of his being destined to become an emperor; cf. Ludwig Friedliinder, Darstellungen aus der Sittengeschichte Rom. .. ., i oth ed. Leip- zig, 1923, p. 83. Aurelian's extraordinary case is mentioned in Pierio Valeriano's Hieroglyphica, lib. II, chap. ii, Lyon, 61io, p. 15, under the explicit heading: "Aegyptij Regem hominem (i.e., "a right royal person") per elephanti simulacrum intelligebant," whence it enters into emblematic writings; qf. Giulio Cesare Ca- paccio, Delle imprese, Naples, 1592, lib. II, chap. vii, fol. 17 verso. The elephant was felt to look regal himself: "Oculi quidem parvi, sed graviter se moventes. Credas aliquid regium ejus intendisse conspectum. Despicit scurriliter ludentes . . .," cf. Cassiodorus, Variae, lib. XI, epistola xxx, Patrologia Latina, LXIX, col. 819. 81.

The elephant, along with other animals, real as well as legendary, had early been ad- duced as a moral allegory within the terms of Christian theology. The Physiologus (in circulation from at least the fourth century onward) model of innumerable hierozoica to follow, and by no means itself the first in attempting to interpret animals allegorically,82 presented the elephant as chaste and intelligent, and treated male and female on ac- count of their peculiar marital relation as a prefiguration of Adam and Eve. The bestiaries of the Middle Ages fur- nished additional stories and traits and subjected them in turn to Christian moralisatio. Almost all these accretions, adding to the high esteem in which the elephant was held, can be related to classical sources.83 The classical "canon" of both mediaeval and Renais- sance elephant-lore can be found in the eighth book of Pliny's Naturalis historia, which, directly or indirectly, was read, excerpted, and paraphrased throughout the Mid- dle Ages.84 In Leonardo da Vinci's Notebooks, we find it copied in extenso.85 The allegorical, moral, and emblematic interpretation especially of those animals on which the Middle Ages had focussed its attention forms a fascinating chapter in Renais- sance letters. The writers and the artists of the Renaissance, far from spurning mediaeval tradition (which, after all, throughout the Middle Ages had been replenished with classical substance ever anew), consulted Pliny as well as the Physiologus, Aelian as well as Bartholomaeus Anglicus; and did not hesitate to enliven both the classical and the mediaeval accounts with fictions and interpretations of their own. Renaissance procedure, if illustrated with a few ex- amples chosen more or less at random, will relate Bernini's choice of the elephant to a general pattern. This pattern is distinguished by a seemingly limitless and pronouncedly subjective range of "interpretability," while it is held together by a strong unity of feeling for the immense probity and humanness of the elephant. The emblematic animal which the Malatesta, possibly in imitation of Julius Caesar, had adopted was the elephant. Elephants of different shapes and functions appear all over the Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini, on family escutcheons, sarcophagi, on Malatesta medals, and other objets d'art.86 The Malatesta elephant was not, as has often erroneously been asserted, restricted in his symbolical character to any one given quality; 8" but while the range is great it is worth noting that all qualities refer to outstanding virtues. Pliny tells how the elephants will rid themselves of flies by surreptitiously contracting the wrinkles of their skin in which the insects had settled down.88 This bit of informa- tion, disregarded by mediaeval bestiaries, was destined to become a great favorite with the emblematists of the Renaissance. Thus revived and morally interpreted it first occurs at Cesena, at the entrance of the Biblioteca Mala- testiana.89 There we encounter two elephants with the defiant motto ELEPHAS INDUS CULICES NON phant de Henri IV," Bibliothkque de l'Ecole des Chartes, LIV, 1893, pp. I-5. 82. The clearest and most penetrating discussion of sources and antecedents of the Physiologus appears in Max Wellmann's article, "Der Physiologus . . .," Philologus (Supplementband), xxxI, I, 1930, pp. 3 if., 1z 2 ff. and parsim. 83. Cf. note 44. 84. On Pliny's popularity in the Middle Ages cf. K. J. Sillig, "Ueber das Ansehen der Naturgeschichte des Plinius im Mittelal- ter," Allgemeine Schulzeitung, 1833, nos. 52, 533 J. E. Sandys, A History of Classical Scholarship . . ., znd ed. Cambridge, 19o6, I, pp. 653 ff., and Max Manitius, "Handschriften antiker Autoren in mittelalterlichen Bibliothekskatalogen," Zentralblatt fiir Biblio- thekswvesen, Beiheft 67, 1935, no. 49. The one and only classi- cal monograph devoted to the elephant, Amyntianos' 1-pil 'EXcvTw-yv, known only from excerpts, has been of comparatively little influence; cf. Pauly-Wissowa, op. cit., s.v. "Elefant," col. 2251, 11. 2-9. 85. On elephants, Leonardo seems to have excerpted Pliny alone 5 cf. Leonardo, The Literary Works, ed. J. P. and I. A. Richter, London, New York, II, 1939, no. 1245, secs. 1245-1248, p. 269, s.t. "Leofante"; for Leonardo's sources, cf. E. Solmi, Le Fonti dei MSS di Leonardo da Vinci, Turin, 1908, pp. 235-246, and M. Goldstaub and R. Wendriner, Ein tosko-venezianischer Bes- tiarius, Halle, 1892, p. 245, note 2 (ad p. 244). 86. Cf. Corrado Ricci, II Tempio malatestiano, Rimini, n.d., chap. xi. 87. The variety of emblematic and heraldic use is clearly shown by Ricci, op. cit., p. 322. 88. Pliny, op. cit., lib. viii, chap. x. Although the story is found in none of the moralizing bestiaries that claim descendance from the Physiologus, the "schoolbooks" of the thirteenth century knew it: "Pellem habet nigram quasi pumiceam et scabiosam in quam cadunt muscae, quas in rugas contrahendo pellem interficit"3 cf. Albertus Magnus, De animalibus, lib. xxII, tract. 2, chap. i, par. 5o, ed. H. Stadler, II, p. 1376; similarly Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum naturale, lib. xx, chap. xxxviii; their source may well have been Thomas de Cantimpr6, De natura rerum (ante I244), lib. Iv (a long overdue critical edition of this complete text is being prepared by Professor Pauline Aiken of Connecticut College), as the passage occurs also in a later author, who is strongly influenced by Thomas: Conrad von Megenberg, who in his Buck der Natur (ca. 1350i ed. prima Augsburg 1475, fol. 84 verso) writes as follows: "vn so fliegen auff irem ruck [back] siczen so zieher sij die haut in runczeln vn klemen [squeeze] die fliegen zu tod / wann [because] sij haben nit affter wedel da mit sij sich weren." The story flourished in the emblematic books of the Renaissance. F. Picinelli, Mondo simbolico, 2nd ed. Venice 1678, lib. v, chap. xxiii, sec. 333, offers a Spanish dictum ALLA MEYOR QUE PUEDO ("as well as I can") by way of moral, a motto that probably derives from Giulio Cesare Capaccio's (Valeriano-in- spired) handbook Delle imprese . . ., Naples, 1592, lib. II, chap. vii, fol. 20 ff. Capaccio claims to have invented the motto so that in conjunction with the representation of the fly-beset ele- phant it might offer an "impresa di giusta vendetta." 89.

Whereas here we had a case of a straight classical re- vival, one allegorical portrait, belonging to the same am- bient, should perhaps be explained from the account of the bestiaries. It is the Malatesta elephant on the reverse of Matteo de' Pasti's well known medal of 1446, portraying Isotta da Rimini (Fig. 32). This elephant has variously been interpreted as a symbol of Magnanimity9" or Chastity or Humility."' None of these explanations fits the case. Isotta's biography rules out unconditional chastity; for not only had she been Sigismondo Malatesta's mistress from about 1438 onward, but at the time the medal was struck she was pregnant. It appears indeed likely that Sigismondo in issuing the medal wished to give public acknowledge- ment of the expected offspring.92 One might try to see in the nondescript plant, which the elephant seems to be about to approach with his lowered trunk, not the Malatesta rosebush but a mandrake. If this were acceptable, we would have an allegory that is almost entirely derived from the mediaeval account. The Physiologus tells the story of the female elephant who cannot conceive unless she pro- ceeds to the gate of Paradise, in order to pluck the man- drake, eat of it, and also give of it to her husband to awaken his otherwise dormant sexual desires. This oldest and most popular of all mediaeval elephant accounts, in all its ele- ments a purely Jewish story, related only very loosely to classical reports concerning the elephant's notorious slug- gishness in sexual matters, has from the very beginning been interpreted as an allegory of the Fall of Man. Im- plicitly the eating of the mandrake, the sine qua non in the elephant's marital life, was understood to signify that the elephant - both male and female - is the prototype of the ideal Christian spouse who will mate without sexual appetite, solely for the sake of offspring."3 I suggest that we might see on the reverse of Isotta's medal such an allegory of "Chastity in Marriage."" In the early seventeenth century the elephant had lost nothing of his high moral renown. The Milanese cele- brated in 1610 the canonization of their greatest saint of modern times, San Carlo Borromeo. On this occasion the representation (most likely on a painted drapery) of a tight- rope-dancing elephant was shown. The elephant was meant to portray San Carlo allegorically. To this end a classical source had been boldly re-interpreted. A passage in one of Seneca's Letters compares the man who knows how to subdue the world's trials, to the tiny Ethiopian who can make an elephant walk on the tightrope. Picinelli, identifying the saint, not as we would expect, with the Ethiopian, but with the elephant, tells us that the picture was exhibited to show "how San Carlo had arrived at perfection and saintliness by walking on the steep path and by sub- duing to his discipline the oppressive weight of the body that had been a load to the soul" (Fig. 33).9 90o. G. F. Hill, A Corpus of Italian Medals . . ., London, 193o, p. 40, no. 167, pl. 32; Hill misinterprets the fly-motto and assumes that it should be applied to all Malatesta elephants5 cf. note 87. 91. H. Zimmer, Das Spiel um den Elefanten . . ., Munich, 1930, p. 40. Chastity is, indeed, a tempting interpretation; yet Pisano offered the unicorn and the crescent moon; cf. Cecilia Gonzaga's medal of the year 1447 (reproduced J. Friedlinder, Die italienischen Schaumiinzen . . ., Berlin, 1882, pl. V, no. 19 and p. 37. Another unfounded suggestion is L. Volkmann's (Bilder- schriften der Renaissance . . ., Leipzig, 1923, p. 12), probity and meekness. Isotta is by no means the first lady to be allegorically represented by an elephant: Baudouin de Conde dedicated his "Contes de l'olifant" (second half of the thirteenth century) to Margaret, Countess of Flanders in praise of her "elephantine" qualities of valor, wisdom, charity, humility5 cf. Baudouin's Dits et contes . . ., 11. 222 ff., ed. August Scheler, Brussels, 1866, I, p. 240. 92. Cf. C. E. Yriarte, Un Condottiere au XVe siecle, Paris, I882, p. 40. 93. Cf. Latin Physiologus (ed. based on versio B, Francis J. Carmody, Paris, 1939, p. 57). For the Jewish sources of this story and its moralisatio, cf. Max Wellmann, "Der Physiologus . . .," Philologus (Supplementband), XXII, 1930, p. 41. Most classical authorities emphasize the elephant's modesty in sexual matters - "pudore numquam nisi in abdito coeunt" (Pliny, op. cit., lib. viii, chap. v, after Aristotle), and "non enim libidinosi, neque ut lascivi, cum femina coeunt; sed tanquam generis successione carentes liberis procreandis dant operam, ne stirpe sua deficeret" (Aelian, Historia animalium, lib. vIII, chap. xvii). The mediaeval accounts of the elephant's chastity are numerous. Honorius of Autun's commentary In canticum canticorum (5:14), Patrologia Latina, CLXII, Col. 443, compares the "venter" of the "dilectus" (since it is of ivory) to those ". . . habentes uxores, tamquam non habentes, fidem castitatis conjugibus servantes. Elephas, namque, cujus os est ebur, castum est animal et adeo frigidae naturae, ut super os ejus, id est super ebur posito gracili lineo panno et super pannum posita pruna exstinguatur illaeso panno. Et os continuum claudit corpus ejus, inde dicitur invulnerabile. Significat autem sanctos et castos, a telis diaboli invulnerabiles." The essence of both mediaeval and classi- cal traditions lives on in Butler's verse: The docile and ingenuous elephant T(o) his own and only female is gallant; And she as true and constant to his bed, That first enjoy'd her single maidenhead. (Miscellaneous Thoughts, I, 379) 94. "Nec adulteria novere . . .," Pliny, op. cit., lib. viii, chap. v. Sigismondo, after the death of his second wife, legalized his relation with Isotta. 95. An official account of these particular celebrations is not known to me. My source is Filippo Picinelli's Mondo simbolico, 2nd ed. Venice, 1678, sec. 309. This particular way of honoring a saint would only baffle those who are unfamiliar with the as- tounding range of legitimate Renaissance allegory. A certain ex- travaganza seems to have marked some of the impromptu festivi- ties; cf. Gio. Pietro Giussano, Vita di S. Carlo Borromeo . .., Rome, 1679, PP. 390 and 4oo. Seneca's letter (Epistulae morales, LXXXV, xli, ed. Loeb, p. 308) reads: ". . . elephantum minimus Aethiops iubet subsidere in genua et ambulare funem. Sic sapiens artifex est domandi mala." Although this passage was well known to the emblematists (cf. e.g., G. C. Capaccio, Delle imprese, Napoli, 1592, lib. II, chap. ix, p. 212), I have nowhere found so much as a hint of Seneca's Stoic application. The tight-rope dancing elephant was considered the piece de resistance of the lowliest circus performances. It was particularly shocking when, in the course of one of Nero's ludi maximi, "a</page><page sequence="24">174 THE ART BULLETIN Bernini may or may not have heard of these and similar interpretations. We can be sure that he had inferred from Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (in the article on Religion) that the elephant might be considered a fitting emblem for a Pope, for "the rare qualities found in that noblest of beasts are worthy of honors higher than those of Cardinaldom" (Fig. 34).9" Bernini's contemporary eulogists naturally viewed the elephant of the Minerva in the light of this tradition. An anonymous poet tells us that the three main components of the monument: elephant, obelisk, and Chigi stars, sym- bolize "the Pontiff's might spread over the Earth, which shows to the pious the path to the highest stars."" The papal insignia, the mountain range topped by the star, re- quire no further explanation. The obvious heaven-pointing function of the obelisk we shall discuss more fully in the third section. I have no doubt that the poet wishes us to see the elephant as also partaking in the act of guidance. Pliny describes how the elephant will courteously show the stray wanderer the way out of the jungle,98 in one of those "silly- sooth" stories that so much appealed to the mediaeval mind,"99 and which, finally, turn up again in Renaissance emblematics, where, in the baroque period, the guiding ele- phant becomes, as DUX OBERRANTI, a symbol of Christ, "who, by his example, shows the path to eternal Salvation."'oo I shall discuss the inscriptions on the plinth of the Mi- nerva monument in the last section at greater length. Relevant here is a passage of the dedication that offers the "moral" that "one should be of a mind as robust as the ele- phant, the strongest of beasts." Reference to the elephant's robustness is baffling only as long as we see it exclusively as a physical quality. Pliny follows Aristotle, and in general expresses a tenet common in antiquity, when he claims that elephants, "the strongest of beasts, are nearest to man in intelligence." Hardly a mediaeval passage dealing with elephants fails to repeat this statement, mostly on the au- thorities of Isidore of Seville or the Physiologus.1o? well-known Roman knight mounted an elephant and rode down a rope"; Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars, lib. vi, chap. xi (ed. Loeb, I, p. o103). For other accounts cf. Ludwig Friedlinder, Darstel- lungen aus der Sittengeschichte Roms . . ., ioth ed. Leipzig, 1923, p. 87 and note 16. Curiously the Senecan idea of achieving the all but impossible has been revived in a modern cartoon, Rollin Kirby's "Republican Elephant," The New York Times Magazine, January 5, 1947, P- 7 (Fig. 33)- 96. Iconologia, Rome, 1603, p. 431 (ed. Siena, 1613, p. i88). The Cardinal is shown to represent a goodly number of elephantine virtues - "Religione, Prudenza, Giustitia, &amp; Mansuetudine." Ripa's passage may be complemented by one in Tasso's "I1 Conte" (Dialoghi, ed. C. Guasti, Florence, 1859, III, p. 404) ; in front of the Obelisk of Sixtus V the young noble speaks of "l'elefante, il quale di religione, come si scrive, supera tutti gli altri [viz. animali]," ranking him highest among the legitimate imprese taken from animals. 97. (Haec est) Pontificis diffusa potentia in Orbem Quae suprema pijs pandit ad astra viam; printed as "Analogia hieroglyphicarum obelisci ad Alexandrum VII. Pont. Max. comparata," No. II, prefixed to A. Kircher's Inter- pretatio. 98. Naturalis historia, lib. viii, chap. v, and, as usual, slightly expanded in Solinus' Polyhistor, chap. xxv (ed. Th. Mommsen, Berlin, 1895, pp. iii f.): ". . . si per deserta vagabundum hominem forte viderint, ductus usque ad notas vias praebent." 99. The straight ethical tenor of the story made it unfit for "moraliter" treatment; it is not found in the bestiaries. Alexander Neckam cites Solinus as his authority and excerpts the passage quoted in the preceding note almost word for word (De naturis rerum, lib. II, chap. cxliv, p. 225). The mediaeval authority par excellence, both for the Continent and for England in the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries, Bartholomaeus Anglicus ("de Glanvilla") again slightly expanded the account: ". . . Si ele- phantes hominem errantem sibi obuius viderint in solitudine, primo ne impetu terreant, aliquantulum de via se subtrahunt et tune gradualiter vigunt et paulatim ipsum praecedentes viam ei osten- dunt." For Bartholomew's importance to the Renaissance writers, cf. Ch.-V. Langlois, La Connaissance de la nature et du monde au moyen age . . ., Paris, 1911, pp. 126 ff. The names of Ripa and Pierio might be added to Langlois' list; they quote Bartholomew, without, however, always accepting him as an authority. See note io6. ioo. F. Picinelli (op. cit., sec. 326) seems to have condensed Bartholomew's account. But he adds that like Christ, the elephant "monstra al suo esempio la strada dell' eterna salute." Cesare Ripa, speaking of the mighty elephant as "Animale, ch'habbia forza di nocere, &amp; non voglia, ma piu tosto di giouare . . .," uses the story as an example to the mighty on earth, who should come to the assistance of those who are in dire need; cf. Iconologia, Siena, I613, p. 79 (sub "Benignita"). The elephant as Christ occurs in the early fourteenth century in the Gesta Romanorum. The under- lying story is a thirteenth-century "apocrypha" in which the uni- corn hunt has been expanded and transferred upon the elephant: two naked Maidens, one with a sword (Eve burdened by sin), one with a vessel (Mary and her uterus -irgineus) with their wiles trick and overpower the Elephant (Christus verus) who is un- able to resist their naked breasts (the Old and New Testament) and their sweet singing; chap. cxv (cvii), "De morte Christi pro nostra reconciliacione," ed.

I should like to quote in illus- tration of their particular attitude, which amounts to some- thing of a "philosophy," two significant voices, both of about the middle of the sixteenth century: that of a scien- tist and that of a poet. Girolamo Cardano, the ardent admirer of Vesalius and his teaching, was also a speculative thinker of great force. He had an opportunity to study the behavior of the thir- teen-year-old elephant whom Mary of Bohemia, the daughter of Charles V, brought back to Vienna from Spain (1552). Cardano came to the conclusion that "the ele- phant seems to fall short of man in no manner, except for his lack of speech."102 He then advanced a peculiar theory of the animal's wisdom, deduced from longevity: "Wis- dom surely derives from the temperament, it can be prog- nosticated and ascertained by knowing the length of life. Hence it is that old men are wiser and also those who are born to them. No short-lived animal can be very wise. Hence it is that the wisest animals are the Camel, the Ele- phant, and Man."'13 Giovanni Battista Gelli wrote a series of dramatic dia- logues under the title Circe. In these dialogues a number of Ulysses' companions whom Circe had transformed into animals of varying intellectual standing discourse on the relative advantage of remaining a beast. In dialogue after dialogue, the Oyster, Mole, Lion, Horse, Dog, etc. turn down Circe's offer to let them assume human guise once more - with one notable exception, the elephant who, it is hardly necessary to add, had been in his previous existence an Athenian philosopher."'4 Apart from being strong and wise the elephant was capable of religious notions. On the threshold of the Renais- sance, Sannazaro poeticized an often-quoted passage from Pliny. In celebration of a new moon the elephants "go down to a river named Amilo and there perform a ritual of purification, sprinkling themselves with water, and after paying thus their respects to the moon return to the woods carrying before them those of their calves who are tired ." In the Arcadia we read: Dimmi, qual fera e si di mente umana, che s'inginocchia al raggio de la luna, e per purgarsi scende a la fontana? 105 These lines were famous; they were given prominence by Cesare Ripa and other authorities on iconology. In sum- ming up we may say that the elephant of the Renaissance is strong and wise and that his wisdom is tempered on the one hand by Meekness and on the other by Religiosity.106 Not all the traits that constituted the moral character of the elephant came direct from the regions of higher cul- ture. Some existed already in nuce in the popular litera- tures of late-mediaeval astrology, minne-addresses and proverbial dicta, seeds undoubtedly sown by the schoolman and the preacher. In a fifteenth-century representation of "Scorpio," a man riding on an elephant ("vir sedens in elephante") is prognosticated as follows: "Homo fortis erit et stabilis" (Fig. 35))."1 The same idea of strength tem- p. 59): "Elefantes vero iuxta sensuin humanum intellectus ha- bent . . ." Albertus Magnus, the first great heir to Aristotle's empirical method, makes his statement by far more cautious: "Ali- quid intellectui simile videtur habere," and "habet autem bonum sensum valde in hiis quae videt et audit ad instructionem pertinen- tia; in hiis enim est melior omnibus animalibus . . ." De animali- bus, lib. viii, tract. 5, chap. ii, par. zo208 (ed. H. Stadler, Munster, 1916, I, p. 658). Io2. Cardano, De subtilitate, lib. x, p. 306. For interesting de- tails on the elephant Cardano examined cf. the chapter "Der erste Elephant in Wien," in Moriz Bermann, Alt- und Neu-Wien . Vienna, 1880, II, pp. 701-706. There was, however, an opinion that credited the elephant even with the faculty of intelligible speech: "It is said that Elephants talk to one another, mumbling with their mouths the speech of men . . .," Oppian, Cynegetica, lib. r, 11. 540 ff. (ed. Loeb, p. 103); quoted by Tasso in his Dialogue, "Il Conte," ed. C. Guasti, Florence, 1859, III. The great philologist Justus Lipsius (1547-1606) deals with the ele- phant's capacity of speech at length. He refers to Christophoro Acosta's account, who testifies that in Cochin he heard an elephant say: " 'Ho6 boo': quod Malabarum lingua est, 'Volo, volo!' " Lipsius concludes: ". . . non dicam, an hominem capiant, sed ad hominem immo supra hominem sapiant elephantes"i Epistola de elephantis, printed in J. Chr. Petri von Hartenfels, Elephanto- graphia curiosa, Leipzig and Erfurt, 1723 (appendix, pp. 13 ff.). 103. Ibid., p. 313. Io4. Gelli's once popular Circe ( 548) was first brought to my att6ntion through George Boas' interesting study The Happy Beast . . ., Baltimore, 1933, pp. 28-36. There exist a number of English translations, the earliest Circes, London, I557, another as late as 1744 (by H. Layng, London). An amusing comparison of the elephant with the typical scholar is found in Conrad von Megenberg's Buch der Natur, ed. prima, Augsburg, 1475, fol. 84 verso: "Er wechsst vierczig iar darnach enpfindet er frostes des wijnters vnd des kalten windes. Des magst du geleichen den gelerten leiiten." 105. Ed. E. Carrara, Torino, 1926, p. 89, 11. 1-3. The pious elephant as part of a nocturnal genre-scene appears in the frescoes by Taddeo Zuccaro for the Farnese palace at Caprarola; cf. Anni- bale Caro's letter to Taddeo (ed. Lettere scelte, E. Marcucci, Flor- ence, 1889, pp. 198 ff.) in which he suggests: to fill a frieze with a night-scene and "cose proporzionate alla Luna": fishermen at night who steer by the magnetic compass, necromancers, witches, and the like, and by way of "grotesche," various types of nets with a few fish in them that have been caught, and crabs grazing in the light of the moon. Should there be sufficient space, a kneeling elephant, worshipping the moon ("e se il loco n'e capace, un ele- fante inginiocchioni che l'adorasse"). io6. Ripa speaks up for the elephant against the great authority of Bartholomaeus Anglicus (see note 99) who (op. cit., lib. xviII, chap. xlii) had called the elephant "benign" because he was lack- ing in falsehood. Such a thing, Ripa claims, might be said of the camel, but the elephant is benign because "nature has equipped him with a certain light of prudent intellect and quasi-human senti- ment," for which latter statement he cites Pliny; cf. op. cit., Siena, 1613, sub "Benignit'a." This same notion is the key-note still in David Ferrand's Discours apologetic, both in the dedicatory son- net ("un animal si grand, si sage &amp; si prudent") and in the very opening sentence of the discourse itself. 107. Johannes Angelus, Astrolabium planum, Augsburg, 1488; quoted by F. Saxl, "Verzeichnis astrologischer und mythologischer</page><page sequence="26">176 THE ART BULLETIN pered by probity is inscribed on a Minnekiistchen of about 14oo, beside the representation of an elephant carrying one of the elaborate Wasserschlisser of the Rhineland; this time it is the lover who speaks: "mi kraf ? niat truig" ("my strength does not deceive")."'s In fourteenth-century England there existed the dictum: "Virtue makes a man strong as an elephant."109 We cannot tell whether it is the humanistic revival, or a re-ennoblement of such popular conceits that would ac- count for Matteo de' Pasti's representation of "Fortitudo" on the reverse of a portrait medal of Sigismondo Malatesta of 1446. "Fortitudo" is represented as a lady in armor. With both hands she holds the broken shaft of a column, "recumbens super ellephantes," that is on a sedes, not un- like that of the astrological elephant rider, which here is formed, a little more elegantly, of the fore-parts of two elephants turned outwards.110 Finally mention must be made of Horapollo Nilous; for his Hieroglyphica eclipsed all other authorities. Pedestrian though it may appear to us, it had held spell-bound the Italian humanists and antiquarians since its discovery in the early fifteenth century until far into the seventeenth.1' Hieroglyph 84 of the second part goes under the title, "How the ancient Egyptians represented a strong man [robustum hominem - the word "robustus" with refer- ence to the elephant occurs in the inscription of the Mi- nerva monument] and one who smells out what things are useful to him." It reads: "When they wanted to symbolize a man powerful in body and mind, they depicted an ele- phant with his trunk. With the latter he scents and goes after things that are essential."112 The so-called Horapollo was in everyone's hands. His influence on Bernini and those who helped in drafting the program of the monument of the Minerva must have been doubly assured by the fact that Cesare Ripa quoted this Hieroglyph on the elephant in his own article on "Forza."113 To Bernini's contemporaries in the ultimate analysis the elephant is not so much an allegory of strength alone as one of strength guided by wisdom. It is, therefore, not as fabri- cations of poetic license but as expressions in the wake of an age-old tradition that the contemporary poets keep stress- ing the spiritual and intellectual side of Bernini's elephant who carries the obelisk.114 We may feel tempted to ask how it happened that with Bernini's monument the eighteen-hundred-year-old idea of the elephant as a caryatid and as a moral allegory had found perhaps its greatest but also its last relevant expres- sion in the West.115 The answer, as I see it, lies in a funda- illustrierter Handschriften des lateinischen Mittelalters," part II s.t.

Abhandlung, 1927, p. 54, fig. 27. The popular praise of the elephant's savage strength goes back to Indian legend. In art Indra is represented riding. on his elephant who uproots a tree; for a second-century relief with this scene cf. Otto Fischer, Die Kunst Indiens . . ., Berlin, 1928, fig. 147. Ktesias gives the first eye-witness account of elephants and stresses this point: he may well have been shown such repre- sentations. Further material on this theme: Pauly-Wissowa, Real- Encyclopiidie, v, col. 2249, s.v. "Elefant." The animal's brute force was commented upon throughout the Middle Ages, as in the description of Eleazar's fight (Speculum hurmanae salvationis, chap. xxix), "fortis impegit in fortem . . ." and down to Mijnheer Sevender's elephant: about 1627 he was said to have thrown, in order to end a dispute of precedence, a carriage and its team of five horses over a bridge at Rochester into the River Medway. io8.

Discovered as early as the second decade of the fifteenth century, the Greek editio prima appeared only in i505; soon after numerous translations followed, both in Latin and the vernacu- lars; George Boas is preparing a critical edition of the Horapollo; the best investigation of sources and possible origin is found in Max Wellmann's article "Der Physiologus . . .," Philologus (Supplementband), xxII, 1930, pp. 60-64; for its role in the Renaissance, cf. Karl Giehlow, "Die Hieroglyphenkunde des Hu- manismus in der Allegorie der Renaissance," Jahrbuch der kunst- historischen Sammlungen des allerh6chsten Kaiser/auses, xxxII, 1915, pp. 218 ff. The first author to cast serious doubt (if not justified in all points) on the Hieroglyphica is, to my knowledge, Gisbert Cuperus (De elep/antis in nummis obviis . . ., The Hague, 1719, chap. iii): "ad veterem aetatem non sunt referenda Hiero- glyphica Horapollinis"; and "Nullus Elephas inter litteras Hiero- glyphicas." 112. For Pierio Valeriano's version, cf. ed. Frankfort, 1678, p. i9; see also following note. I 3. Ripa quotes the Horapollo via Pierio's Hieroglyphica which, after all, was the great "Summa" and synthesis for all that had passed as rebus etc. up to the mid-sixteenth century. I I4. These lines are quoted from three different poems in A. Kircher's Interpretatio, Rome, 1666: "Bellua, quae molem gestat, &amp; ipsa sapit"; "Prudentior Elephante nulla est Bellua"; "In Mineruae Forum / Es prudens Elephas: Mineruae prudens, Foro quam bene praesidetis ambo?" I15. In Catania, Sicily, a huge, late antique (possibly Roman) lava-elephant with white marble tusks carries an octagonal Egyptian obelisk, and stands, as part of a fountain, in the Piazza del Duomo. In its present form, the monument is an eighteenth- century pasticcio (the work of an architect, Giovanni Battista Vac- carini). I mention it only because it has been suggested as Colonna's model on the authority of Giehlow, Volkmann and others. There is, however, no reason and no evidence that Vaccarini did not follow Bernini and Colonna when he composed this fountain out of disjecta membra; Vaccarini's work is in the most primitive of manners. Giehlow himself shows that no seventeenth-century writer knew of the combination of the two elements in Catania; the obelisk, apparently, had done service as an architrave in the Bishop's Palace and was not discovered until I620 (cf. Philippe d'Orville, Sicula, Amsterdam, I764, I, p. xxiii, as quoted by Giehlow, Jahr-</page><page sequence="27">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK 177 mental change in man's attitude toward beasts. The change took place in the course of the seventeenth century. One by one, the legendary and allegorical connotations of mediae- val and post-mediaeval animal-lore receded and paled in favor of two novel approaches to animals, that of zoology and that of sentiment.116 France and the Lowlands were in the vanguard of this new attitude. Mijnheer Sevender taught his elephant to enjoy his pipe of tobacco; and we may say that moral and emblematic interest are lost or about to be abandoned when we hear what Nicolas Claude de Peiresc, the greatest gentleman-archaeologist of his day, the friend and mentor of many great artists, among them Rubens, had to say about the elephant of 1627: I feel quite relieved to learn that the elephant hasn't died after all, but I would feel reassured if I heard that some great naturalist would take it upon himself to examine and observe him frequently and if he would give us a precise description of his "naturel" and if I could come to know whether it is true that the elephant understands his interpreter's "jargon" as easily as they say he does. M. Tavernier should make an en- graving of him, not only of him in full but also of the princi- pal parts of his body severally, and should the elephant die ["s'il se laissoit mourir"], he deserves to pass into the hands of some smart and up-to-date anatomists."17 THE MINERVA OBELISK, DIVINE WISDOM AND ALEXANDER VII We must not lose sight of the obvious, ancillary func- tion of the elephant to act as the support of the Minerva obelisk. Alexander VII erected this obelisk to his own glory, and dedicated it, as we shall see, to "Divine Wisdom." To set up an obelisk in one's own honor seems terribly clear to the modern Freudian mind (Fig. 36),11 although the motivation was much more complicated and, in a sense, richer in former ages. Athanasius Kircher's Interpretatio hieroglyphica of 1666 shows that the erection of an obelisk was considered in Bernini's age as part of applied hiero- glyphics, as much as emblems and coats-of-arms. In this sense obelisks to commemorate outstanding persons"1' had been erected, if often only on paper, in books of imprese (Fig. 37 ).120 Again Ripa's advice may well have animated the planning of the Minerva obelisk, as he suggests that obelisks should be erected in honor of the "chiara, &amp; alta gloria de i Prencipi, che con magnificenza fanno fabriche sontuose, e grandi . . ." (Fig. 38).121 Such was no doubt buch der kunsthistorischen Sammlungen des allerh6chsten Kaiser- hauses, xxxII, 1915, P. 52). The obelisk is described in 1697, with- out mention of the elephant (Giehlow, ibidem). The literary echoes of the Minerva monument hardly ever refer to the whole. Gisbert Cuperus, e.g., excerpts Kircher's Interpretatio and offers a slightly reduced facsimile of Kircher's etching of the monument; cf. op. cit., chap. xi, p. 2425 his authority was not the monument but Kircher; cf. note 6 on p. 156; J. G. Keysler (Travels . . ., znd ed. London, 1752, II, p. 118) offers an English rendering of the dedicatory tablets, and, for the rest, quotes Kircher; G. Zoega in his scholarly De origine et usu obeliscorum . . ., Rome, I797, quotes Kircher's authority and the inscription in Latin. iI6. Cf. George Boas, The Happy Beast, Baltimore, 1933, passim, with further bibliography. As the "moral" elephant's last curtain-call might be described J. Chr.

When he speaks of the elephant's "principaulxs membres '. part," Peiresc has their ears in mind. Most artists made them look too much like huge sea-shells; for the best models Peiresc refers artists to the Roman paintings then circulated in engravings; ibid., pp. '37 ff. The English were astonishingly slow in receiving the new trends from abroad; elephants as well as Noble Savages from Brazil appeared in France as early as the middle of the sixteenth century (cf. note 78), but the sentiment for both the elephant and the Noble Savage, it seems, did not reach England before the 'eighties. Shakespeare, slower even than his countrymen, usually seems to wait for the peak of a fashion the better to be able to take it to task. In The Tempest he explodes the (Montaigne-Florio- Tacitus) myth of the Noble Savage; in Troilus and Cressida he debunks two of the most tenacious moralizing elephantine char- acteristics, that elephants are polite and that they cannot bend their joints: "The Elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy: his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure . . ." (II, ii). The first to appreciate the significance of Shakespeare's remark was Samuel C. Chew, The Crescent and the Rose . . ., p. I9. In England, satire and sightseeing seem to speed the end of the allegorical elephant. We will find the Englishman's non plus ultra either in Thomas Coryate's proud claim: "I have rid vpon an Elephant" (cf. note 45), or in such elaborate satires (a volume could be filled with them) as Samuel Butler's The Elephant in the Moon, ca. 1676, in which he ridicules the extravagant hopes pinned on the telescope, by showing that the mighty elephant whom the assembled members of the Royal Society think they have seen traversing the Moon with powerful strides, is nothing but a mouse (would Butler have had a shrew in mind?) caught between the lenses of their tele- scope 5 cf. also H.

They were accordingly inter- preted as links between earth and heaven; for if one looked at them from base to apex, they would seem to suggest by their evanescence the transition from things terrestrial to incorporeal Divinity itself.123 Even more important, if seen conversely, the obelisks, by their pyramidal shape, might be compared to the pencil of rays issuing from the center of the sun. This latter idea formed part of the tenet - ad- vanced by Greek and Roman writers and repeated by the Egyptologists of the Renaissance - that "through their obelisks the Egyptians imitated the rays of the sun whom they themselves worshipped." No lesser authority than Torquato Tasso had celebrated in quite similar terms Rome's most conspicuous obelisk, the one Pope Sixtus V re-erected in the Piazza of S. Giovanni in Laterano in 1588.124 In the Renaissance philosophy of good government, two most desirable qualities in a ruler had come to the fore: Force and Enlightenment. The aptest symbol for the lat- ter would be the sun. Hence many obelisks, which eager citizens set up to honor their visiting majesty, were topped, in conscious imitation of supposed Egyptian usage, by actual images of the sun (Fig. 39).1' As Kircher reported to Alexander VII, the Minerva obelisk itself was "consecrated by the Egyptians to the high- est genius ('supremo Genio'), whom they called World Spirit or World Soul, and they held that its seat was fixed in the Sun."126 I should like to dwell on this solar concept for a moment by referring to a small Persian heliotrope. The name of the stone is itself significant. The gem shows an elephant under the sign of the sun, a sign crudely repre- London, 1936, III, No. 333, pl. LIII, 5 cf. for similar observations also Pierio Valeriano, Hieroglyphorum collectanea . . ., lib. XLVI, chaps. xxxii and xxxvi, ed. Lyons, 16Io, pp. 530 ff. Whereas the woodcut of Ripa's chapter of "Gloria" shows, in the edition of 1603 (p 190), a woman standing by a brick-pyramid that in shape resembles a somewhat attenuated Cestius pyramid (Fig. 38), we notice in the Siena edition of 1613 (p. 297) a distinct move toward a true obelisk: a stone as yet untruncated, yet suggestive of a monolith, resting on four spherical feet. While the seventeenth- century antiquarians seem to use the term "obeliscus" correctly, as distinct from "pyramis," we find that in emblematic and icono- logical writings (and also in poetry), "pyramis" serves as a com- prehensive term embracing all those structures that are pyramidal in shape. This is nothing but surviving mediaeval usage. Magister Gregorius, for example, who around 1200 treated of both the pyramids and the obelisks of the city of Rome, used the term "piramis" indiscriminately; cf. his Narracio, par. 27-29, ed. and commentary by G. McN. Rushforth, Journal of Roman Studies, IX, 19 19, p. 56 and comment on pp. 42 ff. i22. Cf. Pastor, Geschichte der Piipste, Freiburg, xIv, pt. I, 1929, p. 524, note i.

Ioannes Baptista Casalio's fervent apologia favoring the papal use of obelisks (with an invective against the obelisk- wrecking Goths) : De veteribus Aegyptiorum ritibus, Rome, 1644, chap. iii, pp. 6 ff. A. Kircher referred to the sun rays as "digiti Solis"; cf. quotation infra. In Torquato Tasso's profound dis- cussion, "'ll Conte o vero de l'imprese" (1594) (ed. Dialoghi, C. Guasti, Florence, 1859, III, pp. 365-444), we read (on p. 369) : "Ma questa figura fu giudicata misteriosa da gli Egizi, e simile a quella de' raggi del sole; anzi, con questo nome stesso, cioe raggi del sole, solevano da quella nazione esser nominati, e da' re de l'Egitto al sole furono consacrati, o al figliulo del sole (cosi fur chiamati ne l'etai seguente gli uomini illustri). Ora sono conse- crati a la Croce, ne la quale il Sole intelligibile parve eclissarsi per interposizione de la sua umaniti . . ." Naturally everyone in Rome was familiar with Emperor Augustus' inscriptions on the obelisks of Piazzas Colonna and del Popolo: AEGYPTO IN POTESTATEM POPVLI ROMANI REDACTA, SOLI DONVM DEDIT5 mentioned, among others, in Kircher's survey of "obelisk-erecters," in which seven Egyptian kings, seven Caesars, and four Popes (including Alexander VII) are enumerated. It has been pointed out that while classical authors stress the solar impli- cation of the obelisks, Egyptian texts are much less vocal; cf. W. H. Roscher, Ausfilhrliches Lexikon . . ., Leipzig, 1884-, Iv, cols. i 6o ff. (s.v. "Sonne und Sonnengott"). But the sun-disk which the Egyptians placed on top of some obelisks and the gold- plating on some of the obelisk-pyramidions ("so that they might catch the first rays of the sun") would corroborate the idea - ex- pressly stated in classical writers - that the Egyptians themselves were thinking of the obelisks as typifying "rays of the sun." Our obelisk bears a hieroglyphic dedication to Pharaoh Hophra (Haa-ib-ra, 588-568 B.c., XXVI Dynasty), hailing him as a "giver of life on earth as the sun is in eternity"5 cf. Orazio Maruc- chi, Gli obelischi Egiziani di Roma . . ., Rome, 1898, pp. Ii5- izo, where the hieroglyphs are transcribed in full. This idea of divine lactimellifluence was distinctly in Athanasius Kircher's mind when he wrote (op. cit., "Argumentum") : "Vt itaque hunc Genium apto symbolo exprimerunt, Obelisci figuram maxime congruam eligebant, quaternis lateribus in vltimum punctum fastigiatum, quas figuras Aegyptiace digitos Solis dicebant, vt proinde apte per huiusmodi Obeliscorum fastigiatas moles significarent, spiritus Mundi, sive Genij Solaris in quadripartitas Mundi partes, in- fluxum; quo cuncta animari, cuncta conseruari, praeterea abun- dantiam &amp; vbertatem rerum omnium ad vitam necessariarum con- cedi credebant." 125. An interesting chapter indeed in the genesis and evolu- tion of the modern "roi-soleil" concept! The sun as a princely emblem was by no means rare in the sixteenth century. Cf. e.g. Torquato Tasso (op. cit., pp. 395 ff.) who mentions, among others, Emperor Maximilian, Philip of Spain and Cardinal Montalto. The concept, which in Louis XIV could not have failed to provoke Alexander VII, had had its distinct pre-stages in the fetes: (i) An obelisk which greeted Henri IV as "Hercvles Gallicvs" on his entrie at Rouen, 1596, illustrated the idea by means of a sun-image that was placed on its pyramidion j cf. Sociedt rouennaise de biblio- philes, xxvii, No. 37, 1887, fig. on p. 53 (Fig. 39) ; (ii) Louis XIII entered Lyon in the year 1622 (December 1i) and the event was recorded in a book under a title that in itself contained a significant pun: Le Soleil au Signe du Lyon (Lyon, 1623). See also the observations in Mario Praz, Studies in Seventeenth-Century Imagery, I, London, 1939, p. 162 ff. 126. Athanasius Kircher, op. cit., in a passage that immediately precedes our quotation in note 124: "Est Obeliscus hic ab Aegyptijs consecratus supremo Genio, quem Spiritum seu Animam Mundi dicebant, in Sole sedem suam fixisse credebant . . ."</page><page sequence="29">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK 179 sented by three fingers pointing downwards (Fig. 40).127 The idea of the sun-worshipping elephant is by no means uncommon. Aelian and others tell us "that elephants will greet the rising sun by raising their trunks like hands towards the sun rays and that therefore they are beloved of the God."18 Alexander the Great, when he dedicated his favorite elephant to the Sun,'29 only followed established Eastern tradition. No documentary evidence tells us whether Alexander VII was aware of the parallel in his procedure to that of his admired namesake. The contrap- posto-position of the elephant's head, in particular the point- ing upward-sweep of the animal's lithe trunk in the di- rection of obelisk, Chigi mountains, star and Cross may well be a gesture of homage on the part of the elephant quite in keeping with Aelian's words."13 The elephant under a sun- symbol, then, appears both in Persia and in Italy. In spite of its provincialism in form and execution the little Persian cameo shows - as if in illustration of Mnemosyne's reach - how the same basic idea, the idea of Sun-worship, may occur quite independently in second-century Asia and in seventeenth-century Italy, producing in either case icono- graphic configurations of fundamental similarity. Obelisks had to be exorcized before they could be erected "under the Cross."'3 This by no means cleansed them of memories of previous idolatrous functions. On the contrary, the very persistence of those memories links the obelisks with that particular wisdom of the Egyptian priests, which Kircher had in mind when he said they were dedicated to the "World Spirit." The first rays of the Divine Wisdom that is "older than the hills" had shone on the obelisks.132 For Divine Wisdom, according to Solomon's Proverbs, "infuses itself into the holy souls per nationes,"133 which means that Divine Wisdom, ever-present since God created the World, reaches Christianity by way of the people who lived before Salvation came to mankind. We find this idea in the dedicatory tablet of the monu- ment (facing west), which reads in translation: In the year of Salvation 1667 Alexander VII dedicated to Di- vine Wisdom the ancient Obelisk; sacred to the Egyptian Pallas, this monument was wrested from the earth so that it might be erected in Minerva's Piazza which now belongs to the Theotokos.134 127. Cf. Imhoof-Blumer and Keller, Tier- und Pflanzenbilder auf Miinzen und Geminen des klassischen Altertuins, Leipzig- Berlin, 1889, pl. xix, No. 37. Adolf Furtwdingler (Kgl. Museen zu Berlin, Beschreibung der geschnittenen Steine imt Antiquarium, Berlin, 1896, No. 8704) dates the stone "spitere Kaiserzeit." A few words might be said about sun and sun-emanations under the sign of a triangle. The Sun is referred to as tripdd ("three- footed") in Hindu and Persian terminology; cf. Hastings, En- cyclopaedia, xII, p. 83, s.v. "Sun." In Christian art we may expect to find the triangular nimb for the Holy Trinity. The few tri- angular nimbs listed in the Princeton Index of Christian Art (prior to 1400) are all doubtful. Dr. Panofsky drew my attention to what may well be the earliest instance, in a North Italian representation of the Annunciation, early fifteenth century (Metropolitan Mu- seum, New York; cf. A Catalogue of Italian . . . Paintings, New York, 1940, p. I02, No. 32.100.96), in which God is desig- nated by a triangular nimb as representing the Holy Trinity. The triangular nimb then becomes a very frequent attribute, particu- larly in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century art, possibly under the additional influence of hieroglyphics; cf., for a late example, Johann Ulrich Krauss' picture Bible, s.t. Heilige Augen- und Gemueths-Lust . . ., Augsburg, 1706, pt. I I, p. 79; God the Father appears with a triangular nimb, a pyramidal shaft of light issues from his breast and in it the Dove of the Holy Spirit (Dr. H. Jantz of Princeton drew my attention to the copy of this book in his private collection). 128. Aelian (op. cit., lib. vii, chap. xliv, ed. P. Gillius and C. Gesner, s.l., 1591, P. 458) is the most likely source for the transmission of this classical concept to the Renaissance. He may have drawn on Plutarch's (Moralia, "De sollertia animalium," chap. xvii, ed. and translation D. Wyttenbach, Oxford, 1797, pp. 943 ff., who in turn quotes from Juba) : "Scribit etiam ele- phantos Diis vota facere, cum se, nemine docente, mari [in Pliny it is rivers] lustrent, Solemque orientem adorent, proboscide manus loco sursum erecta." For further classical passages linking the elephant with sun-worship, cf. Pauly-Wissowa, op. cit., v, cols. 2252 ff. (but note that of the authorities cited, Pliny and Cassius Dio refer to the elephant worshipping the moon). Mediaeval bestiaries do not mention this tradition but we find it again in the "school books" in close sequence to classical authority: "Solis exortus motibus quibus possunt salutant" (Alexander Neckam, De naturis rerum, lib. ii, chap. cxliv, ed. Rolls Series, p. 224). Bru- netto Latini, Il tesoro di Brunetto Latini, volgarizzato da Bono Giamboni . .., II, p. 248: "E sappiete, che nel leofante e grande senno, ch' elli osservano la disciplina del sole e della luna, si come fanno gli uomini." This Conrad Gesner paraphrases in the Thier- buch (translated from the original Latin by C. Forer), Zurich, 1563, fol. LXXVI verso: "Die Helffanten vereerend die Gestirn Sonn vnd Mon / dann so die Sonn aufgadt / So kerend sy sich gagen der Sonnen / hebend jre nasen Eiber sich / als ob sy mit der selbigen anstatt der hinden / die Sonnen anba~ttind." 129. Cf. note z2. I30. The idea, by no means undignified, of the elephant's trumpeting (his "barrus") may in addition be implied in this gesture. 13 1.

At first Divine Wisdom was incarnate in the Egyptian Isis, then in the Graeco-Roman Minerva, and ultimately, in its purest exponent, the Mother of the Lord Herself, in the words of St. Bernard, the "miranda et profundissima di- spensatrix sapientiae."135 Divine Wisdom, particularly as it is incarnate in the Vir- gin Mary, has yet another aspect: that of Enlightenment. Divine Wisdom in the words of Solomon was nothing but "the radiance of eternal light," and as such it became the legitimate link between pagan and Christian ideas. Its super-solar radiance, expressed by the obelisks' pyramidal appearance, a radiance "more brilliant than that of the sun," could also be seen as "embodied in the Virgin Mary and thus diffused in the Universal Church."136 The relation and interrelation among elephant, obelisk, and Piazza now assumes significance. It remains to study Pope Alexander's share in the program. The inscription on the monument (facing east) reads: Let every beholder of the images, engraven by the wise Egyp- tian and carried by the elephant - the strongest of beasts - reflect this lesson: Be of strong mind ["robustae mentis"], uphold solid Wisdom.137 It is not difficult to read the message of eulogy between the lines, alluding to the Pope's "robust mind," which lived in such a feeble body and which, as we know, was so ar- dently devoted to the pursuit of the arcana of Egyptian wisdom. Bernini, in the third of his original drawings in the Chigiana, had suggested a figure of Hercules as the car- rier of the Minerva obelisk. Such representation of overt Robustness and Wisdom combined, suggesting antitheses tempering one another, would have been in keeping with the customary "advice to the worldly ruler." In 1654 Queen Christine of Sweden had brought with her to Rome a painting by Veronese. It showed Divine Wisdom as "una donna quasi ignuda," her inspired glance directed at a minute sun-image ("simbolo della sapienza")138 hovering above her, and by her side Hercules as an obvious allegory of the Strength of the ruler (Fig. 41). We can readily understand that Pope Alexander, choosing between the elephant and Hercules as carriers of the Minerva obelisk decided in favor of the beast and its additional association with the spiritual qualities that Hercules decidedly lacked.139 nection with the rehabilitation of the University whose name, "Sapienza," crystallized at this time and was celebrated by a medal inscribed: OMNIS SAPIENTIA A DOMINO; cf. Pastor, op. cit., XIV, p. 521 and note I. 135. The words occur in the sub-title of St. Bernard of Clair- vaux' Ad laudem gloriosae V. Matris (Patrologia Latina, CLXXXII). When Sixtus V "purged" the Capitol of heathen images, he de- creed that only a statue of Minerva might remain, after her spear had been turned into a cross-staff; cf. Pastor, op. cit., x, p. 451 and note 6. 136. E. Panofsky, What Is Iconology? MS read in December 1946, which the author was kind enough to permit me to quote; reference is made to Jan van Eyck's symbolic treatment of the Virgin "in the church and as the Church." For the solar implica- tions of Divina Sapientia, cf. F. J. D6lger, Antike und Christen- tum, I, Heft 4, Miinster, 1929, p. 271 ("Sonne und Sonnenstrahl als Gleichnis"). For the Mother of the Lord who may be alluded to in terms of the light-mystery of Divina Sapientia, cf. also Mil- lard Meiss, "Light as Form and Symbol in Some Fifteenth-Cen- tury Paintings," THE ART BULLETIN, XXVII, 1945, pp. 175-181. The idea was popular enough in the seventeenth century to father a remarkable book: loannes de Leenheer, V I MARIA G Mystica sub sOlis imagine emblematice expressa (Brussels?), 168x. 137. Cf. note 134. 138. Thus described in 1689; cf. Detlev von Hadeln, "Paint- ings by Veronese from the Collection of Rudolf the Second," Art in America, I, 1913, p. 238. Such an advice in the guise of a por- trait moralise (to borrow a term introduced by H. W. Janson) occurs on a medal (dated 1603) which shows the Dauphin between Henri IV (as Mars) and Maria de' Medici (as Minerva); repro- duced by O. G. von Simson, Zur Genealogie der weltlichen Apo- theosen im Barock . .., (Diss. Munich), Strassburg, I936, pl. 4. It is amusing to reflect that Alexander VII was the author of an unpublished treatise "Che cosa sia piui riguardevole nel cavaliere, il valor o la prudenza" cf. Pastor, op. cit., xIv, pt. I, p. 494, note i. 139. For Veronese's picture, now in New York, cf. Handbook of the Frick Collection, New York, 1947, and von Hadeln, op. cit. Veronese's manner of representing Divine Wisdom was sanctioned by Cesare Ripa when he demanded (Iconologia, ed. Rome, 1603, p. 442) that "Sapienza Vera" be represented as "una Donna quasi ignuda, . .. il viso in alto, mirando vna luce, che gli soprasta; hauera i piedi eleuati da terra, mostrando essere assorta in Dio, &amp; spogliata delle cose terrene" (Veronese's Allegory has her foot on a globe5 the "cose terrene" - regalia with the added inscription OMNIA VANITAS --lie scattered at her feet). Ripa-trained Ben Jonson (as part of "King James's Entertainment," following the figure of "Monarchia Brittanica") designed: "Theosophia or Di- vine Wisdom all in white . . . She was always looking up . . . Her word, PER ME REGES REGNANT, intimating, how by her all kings do govern, . . .to which end was her place upon a cube, at the foot of the monarchy, as her base and stay" (cf. Prov. 8:14 ff.: "Mea est prudentia, mea est fortitudo, per me reges reg- nant"); cf. Masques and Entertainments, ed. Henry Morley, Lon- don, 1890, pp. 378 ff. Hercules was himself related to the Sun; the Twelve Labors would be interpreted as the twelve houses of the Zodiac through which the Sun progresses. I believe that this solar idea stands be- hind the obelisk erected for the entree of Henri IV into Lyon: its face was adorned with representations of nine Labors and Henri, as we have seen, was celebrated as "Hercvles Gallicvs" l cf note 125, p. 178 and Fig. 39. Had Alexander VII accepted Bernini's Hercules as the carrier of the obelisk, he would have eliminated the idea of an impresa proper, inasmuch as from strict emblematics the hu- man form is barred; cf. Erna Mandowski, Untersuchungen zur Iconologie des Cesare Ripa (Diss.), Hamburg, 1934, p. 37 and note 61. It might be rewarding to trace back the baroque "advice to the ruler" to its Byzantine antecedents, "Dynamis" and "Sophia."</page><page sequence="31">BERNINI'S ELEPHANT AND OBELISK 181 By filtering out the overtones of straight adulation, we have in the following lines from a contemporary eulogy the direct link between Alexander VII on the one hand, and the obelisk and Divine Wisdom (as it was incarnate in Solomon) on the other: The Egyptian obelisk, symbol of the rays of Sol, is brought by the elephant to the Seventh Alexander as a gift. Is not the animal wise? Wisdom hath given to the World solely thee, O Seventh Alexander, consequently thou hast the gifts of Sol.140 Thus the circle of dedication returns to its beginning and rests in Alexander VII."14 Pope Alexander's life was spent in an obvious effort to bridge inner conflicts and inconsistencies of character, which he shared with most great men of his time. He was profoundly religious but at the same time erudite in a dis- tinctly secular sense;142 almost morbidly austere"14 but quite capable of penning tender notes to young ladies;144 weighted down by ill-health'" yet of a robust and well- disciplined mind. At the beginning of his papal career he adamantly refused the conventional trionfo by which his predecessors in office had celebrated their election,'46 while at the end of his life and career, he allowed his intimate circle of enlightened scholars and poets4"' to celebrate him by Bernini's monument. It was expressly designed as an allegorical trionfo,14s setting forth "con abbondanza senza 140. Poem, s.t. "Elephas Obelisci Gestator, I" (Kircher's Inter- pretatio) : Quae Solis referunt radios, Aegyptia saxa Septimo ALEXANDRO munera fert elephas. Bellua quam sapiens? Mundo SAPIENTIA solem Septime TE dedit, hinc munera Solis habes. "Sol hominum" was, incidentally, a mystical interpretation of "Solomon" not uncommon in medieval times; cf. Walter Map, De nugis curialium, ed. and trans. F. Tupper and M. B. Ogle, London, 1924, p. i86, 1. 6 and note. 141. The Piazza Minerva monument, then, glorifies both Pope Alexander and (as Athanasius Kircher had pointed out) highest Genius. By token of this programmatic idea (in which allegory appears despoiled of all anthropomorphic paraphernalia) our monument seems to anticipate a later type of memorial: the eight- eenth-century "Monument dedicated to Genius." It has been said with reference to the newer programmatic philosophy (initiated by men like Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Herder) that "in suggesting that the honour of a monument should be extended to all men of genius [it was] implied that the purpose of erecting a memorial was not only to commemorate the achievement of an individual man, but also to remind and incite posterity to worship in him the universal powers of Nature"; cf. Alfred Neumeyer, "Monuments to Genius .. . ," WRarburg Journal, II, 1938, pp. 159 ff. With in- significant changes, this might be the program of our monu- ment! I think that that is more than accidental, and that it is quite possible to see in the Piazza Minerva obelisk this particular type of monument in statu nascendi, as it emanates from the subsoil of emblematic conceits. The eighteenth-century memorials indeed make ample use of pyramids and obelisks (as symbols of eternity) cf. op. cit., pls. 28 and 29. The type of emblematic antecedent to the Minerva monument in turn would be represented, for example by a "heroic memorial on paper," as the one dedicated to one Ugo Peplo (a youth who perished in the Neapolitan war), in Achille Bocchi, Symbolicarum quaestionum . .. libri v, Bononiae, i574, lib. II, Symb. XLVIII, pp. ciiii ff. The engraving, titled RESURGIT EX VIRTUTE VERA GLORIA, shows a meditative figure lean- ing on the shaft of a broken column in contemplation of an obelisk crowned by a sphere (Fig. 37). Two epigrams on plinth and obelisk respectively read: (A) Nescia fortunae virtus cessisse, subactis Sensibus, excelso vertice summa petit. (B) Heroi merito sedes quadrata dicatur, Rectus enim semper constitit ille sibi. 142. The newly elected Pope had a coffin put into his bedroom, by way of memento mori; cf. Pastor, op. cit., xiv, part I, p. 313. 143. Alexander waited a full year (and not without having left the final decision in the hands of a consistory of cardinals) before he admitted his relatives to his entourage; cf. Pastor, op. cit., pp. 316 ff. He refused splendid gifts such as "a bed of Damask imbroidered with gold," from Donna Olympia5 cf. the anon. Life of the Present Pope ALEXANDER the Seventh, London, I66o, p. I70 (translated from the Italian). 144. Among the spirited "carmina extemporalia" which, as Fabio Chigi, he used to write on his many journeys, "recreandi animi gratia," or for special occasions, we find among the former a distych, accompanying a floral gift for "Lydia." Among the latter a long poem introducing to a young girl a black cat with snow-white marks on paws and nose, which he sent her in a little basket, asking her to favor it with her affections; cf. Philomati, Musae iuveniles, Cologne, 1645, Nos. LX (p. ioo) and LXVIII (pp. I I7 ff.). "Philomatus" was Fabio Chigi's name as a mem- ber of the Siena Academy, a membership which, incidentally, he shared with Cesare Ripa; cf. E. Mandowski, op. cit., pp. 52 ff. 145. The Pope never enjoyed stable health; he was plagued by kidney trouble and was in general hyper-sensitive to any extremes of climate, yet his strong mind would triumph over the frailties of his body; cf. Pastor, op. cit., pp. 310 ff. and 326. 146. Pastor, op. cit., pp. 313 ff. 147. Pastor, op. cit., p. 494. 148. The Pope had reason to be interested in obelisks and pyra- mids. Dr. Panofsky drew my attention to the fact that the earliest obelisk to be erected in the course of the Italian Renaissance as a personal memorial was the sepulchral "pyramid" that Rafael de- signed for Agostino Chigi's chapel in Sta. Maria del Popolo; cf. E. Panofsky, Hercules am Scheidewege . . ., Berlin-Leipzig, 1929, p. I20, note 4. Alexander VII described this monument in minute detail in a letter addressed to his uncle; cf. Domenico Gnoli, Archivio storico dell'arte, II, 1889, pp. 317 ff. Moreover Alex- ander restored the Cestius pyramid. One of the strangest monu- ments Rome ever saw was the mock-obelisk the Pope was com- pelled to erect in pursuance of the terms of the Treaty of Pisa. This monument with its humiliating inscription was removed only after Alexander's death; cf. Pastor, op. cit., p. 381 and note 3; for a good reproduction of obelisk and inscription, cf. the title-engraving of Abb6 Regnier Desmarais' Histoire des De'meslez de la Cour de France . . ., s.l., I707. In imitation of the scene described by Vitruvius (preface to lib. ii) Pietro da Cortona celebrated Alexander VII as an Alex- ander the Great redivivus and himself as Deinocrates in an inter- esting drawing. Pietro represented himself and an assistant in the foreground about to offer to the Pope the draft of a monument that (shown in the background) is described by Vitruvius as Mt. Athos (here undoubtedly meant as an allusion to the Chigi moun- tains) re-worked into the "statue of a man in whose left . . . [are] shown the ramparts of an extensive city"; cf. W. K6rte, "Deinokrates und die barocke Phantasie," Die Antike, XIII, 1937, p. 306, and pl. 22. Such an heraldic trionfo occurred, on a</page><page sequence="32">182 THE ART BULLETIN confusione" Alexander's claim to lasting fame, in the mute poesy of an impresa which those who "knew" would readily understand.'49 But trionfo though it was, the monument carried the message of genuine humility. Strength and Enlightenment, the prime qualities demanded of a successful ruler of na- tions, had been sublimated in the Minerva program into the ideas of mental acuteness and inspired genius which were, and in particular the latter, gifts granted by the Holy Spirit "without regard to person.""' Bernini's artistic goal, the synthesis of apparently in- compatible elements, was achieved by radical rejection of the customary idea of triumph. The elephant is no more the subjugated, docile, if noble giant among the beasts. He was, first and foremost, to Bernini and his contemporaries, a pic- torial reminder of the highest qualities of the human mind. Perhaps only the greatest artist of the Italian High- Baroque could resolve the paradox: to portray in terms of a wild beast and a pagan obelisk the mental and spiritual aspirations of a forever ailing, scholarly Pope and beyond these, man's yearning for the intangible realm of Divine Wisdom. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY more modest scale to be sure, among the discarded drafts of the Minerva monument: here the stylized Chigi mountains were shown supporting the obelisk, which in turn was topped by the Chigi stars. One might ask whether this heraldic idea still lingers in the elephant, inasmuch as the word "elephas" was commonly thought to derive from the word "lophos," mountain. Isidore handed down this time-honored etymology to the Middle Ages (Etymologiae, lib. xII, sec. xiv, Patrologia Latina, LXXXII, col. 436) : "Elephantem Graeci a magnitudine corporis vocatum putant, quod formam montis praeferat; Graece enim mons 6~oc&lt; dicitur." I consider it quite likely that the etymology was derived from geo- graphical appellations, such as that of a mountain near the Hy- daspes River in India or that of the promontory of the African East coast, originally "Ras el Fil" (meaning "elephant"), for- merly 'EX ea? and now "Cape Felix"; cf. W. Pape, W6rterbuch der griec/ischen Eigennamen, 3rd ed. Braunschweig, i875, s.v. b 'EX&amp;eac. 149. We have a radical reversal of the mediaeval conception of the "idiota," for whose mind paintings would serve as charitable substitutes for the unattainable word, when we read in Tasso's "I1 Conte," op. cit., p. 386 that in the impresa (addressing itself to "qualcunque uomo di non ottuso intelletto") "il motto non sola- mente non e necessario, . . . ma e soverchio e vizioso." As late as 1719 we find our monument listed as an emblematic piece by Gis- bert Cuperus who (op. cit., pp. 241 and 242) almost in one breath reports: "Rudolphus Dux Sueviae Nummis suis Elephantum indi- dit," and "Alexander VII Pontifex Obeliscum Elephanto impo- suit." We cannot deny that Bernini's monument is in many respects a descendant of the personal eulogy of the emblematic conceits of the Renaissance. It is, after all, a synthesis of two elements, obelisk and elephant, which separately will be found in almost every self- respecting book of imprese. But while on the one hand the monu- ment, inasmuch as it is a novel amalgamation of two hitherto self- sufficient allegorical themes, has outgrown the proper proportions of the Renaissance emblem in more than one sense, its permanence of material has, on the other hand, lifted it above the sphere of the fleeting apotheosis, by which a great man would be celebrated on a given occasion and on one occasion only. 150. In the words of Cesare Ripa (op. cit., ed. Rome, 1603, p. 442) : "Non e la sapienza [scil. vera] numerata fra gli habiti virtuosi acquisti con vso, &amp; esperienza; ma e particolar dono dello Spirito santo, il quale spira doue gli piace, senza eccettione di persona."</page></plain_text>
