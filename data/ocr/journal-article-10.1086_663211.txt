            <p>In Thebais it is said that an angel gave knowledge of a mystical
tongue to Pachomius, Cornelius, and Syrus (who is said to be alive
right up to the present day and more than one hundred and ten years
old) in order that they might write to each other and speak by means
of a secret alphabet, concealing profound ideas with certain signs
and symbols. ( J<sc>EROME</sc>, <italic>Preface to the Rule

      <p>The Old English poem <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic>, probably
composed in the ninth century, is best known for a marvelous scene
in which the animated letters of the Lord's Prayer engage in battle
with the devil.2 The letters
of the words “Pater Noster” are both jumbled and represented
by English runes as the poem describes a battle, reminiscent of Prudentius's <italic>Psychomachia</italic> (ca. 405 CE), in which these letters attack
the fiend. As has been observed, the poem thus thematizes the physical
manifestation of power in writing.3 In light of this theme, a word like <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> (line 2b), literally rendered “skill-letters,” takes
on particular importance. Yet this unique and obscure word has not
received close scrutiny. The semantic field of this word creates a
crucial symbolic subtext for the poem: it weaves together ideas about
writing and embodiedness, and power and deception, that occur repeatedly
in Anglo-Saxon literature and its late antique precursors. Although
a literate Anglo-Saxon view of signs was undoubtedly affected by forces
in folk culture like runic literacy and charms, a mystical view of
alphabetic writing was also a part of Latin literacy. Anglo-Saxon
discourse about letters is encoded in grammatical commonplaces and
applies beyond the letters of prayer and scripture. Such discourse
represents a semiotic whereby all letters are divinatory signs and
symbols that (to paraphrase Jerome) conceal profound secrets.4 In pursuing this semiotic through
the connotations of the compound word <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>, I do not mean to suggest that Anglo-Saxon literati were credulous
alphabet-mystics nor that they derived their ideas directly from esoteric
eastern sources. Neither do I wish to imply that they were fully conscious
of the etymological connections I describe. I do wish to assert that
Anglo-Saxons were attuned to a mythic discourse about writing that
inflected their literacy in ways that are rarely considered. The semantic
associations of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>, drawn out by the poem's
depiction of letters and demons as competing polymorphic bodies, connect <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> to various legitimized forms of mystic writing
and also evoke ancient discourses about deceit and magic.</p>
      <p>The poem begins as follows: <verse-group>
            <verse-line>Saturnus cwæð:</verse-line>
            <verse-line>Hwæt, ic iglanda  eallra hæbbe</verse-line>

      </p>
      <p>The compound noun <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> is conventionally
rendered “skill in letters.” Although basically accurate,
this conventional translation does little justice to the semantic
complexity of the compound. “Skill in letters” neglects
the “right-hand head rule”—the basic linguistic
expectation of an English compound that the right-hand element constitutes
the morphological and semantic core of a nominal compound—by
rendering the left-hand element (<italic>gebregd</italic> )
as the head of the noun and thereby provoking the insertion of the
particle “in” to postulate the relationship between the
two nouns.6 By supplying this
relation, the translation implies a morphology of the compound, namely,
that the first element is a noun and that the whole is a copulative
compound. However, apt meanings for this compound can be discovered
if we observe the right-hand head rule, accept the slightly obscure
result, “skill-letters,” and then examine the elements
of the compound closely to determine what such letters might be.</p>
      <p>The first part of this essay considers <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> as an Old English compound. Drawing on the semantic implications
of inflected forms of the verb <italic>bregdan</italic> that occur
elsewhere in the poem, I interpret <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> as
a determinative compound in which the semantic range of the first
element broadens to include motion and change, and deception and seduction,
in its characterization of “skill.” Although analogous
Old English -<italic>stafas</italic> compounds suggest that this element
should remain mute, and that <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> could
simply beconstrued “deceit” or “trickery,”
the prominence of “letters” in the poem forces <italic>stafas</italic> back into the foreground, reminding readers of the
connection between ancient verbal arts and dissimulation. The compound
refers simultaneously to an abstracted “treacherous arts”
and to a more literal understanding of these arts as being founded
in the suspicious materiality of writing.</p>
      <p>The second part of this essay explores a literary-semantic context
for understanding the literal reference of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> to “shifting” or “deceitful” letters. Anglo-Saxon
culture had no shortage of referents for a word that refers to strange,
suspicious writing. <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic> 
itself, for example, draws attention to other forms of dangerous writing.
As the description of the Pater Noster letters ends, the poem goes
on to describe how the devil uses insidious forms of writing to harm
men:<disp-quote>
            <verse-group>

            <p>[At other times he binds the doomed man, his hands inhibits, when
he struggles for his life against the evil host. He writes on his
weapon a group of deadly marks, evil letters, inscribes the blade,
the glory of the sword.]</p>
         </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>This passage clearly depicts the inscription of runes on weapons
as a way to enhance or inhibit their potency. It is thus easy to suggest,
as Robert Menner did, that the interpretation of Pater Noster letters
as powerful signs derives from the superposition of Germanic folk
beliefs on the instruments of Latin literacy because “the magic
power of the rune was a deep-seated belief of the Germanic peoples.”7 Although the poem certainly depicts <italic>wælnotas</italic> (harmful marks) as having magical power,
the association between runes and rune magic remains a matter of debate.
Many experts believe that runic writing was never seriously believed
to have magical properties in much of the ancient North.8 R. I. Page has argued that the word <italic>rūn</italic> (which means “mystery” or “secret”),
although often used in compounds associated with magic, never refers
to inscribed characters themselves.9 Without attempting to solve this problem, we can nonetheless suggest
that Anglo-Saxon literati saw in runes a semiotic principle of secrecy
that also drove their fascination with other forms of secret writing.</p>
      <p>Their interest in alphabets and ciphers is evident. Stretching
from the Venerable Bede in the late seventh century to Byrhtferth
of Ramsey in the late tenth century, the works of learned Anglo-Saxons
contain examples and explanations of what Byrhtferth called the “mysteries
of the alphabet” (þæra stafena gerena).10 In book 3 of his <italic>Enchiridion</italic> (988–96 CE), Byrhtferth explains the significance of Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew letters as well as the meanings of accent marks
and various paratextual <italic>notae sententiarum</italic> derived
from Isidore.11 Runic, Greek,
Hebrew, and other exotic alphabets can be found everywhere in Old
English manuscripts, although Greek and Hebrew were languages barely
known to Anglo-Saxon scholars. Old English riddles and their Latin
counterparts linger not only on objects from the material culture
of monastic writing, like pens and parchment, but on the alphabet
and in some cases on the shapes of the specific letters themselves.
Such apparent curiosities represent a widespread academic tradition
exploring the symbolic complexities of the alphabet. The Continental <italic>Versus de nominibus litterarum</italic>, or <italic>Versus de alphabeto</italic>, for example, contains verse descriptions of each letter of the
alphabet.12 In <italic>De tempore
rationum</italic> (ca. 725 CE), Bede describes a letter-substitution
encryption by which, as he claims, monks might pass secret messages
to each other “or else fool the uninitiated as if by magic.”13 This same code is demonstrated
in a fragmentary vernacular riddle, which points out that it is “lytel
cræft” (not difficult) even if one lives with many men.14 Such works demonstrate that Anglo-Saxon
linguistic self-consciousness took a particularly graphic, and indeed
cryptographic, form. Anglo-Saxons like Bede and Byrhtferth were fascinated
by signs. They readily perceived the semiotic and mythic resonances
of alphabetic forms.</p>
      <p> 
         <italic>Gebregdstafas</italic> could refer to cryptographic systems
like that described by Bede, the Atbash code or <italic>scinderatio
fonorum</italic>, a method of encryption by scrambling letters used
by Cicero and explained (in an insular context) by Virgilius Maro
Grammaticus.15 It could also
describe multicolored letters like those drawn on the hand of God
on folio 49r of the Leofric Missal, or exotic alphabets like that
recorded in the <italic>Cosmographia</italic> of Aethicus Ister (seventh
century CE). It could likewise refer to the mystic alphabet reputedly
known to the Egyptian abbot Pachomius (d. 346 CE), and perhaps even
to the mystical writing systems of late antique Judaism with which
Solomon was associated. One might argue that <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>, if not a loan translation, represents an Old English attempt to
characterize mystical or otherwise secret writing that is expressed
in such Latin phrases as <italic>mysticae linguae</italic>, <italic>alphabetum speciale</italic>, <italic>litterae altiores</italic>,
or <italic>litterae permolesta</italic>. The main purpose of the second
part of this essay, however, is to show how the two elements of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> evoke the semantic field of their respective
Latin equivalents <italic>fallacia</italic> and <italic>elementa</italic>. Influential texts such as Isidore of Seville's <italic>Etymologies</italic> (ca. 630 CE) and Prudentius's <italic>Contra Symmachum</italic> (ca.
403 CE) use these terms to construct a Christian discourse about magic
that implicates writing in the fallacies of pagan animism. Thus, I
suggest, <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> evokes a Christian rhetoric
against pagan wisdom that associates verbal deception with sorcery.</p>
      <p>Marie Nelson has already argued that the poem is intimately concerned
with magic, since it describes “a context for the performance
of a charm [i.e., the Pater Noster sequence]” and that it is
thus a “fictional representation of an oral performance.”16 In her reading, Solomon is the
magician who by means of the Pater Noster provides a remedy for Saturn's
troubled mind. This reading depends in part on misconstruing the preposition
in line 61a, “bysig æfter bocum,” as an adverb of
time. Saturn is “restless after [reading] books” and thus
seeks Solomon's aid. There is no need to interpolate the verb here
if we recognize that <italic>æfter</italic> is a preposition
indicating purpose or direction toward a goal. This prepositional
use is common in descriptions of hunting animals or of desiring God's
love, which casts Saturn's “illness” more as an intellectual
and moral failing than a medical condition. Nelson clearly shows,
nonetheless, how <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic> suggests that
letters are magically “spoken into life.”17</p>
      <p>These anthropomorphized letters suggest an anxiety about the materiality
of writing and the ability to discern spiritual reality through this
medium. As Katherine O'Brien O'Keeffe contends, the tension between
speech and writing in the poem “speaks to a consciousness which
accords writing its own power: to objectify, to hold, to fix, to hide.”18 Yet <italic>Solomon and Saturn
I</italic> is also preoccupied with metamorphosis, and the anthropomorphism
of the Pater Noster letters is a corollary to the deceptive fluidity
of demonic forms. The demons of the poem are characterized by no specific
shape but rather by their uncanny fluidity; they can take the form
of a snake, change in shape or color, or grow wings. The general expression
of this shifting appears in line 110a, where the letters <italic>N</italic> and <italic>O</italic> take their turn to confront the devil and
scourge what the poet describes as his “fræmde flæschoman”
(strange body) (line 110). While strangeness of body is meant to depict
the deception of devils—their supernatural perversion of material
order—by analogy, strangeness infects the implicitly human forms
of the Pater Noster letters. The power of writing to fix and to hide
is a power to deceive. This anxiety is captured in the semantic depths
of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>.</p>

         <title>THE SEMANTICS OF <italic>GEBREGDSTAFAS</italic> AS AN OLD ENGLISH
COMPOUND</title>
         <p>The first difficulty in considering line 2b is that the spacing
of the manuscript allows alternative word divisions. <italic>Solomon
and Saturn I</italic> is imperfectly attested in two manuscripts:
Cambridge Corpus Christi College 41 (CCCC 41), in which the first
ninety-four lines of the poem are written in the margin of a copy
of the Old English Bede and thankfully therefore supply lines 1–30,
which are illegible in the otherwise more complete Corpus Christi
MS 422. In CCCC 41, <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> is broken over
the first two lines of the manuscript: <italic>gebregd</italic> ends
line 1, and <italic>stafas</italic> is the first word of line 2. The
poem's first editor, John Mitchell Kemble, located the word boundary
between an adverb + verb compound and a noun, presumably allowing
the line break to influence his interpretation of the word boundaries.
He thus renders the half-line “þurhgebregd stafas”
and translates “thoroughly turned over the letters.”19 Menner's edition, which superseded
Kemble's in 1941, attaches <italic>gebregd</italic>- to <italic>stafas</italic> as the first element in what is now a nominal compound and thus
renders <italic>þurh</italic> a preposition marking means or
instrument,20 and the syntax
is thus organized (as O'Neill notes) by rhetorical <italic>apo koinu</italic> as the phrase “þurh gebregdstafas” modifies both
the verb phrase that precedes and that which follows (lines 2a and
3a).21 Menner makes this shift
without reference to Kemble's reading, but he explains that he understands
the word to be a noun + noun compound meaning “literally skill-letters,”
which he then rationalizes as “skill in letters.”22 Elliot Van Kirk Dobbie's edition
for the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records series concurs with Menner's edition
of these lines. Though Dobbie's notes suggest that <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> literally means “letters of cunning,”23 subsequent definitions and translations have
adhered closely to Menner's. The Bosworth-Toller dictionary defines <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> with the abstract phrase “literary arts,”
while the <italic>Dictionary of Old English</italic> keeps closer
to the sense of the individual elements, rendering <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> “skill in letters” as Menner does.24 Among recent essays on <italic>Solomon and Saturn</italic> 
            <italic>I</italic>  only O'Neill and Wilcox translate this
part of the poem. O'Neill follows the <italic>Dictionary of Old English</italic> in his appendix, although in another part of his essay he paraphrases
this passage as “skill in deciphering different alphabets”25—a translation that approaches
my understanding of the word since, though it still makes skill the
head of the noun, it interprets <italic>stafas</italic> as a reference
to actual letters rather than literary arts. Jonathan Wilcox also
accepts the <italic>Dictionary of Old English </italic> definition
but additionally represents the lurking negative potential of <italic>gebregd</italic>  by translating “cunning skills in
letters.”26</p>
         <p>The first element of the compound, typically treated as a variant
spelling of the strong masculine noun <italic>gebrægd</italic> (<italic>gebregd</italic> 1: “deceitfulness,” “cunning”)
is indistinguishable from another noun, <italic>gebregd</italic>,
meaning “sudden movement” or “woven material”
(<italic>gebregd</italic> 2). The appearance of two words as separate
heads in the <italic>Dictionary of Old English</italic> suggests that
they are etymologically distinct. However, these two words are easily
confused since the loss of the palatal /g/ and concomitant lengthening
of the preceding vowel is a systematic occurrence, especially in West
Saxon and especially before /d/.27 The mutually variant spellings of <italic>gebregd</italic> 1 and <italic>gebregd</italic> 2 suggest that these words were perceived as homonyms.
If they did not coalesce, their meanings very likely were reflected
in the perception of a literate Anglo-Saxon. In Old Norse, the two
senses coalesce that are recorded as separate words in Old English.
The Old Norse noun <italic>bragð</italic> includes among its meanings “sudden
or brisk movement” and “embroidered figure” just
as those two separate senses are ascribed to <italic>gebregd</italic> 2 in Old English.28 However,
the selfsame Old Norse noun means “trick, scheme, device,”
a meaning attributed to <italic>gebregd</italic> 1 in the <italic>Dictionary of Old English</italic>. Within the semantic range of
this one Norse word it is easy to see “trickery” as a
connotation extending the basic meaning of “sudden movement.”
We should not, of course, expect Old English words to reflect precisely
their Old Norse cognates, but the consistency of the semantic range
in this particular word across both languages suggests that the meanings
were already established in the Germanic stock or that the Norse and
Old English words exerted some influence on each other. The related
Norse verb <italic>bregða</italic>, for example, is attested with
many of the same senses as <italic>bregdan</italic>: to cause to move
suddenly, to draw a sword, to change in shape or color.29 The inclusion of both meanings
in a single Norse noun, coupled with the similarity in meaning between
Old Norse and Old English, suggests the strength of semantic connection
between the two Old English nouns. As a result of this connection,
the noun that forms the first element of the compound <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> is susceptible to a variety of overlapping interpretations: referring
in various stages of abstraction to sudden movement, weaving, shape
shifting, and deceit, this word is a “lexical intertext”
that expresses Anglo-Saxon concern about the signifying capacities
of writing.30 While it certainly
refers to cunning or trickery, this cunning is an abstraction based
on the swift and intricate motions of weaving. The deceitful arts
that Saturn uses to unlock the secrets of the ancients are associated
with a kind of textual magic, letters whose form is obfuscated or
impossible to fix. Such associations are drawn out through the semantic
play of the poetic <italic>Solomon and Saturn</italic> 
            <italic>I</italic>  itself, which uses derivatives of the verb <italic>bregdan</italic> frequently.</p>
         <p> 
            <italic>Bregdan</italic> and its derivatives are favored words
in the vocabulary of this poem, which demonstrates a different shade
of its semantic field with each use. <italic>Bregdan</italic> occurs
four times in <italic>Solomon and Saturn</italic>, three of them during
the “Pater Noster Battle Sequence.” First, that “bocstafa
brego,” the letter <italic>R</italic>, “bregdað”
(drags) the devil by his hair (lines 97a–100a). Second, <italic>bregdan</italic> appears as part of the formula “bleoum bregdað”
as the poet describes how the word of God will always triumph over
the fiend “næfre hi þæs syllice bleoum bregdað”
(no matter how he changes his appearance) (lines 155b–56a).
Third, in the conclusion to the Pater Noster battle scene <italic>abredan</italic> is the verb that describes drawing out a sword.
Finally, in <italic>Solomon and Saturn II</italic>, Saturn recalls
how he sat in conversation with the wise men of the Philistines and <italic>boca tobræddon</italic>, “laid out” or perhaps “picked
apart” books (lines 421a–23a). <italic>Gebregdan</italic> also has paranomastic, and possibly etymological, relations with
the similarly unique verb of line 16b of <italic>Solomon and Saturn
I</italic> that Dobbie emends to <italic>gebryrded</italic> where
Menner reads <italic>gebrydded</italic>.31</p>
         <p>Accumulating through the text of <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic>, these various uses of the verb create an extended paranomasia that
overlays the compound noun of line 2b with the semantic field of the
verb, signifying shape shifting, speed, and violence. The word could
be considered a verbal + noun compound formed on <italic>gebregdan</italic>. This type of compound is not common in Old English, and there are
a number in which the first element is ambiguously either nominal
or verbal.32 Nonetheless, Carr's
study of <italic>Nominal Compounds in Germanic</italic> lists several
instances in which the verbal interpretation is more obligatory: <italic>weaxgeorn</italic>, <italic>ceorfæx</italic>, and perhaps especially
worth comparing to <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> are those formed
on <italic>wrītan</italic>: <italic>wrītbred</italic>, <italic>wrītīren</italic>, and <italic>wrītseax</italic>. These compounds are sensibly rendered using a modern English present
participle: “writing tablet,” “writing tool,”
and “writing sword.” By analogy to these <italic>writ</italic> - compounds, and considering the meaning of <italic>gebregd</italic> 2discussed above, we might translate <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> as “weaving” or “shifting” letters.</p>
         <p>The complexities of <italic>gebregd</italic> suggest pertinent
determinative functions for that element in the compound by demonstrating
a wider semantic sphere than that indicated by “skill.”
Perhaps the best evidence of the meaning of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>, however, lies in the comparison to similar -<italic>stafas</italic> compounds. This comparison suggests that <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> is a pleonastic or “poetic” compound.33 One of the key functions of poetic compounds
is to provide appropriate metrical and alliterative components. Thus
it is usual to find poetic compounds in groups of synonyms that substitute
the first element with words that alliterate differently. Other -<italic>stafas</italic> compounds in which <italic>stafas</italic> is translated “works”
or “arts,” or not translated at all, constitute potential
synonyms for <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>. Taken together these
compounds display some patterns pertinent to <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>: <italic>-stæf</italic>  forms compounds readily and
frequently with words that are adjectival or easily construed as modifying
the head. Furthermore, these first elements are overwhelmingly negative,
involving blame, deceit, trickery, and harm. <italic>Edwitstafas</italic> (rendering <italic>opprobrium</italic> in the Paris Psalter), <italic>wrohtstafas</italic> (<italic>Elene</italic>, line 924), <italic>hearmstafas</italic> (<italic>Genesis</italic>, line 939; <italic>Guthlac</italic>, line 226), and <italic>facenstafas</italic> (<italic>Beowulf</italic>, line 1017) are all compound nouns attested specifically
in poetry and meaning “reproach,” “accusations,”
and “malice,” respectively.34 The first element in each of these compounds helps elucidate
the morphology and meaning of <italic>-stafas</italic> compounds. <italic>Edwitan</italic> is attested behaving as both a strong and a weak
verb and occurs almost exclusively in glosses, reflecting the particular
need to coin compounds in rendering foreign texts. <italic>Hearmian</italic> is a weak verb derived from the noun <italic>hearm</italic>, which
is further attested as an adjective; which allows us to construe <italic>hearmstafas</italic> as an adjective + noun compound in which the
first element is of a clear semantic type denoting a kind of or a
quality of the head. <italic>Facen</italic>, though a noun, frequently
forms adjectival phrases, and has an equivalent adjective <italic>facne</italic>. The compound <italic>facenstafas</italic> occurs
only in <italic>Beowulf</italic> (line 1017) and has been translated “false
treacheries” and “treacherous arts.”35 Each of these compounds, that is, conforms to
the expectation that the left-hand element should modify the right.
Comparison to these similar compounds is suggestive evidence that <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> is part of a lexicon of synonymous poetic
compounds intended to relay suspicious and harmful behavior.</p>
         <p>However, there seems to be some ambivalence in deciding how to
treat <italic>stafas</italic> in such compounds. Bosworth-Toller renders <italic>hearmstafas</italic> as simply synonymous with its first element,
reducing the <italic>stafas</italic> to silence: the acts, or perhaps “arts”
of treachery are not differentiated from treachery as a concept, and
the first element appears to be the core of the compound in direct
opposition to the usual behavior of English compounds. The <italic>facenstafas</italic> of <italic>Beowulf</italic> are particularly
worth comparing to <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> because of a clear
semantic overlap: as nouns both <italic>facen</italic> and <italic>gebregd</italic> denote deceitfulness and guile. If <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> is translated according to the same logic that elides the “art”
denoted by <italic>stafas</italic> we might thus consider it simply
to mean “craft.” We can, in fact, consider both elements
of the compound to mean “craft” or “art” and
thus understand <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> to function as a conventional
poetic compound, translated literally “skill-art” and
meaning something like “erudition” or “deceit.”
In Old English as in Latin, the plural word for “letters”
commonly refers metonymically to writing or even more generally to
learning. But there is a danger in overapplying this metonym. <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic> insists that we acknowledge the <italic>stafas</italic> in <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>. The violent letters
of the Pater Noster that dominate the action of the poem suggest a
referent for suddenly moving or changing letters, as do other textual
objects and legendary alphabets in Anglo-Saxon literature.</p>
         <p>Further evidence of the semantic depths of both elements of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> can be gleaned from common Latin equivalents.
Old English glosses on the Gospels use <italic>gebregd</italic> to
gloss <italic>fallacia</italic>, and supporting evidence suggests
that this gloss represents a very close equivalence across the two
languages. The description of letters as elements (<italic>elementa</italic>) was a grammatical commonplace, and the cosmological analogy it
implied was readily perceived by Anglo-Saxon grammarians. Combined,
the ideas evoked by both elements of the compound express a great
deal about the untrustworthy materiality of writing.</p>
         <p>The cosmological depiction of letters as “atoms” figures
clearly in Anglo-Saxon grammatical culture. Following Priscian, both
Ælfric of Eynsham and Byrhtferth of Ramsey define the letter
as an “atom” (<italic>athomis</italic>, <italic>untodælednys</italic>) and an elementum “ad similitudinem elementorum mundi”
(because of its similarity with natural elements), as Ælfric
writes.36 The cosmological analogy
to <italic>elementa</italic> mythologized letters, associating them
with suspicious pagan knowledge and magic. The “elements”
were a central concept in the “atomist” cosmology of several
strains of ancient Greek thought, and the analogy between physical
particles and letters of the alphabet is the basic analogy of ancient
alphabet mysticism.37 In a later
antique tradition Democritus, one of the founding atomist philosophers,
was imagined as a “great sage with magical powers.”38 This notion of Democritus was reinforced
by Pliny, who claimed that Democritus was the author of a treatise
concerning the magical herbology of the Magi, a herbology that described
the plants used to summon their gods.39 This legendary view of Democritus is presumably based on
an obfuscation of his atomist physics, but in important Christian
texts the “elements” continued to be identified with supernatural
forces.</p>
         <p>In Ælfric's use of the phrase “elementorum mundi”
we may perceive an allusion to Paul's epistle to the Galatians in
which he characterizes ignorance of God's law as servitude “sub
elementis mundi” (Gal. 4:3).40 This passage has provoked conflicting commentary. While both John
Chrysostom and Jerome treat it quite literally, Augustine explains
this as a reference both to the heavenly bodies (stars created from
the physical elements earth, air, fire, and water) and to the demonic
spirits that controlled them.41 Augustine's identification of <italic>elementa</italic> with mystic
forces is fantastically and emphatically dramatized in the pseudoepigraphical
tradition of Solomon. In the <italic>Testament of Solomon</italic>, a Greek text of the second or third century, Solomon learns how
to subdue demons with the aid of a magic ring given to him by God.
In the <italic>Testament</italic>, the word <italic>stoicheia</italic> (elements) first describes the “seven demonic stars”
and later the thirty-six spirits, various animal-human hybrids who
describe themselves as “heavenly bodies” (<italic>stoicheia</italic>).42 These “world rulers
of the darkness of this age” are revealed to be “decans,”
each of whom rules over one tenth of the three-hundred and sixty degrees
of the zodiac. According to Origen, the decans have also divided among
themselves the various regions of the human body.43 The very analogy that elevated letters to cosmological
significance also thereby—in the pseudoepigraphical tradition
of Solomon—connected them to the same suspicious corporeality
that characterizes the “fræmde flæschoman”
of demons.</p>
         <p>The importance of this cosmic imagery to the purpose of the poem
is demonstrated by the prose section that has been marginalized by
modern editions. In the context of mystical ideas about elements,
this prose can be seen as quite fully integrated with the verse. Occupying
pages 7–12 of CCCC 422, the prose constitutes a considerable
proportion of the manuscript. Both Elliot Van Kirk Dobbie and Robert
Menner (whose editions were published in 1941 and 1942, respectively)
ignore the prose, and as a result it has largely been lost to critical
view. Even Kemble, who did edit and translate the prose in his 1848
edition, describes it as a fragment and an “insertion,”
as though it were a supplementary, or simply mistaken, addition to
the verse. Yet themes and images clearly link this prose to the first
poem. The prose describes a symbolic shape-changing conflict between
Satan and the Pater Noster. The combatants take various opposed forms,
some of them abstract and others more concrete. When the devil is
wrath, the Pater Noster will be peace; when the devil is in the likeness
of a sword, the Pater Noster will be like a golden breastplate; when
the devil is in the likeness of a wolf, the Pater Noster will be a
golden chain.44 The Pater Noster
finally emerges as a cosmic demigod with “golden fingers and
each of them is individually thirty thousand times longer than all
the world or earth; and in the Pater Noster's right hand is the likeness
of a golden sword . . . its gleam is brighter than all the constellations
of the heavens.”45 This
passage demonstrates the consonance of the prose imagery with that
of the verse: the shape-shifting motif recalls the poem's characterization
of demons as “fræmde flæschoman” unstable
in form, taking the shape of snakes or sprouting wings; the swords
and breastplates of spiritual battle occur here as in the poem. The
imagery of giant cosmic bodies evokes the depictions of constellations
in astrological works like Cicero's <italic>Aratea</italic>, which
can be found in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.46 It also recalls Augustine's interpretation of the “elements”
as stars or the demonic entities they represent.</p>
         <p>Other grammatical conceits connect writing with corporeality directly.
According to grammarians like Donatus and Priscian, relayed in Isidore's <italic>Etymologies</italic> 1.4.16, letters have three aspects: <italic>nomen</italic>, <italic>potestas</italic>, and <italic>figura</italic> (shape or character). The Old English vocabulary of shape and color
is overlapping. When <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic> describes
how demons change their form, the poet writes they “bleom bregdað,”
which can mean changing in shape or color.47 Similarly, <italic>hīw</italic>, a word whose modern
reflex “hue” refers only to color, could mean either color
or shape in Old English. Byrhtferth of Ramsey uses it to refer to
diacritics and other textual signs when he writes that “bōceras
habbað on heora cræfte wurðfulle hī w and tacna”
(scholars have in their discipline worthy figures and signs).48</p>
         <p>Recognizing that letters have shapes and associating them with “shapes”
summoned by magic are two different things. Just as they theorized
that letters were analogous to “atoms,” however, insular
grammarians perceived the form of letters as analogous to human bodies.
To Virgilius Maro Grammaticus, the three aspects of the letter suggest
an analogy to the nature of man, who has a body, a spirit, and a soul.49 Ælfric of Eynsham writes,
following Priscian, “Just as a combination [of elements] makes
up a complete body, so do these when joined together make an utterance
that can be expressed in letters, almost as a type of body—or
rather as an actual body.”50 The motif of embodiment that casts the materiality of letters as
of a kind with human bodies was already established in the both the
work of Virgilius and in Ælfric's far more traditional epitome.
This conceptual conflation is, furthermore, evident in Anglo-Saxon
visual art where the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic decoration of
Gospel books expresses an equation of the matter of letters with human
and animal bodies. Laura Kendrick has shown that “the equation
of the body of Christ with the letter of scripture became a venerable
formula,” the orthodoxy of which was secured by its incorporation
in the <italic>Glossa ordinaria</italic> and, moreover, that this
model effected the “mythologizing of alphabetic writing as a
bodily trace.”51 Such
well-established symbolic conceits and grammatical metaphors emphasized
the materiality of letters, both their function as the indivisible
units or “elements” of discourse and their embodiedness.
These metaphors provided the cosmological associations that lie behind
the animation of Pater Noster letters in <italic>Solomon and Saturn
I</italic>, but these metaphors also suggest an unfavorable parallel
with the similarly embodied, form-shifting demons against which those
anthropomorphized letters struggle.</p>
         <p>The association of the physical elements with anthropomorphized
spirits is, according to Prudentius, a naïve pagan habit. John
Hermann has already pointed out the many parallels between the depictions
of spiritual battle in Prudentius's <italic>Psychomachia</italic> and
the Pater Noster's battle against demons in the poetic <italic>Solomon
and Saturn I</italic>. In <italic>Contra Symmachum</italic>, too,
we find images that reappear in the Old English poem. The Latin poem
demonstrates the inappropriate attribution of shape and body to nature
and suggests that to serve under the elements of the world, as Galatians
intimates (Gal. 4:3), is not only to have a naïve commitment
to worldly life but, more specifically, to draw pagan conclusions
about the forces that structure the universe. <italic>Contra Symmachum</italic> mocks foolish pagans who “make a divinity out of unreal shapes”
and adjures them to desist in “[modeling] incorporeal things
in counterfeit bodies” (desine, si pudor est, gentilis ineptia,
tandem res incorpores simulates fingere membris). Prudentius's characterization
of pagan belief reinforces Augustine's interpretation of Galatians
4:3. Directly after Prudentius lodges his general accusation at silly
pagans, he adjures specifically that they “desine terga hominis
plumis obducere” (cease to cover a human back with feathers).52 This image is another detail of <italic>Solomon and Saturn</italic>'s depiction of demonic shape shifting,
in which a demon “æfter bancofan feðerhoman onfoð”
(grows wings on its back) (lines 151b–152a). The analogous imagery
suggests that <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic> 's depiction
of demons draws on a conventional Christian critique of pagan animism,
namely, that they make “bodies” out of what are merely
elements.</p>
         <p>Isidore's examples of magic are drawn in part from Prudentius and
also characterize magic predominantly as shape shifting. The word <italic>elementa</italic> plays an important role in this discourse too,
as it refers both to the matter of the physical world and implies,
as we saw, the supernatural forces that govern that world in pagan
belief. According to Isidore, magic consists primarily of the perversion
of natural forms by illicit human will: changing men into the form
of animals (in bestiarum formas convertebantur) or “agitating
the elements” (elementa concutiant).53 In its Isidorian context the phrase “elementa concutiant”
does not refer to letters, but no grammatically trained Anglo-Saxon
author would have missed the connotation. Isidore's verb <italic>concutio</italic> also seems to confirm Grein's suggestion that “agitation”
is another potential meaning of <italic>gebregd</italic>.54 Ælfric's <italic>Glossary</italic> (ca. 995 CE) shows that <italic>concutio</italic> was part of his
vocabulary; he explains that it means “ic sceace oððe
ic samod slea” (I shake or I knock together).55 Old English <italic>sceacan</italic> is synonymous
with <italic>bregdan</italic> insofar as the meanings of both with
regard to physical objects generally indicate rapid movement and,
more specifically, insofar as they both can mean “to weave.”56 Although its denotative reference
is to a kind of writing, <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> could have
more abstractly connoted “agitated elements,” drawing
on a well-established cosmological analogy to import the Christian
discourse about pagan animism into <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic>. The “agitation of elements” describes the manipulation
of the physical universe—either by controlling the weather or
by magically interfering with subatomic structures. The magic that
Isidore thus defines is associated with the pagan desire to “animate”
the elements by imagining them to be gods. The constituents of the
Old English compound <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> mirror the notion
of “agitated elements” and, in the context of <italic>Solomon and Saturn I,</italic> turn this connotation toward the characterization
of dangerous, deceptive text.</p>
         <p>Just as the cosmological implications of the grammatical term <italic>elementum</italic> reflect on the implications of <italic>stafas</italic>, so the purpose of <italic>gebregd</italic> may be elucidated by
considering its Latin equivalent, <italic>fallacia</italic>. One key
clue to the semantic field of <italic>gebregd</italic> is its appearance
as a gloss in the Lindisfarne Gospels (Matt. 13:22) where <italic>fallacia divitiarum</italic> (deceitfulness of riches) is rendered “gebregdas
&amp; leasunga þara wlenca.”57 Ealdred, the glossator of the Lindisfarne Gospels, added
his Old English toward the end of the tenth century, much later than
the Gospels themselves, which date to the end of the seventh century.
He is apparently alone in using <italic>gebregd</italic> as such a
gloss, yet the semantic connection of this word to <italic>fallacia</italic> is reinforced by similar glosses. <italic>Fallacia</italic> is very
commonly glossed with <italic>leas</italic>, a synonym of <italic>gebregd</italic>, meaning deceit, trick, or illusion. This synonym,
furthermore, combines with <italic>bregd</italic> in what seems to
be another pleonastic compound: <italic>leasbregd</italic>, which
Wulfstan uses in his prose to describe tricks performed by a magician
who “hiwode þurh drycræft fela leasbregda”
(shaped many deceits by means of sorcery).58 While these examples suggest the identity of <italic>fallacia</italic> and <italic>gebregd</italic>, other examples demonstrate the association
of <italic>fallacia</italic> with moral deception, pagan belief, and
magic. This kind of association is reflected in various figurative
meanings of <italic>bregdan</italic>—to weave a malicious net,
to lure or seduce the mind, or to pretend or assume an appearance.59</p>
         <p> 
            <italic>Fallacia</italic>, “deceit,” is the concept
that characterizes both classical philosophy and sorcery in the Bible.
Solomon's suggestion, in <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic> , that
he has sought wisdom in Greek crafts (lines 4, 201b) associates his
use of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> with the precisely the kind
of sophistry derided by Paul as vain deceit or “inanem fallaciam”
(Col. 2:8). The term is taken up in Christian apologetics in the work
of Tertullian and Justin Martyr, who were concerned to distinguish
Christianity from pagan philosophy and to defend Christianity from
charges of sorcery. In <italic>De praescriptione hereticorum</italic>, Tertullian characterizes Greek thought as a divided, sectarian
affair, citing scriptural passages from Timothy, Wisdom, and Colossians
to oppose worldly knowledge with the knowledge that comes from the “porch
of Solomon” and which is “sought in simplicity of heart”
(Wisd. 1:1). The classical verbal arts, rhetoric and dialectic, are “vain
deceit” and “words which spread like cancer” (2
Tim. 2:17). In of light this, it may be that <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> refers specifically to the evasive arts of rhetoric and dialectic.
With the exception of Alcuin of York, who echoes Tertullian's rhetorical
question from this very chapter of the <italic>praescriptione</italic> in his letter to Higbald of Lindisfarne (793 CE), Tertullian seems
to have been little known to Anglo-Saxons.60 The assault on Greek learning in Tertullian's text nevertheless
contributes to a Christian discourse against pagan knowledge that
was spread through more popular texts and the key terms of which are
found in the Vulgate. Although Augustine would ultimately rescue classical
learning from blanket rejection, his <italic>Confessions</italic> frequently
repeat the accusation that rhetoric is a morally suspicious practice.
Isidore blames Greek philosophy for the introduction of heresy into
Christianity, suggesting ideas from specific philosophies that generated
heretical thought (<italic>Etym</italic>. 8.6.22).</p>
         <p>A second biblical use of <italic>fallacia</italic> suggests that “deceit”
is an accusation of duplicity that specifically encompasses magic.
In the Acts of the Apostles, Paul blinds the magician Elymas, addressing
him thus: “O full of all guile, and of all deceit, child of
the devil” (O plene omni dolo et omni fallacia fili diaboli)
(Acts 13:10). Isidore, too, uses <italic>fallacia</italic> to explain
the deceptive or illusory nature of magic when he describes how the
pythoness in 1 Kings (Vulgate) 28:7–19 summoned the shade of
the prophet Samuel. Can we believe, he asks, that this was really
Samuel or was it “a fantastic illusion created by the deception
of Satan?” (si tamen animam prophetae fuisse credamus, et non
aliquam phantasmaticam inlusionem Satanae fallacia factam?) (<italic>Etym</italic>. 8.9.7).</p>
         <p>Further examples demonstrate the figuration of classical verbal
deception as a kind of sorcery rooted in deception about form. In
Martianus Capella's <italic>De nuptiis Philologii et Mercurii</italic>, Bacchus suggests that Dialectica must be a “Marsian sorceress”
because her argumentative power is symbolized by a venomous snake;
she is likewise an “alluring charlatan” (circulatrix pellacissima),
so vicious rumor would have it, “devoted to deceitful trickery”
(versipellis studii).61 Martianus's
word for “deceitful trickery” is <italic>versipellis</italic>, a noun whose predominantly figurative meanings “dissimulation”
and “craftiness” derive from its literal reference to “skin
changing.” This noun occurs once in the Vulgate (Prov. 14:25)
where the Douay-Rheims Version renders it “double dealing,”
but in book 8, chapter 34 of his <italic>Natural History</italic> (ca.
77 CE) Pliny explains in some detail how the legends of lycanthropy,
though apocryphal in themselves, captured the credulous imagination
enough to convert <italic>versipellis</italic> into a common accusation
of duplicity.62 One Anglo-Saxon
source uses this accusation to characterize the Antichrist. In a passage
about Æthelwold explaining the private offices he offered to
supplement the regular liturgy, the author recommends petitioning
for the assistance of the saints “so that protected by their
merciful intercession we may be found worthy to conquer the manifold
trickery of the shape-shifting Antichrist” (ut eorum pia intercession
protecti multiformem uersipellis Antichristi et memborrorum eius fallaciam
expugnare).63 This passage—in
a collection of texts compiled at Winchester and which may have been
written by Æthelwold's biographer—demonstrates the close
association of ideas represented by <italic>fallacia</italic> and <italic>versipellis</italic>, deceit and shape shifting, in the depiction
of the Antichrist. <italic>Versipellis</italic> manifests a conceptual
overlap between its literal and figurative senses and suggests, as
does <italic>fallacia</italic>, an almost necessary connection between
physical, intellectual, and moral deception. Just as <italic>versipellis</italic> refers literally to skin changing and figuratively to deception,
so <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> refers to literally changing “bodies”
of letters and simultaneously insinuates more sinister forms of deception.</p>

         <title>PAGAN MAGIC AND ANCIENT ALPHABET MYSTICISM</title>
         <p>If <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> can be rendered “shifting,” “weaving,”
or “deceptive” letters, it remains to discover a referent
for that word. Some possibilities are suggested in both the practices
of and lore about writing that Anglo-Saxons learned from antiquity.
One suggestive Latin example indicates that a phrase like “literary
arts,” to revert momentarily to the conventional interpretation
of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>, could indeed have been understood
to connote magic. Pliny's <italic>Natural History</italic>, a text
whose influence in the medieval encyclopedia tradition was perhaps
second only to Isidore's <italic>Etymologies</italic>, is especially
identified as a source of charms and remedies and is thus already
imbricated in the Anglo-Saxon discourse on magic.64 In book 14, chapter 5 of the <italic>Historia</italic>, Pliny recounts Rhemmius Palaemon's near miraculous feats of husbandry
on his estate near Rome. The productivity of this estate was such
that Palaemon's neighbors could only assume that it was a result of <italic>litterus eius altioribus</italic>. Rackham translates this “exceedingly
profound studies,” extending the “depth” of <italic>altus</italic> to metaphor and taking <italic>litterae</italic> to
encompass the entire field of literary learnedness (as the plural
frequently did in both classical and medieval Latin).65 Referring to this passage in Pliny, the <italic>Oxford Latin Dictionary</italic> lists “magic” as the
meaning of <italic>litterae altiores</italic> and other senses of <italic>altus</italic> demonstrate how this meaning might be derived.66 <italic>Altus</italic> means both “high”
and “deep” and therefore figuratively not only “ancient”
or “profound” but also “secret.” Rendering
Pliny's phrase as “most ancient knowledge” or “deeply
secret learning” begins to demonstrate the mystical valences
suggested both by the context of the <italic>Natural History</italic> and by the dictionary definition but that is passed over by Rackham's
more cautious translation. Dictionaries that concur in this interpretation
of <italic>litterae altiores</italic>, however, all cite only this
example from the <italic>Natural History</italic>. There is no other
evidence that “profound learning” was necessarily understood
by ancient or medieval authors as an insinuation of magical knowledge.</p>
         <p>As I suggested above, however, <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> might
refer to the various forms of cryptography that involved transposing
letters but whose simple method nonetheless implied something far
more mysterious. Rendered literally as “weaving” or “woven”
letters, <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> links the “jumbling”
of letters with insinuations of magic. The idea that letters themselves
were the locus of mystical power was very familiar to Anglo-Saxons
not only through their runic legacy but through the conventional texts
that disseminated classical ideas about writing. Many strains of alphabet
mysticism derive from venerable Hellenistic and Judaic mystical traditions,
but aspects of these traditions had already been absorbed by grammar
and disseminated in Anglo-Saxon England by means of traditional grammar
books as well as the ubiquitous <italic>Etymologies</italic> of Isidore.
E. R. Curtius notes that Isidore's acceptance and transmission of “a
magico-mystical concept of the very elements of writing . . . was
of great moment for succeeding times.”67</p>
         <p>The synopsis of Latin grammar that constitutes book 1 of the <italic>Etymologies</italic> mingles grammatical, historical, and mythical
knowledge about letters, noting where different alphabets originated
and who invented them. Here, in the most influential of medieval encyclopedias,
we find, as Curtius suggests, clear if unsystematic evidence of mysticism.
The Egyptians, Isidore reports, had two kinds of writing: one for
common people and also “priestly letters” known in Greek
as sacred letters (<italic>Etym</italic>. 1.3.4). He also explains
how Pythagoras saw the letter <italic>upsilon</italic> as a “symbol
of human life” by decoding the symbolic purpose of each part
of the letter's shape. The Greeks had “five mystical letters,”
which included alpha and omega, “so that the Lord might show
himself in the movement from the beginning to the end, and the movement
of the end to the beginning” (<italic>Etym</italic>. 1.3.7–9).
These examples demonstrate the polysemous capacities of letters; they
signify linguistically by standing for sounds, but they also signify
symbolically according to their shape. In the case of Greek letters
their mystical capacity appears to derive from this symbolism, but
the symbolism of alpha and omega derives also from their position
in the alphabetical system so that alphabetical order becomes a cosmological
metaphor revealing the presence of God in a dialectic of divine time.
Thus, Isidore's sketches of alphabetical writing transmit the complexity
of letters as signs that overflow their phonetic function and that
can be “read” symbolically and ideographically. This kind
of reading is possible even for common letters of the Latin alphabet,
but it takes on mystic significance with regard to the specially designated
letters of Greek and, apparently, to distinct “sacred”
alphabets known only to priests. Isidore's “priestly letters”
presumably refer to the use of hieroglyphics, but they elicit comparison
to similar secret writing systems more familiar to Anglo-Saxons, like
the secret alphabet of Pachomius described by Jerome or the “strange
letters” of Aethicus Ister. While the former is mystical and
divinely sanctioned and the other is exotic and somewhat uncanny,
both suggest a concrete referent for <italic>gebregdstafas</italic>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
         <title>THE ALPHABETS OF PACHOMIUS AND AETHICUS</title>
         <p>Solomon was legendarily associated with alphabet magic. The <italic>Clavicula Salomonis</italic>, for example, a magical treatise attributed
to Solomon, composes incantations from “names of power”
and combinations of letters.68 As Joseph Dan explains, a “belief that the force within letters
of the Hebrew alphabet is the source of the creation of the cosmos”
is apparent in more conventional rabbinic literature, as well as in
the practices of mystics that depended on the divine significance
of numbers, names, and letters. These mystics used “a special
way of writing the Hebrew characters, intended to be secret and mystifying,
sometimes called the ‘alphabet of angels' or the ‘alphabet
of Metatron.’”69 Within the Christian tradition, the knowledge of a similar mystic
alphabet was imputed to the Egyptian abbot Pachomius. In the early
fourth-century Egypt of Pachomius, the boundaries between Christianity,
Gnosticism, and the Hellenistic-Jewish esotericism associated with
Alexandria were fluid.70 Although
Pachomius certainly rejected Gnosticism, and presumably also rejected
the more esoteric alphabetism associated with Gnostics, his use of
the Greek alphabet as the organizing principle at his own monastery—as
described in his monastic rule—is a key example of the “alphabetic
thinking” that shaped medieval grammatical discourse.71 Although no copy of Saint Jerome's
preface to his Latin translation of the <italic>Rule of St. Pachomius</italic> survives in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, the legend of Pachomius appears
to have been well known.72 Pachomius
is quite prominently figured in Anglo-Saxon art; his reception of
a divine message is depicted, for example, in the important Leofric
Missal. Just as his reception of divine knowledge of monastic origins
from an angel appears to be a moment of fascination to Anglo-Saxon
illustrators, so the esoteric reaches of late antique Judaism are
firmly echoed in apocryphal and pseudoepigraphical literature, especially
in the Book of Enoch's “the scribe of righteousness,”
which exercises well-attested influence in Anglo-Saxon culture.73</p>
         <p>The figure of Pachomius combines divinely inspired messages and
the knowledge of secret alphabets. The story of his reception of his
monastic rule is told in Gennadius's continuations to Jerome's <italic>De viris illustribus</italic> (ca. 392 CE). Gennadius reports that
Pachomius communicated with his bishops Cornelius and Cyrus “in
an alphabet concealed by mystic sacraments so as to surpass customary
human knowledge and only manifest to those of special grace or desert.”74 Gennadius's language reflects Jerome's
preface to his Latin translation of the Pachomian rule, where Jerome
explains that Pachomius and his associate bishops communicated <italic>per alphabetum speciale</italic>. Jerome's Latin construction mirrors
precisely <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic> 's <italic>þurh gebregdstafas</italic>. This is not to say that Jerome's
phrase exerted a direct influence on the native poem. It does, however,
demonstrate how we can understand the letters of <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> to be the instrument through which Solmon “unlocks”
the learning of the ancient world. Jerome's prior characterization
of Pachomius's knowledge of a divinely delivered <italic>linguae mysticae</italic> and the following description of the purpose of this “special
alphabet” to “[conceal] profound ideas with certain signs
and symbols” mystifies this alphabet, conflating the relatively
mundane capacity of encryption with the “secrecy” of divine
language.</p>
         <p>Byrhtferth of Ramsey gives a vernacular account of Pachomius's
divine inspiration in his <italic>Enchiridion</italic>, with the notable
difference that in Byrhtferth's version Pachomius receives a method
for calculating the Paschal feast rather than a monastic rule; he
received this Paschal rule in a message delivered by an angel and
written in “gyldenan stafas” (golden letters).75 The Leofric Missal illustrates
this divine transmission of Easter calculations, depicting Pachomius
beneath the giant hand of God that reaches down with a mnemonic verse
in multicolored letters written along the length of each finger. The
title on this folio describes the picture, how “the dextera
nam domini fulget cum floribus paschae” (God's right hand “shines”
with many colored letters)76 and might accurately be described in Old English as “bregdan
on bleom,”77 if the many
colors of the inscription on God's hand represent letters in the process
of shifting through a sequence of colors necessarily frozen by the
exigencies of art, rather than a set of letters each of which has
its own color.78 The meaning
of “sudden movement” attested by Old English <italic>gebregd</italic> and Old Norse <italic>bragð</italic> ultimately referred to “shining”
or a “bright brown” color.79 Among its many uses the verb <italic>gebregdan</italic> retained some vestige of this origin—the flash of a suddenly
drawn sword also recorded in <italic>Solomon</italic> 
            <italic>and
Saturn I</italic> (line 164; cf. “heorogrim hringmæl gebræd”
[<italic>Beowulf</italic>, line 1564]) or the flash of lightning described
in Ælfric's “Life of St. Thomas” (line 226).80 The colorful letters drawn on the
hand of God in this image are, in other words, a potential referent
for <italic>gebregdstafas</italic> : writing whose mysterious
power is signified by letters shining or shifting in color.</p>
         <p>The secret alphabet associated with Pachomius, and the shining
letters that signify divinely empowered writing, are positive models.
A second “secret alphabet” that piqued the curiosity of
learned Anglo-Saxons suggests an earthly, and perhaps more suspicious,
alternative. This alphabet, appearing in the eccentric <italic>Cosmographia</italic> of Aethicus Ister, stands out among the many alphabets found in
Anglo-Saxon manuscripts chiefly because of its enigmatic, fantastical
character.81 O'Brien O'Keeffe
has shown the connection between <italic>Solomon and Saturn II</italic> and the <italic>Cosmographia</italic>.82 Recent scholarship, furthermore, increasingly associates
the <italic>Cosmography</italic> with England: Michael Herren has
shown the extensive Greek influence in the Latin of Aethicus, and
Richard Pollard argues that this Greek influence and some specific
sources of the <italic>Cosmography</italic> connect Aethicus with
Theodore's Canterbury School, one of the only western centers where
Greek was likely to be known.83</p>
         <p>Toward the end of the eighth century, Koena, archbishop of York
(also known as Ælbert or Æthelbert) wrote a letter to
Lullus, the Anglo-Saxon archbishop of Mainz, who had inquired about
certain books. Lullus's letter has not survived, but Koena's reply
describes Aethicus's strange alphabet as <italic>litterae permolesta</italic> (most troublesome letters).84 The <italic>Cosmography</italic>, which claims to be a translation
by Jerome of a Greek treatise by an original Istrian author called
Aethicus, is well known to scholars as an elaborate literary fraud,
filled with difficult punning in Latin as well as a high proportion
of Grecisms and transparently owing a good deal of its geography to
other sources. The fraudulent author of the Aethicus treatise would
have seen Jerome as a convincing attribution for his work (given his
authority as a church father and also his fame as a translator of
the Bible), but this author perhaps also perceived Jerome to have
an interest in the mystical properties of writing that would lend
further credence to the “troublesome alphabet” that stood
out to Koena. That Jerome had such an interest may be gleaned from
his preface to the <italic>Rule of St. Pachomius</italic> as well
as from his correspondence and treatises explaining the meaning of
Hebrew letters.85 In the preface,
Jerome indicates that wherever he found evidence of Pachomius's secret
writings, he copied them down. To a learned reader who knew Jerome's
preface, the “secret alphabet” at the end of the pseudo-Jeromian
cosmography of Aethicus would certainly seem an example of this diligence.
The “secret alphabet” of Aethicus endured to pique the
interest of Hrabanus Maurus, who included it among the alphabets in
his <italic>De inventione linguarum</italic>.86 Hrabanus's interest in ciphers is famously manifest
in the encrypted poems of <italic>De laudibus sanctae crucis</italic>.87 These poems visually connect
the symbolism of letter forms and the mystical capacities of ciphers.
Such visual poems, which lay letters out in a grid pattern, are perhaps
another example of what “weaving letters” might be.</p>
         <p>Despite the title, which Wilhelm Levison suggests must be an error
for <italic>litterarum</italic>,88 Hrabanus's <italic>De inventione linguarum</italic> is in fact a
brief catalog explaining the origin of alphabets: from Hebrew and
Greek to cryptographic monograms and a rather fanciful runic alphabet “cum
quibus carmina sua incantationes que ac divinationes significare procurant
qui adhuc paganis ritibus involvuntur” (with which charms they
attempt to show their magic or predictions who are still involved
in pagan rites).89 Hrabanus
seems to have believed Aethicus to have been a real person, or he
saw fit to perpetuate the joke, when he provided biographical details
such as that the Istrian philosopher was of a noble family. Hrabanus
notes that Jerome has “magnificently and diligently explained”
these letters, but nonetheless at this point in his treatise Hrabanus
appears to grow nervous: he defends his inclusion of Aethicus's alphabet
by asserting that even Jerome wished to spread the knowledge of it
(“ideo et ejus litteras maluit promulgare”). Furthermore,
Hrabanus invites correction, if he has been led astray (“si
in istis adhuc litteris fallimur”).90 These were still to Hrabanus, as they were to Koena, “troublesome
letters.” Their shapes, familiar enough to be recognized as
letters and yet including complex curves reminiscent of astrological
symbols, seem to have left an uncanny impression.91</p>
         <p>Koena was Alcuin's teacher at York, Alcuin taught Hrabanus at Tours,
and Hrabanus in turn would eventually accede to Lullus's archepiscopal
see of Mainz. The shared offices and personal relationships between
these learned men suggest a clear path for the transmission of knowledge
about the Aethicus treatise, which we could imagine was more familiar
to them than its eccentricity suggests. Their responses to these “troublesome
letters,” like the legendary secret alphabet of Pachomius and
the letters shining forth on the hand of God, demonstrate an underlying
concern about the materiality of letters. Letters are “elements”
and bodies, and as such they are thoroughly and directly implicated
in a Christian discourse about the relationships between spirit and
matter.</p>
         <p>The complex semantic field associated with <italic>gebregstafas</italic> suggests that the literate Anglo-Saxon fascination with runes, exotic
alphabets, and cryptography results from seeing these forms of writing
as manifestations of the occult semiotic properties of all writing.
Like their ancient predecessors, learned Anglo-Saxons perceived in
writing the ability to make knowledge secret by transposing one thing
into another. This secrecy might be created by using encryption, by
jumbling or substituting letters, but it also evokes wariness in a
Christian discourse that stigmatized pagan erudition as a form of
deceit by associating it with the false transformations of magicians. <italic>Gebregdstafas</italic> refers simultaneously on abstract and concrete
levels. The compound refers to letters that are jumbled like secret
codes or that, like the demons of the poem, have shifting and untrustworthy
material forms. It also connotes a kind of deceit that is associated
at best with pagan literacy and at worst with the shape shifting of
demons—a deceit semantically rooted in rapid motion.</p>
         <p>Thinking of <italic>gebgregdstafas</italic> in this way, we can
see how <italic>Solomon and Saturn I</italic>, strange as it is, nonetheless
dramatizes the conventional cosmological tropes of grammar, taking
the idea that letters are both elements and bodies to a logical but
bizarre scene of animation. When Saturn claims in the opening lines
of the poem that he has unlocked the wisdom of the ancient world “þurh
gebregdstafas,” we can see his claim as something both more
concrete and more sinister than that suggested by the conventional
translation. It is not simply through his own “literary arts”
that Saturn understood these books but through a particular kind of
writing. Taken literally torefer to deceptive or dangerous letters,
this word suggests that Saturn “decrypted” his ancient
sources. The idea that these books “buried” their knowledge
in cryptic letters resonates with the verbs Saturn uses for reading, <italic>onbyrgan</italic> (to eat or consume) and <italic>onlūcan</italic> (to unlock), both of which are also metaphors of interring (in the
body) and revealing. Metaphorically, if not literally, the books he
studied were encrypted, magical, and dangerous. Solomon's response—to
describe the mystically empowered letters of the Pater Noster—suggests
he perceived Saturn's meaning, opposing his own legitimate form of
magically shifting letters to the mysterious alphabets of Saturn's
books.</p>
