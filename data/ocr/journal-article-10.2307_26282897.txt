The objective of this study was to the constant strain rate tests. characterize the head skin material of the Hybrid III test dummy for finite deformations and at moderate strain rates INTRODUCTION for blunt impact simulation using finite element models The Hybrid III anthropomorphic testing device (ATD or Head skin material from a single ATD was tested using dummy) has been widely used in automotive biomechanics uniaxial compression. A viscoelastic constitutive model with testing as a robust human surrogate for assessing the potential separable temporal and elastic responses was used to for human injury [1]. The dummy has also been utilized for characterize the nonlinear and viscoelastic material behavior. biomechanics research in sports injury [2] and military injury Model parameters were determined using data from a series [3-4]. Finite element models of the Hybrid III have been of relaxation tests up to 30% compressive strain (step developed to enable numerical simulation of motor vehicle displacement and hold for 60 s), and the model was validated accidents [5-6] and federal motor vehicle safety standards. using constant strain rate tests (up to 100% 1/s). Finite element dummy models are useful as they aregenerally less complex than human body models, and can be Rate dependence, hysteresis, and nonlinear elastic material validated experimentally with repeated tests. To produce behavior were seen during the testing. The results showed accurate Hybrid III simulation results over a range of input that the relaxation response of the material was strain scenarios, the model must use appropriate material properties independent up to 20% strain, with some strain-dependence that have been characterized over the wide range of strain and seen at the 30% strain level. A two-term Ogden hyperelastic strain rates that the dummy will experience during an impact model was used for the instantaneous elastic function, and a or event. In this regard, the properties of skin materials play  1  8  6     SAE Int. J. Mater.

Accordingly, simulation of this impact requires EXPERIMENTAL SETUP material properties derived from experimental data encompassing this regime of loading. Cylindrical samples from a newly manufactured Hybrid IIIhead skin (Denton ATD, Rochester Hills, MI) were cut from Viscoelastic material testing of rubbers may be performed both lateral aspects of the head using a 0.5 inch diameter using tension [7-8], compression [9-10] and shear [11] rubber punch mounted in a press. The samples were cut loading. Indentation testing coupled with finite element slowly with minimal force to minimize compression of the analysis has also been used to determine viscoelastic behavior material [22]. Nine samples with a length/diameter ratio of [12]. To determine the viscoelastic behavior of the rubber one were chosen for testing, with four samples taken from the skin material, compression loading was chosen. A common left side of the head and five taken from the right side. Viable method for compression testing of rubber is testing a sample area on the head skin from which consistent samples could be between two flat platens and using a prescribed compressive taken was limited by the surface curvature. Each sample was displacement while measuring the force generated by the measured using digital calipers to determine the height and compression [13-14]. In this setup, the end conditions of the the diameter of the sample, with the diameter measured at a sample have an effect on the stress distribution in the sample midlevel between the top and bottom surfaces.

It has been shown in standard deviation (SD) of the sample height (l0) and sample Hybrid III head test applications, such as head drop, that diameter (D0) were 10.55 mm ± 0.62 and 9.97 mm ± 0.18, surface treatment with lubricants has significant influence of respectively.

Minimal thickness of time-dependent materials such as rubber and biological of lubrication was used to avoid contribution to the overall tissue [17]. Integral-type viscoelastic models are commonly height of the sample. used as they can be easy to implement for complex loading and nonlinear behavior materials [18-19]. Quasi-linear Samples were compressed using displacement control. viscoelasticity (QLV) is a common viscoelastic theory used Displacement inputs were based upon engineering strain as to characterize biological materials and polymers that have defined by the ratio of change in height (Δl) to the initial nonlinear elastic responses, as it reduces constitutive model height (l0) of the sample. Zero strain was defined by the complexity by separating the nonlinear elastic response from height of the sample under a 1N initial load. This initial load a linear temporal response [17, 20]. A fully nonlinear was to ensure the proper contact of the bottom and top viscoelastic model, where the elastic and temporal responses surfaces of the sample without substantial displacement from cannot be considered independent, can be considerably more its initial unstressed height.

Importantly, the material shows no values 100s, 10s, 1s, 100ms, and 10 ms [23]. The convolution progressive decrease in stress-time response with number of integral, Eq. (1), was numerically integrated in terms of tests, ensuring that no material damage occurred up to this instantaneous elastic parameters, and relaxation coefficients strain level. [24]. This technique allowed for the evaluation of the convolution integral using an arbitrary displacement input based on displacement time-history of each test rather than a idealized step-hold displacement [24]. A generalized reduced gradient technique was used to find an optimal solution for instantaneous elastic parameters and the relaxation coefficients (Excel Solver, Microsoft). Reduced relaxation coefficients and instantaneous elastic function parameters were simultaneously optimized by minimizing the sum of the squared errors for all 54 step-hold tests together. Multiple hyperelastic models were considered for the instantaneous elastic function, including Neo- Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, 1-term Ogden, and 2-term Ogden models. The functional forms of each of the hyperelastic models in uniaxial compression are shown in Table 1 in order  1  8  8     SAE Int. J. Mater.

A nonlinear validated for strains up to 30% and strain rates varying from viscoelastic model with dependent temporal and strain 0.1 to 100% 1/s.

The resulting validation shows that The reduced relaxation function for the step-hold test data within the strain rate and level constraints of the model, had larger coefficients for the 10 and 100 ms time-constants, Hybrid III head skin can be accurately characterized using suggesting that these short time-constants are important for linear viscoelasticity with a nonlinear instantaneous elastic modeling the Hybrid III head skin in blunt impact. The function, Ogden hyperelasticity. instantaneous elastic function represents the nonlinear elastic behavior of the material, and a hyperelastic constitutive model was an ideal method for representing this behavior. NOTATION Use of these hyperelastic models carries the assumption that the material is isotropic and incompressible, which rubbers l0 are generally considered [27]. Note that both the Neo- initial sample height Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic models are a subset of the Ogden model, so it was expected that the D0 increase in model generalization would result in an improved sample diameter fit to the data. Additionally, this model can only be considered validated for Δl unconfined compression. Shear and tension tests were not change in sample height done on this material, so the model could not be evaluated under these types of load. However, the general mode of σ(λ,t) loading on the Hybrid III head skin material during blunt stress response impact would be compression, so characterizing the shear and tensile behavior of the material may not be necessary for many blunt impact scenarios. Gred reduced relaxation function Other factors to consider when testing rubber materials include testing temperature and material age. The temperature σeof the material during this study was not monitored, but all testing was carried out in a temperature controlled lab at instantaneous elastic function room temperature. Previous work has shown that material behavior can change significantly over varied temperature λ [29-30]. However, this behavior change occurs over a much stretch larger temperature interval, approximately 50°C, than the temperature range of this study. Experimental work has also SAE Int. J. Mater.
