<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Woman Problem Gender Displacement in the Art of Helen Frankenthaler By Bett Schumacher Most American maintains of the that painter important the critical Helen recent reception Frankenthaler scholarship of her work (b. on 1928) in the the American painter Helen Frankenthaler (b. 1928) maintains that the critical reception of her work in the 1950s and 1960s was acutely gendered. These were crucial years for the development of Frankenthaler's art. During this time she developed her signature "soak-stain" painting method, by which thinned paint is soaked and spread into unprimed canvas laid on the floor. This period also witnessed some of her greatest critical success. However, scholars today hold that contemporary critics, whether praising or disparaging Frankenthaler's abstract canvases, always found them "appropriate." Whether lyrical, delicate, erotic, or hysterical, the painting was always clearly a woman's handiwork.1 Indeed, several early critics noted Frankenthaler's gender in their reviews. Writing in 1966 for Art News, B. H. Friedman called Frankenthaler's soak-stain technique "free, lyrical, and feminine," and her color palette "seductive and feminine." He also recognized a "sexual analogy" in the artist's bodily painting process.2 Several years earlier, the poet and critic James Schuyler had remembered a "sensibility altogether feminine" in the nineteen paintings, all done between 1951-52 and 1959, that comprised Frankenthaler's 1960 retrospective exhibition at New York City's Jewish Museum.3 Moreover, in a ranting review of that 1960 retrospective, which triggered an angry response from Art News readers, Anne Seelye wrote about Frankenthaler's 1950s oeuvre, including such paintings as Giralda (1956) and Trojan Gates (1955; Fig. 1): One cannot be satisfied only to look for the sudden, surprising visual beauties; one is in the presence of an hysterical temperament, and must take account of that. There are women who wish they had these qualities, and there are men who wish they might fall in love, tragically, with that personality. The paintings are romantic, hypersensitive, sulky, and filled with surface tensions.4 It would seem, then, that gender was indeed a principal lens through which Frankenthaler's early audiences regarded her work. They judged it to be feminized in almost every imaginable category: color, form, effect on the viewer, and proximity to its maker. Yet Helen Frankenthaler herself has been famously skeptical about the role an artist's gender should play in the Fig. 1. Helen Frankenthaler, Trojan Gates (1955), oil on canvas, 72" X 48 7/8".

As she told Henry Geldzahler at the time, Looking at my paintings as if they were by a woman is superficial, a side issue, like looking at Klines and saying they are bohemian. The making of serious paintings is difficult and complicated for all serious painters. One must be oneself, whatever.5 ф WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2.

For Frankenthaler, analyzing a work of art exclusively in gendered terms detracts from its intentionality and seriousness. Of course she acknowledges that gender might be an issue that complicates her painting: "one must be oneself." Being a woman is something over which she has no control, but it may well affect her art. It is not, however, something she actively cultivates in paint or foregrounds in her art. Rather, Frankenthaler views "femaleness" as neither a positive nor a productive aesthetic category. Perhaps this resistance is hard to understand more than thirty-five years after Linda Nochlin asked, "Why have there been no great women artists?"6 Today many women artists routinely embrace and explore gender in their work, and gender theory is an established method of art historical analysis. But remembering the time and the place in which Frankenthaler made her disavowal - the infamously masculinized New York art world of the 1950s and 1960s - what happens if we decide to take that disavowal seriously? What more can we discover about the work if we respect - and attempt to examine - her ambivalence about being a woman painter? What more can we learn if we investigate how the artist thought through this vexing issue in and through her art-making? How has Frankenthaler supplemented, or even attempted to displace, the particular, individual presence of the artist - including, logically, her femininity - with a broader evocation of subjectivity with which a viewer of either gender could identify? I believe that this supplementation or substitution of the embodied subjectivity of the beholder in relation to the embodied subjectivity of the painter required Frankenthaler to first address and, in turn, to displace femininity as a dimension of the presence of her person in the context of her art. By looking at the degree to which critics intuited these procedures within the canvases themselves, I hope to demonstrate that Frankenthaler's critical reception was more complicated than recent scholarship would have us believe. Griselda Pollock has argued that in the 1950s, the American modernist artist who happened to be a woman faced a difficult challenge.7 Modernist abstraction seemed to offer a promise of objectivity whereby one's gender would not factor into the creation and reception of a work of art. But, in fact, any artist staking out her own space within modernism - determining how to make work that was special and different - had to muster all the conditions of her individuality as fodder for her art. As Frankenthaler herself described it, "every fact of one's reality is in one's work: age, height, weight, history, nationality, religion, sex, pains, habits, attractions."8 Yet at the same time, this artist had to avoid being labeled a "woman artist" (which, according to Pollock, "means no artist at all" 9). She had to avoid making art that evinced "femininity," and instead pursue what would make her different, what would make her modernism unique without reflecting her gender difference.10 Thus Frankenthaler would conclude her thoughts on how the self factored into her painting by declaring that, "being female is one of many in this long list for me, but has never been a specific issue by itself. What you call 'female quality' is a serious fact that I enjoy, and part of a total working picture."11 Borrowing from Carol Duncan's scholarship, Pollock asserts that in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, modern art was being masculinized in terms of its FALL / WINTER 2010 ф</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3.

Photo by Ernst Haas/Hulton Archive/Getty Images. methods, representations, and self-conception.12 A sexual hierarchy was mapped onto artistic practice and embodied in the trope of the artist in his studio. At the top of the hierarchy was the artist, the active male mind and body at work. In the middle was the object, the canvas waiting to be inscribed. At the bottom was the "other": the muse that inspires the artist preparing to mark the canvas. "That from which art is made because art is other to it" was femininity, or nature, as personified by the nude female model in the studio.13 Thus the role of the female body in artistic production was passive. Male genius and the male painting body were needed to activate it. By the mid-twentieth-century, Pollock claims, some of the terms in this conception of modern art had changed, but women and femininity still constituted the "other." Femininity had become associated not with nature but with artificiality: e.g., make-up, hair dye, and the celluloid sex symbol, and the conception of masculinity had evolved as well, so that masculinity and femininity remained opposites: men were "natural" by comparison to painted women. The foil for the sex symbol was the serious, esteemed, "naturally" gifted male "method" actor.14 Within art-making, terms had changed too. The nude female in the studio had all but disappeared as abstraction took the vanguard. Instead of looking to the female model for inspiration, the Abstract Expressionist artist, as personified by Jackson Pollock, engaged in painterly dialogue with the horizontal blank canvas. The cotton duck supplanted, or even subsumed, the nude female body in the studio. Displacing the female body as the vessel for male artistic desire and the stuff of artistic inspiration, the canvas, according to Griselda Pollock, became the object for the artist to master.15 But what of the woman who wanted to occupy the studio and make art? How did the woman artist envision the feminine "other" she needed to make art against and through? How could she occupy the place of the active quasi-masculine painter? In an era when popular culture portrayed the ultimate woman as a sex symbol, and the quintessential artist as an ultra-masculine "action painter," how did a woman artist define herself?16 Griselda Pollock argues that the American woman artist at mid-century attempted to solve these problems by envisioning a new "third term" within the conventional dyad of (masculine) painter and (feminine) muse.17 Pollock calls this discrete psychic presence the "creative woman's body."18 During this period, she posits, the creative woman's body was an imagined body onto which women artists could project their femininity; the fantasy of the creative woman's body became the receptacle for the female artist's gender identity. This psychic "body" allowed the "body" in the canvas to seem neutered, and the painter's body outside the canvas to be invested with all the authority modernism usually grants men.19 Griselda Pollock identifies Frankenthaler as one of the women artists of the 1950s who was able to displace her femininity onto a creative woman's body. To demonstrate how Frankenthaler's activity suggests "a profoundly different way of being in the body"20 than Jackson Pollock's, she compares photographs of Frankenthaler painting in 1969 (Fig. 2), taken by the photographer Ernst Haas, with Hans Namuth's famous shots of Jackson Pollock at work in 1950. Griselda Pollock observes Frankenthaler entering, kneeling, and sitting upon the canvases and using "pouring, pushing, smoothing gestures."21 By contrast, she sees Jackson Pollock dominating his canvases, towering over them and practically assaulting them with a paint-covered stick.22 She concludes that by adopting a version of Jackson Pollock's physical painting process, Frankenthaler placed herself at the apex of the sexual hierarchy that was typically occupied by a male body. At the same time, the modifications she made to his process - substituting smoothing for flinging, and relation for dominance - also suggest that Frankenthaler considered the painting as a continuation of her own space, and therefore that she was sensitive to the relation of her own (female) body to the cotton duck on the floor, the "body of canvas" that, in Griselda Pollock's terms, conjures up the "feminine" body of the "other." By failing to see the force fulness of Frankenthaler's presence to her canvases, Griselda Pollock thus misses the real lesson of the Haas photographs. The artist does not merely sit and smooth. Her activity is much more athletic, her painting method even more physical and vigorous than Jackson Pollock's. Another 1969 photo by Haas (Fig 3), for example, shows Frankenthaler on tip-toe, leaning into her canvas, supporting the weight of her body with one arm while she extends the other as far as she can to make a mark. Her remarkable physical strength allows her to hold her body close to the canvas while remaining just outside of it. I believe that while the Haas photographs indeed suggest that Frankenthaler envisioned something like a creative woman's body for her practice, they do not do so by evoking an essentialist relation of woman painter to canvas, as Griselda Pollock maintains. Rather, the photographs indicate the presence of something like a creative woman's body in the way they reveal to us the ambiguity of Frankenthaler's bodily relation to her work. Thus, while I see value in Griselda Pollock's concept of the "creative woman's body" as situated in relation both to 0 WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4 (left).

Anonymous Gift BMA 1966.54. women artists' own femininity and to the corporeality evoked in the painting of others, both male and female, I disagree with Pollock's specific claims for Frankenthaler, above all in their fixity - their failure to account for variations, ambiguities, and identification in both the production and reception of her work. Additionally, in contrast to Pollock's suggestion that Frankenthaler's painting is a meditation on differentiation which happens psychically through procedures of identification, I see that engagement with differentiation happening within Frankenthaler's paintings themselves.23 For example, Frankenthaler's monumental painting Madridscape (Fig. 4 and Pis. 4, 4A, 4B) can be construed to explore a relationship between the body within the canvas and the body or bodies outside the canvas (the painter's body, and, to appropriate Pollock's language, the third term of the "creative woman's body"). In juxtaposing these real and imagined bodies, Frankenthaler suggests that she does indeed intuit differences among them. A large oil, about nine by thirteen feet, Madridscape was painted, as John Elderfield documents, as a "recapitulation" of the trip to Spain Frankenthaler took with Robert Motherwell in the summer of 1958.24 It also reworks a smaller mixed-media work on paper of the same title that she made while a guest at the Madrid Ritz. The massive painting is divided into three vertical registers. The left- and rightmost columns are topped by blue arches, the middle column by a green arch; all three recall the Spanish architecture that Frankenthaler likely saw during her trip. Reinforcing the impression of a Spanish cityscape shaped in part by Moorish influences is the presence of a blue-outlined, dome-like shape in the painting's left section. The three arches capping each of the three vertical registers contribute to a palpable sense of "surrounding" or "enfolding" in Madridscape . The blue and green arches merge with rounded ochre lines at the bottom left and along the right edge and bottom of the painting to effect an ovoid composition. Fig. 5 (below). Helen Frankenthaler, Seven Types of Ambiguity (1957), oil on canvas, 95 1/2" x 70 1/8". Private collection. A smaller ring shape is formed by the connection of the three arches to the three caryatid-like shapes that occupy the center and right columns of the painting. (Within the context of a columnar composition, the figurai shapes call to mind FALL /WINTER 2010 ф</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 6. Helen Frankenthaler, Basque Beach (1958), oil on canvas, 58 5/8" x 69 5/8". Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. Gift of Joseph H. Hirshhorn, 1966. anthropomorphic pillars.) Here I am referring to the washy, dark, anthropomorphic shape at right, the ochre figure with red "hair" in the center, and the outlined suggestion of a figure to their left. All three, backs turned and clasped hands raised, reach out to touch the blue and green arches that then recede into space. The grouping evokes something like a football huddle or a game of ring-around-the-rosy, in the context of which the circle of figures would spin. (The group would rotate around the tiny blue building-like shape with the pointed "rooftop-tower" that occupies the picture's center-point.) Moreover, a third compositional ring is suggested by the juxtaposition of the figures to the horizontal red swoosh that sails out of the red splattered "mountain peak" shape drawn just under the green arch. The swoosh heads right, thickening into a red wedge that runs into the "throat" of the washy brownish-black figure. The swoosh and the figures together form a third, tighter, innermost ring. This circle, then, is circumscribed by the ring suggested by the touch of raised arm to arch, and also set within the flat ovoid on the surface of the canvas. Madridscape is thus composed of a series of increasingly tight encirclements set on different axes. This sense of surrounding or enfolding reaches out to encompass the beholder. Though the three figure-like shapes appear to be facing away from us, the logic of the composition, and its scale, suggest that we might slip underneath a raised arm and join their spinning circle. If anything, these figures seen from the back do not so much shut us out from the composition as mirror our position in front of the canvas. In this way they become stand-ins for us, anticipating our imagined entrance into the painting. The same kind of anthropomorphic figures can be found in Seven Types of Ambiguity (19 57; Fig.4), in the figure outlined in red in the left-hand side of the painting, and in Basque Beach (1958; Fig. 5), in the three stooped figures who seem to walk across the canvas in the distance, heading right.25 Such "entrance" is also thematized in Madridscape , albeit differently, by the footprints littering the composition. As Frankenthaler trod across the canvas, her shoes left numerous impressions, many of them dusty or paint-splotched. Anne M. Wagner has written about incidental body marks like these in Frankenthaler's work - footprints scattered in the lower left-hand corner of Seven Types of Ambiguity , a body print (left, perhaps, by the artist's hip or knee) "blooming" in the lower right-hand corner of Mountains and Sea (1952; Pis. 5, 5A).2h For Wagner, these marks record the artist's "accidental presence" to the canvas, but, importantly, they do not constitute part of the picture within the canvas. 27 They mark but one instance of Frankenthaler's presence to the canvas: her working body. Other types of presence include her creative mind, evoked by the pictorial scene she creates within the depths of the canvas; and her critical mind, her emergence from the pictorial depths in order to evaluate her mark, evoked by those painterly marks that seem more deliberately surface-oriented.28 In Madridscape , however, I believe that Frankenthaler does contemplate and indeed does figure her working body within the painted scene. Moreover, she considers and evokes the relation that body has to the other bodily ways she is present to her painting. Accompanying the footprints made by the painter's body (to use Griselda Pollock's term for the masculinized artistic progenitor) is a greenish gray depiction of a footprint applied on top of the red swoosh in the right-hand column of the picture (PI. 4A). The print cannot have resulted from Frankenthaler actually tracking paint she stepped in across the canvas, for only the heel is solid green. The rest of the sole is simply outlined. "Real" footprints intrude into the space all around the painted print, reinforcing the sense of the painted print as a footprint, but also inviting the viewer to recognize its difference from those that surround it. Just as a real footprint marks the presence of the painter's body to the canvas, a painted footprint also invites us to imagine a body walking on the surface. This artificial presence was made as a representation and not a trace, by her painting hand, not her stepping foot, and thus this painted footprint can be imagined as something like the mark left by the "creative woman's body." The creative woman's body, as Pollock theorizes, is a productive but artificial construct that mediates the contradictory ways masculinity and femininity are usually allowed in painting. Similarly, the painted footprint is an artificial go-between for the dusty footprint of the painter's body and another kind of mark that appears in Madridscape : the mark of the subsumed feminine "other." Near the center of the painting, above and to the left of the blue building shape, are a number of subtle red marks (PI. 4B) ф WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 7. Helen Frankenthaler, Eden (1956), oil on canvas, 103" x 117". Private collection. (I count thirteen). These are traces of the fronts and the backs of Frankenthaler's fingers. It appears that the artist dipped her hand into red pigment and rolled it on the surface of the canvas, as we can see fingerprints as well as the outline of a small nail bed. These traces of a hand, nail-side-up, recreate the hand of the painter marking the surface. Yet the finger traces, pad-side-up, suggest a body subsumed within the painting (an impression that Madridscape' s circular, enfolding composition reinforces). Upon noticing the second kind of fingerprints, we imagine a body beneath the surface, reaching its palms up, an impression that we also get from Frankenthaler's Eden (1956; Fig 7), in which a robust orange shape near the top right-hand corner calls to mind an upheld five-fingered hand.29 Of course, in the actual moment these marks were laid down on Madridscape , their orientations were reversed. The impression of Frankenthaler's nail bed is the result of her pressing the back of her hand on the canvas, and the fingerprints of pressing down her palm. In this way Frankenthaler indicates some of the complexity of her bodily presence to the canvas. On the one hand, she marks from above with the body of the painter. On the other, she reaches as if from the depths, as if imbricated, that is, in the canvas in which her painted "figures" appear. (The fact that the marks actually trace a reversed orientation of artist to canvas underscores the convoluted relation these embodiments bear to one another.) Thus the artist imagines what it would be like not only to walk on the canvas and mark its surface as its creator, but also to be subsumed within the canvas - specifically, to be a subsumed body, one whose mark-making is manifested as the traces of patterns inscribed in skin. Referring once again to Griselda Pollock, we might say that Frankenthaler envisions herself as encompassing both the feminine body of the "other" concealed within the Abstract Expressionist picture, and the painter's body that produced such pictures.

Certainly, these handprints are small moments within a very large painting. Nevertheless, they establish at the very least that the artist paused during the pictorial action to consider different ways her body related to her work. We can imagine Frankenthaler accidentally spilling red paint on her hand, or inadvertently touching a paint-covered finger to the canvas and becoming curious enough to pursue the possibilities proposed by such an accident - perhaps kneeling or squatting and touching her hand to the canvas: once, twice, FALL /WINTER 2010 ф</page><page sequence="7">then turning it over and pressing it again against the cotton duck. The significance for the painting comes from her decision to leave the marks, near the heart of the painting, rather than to obliterate or reconfigure them. The handprints thus become implicated within the pictorial action in a way that dusty footprints or knee or hip indentations do not. The red fingers demonstrate that, at least this once, the artist actively contemplated the different ways her painting was embodied. In Madridscape , then, we see Frankenthaler contemplating her own discrete bodily orientations to the canvas. In Griselda Pollock's terms, she displaces her femaleness onto a fantasized third term body, leaving the canvas and the painter gender-free. As mentioned earlier, many of today's scholars hold that critics in the fifties and sixties routinely characterized Frankenthaler's painting as unambiguously feminine. Actually, the critical response was often more complicated than that. Many who saw Frankenthaler's femininity implicated in the canvases also perceived artistic strength and bravery. And as James Schuyler intuited a "feminine sensibility" in Frankenthaler's 1960 Jewish Museum retrospective, he also acknowledged that it had taken a "special courage" on the part of the artist to calm the "think- tough and paint-tough grain of New York School abstract painting." Schuyler also took pains to emphasize that Frankenthaler's paler beauty was not "weak."30 Other critics also identified bravery, ruggedness, and even braggadocio in Frankenthaler's painting. Writing in December 1951 about her first solo exhibition, a show at New York's Tibor de Nagy Gallery that included such canvases as Painted on 21st Street (1950-51) and The Jugglers (1951), Paul Brach described the young artist as "imaginative, fearless, and immensely talented."31 Likewise, in his review of Frankenthaler's January 1958 solo show at de Nagy, Parker Tyler recognized Frankenthaler's "hand and eye" as "explorative in the most urgent 'wilderness' sense." 32 As Anne M. Wagner has noted, two years earlier Tyler had unmistakably likened the forms within and effects of paintings such as the explosive Blue Territory (1955; Fig. 8) to male physiology: Helen Frankenthaler returns [to de Nagy] this year with canvases drenched with her fervor for painterliness, and none of the younger artists has a more immediate feeling for paint itself to make this fervor authentic. Her courage is worth a double-take; she can make the paint-mass spurt like a leak in a dike and yet control it till it laps the canvas like a spent wave. She has as free a curve and spontaneous a thrust as Pollock, and a stretch of outsize canvas is like a dare to her. 33 What is more, rather than seeing mere pictorial femininity, or at the very least in addition to pictorial femininity, many of Frankenthaler's (mostly male) critics apparently saw themselves. Their reviews paint Frankenthaler's pictures as discrete entities that somehow mirrored the critics' own subjectivities back to them. For example, just as Parker Tyler clearly perceived the operations of his own male body in Frankenthaler's pictorial procedures, James Schuyler, writing about her 1957 show at de Nagy, saw his own experiences in the work on view, which included such monumental soak- stain canvases as Lorelei (1956, Fig. 9): To sum up at the beginning: it is in work of this quality that the continuity of free abstract painting, the kind particularly associated with Jackson Pollock, is found: working directly with the medium, not from motifs or sketches; variety of handling; getting what is inside outside, where it can be evaluated, worked on further, or left alone: the liberation and control of having painted and being a painter; the fact of being one among many with something special to paint that others have seen and experienced (Helen Frankenthaler does not paint in Pollock's shadow; that would be a misapprehension).34 Schuyler clearly recognized Frankenthaler's painterly exploration of freedom and control. He also observed her effort to paint intuitively and subjectively (to paint what is "inside" her) while subjecting that interiority to analysis and criticism, if warranted. Furthermore, he pronounces that she is capable of painting that which "others have seen and experienced." Here Schuyler can be understood to imply, on the one hand, that Frankenthaler's pictures remind us of events from our own lives, but, on the other hand, and perhaps more profoundly, that her paintings depict the memories and feelings of others, the inner states of others (in addition, of course, to her own). After seeing Frankenthaler's 1954 show at the de Nagy Gallery, which included such works as Plateau , The Desert , and Passport , Frank O'Hara concurred that she let "the truth stand forth plainly and of itself... In all of these paintings there is an original use of the artistic temper, a disdain of appearances, and sometimes a private unpleasantness of tenor which is made beautiful by its unimpeded self-assertion - which is to say that then the artist disappears and we have a fact of experience."35 In other words, the paintings were not mediated depictions of personal, individual experience or feeling - experience or feeling filtered through the artist's subjectivity. For O'Hara, Frankenthaler was somehow able to make herself disappear in order to show us our own, as it were, universal experience. Martica Sawin, reviewing the same 1954 de Nagy show, similarly saw Frankenthaler suppressing her own subjectivity, the better to model ours: Nothing intrudes in this laconic work between the observer and the paint, no odious trace of an idea, no superfluous painterliness; we are free to respond wholly to the unadulterated intensity of the artist's emotion, or to follow the fancies of our own imaginations in inventing meanings and explanations, to be as subjective as we like, for this art is as yet beyond the reach of objectivity.36 Viewers could choose to consider either the painter's emotional states as evoked in the canvases or their own. When ф WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="8">Sawin concluded that there was "no odious trace of an idea" in the painting, she was not claiming that the work is unintelligent but rather that it does not contain objective themes that might distract from observers contemplation of their own experience of the painting and, by extension, of their own imagination and subjectivity.37 Schuyler, O'Hara and Sawin, then, each describe how Frankenthaler 's work seems to delve into the beholder's subjectivity, even if that beholder happened to be male. Thus, despite what much of today's scholarship contends, several of Frankenthaler's most thoughtful critics did not deem her painting essentially feminine; for them, it did not immediately conjure up the painter's female body. To the contrary, Tyler, O'Hara, Schuyler, Sawin and others proposed that the presence of the artist was minimized in her work. They saw paintings that evoked subjectivity more broadly, that encouraged intimately engaged viewers to invest them with their own feelings. Reviewing Frankenthaler's Jewish Museum retrospective for Arts Magazine, Donald Judd also perceived subjectivity in Frankenthaler's body of work. He considered the nineteen canvases on view, all but one of which were soak-stain paintings, clearly inspired by Pollock's Duco enamel paintings of 1951-52.38 But he believed her work departed from Pollock's in its "massed ambience and warmth," and its rejection of rigid frontality.39 Judd's opinion of Frankenthaler was largely positive. He notes that "Frankenthaler's [different] purpose" is "certainly as valid as Pollock' s"; but he worries about whether Frankenthaler has given herself room to move forward. Pollock, he says, combines his canvases' many parts into one statement, resulting in an evenness of surface that is "cool," or objective, and that discourages a beholder from trying to penetrate it. By contrast, he believes that Frankenthaler's ambiguous space and scattered pockets of figuration or near figuration cause divisions that suggest something utterly subjective, like the compartments of the mind or the layers of the psyche. For Judd, the painting thus embodies the artist's "unique theory of the imagination" whereby reality is a "disparate collection." Taking Judd's analysis a step further, it follows that Frankenthaler's segmented canvases also call for a viewer who vigorously interacts with the work: selecting, sorting, juxtaposing. The implication seems clear that the psyche the painting depicts, because iťs the psyche the painting engages, is the viewer's own. Beginning in the early 1950s, Frankenthaler's critics consistently described her painting as ambitiously, and productively, ambiguous. They also understood that this degree of pictorial ambiguity necessitated an active beholder. Critic after critic pronounced her canvases nearly impossible to fix in the mind. For example, reviewing Frankenthaler's first solo exhibition in 1951, Paul Brach observed that her forms appeared to hang momentarily, almost readable as "symbols," or figuration, before they were "whisked away," to sink back into ground.40 In other words, aspects of Frankenthaler's painting shifted between figure and ground, and again Fig. 9. Helen Frankenthaler, Lorelei (1956), oil on canvas, 70 5/8" x 86 3/4". The Brooklyn Museum, 58.39. Gift of Allan D. Emil. between abstraction and representation. Her technique encouraged these multiple readings. The soak-stain permanently embeds paint into the canvas ground, creating a literal flatness. Yet, as John Elderfield explained about Frankenthaler's most famous soak-stain painting, Mountains and Sea (PL 5), space is opened up in the ostensibly flat composition through the use of transparent pigment and the juxtaposition of warm and cool colors.41 Frankenthaler once characterized cubist space as "miles away but simultaneously right smack up front;" the description is just as appropriate for her own pictorial space.42 Given Frankenthaler's conflicted feelings about the role of gender in her work, and bearing in mind the milieu in which she painted, I see this sustained exploration of pictorial difference as, metaphorically, also a meditation on gender difference. Crucially, for a woman artist working in New York in the 1950s and early 1960s, any contemplation of gender difference had to be subtle to avoid risking being discounted as a serious artist. Materializing difference in pictorial ambiguity was less risky insofar as the painting's gendered implications were veiled. Though her painting contemplated opposition, juxtaposition, and identification, Frankenthaler's work could not be dismissed as "woman's art" on the grounds that it explored difference in specifically gendered terms. Ultimately, Frankenthaler was attempting to "think through" femininity in her art - to overcome her gender, seeking to replace her female / feminized presence with a gender neutral one, as Griselda Pollock argues. By actively engaging her beholder with pictorially ambiguous effects, as well as segmented compositions that must be read piecemeal, she extricated herself from her canvases, leaving only the viewer him- or herself, as many of the period's most astute art critics intuited. Attempting to eradicate gender is still engaging it, and her protests notwithstanding, being a FALL /WINTER 2010 ф</page><page sequence="9">woman mattered to Frankenthaler's art. However, as she acknowledged, it was just one element in a long list, though it was the first, perhaps - the thing to move through and beyond. Frankenthaler's attitudes toward her sex and her art may not conform to our thinking about gender today. But if we read the green painted footprint in Madridscape as indeed the ghostly trace of a woman caught up in the 1950s New York art scene, we have an opportunity to walk in Frankenthaler's shoes. We can imagine her trying to send gender stereotypes marching, as surely as that green footprint treads across the canvas. Frankenthaler fervently wanted to avoid the traditional roles permitted women in the studio - nude model, muse - even if, in the end, she had to banish part of herself to succeed. • Bett Schumacher was director of the Richard Reynolds Gallery at University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, from 2007- 2010.

Schuyler compared the "feminine sensibility" he saw in Frankenthaler's retrospective at the Jewish Museum (Jan. 26 - Mar. 2, 1960) with the "remarkable shift" he saw in her new work at the André Emmerich Gallery (Mar. 28 - Apr. 23, 1960). In her new work, Schuyler saw more vivid color and form that seemed less improvisational, both of which implied a "new certainty." 4. A[nne] S[eelye], "Helen Frankenthaler," Art News (Mar. 1960): 39, 57-58. Seelye's review of Frankenthaler's retrospective show at the Jewish Museum occasioned an outpouring of outrage by Art News readers. The April and May issues of the magazine, the first two to follow Seelye's March notice, published several examples of the many angry letters the editor had received. These writers seethed that Seelye's attack was inappropriate in its methods and wrong in its conclusions. The review was called "inept," "disgusting," "glorified dribble," a "gross insult," and an "unwarranted invasion of the artist's right of privacy." Seelye was chastised for her blindness, her vindictiveness, and an "excessive lack of taste." See "Editor's Letters," Art News (Apr. 1960): 10; (May 1960): 6. 5.

They had to make a space within which to make a difference, to make their own particular difference, which resulted from the whole complex of who each one of them was, while endlessly dodging the curatorial sniffing out of what would be deadly to their desire for recognition, the contaminating signs of a disqualifying 'femininity.'" 11.

The critic Harold Rosenberg introduced his interpretation of New York School painting as "action painting" in Art News in 1952. Rosenberg understood the artists of the New York School, in particular Jackson Pollock, whose physical painting style had by then been documented in publications such as Life magazine, to consider the canvas "as an arena in which to act - rather than as a space in which to reproduce, re-design, analyze, or 'express' an object." Rosenberg thus reasoned that what a New York School artist such as Pollock produced "was not a picture but an event." See "The American Action Painters," in David Shapiro and Cecile Shapiro, eds., Abstract Expressionism: A Critical Record (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990), 76. That "event," then, was not the making of a painting, but more a creative or originative act that materialized the emotional and intellectual energy of the painter. A primary difficulty of Rosenberg's account is that it casts the painting itself as something of an artifact of the painter's revelatory act. The interpretation thus seems to diminish the work of art in its attempt to theorize and valorize the artistic process. 17. Pollock, "Killing Men and Dying Women," 242. 18. Ibid., 242, 244. 19.

The ambiguity and juxtaposition of oppositions in the pictures are themselves contemplations and enactments of difference and differentiation. Moreover, difference motivates Frankenthaler's vision of her work as connecting discrete entities, the viewer and the painting, the subject and the world. (As much as the consonance between these entities matters, so too does their inherent distinctness from one another. If the entities were not distinct, then there would be nothing much of interest in juxtaposing them.) As Anne M. Wagner has argued, the differentiated, or ambiguous, contents of Frankenthaler's paintings can be understood as gendered. Wagner maintains that the "femininity" of Frankenthaler's painting is exactly its "thick and conflicted description." In other words, it is "feminine" in its maintenance of oppositions, its contradictions, and in how it links difference to the identity of the painter. The canvases juxtapose the separate incidents of Frankenthaler's "pleasures and frustrations" and the sedimentary layers of her "procedures and history." Moreover, the feminine ambiguity of Frankenthaler's painting exposes the feminine ambiguity УТУ WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="10">that usually goes unnoticed in Jackson Pollock's: aspects of his painting are also "descriptive, layered, unsynthesized, 'too personal,' contradictory, aiming at boundlessness, relentlessly tactile."

Barbara Rose, for example, has written of "the big red hand of God at the top right..." (Barbara Rose, Helen Frankenthaler [New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1972], 88). Arthur Danto, explaining Frankenthaler's tendency to "accept" pictomorphs (quasi-representation) in her ostensibly abstract paintings, has written that for those who insist on reading this biblically-named work representationally, the "red raised hand... has to be the hand of God saying STOP!" (Arthur C. Danto, "Helen Frankenthaler," in Embodied Meanings : Critical Essays &amp; Aesthetic Meditations [New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1994], 28; originally published in The Nation , 21/28 August 1989.) 30.

Brach sees something fresh and daring in the work of this young artist. Frankenthaler "explores vital areas of abstract expressionism. Her frequent borrowing- from De Kooning, Gorky and Pollock - is never that of discipleship. The motifs she takes serve as points of departure for her own explorations" (18).

It is worth nothing that the sentence structure of Sawin's review seems to imitate the liquidity and flow of Frankenthaler's paintings. The notice is written using only lengthy sentences, and the prose evokes stream-of-consciousness writing, itself a metaphor for the operations of the subjective subconscious. 38. Of the nineteen paintings included in the Jewish Museum retrospective, only the earliest, Ed Winston's Tropical Gardens (1951-52), was not a soak-stain painting, but rather mixed media on paper mounted on board. 39.
