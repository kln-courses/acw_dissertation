<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anti-anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pen- tateuch. By CHARLES T. FRITSCH. ("Prince- ton Oriental Texts," No. 10.) Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1943. Pp. 81. $2.00. It is freely recognized that the Alexandrian Jews who rendered their Torah into Greek shared the restrained mood later manifested so notably in Philo's reinterpretation of the pentateuchal anthropomorphisms. Fritsch's study of this feature of the ancient translation is of value in the detail of its examination of the phenomena. These he organizes in eight chapters; then with a brief statement of "Con- clusions," two appendixes, a good bibliography, and a scriptural index the work concludes. This formal organization merits our thanks. But the net result is less impressive than the bulk of the treatment and the number of its subdivisions might imply. Certainly, there was no conscious, dominating purpose of the translators to remove anthropomorphic ex- pressions. Fritsch makes clear that in some cases the peculiarities he notes were not car- ried through consistently. But, further, the whole matter is conditioned by a complete absence of any objective criterion by which to identify an "anti-anthropomorphism." That the translators deviated from a precise word-by-word rendering of their original is susceptible of many explanations other than theological presupposition. Of this fact the author is not oblivious; but if he had taken sufficient account of it, his tabulation would have shrunk notably. Thus, the Hebrew panim ("faces") in three passages means "presence"; so "my presence shall go" is rendered into Greek as "I myself shall go before" (p. 11). But surely this is not "anti-anthropomorphic" at all, but just good, free translation. Similar are the cases in which Fritsch alleges "inter- mediary elements." "The salvation of the Lord" becomes "The salvation from God" (p. 54)-evidently the Jews of Alexandria knew the force of the Hebrew construct rela- tion, for again they have but given the sense of the Hebrew. In many cases the peculiarity noted is evidently occasioned by an effort to present the thought implicit in the compact</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 59 Hebrew expression. "Thou shalt be to him for (or as) God" becomes "thou shalt be to him those things relating to God" (p. 55). Why invoke here the advance of Alexandrian the- ology? This is nothing but what the Hebrew writer meant. A strange feature of Fritsch's discussion is that, except for very infrequent reference in some note, he ignores that feature most com- mon in discussions of the Septuagint, viz., the problem of text. One would suppose that the ancient translators had used our Revised Version and that their results had come down the centuries in impeccable transmission. "For this cause I caused thee to stand" appears in LXX as "On this account you were watched closely" (p. 49); but brief examination sug- gests intra-Greek corruption. The "tent of meeting" becomes the "tent of witness" (p. 31); but, when account is taken of the notable absence of "vowel letters" from the Vorlage of LXX, this Greek rendering is quite as legitimate as the English. Some corruption is certainly present in Exod. 17:16. The Greek should be used here as textual evidence, not as a revelation of theological bias (p. 26). Practically all the illustrations cited under "Grammatical Changes" (chap. vi) melt away on examination, partly because of the general looseness of treatment of the voice of the Hebrew verb (which Fritsch notes) but also in considerable degree because the alleged differences inhere in the English, not in the original. Thus (pp. 49 f.), Exod. 32:29 does not say, "that he may bestow upon you today a blessing" but, literally, "for putting upon you today a blessing"; the Greek says, "that a blessing may be given you." In Deut. 2:30 the Hebrew phrase says, literally, "for the sake of his giving into thy hand," which the Greek renders, "that he might be delivered into thy hands." These are typical of a con- siderable number of alleged peculiarities, which then are claimed to evidence an "anti- anthropomorphic" activity. But in reality they are nothing but just plain, good transla- tion. We have to do here, not with a change from active to passive, whatever that might signify for Fritsch's purpose, but with the phenomena of subjective and objective geni- tive. WILLIAM A.
