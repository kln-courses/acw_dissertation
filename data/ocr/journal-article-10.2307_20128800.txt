<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DOCTRINE OF SUBSTANCE AND WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI J.N debates concerning the relationship between basic principles of Whiteheadian process philosophy and the classical doctrine of substance, one can distinguish at least three types of essentially different approaches to the discussed issue: (1) Process metaphysics implies definitive rejection of substantialist categories of traditional philosophy, and introduces a radically new perspective in which no tions of flux and change replace the former categories of enduring substances and relative immutability of individual subjects. (2) Whitehead's approach to the traditional doctrine of substance re sults in a strong critique of it but not in total rejection. Certain elements of the Aristotelian and Cartesian legacy must be critically revised, but they cannot be eliminated from a rational interpretation of nature. Their implicit presence in Whiteheadian interpretative schemes substantiates the opinion that process metaphysics intro duces a reformed version of the doctrine of substance. (3) In spite of explicit critique of the concept of substance found in Whitehead's texts, the same texts implicitly presuppose the necessity of reference to certain substantialist categories. Whitehead himself did not al ways formally recognize such a necessity; his metaphysical asser tions, however, provide an objective basis for developing a modified theory of substance. Supporters of these essentially different viewpoints try to vin dicate their approaches by providing references to various works of Whitehead. It seems, however, impossible to defend thesis (1) unless general statements of "substantialist categories" are replaced by a more detailed formula concerning Aristotle's theory of primary substance. Whitehead did not deny substance in general but only the static substance of a material substratum; this denial resulted not from his critique of Aristotle but rather from a conviction that the notion of static stuff, so important for philosophical materialism, Review of Metaphysics 42 (June 1989): 765-781.

ZYCINSKI must be replaced by the notion of fluent and structured energy.1 Theses (2) and (3) may turn out to be mutually consistent if different texts of Whitehead are taken into consideration to justify them. The basic issue that I would like to discuss in this paper deals not with hermeneutic questions concerning consistent interpretation of various Whiteheadian texts, but with the substantive content of process metaphysics approached in the context of new scientific ev idence. In such an approach, Whitehead's particular pronounce ments on substance are not regarded as final conclusions but only as constitutive elements of an intellectually appealing philosophical vision that needs further detailed elaborations. Such a perspective, on the one hand, guards against interpretative dogmatism; on the other hand, it implies epistemological principles adopted by Whitehead himself in his using scientific theories and mathematical techniques to determine ontological structure of the examined reality.2 I The traditional opinion of antisubstantialist character of pro cess metaphysics was based on the fact that the concept of an en during substance sustaining persistent qualities is called "sheer er ror" in Process and Reality while the subject-predicate form of statement, essential for the Aristotelian-Scholastic tradition, is re garded as a result of prescientific, naive analysis. Whiteheadian objections against Aristotle's theory of primary substance are di rected against the concept of a static and vacuous substratum. The "static fallacy" relies on recognition of the unchanging subject of change. Whitehead categorically rejects this approach in his vision 1 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: Macmillan, 1957), 362. 2 In the paper "Mathematics and the Good," published in The Philos ophy of Alfred North Whitehead, ed. P. A. Schilpp (New York: Tudor, 1951), Whitehead argued: "mathematics is the most powerful technique for the understanding of pattern, and for the analysis of the relationships of pat terns" (p. 678). The metaphysical significance of physical theories he em phasized in Science and the Modern World (New York: Mentor Books, 1925), declaring that his "organic theory represents directly what physics actually does assume respecting its ultimate entities" (p. 140).</page><page sequence="3">SUBSTANCE AND WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 767 of the dynamic and creative universe in which no unchangeable sub jects exist. He does not question, however, the existence of stability and order in the flux of perishing events. Their presence provides a nontrivial ontological question: why is there order and harmony in the universe instead of free play of uncoordinated chaos? When answering this question one may find useful certain metaphysical categories worked out by Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz in their theories of substance. Whitehead often refrains from formally referring to these theories because of the ambiguous character of substantialist terminology as well as because of their connection with the static fallacy.3 Nonetheless, when introducing his new terminology, he openly admits adopting certain elements of the traditional doctrine of substance. He notices, for instance, that his notion of "defining characteristic" "is allied" to the Aris totelian notion of "substantial form,"4 and acknowledges that his organic philosophy "is close" to Spinoza's theory of substance and remains definitely closer to Descartes than to Newton.5 Similar comments suggest that the line of criticism in which an easy op position is introduced between Whitehead's process metaphysics and the traditional doctrine of substance is unfounded. If the latter is not illegitimately reduced to the Aristotelian theory of primary substance, one must recognize its implicit presence in the tenets of process metaphysics. William Christian's opinion that Whitehead "is really engaged in constructing an alternative doctrine of substance"6 was called into question by certain critics as a biased and inadequate inter pretation of process philosophy. From the standpoint of meta physics, one should be, nonetheless, much more interested in the adequacy of Whitehead's philosophy to explain the ontological structure of reality than in subtleties of adequate exposition of his 3 Cf. Process and Reality, 92: "For Descartes the word 'substance' is the equivalent of my phrase 'actual occasion.' I refrain from the term 'substance/ for one reason because it suggests the subject-predicate notion; and for another reason because Descartes and Locke permit their sub stances to undergo adventures of changing qualifications, and thereby cre ate difficulties." 4 Ibid., 40. 5 Ibid., 98. 6 William A. Christian, An Interpretation of Whitehead's Metaphysics, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959), 111.</page><page sequence="4">768 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI original thought. Calling into question the former adequacy, Andrew Reck argues that to explain rationally the nature of atomic events one has to recognize "the existence of substantial entities which endure through change." The lack of such a recognition in process philosophy results in undermining the very foundations of this philosophy.7 The adequacy of Whiteheadian ontology to interpret the spe cifically human experience of personal unity remains at least de batable, and new commentators still repeat the question posed in the Adventures of Ideas: what metaphysical categories must be adopted "to provide an adequate account of this undoubted personal unity, maintaining itself amidst the welter of circumstance"?8 The Aristotelian conception of primary substance, despite the defects resulting from its lack of compatibility with the quantum-mechan ical vision of nature, was consistent with our commonsense intu itions, and well explained our subjective feeling of self-identity. The Whiteheadian notion of the society of actual occasions corresponds well with the description of nature found in quantum cosmology; nevertheless, it not only remains distant to the domain of our macroexperience but also gives way to doubts whether or not the very notion of self-identity may be preserved in process philosophy.9 The basic question thus remains how to explain the experience of self-identity and relative permanence in the flux of changes after discarding the Aristotelian concept of primary substance as passive substratum. The authors who try to defend Aristotle, when answering this question, seem to practice a dubious apologetic since the notion of primary substance can scarcely be applied to microprocesses ex amined at the quantum level of nature. The notions of an "indi vidual thing's unity" and an "ultimate subject" that are used to 7 Andrew J. Reck, "Substance, Process, and Nature."

They be come, however, semantically meaningless when we try to apply them on the macrocosmic level. The world of biological organisms and human, personal experience can be well described in its structures when we employ philosophical categories that were worked out in the time of Aristotle. The situation becomes, nevertheless, much more complicated when we attempt to apply the notion of primary substance to the microworld. In quantum physics, it is operationally improper to formulate conclusions concerning individual electrons or single photons. The philosopher who would like to undertake such a procedure would groundlessly regard as universal these ontological structures that occur at the limited level of macroexperience. Such an unlimited extrapolation seemed justified in the epoch of Aristotle. It cannot be, however, defended in the present stage of the growth of science. Consequently, the philosophical concept of an individual object con sisting of an unchangeable substratum and unstable accidentals seems an anthropomorphism when we try to determine its desig nates at the quantum level of physical fields, vacuum fluctuations, and resonances associated with excited states of particles the life time of which is of the order of 10~16 seconds. Certainly, a firm Aristotelian could treat the ephemeral mesons and electromagnetic field as a one, a self-identical and relatively immutable "thing." Such an approach, however, neither expresses the philosophical tenets of Aristotelianism nor results in useful ex planations. It remains merely a manifestation of ontological com mitment in which adhering to determined philosophical tradition seems more important than the explanatory value of the examined conceptual tools. The defense of Aristotle in which one argues that the concept of primary substance results from a necessitarian analysis of on tological structures of being, and as such must be universal,10 does not take into consideration the fact that this concept cannot be meaningfully applied to the structures discovered at the level of microcosm. Whitehead's critique of primary substance resulted not 10 Cf. M. Krapiec, Metafizyka: Zarys Podstawowych Zagadnien, (Ksieg. sw. Wojciecha: Poznan, 1966), 321.</page><page sequence="6">770 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI from his psychological aversion to Aristotle but from his substan tiated conviction that the concept of a passive, unchangeable sub stratum expresses mainly linguistic preferences of the medieval logicians and can be no longer defended in physics after the Einstein Planck revolution. After accepting this critique, one may still con sider open the question whether or not a modified version of the doctrine of primary substance can be applied to these beings that exist in the domain examined by Aristotle when he proposed his theory of substance. As a positive answer to this question, one can develop "a re formed doctrine of substance"11 in which the concept of primary substance, free of unsubstantiated anthropomorphisms, may be in a cognitively valuable manner applied to organism and persons ex amined at the level of macroexperience, but cannot be considered a universal metaphysical category. Whitehead himself seemed to ac cept such a possibility when, at the end of chapter 2 in part 4 of Process and Reality, he acknowledged that "some features of the physical world" can be still explained by refering to the concept of primary substance.12 This concept cannot, however, be regarded as an ultimate metaphysical category that may be universally applied to interpret all types of natural phenomena. The problem remains thus: what type of universal metaphysical categories would play the role that was played by the notion of substance in traditional phi losophy? II The denial of the theory of primary substance by Whitehead resulted from his conviction that the theory in question relied on simplifying a commonsense vision of nature that can be no longer defended in the context of new scientific discoveries.13 The com monsense opposition between passive substratum and its qualities turned out to be poetic rather than scientific, when a new image of nature appeared in Newtonian dynamics. Nature was presented as 11 Christian, Whitehead's Metaphysics, 118. 12 Process and Reality, 363. 13 Science and Modern World, 53.</page><page sequence="7">SUBSTANCE AND WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 771 a "dull affair, soundless, scentless, colourless."14 When character istic qualities, described in predicative terms, turned out to depend rather on human senses than on a substantial substratum, John Locke argued for quantitative mass and spatial location as essential qualities of physical bodies. The growth of physics disclosed, how ever, defects in Locke's reinterpretation of substance when, in Ein stein's relativity theory, the Newtonian concept of space was dis missed and mass appeared as a "quantity of energy considered in relation to some of its dynamical effects."15 After mass and matter lost the "unique preeminence" of being the final, permanent constituent of the physical world, Wilhelm Ost wald?in his Ueberwindung des naturwissenschaftlichen Mate rialismus?proposed the concept of energy as the basic philosophical category. Though Whitehead shared Ostwald's view that modern physics definitely overcame the materialism of the Enlightenment, he did not agree that energy could play the role in the new philosophy of nature played formerly by substance. For him, "energy" was "merely the name for the quantitative aspect of a structure of hap penings."16 A new ontology cannot be constructed simply by intro ducing novel scientific terms to the dictionary of metaphysics. The philosophy in which one critically employs breakthrough scientific discoveries must adopt new explanatory patterns and the radically new vision of nature provided by these discoveries. If the notion of a material substratum lost its position in science, a new system of metaphysics must be developed in which the central role would be played by formal structures that coordinate the flux of events. In spite of ostensible analogies, process metaphysics remains remote from Heraclitus' variabilism. In its framework, the phrase "all things flow" does not justify ontological relativism, but yields the most intriguing metaphysical questions dealing with the onto logical structure of the flow in question.17 The Heraclitean phrase "all things flow" when expressed in the language of the new math ematical physics adopts the form: "All things are vectors."18 Con sequently, the flux of perishing events can be compared neither to 14 Science and Modem World, 55. 15 Ibid., 96. 16 Ibid., 96. 17 Process and Reality, 241. 18 Ibid., 362.</page><page sequence="8">772 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI illusory maya nor to the random play of chaos. The flux has a rich mathematical structure and its rational elucidation "is one chief task of metaphysics."19 When Leibniz attempted to modify the doctrine of substance in the light of seventeenth-century physics, he refered to the concepts of force, power, and dynamic potentiality to express in more adequate form the traditional opinions.20 Whitehead implicitly acknowledges the essential elements of this doctrine in his exposition of the con cepts of actual occasion, eternal objects, and the primordial nature of God. In The Interpretation of Science, he openly admits that his notion of perishing occasions replaces the Cartesian concept of the enduring substance.21 The perishing occasions, most often called actual entities, are the final existents of minimal spatiotemporal extension. Complex compounds given in our macroexperience are derivative entities in the sense that they consist of "societies" or bundles of actual entities successively superseding one other. These societies are constituted by well-determined ordered relationships between the constituting actual entities. Though we cannot discover a passive substratum in this cog nitive framework, we can notice that the society of actual entities has a richer formal structure than that of a simple aggregate. Par ticular groups of actual entities not only remain in a genetic inter relatedness by virtue of their prehensive interactions, but also they exhibit in their prehensive actings specific forms common to all ele ments of a given group. This common form, called by Whitehead the "defining characteristic" of societies of actual entities, discloses obvious analogy with the Aristotelian concept of the substan tial form.22 Despite the discarding of the notion of primary substance, rel ative stability and permanence manifest their presence in the flow of actual entities because the same formal structure is exempli fied in all elements of the flux of events. The difference between 19 Process and Reality, 241. 20 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Philosophical Papers and Letters, ed. and trans. L. E. Loemker, (Dordrecht-Holland, 1969), 433. 21 See Whitehead, The Interpretation of Science (Indianapolis: Bobbs Merill, 1961): "In the place of Descartes's substance with 'endurance' as one of its principal attributes, we must put the notion of an 'occasion' with 'supersession' as part of its real essence" (p. 240). 22 Process and Reality, 40.</page><page sequence="9">SUBSTANCE AND WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 773 Aristotle and Whitehead is that the former conceived the substantial form as a characteristic of one single substance; the latter conceives "the defining characteristic" as the form common to a "society" of substances, that is, of actual entities. Consequently, as Ivor Leclerc writes, "it can be said that Whitehead does have what Leibniz is unable to have, namely a plurality which is something more than a mere aggregate."23 Owing to the fact that the same formal structure is exemplified in a plurality of individual substances one may notice its similarity to the Aristotelian secondary substance, understood as an essence or a form. According to Metaphysics 7, secondary substance is pri mary and kath' auto. Its appearance in Aristotle's thought might have been inspired by Plato's theory of forms because the Stagirite regarded the forms as secondary substances dependent on concrete individuals. This opposition was not consistently developed, since in Metaphysics 7.7.1032bl an abstract essence (eidos) is described not only as a substance (ousia) but also as a primary substance. Leaving aside hermeneutic issues that deal both with the objective evolution of Aristotle's thought and his subjective preferences de pendent on time, we must acknowledge that in Scholastic exposition of the doctrine of substance, the so called deutera ousia, that is, the constituent of generic properties of being's nature, played a very important role. In lectio 10 of his comments on Aristotle's Meta physics, Aquinas discerns four types of substance and subsequently reduces them to two: the ultimate subject and its species or form.24 It seems that in Whitehead's process metaphysics the theory of secondary substance receives a more detailed elaboration than in the fluctuating opinions of Aristotle. The creative order of nature remains in process philosophy neither an accident nor a plain fact that must be taken for granted. The universe's dynamic order ul timately depends on a "basic adjustment of the togetherness of eter nal objects" that is called the primordial nature of God.25 God, in his eternal envisagement, structures the realm of ideal possibilities denoted by the term 'eternal objects' in regard to their relational 23 Ivor Leclerc, The Nature of Physical Existence, (New York: Hu manities Press, 1972), 290.

ZYCINSKI essences. The role of these eternal objects, Whitehead himself compared to the role of the Platonic forms.26 Their ontological sig nificance is expressed in the fact that eternal objects as such, though real, are merely potentials for actual entities. When considered independent of their ingression in God's primordial nature, they would be indistinguishable from nonbeing. Their exemplifications formed in the flux of perishing actual entities create a specific "one ness of the universe" in which each creature contributes to the cre ative advance, contains the whole of history, and exemplifies both the self-identity of things and their diversity. Although Whitehead himself names his philosophy "through and through Cartesian" and admits that Locke's notion of "sub stance" is in it "transformed into that of 'actual entity',"27 it is easy to indicate many analogies between Spinoza's concept of substance as causa sui and the conception of actual entities that share with God the characteristic of self-causation.28 The unity of all actual occasions and the dynamic order discovered in the flux of events disclose the metaphysically important structure of the universe. The ultimate reality revealing its presence in the dynamic ongoing ness of changes can be compared only to "Spinoza's one infinite sub stance."29 The synthesis of actual activity underlying all occasions and of possibilities of ideal order constituted by ideal objects is characteristic of the essence of "the one substance"30 which, as in Spinoza, "in se est et per se concipitur.ffS1 The role played by it in the flux of events is such that the occurrence of particular events is neither accidental nor subject to explanations by anything external.32 This unity of order in flux may be understood by considering the hierarchy of mutual relationships that are prior to concrete events since they are constituted by relational essences of eternal objects determining "(potential) interconnections with all other 26 Process and Reality, 58. 27 Ibid., 23. 28 Ibid., 260. 29 Science and Modern World, 159. 30 Ibid. 31 Baruch Spinoza, Ethics 1, def. 3: "Per substantiam intelligo id quod in se est et per se concipitur; hoc est, id, cujus conceptus non indiget conceptu alterius rei, a quo formari debeat."

Shakespeare's sonnets and Bach's fugues, formal relations expressed in the multiplication table, and the moral beauty of the Sermon on the Mount all contain the same element of ordered structure that on various levels ingresses into reality of flowing events and discloses the internal constitution of being. Its study was so important for the rational tradition of the West that it would be impossible to understand our civilization while ignoring the role of this structure.36 To determine the ultimate factor constituting metaphysical, axiological, and moral order, one has, again as did Spinoza, to refer to God. Our sense of deity makes possible the discovery of the unity between a transcendent order and the multiplicity of realized ac tualities; God remains "that factor in the universe whereby there is importance, value, and ideal beyond the actual."37 The essence of the actual cannot be understood by the plain examination of ob servable reality because no finite realization of an eternal object "can exhibit the full potentialities of its nature."38 Contrary to empiricist critiques of the doctrine of substance, to understand the observable reality of the actual one must refer to the invisible order constituted by the so-called conceptual feelings of potentialities in the primordial nature of God. This nature introduces order into the flux of changes in the evolving universe because it constitutes preconditions of history39 and standards of values, "the ground of rationality," and "the ground for concrete actuality."40 33 "Whitehead to Hartshorne, 2 January 1936," in Alfred North White head: Essays on His Philosophy, ed.

ZYCINSKI The perishing temporal events "arise by their participation in the things which are eternal."41 The observed flow of departing forms is ontologically rooted in the transcendent order of ideal forms. The latter plays in process metaphysics the same role as Aristotle's substance played in his Metaphysics. Ill When Descartes examined the scholastic doctrine of substance, he opposed the elements of the doctrine that are important for ra tional interpretations to those that seem to imply internal incon sistencies.42 Whitehead continued the same practice when, ex pressing his sympathy to Descartes' res verae43 and Spinoza's one substance, he critically assessed many contentions of both authors. The same attitude is adopted by his contemporary critics who ac centuate both ambiguities of Whitehead's terminology and contro versial discordances in the subsequent expositions of his thought. When the dubious status of eternal objects is discussed or when the fuzzy notion of "envisagement" inspires new polemics, one cannot expect unanimity in the reconstruction of Whiteheadian views on the enduring legacy of traditional versions of substantialism. One should notice, however, that Whitehead's revision of the traditional doctrine, the revision inspired by the growth of scientific theories, can be harmoniously adjusted to new important discoveries in the domain of relativistic physics. As an example, one may examine new theories of quantum field theory. This discipline, containing the theoretically most advanced branch of contemporary science, provides new theoretical models that would create interpretative problems for the supporters of the theory of primary substance, but which at the same time can be easily interpreted from the standpoint of Whiteheadian metaphysics. 41 Process and Reality, 53. 42 In Ren? Descartes, "R?ponses aux quatri?mes objections" 1, ?13, in Les M?ditations M?taphysiques (Paris: P.U.F., 1956), he indicated that the concept of incomplete substance implies the contradictions contained in the suggestion that there are "des choses qui subsistent par soi, et. . . qui ne peuvent pas subsister par soi" (p. 201). 43 Adventures of Ideas, 190.</page><page sequence="13">SUBSTANCE AND WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 777 The content of the commonsense component of the Aristotelian doctrine of primary substance may be easily explained when we take into consideration certain regularities of the intellectual evo lution of the human species that result from the nature of our phy logenetic development. The picture of the world formed on our retina depends on the human eye reacting only to light wavelengths between 4,000-8,000 angstroms. With such biological conditioning, at the threshold of our intellectual growth, the reality of individual material objects, of flowers and stones, animals and trees appears to be cognitively important. This epistemology of commonsense empiricism was overcome by Greek philosophers who tried to de termine invisible archai of being. Their philosophical reflection remained, nevertheless, dominated by the pressure of individual ob jects. The Aristotelian theory of primary substance resulted from this intellectual fascination with the concrete. The concrete com pound appeared as basic ontological structure in the domain of ex periences familiar to Aristotle's contemporaries. Subsequent ex pansion of this domain yielded both the questioning of the Aristo telian theory of substance and the discarding of commonsense epistemology. In the eighteenth century, the traditional philosophy of sub stance was questioned from the standpoint of empiricism and ma terialism which, in the initial stage of modern science, seemed to provide a justified Weltanschauung explaining new scientific results. In its explanatory framework, the traditional concept of substance was supposed to be useless since the ultimate questions of philosophy were supposed to be completely explained by reference to the ob servable reality. As a matter of fact, the evolution in modern science indicates that empiricism provided methodology useful only in the initial stages of scientific growth. In the most developed scientific disciplines, new discoveries consistently require transcending the empirical world to discover the hidden reality of abstract structures. Because of this evolution, opinions have been formulated that matter itself has dematerialized in contemporary science and properties ascribed traditionally to the so-called material objects can no longer be ascribed to the physical structures examined in theoretical physics. To see whether or not similar opinions are justified, let us consider the status of the so called vacuum fluctuations that are described in the quantum field theory.</page><page sequence="14">778 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI A vacuum in quantum electrodynamics is conceived as the state of the lowest energy field in which no physical particles exist. The absence of the particles may be described by the simple mathemat ical formula 8l\[/0 = 0, where a is the operator of annihilation and \[/ the state vector. In spite of the absence of physical particles, fields do not disappear in the vacuum; they exist and can be described in the language of mathematics. The state vector corresponding to an arbitrary arrangement of n particles in states i = 1, 2,... can be mathematically described as the result of the action of n operators of particles creation on the state vector of a vacuum. Letting a? designate the operator of the creation of particles in a state i, we obtain the dependence \p = a*!a*2, ..., a*n^0. Consistently, the mean value of every physical quantity can be presented in the form of the mean value of the operator in the state of the physical vacuum. For this reason, the vacuum is regarded as a set of potentialities which can be realized in the world of our physical experience.44 Neither commonsense categories of everyday experience nor our imagination can be used to conceive this state of a physical vacuum. The vacuum can be, however, adequately described in a simple and elegant formula of mathematics. Such a description provided, for instance, by the already classical theory of Englert, Brout and Gunzig explains how the universe would have emerged from the vacuum as a result of the initial symmetry breaking. In this theory, as well as in corresponding solutions proposed by Stephen Hawking, James Hartle, or Alex Vilenkin,45 mathematically described sym metries are the only cosmic structures in the earliest state of the universe when no physical particles exist. The powerful language of mathematics can be applied to the exotic states of nature where both our commonsense and our intuitive categories fail. In this state no physical particles exist. Consequently, the traditional no tion of matter as a substratum cannot be used in its classical sense. The concept of individual object cannot be used for different reasons, 44 A popular exposition of these theories may be found in H. Pagels, The Cosmic Code (New York: Bantam Books, 1983) as well as in his Perfect Symmetry (New York: Bantam Books, 1986). 45 References to the original works and their popular exposition may be found, for instance, in John Gribbin, In Search of the Big Bang (New York: Bantam Books, 1986). Unacceptable remains only the concluding comment in which Gribbin suggests that due to new physical discoveries "it is the metaphysicians who are out of a job" (p. 392).</page><page sequence="15">SUBSTANCE AND WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 779 because fluctuations are approached statistically and there is no operational sense to refer to an individual fluctuation. The formal structure of the quantum vacuum thus creates an interpretative riddle for adherents of metaphysical materialism and commonsense epistemology, but it may be easily interpreted from the standpoint of Whiteheadian process philosophy. Ephemeral fluctuations enduring infinitesimally short intervals correspond with the actual entities. Formal structures of the vacuum and poten tialities of growth determined by them can be explained by reference to eternal objects as potentials for creative advance. Their ingres sion in the flux of quantum events is well illustrated by physical processes that took place twenty billion years ago near the so-called initial singularity. Certainly, there are also other systems of meta physics that may be consistent with new physical theories concerning the early stages of the cosmic evolution. It remains, however, im portant that the metaphysical categories proposed in Process and Reality remain both natural and adequate when we extrapolate them into a new cognitive domain to interpret philosophically the exotic reality of quantum processes in the electrodynamic vacuum. IV The exact reconstruction of Whitehead's attitude to the tradi tional doctrine of substance remains difficult because of substantial evolution in his views and because in choosing linguistic forms he "was a far from careful writer."46 In spite of persisting interpre tative dilemmas, an analysis of the basic principles of Whiteheadian metaphysics renders groundless the popular opinions that process philosophy categorically discards any form of substantialism. When introducing indispensable distinctions in this simplified image, it seems particularly important to note the following seven points. (1) Considering Whitehead together with Heidegger as authors "united in their suspicion or open condemnation of substance"47 overlooks their differing attitudes towards traditional metaphysics. 46 J. L. Nobo, Whitehead's Metaphysics of Extension and Solidarity (Al bany: State University of New York Press, 1986), 1. 47 W. Barett, Death of the Soul (Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1987), 128.</page><page sequence="16">780 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI While Heidegger, in his critique of classical metaphysics, called into question basic assumptions of ontology, Whitehead regarded meta physical reflection as an important constitutive element of human civilization. (2) Whitehead's views on this topic should not be connected with the empiricist critique of substance because he explicitly ac knowledges that metaphysical reflections upon substance and the Absolute were important for the growth of our civilization as they implied overcoming naive empiricism.48 (3) Definitive rejection of the Aristotelian concept of primary substance results from the fact that this notion, useful in inter preting biological phenomena known to Aristotle, remains a useless anthropomorphism in the domain of physical processes, especially at the level of the microworld. This concept cannot be treated as universal and ultimate in metaphysics, but it still may be used to interpret "some features of the physical world."49 This acknowl edgment leaves open the question of whether the concept can be still used in philosophical anthropology where the terminological basis provided by process metaphysics remains evidently inadequate. (4) Heraclitean elements contained in process philosophy do not imply denial of substance because the flux of events, as inter preted by Whitehead, is not an accidental chaos but an ordered ex emplification of relations constituted by eternal objects. White headian principles explaining this order contain many things in common with the Aristotelian theory of secondary substance, Descartes' res verae, and Spinoza's causa sui. (5) Whitehead's reluctance to use the term 'substance' might have been inspired, at least in part, by an attempt to avoid termi nological ambiguities connected with the term. That debates even on variants of Aristotle's theory of substance still generate new controversies should prompt one to introduce terminology indepen dent of controversial issues of the past. Terminological preferences expressed in replacing Cartesian "substance" by "actual entity" re main relatively unimportant when the role of formal structure and unactualized potential is taken into consideration in the new inter pretative patterns. 48 Modes of Thought, 71. 49 Process and Reality, 363.</page><page sequence="17">SUBSTANCE AND WHITEHEAD'S METAPHYSICS 781 (6) New physical theories in which the physical substratum plays no role confirm the Whiteheadian thesis that matter disap peared from the scientific image of nature and that essential physical structures can be described in the terms of mathematical relations. This epistemological revolution originated by Einstein and Planck still goes on in physics providing theories that seem hardly consistent with the philosophy of materialism and empiricism. Metaphysical ramifications of these theories can be easily interpreted in terms of process metaphysics. (7) It is hard to demonstrate conclusively that Whitehead ac cepted "the necessity of a reformed doctrine of substance."50 It is much easier to discover that central principles of his philosophy remain close to metaphysical tenets underlying the doctrine of sub stance. Critical reflection upon both the principles and the doctrine may turn out to be heuristically valuable and can really reverse "the slow descent of accepted thought towards the inactive common place."51 Pontifical Academy of Cracow 50 Christian, Whitehead's Metaphysics, 118, 111. 51 Modes of Thought, 174.</page></plain_text>
