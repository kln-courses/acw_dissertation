<plain_text><page sequence="1">surely insist that, however exciting the prospects revealed by parallels between the German tradition and Latin or French literature, between Veldeke's role and that of Chretien, these non-German parallels are strictly secondary and only acquire significance if Maurer is able to prove his point from within the German evidence itself. It is in this restricted field that Maurer's argument must first carry conviction and it is precisely here that we lack the evidence at the moment which will allow us to reject or accept his findings. One of Maurer's major criteria for establishing the presence of stanzas (especially in the longer poems) is the existence of what he claims to be self-contained units or blocks (independent in form or content). Yet the only evidence we are given (and can be given within the scope of a general introduction or brief notes to each poem) is a reference to the findings of several unpublished Seminararbeiten. These may well be conscientiously done and their results quite acceptable, but we have no means of telling and therefore no oppor- tunity of judging Maurer's argument. Secondly, Maurer recognizes that the problem of 'Reimbrechung' is a crucial one and sees the development of this technique as preparing the way for the emergence of the new narrative flow which he associates with the rhymed couplets of courtly literature. In order to judge Veldeke's position (is he the absolute innovator which Maurer would make of him?) we should need to know much more about the technique of 'Reimbrechung' than was given by de Boor in his 'Friihmittelhochdeutsche Studien'. Maurer himself concedes (p. 47) that the narrative of the Exodus (by comparison with the Wiener Genesis) is no longer entirely confined to 'Langzeilen'. Does not this early evidence suggest the possibility that 'Reimbrechung', the technique of ensuring narrative flow, might be connected with the emergence of the biblical epics, of narrative works on a larger scale (here the 'Hakenstil' of the Heliand would be an earlier parallel)? This would have to be investigated, together with the whole problem of 'Reimbrechung' in the twelfth century, but until we have the evidence I do no see how we can accept (or reject) Maurer's suggestion. A last caveat is sug- gested by the mention of de Boor's 'Friihmittelhochdeutsche Studien', for this work clearly established the importance of the Strassburg version of the Alexander- lied in the development of'Reimbrechung'. This reminds us that Maurer's view of Veldeke's role is dictated by the belief that Veldeke preceded the Strassburger Alexander. For this he is able to refer to recent work by J. van Mierlo and Cola Minis, but it should not be thought that this necessarily settles the matter. Perhaps Professor Dittrich will shed light on this matter in the second volume of her Veldeke studies, but for the moment the uncertainty of Veldeke's priority, like our ignorance of the development of 'Reimbrechung' before Veldeke, must qualify our attitude to Maurer's argument. A book which questions received opinions and concludes with any number of open questions - this sounds very much like a review of the same author's 'Nord- germanen und Alemannen'. Both books agree in forcing us to look critically at traditional views and in giving problems enough for another generation. Could an author wish for a greater compliment? D. H. GREEN D. H.

This new study gives further evidence and documentation for the views put forward in earlier articles (1959 and 1963) by the same authors on the source of much of Wolfram's arcane knowledge and the identity of his informant. The largest part of the book is concerned with showing resemblances between Hermetic writings and Wolfram's statements about the Grail. This catalogue begins dis- appointingly enough with a number of features shared by Hermetic writings and Christian doctrine, so that they can hardly be used as evidence for use by Wolfram of exotic sources; thus the relationship of the Word to the Divine Wisdom (Nous) is more readily derived from the first chapter of St John's Gospel than anywhere else, and statements that God is not anthropomorphic, is mysterious, is immutable, is light, is truth, are too current in Christian writing to offer any clue to Wolfram's sources. Not all the alleged parallels are even particularly close; thus the non- anthropomorphic nature of God has to be inferred from the lines: 'er hat vil durch uns getan, / sit sin edel hoher art ! durch uns ze menschen bilde wart' (462, 22-4), where the appearance of God the Father is not at issue; and the authors them- selves admit that the parallel in Hermetic writings for Feirefiz's inability to see the Grail before he is baptized, is 'somewhat obscured by Christian trappings'. On the physical nature of the Grail the authors are ingenious, though they appear to be too ready to conflate all manner of contradictory views. They make a good case for the resemblance of the Grail to the Krater on the grounds inter alia that both were brought down in a similar way from Heaven, and that the two words Krater and Grail are etymologically identical. The Krater served on occasions as a baptismal font, and it is claimed that 'Wolfram's use of the term "stone" does not tell us anything about the shape, the material, or the use of the Grail; in short, nothing indicates that the Grail is not a vessel'. Yet stress is laid elsewhere on the association of the Grail with the myth of the Phoenix, and here, both Wolfram's text and one of the pictorial representations reproduced in the plates appear to require some kind of column or obelisk, in contrast with the chalice-like shapes associated with other usages of the term Krater. It is also rather over-ingenious to relate a metaphorical use of the term 'magnet' in treatises on the Hermetic Krater to Wolfram's use of the word stein, and then to adduce other sources for evidence of the unprepossessing appearance of the lodestone in support of an interpretation of the problematic lapsit exillis as lapis exilis 'paltry stone'. There seems to be a reasonable case for seeing in Trevrizent an embodiment of Hermes Trismegistus himself. Even the name Trevrizent may be derived from the Old French treble escient, related through Latin allusions to the triplex scientia and Arabic loan-translations of Trismegistus or 'Thrice-Greatest'. But the use of ety- mologies to establish identities is perhaps too elaborate to be completely convincing; individual deductions are acceptable enough, yet the sum of several such con- jectures does not amount to proof positive. Similarly, the firm identification of Kyot, who 'ze D6olt verworfen ligen vant / in heidenscher schrifte / dirre aventiur gestifte' (453, I2-I4) with Guillem (hypocoristic form Guillot) de Tudela, author of the first part of the Chanson de la croisade albigeoise, has already been disputed (by H. Kolb, Munsalvasche (Munich, 1963), pp. I95-7), on the grounds that Guillem is never referred to as Guillot, that if he were, the pronunciation of Guiot and Guillot were distinctive for his time and dialect, and that there is no reason for assuming that Dolet is Tudela rather than Toledo. As if in answer to the last objection, the present work points to numerous medieval French and German references to the renown of spears and helmets from Tudela, but the wider fame of Toledo and the similarity of the names calls, at the very least, for some comment.</page><page sequence="3">The authors' confident identification of Kyot is thus not completely free from objection. Much the same may be said of the reasoning by which the authors account for the transmission of Hermetic lore to Wolfram: the general line through Arabic intermediaries to Guillem is sound, and it is likely that he would have been geographically well placed to receive these traditions, but the recondite know- ledge admitted by him in his autobiographical prefaces is 'geomancy', which, indeed, has a bearing both on Hermetic doctrine and on some statements in Parzival (notably those on the influence of the stars), but it is not directly concerned with the Grail itself. This is not to deny the points of detail where the authors have established a close correspondence between Hermetic writings and Wolfram's statements about the Grail and its community. There is not always an obvious alternative source for his recondite knowledge. A case in point is the symbolic interpretation of the number and grouping of the maidens in the Grail procession, and the different number and grouping, also symbolic, of the lamps they carry. Here Wolfram's resemblance to a Hermetic source, rather exceptionally, amounts to identity, and is sufficiently detailed to rule out the likelihood of coincidence. On the score of this evidence alone, Wolfram's dependence on material other than undifferentiated hearsay appears to be assured, though the authors' lack of caution on other points leads one to question whether they have looked far enough for a possible alternative explana- tion. No evidence is offered that Guillem de Tudela dealt specifically with this point, which is the one above all others where Wolfram's recondite knowledge might most simply be attributed to the influence of Hermetic writings. It could be urged, for example, that, since some elements of Hermetic doctrine reached Chartres in the twelfth century (see pp. I30 ff.), these ideas might have spread through the Church from this intellectual centre; but there is no positive proof, here either, of a direct source for the most conspicuous resemblance between Wolfram and Hermetism. If such a source could be found, it would damage the credibility of identifications of Kyot. Given the nature of medieval narrative and the specific qualities of Wolfram von Eschenbach, it is unlikely that the name Kyot masks an eclectic use of several unidentifiable sources; it is likely either to cover Wolfram's own additions to his source or to be the name of a real informant. This study makes the latter alternative very probable, but its positive identification of Kyot as Guillem de Tudela is less convincing. Its etymologies and its general reasoning alike betray a certain naivete, and appear to back up a preconceived notion of the identity of Kyot with every scrap of evidence possible, with little regard for the weight of the evidence or for possible objections. It is, however, a very thorough study of some remote texts, and its method of presentation, making fewer assumptions than most comparable works of the omniscience of its readers, is a model of lucidity. It is good that the evidence of manuscript illustration and other pictorial representation is drawn on, though it is a pity that there is little or no cross-reference between text and plates; and the views of Tudela and the picture from Wieland Wagner's recent Bayreuth production of Parsifal are of doubtful relevance.
