<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMAN ORGANIZATION 11 Animal Studies and Human Behavior Bertram Schaffner , M.D.* Contemporary students of human behavior will do well to keep abreast of what contemporary students of animal be- havior are thinking and discovering. Working concepts that we have honored and used for the last century are being reexamined and tested ; some are in the process of redefinition, others found wanting or incorrect, while exciting new ones emerge. Simple closed energy systems are giving way to relativity patterns, consideration of individual differences, and the inclusion of relationships and timing as vital factors in the explanation of events in nature. In the middle of the 19th century, Darwin revitalized the study of man by show- ing that philosophers would have to leave their academic chambers and look at living creatures in the woods and fields. The result was a happy one for the development of anthro- pology, sociology, psychology, and the related social sciences, including psychiatry. Unfortunately, it would seem, the social scientists' enth ¿asm and success in their discoveries about human behavior led them far away from the original stimulus of animal studies. Perhaps there is an historical tendency in Western culture to divorce man from the animal, or possibly we specialists tend to forget all specialties but our own. In either case, the gap is a dangerous one. The recent conference on "Group Processes"1 affords the busy social scientist a broad view of the kinds of radical re- visions that are taking place, together with an opportunity to "hear" students of animal behavior critically discuss their own attempts to ferret out the secrets of living organisms. Their results are particularly dramatic, when one remembers that their work had to proceed without benefit of verbal com- munication with their experimental subjects. Consequently, they had to sharpen their observation during experiments and also their thinking about the nature of observation and inter- pretation, with conclusions well worth consideration by social scientists confronted with similar problems in observation and interpretation. One of the outstanding points made by the animal psy- chologists was this : the behavior of any living organism, from cell to body-part to whole animal, can be understood only when one has learned not only its present functioning, but * Dr. Schaffner is a psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. 1. This conference was held at Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., Sept 26-30, 1954, and sponsored by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foun- dation. The proceedings of the conferences, entitled "Group Processes: Transactions of the First Conference" have recent- ly been published in book form by the same Foundation. also its past history, the internal factors operating, the external factors at work, and the time in its development when specific internal or external factors began to affect it. In this kind of longitudinal approach to the study of a function, it can be seen that there are times when an individual organism is not yet ready to react, or is at maximal readiness to react, or is past reacting, or will change its type of reaction, although the stimulus remains the same throughout. What the organism has previously experienced or learned, or how the organism has been changed earlier, will materially affect its present and future behavior. Internal factors cannot be regarded as autonomous. They may play a role in determining the direc- tion and extent of the potential development ("prospective potency")2 of the individual organism, but external factors are essential to the achievement of that potential as well as crucial in how far such growth will proceed. Prospective potency usually far exceeds the developments which finally take place. The growth of the various parts of the fertilized egg, for example, is certainly dependent upon internal factors within the egg, such as the appropriate simul- taneous development of other parts of the embryo, but also certainly dependent upon factors external to the egg, such as heat, air and fluid requirements. Even the development of a simple nerve-cell can only be understood in terms of both intra- and extra-cellular factors. In another area, genes were formerly thought to have a constant unchanging one-to-one relationship to hereditary characteristics. Now we learn that genes have variable effects at different times in the life of the organism and in different quantity, and, also important, may even exert a changed hereditary effect when the gene's position is changed relative to the other genes. Genes influence be- havior and function sometimes in early life, but also in later life at particular periods. The type of reaction or damage caused by external factors likewise varies according to the timing and nature of the external factors. In terms of human beings, the parallel is easily seen: what is usually called a "traumatic incident" will have variable effects, depending upon the previous history of the person, the age at which the incident takes place, the relationships of the person at the time it takes place, the quality, quantity and duration of the traumatizing.3 2.

The old arguments about heredity and environment, while still interesting, must now be seen as essentially irrelevant. The innate hereditary patterns cannot express themselves apart from the necessary influences brought to bear upon them by the environment, and the elements in the hereditary picture which will be activated or inhibited or neglected, are de- pendent upon the forces in the environment at the time. The powers of neither heredity nor environment can be fully understood except in terms of each other. The so-called barrier between the organism and the environment is really a misnomer; in reality there is a constant merging, inter- penetration, and interaction between them, of the utmost significance. The relevance of this concept for the comprehension of individual human growth, development, and survival will be readily apparent, as well as the subsequent development of group behavior. For example, the newborn in most animal species could not survive except for a most complicated but regular series of interactions between the newborn and its mother. The newborn goat has a relatively high stage of neuromuscular development, potentially capable of breathing, standing and nursing. Whether it will succeed in developing these vital abilities, however, depends upon certain specific responses of the mother-goat. If she turns to her newborn kid, tastes the amniotic fluid covering the kid, the process vital to the kid's survival begins. She proceeds to lick up all the amniotic fluid ; the vigorous licking of the mother stimulates muscular tonus in the kid. Its nostrils are cleared, its respira- tory and leg muscles now function adequately, and it soon stands up. Without this happening, it would not be able to nurse. The mother's licking proceeds in a regular direction, beginning at the front end of the kid and proceeding toward the hind end, as a result of which the kid is oriented alongside the mother's body and its head gradually directed toward the mother's teats. Then nursing can take place. The mother has responded to the covering of amniotic fluid, and the kid has responded to the mother's licking and direction of position. The kid, one might say, had the innate potential ability to obtain nourishment, but would not have realized that potential except for the interaction with the mother. Similarly, the kid soon begins to bleat ; to each bleat from the kid, the mother responds with a bleat of her own, and vice versa. The im- portance of this apparently simple action-response pattern cannot be over-estimated. The mother-goat soon comes to respond in a special way to the bleat of her own kid, dis- criminating between the bleats of her own and other goats' kids. She violently rejects any other kid coming toward her, thus insuring her milk to her own kid and also, in effect, sending each kid back towards its own mother. The mutual bleating behavior apparently serves a double protective pur- pose. In times of danger, the continued bleating and answering pattern enables the kid to endure unpleasant or noxious situa- tions more effectively (one is tempted to use the word "calmly" because the physiological reactions to danger in the kid outwardly resemble human fear) ; the continued bleating of the kid also enables the mother to locate her kid, in case she has become separated from it. As long as the kid hears the mother's bleating, it tends to remain active ; when it no longer hears the mother's bleating, it stops bleating and tends to become still, remaining in one place. This again has a protective value: in case the herd of goats is attacked by an outside danger, the mother-goat is free to go to meet the danger, while the kid remains where it is and does not reveal its presence by bleating. When the mother-goat returns, it resumes bleating in response to hers.4 The extreme importance of the successful establishment of these inter-relationships is illustrated by the fact that, after any experimental interruption of these patterns, both mother and newborn appear to be unable to go forward to further development until the patterns have been re-enacted and re-established. Moreover, kids which have undergone too much interruption of these patterns seem to succumb more easily to illness and to have a shorter life-span. Similar phenomena have been described in human babies by René Spitz.5 Individual mother-goats and individual kids responded with noticeable differences; nevertheless, the basic need for the interaction between them remained the same. Neither mother nor kid could be understood except in terms of the process taking place between them. It appears that one of the universal factors affecting devel- opment is the impact of a considerable amount of stimulation and interaction from the environment, including social inter- change, and it may well be that this universal extrinsic factor is just as important for life as the various chemical factors in the intra-uterine environment. Even such complex func- tions as the development of habits of thought and adequate social responsiveness to other individuals seem to be dependent upon interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In terms of perception and learning, similar principles evolve. Whether the early environment of an organism is impoverished or enriched will profoundly affect learning ability. Animals with broader and more varied early oppor- tunities and environment generally have superior abilities in problem-solving. The subsequent effects of rich or poor opportunities also depend upon the time in the animal's life when it was exposed to such conditions. Laboratory-reared apes, for example, appear to be superior to those living in the wild who are not confronted with the varied challenges pre- sented to a caged ape.6 One of the differences between human beings and animals appears to be the fact that human beings structure the environment so as to offer greater opportunities for learning and performance than nature alone would offer, and that we make demands upon the individual that he learn more.

Sheep, generally stereotyped as "stupid" animals, have been shown to "learn" very differently when isolated from the flock and exposed to different condi- tions and different opportunities.7 Moreover, animals which have already gone through many learning experiences, approach new learning more systemat- ically and quickly, give up more easily efforts which prove inadequate; some animals after mastering a problem begin to make mistakes for reasons not yet understood but which seem to resemble boredom, playfulness, curiosity, or even expectation of change as an expectable part of an experiment.8 Animals with long experience in learning even seem to learn to avoid irrelevant clues! It can now be seen that a fuller comprehension of the interaction between individuals offers a biologically- and psychologically-oriented foundation for the understanding of group processes. The significance of the intrinsic factors within individuals, and their necessity for activation through ex- trinsic factors in other individuals, is basic to an understanding of gregariousness, both in animals and in human beings. Attachments are biologically necessary, not merely for repro- duction, but for initial survival and development. The degree of attachment, of course, varies from species to species. Ob- servations among sheep, often used as the stereotype of flock- formation, offer some clues to the natural history of this tendency. Lambs, born at a relatively advanced state of development, follow the mother quite early, and, by weaning time, have formed quite a habit-pattern of following. Accord- ing to observers, when a small flock of sheep moves about, the oldest female is commonly found at the head of the line, her offspring and theirs following her.9 Naturally, these statements apply principally to the inter- pretation of social behavior only at very simple levels. At higher levels, we will need to know much more about inter- individual processes, and we shall need much greater knowl- edge about the individuals which make up a group. Here again, we shall need the definition of intrinsic patterns of behavior and a knowledge of the ways in which such patterns are affected and modified by different kinds and timing of external factors, that is, reactions from other individuals. The difficulties which observers of animal behavior ex- perience in their studies, and the humility and self-discipline which they bring to bear in formulating their conclusions, also offer valuable lessons to the social scientist. Teleological and anthropomorphic tendencies still plague us. In philosophy, the problem of teleology cannot be avoided ; it is the doctrine of "ends," and it is respectable. In scientific investigation, however, it is confusing and misleading. Unconsciously per- haps, thinking along the lines of "purposiveness" creeps in, not only among evolutionists and functional biologists, but with considerable prevalence, and not inconsiderable harm, 7.

The scientist's legitimate primary question is "How does something happen? What are the factors under which it happens?" The evolutionist also asks "Why?" in the sense of "How come?" rather than "What for?" or "For what purpose?"10 As long as we con- tinue to observe behavior in terms of noting what takes place first, what follows, with what regularity and with what fre- quency and intensity, we are on solid ground. Our interpreta- tions then are more likely to be in terms of cause and effect, with speculations, more or less accurate, about value and usefulness. The minute that we begin to interpret behavior in terms of an implied "purpose," or explain that something has happened "in order to . . .," we have suggested a psy- chological cause of some kind behind events which somehow anticipates the actual functioning itself. Purposiveness is really a higher-level psychological ability involving a kind of foresight demonstrated only in higher animals, and in all probability far less frequently present in everyday human behavior than is commonly assumed. How often human beings are accused by each other of having "deliberately" said or done something which, upon inquiry, turns out to have happened involuntarily or unconsciously or as a result of impulse rather than of thought. In objective physiology, life processes seem to develop in a certain direction, or have a tendency to re-establish conditions within the organism when these have been disturbed, but do not necessarily have identi- fiable ends or goals. Even if they do, in our present state of relative ignorance, we certainly gravely encumber our think- ing and even retard our progress toward knowledge by con- cerning ourselves with purposiveness. To paraphrase Konrad Lorenz, so-called finality is only a directive arrow, which we ourselves paint on events post facto .n The real nature of phenomena is frequently blurred by our over- readiness to interpret behavior (animal and human) in anthropomorphic terms, or with words that have as yet no precise meaning. A phrase such as "The animal is searching to ..." is a common example of a human being's attributing to an animal behavior-content like his own. What are we really describing when we talk of motivation? Drives and urges? Possibly the safest words that we can use are on the order of "readiness to act" or "tendency to," based upon repeated observations indicating a likelihood that such and such behavior is probable following certain other behavior. A striking example of the difficulties inherent in trying to grasp the nature of behavior in species other than ourselves (or even in other individual human beings, for that matter), was illustrated by the work of Hertz12 concerning the nature of a bee's selection of certain flowers, and the subsequent correction by Wolf13 in terms of the nature of a bee's visual apparatus. It took considerable effort to break away from the 10. "Group Processes," pp. 80-1. Material presented by Dr. Ernst Mayr, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University. 11.

Hertz' original idea was that the bee responded to certain forms, for example, a broken outline in preference to a smooth outline. There was no doubt that the bee demonstrated such a preference. However, Wolf per- formed a series of experiments based upon knowledge of the specific physiology of the bee's retina, that the bee responds to flickering and movement. He was then able to see that the bee does not respond to form as such, but to forms which induce greater flickering while the bee is in flight.14 The importance and applicability of the principles cur- rently being struggled with and clarified, need hardly be stressed. On the one hand, it is encouraging and supportive to those of us who have to develop theories concerning human behavior, to find many of our own concepts being independent- ly arrived at by investigators in the animal behavior field. It 14. "Group Processes," pp. 136, ff. Material presented by Dr. Daniel S. Lehrman, Department of Psychology, Rutgers University. would please Harry Stack Sullivan, for example, to learn that his theory of interpersonal relations is now finding such confirmation in the studies of mother-newborn relationships in goats and in humans. Similarly, we can be grateful to the animal psychologists for calling to our attention the relevance and significance of factors which are natural units for their observation, such as basic patterns, timing, frequency, intensity and modifiability under specific conditions, patterns which we assume and often use, but which are extremely difficult for us to isolate and test in the highly-complicated individual and social situations which we attempt to analyze. Basically, the problems which the animal, behavior psychologist, the an- thropologist, the sociologist, and the psychiatrist study are the same problems. The methods which we use are different in each discipline. Each has a contribution to make to the other ; the anthropologist, sociologist and human psychologist describe complicated behavior even though they cannot always explain its components, and are often confused by its com- plexities. The animal-behavior investigator, through his deal- ing with the biological substrate of behavior and by the rigorous discipline which he must exercise in unraveling and explaining phenomena, has much to give to the social scientist.
