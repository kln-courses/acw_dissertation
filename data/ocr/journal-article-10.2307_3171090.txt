<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alvaro Siza Three Projects Alvaro Siza Vieira is an architect in Porto, Portugal. Borges &amp; Irmao Bank, Vila do Conde, Portugal, 1979-1986 In this small branch bank at Vila do Conde, initially planned in 1979, many of the formal considerations evident in Alvaro Siza's unbuilt works for the Kreuzberg district of Berlin gain form and substance. Here, the juxta- position of unlike elements serves as a means of relating a new work to a preexisting context. Announcing a ramped street cut into the block, the public nature of the work is asserted through an architectural language that sets itself off from surrounding residential and institutional buildings. This work is at once towering and low, massive and deli- cate, cavernous and transparent. A strong material pres- ence, Siza's building explores the enigma of space itself. It actively recedes to the periphery of vision in a play of presence and absence - virtually disappearing, merging with its surroundings by cross views that cut transversely through the constructed area, vanishing on a line only to reemerge as a weighty mass. Here the world of numerical accumulation and banking takes place within an interior permeated by a sense of impermanence. P.T. 63</page><page sequence="2">1 (frontispiece).

Alvaro Siza, Duarte House, sketch of view from the street Duarte House, Ovar, Portugal, 1981-1985 Nowhere is the tension between tradition and actuality that pervades Alvaro Siza's work developed with more subtle re- straint and disarming clarity than in his recently completed Duarte House. Physically removed from the nearby provin- cial town of Ovar and estranged from the once continuous tradition of building that formed its distant surroundings, the Duarte House nevertheless develops a set of unex- pected correspondences. Hovering enigmatically on its site, this suburban villa discretely houses its multiple aspects within a silent and urbane volume. Here two essential characteristics of the dwelling come together: the elemental shelter in nature and the house as an element of urban construction. Loosian in the contrast between its mute ex- terior and labyrinthine interior, the Duarte House opens inward and upward, unfolding within a dense, three- dimensional space. P.T.

Side view of ground- level fireplace 85</page><page sequence="25">assemblage 2 Faculty of Architecture, Pavilion, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal, 1985-1986 Set within a raised and walled garden of what was once a private villa overlooking the estuary of the Douro River, Alvaro Siza's most recently completed work represents the initial phase of a major commission for the Faculty of Ar- chitecture of the University of Porto. To date, Siza's work here has included the recuperation and transformation of two preexisting structures and the construction of a pavil- ion serving as studio spaces. Within this walled compound a dialogue is established between old and new: between discrete elements - building and garden - between the site's former use as a residence and its present use as an emerging institution. The pavilion, realized under severe time and cost con- straints, represents a condensation of Siza's "temporal design process." Beginning with the most rational response to the problem posed, Siza's first proposal involves a linear scheme situated below the existing villa, leaving the garden untouched. Rigorously dimensioned in response to its in- tended use and conditioned by material and economic exi- gencies, this initial scheme was progressively transformed. As permission to build in this location was denied, in a second stage the proposal was moved to the other extremity of the garden and aligned with the high boundary wall that separates the site from a major highway. Interacting with the conditions of this new site - the irregular outline of the stone boundary wall, existing trees, the alignments of paths and built elements - the originally linear scheme is bent and buckled to form a courtyard. A defined object within a defined space emerges, a work both autonomous and involved with its surroundings. Crouched behind a massive tree at the rear of the garden, the pavilion peers out across an expanse of lawn toward the house and river beyond. The organic quality of its form and physiognomy is not merely graphic. As in the count- less buildings that inhabit the Portuguese countryside, Si- za's anthropomorphism manifests an essential parallelism between man and nature - between man and the things he makes.
