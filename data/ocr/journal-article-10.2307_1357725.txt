<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Burnt House at Arpachiyah: A Reexamination STUART CAMPBELL Department of Art History and Archaeology University of Manchester Oxford Road Manchester M13 9PL Great Britain stuart.campbell@man.ac.uk Mallowan's excavations at Arpachiyah in northern Iraq in 1933 uncovered a Burnt House at the summit of the mound. Although the importance of the discovery has been recognized ever since as vital evidence for society in the late Halaf (mid-fifth millen- nium B.C.; ca. 5300 cal B.C.) in northern Mesopotamia, the basic data have never been reviewed and no comprehensive interpretation has been put forward. Using both pub- lished and unpublished material, this article attempts to review the evidence and pro- pose a new interpretation, based on the current knowledge of the period. It is suggested that the Burnt House was the last in a series of structures where exchange-of obsidian, among other commodities-took place within a formalized social context, and it was through this role that Arpachiyah acted as a center of regional integration. The destruc- tion of the Burnt House may have been a deliberate, ritual act. INTRODUCTION A rpachiyah is a small, superficially insignifi- cant tell now surrounded by a housing estate on the edge of a village just outside the ur- ban sprawl of Mosul in northern Iraq. It is an unlikely spot for one of the key prehistoric sites of the Near East. It was the first excavation of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, directed by Max Mallowan in 1933 and published with remarkable speed two years later (Mallowan and Rose 1935). The discov- eries of that excavation are regularly referred to and the artifacts republished in books and articles. There was also a small later excavation by Ismail Hijara in 1976 (Hijara, Watson, and Hubbard 1980; Hijara 1997). In many ways, though, the site has been rather neglected. Virtually no attempt has been made to reexamine what was actually found nor to funda- mentally reassess or reinterpret the more spectacular discoveries in the light of recent knowledge. Almost always, more recent interpretations have been based on Mallowan's conclusions and usually illustrated from the original report.1 The major period of occupation at Arpachiyah was between the Halaf lb (ca. 5000 b.c.; ca. 5800 cal B.C.,2 Campbell 1992) and the Ubaid (ca. 4200 b.c.; ca. 5100 cal B.C.). In many ways, this is a critical phase in the development of complex society in the Near East. By the end of the fourth millennium, Mesopotamia had moved from having a developed Neolithic society to one on the brink of urbanism, with most of the key elements of state-level society already in place. Yet we know very little of the pro- cesses involved. In the Halaf, it has proved difficult to define the degree of regional integration present or the extent of centralized control or social hier- archies. Although it has been frequently suggested that Halaf society represents a chiefdom, the evi- dence used to support this is thin, and mechanisms that might articulate the meaning of that general description have barely been explored. After the earlier set of excavations, Tell Arpa- chiyah was by far the most important site for the interpretation of the Halaf culture, and to an extent it still is. In addition to its being, for a long time, the only stratified sequence available, it also was home 1The previously unpublished photographs in Curtis (1981) are one notable exception. 2All dates are given as both uncalibrated b.c. and cali- brated B.C. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 to a unique discovery: a building from the end of the Halaf occupation which had burnt down, an event that preserved many of its contents. This assemblage of objects was immediately recognized as outstand- ing. In particular, the pottery sets standards of excel- lence in prehistoric pottery that are difficult to parallel anywhere else and, rightly, have a prominent place in the development of ceramic art. Much of the rest of the assemblage is of equal quality. Despite this prom- inence, very little effort has been made to reexamine the role of the Burnt House, either within the settle- ment of Arpachiyah or within the wider context of fifth millennium society. The contradiction between the small size of the site and its possible importance has not been explored in any detail. Even the new evidence from Hijara's excavation is not fully set in the context of the previous excavations, and the interpretation barely touches on the burnt building. There has never been an attempt to draw up a com- plete catalog of the material in the Burnt House nor to analyze this material as a single assemblage. It is hoped that such an analysis will contribute at least partially to our understanding of late Halaf society. This article originates in an attempt, conceived in the mid-1980s, to completely republish all the material from the site in the light of more recent dis- coveries and using the limited archive records.3 That more ambitious study is suspended because of the difficulty of completing work on the material in Iraq. This article has a more limited focus and concen- trates on the TT6 Burnt House for which, unlike for the rest of the site, there is a substantial body of ma- terial that can be tied to a particular architectural context. The reevaluation is based on a study of most of the artifacts from TT6, the original excavation records, and the publications of both Mallowan and Hijara. Tell Arpachiyah is a small site, not much more than 125 m in diameter and standing 5.5 m above the surrounding area. Mallowan excavated Arpachiyah for six weeks in the spring of 1933 (fig. 1; Mallo- wan and Rose 1935). He employed a huge team with minimal supervision: up to 180 workmen and at most two archaeological supervisors on site, although a few foremen with extensive experience were also employed. It is indicative of the potential problems, recognized even at that time, that work was started on the outer part of the mound to "enable the men, at least half of whom had not been employed on excavations before, to obtain some initial training" (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 8). It is not surprising that almost no structures were found in these outer areas. Deliberately, and fortunately, the center of the mound was excavated last, with rather better trained workmen. Because of this and because of the un- usual nature of the finds, it was better recorded as well. As far as a detailed analysis of the function of the site is concerned, only this central area can be used from the 1933 excavations. The site was reex- cavated in 1976 by Hijara using a long and stepped slit trench running from the extant summit of the mound down to natural soil (fig. 2; Hijara, Watson, and Hubbard 1980; Hijara 1997). THE BURNT HOUSE The sixth level from the top of the mound was designated TT6 (TT stands for "Top of Tepe"). A building, partly destroyed by fire and containing a large number of objects, was the major structure in TT6. In the original records, this is generally re- ferred to as the "TT6 Burnt House" or, sometimes, the "TT6 Burnt Room." Mallowan recorded over 150 objects of a wide variety of types lying on the floor of two rooms; depending on how the objects are counted, it would be easy to arrive at a much larger total. Although I will discuss the contents of the room in more detail below, the majority of these ob- jects are extremely and often uniquely fine, including the famous polychrome plates. Many of the objects have remained either incompletely published, or com- pletely unpublished because, owing to various polit- ical difficulties, Mallowan was unable to reexamine the objects that were assigned to Iraq in the division of the finds. Previous Interpretations The main interpretations are quite restricted and have rarely been developed in any detail. Mallowan 3The primary archive material consists of a volume of notes (Mallowan, Arpachiyah Records), a significant num- ber of photographs (Mallowan, Photographs Vol. I), and Mallowan's original small finds record (Mallowan, Small Finds Record) held in the British Museum and the original finds division list kept in the Iraq Museum. There is some additional material in the British Museum. The original publication, the British Museum accessions catalog, and the Iraq Museum accessions catalog include information not present in the primary archive material, and it is assumed that this information, recorded close to the time of excava- tion, is either based on records now lost or on firsthand knowledge. In many cases, there is additional information either written directly on artifacts or on scraps of paper kept with the artifacts.</page><page sequence="3">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 3 E.W Ext E C?

LeBlanc and Watson have interpreted it simply as a chief's house but without elaboration (Watson and LeBlanc 1973). Additional suggestions, not elaborated in detail, are its function as a store- room for a community's wealth or as the treasury of a local chief (Roaf 1990: 49). Maisels adds the hy- pothesis that, within a nonhierarchical network of settlements, the Burnt House might have served as "a kind of 'central emporium' where settlements 'in credit'... could have drawn on resources coming from any part of the network" (Maisels 1999: 143). Its destruction was ascribed by Mallowan to invad- ing peoples of the Ubaid culture (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 106), an idea that has almost universally been rejected since, although an alternative cause of de- struction has rarely been specifically proposed. Cer- tainly, it seems unlikely that any invaders would have been Ubaid as the pottery does not represent the final Halaf phase, but the possibility of destruction in some sort of hostilities has never been convincingly</page><page sequence="4">4 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 Iti . Mallowan's Trench 0 (probable) Hijara's Trench / 0_ 1Om " . Fig. 2. Hijara's 1976 contour plan and trench, with probable area of Mallowan's excavations overlaid. disproved. The most innovative, and perhaps most interesting, theory has been advanced by Munchaev, who suggested that it was a ritual cremation, although Mallowan specifically rejected this (see Mallowan 1977: 96 for reference to Munchaev's theory; see also Oates 1978: 119). There are a number of problems associated with these interpretations. The most basic is that they are not based on the nature of the building, the actual finds, or the detailed context of deposition; rather they are based on Mallowan's interpretation of the evidence as presented and emphasized in the origi- nal report. Secondly, the implications of the inter- pretation of the Burnt House have not been followed through and integrated with what we know of the Halaf in general. The Data It should be emphasized that the evidence is less than ideal. Other studies of more recently excavated material from contexts with large quantities of in situ material and possible ritual associations have empha- sized the value of complete and detailed recording of the objects themselves, their context and relation- ship with one another, and the nature of the surround- ing context in which they were set (e.g., Peltenburg 1991; Stevanovid 1997; Verhoeoven 1999). Very lit- tle is known of the exact distribution of the objects within the Burnt House. Insufficient information is available on the nature of the burning and the ar- chitecture of the building. There are no faunal or botanical remains. It also seems certain that not all the artifacts originally in the Burnt House were lo- cated. Many small objects must have been missed without systematic retrieval methods. Indeed, many small finds from the site are simply recorded as being found on the spoil heap. It seems likely that some of the material supposedly from TT5 (e.g., A1004; fig. 7:2) may have originated in the upper fill of TT6 be- fore its significance was realized (see, in particular, discussion of bowl A1004 below). Conversely, where</page><page sequence="5">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 5 . . . .., . - . . . .???? ?:?? . . . . . . . : . . . . . : . ... . . . . ..i . . . . . . . .?? . .. . . . . . . . : . . . .. . : '. .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . : . 1. . . .. . . . . . . : . . . . . . . . : ...? . .. . . .. . . . . . :- . . .:.: ? ... . . . . - . . .: : : . . . . . : . ....:. .1. . . .. . . . .. :::::: . - ": . .: . - . . . . .. .. . ...:. . . . . ... . . .. . ... . . . . . . . : : . : .. . . . : :. ... . . .. . . .. .. . . . . . . . . . . . ? . : . ... .. - - . - - . . - - . .. . . . .. . . . . . . . . .. . : . . , . .. ,S.- . . ... 1 N. . .. . . . . .. . .. . ..: . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . .... . .. . . . . . ......: . . ... . . .. . . . .. .I . . : . .

Fig. 3. 3D projection of the TT6 Burnt House. an artifact is recorded as simply coming from TT6, we cannot be certain that it comes from the Burnt House-it may come from elsewhere in that level, although that remains much the most likely location. Damage, cleaning, and restoration that may have oc- curred during fifty years in museum storage hinders detailed examination of the objects. It was particu- larly difficult to examine some of the material that remained in Iraq, much of which had been distrib- uted among various regional museums.4 Furthermore, incomplete records were kept of the distribution of the material that was exported-objects are distrib- uted among multiple institutions in Britain, New Zealand, Canada, and Australia, as well as given to a few private individuals. Although most of the arti- facts have been traced, a few have not yet been found and examined. Nonetheless, a core data set can be isolated from which we may hope to draw plausible conclusions. The Structures The Burnt House is in a very prominent position at the summit of what was by that date a low mound. There seem to have been paths made from close packed pebbles, some of which are almost certainly contemporary with TT6, leading to the center of the site (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 21, pl. 1:b). These fur- ther emphasize the nature of the Burnt House as a focal point of the settlement. The layout of the TT6 building is rambling with no immediately obvious plan (fig. 3). This may be complicated by an excava- tion technique that may have failed to distinguish 4lndeed, given the events of recent years it is doubtful if all the material, some of which had been dispersed to provincial museums, still survives (Baker, Matthews, and Postgate 1993).</page><page sequence="6">6 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 between adjacent units. Parts of the building are of a significant size; the long room that contained many of the objects is approximately 10 m by 3 m and had walls 0.5 m thick. In the levels below TT6 there was a series of circular buildings-the structures that encouraged Mallowan to use the misleading name of "tholos." Accordingly, TT6, with its rectangular architecture, has traditionally been seen as a radical change in the architectural traditions of the site. In TT8, a single tholos was excavated with a 10 m external diameter and 1-m-wide walls built on a foundation of river boulders. This was reconstructed on the same plan in TT7, and part of a second massive tholos at this level was also found. Mallowan argues that because of their size and position, "it may therefore be taken for granted that they [the tholoi] were buildings of outstanding importance" (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 34). He suggests, furthermore, that the absence of later disturbance, the presence of two rich graves, and the discovery of several female figurines in the vicinity all point to the sanctity of the buildings. Hijara subsequently followed this argument, adding his suggestion of a central tholos precinct (discussed below), more unusual burials, and the observation that the fill of the tholoi seems to be of clean red clay rather than more usual cultural debris (Hijara 1978: 127-28). He further argues that the invest- ment of labor in the construction of these founda- tions would have required a significant mobilization of labor (Hijara 1978). In contrast, Akkermans has argued against this interpretation, pointing out that the figurines and burials are not directly associated with the tholoi and that the tholos precinct enclosure and the clean fill were only seen in very restricted areas (Akkermans 1993: 300-302). In particular he argues, convincingly, that the stone foundations of the tholoi, probably carried from the river Khosr about 3 km west of the site, need not have involved such a major investment of labor. There remains, however, a previously unremarked but possibly more convincing reason to suggest that these tholoi may have had some particular status. If one superimposes the plan of the TT6 buildings on that of TT7, it is clear that the long, northern room of TT6 is on exactly the same plan as the antecham- ber of the TT7 tholos (fig. 4). TT6 is perhaps better thought of as a reconstruction of TT7 on a slightly different plan rather than as a radical change in ar- chitecture. This runs against traditional assumptions in that the part of the TT7 structure that shows con- tinuity, and may therefore be the most important room, is not the tholos but its rectangular attach- ment. Mallowan states that "the foundations of the potter's shop [the Burnt House] rested directly upon those of the older level of destroyed buildings in TT7" (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 17; contra Akker- mans 1993: 302). Indeed, some unpublished photo- graphs in the British Museum and the section in the original publication (Mallowan and Rose 1935: fig. 4) indicate that some of the walls of the TT6 build- ing may have been below the tops of the TT7 tholos foundations, which suggests that the later building may even have been an alteration of a standing build- ing rather than a reconstruction. It may not be en- tirely irrelevant that the concept of reconstructing a building on a preexisting ground plan is familiar from later Mesopotamian archaeology, particularly for religious buildings. The Burnt House must have been only the last in a series of important structures with a shared significance. It is possible that the con- tents of these earlier buildings were comparable with those of the TT6 Burnt House but were simply not preserved. Hijara's Interpretation Hijara has argued that the TT6 building, and the central area of the site in the preceding levels, con- stituted a distinct area within the settlement of Ar- pachiyah, marked off by a boundary wall and with little or no building activity in the outer part of the site (Hijara 1978: 127; 1997; Hijara, Watson, and Hubbard 1980: 134). Given the small size of Hijara's trench, projecting a boundary wall around the top of the tell seems very conjectural. If the section of Hijara's trench is stud- ied (Hijara, Watson, and Hubbard 1980: figs. 3-5), the so-called enclosure wall is easily seen between the points marked 30 m and 35 m and is recorded as being a thick mass of tauf, or packed mud. While it is undeniable that it could be a wall, the trench in which it was found is only 2.5 m wide which is scarcely wide enough to argue that it is a wall rather than a mound of tauf of a different nature. Moreover, the reason why Hijara detected little or no later in- habitation in the outer part of the site is probably simple: it had already been removed in the 1933 excavations. The point at which there is a break in habitation is at about the 40 m mark on Hijara's pub- lished section (Hijara, Watson, and Hubbard 1980: figs. 4-5). It is clear from a combination of Hijara's</page><page sequence="7">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 7 STT6 0 10m [ TT7 Fig. 4. Plan of TT6 Burnt House superimposed on the plan of the TT7 tholoi. overall plan, Mallowan and Rose's overall plan, and several published and unpublished aerial photographs that this is almost exactly the edge of one of the trenches of the 1933 excavations (fig. 2). Mallowan's unpublished notes in the British Museum5 make it clear that up to 4 m of deposit was removed in this area, which probably accounts for all of the phases of occupation apparently missing on the outer part of the tell. Therefore, I suggest that we have to assume that the outer areas of the site were occupied when the TT6 building was in use. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARTIFACTS The objects seem to have been concentrated in two rooms of the Burnt House, one referred to as the "long room," the other as the "full room." The former is certainly the large, long room on the northeastern side of the building. The other is not exactly speci- fied, but may be the adjacent room. Although the term "full room" suggests that it contained most of the objects, this may be incorrect. Most of the ob- jects for which there is any indication of location are specified as coming from the long room. It is notable that this room may be the primary one and is also the room that preserves the plan, and perhaps the significance, of the preceding buildings. The finds were scattered around the rooms, some close to the walls, others not; some individually and some in groups. Some of the artifacts were found on charcoal, which Mallowan plausibly interprets to in- dicate that they had been placed on tables or shelves around the room. The few photographs show objects that are lying in groups but do not appear to be close to a wall (Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 21:b; Mal- lowan, Photographs I: photos M412, M516, and M520 in particular). Unfortunately it is now impos- sible to reconstruct the original locations of more than a few of the objects. 5This is clear in the archive volume (Mallowan, Ar- pachiyah Records: 178, 188, in particular) and from depths recorded on sherds.</page><page sequence="8">8 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 .. . ... ... i-:!:x::,: IKZW ? i: i K 01 -'s fF:;1:ii iiiiiii. i ?.::?:::.i~i ili?:?.; li~ii'I :MI !-s IMi~l Z?;i is, tsi i, W. f ?:::"M tits: iii~liiiiriii':~liC,~illlll~~re"ss- ils ijii, ;':: ::~i??::: ??;: "l~ci:jiii~i~iiia'i.F~i:isil; It Iist :~::::? :~??:i::iiIiif.: int:iilI!z At ?i T~:?: ? :?ol NN-4,1 iW ;WI, lu f it: Ro -;s~' f. - XV r il ;;;I: I' If,: fl f. i E ?Z.iii ????,iiii~j~i~iil'';it ay- AA:i:' iiriliirii::ig'1f;;pfnfng -ri vs b . ........ . i.,M :Mmrix iis.; -4 "R N't" I....jiii i F i:z 47 i F i iiijj .... .... .... . .......... . - 'Eiiiim RZI; i X: .::-ii . . ..... ...

Mal- lowan states that the southern portion suffered the most (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 106). This contrast is extremely marked in the condition of the artifacts: some are heavily burnt but others are completely unmarked. This may indicate that the burning was only partial and that the fire may have been halted by the collapse of the roof of the building, either accidentally or deliberately. NATURE OF THE OBJECTS The finds can be discussed in rough groups. Much of the most important information is not included in the original publication, and some categories of finds are omitted entirely there. Pottery Plates The best-known artifacts are the highly deco- rated pottery plates. Among them are thirteen poly- chrome plates, manufactured and decorated with exceptional care and skill. Remarkably, not all of these are published in the original report (figs. 5-6). Together with another polychrome example, re- corded from TT5 but which probably originates in the Burnt House (A1004; fig. 7:2), and six fine monochrome plates, these plates form a distinct group. Most of the polychrome plates are decorated in only two colors, but four examples have addi- tional white paint. The quality of this group is un- paralleled at any other Halaf site in terms of form, fabric, and decoration.</page><page sequence="9">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 9 .i.e It U Fig. 6. Polychrome plate A529. (Photograph courtesy of the British Museum.) There is a considerable degree of homogeneity within this group of open plates. The forms are clearly related, although there are specific variations and a considerable range in the dimensions. Plates A748 and A749 have more complex profiles (Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 19:1, fig. 54:4). Some have much wider bases and steeper angles on the walls (e.g., A745 and A751; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pls. 17:b, 18). However, the similarity in dimensions of the largest plates is striking. Plates A746, A753, A750, A749, A748, A752, and A528 form a very tight group in terms of diameter, especially if A515 is consid- ered as being a slightly different shape and therefore set aside (Mallowan and Rose 1935: fig. 56:2). If it does come from the Burnt House, A1004 would also fit in this group. In terms of the height of the ves- sels, these pieces are also very similar, with the pos- sible exception of A528, for which the height had to be estimated from a photograph and may be too low. An alternative, looser grouping might be those plates with a diameter of over about 240 mm. This would add to the group A529 (fig. 6), a trichrome plate; perhaps A751 (Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 22:10), a rather low bichrome plate; and A754 (Mal- lowan and Rose 1935: pl. 19:4), a fine monochrome plate. The general scheme of decoration is identical in all cases. The interior is the main focus and very little of it is left without decoration; indeed in most cases very little of the original vessel surface is left unpainted at all. With the exception of A528 (fig. 5), there is a strong central motif which is usually some form of rosette but may be what Mallowan refers to as a "Maltese Square" (A751; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 22:10) or a group of bukrania (A515, which is a slightly different shape from the other examples; Mallowan and Rose 1935: fig. 56:2). The walls of the interiors are covered with tight hori- zontal bands of densely painted and visually comple- mentary motifs. This unit of composition is unusual.</page><page sequence="10">10 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 In other Halaf examples of plates, the decoration, although mainly in the interior, is somewhat sparser and more open. The exteriors of the plates are more plainly decorated, either with parallel bands or a bi- chrome design of triangles, as with A528 (fig. 5) and A752 (Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 15). There are certain designs that recur in the deco- ration of the plates. Two of the plates are identical (A742 and A743; Mallowan and Rose 1935: fig. 57:1). Stippled circles are frequent, occurring on three vessels as the uppermost band of interior dec- oration. In two cases this is on vessels decorated in three colors, associated with the use of small rosettes in the next horizontal band and with a bichrome, tri- angular design on the exterior of the vessel. Nega- tive designs occur in three cases (A745, A750, and A751; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pls. 17b, 18); each is associated with the same external motif and, in the first two cases, with bands of cross-hatching made up of horizontal and vertical lines. Rosettes are com- monly used in this group, not just as a central motif, but also as a component in the checkerboarding and bands. None of these motifs are unique within the Halaf ceramic tradition, but their frequency here is unusually high. Therefore, this group of plates has a strong de- gree of internal similarity. It can be suggested, with some degree of confidence, that at least a subgroup of these plates may have been made by a single pot- ter of great technical skill. This subgroup would in- clude A748, A753, A746, A750, A752, A528, A529, A1004, and, possibly, A749 and A745. Others of the group of fine plates may also have originated in this group, but they lack the very close similarities in shape and form that occur within it. This core sub- group of eight to ten large plates probably had a sin- gle use. The quality of the plates and their context suggest that this function was high status. The gen- eral lack of use-wear suggests that they were only used on specific occasions, most probably in formal social rituals. A relatively small group of motifs was employed in a consistent and interrelated manner on these vessels. This homogeneity may be simply stylistic, but the decorative motifs may also have carried quite specific meanings, perhaps conveying messages relating to the contexts in which they were used. Most of the plates are broken, some of them very extensively and one into 76 pieces (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 107). These plates must always have been fragile and, in the destruction of the build- ing, would almost inevitably have been damaged. That this damage sometimes happened in situ as a result of the pressure from the surrounding depos- its is shown by the only illustration of in situ finds (Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 21:b): three plates can be seen, clearly extensively broken but undisturbed. However, some plates seem to have been broken and their pieces scattered before being burnt. This is particularly clear in the cases of A529, A750, A752, A753, and A754 where conjoining sherds have been burnt to radically different temperatures and in dif- ferent atmospheres (e.g., A529 in fig. 6). This might have occurred because a plate was dropped from a table or shelf or even shattered during the burning of the building. Mallowan, however, states that some of the sherds from a single vessel were found at oppo- site ends of the room (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 106). If we accept the accuracy of Mallowan's ob- servations, he must be correct that these pieces were broken and scattered deliberately. Such deliberate breakage must have been selective rather than com- prehensive as not all artifacts or even all plates were affected. One fragmentary plate (A1004; fig. 7:2) recon- structed from a number of burnt sherds is almost certainly from the Burnt House but is recorded as being found in TT5. It was probably excavated be- fore the rest of the Burnt House had been identified, either through inaccuracy of recording or because it was lying on the top of the TT6 deposit. It differs from other plates in that the edges of the individual sherds are very worn. The most likely explanation is that, after the destruction of the Burnt House, this area of the site was abandoned. The sherds may have lain on the surface or eroded out, and the edges may have become worn through exposure. A gap in occupation after TT6 has been suggested previously, although not from the same or from such conclusive evidence (Davidson and McKerrell 1980: 164; Cur- tis 1981: 33). Other Pottery In addition to these fine plates, there was a con- siderable quantity of other pottery. Some of this was also extremely fine. The two bichrome jars (A512, A739; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 20:a-b) are par- ticularly notable. There were also two fragmentary champagne vases, probably A526 and A527 (Mal- lowan and Rose 1935: 136). The former is recorded in the small finds list as being decorated with stippled</page><page sequence="11">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 11 2 Scale 1:2 Fig. 7. Plates probably from TT6. 1: A 1003; 2: A 1004 (hatched paint is red-brown).</page><page sequence="12">12 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 circles but has not been traced. A fragmentary and unnumbered bow-rim jar in the Institute of Archae- ology, London, again decorated with stippled cir- cles, probably came from the Burnt House as well. The stippled circles on extremely well-made pottery are reminiscent of the decoration on several of the polychrome plates and emphasize the stylistic links within the assemblage. In addition to this fine pottery, there were also a considerable number of vessels that, although by no means crude, are more typical of a Halaf ceramic as- semblage. These include a considerable number of small pots and bowls. Two very similar jars are note- worthy (figs. 8:2-3). From the differential burning visible on the exteriors, both must have been sitting at an angle when they were burnt rather than on their flat bases. Was the Burnt House in some disarray be- fore the fire took place? Both these jars and several of the other, non-fine ware vessels have clear signs of wear, particularly chips around the rims. These broken areas are themselves worn and must repre- sent the results of wear and tear in the normal life of a vessel. These plain, more heavily used pots may represent the typical component of a normal Halaf dwelling. A contrast can be drawn between the often extensive wear on these plainer vessels and the ab- sence of such on the fine plates. A few of the smaller and less fine plates have traces of wear, especially scraping in the center of the vessel, presumably where food was scooped up. The finest and largest of the plates appear to have minimal or no wear vis- ible in this area. Stone Vessels Nine stone vessels were present. Stone vessels generally occur consistently but in small numbers in Halaf sites. This rarity may be due to their being stronger than pottery vessels and therefore discarded less often, but it may also reflect their greater value. In any case, nowhere else has such a large number been found together. Of particular note is the obsid- ian jar (A411; Mallowan and Rose 1935: fig. 44:15). This is an exceptional object, although there are now Halaf parallels for obsidian vessels from Domuz- tepe in southeast Turkey (Campbell et al. 1999: fig. 16). Mallowan states that the vessel may have been unfinished or broken in manufacture. There is no specific indication of this; certainly its two frag- ments were found lying together, suggesting that they were simply broken in the destruction of the building (Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 22:b). Jewelry Large quantities of items that could loosely be considered jewelry were found. These include large numbers of simple beads (A877, A878, A879, and A880; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 6:b). Very few of these have been traced in museums. Therefore the identifications suggested by Mallowan-that they contain examples in exotic materials (steatite, car- nelian, and serpentine are all mentioned)-must re- main unconfirmed and unquantified. However, there are certainly also some more exotic items. Among them is a necklace of cowrie shells and obsidian links apparently found lying in the order that they have been restrung (fig. 9). Mallowan notes that the shells were originally filled in with red ocher. How- ever, the deposits that remain in the shells give no indication of this but seem to be a mixture of red- dish ash and tauf which may reflect the deposits that surrounded them. The obsidian links in the neck- lace are technologically paralleled by the consider- able number of other obsidian links found in a group (A905 and A906; fig. 10; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 11 :b). Once again, these indicate a technology of obsidian polishing and grinding that is very different from standard Halaf lithic manufacture. The sizes of the blades from which these links were made (at least 60 mm long and 30 mm wide) are very unusual in the Neolithic of northern Mesopotamia. The value of such links is emphasized by their absence from any other contexts at Arpachiyah and the scarcity of parallels within the Halaf. Specific parallels occur at Banahilk (Watson 1983: 573, fig. 10.4) and Yarim Tepe II (Munchaev, Merpert, and Bader 1984: 38, fig. 5:4) but these are all isolated finds. The cowrie shells in the necklace are clearly exotic, long-distance imports. Seals At least eleven seals were found (13 if A43 and A893b are included, although they may not be seals), but there were probably more; six more have the am- biguous location of TT6-7 and two come from TT5. The seals are typical Halaf stamp seals with linear incised designs, but it should be noted that this is by far the largest concentration found in any Halaf site (cf. von Wickede 1990). All of the seals that I have been able to study have signs of long use, usu- ally visible as a very high polish on raised areas. Two are of particular interest. One is broken (A867; Mal- lowan and Rose 1935: fig. 51:11), but the break itself</page><page sequence="13">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 13 1 42 3 4 5K7V 6 7 Scale 1:2 Fig. 8.

The seal certainly continued in use for a considerable period after being damaged, sug- gesting that these seals were of considerable inherent importance. A second seal had been deliberately de- faced (A874; fig. 11:3): 1-2 mm of stone has been ground away from its face, leaving only faint traces of the original incised patterns around the edge. The small size of the seal seems to rule out secondary use. Instead, it has been deliberately taken out of use. Once again, this seems to emphasize the signifi- cance given to such seals. It was not enough for it simply to fall out of use; it also had to be destroyed. Seals had probably also been manufactured in or around the Burnt House. There is one seal with no design carved on it (A866; fig. 11:2), and two further unfinished seals were found in spoil from TT6 or TT7 (A41 and A578; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pls. 8:a, 7:a). Almost all Halaf seals have holes for suspension and wear marks consistent with rubbing for a long period, suggesting that they may have been worn about a person. They were probably associated with an individual or with an institution that that person represented. Typically they are found singly, and no</page><page sequence="15">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 15 1 2 3 e 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 Scale 1:2 Fig. 10.

It is tempting to suggest that an institution based in the Burnt House may have had some specific control over the use and availability of seals-manufactur- ing them and taking them out of circulation. Charvait has emphasized the possible personal associations of the use of Halaf seals and, in particular, a possible specific role in gift exchange (Charvait 1994: 13). At least one possibility is that the Burnt House had a central position in mediating such transactions. Sealings Twenty-seven burnt clay sealings were found but more may well have been missed. The stamp seals themselves are well known, but Halaf sealings are much less so, probably owing to accidents of sur- vival and excavation. The discovery of some 300 sealings at Tell Sabi Abyad from the late sixth mil- lennium (Akkermans and Duistermaat 1996) sug- gests that their use was much more widespread than suggested by the small number from Arpachiyah, Tepe Gawra (Tobler 1950), and Khirbet Derak (Bre- niquet 1996: pls. 56-60). In the Burnt House, they form two functional groups. The first type is a group of oval sealings wrapped around strings (the 19 seal- ings in group A619). This type seems to have been used in a standardized manner with impressions of a single seal evenly distributed, often in pairs, around the circumference of the sealing. The sealings of the second type are characteristically flat discs with the seal impression made into the upper surface (the eight sealings in group A620). The reverse usually has no marks to indicate what it was pressed onto. Von Wickede suggests these were pot lids-although as he points out, Halaf jars with sufficiently narrow necks are extremely rare-or control markers or to- kens (von Wickede 1990: 97). Fourteen of the seal- ings were impressed with the same hand-shaped seal (von Wickede 1990: 95). These include examples of both the first type of sealing (e.g., A619a-c; fig. 11: 4-5) and the second (e.g., A620d-e; von Wick- ede 1990: nos. 58-59). The impression of this seal is never found in combination with the impression of any other seals. There is no indication that the sealings were as- sociated with other objects that they might have sealed. Indeed, the number of sealings of the first type, impressed around cords, is much greater than the number of jars that might plausibly have been sealed. This suggests that the sealings were discarded after use, or even kept as an accounting system or, much more likely, that perishable goods were also kept in the Burnt House but did not survive. There are no sealings that match the patterns on any of the seals found in the Burnt House. Sealings were clearly used in a standardized and recognized manner to identify objects or goods. In a very general sense, this suggests the concept of own- ership and the beginnings of bureaucratic procedures to mark and control it. Charvait has argued that "the conditions under which a practice of sealing may be introduced exist only if the commodities sealed are transferred into different competence spheres" (Charvait 1988: 57). If so, a rather complex system was in operation, with material being passed to the Burnt House at Arpachiyah from other people or locations which in turn possessed some degree of control. The status and location of the owner(s) of the hand-shaped seal, which was the source of the most common impressions, are unknown but poten- tially critical. The social context in which the trans- fer between different spheres took place is unclear. It may have been asymmetric or symmetric exchange, or it may have been a form of central social storage; in either case formal or informal gift exchange was most probably involved. Certainly, the contexts in which seals and sealings were used are likely to have been embedded in the other social rituals that seem to have taken place in the Burnt House. Stone Axes Among the finds from the Burnt House are six stone axes, the largest concentration at a single find spot in the Halaf. The four that have been studied are all true axes with symmetrical profiles of the cutting edge. Two of these are heavily used with chipped and resharpened edges. Two more, which have not been traced, seem from Mallowan's small finds record to have been equally heavily worn. One ax is only very lightly worn but is otherwise unre- markable. The final example is more unusual (A666; fig. 12:4). It is small and very well made from an un- usual green stone. There is minimal sign of wear on the cutting edge, and the stone of which it was made is not hard enough to be suited to extensive use. It therefore seems probable that this had some prestige or ceremonial significance rather than being strictly functional.</page><page sequence="18">18 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 ?t / 7.f///.,  " /// i! ,.K?. ))?.

Miscellaneous Objects There was a group of objects found together at the one end of the Long Room (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 99, pl. 10:a). The objects include the figurines from the Burnt House (A921, A941; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 10:a, fig. 46:3), the collection of real and stone knuckle bones (A992; fig. 13:2-3; Mal- lowan and Rose 1935: fig. 52), and a small "steatite" trough (A923; Mallowan and Rose 1935: pl. 10:a). This group is enigmatic; it may be suggestive of ritual or cult but this can only be speculation. It may be significant that one figurine of each sex was present, despite the fact that distinctively male figu- rines are very rare in the Halaf. Not associated with this group were three (in the small finds catalog) or four (in the publication) stone objects, at least one of which is a very stylized anthropomorph (A904a:</page><page sequence="20">20 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 1 Scale :2 Scale 1:2 Fig. 14. Bone tubes. 1: A915a; 2: A915b; 3: A915c. fig. 13:1). The one that is not in Baghdad is def- initely of pumice, and two of the others may be. Their context and function are unclear. A second type of object that can usefully be con- sidered here is the four bone tubes (A915a-d; fig. 14:1-3). Two of these were found together at the west end of the Long Room, lying on charred wood (Mallowan, Arpachiyah Records: 243). The location of the other two is unknown. Only one is preserved to its full length, and it is possible but unlikely that two of the others may be opposite ends of the same object. These bone tubes have some characteristics in common. All are highly polished. This may well be through handling and, together with the heavily worn ends, may suggest a long period of use. Each has a small area of wear close to the end, where the outer surface of the bone is completely worn through. Groups of notches occur on one side of the two longer pieces and around the midpoint on the com- plete piece, although it is possible that these are a natural characteristic of the bone caused by stress (Nicola Murray, personal communication 1991). A stone mouthpiece, found as part of this group, may have a related use (A915e). A palette was found (A901; fig. 12:5), broken, probably in antiquity. Although this object is far from unique, with parallels at Kharabeh Shattani (Camp- bell 1995a: fig. 60:2) and Yarim Tepe (Merpert and Munchaev 1984: fig. 13:1), it is very well made from an extremely fine and colorful piece of banded lime- stone. Mallowan recorded it as being associated with a lump of red ocher which he interprets as evidence that pottery was painted in the building. This appears to be highly conjectural. There is little definitive evi- dence to associate such a palette with pottery painting, nor is there any other evidence of pottery manufac- ture in the Burnt House. A conical lump of lead, 42 mm high, was also recorded (A918). However, it was not possible to examine this in Baghdad. There are no other exam- ples of lead in a Halaf context, although there is a lead bracelet from Level 12 at Yarim Tepe I dating to the earlier sixth millennium (Merpert and Mun- chaev 1993: 114). It must be taken as an unusual,</page><page sequence="21">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 21 If -TIffig I'c yo, ,A;4 all Wl ROV A.

Obsidian cores (A911) from the Burnt House. and thereby potentially valuable, object as well as a rare piece of evidence of Halaf metallurgy. Chipped Stone Mallowan records "thousands of pieces of flint and obsidian cores and chips" in the Burnt House (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 105). It is very unfortu- nate that this component, numerically the most sig- nificant find of all from the Burnt House, is virtually unrecorded and that little of it can be traced in museums. Small finds A907, A908, A910, and A911 (fig. 15) can only represent a minute proportion of the total. Three additional objects, unusual tabular "chop- pers," exist in the Institute of Archaeology, London, and are marked as being from the Burnt House (A1001; fig. 12:1). Along with them are quantities of flakes of an identical flint, at least one of which can be joined to one of the "choppers." These objects, at least, were made in the building. The obsidian cores of A910 and A911 may well indicate that primary obsidian knapping took place in the Burnt House as well. There is a general absence or extreme rarity of obsidian cores at most other Halaf sites. The two usual explanations for this are either that obsidian was imported in the form of blades or that the knap- ping occurred in unexcavated areas of the sites. The presence of cores in the Burnt House at Arpachiyah is significant. It is the only material that does not fall into the categories of luxury, prestige goods, or normal domestic equipment. It is almost the only material for which there is real evidence for manu- facture, and the large quantities present are totally out of proportion with our expectations for this size of exposure. There is a large quantity of obsidian from Ar- pachiyah in the Institute of Archaeology, London. All of this material is technically unstratified. In view of the areas excavated by Mallowan, almost all must come from Halaf levels. It may, in theory, come from any part of the long sequence, but it seems almost certain that much (and possibly all) came from</page><page sequence="22">22 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 TABLE 1.

When examined in 1983, it was stored as though it came from a single collec- tion assembled in the field, and it was stored to- gether with A1001, which is known to have come from the Burnt House. It is very probable that if Mallowan was keeping any lithics, he would have kept them from here and, indeed, the only stratified lithics known from Arpachiyah come from the Burnt House. In a preliminary analysis,6 a sample of the as- semblage was divided into blades or bladelets (and tools on retouched blades) and debris from core preparation. This latter group consists of primary and secondary core preparation, some of the former retaining the outer surface of obsidian nodules (pati- nated, smoothed, and abraded). Each piece was ex- amined in transmitted natural light, and the color was categorized by the presence or absence of a green tinge. Almost all of those that are not green are gray, but a few are colorless or opaque. There are a small number of cores but it was impossible to examine their color systematically due to the thickness of the obsidian, although both green and gray obsidian cores are present. Although trace element analysis is generally used to determine the source of obsidian, color analysis allows a basic and rapid division between peralka- line and calc-alkaline obsidian as only the former produces green obsidian (Cann 1983: 234). Compar- isons between obsidian color and chemical sourcing in Anatolia suggest that this correlation is very high (Campbell 1992: 141-42; Healey, in prep.), and we know that the only peralkaline sources are Bing6l and Nemrut Dag near Lake Van. The gray obsidian from Arpachiyah could have come from several lo- cations but sources ig (the calc-alkaline sources at Bing61l) and 3a (Zernaki), both to the north of Lake Van, are attested in chemical analysis of material from the site (Renfrew, Dixon, and Cann 1966 and 1968 for the analyses; Chataigner 1998 for the lo- cation of the sources). There has been no chemi- cal analysis of green obsidian from Arpachiyah. The obsidian from Arpachiyah shows a clear and marked pattern. Among the core preparation sample, green obsidian outnumbers gray by a ratio of 19:1. For the finished blades the equivalent ratio is only 4:1. Among bladelets, gray obsidian is almost as com- mon as green. Green obsidian from Bing61l or Nem- rut Dag was being imported and worked on site, at least some of it from raw nodules. Gray obsidian was being imported largely as blades or as prepared blade cores. This seems to reflect a complex exchange system in which Arpachiyah had a key position. At least some of the green obsidian was being taken from the source to the site as raw or minimally prepared nodules, either by direct access to the sources or through an exchange network to which Arpachiyah had preferential access. The material was processed at Arpachiyah into blade or blade core form and dis- tributed to surrounding sites. Another site, or sites, must be postulated which was fulfilling the same role for gray obsidian-importing it, processing it, and trading it on. The system included multiple primary centers of importation and distribution. Arpachiyah seems to have participated both as a primary distri- bution center and as a recipient of blades from else- where in the system. Control of distribution of the green obsidian must have given Arpachiyah an im- portant position within an exchange network, both as an economic resource and, possibly, as control- ling the distribution of a status item. The presence of the gray obsidian, though, suggests that the direct economic importance was not necessarily critical. If it was cheaper in crude economic terms to obtain raw material, why also acquire manufactured blades made at another site? It is unlikely that exchange systems functioned on a purely economic basis in the Halaf. The nature of the commodity may have been important and its economic value relevant to some extent, but it may have been the act of ex- change itself that was most meaningful-a social rather than an economic transaction. It may be that the Burnt House acquired a significant proportion of its status as a setting for such exchanges by pro- viding a social and a ritual context. "Domestic" Objects Along with these more exceptional objects, there were a number of items ignored in the publication 6A more detailed study has been undertaken recently by Elizabeth Healey (Healey, in prep.) which confirms the general accuracy of this rough analysis.</page><page sequence="23">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 23 that are somewhat more domestic in nature, includ- ing spindle whorls and pierced sherds (A913; fig. 13:4-10). Some of the objects considered in the groups above, such as some of the plainer pottery and all but one of the stone axes, also probably ought to be considered here. These objects might perhaps be found in any Halaf building where material has been preserved in situ. Although they are of good quality, they are not exceptional, and several of them show signs of long use. It is unfortunately impossi- ble to know whether most of these objects came from the Long Room and Full Room, along with the high prestige objects, or from the other parts of the build- ing. Therefore, we do not know if they represent a domestic context that coexisted in a different part of the same building as the more exceptional elements or whether they were used alongside them. It does seem clear, however, that if the richer deposits in the Burnt House have any status, ritual, or cultic as- sociations, they had not yet been completely sepa- rated from a more domestic context. Furthermore, the status items may have been restricted to use at certain times and in specific social contexts. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING We should consider the destruction of the build- ing as distinct from its function. The burning of the Burnt House could be accounted for by accident, by hostile invaders, or by an attack from a rival central site, and it is difficult to discount these possibilities entirely. However, there are some indications of a more deliberate destruction. Some of the finest plates appear to have been deliberately smashed and scat- tered to the extent that pieces were found at oppo- site ends of the Long Room prior to the burning. Mallowan, assuming that the destruction was in war, suggests that this is the natural behavior of an in- vader (Mallowan and Rose 1935: 106). Yet there may be another explanation. If the quantity and ex- ceptional fineness of undamaged objects left in the building are an indication, there is little evidence of extensive looting or attempted recovery of the ob- jects. As considerable portions of the building were not extensively burnt, it seems unlikely that collapse of the roof in the unburnt areas was total or immedi- ate. Attempts could have been made to recover at least the less fragile objects, such as the stone bowls, the obsidian links, and the seals. It is not impossible, of course, that such an effort was made and that what we are left with is what escaped such a salvage operation. It seems more likely, however, that no such salvage took place. Therefore, we may be look- ing at a building in which there were large numbers of very valuable objects, some of which may have been deliberately destroyed before the building was burnt and which were left deliberately unrecovered following that fire. It is difficult to avoid at least a tentative conclusion that the end of the building was a ritual one. The destruction was followed by a significant gap in occupation. The subsequent build- ing on the site, TT5, seems much smaller and has a different building plan. Any ritual destruction would have marked the end of the role of the TT6 build- ing and the individual or institution it may have housed. It may also have been a key formal act in a conscious abandonment of the site. When comparanda are sought elsewhere in the Halaf culture, there are significant parallels on a much smaller scale in the Halaf levels of Yarim Tepe II. There are three characteristics of the destruction of the TT6 Burnt House that are significant here. * It is a collection of specifically the finest objects. * Some objects may well have been deliberately smashed. * Burning was involved. There are close similarities between these factors and the characteristics of other nonarchitectural de- posits known at Yarim Tepe II, where extremely fine objects (although not in as large concentrations as at the Burnt House) were smashed, deliberately ac- cording to the excavators, and associated with burn- ing (Campbell 1995b: 33). These deposits are often associated with human remains but not always-the presence of human remains seems optional rather than central to the ritual-so this is no barrier to this interpretation. Thus, an interpretation of the end of the Burnt House as a ritual destruction on a grand scale, somewhat similar to that suggested by Mun- chaev (Mallowan 1977: 96), would fit very closely to what we know of Halaf ritual practice. DISCUSSION It may be useful to summarize some of the con- clusions made above. The Burnt House succeeded previous complexes which may have had related functions, although without comparable sets of arti- facts from them it is difficult to consider them in more detail. While it is conceivable that some or all of the objects found in the Burnt House may have</page><page sequence="24">24 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 been brought to the building only at the very end of its life, it will be assumed in this discussion that they relate primarily to the use of the building. The objects in the building are overwhelmingly, but not entirely, high quality and probably high status. Evi- dence for formal social ritual, associated with con- sumption and probably taking place only on certain occasions, is suggested strongly by the polychrome plates. Cultic ritual is much more weakly indicated. There is evidence of large quantities of imported obsidian. Storage of material is further indicated by the sealings present. The large number of seals is probably significant, and there are hints that some degree of control over seals may have been exer- cised. Finally, the building was abandoned, arguably in an act of formal and deliberate destruction, and this area of the site was not reoccupied for a signifi- cant period of time. If the Burnt House was a workshop, as has com- monly been suggested, one would expect more evi- dence of manufacture-perhaps wasters, waste from the manufacture of the ground stone vessels, and so on. In particular, one might expect raw materials and partially completed objects to be present and less of a preponderance of finished, very high quality ob- jects. Only for flint and obsidian is there any compel- ling evidence for manufacture within the building. The only other potential raw material seems to have been a lump of red ocher that may or may not have been used for paint. We must reject the idea that it was a potter's workshop, although lithics manufac- ture does seem to be present. Instead, there was a collection of the finest ob- jects of their kind found at any Halaf site. This implies a great degree of control over the products of the best craftsmen by an individual or institution. It seems unlikely that the finest potter or potters and the finest stoneworkers, in various mediums, would all be local to the relatively small site of Arpachi- yah. Therefore, it is likely either that the products of fine craftsmen were gathered from a number of settlements or that the craftsmen themselves were persuaded to relocate to Arpachiyah because of eco- nomic or social reasons. Both cases suggest that Ar- pachiyah exercised influence over the highest quality, highest status material on a regional basis, although the size of the region is conjectural. The sealings support this. Standardized and orga- nized methods of marking property and controlling ownership, in whatever form, are only likely where significant numbers of people participate in the sys- tem, that is, when abstract symbols are needed to supplement personal knowledge. This implies con- siderable integration and control of society, probably over a significant geographical area. It also indicates the existence of spheres of control other than that of the Burnt House, among which sealings helped to regulate the movement of goods. This in turn implies subsidiary settlements from which sealed goods were transferred to the Burnt House (an es- sentially unilinear transfer of goods), and/or centers equivalent to Arpachiyah that exchanged goods (a bidirectional transfer of goods). If the earlier large tholoi in TT7 and TT8 shared some of the function as well as the plan of the Burnt House, these rela- tionships would have persisted over at least three building phases. This suggests an institutionalized control associated with either a series of individuals or a central institution that could sustain itself over a long period, perhaps in part through some forms of quasi-bureaucracy. It seems very likely that obsidian had a key posi- tion in the importance of the Burnt House. As an item only accessible through long-distance exchange mechanisms, it would have been ideally suited for manipulation by an elite institution in building and reinforcing a position of regional importance. There is additional support for Arpachiyah, although not necessarily the Burnt House, having a key role in the manufacture and distribution of artifacts. Davidson and McKerrell's neutron activation analysis of Halaf pottery from Tepe Gawra and Arpachiyah suggests that the former site received substantial quantities of pottery from Arpachiyah during the late Halaf, over a distance of some 25 km (Davidson and McKerrell 1980). It is entirely possible that other materials may have been involved but have not survived in the archaeological record. The critical importance of the distribution net- work that may have centered on Arpachiyah was probably not economic or even crudely political but social. It has been argued above that, with the ob- sidian, it may have been the act of exchange that was meaningful. Arpachiyah may have been able to center part of that exchange activity on the Burnt House owing to its preferential access to one or more particular sources, but it also participated in the exchange systems of obsidian from other sources. It also seems clear that exchange was embedded in a particular social context with secular and possibly sacred rituals providing a formal setting in which relationships could be negotiated and reconfirmed.</page><page sequence="25">2000 THE BURNT HOUSE AT ARPACHIYAH 25 Given the possible evidence for control over the seals which may have been used as part of a proto-bureau- cratic system associated with the Burnt House, it may be that the key role of the individual or institution within the Burnt House was as a mediator regulating exchange transactions. Given the traditional approaches to settlement hierarchy in the Near East, where size is equated to centrality, it is surprising that Arpachiyah is so small. It may have been at the center of a wide-rang- ing economic and probably political network, but it was a center that did not have a large concentration of population. It is equally interesting that there is not an obvious social hierarchy, supposedly the inevitable accompaniment of this degree of social complexity in a traditional chiefdom setting. The only clues to such a hierarchy are indirect. Certainly, there is a major concentration of wealth in the Burnt House, but we need not assume that it is associated with an individual rather than an institution. Simi- larly the wealth in some burials at Yarim Tepe, with the single possible exception of the outstanding burial on Yarim Tepe I (with the skull of a huge bull and about 200 astragalus bones along with pots and ground stone objects; Merpert and Munchaev 1971: 17), is probably not associated with the deceased in- dividual; rather it hints at an attempt to gain prestige by conspicuous consumption (Campbell 1995b). Fi- nally, the possible restriction of polychrome pottery to specific, high-status contexts suggests an attempt to symbolize power by specific stylistic devices. While all this does perhaps imply individual status, it is also compatible with power being concentrated in an institution. While it is difficult to apply the more traditional definitions of chiefdoms to this situation, Kristian- sen's proposals are possibly useful (Kristiansen 1991). He sees a new level of "decentralized, stratified so- ciety" as a vital jump from a tribe-based society on its way to a state. Chiefdoms are related to the tribal level, where kin is the vital means of linking people, rather than Kristiansen's proposed new level. "Decentralized, stratified society" is seen as hav- ing decentralized subsistence patterns, formalized ownership of land, and no towns. Instead there is specialized craft production, connected to elites, and control and taxation can play a significant economic role in development. Sahlins had previously high- lighted the importance of the shift from kinship to property as being a crucial development (Sahlins 1972: 92-94). It would be foolish to accept this as a new category into which late Halaf society in northern Iraq could be slotted without qualification, but Kristiansen's model is a surprisingly close fit and may be a useful starting point for future work. This model for Halaf society contrasts strongly with the picture emerging in southeast Turkey where Halaf sites such as Domuztepe (Campbell et al. 1999) and Kazane (Coursey, Bernbeck, and Pollock 1998) are now known to reach up to about 20 ha in size. There, large population centers seem to be de- monstrable, and there are strong arguments that they are acting as social and economic centers as well. It is certainly possible that there were similar large Halaf sites in northern Iraq-they may well be bur- ied under later urban tells such as Nineveh and Erbil-but we cannot, at present, point to any clear examples despite the very considerable amount of survey that has been carried out. Instead, our only good candidate for a central settlement is Arpachi- yah and it is undeniably small. It is too early to con- struct anything more than a suggestion, but it may be that there are two very different types of regional integration within the Halaf by the mid-fifth millen- nium. In north Syria and southeast Turkey there are major population centers at the center of the sys- tem while, perhaps, in northeast Syria and northern Iraq, regional stratification does not lead to popu- lation concentration. It is certainly possible that beneath the traditional regularity of the Halaf lurk radically different types of social complexity in dif- ferent regions. Undoubtedly, we will not understand the development of highly complex societies in Meso- potamia during the fifth and fourth millennia unless we gain a more sophisticated understanding of the social processes in the earlier part of that period when key prerequisites of state and urbanism may have been emerging. THE CATALOG OF OBJECTS IN TT6 The catalog of objects has been compiled from several sources. The basic record is taken from Mal- lowan's original small finds records (now in the Brit- ish Museum) and the list of the division of objects between Baghdad and Mallowan (kept in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad). Some additional facts are only given in the publication (Mallowan and Rose 1935). Where any information is recorded on the artifacts (usually in pencil), it has been taken as being more</page><page sequence="26">26 STUART CAMPBELL BASOR 318 accurate than the small finds record since it was prob- ably added in the field. The original scheme of small finds numbering has been retained: a capital A followed by a num- ber. Where Mallowan assigned a single number to a group of several objects, they have been designated with Mallowan's number, followed by a letter to pro- vide unique numbers; e.g., A913a to A913g. Where Mallowan did not allot a small finds number to an artifact, new numbers have been assigned starting at A1001. Wherever possible the Arpachiyah small finds have been located in museums, recorded in detail and, where necessary, redrawn. However, in cases where no museum is listed, the objects have not yet been traced. Also a considerable number of the ob- jects in the Iraq Museum were not available for examination or had been dispersed to regional mu- seums. In both these cases, Mallowan's original small finds record has been used as the primary source of details, supplemented by the publication of the site. In several cases also, in the Iraq Museum and in Iraqi provincial museums, an object could be seen in a display case but not examined in detail. This is intended to be a provisional summary cat- alog. When the remainder of the objects have been examined, it is hoped that a complete and compre- hensive catalog can be published. The location con- tains all the information in Mallowan's notes, even where the information is difficult to interpret. Illus- trations are only published with this article where the artifact has not been previously illustrated or where the original illustration is defective. Ideally this arti- cle should be read with the original report at hand. CATALOG Number Museum Illustration Location Description Polychrome Pottery A512 IM ?
