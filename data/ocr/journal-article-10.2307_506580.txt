One way that classical archaeology distinguishes itself as a division within archaeology is in its special focus on the artistic products of antiquity, to the point that classical ar- chaeology has nearly been a synonym for classical art his- tory. Conversely, artistic materials are too often secondary in other divisions within archaeology; a recent synthesis in the American "anthropological" school contrived to tell the archaeological story of ancient Arizona with no men- tion of the state's rich range of rock art beyond the "inta- glio" ground-drawings. Against that not uncommon atti- tude, the Palaeolithic cave art of Europe has a central place in human Pleistocene studies; that place began when its recognition as both very ancient and highly accom- plished so startled turn-of-the-century archaeological and aesthetic assumptions. With recent concern for the origins of language and of culturally modern human beings, the art now has that extra interest, however hard it may be to infer human behavior and human language skills unam- biguously from human imagery. The central puzzle is seen in these terms: modern Homo sapiens was spreading outside Africa long before rock art begins, so being a modern hu- man is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the mak- ing of art. But what then is the further prompt to initiate art, and did the prompt apply also to the Neanderthals, who seem largely to predate art in Europe? All this, if the flourishing of Upper Palaeolithic art actually is the start of art that matters. The present state of Palaeolithic and other rock-art studies, with their recent advances and upsets, may be of interest to the classical mainstream, as another area within our subject where art matters. The last decade has seen a remarkable transformation of Palaeolithic art studies, due to new discoveries, new ideas, and the implications of new dating work. The revolutionary discoveries have been the "three C's,"-the painted caves of Grotte Cosquer and Grotte Chauvet, and the open-air engraving sites of the C6a valley. Cosquer, discovered in 1991, is on the Mediterranean coast of southern France, a limestone cave accessible with the high modern sea level only through a deep and dangerous undersea entrance. Chauvet, discovered in 1994, is also a deep cave, in southeast France. Both have excellent and very well illustrated publications.' These two new caves can be ranked along with Altamira, discovered in 1879, Niaux, discovered in 1906, and Lascaux, discovered in 1940, if one makes a list of the "top five" sites. C6a is something odder still. Since 1981, engravings of distinctive Palaeo- lithic subject and style have been recognized at a small number of sites in Iberia in the full open air, rather than sheltered underground in deep caves or limestone rock shelters. The C6a sites, reported in 1994, and neighboring valleys in central Portugal present that same open-air phe- nomenon on a larger scale and over a wide area. The art may largely survive to us in the caverns, but it was clearly not an art only of the caverns. Less spectacular, but also im- portant to building the present-day corpus, have been the new discoveries from central and eastern Europe, and the better reporting of old discoveries there since the Iron Curtain fell away in 1989. Cosquer and Chauvet, even before the full program of systematic research there starts, have been key sites for dat- ing work also. There is sufficient carbon in a number of black paintings to make possible AMS radiocarbon dates directly on the pigments of the paintings themselves; and these can be supplemented by dates for carbon marks made by lighted torches brushed against the walls and for carbon fragments on the cave floors, which also show a hu- man presence. The dates are not numerous: Clottes re- ports 32 direct AMS analyses for 26 figures in nine caves;2 Davidson (table 1 of his essay in Beyond Art) reports 34 di- rect analyses for figures in six caves. There may not be many more: Clottes (in Beyond Art) dismayingly warns that already in Niaux, Cougnac, and Lascaux it is no longer pos- sible to find enough charcoal-about half a milligram-to 1 For Cosquer, see J. Clottes and J. Courtin, The Cave be- neath the Sea: Paleolithic Images at Cosquer (New York 1996); for Chauvet, see J.-M. Chauvet, E.B. Deschamps, and C.

So Paul Bahn may not be right when he says, in his foreword to the book on Chauvet, that "it is certain that over the next few years many more dates will be obtained for images in cave art which will help special- ists to fine-tune their knowledge"3 (see also Davidson in Be- yond Art). Clottes, as the officer responsible for all the French painted caves, is in a position to know. But those dates are sufficient to demolish existing schemes for cave art: very sophisticated and accomplished figures in Chau- vet are dated very early, so European cave art can no longer be fitted to the schema in which a crude and awk- ward beginning in rude Aurignacian images slowly im- proves with time to a high accomplishment in the Magdale- nian, as the glacial comes to an end. The new pattern of which the dates are a part further undermines, or now fully overturns, Andr6 Leroi-Gourhan's celebrated structuralist explanation for order in the art, defined by the classic op- posed pairs that structuralists have seen as the universal defining frames of human cognition.4 So we are in the deliciously uncomfortable position of having sufficient trustworthy newly reported dates to demolish established chronologies and their accompanying dogmas, but not of having sufficient dates in prospect by which we will neatly build a new and better chronology! Even many good dates would not tell us how to go about interpreting rock art; what they would offer is simply a reliable placing of the im- ages in time, an assistance or a prerequisite to the kind of study offered in Beyond Art. Discovery and dating interact in another way. Some new and experimental dating work at the C6a sites, where the open-air petroglyphs offer no charcoal for AMS analyses, has produced startlingly recent dates, a matter of a few hundred or a few thousand years, rather than the 12,000- plus years one would anticipate for fully Palaeolithic fig- ures. If that is the case, then the framework of "style" that has underlain so much study of Palaeolithic art (and of the materials for classical archaeology) may utterly fail, since it cannot there separate a figure made in the Pleistocene from one made even as late as the 18th century A.D.! Ei- ther those late dates are wrong; or the recognition of the C6a imagery as Palaeolithic by its distinctive traits is wrong; or that "Palaeolithic manner" of picture-making persisted or recurred into recent historical times. Broad and over- confident assertions were made about C6a and the most vigorous academic disputations were in full public gaze. (Rock-art studies, and as reflected in the leading special- ized publication Rock Art Research, seem sadly prone to abu- sive and personal exchanges as the medium of academic debate, so that wrangle rather followed a norm.) The surfaces bearing the figures were to have been flooded by a new hydroelectric dam on the C6a River; their status and future were central to a Portuguese na- tional election of which the archaeologically happy out- come was the cancellation of the already partly built C6a dam. I recently saw the fragments of rock art on the Co- lumbia Plateau that were "salvaged" by being blasted or chopped out of their rocky places when the Wonopum and Dalles dams were built on the Columbia River in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. They now sit forlornly, a little sheltered under the brute-concrete wall of the Dalles dam, but grubby with encrusted ash from the Mount St. Helens eruption of years past and spattered by the new season's bird-droppings. I ask myself when, by contrast with Portu- gal, these kind of cultural values have in the United States ever had a central impact on party politics, or when ar- chaeological conservation has effectively overridden the passion of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dam every free-flowing river in the nation, and thereby to destroy so much of the nation's river-valley archaeology? Paul G. Bahn's Journey through the Ice Age is a new edition of a 1988 book, with the late Jean Vertut its named coau- thor through his providing many of its good pictures. That first, inexpensive edition was not widely available. I wrote of that edition, as the cover of this one reports, "Paul Bahn has written a first-rate account of the most beguiling and intractable subject in prehistory, the Paleolithic art of the later Ice Age." I can say the same of the new edition, which has had a thorough and handsome make-over in recogni- tion of the transformation of its subject matter: this is not one of those editions in which the changes are only the es- sential corrections and updatings. In addition, the new publishers have made a more handsome book of it. Bahn's The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art is a new and world-ranging survey with matching pictures, excellent except for an attitude problem. A great many of the photographs are by the author, proving he has himself walked up the cruel long path to the high shelter at Game Pass in the South African Drakensberg, and by the Burling- ton Northern railroad tracks in the western United States, as well as down into the chilly and creepy caves of the French Pyrenees. The book being in a history series, Bahn starts with a narrative account of the discovery of prehis- toric art, and then makes a generous survey of varied im- ages, the world around. He has had the original idea of including a chapter on body art, as a reminder of the kind of larger graphic world in which prehistoric art was surely often a part, but of which we have no record. Bahn is a ubiquitous and influential commentator on rock art, as witness his two fine books reviewed here; so the reader needs also to know how pessimistic he is about the entire venture of archaeology. In other places5 Bahn has made clear his certain belief that no secure knowledge can be possible of prehistoric times: all archaeologists do is to invent stories about the past with which to amuse them- selves and through which to engage each other-many ar- chaeologists being of horrid character-in unkind dispu- tations. (He has the C6a affair to hand were he to seek a recent unpleasantness.) In this book, he divides his re- marks on interpretation between two chapters, one on the literal interpretations that are "matters of the body," and 3P. Bahn, "Foreword," in Chauvet et al. (supra n. 1) 7-12. 4A. Leroi-Gourhan, The Dawn of European Art (Cam- bridge 1982). 5 E.g., P. Bahn, Archaeology: A Very Short Introduction (Ox- ford 1996).</page><page sequence="3">1999] CURRENT ISSUES IN THE STUDY OF PALAEOLITHIC IMAGES 115 one on the symbolic that are "matters of the mind." Broadly, he likes the former, and dislikes the latter. Earlier this month I was in Wardaman country, now divided between the ranches of the north Australian cattle- raising business, in the company of its Aboriginal tradi- tional owners. Wardaman people have a confident knowl- edge of the pictures in the rock art of their country, how they came to be made, and what they stand for. These marks came about in one of three ways. There are pictures from the Dreaming, when the world was made as it is, when Plains Kangaroo jumped through the rock and thereby punched a hole through a vertical slab, when Py- thon wriggling through the hills thereby forced open a great and sinuous valley. There are pictures that old peo- ple made long ago. And there are pictures made by Warda- man people not such a great time past. This is a clear and potentially three-phase framework of chronology, but it does not neatly equate with what I start to recognize in the field as "early," "middle," and "late" in archaeological terms. When it comes to identifying their subjects, some of that knowledge matches what I guess as an outsider with- out Wardaman training: what looks to me like a kangaroo is a picture of a kangaroo; what looks like a fish with long, crocodilelike jaws is indeed a picture of a garfish. But not all: what I confidently see as an anthropomorph, by its head and eyes and its human-proportioned body and its arms and legs and its hands and feet and toes and fingers, may not in Wardaman understanding be a picture of a human being at all. Bahn's confidence that there are fairly secure "literal" interpretations (good research) and too risky "symbolic" interpretations (deceiving fantasies) fails in the reality of Wardaman country as Wardaman people know its structured imagery. With no grand chronology for cave art and no grand theory in place, what now is to be done in studying it? Beyond Art: Pleistocene Image and Symbol is a good set of 16 papers in that vein, reporting the issues and exploring the consequences; it is rather specialized for nonprehistorians. Randall White entitles his paper in terms of "materials" and "meaning," and reminds us he has loudly decried the use of the word "art" as a specialized category, appropriate to later stages of the Western tradition and therefore false for these ancient hunter-gatherer images. Better to call them "representations," in my view, a term that happily covers both the element of pictorial depiction and the broader concepts of symbolism.6 One could prefer "marks" over "representations," since not all art is representational of some subject; the same objection could apply to the word "pictures." Tellingly and pertinently, the Aboriginal languages of northern Australia, spoken by hunter-gatherer peoples with a strong tradition of what archaeologists call rock "art" and of body painting for ceremony, did not gen- erally have a word meaning exactly "art" in the modern Western sense.7 One is reminded here of the routine use in the classical literature of the term "vase" for painted pots of the antique era, although these objects only became "vases" centuries later when aesthetes of modern times chose so to call and to classify them: is it well judged or helpful or harmless or erroneous or catastrophically mis- leading to call those pots "vases" or those images "Pa- laeolithic art"? The classicists declare themselves by start- ing to extend the term "vase" to the earlier ceramic vessels of Greek prehistory, as one now begins to see,8 which come from societies having little in common with the aristocratic city-states. The prehistorians contributing to the collection under review announce their position in the words of their title, Beyond Art, and of their subtitle, Pleistocene Image and Symbol. On this issue, I think the prehistorians have the surer instinct. The volume has an introductory essay, four accounts of analytical methods, three inquiries into presences and ab- sences, three articles on regional patterns in imagery from the European Upper Palaeolithic, and five on interpreta- tion. Two of the four papers on analytical methods are good recent surveys by leading practitioners, Alan Watch- man on archaeometry (including absolute dating) and Jean Clottes on insights from new laboratory analyses. Since Watchman's paper was written, the collected dating results and methods of Ron Dorn have been questioned.9 His key work mostly concerns images on open-air surfaces; the C6a figures are also involved. That shock shakes the in- tegrity of the whole new field of absolute dating of rock art. Immediately put in question are studies claiming that the Olary rock engravings of south Australia are among the world's oldest dated art, and that some North American rock art even predates the Clovis horizon. The third paper is more of a regional study, in which Al- exander Marshack applies his established methods of mi- croscopic examination largely to Near Eastern materials, but without here justifying why the sets of marks he finds are indeed tallies and counts. He reports unusually shaped objects from the region, which may prove that there was depiction in the Middle Palaeolithic and before-so enor- mously predating modern humans. One of these is a peb- ble of volcanic tuff from Berekhat Ram, on the Golan Heights, which Marshack reads as humanly shaped into a 6 A similar usage is C. Peebles andJ.-C. Gardin eds., Rep- resentations in Archaeology (Bloomington, Ind. 1992). 7 In Kunwinjku, the main language of Arnhem Land where a strong painting tradition today perpetuates the iconography of the rock art, the word bim means "paint- ing," not the same as "art" (so, Kunwinjku Bim as title for an exhibition of contemporary Kunwinjku paintings: A. Brody, Kunwinjku Bim: Western Arnhem Land Paintings, Mel- bourne 1984). By extension, then, it has been used for other kinds of art, such as gunbirdi bim for the distinctive technique of making images in beeswax pressed onto rock surfaces (G. Chaloupka, journey in Time: The World's Longest Continuing Art Tradition [Chatswood 1993] 156-61). 8 H.A. Shapiro, C.A. Pic6n, and G.D.

Or is it a shaped pebble, which a sophisticated and stylish modern Homo sapiens sapiens con- trives so to interpret? I am not myself convinced that it is a representation of a human figure. In the fourth analytical paper, White offers two convinc- ing examples of one productive way forward, each a case- study of a class of small portable object; he looks with scru- pulous and detailed care at every aspect-the choice of raw materials; how that choice affects the form, tools, and techniques of transforming the form; distinctive attributes; wear; and the context of production, use, and disposal. If these material issues are the meaning, then here is an ac- count of meaning. Iain Davidson, beginning the papers on presences and absences, finds a congruence in the sequences from Eu- rope and Australia, the only zones with the shadow of a sound regional chronology. Language he is sure is late, and in each region he sees portable decorated objects as having preceded images on rocks. In each region, there- fore, a means of marking and identifying the individual (the small and portable objects) decisively precedes the markings in and of place (the images on fixed rock sur- faces); the two events will have been connected by a com- plex process in which the corporate identity of human groups was worked out and came to be identified with places. Ofer Bar-Yosef inquires why there is little art in the Le- vant before its vigorous start in the Natufian of some 12,000 years ago, so many centuries after plentiful produc- tion started in Europe. Looking to the social realm for an answer, he finds the major socioeconomic changes of the Natufian as plausibly signaling, for the first time in the re- gion, increased social stress and a need for identifying of various groups-the prompts to the emergence of habits of imagery. In an explanation from the other end of the larger European region, Manuel Gonzilez Morales pro- vides a matching account for the abrupt end of cave art in Spain, at broadly the same period. With the glacial ending, migratory animal species disappeared and subsistence de- pended more on gathering; human groups were less mo- bile. With less intergroup competition or fewer social ag- gregations, the waning scale of human social organization declares itself in a rapid disappearance of cave art and its animal imagery, shortly followed by a disappearance of fig- urative portable art. The first of the three regional studies is by Jean Clottes, another perceptive and well-informed essay, this on the dis- tinct differences between the "art of the light" (in or near the entrances) and the "art of the depths" (far inside the dark cave). Then Margherita Mussel and Daniela Zampetti review the Italian material, just enough in quantity to show pattern. Olga Soffer-whose energetic diplomacy has done so much to bring researchers from the two sides of the former Iron Curtain into productive contact-surveys the images from central and eastern Europe; she identifies five regional patterns in the appearance and proliferation of art and jewelry across Upper Palaeolithic Europe. The final section of five essays addresses the interpreta- tive process, not just the realities of prehistoric Europe, but the inescapable mirrors and lenses of our own culture through which we seek to discern it. Silvia Tomaskovd is good on how we view the classic sites of Dolni Vestonice/ Pavlov and Willendorf. Andr6e Rosenfeld is ever so good on "archaeological signatures" of the social contexts where rock art is produced, based on the varied ethnohistoric sources from Australia. That Australian material is, for bet- ter or worse, the main source of our not large range of di- rect insight for rock art in its social action;11 it is much more varied than the scanty South African referents that are presently influential. John Parkington and Anthony Manhire, in another first-rate essay, review and make de- ductions from paintings in the Western Cape of South Af- rica that depict processions and groups of human figures. David Lewis-Williams briefly presents the compelling case for interpreting some of the European Palaeolithic imag- ery as diagnostic of shamans' visionary experience. This in- telligent essay summarizes his new book, jointly written with Clottes, Les chamanes de la prehistoire.12 Unsurprisingly, this considered study-which like all original and forceful attempts to work with strong ideas may not be the whole truth-was immediately derided at great length by Bahn in the pages of Rock Art Research.'3 Finally, Meg Conkey closes a good and technical book with an essay in which context and interpretation are again central; the complaints of recent years as to how the ana- lyst's preconceptions shape what is seen are once more made, and tellingly illustrated once more with images from the years of literature in which men command, and women are largely absent. Some of these issues would be resolved if we tried always to keep separate the nature of the images then from the nature of the images now. It is entirely fair to place the bulls of Lascaux alongside the bulls of Picasso as masterpieces in depicting great crea- tures of symbolic importance, and that does no harm to our knowledge of either master who painted them; rather, it shows our respect for both. Trouble comes when we impose our common response on both masters as if to pretend that some matching of skill, technique, or visual impact must mean some common mentaliti or some com- mon experience-beyond a habit of painting bulls. The same goes for the other famous archaeological paintings of bulls, those in the Knossos palace frescoes. That one can 10 See a fuller publication with color photographs in A.

Much of this new work is slow, difficult, and painstaking, in large contrast to the confident grand sweep of the Abb6 Breuil's great study of half a century ago, Four Hundred Cen- turies of Cave Art (Montignac 1952), itself based on years of formidably diligent fieldwork. Palaeolithic cave art is yet another field within archaeology where the sketchy and patchy knowledge of first- and second-generation research both prompted and required strong and generalized ac- counts, whether explicitly theoretical or pushed forward by an unstated and robust "common sense." Then a painstaking accumulation of better factual knowledge, especially about fine-grained variability in space and time, both contradicts simple grand theory and makes for accounts that are more intricate, more local, more conditional-and less cleanly satisfying.
