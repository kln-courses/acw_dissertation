This work presents a twofold effort: to grapple with some prominent flaws embedded in the field of International Relations (IR) theory as well as an attempt to make use of those flaws as starting points to produce a foreign-policy approach, relevant to the developing countries in general and also explanatory ofthe recent changes undertaken by Argentina in this realm during the 1990s. Thus, the author implies that the significant changes that the Argentine foreign policy witnessed during Menem's presidency were grounded in such an approach. And there were plenty of changes: Argentina abandoned its systematic confrontational policy towards the US, signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, aborted the plans for the development of an intermediate-range guided missile?named the Condor II Project?etc. (pp. 1-5). Could any theoretical flaw lead to the development of a foreign policy approach? Escude examines a distinctive feature of the IR language, namely the anthropomorphic bias that pervades IR language when dealing with states as if they were a person, for example referring to states as being 'weak' or 'strong' actors who 'suffer', have 'pride' or are 'humiliated'.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 115 Though acknowledging that thinking without metaphors and analogies is almost impossible, such feature can also easily lead to fallacies: the state-as-person fiction diverts the attention from the individuals and the intermediate institutions to whose protection the state should be dedicated, under democratic assumptions, toward an anthropomorphic being, thus making the anthropomorphic fallacy (AF) (pp. 22-23). In this context, Escude highlights the risk of misunderstanding whose interest any given policy may be serving. Indeed, it is pointed out that before any given policy could be evaluated as making sense or being rational, the subject it is supposed to serve (citizenry, state, elite) must be explicitly enunciated (p. 11). Thus, the author argues in favour of developing a citizen-centric approach to IR instead of the state-centric one, for the latter being the mainstream of the field. Furthermore, the claim that the rationality of a policy depends on the subject served by it should not be considered as another way of saying that some states are subject to more domestic constraints than others, because such perspective implies that domestic demands for citizen welfare are simply undesirable limitations that are layed on the road of the state to power: for instance, to say that Australia, unlike North Korea, does not develop nuclear weapons because it is subject to domestic constraints (p. 11). Even though Escude acknowledges that it is empirically very difficult to distinguish between policies that are citizen-centric from those that are only state-centric, elite-centric or govern- ment-centric in terms ofthe interests that they serve?a kind of distinction that has been usually neglected in the IR field?this disadvantage should not hinder any efforts in this way, given that such difficulty adds to our understanding, while ignoring the conceptual difference between a citizen-centric policy and its alternatives hopelessly confuses the issues under study (p. 14). Two groups of operational definitions established by the author should be helpful to this matter, definitions that encompass concepts like nation, state, national interest, interests of the state, interests of a government, interests of a statesman (pp. 14-15) and central states, peripheral states and Third World states (pp. 18-19). Yet the very usefulness that these?or any?definitions may play in terms of identifying who are the main beneficiaries of any given policy, leads to an important claim stated by the author: philosophical assumptions are necessarily built into the very logic of IR theory. Given the presence of the AF, ailegedly value-free IR theory may unintentionally help to legitimise totalitarian regimes and their elite-serving foreign policies (p. 46). Within this tight context, Escude chooses the citizen-serving policies: if economic growth is acknowledged as the primary interest of a peripheral country, then any factor associated with foreign policy that results in an obstacle to such interest is to be avoided, and any foreign policy that facilitates growth or development is to be deemed advisable (p. 96). Nonetheless, Escude goes on enhancing the significance of this perspective, arguing that economic development may prove to be useful either for the material welfare of the citizenry or for the accumulation of state power through the mercantilistic link between wealth and power (p. 132). Mainstream concepts from the field of IR are rigorously examined, almost always stressing shades of meaning?though sometimes these are not slight at all. The analogy between the market and the international system and the importance of systemic variables to account for different results in the behaviour of the units (pp. 48-53), interest defined in terms of power followed by its complementary concept that sets politics as an autonomous sphere of action disengaged from other spheres (pp. 53-58), the alleged anarchic structure of world politics (pp. 58-68) among others, all of them contributing to develop an alternative foreign policy approach, named peripheral realism. The points that these concepts seem to miss are the hierarchical link between wealth and power (p. 57), that the structure of the interstate system is better described by hierarchy rather than anarchy?a distinction particularly meaningful as far as the sanction linkages are concerned (pp. 62-64)?thus acknowledging functional differences between states that in turn stern from their different capabilities (p. 64). Regarding the changes recently undertaken by Argentina, this work is much broader in scope but for a brief paragraphs dedicated to particular episodes, mainly in an anecdotal tone. Could all these concepts be deemed as a foreign-policy approach? Escude states that peri? pheral realism is more a foreign-policy philosophy than a positivist social science, and it avoids lapsing into mere ideology because its values and philosophical assumptions are explicit (p. 132).</page><page sequence="3">116 Book Reviews Indeed, the author shares the perspective that IR theories should be seen more as aspects of contemporary world politics than as explanations of contemporary world politics. Hence, his theory sets up a reorientation of the Kantian question of 'What can I know?' to the Foucaldian question of 'How have my questions been produced?' (p. 130).
