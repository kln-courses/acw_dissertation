<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FATES, THE GODS, AND THE FREEDOM OF MAN'S WILL IN THE AENVEID. FATES OF PARTICULAR PERSONS OR COMMUNITIES. VERGIL has a strong idea of personal fate. A certain fate becomes attached to a certain person (or community) and follows him all his life; then the fates are spoken of as the fates of that person. As a parallel one might quote the idea in Maeterlinck's essay 'La Chance' (in the volume, Le Temple enseveli, 1902, pp. 22zz9 sqq.). For both Maeterlinck and Vergil men are marked out, one might almost call it annexed, by good or bad fortune; yet both authors refuse to endow this good or bad fortune with personality: they deal with personal fates which yet lack personality. This is at once to introduce an inherent contradiction. 'Fate,' if we are to attach any real philosophical content to the word, must mean something bigger than what happens to one person. The world of persons is full of contradictions, rivalries and jars, and the poet (philosopher) looks for a harmonizing or ordering principle: let men struggle in the grip of the dis- ordered and disjointed earthly sphere, yet ' fate' at least should partake of that which harmonizes or orders. But if fate is attached to particularities and persons, it enters into their limitations and pettinesses; it becomes drawn into the conflict, instead of directing the conflict. A 'personal fate' implies the limitation of the infinite by the finite, and verges on being a contradiction in terms, simply because one personal fate will contradict another personal fate. But how can fate, if it means that which is 'ordered,' be self-contradictory ? Ancient thought failed to grapple with the difficulty. Vergil is here entirely the interpreter of his age.1 He has an excuse, which Maeterlinck cannot claim, of being confused on a subject where his contemporaries and predecessors were confused. He accepts without misgiving the widespread ancient idea of a personal fate attached to this man or to that, with all its inherent difficulties. Thus we hear of the fates of Priam (II. 554), of Deiphobus (VI. 511), of Lavinia (VII. 79), of Turnus (X. 472), of Latinus (XI. 160), of Aeneas' descendents (VI. 683, VIII. 731). We hear also of the fates of a community, Troy (II. 34, III. 182). And more than anything else there dominates the poem the idea of the fates of Aeneas (I. 382, II. 294, VI. 66, VII. 234, where Ilioneus swears 'by the fates of Aeneas '). The fates, then can be closely attached to particular persons. 1 Warde Fowler, Roman Ideas of Deity, p. 6r sqq.</page><page sequence="2">12 L. E. MATTHAEI Vergil further admits the conflict of fate with fate. One person's fate may be 'better' than another's (VI. 546); or fates may be positively opposed to fates; in VII. 294 Juno speaks of the fates of the Trojans as contrary to her own fates, Heu stirpem inuisam et fatis contraria nostris fata Phrygum. In VII. 224 the world is driven forward to a disaster because of the awful clash between the rival fates of Asia (Troy) and Europe (Greece). In IX. 133 Turnus boasts that 'the fate-inspired answers of the gods' (which have promised Italy to the Trojans) do not terrify him: for he too 'has his own fates': 'sunt et mea contra Fata mihi.' And clearer than all else Jupiter weighs in the scale the 'opposing' fates, 'fata diuersa,' of Aeneas and Turnus just before the final struggle (XII. 725-8). It is very much the same line of thought when a person's fate is said to change; he then has 'new' fates, or 'different' fates. This again involves an absurdity, if we put the contents of our English word 'fate' into the Vergilian ' fata': the English 'fate' presupposes not only what is orderly, but what is fixed beforehand, an irrevocable destiny; but how can what has been fixed be altered, unless the whole universe is to fall to pieces ? What is destined must be, and nothing can alter it. Hence to talk of 'new' and 'old' fates is mean- ingless. Yet Vergil gives us the following: Venus asks Jupiter how it can be allowable for anyone to make new fates for the Trojans: 'noua condere fata' (X. 35) ; Aeneas, in a striking passage, cries that he is being called out of one set of fates into another: 'nos alia ex aliis in fata uocamur' (III. 494), words which taken in their context1 mean that the old glories of Troy are passed away, now begins a new era. And there is very much the same idea in I. 239, when Venus tells Jupiter how she consoles herself for the present misery of Aeneas with the thought of the 'contrary' fates, which would come to him later, hoc equidem occasum Troiae tristesque ruinas solabar fatis contraria fata rependens. Again, Latinus, in despair, says 'by living he has worsted his own fate' (XI. 160), a very odd expression; he means that fate intended him to be happy, but that he has lived too long and seen his happiness turned into grief by the death of his son; here there is very dimly expressed a contrast between what life is and what it should be, and 'fate' is made to stand for what it should be, its best possibilities. In an almost exactly opposite sense, Tarchon and the Lydians are said to have ' freed themselves from their fate'; they were doomed to misfortune unless they could find a foreign leader, of whom there seemed no hope; but they did find one (Aeneas), and so were set free (X. 154). These two examples put over against each other are surely very instructive. In the first, fate is what life ought to be contrasted with what life is; in the 1 They occur in his farewell to Andromache.</page><page sequence="3">THE FATES, ETC., IN THE AENEID 13 second, fate is what life is contrasted with what it ought to be. How can any stable notion be rescued from such a contradiction ? To me the whole gist of the Vergilian problem of the fates lies in this contradiction. I believe that Vergil inherited a gloomy and pessimistic definition of fate, as of a malignant pursuer of men, a power to be feared and placated, but without moral inspiration or elevation of any kind. We know that the third and second centuries B.C. worshipped such a goddess; her favour was almost as disturbing as her disfavour: it was so capricious, so erratic, a man were best without the sudden and treacherous smiles of Fortune. Fortune became identified with pure Chance in the nervous thought which followed the post-Alexandrine political upheavals. But the Romans had always struggled against this miserable doctrine, and foremost among them is Vergil. He is constantly pouring a mass of moral aspirations into his 'fata,' constantly making them orderly and beneficent, instead of disorderly and malignant. But he does not entirely get rid of the old ideas; he is always swaying between the thought of a moral world, and the thought of a sad world, of a world, indeed, which is unjust. So much in preliminary explanation of what I believe to be the funda- mental attitude of Vergil. Meanwhile we may agree that the first impression which we get of the fates in Vergil is of something disorderly and unfixed, especially if we dwell on these passages about personal and contradictory fates. There is indeed a remedy conceivable amid this confusion. It is to fix one's eyes on the only permanent spiritual force we know, the mind of man. Such is the bold, self-confident view of life. But the Vergilian religion is worlds away from this. It cannot seek refuge from the great confusion in the mind of man. Confused that greater struggle of fate and fate may be, never- theless it utterly dwarfs the human struggle. There is-a distinct sense of hopelessness about the human struggle, if at any moment a man, who by his native wits or strength or virtue has overcome another, may be toppled over, because in some other sphere his 'fate' has given way before his rival's 'fate.' And the laws on which one fate fights another fate in some remoter sphere are utterly obscure. Here is the very root of pessimism, and pessimistic the A eneid most certainly is. And from this intolerable situation rises an indignation: it is not for nothing that the Aeneid ends with the spirit of Turnus fleeing 'indignant' to the shades (XII. 952); it was made to leave the warm body because the 'fate' of Turnus had been lighter in the scale than that of Aeneas (XII. 725-8), a verdict overruling all qualities of skill, strength, courage or virtue which Turnus might possess. Thus does the sphere of greater things, of fate, make mockery of humble human effort. And now, instead of being in a world where the spirit of man is dominant, we seem to be in a world of uncertainty. Here the minds of men diverge: the one type, as I have already said, enthrones mere irrational Chance as ruler of all things, the other enthrones a God of Mystery; this type of mind, to put it</page><page sequence="4">14 L.E. MATTHAEI rather crudely, credits the ruling Power with the benefit of the doubt. The ruling laws are indeed inscrutable: still they zmay be good. Thus out of pessimism is born a kind of saving optimism. Vergil is the very master of those who combine with a profound sense of misery a still profounder, though almost inarticulate, hope; the Vergilian attitude is throughout a waiting upon God. And so with all the somewhat mechanical conflicts of fates and deities which rove obscurely across the Aieneid, he manages to leave room enough- though only just enough-for the factor of choice or will. He is far from clear, because he is one of those sympathetic hearts who see 'the other side of every forceful triumph '1; but it is remarkable how, without ever endowing the fates with personality, he is always verging on endowing them with the capacity for moral choice. Here he widely diverges from our conception of fate as a mere fixity, our conception being infinitely more mechanical than his. The striking thing throughout the Aeneid is that the fates of Aeneas and the Trojans so often lose their partial personal aspect and are widened into a conception of the fate of the whole world: Aeneas carries with him the welfare of humanity. A list of passages is I. 2, III. 396, IV. 225, 340, 355, V. 656, 703, VI. 147, VII. 120o, VIII. 12, 512, IX. 643, X. 67, XI. 112, XII. III, 795. This means that something decisive in the sphere of fate has decided for Aeneas and the remnant of Troy. The corresponding idea is that it has decided against his enemies; for which see XII. 676. In fact, two inferences are constantly being suggested to us by Vergil, (I) that with Aeneas is bound up the future of the world, (2) that the fates take sides with Aeneas, because they care about this. It is difficult to avoid language more definite and personal than Vergil ever uses; I should call these two ideas presuppositions to the poem, rather than a part of its stated philosophy. But if the fates eventually do take sides, if they are for Aeneas and Rome and against Carthage, then they have exercised a moral choice and are a moral force. THE RELATION OF THE GODS TO THE FATES. Perhaps Vergil would not have been able to keep his fates clear of the difficult notions of personality, had he not reserved another sphere for portray- ing superhuman personality-the gods. The Vergilian gods were for Vergil a convenient dumping-ground for all those degrading notions of anthropomorphic weakness, from which he was struggling to free his conception of the ruling power in things. The system of the Olympian gods intrudes hopelessly on the mystic Vergilian Stoico-Epicurean philosophy, and makes-there is no denying it-one glorious muddle. In the struggle between the gods and the fates in the Aeneid the following points are noteworthy. The battle between them threatens at moments to become serious, yet it 1 Professor Conway, Proc. of Classical Association, I9o6, p. 30.</page><page sequence="5">THE FATES, ETC., IN THE AENEID 15 never really determines the action of the epic; whereas the relations between the fates and man, though far less explicitly treated, are intrinsically of much greater importance. The intervention of the gods springs from their wishes or determination, conflicting with, and disturbing the operations of fate. Here the influence of epic tradition1 is obvious; nor does Vergil scruple to attribute trivial, or at least, slight reasons for this state of affairs: he has no picture of two great world-powers or influences over against each other involved in far-reaching conflict and profound disorder. Juno hates the Trojans merely because Paris had given the verdict of beauty against her and because Ganymede was caught up from Troy to be Jove's darling, finally because Dardanus, the ancestor of Troy, was a son of Jupiter by her rival, Electra (I. 25-7). Juturna helps Turnus to defy the fates for the simple and natural reason that she is his sister; but it cannot be said that this is a cause of importance which should induce a world-conflict.2 The opposition between gods and fates is conducted as follows. Juno and Venus both at times profess not to know the fates. Thus Juno is uncertain whether the fates will allow Carthage to be the mistress of the world; she has heard rumours that the imperial destiny is for another people, the Romans (I. 18-22); Venus can profess a similar ignorance (IV. 9og, IIo), and Jupiter can offer 'to unroll the secrets of the fates' in order that she may be better informed (I. 261-2). It is natural, of course, that fate should be hidden to man, except when revealed by special means, e.g. prophecy (cf. VII: 123 etc., VIII. 499, X. 5o01); but this ignorance displayed by gods of the first rank can only lead us to infer an inferiority of the gods to the fates: perhaps even Jupiter does not know the fates, until he unrolls them. Then, when Juno explicitly puts herself into opposition against the fates, the scope of this opposition is limited. It is a power of delay'3; she cannot reverse the decrees of the fates, but she can put important obstacles in their path: non dabitur regnis, esto, prohibere Latinis (sc. Aenean) atque immota manet fatis Lauinia coniunx: at trahere atque moras tantis licet addere rebus, at licet amborum populos exscindere regum. (VII. 313-6) As she herself very well says, she can 'drag things out.' Now the idea of delaying fate springs from this very ignorance which we have noted, from the uncertainty in the mind of a god whether a particular ordinance is of the inviolable and permanent decrees of fate or only a temporary and passing phenomenon. The power of delay is the ignorant 1 Glover, Vergil2, p. 293; but Mr. Glover's views on the gods of Vergil are somewhat different from those here expressed. 2 For the trivial behaviour of the gods in general, see MacInnes' paper on ' The Con- ception of Fata in the Aeneid,' Class. Rev., 19Io, p. 169. 3 Such as Poseidon has in the Odyssey, see Od. V. 288-90.</page><page sequence="6">16 L. E. MATTHAEI opposition of an inferior to a superior and cannot last, if challenged; and indeed Turnus tells his goddess sister, Juturna, to cease from delaying the fates any longer, for it is useless (XII. 676, and cf. XI. 587). And even this power of delay is by a kind of permission fromi the fates, for Juno defines her protection of the Latins to have been for 'as long as Fortune and the Parcae allowed success to be with Latium'(XII. 147, 8), and when Jupiter tells her that her opposition must cease (XII. 806), she knows she must submit, and only asks that the hated name of Troy may vanish, and the Latin name be adopted by the Trojans instead: this is 'not forbidden by any law of fate' (XII. 819). Indeed, according to Vulcan, the fates (and Jupiter) would not have forbidden Venus to delay the fall of Troy by yet another ten years, had she chosen to exercise her powers (VIII. 396-9). Thus there is a kind of permitted opposition to the fates from the gods. Jupiter, however, is in a position apart. The passage in book XII., where Jupiter persuades Juno no longer to contend against the fates, might lead us to the belief that Jupiter is the supreme arbitrator between the fates and Juno. But the quarrel in Olympus at the beginning of book X. will dispel that illusion. In the contest between Juno and Venus (Latins and Trojans) Jupiter refuses to side with either: 'rex Iuppiter omnibus idem' (X. 112); 'but the fates will find a way': 'fata uiam inuenient' (1. 113). The whole passage is one of the most unsatisfactory in the Aeneid. Jupiter seems to work neither with the fates nor against them, neither to be more powerful than they nor definitely to range himself with them, and dramatically his position is extra- ordinarily weak, for he called the council for the express purpose of settling the quarrel (1. I sqq.); but as the quarrel remains entirely unsettled, the whole episode is otiose, for it has no effect on the action. The fact is that all the opposition between the deities and the fates is very much a part of the 'epic machinery.' The much deeper and profounder instincts of the poem are to set not an opposition, but a harmony, between fate and god. Vergil is careful never to set Jupiter himself in opposition to the fates; the passage in book X. is his most equivocal utterance, and even here the most we miss is the active cooperation of Jupiter with the fates; no concealed undercurrent of divergence is indicated. Jupiter refuses to side with wife against daughter, or with daughter against wife: he can afford to refuse, he can allow himself the pleasure of being finely impartial, for the decision in any case does not rest in his hands, but the higher power of fate will deal with it: 'the fates will find a way.' Or we may go a little further and postulate a still greater degree of accord between Jupiter and the fates by saying1 that Jupiter knows it better that the goddesses should learn by experience rather than be merely quelled by a manifestation of the power of the fates acting through him. Again, it is Jupiter who explains to Cybele that she cannot have powers which contravene the fates. She had come to him with a request that the ships of Aeneas, which he had hewn from her pines growing in her sacred 1 Heinze, Vergil's EPische Technik, I9o3, p. 290, n. 2.</page><page sequence="7">THE FATES, ETC., IN THE AENEID 17 groves-gladly had she given them-that these ships might magically be preserved from all disaster by land and water. But Jupiter says that Aeneas is mortal man and must not count on magic powers, and that no god must help him to run counter to the fates by equipping him with magic ships (IX. 94-7). But he will do what he can; when the fates bring round the hour of destruction for the ships, he will let them be changed into sea-nymphs and disappear: so no undue and unauthorized help will be given to Aeneas contrary to the will of the fates, and yet Cybele's feelings need not be outraged by the destruction of her sacred timber (1. 77-121). Indeed, throughout the fates are so intrinsically powerful, that Jupiter can afford to suggest and to obtain from them, as it were, little concessions and acts of grace, which will make no difference in the end, but which will spare the feelings of the various goddesses. So Juno is allowed to snatch Turnus away from the battle at a deadly moment by fashioning a false image of Aeneas (X. 633 sqq.) and once the fates are actually spoken of as the fates of 'unjust Juno' (VIII. 292). Sometimes the gods are overtimid at taking these concessions (IX. 6); sometimes, on the other hand, they persist in building vain hopes on them; there is a pretty passage in which Jupiter warns Juno in the kindest manner that she must not read more into his words than is there, but she insists in hoping against her better sense that he does not mean what he says (X. 628). If she were not so dignified and stately in all her anger, she would be very like a spoilt child, to whom one must allow a certain license and certain time in which to recover, and in whose case one can afford to do so, because of the plenitude of one's own power. It is fate that dominates everywhere, and every other power is a mere instrument to minister to its decrees. Often, of course, the fates (or fate) are mentioned alone (III. 337,-VI. 466, 713, VII. 255, 272, 594); sometimes the gods, in their turn, are mentioned alone, vaguely as a body, but then the fates are never far away; e.g. in the famous passage where the gods are seen by Aeneas in awful displeasure leaving the wrecked city of Troy (II. 601-23, especially 11. 602 and 622); but it is really the fates who doom the city, the fates acting through the gods (VIII. 398). Then there are the many passages where gods and fates are coupled (e.g. III. 717, VII. 50, 239, 584), and clearly they work together. Apollo has a special position; because of his gift of prophecy, he communicates them to men and is thus their mouthpiece (II. 121, III. 395); but for the most part Jupiter is their best, one is tempted to say their most convenient, instrument; therefore we hear about the' fata louis,' because they work through him as a channel (I. 262-297 sqq., IV. 614). And in this he may be either merely mechanically transmissive, or he may be a true intermediary, more often conceived as the latter, I think: sic fata deum rex sortitur uoluitque uices, is uertitur ordo (III. 375). He too, therefore, can be called 'omnipotent,' because he shares in their B</page><page sequence="8">18 L.E. MATTHAEI omnipotence (II. 689, IV. 220, VIII. 398).1 But very often we get language of the greatest vagueness: 'fata deum, fata deusque' or 'fata' and 'numina' together (III. 717, VI. 376, VIII. 512, 575), or such combinations as 'fata,' 'deus' and 'fortuna' (XII. 676-7). Not even in the lines (XII. 725-8) where Zeus is seen weighing the fates of Aeneas and Turnus must he be looked on as the superior of the fates. The pas- sage is a manifest imitation of Iliad XXII. zog sqq. and too much stress there- fore need not be laid on it; in it lies rather the imitation of the artist than the originality of the thinker. Yet it does fit into the general scheme, for the weigher is only the agent, after all; it is not he who can determine on which side the scales shall sink. It is the weights inside the scales, the fates of Aeneas and Turnus, which make them to sink or to rise: he who holds the scales is only an agent, a pivot, powerless in himself, a mere instrument.2 There is one other point to notice about the fates, an important one. I have spoken of them as endowed with a power of choice: they are not mechanical: but neither are they capricious. On the intellectual and moral side they work through the gods; on the physical side they work through n:ature, and nature is a system, not a chaos. That is why they set their decree against magic (see supra pp. 16, 17) and why in the Aeneid we have none of those extraordinary pictures to which Vergil treats us in the Eclogues of yellow and purple sheep (Ecl. IV. 42). Such would be incompatible with his incomparably loftier conception of the course of nature in the Aeneid. The fates are an 'order,' to which is subordinated all things on earth and in heaven, the feeble- ness of man and the anger of mighty gods: such anger is the lever which they use for their great ends: haec responsa dabat, uel quae portenderet ira magna deum, uel quae fatorum posceret ordo. (V. 706) This more magnificent Stoic conception of the fates as the rule of order, immanent also in the physical phenomena of nature (in IV. 519 the stars are 'conscious' of fate), may be called the major conception of the Aeneid; it reconciles the conflict of the gods, and it must in some way reconcile the separate conflicting personal fates of an Aeneas and a Turnus: but into that Vergil does not deeply probe. Indeed he never entirely loses himself in the remote Stoic abstraction of the etLappv27; perhaps it would have been better if he had; but the Homeric tradition lay too heavy on him. Against the back- ground of his fates his gods have no power: yet he trifles with the thought that they have. He could have left to them, even without power, dignity and worth: his genius was peculiarly fitted to have given us a series of beautiful figures like Milton's Archangels: but he is distracted by the ancient demand t 'Omuipotens' of Juno, but only in the eyes of Allecto (VII. 428), of Apollo, in the eyes of Arrtins (XI. 790o, cf. 'summe deum' in 785). Here Juno and Apollo replace Jupiter to their own particular proteges.

THE POSITION OF MAN. 'Fortuna omnipotens et ineluctabile fatum:' 'all-powerful Fortune and unavoidable Destiny' (VIII. 334), one of the finest rhythmic lines in the Aeneid, and certainly one most typical of its thought. Fate, though perhaps not per se predestined, is inevitable for men and uncontrollable by them: this is a thought that haunts the Aeneid; Vergil is always fighting against it, and always slip- ping into it; once at least he arrives at the extreme logical position of the uselessness of prayer (VI. 376). And Aeneas has always been reproached by his critics for his ultra-patient nature. The reproach is a merited one: a little of the sacred fire of rebellion would have carried hiin to our heart of hearts. It is clear that almost always he is unable to resist his own fates. This appears in the description of the last scenes of Troy. There he would infinitely rather have died with his fellows in the horrors of those last hours; but the fates intervened; they had reserved him for other uses, and therefore rush as he might into the malke, all weapons were harmless against him: testor . . . nec tela nec ullas uitauisse uices Danaum, et si fata fuissent ut caderem, meruisse manu, (II. 432-4). The same in IV. 340; in fact, he is the victim, as well as the nursling, of his fates. Once only does the compulsion take an obvious or open form, when fates and gods 'stop up the man's pitiful ears' from listening to the pleadings of Anna (IV. 440).1 As a rule, the compelling force is more insidiously suggested, glossed over, or disguised; but it is there at all times, and the general effect is that Aeneas can never lift himself out of what we may justly call the degrading atmosphere of compulsion. Perhaps this is an overstatement : he could resist. He did resist when he rushed into the murderous fray of Greeks to seek his death. He was not pre- vented from this, but the weapons themselves were turned away from him; on them, inanimate things, the compulsion was exercised, and thereby the man's action not forbidden, but frustrated. It is a nice point, but not unimportant, and it is to be noticed that Aeneas once very distinctly says that he could resist his destiny, if he chose; he could 'forget his fates and stay in the land of Sicily' (V. 700-703). He has the power to disobey.2 But he does not exercise the power. He does not exercise it, because he does not choose to exercise it. In the eyes of Aeneas it is not so mnuch im- possible, as wrong, to resist his fates. This is clear in his answer to Dido's 1 Rather like the hardening of Pharaoh's heart in the Bible. SThe same results, with other arguments and examples, in MacInnes, op. cit., p. 173.</page><page sequence="10">20 L. E. MATTHAEI long reproach, the only argument that gives his pleas any dignity at all. The wrong done would be in the first place to his own son, Ascanius, 'whom even now I am spoiling of his kingdom in thb West and the lands allotted to him by the fates' (IV. 355). But that v-'uld be only a small symptom of the great wrong done by him to other; to the future above all; and therefore it is just and right that a god of ,yarning should stand in flaming light to drive him along the path to Paly: the path to Italy is the path of duty; 'not of mine own desire do I seek Italy': 'Italiam non sponte sequor'(IV. 361); and yet it is of his own desire. He hates the 'horrida belli fata,' but-he follows them. A definition of this attitude of the voluntary spirit acting within the circle of compulsion, of obedience completing and perfecting, making valid, the dictates of fate, is given by Nautes in Sicily in his advice to Aeneas; at this point the action has paused, before the second great half of the poem is inaugurated by the descent into Hades: nate dea, quo fata trahunt retrahuntque sequamur; quidquid erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est (V. 709).1 Fate is to be 'conquered' by obedience. An instructive case is that of Latinus. He desires to co-operate with the fates, but has not the strength of will to do so against the wishes of his people, who are tempted by Juno. He knows that war against Aeneas is wrong, 'infandum contra fata deum' (VII. 583); yet he gives his consent to it. And at the moment of his yielding he cries out that he 'is being broken by the fates': 'frangimur heu fatis' (VII. 594). Thus do the fates instantaneously destroy those who dare to cross their path. They require an obedience which may involve an almost supreme effort, so tremendous are their demands; and where obedience is not freely given, it may be obtained by force. Nevertheless, they do not demand an automatic, mechanical obedience, but reasoned and deliberate action. They never once demand what is morally wrong, and they do not destroy needlessly or without excuse. I do not know whether Vergil, if pressed, could have been got to subscribe to the Jewish doctrine that all suffering was the result of some human defect; the instinct of his nature would have been against so hard a faith. But he does take some trouble to show how certain notorious cases of apparently unmerited suffering were due to no heartless decree from above: the will of man had also been involved in bringing them about. Laocoin would have saved Troy by persuading the Trojans to open the Wooden Horse 'had not the fates of the gods, had not our minds been astray' (II. 54, cf. 1. 34). This I conceive to mean not an alternative, but a cooperation: both 'the fates of the gods' wished evil to Troy, and also the minds of the Trojans 'were astray.' Without the sin2 of the Trojans the gods could not have destroyed Troy, just as without r Noticed by Warde Fowler, Roman Ideas of Deity, p. 77; and cf. Aen. VIII. 131. s For an analysis of the 'sin' of the Trojans, see Professor Conway, op. cit., p. 32. He defines it as the selfishness and cowardice of leaving Laocoon to his fate.</page><page sequence="11">THE FATES, ETC., IN THE AENEID 21 the obedience of Aeneas they could not have made Rome. Note that here the fates are credited with evil intent. This may have been in pursuance of some vaster, greater moral end, some final salvation of the world. Vergil never says so, and I am inclined to believe that in this a part of the story the old idea of fate as an evil, malignant pursuer is fairly prominent, and only modified insofar as man is shown to have at least contributed to the causes of disaster. This part of the story is one which Vergil would be the least able to alter. At the same time, we must suppose that to Vergil's mind the fates would have dealt with an innocent Troy innocently. The fact remains that the mind of Troy was 'astray.' I A similar explanation applies to the plaint of Deiphobus: 'My fates, and the dreadful crime of the Spartan woman over- whelmed me in this ruin' (VI. 511), which also assumes the guilty human will (of Helen) to have cooperated with fate. So too, in more general terms, the mind of a reckless man is defined as doomed to ruin, because ignorant of his future lot, but also because it cannot keep free of arrogance brought by prosperity (X. 501); ignorance by itself would surely have been innocent. In the case of Deiphobus it becomes apparent that the guilt of one person may involve the ruin of another; this goes far to throw out the working of the law, and to explain the tragic misadjustment of the world as it exists. But even making all allowances for this, we have a haunting feeling that we are not at the bottom of things yet. Brought to book on the question of Troy, pausing at the crucial moment, the entry of the Wooden Horse, Vergil deliberately gives us an Aeschylean faith which asserts the moral governing of the world and the allotted place of suffering in that moral scheme, though he does not specifically accept the Aeschylean idea of the educative value of suffering; suffering, in the case of Troy, was merely punishment, disproportionate punishment; it could not educate the Trojans, for it destroyed them. When- ever Vergil speaks of the fates, he has this moral government of the world in his mind. But (in this case very noticeably) he is much more apt to sympathize with the victim, than to justify the law. I believe heis at bottom inconsistent, and that his logic and his instinct cross each other and pull him different ways. And supposing Troy had remained innocent, what then ? This would be a very hard nut for the Vergilian philosophy to crack. We cannot help seeing that it was extremely convenient for the gods (who had made up their minds to destroy the city), that the Trojans should have been 'astray.' Supposing a Troy innocent ad infinitum? I have postulated that in that case the gods would have to respect its innocence; but I think the immediate answer of Vergil would be that there never is a Troy innocent ad infinitum. Always at some point, the will of man takes a false step; always he gives the gods the fatal opportunity they desire. Without that opportunity they could not act: the 1 We know from VIII. 398-9 that it was not absolutely fixed that Troy must be destroyed at that moment; it could have been saved for at least another ten years.</page><page sequence="12">22 L.E. MATTHAEI fates would not allow them: because the rule of fate is the rule of justice. But that is all that fate can do for inan; in the duel between man and gods (Nature, Fortune, Circumstance), man always throws away his vantage, and in pursuance of their own moral law the fates, far from siding with him, have to side against him. Obedience is the final victory; the right state of mind is a joyful acqui- escence (VIII. 133), and there is something approaching wickedness even in desiring anything except what fate means to send. To Palinurus, who desires the crossing of the Styx which fate cannot give him, the Sibyl's rebuke is stern (VI. 376). And though this need not prevent man from praying to fate (VIII. 575),' yet it is only the obedient man who is victorious, where the disobedient man, acting under compulsion, is a victim. Such a victim is Turnus, who in the end, in spite of all his rebellion and his courage, yields to his fates: 'iam iam fata, soror, superant, absiste morari; quo deus et quo dura vocat fortuna, sequamur' (XII. 676). It is clearly not the intention of Vergil to suppose that Turnus is as Aeneas, or that because both in the end do the bidding of fate therefore their actions are alike. Such a late yielding on the part of Turnus has little value, whereas the will of Aeneas had throughout co-operated with fate and is a part of the universal scheme, a necessary part if that scheme is to be completed. Only when the last of men has willingly obeyed, can the Perfect Will of fate be fulfilled; and therefore the disobedieuce of Turnus is a world-tragedy and a personal tragedy together. Thus, in the situation between man and the fates, we have a repetition of the situation between gods and the fates: man, like Juno, learns by experience that he must obey. Yet his obedience is not valuable until it is freely given: a compelled obedience--the result of force majeure-is a merely barren result. But Vergil has contrived to invest the human struggle with a dignity lacking to the divine; Aeneas and Turnus are worthier figures than Venus and Juno. In Vergil's eyes the disobedience of man is the most tragic thing in the universe. For it is just this discrepancy between the will of the whole and the disobedient wills of men which in a certain sense makes the action of fate necessary. Fate, as we have already seen, is the best possibilities of life (XI. I60). Fate includes the moral force which is continually at work trying to adjust what is still discrepant to itself, that desire or instinct of all things to seek their 7reXoq or appointed end, which both Plato and Aristotle postulated as the basis of their thought; perhaps just because it is so forcibly moral, so vehemently desirous for the approach of harmony, it becomes compulsive, almost tyrannical. This idea, a kind of rampant optimism, lies at the back of Vergil's tyranny of fate, I feel sure. But it is continually being crossed by the melancholy arising from the contemplation of the jar, the agony, which accompanies these inspiring and yet suffering processes of readjustment. At present the world is full of cruelty. So the fates are 'cruel,' 'crudelia' (I. 221), 1 Yet cf. VI. 376. quoted on p. g9.</page><page sequence="13">THE FATES, ETC., IN THE AENEID 23 'unjust,' 'iniqua' (II. 257, III. 17, X. 380, cf. VIII. 292), 'bitter,' 'acerba' (XI. 587), 'harsh,' aspera' (VI. 882). THE SUICIDE OF DIDO. I have defined the human struggle as worthier than the divine struggle. Now we come to a more startling difference between them. By far the most remarkable thing in the Aeneid is that whereas Vergil makes Jupiter conform to the fates, he allows Dido to defy them. Fate may be defined, in the Stoic sense, as the positive principle which brings order into the universe. Death is as much a part of it as life. Birth and death both take place according to certain laws, unexplained to us, but in themselves capable of explanation. And what we call death is only change; it means that a limited and determinate form of life is reabsorbed into the unlimited and more perfect source of life, the 'world-soul,' as the Stoics called it. Fate, the positive principle, works a continuous, endless and orderly cycle of the giving out and the taking back of portions of the world-soul. The characteristic of such a doctrine is that death is seen not as a contradiction and annihilation, a conundrum, but as a part of a reign of order. We see how wide is the distance between the Homeric view of death, and the ideas which could inspire such a passage as the famous one on the transmigration of souls in Aeneid VI. 724 sqq. But where the freewill of man chooses, it can, if it will, interfere with and disturb the working of this law and order. It cannot, it is true, prolong life beyond what is allotted, but it can do the opposite, cut life short before its ordained time. The human race has this strange and tragic power of self- annihilation. And this in two ways: a man can either cut short the life of another (murder), or his own (suicide). Murder we may leave aside at present; the rights of the third party, the murdered victim, so obviously complicate the situation. But in suicide the question is simplified down to the contest between yourself and 'fate.' The Stoics, who leaned on a very powerful and absorbing idea of prearranged events, were much exercised as to how to recon- cile that idea with any freewill in man; and in suicide one might say they saw their golden opportunity. Of course, the orthodox Stoic argued round suicide into being 'in conformity with nature' (cf. Cic. de Fin. III. ? 60), but that does not prevent it from being in reality an assertion of the right to disobey without sin. Hence the religious fervour of Stoic suicide: it was an affirmation of the freedom of man's will, an assertion not of pessimism, but of optimism. It was the capacity for suicide which lifted man above the beasts; I suppose beasts do not commit suicide, at any rate not in a reasoned, deliberate way like man. It is true that the soul of the suicide would only rejoin the world-soul, but all the same in suicide the Stoic affirmed his right to disobey. Admitting a theory of punishment after death, as Vergil does, we have an extremely important modification: we distinguish between 'merited' and 'unmerited' suicide. ' Unmerited suicide' is when a good man puts himself to</page><page sequence="14">24 L.E. MATTHAEI death; 'merited suicide' (I coin the expression) is when a crime-laden man does so. Now in the latter case there is no contradiction to the laws of fate: such an evil spirit only cumbers the earth: the right place for him is Hades or Tartarus. His suicide is therefore perfectly in accordance with fate. This will also give us a criterion in the more difficult sphere of murder and homicide. Where a man has been rightly condemned, he may be rightly executed: here human justice is doing its best to carry out the laws of fate, which be it always remembered are laws of justice. But where a man has wrongly been put to death, the laws of fate have beenoutraged. Such a victim is entirely on a par with the 'innocent' suicide. And that is exactly where we find him in the Aeneid, together with the suicide. Suicides, babes,' those who died on cruel false charges,' those who died for love, all dwell together on the threshhold of Hades (VI. 426 sqq.). A curious collection! But the link that connects them is not that they died by violence, 9tacolavarot, but that they died before their time, daepoc. In the case of babies we must suppose that it was some form of physical accident which slew them thus; this admits the possibility of a failure in physical nature (as in every other form of life), adequately to carry out the purposes of fate; we must beware of the modern idea of nature as the perfect, almost mechanical fulfilment of law; ancient philosophies, deriving from Aristotle, Phys. II. 5. 6, 197a, are capable of postulating a mistake in nature without any misgivings of heart. 'Those who died for love' I take to be different from the suicides; presumably they pined away, and they too are /oApot, 'before their time.' And of the suicides we should carefully note that Vergil expressly calls them 'insontes,' 'innocent,' in line 435; this limits the passage to those I called * unmerited suicides.' And because these four sets of souls are a contradiction to the order in things, an anomaly, they are neither completely in Hades nor completely outside it, but ' in limine primo,' no longer alive, and yet not having justly entered into the heritage of death. So Tertullian, who no doubt had Vergil in his mind, tells us that those who were cut off before their time had to continue to wander in the debatable region for just so long as corresponded with the remaining portion of time which should have been theirs on earth.' Further, note how Vergil says that those who were condemned on false charges on earth are not left ' without trial or without judge in the under- world': Minos holds the trial of them 'and learns of their life and the charges against them.' We must suppose that Minos will not accept the earthly verdict, but would satisfy himself whether the charges really were false: for if not false, then such persons cannot be said to have died before they ought; they would therefore not fulfil the conditions of those who are kept on the threshold of Hades: on the contrary, they will be rightly placed in Hades in accordance with the law of fate: their death will have been just. I take it ? De Anima, p. 56 sq. 'Aiunt et immatura morte praeuentas eo usque uagari istic, donec reliquatio compleatur aetatis, quam tumrn per- uixissent, si non intempestiue obissent.' I owe this quotation to Norden, Virgilstudien, Hermes, XXVIII. (x893), p. 372 sqq.</page><page sequence="15">THE FATES, ETC., IN THE AENEID 25 that if the charges are found to be true, such souls pass on with all other souls into Hades, there to suffer the due purificatory processes which shall cleanse them of guilt. This is why Vergil says that their dwelling-place (' sedes ') is 'not assigned to them without a judge'; for on the result of Minos' verdict will depend the place of their abode. To come to Dido: if Aeneas is the obedient, Dido is the defiant. Dido dies in defiance of her fate; her suicide is against the volition of the gods, an act of her own will, running counter to all the wise orderings of higher powers. At the same time neither is her death 'merited': she is an 'innocent' suicide (this does not mean that her passion is wholly without blame). She perishes 'before her day,' 'neither by fate nor by death deserved': nam quia nec fato merita nec morte peribat sed misera ante diem subitoque accensa furore (IV. 696). She kills herself in a sudden access of passion,'subito accensa furore.' The crux of the matter is this: Vergil puts the passion as the efficient cause of her death, and as the only efficient cause. It would have been open to him to have invented some connexion between this storm of passion and the will of fate; Jupiter, for instance, might have 'sent' the passion; this would have been exceedingly artificial. Otherwise, it was open to him to look on Dido's suicide as a wrong, a disobedience to the fates, like the sinful disobedience of Latinus and Turnus. I do not think he does so; Dido in Hades is not punished for her suicide. There is nothing for her but pity, nothing but accusation against whatever power pushed her on to such defiance of it. My impression is that Vergil, who clearly conceived the passion of Dido as a sin, was impelled to glorify her suicide, simply as an act of rebellion to an intolerable state of things. He comes very near to this attitude in the case of Turnus too, but he never quite reaches it,1 and therefore I have quoted Dido. For with all its waiting upon god, its patience and humility, its canonization of a suffering obedience, in the end the breaking-point comes even to the Vergilian spirit; it flees from the truths it has itself created, and endows defiance with a final power and a glory of its own. And therefore the suicide of Dido is at once the greatest inconsistency and also the crowning achievement of Vergil's philosophy. Through long and laborious vistas of thought, Vergil has faithfully toiled at his vision of a moral world; fate, the great ruler, is the power of god and the conscience of man: it is the rule of justice and the working of nature: it is the life of the universe and the meaning of good. But in the episode of Dido he throws the whole splendour of his worship away. He rises to the greatest artistic power of all, the power to criticize himself while he continues to create, the power to follow a great idea by a matchless criticism. The conduct and faith of Aeneas are splendid achievements; but as the passion of Dido un- erringly exposes his conduct, so does her suicide as unerringly challenge the whole system of the world and lay it in the dust. 1 Except, perhaps, in the last line of the poem.</page><page sequence="16">26 THE FATES, ETC., IN THE AENEID The whole effect of the poem is one of hesitation. On the one side there is what I have called the tyranny of fate; this tyranny I have traced to the enormously strong moral impulse of the poet: he pictures the moral passion in things, as it were, straining at the leash to run its course to its goal, which is the ultimate capacity of everything to attain perfection; but, on the other hand, there is the immense, the sacred power of rebellion. The very prominence he gives to the opposition of Juno, artificial and mechanical though the whole picture of the quarrels of the goddesses is: the extraordinary power with which Dido is made to defy not Aeneas, but the whole ordering of fate; in its way too, the overwhelming importance he places on the willing cooperation of Aeneas; the way in which he acknowledges the personal responsibility of each man (' quisque suos patimur manes,' VI. 743), and the unbreakable nature of man's spirit, which will defy even the mastery of death (X. 467); all this goes to show that Vergil's instinct was to stress the freedom of the will of man, which freedom, however, was most perfectly complete when it could manage to work in harmony with the Divine Soul which breathed through the universe. And unwilling to place himself finally on the one side or the other, torn between the inspiring thought of law in all things and the irresistible instinct of individuality, he invents a tender, a charming reconciliation between the two opposites, on the face of it superficial, yet perhaps containing the hint of a profounder truth. Dido died 'not by fate nor death deserved,' but ' before her time'; therefore her soul (' anima,' *vxu, i.e. portion of the world's lifebreath) could not escape her body, but struggled unavailingly (IV. 693 sqq.). Then Juno (here acting definitely with and for fate, as agent), in pity sent Iris to cut off the lock of hair, which was the signal that the due moment had come for the reabsorption of the finite life into the infinite, and so the struggling soul is allowed to escape. But an act of pity or grace is an act of power, and therefore we really return by this method to the supremacy of law and order, and simultaneously must admit at least the quasi-defeat of the freewill of man, if it is only by grace of god that Dido die. Nevertheless, let Juno herself confess it, it is an unavoidable act of grace: Dido in the end is as coercive of the gods as they are coercive of her. LOUISE E. MATTIIAEI.
