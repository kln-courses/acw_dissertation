<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Return of Keppetipola's Craniium Authenticity in a New Nafion Nira Wickramasinghe This paper aims to show that the national identity of the new nation state, Sri Lanka, owes much to the colonial articulation of Kandyan things as authentic, by looking at one particular event of the colonial period which is the return of artefacts from British museums and private collections in the last decade of British rule, especially the return of the cranium of the Kandyan hero Keppetipola. This event is an important example of the grammar in which colonial ideologies were deployed, and suggests, contrary to nationalist academic thinking, a direct lineage between the colonial and the post-colonial state. THE differentiation of the Sinhalese community into low-country and Kandyan Sinhalese, a division that was regional in origin, was a legacy of the European impact. It is commonly believed that the low-country Sinhalese of the southern and western coastal areas, more than two-thirds of the Sinhalese, as a result of four centuries of western influence tend to diverge somewhat in social practices and attitudes from the more 'traditional' Kandyans of the interior, who remained independent until 1815 and were subject to much later and less intense western influences. As a general rule according to the Report of the Census of Ceylon for 1921, Sinhalese who trace their descent to a low- country district - any of those in the western and southern provinces, the Chilaw district or the western part of the Puttalam district - are considered as low-country while the Kandyan Sinhalese trace their origin to the Central and North-Central Provinces, the provinces of Uva and Sabaragamuva, the Kurunegala district and part of the Puttalam district, the Sinhalesedivisionsof thedistricts of Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Mullaitivu.' Interpretations differ about the autonomy of the Kandyan culture. Obeysekere writes that "the Kandyan civilisation was not an old continuing tradition but a relatively new phenomenon with a heavy overlay of later south Indian influence".2 Dewaraja stresses that Kandy had become by the end of the 18th century a definite cultural zone with its own art and architecture, arts and crafts, dance and music. The importance of the Kandyan culture is that it has retained original Sinhala features, argues Dewaraja: indeed she writes "Any form of artistic expression that has survived in Sinhala society today owes its origin to or has derived inspiration from Kandy".3 Thus Sinhala in mainstream scholarship is unquestionably equalled with Kandyan. While acknowledging the influence of south India in dance and music (Vannam) in the Kandyan Kingdom, Dewarajaequates authenticity with Kandyan. Interestingly for Dewaraja who exemplifids the common perception, Kandyanness diluted in Nayakkar culture is considered authentically Sinhalese, while the symbiosis of low-country with Portuguese and Dutch cultures is considered hybrid. Clearly the determiningfactoristheKandyans' unfailing attachment to Buddhism and the resilience of what is considered 'tradition' due to the very insignificant missionary involvement during the colonial period in the Kandyan districts. In urban areas today, quite frequently Sinhalese/Buddhist young men and women of the middle classes get married in hotels. The 'traditional' 'poruwa' ceremony is performed with great pomp in a hall rented for the occasion. The couple, after the ceremony is over, is often seen leaving the hall to the beat of Kandyan drummers dressed in their sumptuous attire. What is curious, apart from the transformation of a village custom into an urban chic one, is the omnipresence ofthe Kandyan drummers who beat along joyfully even if the couple is of low-country descent. The Kandyan drummer plays the authentic rhythm of the nation. Another incarnation of this was related to me by an anthropologist studying the Kaffir community or Kabiri in Puttalam. The villagers of Kaffir descent were preparing for the national day celebrations in Colombo to which they were asked to send their representatives. An official who visited them while they were rehearsing apparently suggested adding a few Kandyan drummers to the Kaffir's item, probably to dampen the African beat of the Kaffir music. Even a little bit of Kandyanness meant authenticity. Similarly Sinhalese women in thediplomatic service when posted abroad most often wear the Kandyan saree on formal occasions and this without them having necessarily any link with the Kandyan region. In the same way the stewardesses on our national airline wear a modernised version of the Kandyan saree or 'osariya', while the stewards for a reason many anthropologists are still trying to fathom, are dressed in the wine coloured jackets which Parisian -waiters commonly wear. These examples illustrate how some Kandyan symbols have been selected to become part of the national heritage of the new nation. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate my contention that the national identity of the new nation state, Sri Lanka, owes much to the colonial articulation of Kandyan things as authentic, by looking at one particular event of the colonial period which is the return of artefacts from British museums and private collections in the last decades of British rule, especially the return of the cranium of the Kandyan hero Keppetipola. This event appears to me as an important example of the grammar in which colonial ideologies were deployed, and suggests, contrary to nationalist academic thinking, a direct lineage between the colonial and the post:colonial state. In so many ways, the states inherited from colonialism resemble the new nation-states: bureaucracy, education system, army, financial system are the most obvious areas. In other ways, there was a conscious effort on the part of nation builders to cut away from the colonial state and its ideology. Nationalist thought redefined the authentic nation and selected the symbols worthy of the new nation-state. What I wish to explore are the politics of selection, of what is remembered and forgotten, which took place in Sri Lanka in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the significance of the colonial ideology in this selection. I am not in any way suggesting that Kandyanness fonns the core of the new nation-state's self- image. Rather my hypothesis is that the definition of Kandyanness as 'authentic' in the nationalist era, and the widespread acceptance of this idea today is inextricably linked to an earlierdiscourse propounded by colonialism which privileged Kandyan symbols in a particular way. I The Return of Keppetipola's Cranium The cranium of Keppetipola, one of the leaders ofthe Great Rebellion of the Kandyan people in 1818, was returned to the Ceylon Economic and Political Weekly July 26, 1997 PE-85</page><page sequence="2">government on February 9, 1948, a few days after the country celebrated its independence from British rule. The Duke of Gloucester was instrumental in the return to the Colombo Museum of what the Ceylon Observer in 1948 referred to as a "national relic".4 Thus the cranium moved from one museum to another, exemplifying that post-independent states exhibit marked continuities with their colonial predecessors. In no uncertain terms, independent Ceylon had inherited the practice and form of political museumising that began in the 19th century with the growth ofcolonial archaeology. The origins of the Kandyan kingdom, situated in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, according to 'tradition' date back to the 15th century when Senasammatha Vikramabahu declared his independence from the king of Kotte around the year 1474. The full name of the kingdom was 'Kanda udapas rata' or the five districts. The Portuguese shortened it to Candea using the name for both the kingdomand its capital Senkadagalanuwara.5 In 1592 the kingdoms of Kotte and Sitawaka were absorbed by the Portuguese. The Kandyan kingdom was the last independent kingship, which maintained itself in the interior until March 1815 when it was ceded to the British by the Kandyan chiefs and the last king of Kandy Sri Vickrama Rajasingha was deposed. For over 300 years the Kandyan kingdom had withstood the full brunt of the military power in turn, of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British. With its demise, the entire island was for the first time subject to western political control. Keppetipola, also known as Monarawila, was Disawa of Uva in 1815 and was a signatory to the Kandyan Convention of March 2, 1815. He was the brother-in-law of Ehelepola, the last prime minister of the Kandyan kingdom. The Kandyan kingdom was formally ceded to the British by its leaders, secular and religious. The terms of the convention, signed on that date by Brownrigg on behalf of the British and by the chiefs on behalf of the Kandyans had been drafted largely by John D'Oyly. The document was read to the assembled chiefs and to the headmen of the districts gathered outside. The people took no part in this ceremony, and indeed the townspeople showed not the slightest interest in the proceedings. The Kandyan Convention pre- served intact the powers and privileges of the chiefs, the laws, customs and institutions of the country and what in the eyes of the Kandyans was more important than all else - the Buddhist religion. The Kandyan chiefs had however called in British help in 1815 for the sole purpose of eliminating an unpopular ruler. They had not contemplated the prospect of the establishment and continuation of British rule and when they woke up to the reality of foreign control they found it extremely irksome and unpalatable. The convention was thus a disappointment to the Kandyan elite who yearned for the restoration of the monarchy. They alleged that the British violated the conditions stipulated in the convention. From 1815 to 1817 a plan was hatched to overthrow British power in the Kandyan provinces. In August 1817 the Rebellion broke out in Vellassa. Keppetipola, as Disawa of Uva, assumed command and conducted the insurrection, which spread through the entire Kandyan country. The British who did not have adequate troops to quell the disturbance found themselves in a precarious condition. Martial law was proclaimed throughout the Kandyan provinces and reinforcements were brought from Madras. By August 1818 the Rebellion was fizzling out, a good many of the leaders having surrendered. In October Keppetipola and Madugalle, the second in command, were captured in the seven Korales, brought to Kandy, tried for levying war against the king and exe- cuted. On the morning of their execution Keppetipola and Madugalle were taken to the Dalada Maligawa, since they expressed the wish that they be allowed to pay their last respects to the sacred Tooth Relic. Keppetipola was Laken before the relic and after making obeisance, he offered one of the tuppatis which he was wearing, since he had nothing else to offer. Turning to Simon Sawes, the British agent in Kandy who had escorted him, he said: "I give you a share of the merit of my last meritorious act". He then expressed his 'pranthanaya', the last wish, namely, that he be bom in the Himalayas and attain Nibbana under Buddha Mettheya. The officiating high priest gave his benediction and said that the 'pranthanaya' would be fulfilled. After this Keppetipola and Madugalle were taken near the Bogambara Tank and executed. Immediately prior to the execution Keppetipola took out the Dhammapada, a book of Buddhist scriptures which he always carried and while he was reciting some stanzas from the text the executioner severed his head from the body with two strokes of the sword. Following the Kandyan custom the executioner placed the severed head on the breast of the fallen chieftain. What then happened to Keppetipola's cranium is somewhat curious. It was taken away from Ceylon and presented to the Phrenological Society of the Edinburgh Museum by Henry Marshall, chief surgeon of the Kandyan Provinces between 1816 and 1821 . Phrenology, first known as cranioscopy was founded by the German anatomist Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828). There was at the time great interest in methods of determining character and temperament from external bodily configurations, especially the facial, and Gall evolved a new method called cranioscopy, combining the concepts of cerebral localisation with the analysis of bodily configurations. He argued that faculties or talents are inborn and dependent upon cerebral structures: therefore the brain is made up of as many 'organs' or areas as there are moral and intellectual qualities. Character and intellect are represented by 27 organs, or psychic qualities, sharply delineated on the cranial surface. Skulls of 'heroes' or any men displaying exceptional qualities would be particularly sought after as case studies. This interest in skulls was not in any way new. In the 17th century scientists were making observations on the morphologyofthechimpanzeeandtheorang- outang. The early 18th century saw the beginning of anthropology with the works of Buffon, Linne, Camper, Daubenton and others. In the 19th century, anthropology officially took a place at the university as the natural history of mankind. Craniology was among the most important subjects taught. Parallel to this, the first anthro- pological museums and the first collections of skulls were created. Appropriately Gall's cranium is still preserved in the Paris Museum, Musee de l'Homme. The stigma earned by phrenology was mainly due to its popularisers. Gall himself was much more a man of the 18th century Enlightenment; he was a social reformer who deduced moral rules from his phreno- logy.6 In the 19th century, scientists believed that science would be able to explain how a man belonging to an inferior race could act with such bravery. Scientific mastery was thus an important part of the colonial endeavour to control the physical world and was central to the works of social darwinists such as Spencer. In India, H H Risley, census commissioner and ethnologist sought to demonstrate in his book, People of India, that the social status of the members of the various caste groupings varied 'in inverse ratio to the mean relative width of their noses'.' Most ethnographers of the late 19th century accepted the notion that anthropomorphic research had some value and measured skulls as part of their mapping preoccupation. Knowing the native meant governing more effectively.8 Colonial subjects were objectified, scrutinised and classified. For this purpose, museums were established. Anderson has defined the museum, together with the map and the census as an institution of power that "shaped the way in which the PE-86 Economic and Political Weekly July 26, 1997</page><page sequence="3">colonial state imagined its dominion - the nature of the human beings it ruled, the geography of its domain and the legitimacy of its ancestry".9 British colonialism was not alone in the collection and collating of such material. As late as in the 1950s, the museum of Bremen contained no less than two thousand skulls from the colonial territories, out of which 84 from German-East Africa were arranged in rows according to their cephalic index."' Thus craniums were not only studied by the 'rational' minds of the time, they were also exhibited in museums for the consumption of the metropolitan crowds. Britain had by 1900, 250 natural history museums, and by 1910 more than 2,000 science and natural history museums had been established throughout the world." The Colombo Museum was established by Sir William Gregory, the governor of the island. In his speech to the legislative council he explicitly conveyed what were in his view the aims of a museum: The want of a museum, in which may be represented the natural history, antiquities, and industrial products of the island, has been forcibly urged on me...For a comparatively small sum, considering the object in view, a museum may be constructed which shall not be a mere random collection of mis- cellaneous objects, but a scientific, teaching exhibition, which while ministering to the amusement of many, may convey instruction to all who seek it.'2 The purpose of the Colombo museum was articulated as two-fold, amusement at the sight of objects of wonderment, and education. In 1877 it opened its doors to the public. By 1915 the museum had improved tremendously. Visitors were able to wander through new exhibits from the mineral gallery, the mammalian gallery to the medieval gallery. Exhibits were labelled so as to inform and educate the visitors. A recent addition in 1915 was a wooden four- poster bed of massive proportions which bore the following inscription: This bed belonged to the last king of Kandy Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe. In January 1815, the king fled to Madamahanuwara. During his absence the palace was ransacked by different people. Molligoda Adigar took the Royal bed and it was in his possession until his death on October 26, 1823.'3 The history or rather the story of the bed was thus encapsulated in an explanatory vignette by colonial archaeologists. Post- colonial museumising would follow the same model of displaying selected items behind glass frames thus elevating them to the status of reified exhibits. Just as in the colonial museum each object is then vested with one explanation, one label. The story of the bed, for instance, is almost certainly more complex than that contained in the museum label. But in the colonial as well as in the post-colonial museum, its story is limited, circled to the part it played in the Kandyan Rebellion. Modern museums used the same framework and joyfully classified and labelled all the items thus carrying on the spirit of the Enlightenment. The museum that grew out of a typical 19th century colonial concern to collect knowledge about the Other and offer a selective representation of this knowledge to the natives, thus standing as an objective demonstration of the colonial appropriation of the world, later became the location for the self-definition of the new nation-state. The reversal of this powerful symbolic process central to colonisation, and probably to all forms of hegemony, took place with the return of objects such as Keppetipola's cranium. The meaning of artefacts was never more contextual. Keppetipola's cranium while in Edinburgh was part of the knowledge system of colonialism. With its return to the Colombo museum in 1948 it became the symbol of the new and independent nation- state. The transformation of the museum is more ambiguous. While the reason of the establishment of the museum can be traced to the prevailing orientalist fashion, the state had its own non-scientific reasons. Among these was the possible use of the museum as a way of legitimising colonial rule. Indeed showing the past grandeur of the Sinhalese was nothing less than an indiction of the contemporary natives who were no longer capable of their ancestors' achievements. II Paradox of Colonialism: Kandyans as Allies It is a paradox that in the British empire the very men who conquered lands in the name of modern civilisation valued, the 'native aristocracy' far more than the upwardly mobile western educated sections of the local population. Ranger has shown how Europeans in colonial Africa thought of customary practices with respect and valued the age-old prescriptive rights. They did not fail to compare the sort of title which an African chief held with the gentlemanliness which they laid claim to themselves.'4 In Palestine a basic element in the British perception of the Arab majority was that Palestinians were degenerate Levantines of mixed race and questionable character as opposed to the 'authentic' Arab who was the desert Bedouin, gentleman by birth.'5 The Brahmin in India was given pride of place as shown by Richard Westmacott's 1 83Ostatueof Warren Hastings accompanied by two Indians out of which one is tall, classically proportioned brahmin with a shaven head and topknot and the other a seated munshi or scribe bearded and turbaned, the latter representing the Muslims and the former the Hindus.16 Thus the authentic Hindu was the brahmin just as the authei'tic Sinhalese was the high caste Kandyan, guardian of the admirable qualities of tradition. British respect went to what was regarded as the "real native not the hybrid, university trained mule". 7 But just as in India where the English educated declared themselves committed to the common good and to progress, insisting that they and not the aristocratic notables represented the larger public, in Sri Lanka, the westernised elite mainly from the low- country tried to show they were more worthy of trust than the feudal Kandyan chieftain. This trust was to be gained painstakingly by the Ceylon National Congress which spearheaded the struggle for independence from the second decade of the 20th century onwards. When Ceylon gained independence in 1948, it was clear that the British had chosen to trust the men whom they so despised a few decades ago. The evolution of the attitude ofthe colonial rulers towards the Kandyans offers a parallel to their attitude towards the nationalist movement dominated by low-country Sinhalese. As one lost ground the other gained. As independence became a possibility, colonial rule shifted its support to the modernising forces in society. The turning point was the sittings of the Donoughmore Commission of 1927 where the federal scheme of the Kandyans was rejected. KANDYANS AS 'OPPRESSED MINORTY' In the 1920s govemorManningreactivated the ideology of racial differences and through purely political manoeuvres led two groups, the Kandyans and the Ceylon Tamils, to claim minority status. His policy was directed at creating enduring divisions within the elite while organising the estrangemeht of minorities from the Ceylon National Congress (CNC). Why he felt that crippling the Congress was worth dispensing so much effort remains obscure. Manning knew that the CNC would represent a danger if it acquired national status, and if it succeeded in convincing the Colonial Office that it spoke for all communities even though the political game was restricted to a chosen few. But there was no real risk of the CNC obtaining a Gandhian type of following owing to the dominance of the conservatives in its fold. In the case of the Kandyans, Manning was in fact motivated, not only by a desire to use Kandyan dissent as a counterpoise to the reform movement Economic and Political Weekly July 26, 1997 PE-87</page><page sequence="4">domiinated by low-country Sinhalese men, but also by real sympathy with the Kandyan high caste aristocracy (Radalas) who crystallised the sense of collective grievance and political deprivation experienced by the Kandyan peasants. The Kandyan region was regarded by provincial agents and the British in general as the epitome of tradition, and they often displayed a patriarchal and protective attitude towards the Kandyans. The Kandyan Sinhalese had been registered separately from the low-country Sinhalese forthefirsttimeinthe 1901 Census, forming from then on the second largest community. Inhabitants of the ihterior of the island, namely, the Central, Uva, Sabaragramuwa and North-Central Provinces, were included amongst the Kandyan Sinhalese. In 1921, the Kandyans numbered 1,089,097 thus accounting for 24.2 per cent of the total population.'8 They were less literate and having held out for two centuries longer against western penetration than the low- country Sinhalese, led lives based mainly on the village and ownership of land largely untouched by the commercial developments which had followed the exploitation of tea and rubber estates. The inroads made by British capital had, however, created the need for a subordinate entrepreneur- ship. Low-country Sinhalese had filled the void. In the 19th century, the antagonism between government agents and these low-country Sinhalese traders, labourers and arrack renters who settled in the Kandyan province following the planta- tion boom was widespread.'9 There were many who interpreted the history of the plantation era as a conflict between high caste Kandyans and low-country inter- lopers and sustained the impression that Kandyans differedfundamentally from low- country Sinhalese. Manning's vision of Ceylonese society was in continuity with these ideas. Thus, when Kandyan leaders began to echo the voice of the provincial agents and appropriate their arguments to press for more political power, Manning lent them unconditional support. The crux of the discord between Kandyans and low-country Sinhalese was the discrepancy, real or perceived, in the distribution both of dejure power resources - that is, the power re- sources which accrued to each individual by virtue of his citizenship in the state, in particular his right and ability to petition the government and organise political action - and de facto power resources such as education and wealth. The most articulate members of the Kandyan community invariably translated this senseofdeprivation into remedial political activity. Manning's task was easy. It consisted in canalising Kandyan fears and discontent and presenting their case in a supportive manner to the Colonial Office. Kandyan leaders clearly did feel threatened by the Colombo reform leaders. The 'Ceylonese' nationalismthatthey articulated was perceived as the announcement of political domination by the low-country Sinhalese and the extinction of Kandyan culture and tradition. J N 0 Attygalle used harsh words against the 'Ceylonese Britishers' whom he denounced en bloc as 'nouveaux riches', professional politicians or adventurers, upstarts who were 'averse to be called by their racial names Sinhalese and Tamils which provoked inquiries from outsiders as to the places assigned to them socially by long usage and custom'.20 In the Kandyan view it was inconceivable that the CNC should arrogate to itself the right to speak for the whole country. In 1920 there was considerable agitation for a substantial increase in the number of unofficial members in the Legislative Council. Congress pressed for the abolition of communal representation and for territorial election and sent a reform deputation to meet Viscount Milner, the secretary of state for the colonies.2' The Kandyan ranks were divided. T B Kobbekaduwa, a prominent Kandyan, addressed a message to his community just before his departure to England in which he sttesses the necessity for a relationship based on trust if there were to be ethnic harmony in Ceylon: "Scorn the idea that a general electorate does threaten us with extermination or the domination of us by others".22 Immediately prompted by Manning, a segment of the Kandyan elite sent a rival deputation composed of three lawyers of radala status: J A Halangoda, G E Madawala and T B Moonemalle to London in June 1920. They pressed for the ratio of seats (i e, five out of 13) which'the Kandyan Association - formed in 1917 - had deemed necessary to ensure their distinctiveness in a reformed legislative council.23 Manning, on his side, urged the Colonial Office to recognise the Kandyans as a minority community which needed to be represented in the reformed council by members elected on a franchise confined to Kandyans.24 Convincing the Colonial Office and the House of Commons, however, that the Kandyans formed an oppressed minority which could only be protected by extendings the communal principle to them presented some difficulty. In the Commons the under- secretary of state was a solitary voice in favour of communal representation. He was strongly attacked by Col J C Wedgewood of the Labour Party who believed that "consolidation of communal representation under representative government was a method used to divide and rule".25 Finally, unable to withstand Manning's unremitting pressureMilneryieldedtoKandyandemands. The Kandyans were allowed to elect their representatives through communal electorates and Manning gloated over the paucity of concessions made to the Congress delegation. The 1920 reforms were based on the 'balance of power' theory advocated and practised by Manning. Arunachalam who had led the Congress delegation had nursed hopes for something comparable to the Montague-Chelmsford reforms and had therefore strong reason to be disappointed. Representation had been so arranged that, in the words of the secretary of state, "every community shall be represented and while there is a substantial non-official majority, no single community can impose its will on other communities if the latter are supported by official members".26 For the Kandyan community it meant a mere addition of one more representative. The victory, largely symbolic, was of importance. From this point onwards the Kandyan political leadership had the option of choosing between two possible allies: the low-country Sinhalese majority orthe minority group thus assuming a minority identity. Manning had succeeded in making their stand as aminority acceptable to those in control. POLITICAL AWAKENING In 1924 Kandyans began to take an active part in politics. At the elections to the legislative council held that year, Kandyan electorates having been changed into territorial electorates, only three Kandyans were elected for seven Kandyan seats. The CNC had assured Kandyan leaders that Kandyan electorates would not be contested by the low-country nominees ofthe Congress. The CNC was not, however, a party capable of imposing discipline upon its members and preventing low-country Congressmen from being elected in Kandyan areas. The political setback of the Kandyans at the elections of 1924 acted as a catalyst. An editorial interpreted the Kandyan defeat as the result of political ignorance: "The Kandyans have underrated the difficulties and trusted too much to their influence and prestige. They have never taken the trouble to grasp the intricacies of western politics".27 What was in fact suggested was that the Kandyan candidates did not have a party capable of spreading their views in an organised campaign and still relied on their personal entourage for this purpose. The advice was well taken. In November 1924, a meeting was convened in the Kandy Town Hall to. discuss the formation of an association of Kandyans based in Kandy. Speakers one PE-88 Economic and Political Weekly July 26, 1997</page><page sequence="5">after the other referred to the Kandyan Convention, to the necessity to safeguard the rights accruing to them underthe Convention and to the intrigues of Colombo Congressmen against the Kandyans.28 Most Kandyan members of the CNC, T B Kobbekaduwa, P B Ratnayake and others moved away from Congress and founded a new political associationofKandyan Sinhalese dominated by the chieftain class: the Kandyan National Assembly (KNA). At the first session of the KNA a ceremony destined to re-enact the past and herald the future took place. The spirit of conciliation with colonial rule was propagated: the national identity of the Kandyans was stressed and their privileged relationship with the Crown and its agents was also symbolically emphasised. Indeed the Union Jack was hoisted on the esplanade opposite the Dalada Maligawa; Kandyan chiefs in their national uniform took up their post at the flagstaff and after the long drum (Magul Bera) had been sounded, Kandyan drummers played on, ancient Sinhalese guns fired in salutation and the Kandyan national song was sung. In his presidential address P B Nugawela declared: "We are at the beginning of a great and high adventure namely the rebuilding of our nationality".29 Appearing before the Donoughmore Commission for constitutional reform in 1927, the representatives of the KNA reiterated their self-perception now not just as a nationality but as a nation, and proposed a federal scheme for the country:30 "Ours is not a communal claim or a claim for the aggrandisement of a few: It is a claim of a nation to have the right to live its own life and realise its own destiny". Much of the Kandyan case was built on an interpretation of the Kandyan Convention of 1815, which they claimed was an argument between "two sovereign and equal nations". They did not accept the view that the Proclamation of 1818, which had followed the Kandyan rebellion of 1817-18 against the British presence, had made the Convention invalid. Interestingly the Kandyan National Association tried to build a national identity without ever referring to the role of the British in the fall of their kingdom. It was an enterprise of historical selectivity and rectification. The anniversary of the rebellion was conveniently forgotten, as it was not deemed necessary in the 1 920s to antagonise the British after so many years of peace and friendship. The scheme the KNA put forward before the Donoughmore Commission entailed the division of the country into three different states, one consisting of the five Kandyan provinces, one of the two Tamil provinces and one of the two low-country provinces. In each of these states there would be a legislative council and an executive council to deai with certain matters, for example, education, agriculture, provincial administration, land, medical services and the minor judiciary and substantial control over local revenues to meet expenditure under these heads. The central or federal government would have in its charge matters that concerned the whole island, military, public works and railways, for instance.3' It is interesting to note that in the 1920s, plans for federal forms of government were very much in the air. In 1926, S W R D Bandaranaike had supported such a scheme anddeclared: "A thousand and one objections could be raised against the systems but when the objections are dissipated I am convinced that some form of federal government would be the only solution.32 However, the Donoughmore Commission was well aware that the KNA was expressing the views of feudal chiefs and headmen who were trying to protect their vested interests against the threat of a Ceylon, dominated by the more progressive low-country Sinhalese. Opposed to the KNA and supported by the Congress were organisations such as the Maha Jana Sabhas and the Sangamayas. The Maha Jana Sabhas were not exclusively Kandyan associations. Most of them were led by low-country Sinhalese Congressmen of the area. The Sangamayas were more specificallv composed of Kandyans, catered for the lower caste Kandyans and stood for the abolition of communal representation.33 Of the existence of such organisations opposed to the Kandyans of high birth, the commissioners had been notified. The Madhyama Lanka Maha Jana Sabha, for instance, had asked thegovernorin a telegram dated November7, 1927, to intervene against the 'coercion employed by the KNA through village headmen' to obtain signatures from villagers for a memorial demanding self- government in the Kandyan provinces.34 Moreover 't soon became clear that the feasibility of the KNA scheme was doubtful and the motives behind it self-serving although it articulated thenew self-perception of the Kandyan leadership projecting the image no longer of a minority but of a nation. The Kandyan leadership's refusal to identify with the rest of the Sinhalese in spite of the obvious similarities existing between them had reached a new peak during the Donoughmore sittings. The Donoughmore Report rejected the Kandyan federal scheme. One of the main reasons put forward by the commissioners was that a federal scheme would once again isolate the Kandyan community. From the 1930s onwards colonial rule did not encourage the Kandyans to develop a separate political identity. The British had decided to throw in their lot with the moderates of the Ceylon National Congress whofaute de mieux represented the forces of unity and Westminster-style constitutional pro- gress. But they continued to harbour the feeling that the 'Kandyans' were more authentic and therefore worthy of special respect. On occasions when the etiquette was-breached such as in a 1938 Buckingham palace reception when Peiris, a Sinhalese of the low-country, wore a uniform similar to one of a Kandyan chief, the British expressed their outrage. A British civil servant referred to Peiris disparagingly as "a member of the karava community of inferior social status in no way related to the Kandyans" .35 III Absorption of Kandyanness by Colonialism and Nationalism RELIGIO-CULTURAL NATIONALISM OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY In the early 20th century, the proponents of Sinhalese-Buddhist nationalism emerged as the most prominent group within the religio-cultural mainstream of political activity. The brunt of the attacks by Christianity and its evangelical elements had been borne by the Buddhists who formed the largest single religious community. The Buddhist revival of the late 19th century gave rise to two movements of protest. The social and religious reformers, Angarika Dharmapala and Walinsinha Harischandra, led a campaign to protect places of Buddhist worship. They were also leaders of the temperance movement.36 Temperance had a dual purpose. First it served to reiterate Buddhist strictures against alcohol which amounted to the assertion anew of the validity and relevance of Buddhist values after years of acquiescence in the values of the foreign rulers. Secondly, it represented on the political plane a move to attack the excise policy as an important source of British revenue.37 With the temperance movement there was an attempt to unite the masses using reli- gion, Buddhism and anti-Christianity, as binding forces. At the beginning of 1915, this religio-cultural stream of nationalism and the agitation of the constitutional reformists were showing signs of con- vergence: this was apparent at the celebra- tion of the centenary of the Kandyan Convention in March and at the National Day celebration in April.38 Interestingly, this early nationalism propounded by men from the low country such as Dharmapala, chose Kandyan symbols for the new nation they were imagining. The Economic and Political Weekly July 26, 1997 PE-89</page><page sequence="6">most telling illustration is the dress reform movement Dharmapala spearheaded to restore Sinhalese pride in their culture. The osariya, today known as the Kandyan saree, which was considered the true national dress for the Sinhalese woman was promoted by lay preachers throughout the country. One can speculate on the reasons for the choice of the osariya as opposed to the cloth and jacket. One possible explanation is that the national dress had to be decorative and flattering as well as regal since it represented the newly-regained pride of the Sinhalese. But at the same time clothes had to be modest and 'decent': women were not encouraged to expose their navel or their ankles. The saree was the morally acceptable dress as it covered the entire body. Dharmapala's recommendations on "how females should conduct themselves" were quite clear in that respect: A proper blouse should cover the breast, stomach and back completely, a cloth 10 riyans long should be worn as the osariya or saree.39 Another possible reason for the choice of the osariya as the national dress was its Kandyan origin. While the low country was subjected to an array of cultural influences, the Kandyan kingdom had protected its purity. Portuguese, Dutch and British presence in the island had led to many imitations and syntheses in the dress of the Sinhalese. With the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century the great majority of women on the coastal belt took to the Portuguese long sleeved jacket rounded at the back and in the front with a V neckline. In the mid- 17th century, under the influence of the puritanical Dutch, lace collars, frills and hemlines began to be freely used. In the early 19th century, urban women took to wearing European dresses, skirts and blouses. The osariya was seen not only as the 'moral dress', but also as the authentic, unspoiled and 'pure' dress of the Sinhalese.40 In the years that followed, the religio- cultural stream of nationalism was overrun by the more modernist and secular reform movement led by the CNC. In the late 1 930s, however the predominantly low-country Sinhalese nationalist movement began to look upon the 'conservative traditionally minded' Kandyans as allies. COURTING THE KANDYANS: SINHiALA MAHA SABHA The Sinhala Maha Jana Sabha (SMS) is said to have been founded by Bandaranaike in 1934.4' Its purpose was clearly stated at the outset: to safeguard the legitimate interests of the Sinhalese race. The aim of the Sabha was to bridge the schism between the Sinhalese communities divided into a low-country and a Kandyan group as well as mutually competing castes. Only after this first step had been taken was it possible to work towards a higher unity, a unity of all communities. Although the SMS was a unit within the CNC, it acted as a rival rather than a partner to the Congress, undermining its national or at least pan-Sinhalese pretensions. The Kandyan political leadership had, from the inception of the nationalist movement, stood aloof from it, owing to its predominantly low-country Sinhalese composition. In 1937, thedifferent grievances of the Kandyan community were expressed in a memorandum by G G Rambukpota, state councillor for the Bibile area. Only five Kandyans had been returned in the 20 seats allotted to the Kandyan provinces. Kandyan candidates lacked funds compared to the low-country Sinhalese men, who he said, 'had money behind them'. Another new danger came from those agitators who preached communist ideas to the plantation workers. It was for all these reasons, he argued, that it was necessary to limit the franchise by an education and property qualification.42 Another memorial from the Kandyans denounced both the low-country Sinhalese and the Indians: the Indian labourers, "servants of the European planter [who] are to be our masters and rulers", should be excluded from territorial electorates and given representation as agricultural labour on a communal or interest basis.43 A few years later, Kandyan fears of political extinction were articulated more forcefully by the rejuvenated Kandyan Youth League which had been inaugurated in 1934.44 All these demands were the work of men belonging to the higher rungs of Kandyan society, mainly of radala caste. It was not surprising therefore, that among the requests of the Kandyan Y'outh League had been the preservation of the headmen system though the request failed. The Sinhala Maha Sabha' s position towards Indians was aimed very much at comforting Kandyan apprehensions. It denounced the manner in which the restrictions on theIndian franchiseembodied in the Donoughmore Constitution had failed to maintain any restrictions at all. The evidence of five years residence which was one of the requirements, was not insisted upon, and- the second requirement, which was to sign a declaration of permanent settlement, had been a mere formality.45 At meetings of theS M S Bandaranaike projected a deliberate assimilation of Indian labourers with the imperialist power and preached a bleak future: "...before many years pass, we will cease to exist as a people and a few miserable survivors will be left as the slaves of Indian slaves of the British".46 In the official perception he grew to become the 'protagonist of the Sinhalese crusade against Indians'.47 At the end of the 1930s, the Kandyan leadership began to think of Bandaranaike as a possible ally. Similarly the Kandyan Youth League was seen by the S M S as a useful organi- sation which could be absorbed in due course and brought under the control of the Sabha. In 1939, at the celebration of Convention Day organised by the League, Bandaranaike was the principal speaker. On the same day, in Colombo, the national day was celebrated, thus symbolising the growing links between the two Sinhalese communities. The following year, on the same occasion other low-country Sinhalese members of the SMS, such as C W W Kannangara, or A E Goonesinha of the Labour Party, were present. The 1941 celebration was attended by 1,500 to 2,000 people. D S Senanayake, Bandaranaike, and Kannangara were participants. Panabokke Adigar, who was presiding, appealed to his 'low-country brethren' to consider the Kandyans as their young brothers, to co-operate with them and to lead them as "an elder brother on the path of progress, to obtain independence".48 The language was one of dependence. From this time onwards, Bandaranaike and his Sabha were to a large measure instrumental in forging a stronger sense of cohesion between the Sinhalese communities. His marriage to a Miss Ratwatte, daughter of Disava Barnes Ratwatte was of great sociological and political importance. As governor Caldecott remarked in 1940, the union between a first rank family of the Kandyan highlands with afilrst ranking family of the low lands represented an accretion of considerable political influence to the SMS.49 The new links between the SMS and the Kandyan leadership were grounded more in a personal trust than on a reflected common platform. Although the Indian issue had brought them together it was S W R D Bandaranaike as a person who guaranteed the Kandyan elite that their voice will be heard. Kandyan support for the nationalist cause was also reinforced by the incorporation of its traditional leaders in the governance of the country. In 1944, the board of ministers recommended that a Kandyan, Sir T B Panabokke, first Adigar, who had represented Kandyan interests in the old legislative council, be appointed Ceylon Representative to India as successor to the late Sir Baron Jayatilaka. This choice was indubitably PE-90 Economic and Political Weekly July 26, 1997</page><page sequence="7">motivated by political considerations, at a time when it was crucial to present before the British an image of conciliation. The low-country Sinhalese were no longer considered as 'foreigners', invaders or interlopers. The relationship evolved into one of acceptance by the Kandyans of the benevolent dominance of the low-country Sinhalese. The nationalist movement had succeeded in co-opting the Kandyan political leadership. COLONIAL RECONCILIATION Parallel to the nationalist movement's overtures to the Kandyans and event,ual absorption of Kandyan symbols into the new nation, the colonial rulers were defining what in their view were the emblems of the 'authentic' Ceylon. The return of artefacts they had taken away was only one aspect of a wider process. Indeed during the 1930s and 1940s, the colonial rulers actually participated in defining what they thought was the uniqueness of Sinhalese civilisation. The study and preservation of Sinhglese texts was encouraged. The famous German orientalist, Wilhelm Geiger, completed the translation of the Sinhalese chronicle, The Mahavamsa, in 1908. A few years later, the government of Ceylon considered inviting him to the island to catalogue the manuscri pts owned by the Buddhist monasteries, but the outbreak of the first world war aborted this project. In 1925, however, Geiger, under the patronage of the British government in Colombo undertook to edit and translate from the Pali the second part of the Sinhalese chronicle, The Culavamsa.50 There was also a renewed interest in the Sinhalese language. At the end of the 19th century, the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society had conceived the idea of a critical philological dictionary of Sinhalese. The original plan was revived in 1925. The explicit aims were a better understanding of the language and the building up of a "really fine modern Sinhalese literature".5' Colonial rulers were probably more concerned with appeasing the culture conscious members of the nationalist movement by displaying interest in the local culture. In 1926, work began with the Ceylon government guaranteeing full support. This set the trend. In 1935, the colonial secretary constituted a commission headed by Pakeman which aimed at preserving public records, col- lecting unpublished manuscripts, and translating and publishing Sinhalese documents. There was also a new benevolent attitude in regard to indigenous arts and medicine. Thus, the traditional British position that the local population should be shielded from 'quack' medicine, was abandoned in 1927 when state sponsorship was given to indigenous systems of medicine.52 Indeed during the last decades of British rule, demands for the restoration of Buddhist relics held in museums in Great Britain began to be received with some amount of sympathy by British authorities in Ceylon. In 1939, the Ananda Bikkhu Sangamaya forwarded a resolution to the secretary of state requesting that the relics of the venerable Sariputta and Moggalana lying in the Victoria and Albert Museum be returned.53 Governor Caldecott acted as the intercessor on this occasion as well as a few years later for the return on an ivory tooth representing the Sacred Tooth of Buddha in the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.54 Most of the objects returned had been taken away from temples and their return to their original place can be read as a symbolic redemption for past sacrileges. There was also some concern over the use that nationalists could put to these relics if the British clung on to them. The return of these objects can further be read as an acknowledgement that the objects deemed significant enough to be taken away and displayed in western museums were the very objects deemed important by the nationalists. Thus Buddhist relics were placed very high in the list of objects to be returned. There were other objects too that were returned to Ceylon during this period. In instance after instance the mode of presentation of the 'gift' being returned exemplified the British perception of a nation which was essentially Sinhalese and Buddhist and which privileged and Kandyan heritage. In 1934, the Hindu Organ reported that "before a large assembly gathered in the audience hall the Duke of Gloucester returned to the people of Ceylon the throne and crown of the kings of Kandy".5" The fact that these symbols of Kandyan royalty were initially to be handed over to a social entity called Ceylonese and were to be placed in the state council chamber instead of the ancient Kandyan audience hall, and this in spite of protests on the part of the Kandyan chiefs, reveals the British views of Ceylon as a unified nation as well as the willingness of the ministers to construct aSinhalese identity privileging the prestigious Kandyan heritage. It was only later that the throne was brought to Kandy. Interestingly Sri Wickrama's ceremonial throne and footstool had been fashioned by the Dutch in 1692 as a present for the then king. It was probably made either by southern Indian or Sinhalese craftsmen. The throne was covered in gold sheeting and encrusted with jewels, its arms were a pair of lions of Sinhala, and a large sun, symbolising the origin of the Kandyan monarchs, surmounts its back. The Kandyan throne's authenticity could have been questioned. After all was it not an object modelled in the Dutch style and sculpted possibly by south Indian craftsmen? Although it had been customary for them to rule from the cushioned 'gaddi', the Kandyan kings had used this Dutch made throne ever since they had acquired it. After the 1818 rebellion, it was shipped toEngland, together with the lion-standard of the king, in the custody of Brownriggs son who was charged to present it to the prince Regent. There is further irony in the fact that this throne was used throughout the 19th century at Windsor Castle for the ceremony of investing knights of the Garter.i6 This renewal of interest in the Kandyan heritage is also evident in the requests for the return of a Kandyan gun in 1939 to the national museum from Dublin, additional articles of the Regalia of the last king of Kandy from Windsor Castle in 1936, and a painting of the Dutch governor receiving ambassadors from the king of Kandy from the Royal Asiatic Society in 1937. As independence loomed theliterateclasses in Ceylon grew more concerned that a variety of Ceylon's antiquities, including Keppetipola's cranium were deposited in museums and private collections abroad. An editorial in 1947 recalled the "large haul of ancient coins discovered in Gampola which found its way to America" and urged the Ceylon government to take India's request that Indian antiquities including the celebrated diamond which adorns the Imperial Crown be restored to the Indian people as an example. The return of objects which were part of the 'national heritage' was especially mentioned.57 On September 23, 1947 the governor invited D S Senanayake, the leader of the UNP to form a cabinet as his was the party that had won the largest number of seats at the elections. The next day, after a formal ceremony held in Kandy and a religious offering of flowers at the Maligawa shrine, D S Senanayake addressed the nation in English, Sinhalese and Tamil. These acts summarised the tensions underlying a seemingly peaceful transfer of power. Kandy symbolished tradition and purity from foreign influences, the Maligawa symbolised allegiance to Buddhism and the trilingual address symbolised the acceptance of plurality. The new nation was an interesting conglomerate. The return of Keppetipola's cranium, built up by both the colonial rulers and the nationalist leadership as authentic treasure/inheritance of the new nation, symbolised the contradictions of nation- building in this land, its richness and its tensions.
