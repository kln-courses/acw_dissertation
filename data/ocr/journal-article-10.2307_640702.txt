<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hole of Dreams in Religious EnCulturation among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea ROGER IVAR LOHHMANN ABSTRACT Dreams play an important and often underesti- mated role in cultural transmission because they provide per- sonal experiential verification of incoming information. Dreams facilitated the reception of religious beliefs among the Asabano before, during, and after their conversion to Christianity. As- abano hold the "classic" view that dreams are real experiences of the soul. Therefore, dream encounters with supernaturals provide evidencefor such beings' existence and power. The As- abano case suggests that, as evidence, dreams are vital, espe- cially in the transmission of extraordinary religious ideas. I n the early morning in Yakob village, all is fresh from the rains that fall almost every night. The sun shines warmly upon the drenched land, and the Fu River can be heard rushing far below. The rainforest-cov- ered mountains begin to poke through the mists that envelop them, while smoke from morning fires sifts through the leaf thatching of houses. Gentle murmurs grow into conversations, babies cry, and sleepy dogs occasionally yelp as they are slapped to get out of the way. Asabano people awaken to such a scene each day, with their dreams still fresh in their minds. On such a morning, after the mists had cleared away and the sun was shining intensely to the accompaniment of the songs of a dozen species of birds, a young woman named Lin, after finishing her breakfast of sweet potatoes baked in the ashes of the hearth, was deep in thought. She pro- ceeded up Samlai hill, which rises above the village to the house of the dablesebobu: the white man from America who had come to live with her people and learn about their culture. I was interested in religion, but I was not a Christian, which made me anomalous in Asabano eyes. Lin had Ethos 28(1):75--102.

We sat on the floor with cups of coffee, and I asked her if she thought the Holy Spirit and angels truly exist. "In my dreams, angels come and sleep with me at night," she answered. She then continued: Last night was my first time to see an angel; he was a man, and he said, "Do you know my name?" I said, "No." And he said, "My name is Isaac." He was a white man. He came down and said, "Let's go up." I said, "I'm afraid my faith isn't strong enough, and that God will reject me." He replied, "No, don't worry, let's go." We flew like birds without wings and came to a big door. The angel knocked on the door,1 and the Lord opened it, saying to the angel, "Come inside." The angel entered and asked the Lord, "May this woman come inside and see your house?" The Lord said, "All right, you call to her to come inside." The angel called me inside, and the Lord got a big book and put it on a table. He wrote and said to the angel, "Take her around so she can see inside my house." In the house I saw pictures of men and pretty flowers. The Lord is a very handsome young white man. After we went around, the Lord said to the angel, "Show her the book I'm writing in." I stood next to him. The Lord said to me, "I won't take everyone, only a few will come to me." He said the names of all the important men and women at Duranmin, Onai, Wani, Mandi, Diyos [all active in the church]; and said those whose names he hadn't called he will throw into the fire. Then he said, "That's all." The angel said, "I wanted to show you these things." The Lord said to the angel, "Take this woman back to her own place now." So the angel took me to the door and pushed me out, saying, "Go back." I protested, "We came a long way, how do I get back?" I then fell down, and I hit Semi, Walen's little girl who had come to sleep with me. She cried, and then I woke up. So this story the angel gave me. I thought, "I have to come tell you this." I dreamed it only last night. I had agreed to come and interview today, so this morning I dreamt a lot. This is the first time I had this kind of dream. Now this afternoon, I'll tell others this dream in church. Now that I've seen this I know the Lord is there and it's changed my belief a little. Having seen this, I think I must truly believe in this now. Narratives such as this one were told to me very frequently during the year-and-a-half of my fieldwork among the Asabano, in 1994-95. My re- search focused on religious change. I extensively interviewed virtually all adults and older children about their religious beliefs to document belief patterns remembered from precontact days, the conversion process, and current beliefs. I concentrated my inquiries on transmission patterns and on local forms of evidence invoked in accepting and rejecting beliefs. When I asked people to describe their religious beliefs and the reasons why they found them compelling, very often dreams were given as an explanation. As- abano attribute a high degree of experiential reality to the dream (aluma). Elders and missionaries assert the existence of certain mythological be- ings, and when Asabano, in turn, have dream encounters with these be- ings, it is easy for them to believe that they in fact exist: seeing is believing. Dreaming is, therefore, a catalyst for cultural transmission, providing per- sonal experiential verification of incoming information.</page><page sequence="3">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 77 To the Asabano, dreams represent the wanderings and adventures of one's disembodied soul. As real experiences, dreams are a valued source of information. Asabano describe dreams either as actual events directly witnessed, or as symbolic messages displayed by other beings. Dreamers learn characteristic forms of information from interactions with the dead, with benevolent forest beings, with malevolent place spirits, and with characters from recently introduced Christian mythology. The beings en- countered can impart knowledge to dreamers by telling them in words, or by showing them images. The use of dreams to communicate with powerful beings has not changed through the conversion to Baptist Christianity in the 1970s. In fact, dreams played a major role in the initial acceptance of Christianity, and remain important in the maintenance of faith, and in the encultura- tion of the next generation. In Asabano thinking, dream encounters with angels, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and God provide direct evidence for the existence and power of these supernatural beings. THEASABANO The Asabano are a small, ethnolinguistic group, numbering about 200.2 They are swiddeners and small-scale pig raisers, living on the fringe of the highlands of Papua New Guinea, at Duranmin in Sandaun Province. They are culturally part of the Mountain Ok or Min sphere,3 centered to the south at Telefomin, but linguistically are tied to the Sepik-Ramu lan- guage groups to the north.4 Asabano traditional religion revolved around male initiations into se- cret myths and magicoreligious practices that were marked by progressive presentations of formerly tabooed foods. Offerings for hunting and garden- ing success were made to wild humanlike beings called wobuno,5 and to ancestors, whose bones were kept in sacred houses or rock shelters. Vin- dictive spirits of stones, trees, and waters could be persuaded through of- ferings to cease causing sickness. Stephen (1995:131) observes that through understanding dream theories, local notions of self-its partitions, propensities, abilities, and place in the cosmos-are revealed. Indeed, my understanding of the As- abano conception of personal existence in life and death became clear only when I investigated ideas about sleep. According to traditional and contemporary Asabano religious belief, each person has two souls: the alomo kamalanedu (little soul), and the alomo kamayadu (big soul), each of which plays an important role in life, as well as after death. Sesi, a vivacious, hardworking young mother ex- plained what happens when a person is dreaming:</page><page sequence="4">78 0 ETHOS The big soul goes around at night and shows us good dreams while we are alive. When we sleep, the little soul watches the body, and the big one goes around. So dreams are what the big soul sees when it's travelling around. What we see in dreams will happen later. When I have a bad dream I wake up afraid, and then I pray and the Lord shows me a good dream. Analogously, at death the two souls part ways. The little soul remains a potentially dangerous presence at the gravesite, while the benevolent big soul travels to one of several villages of the dead, located in tabooed sec- tions of forest. Local beliefs have been influenced by a cascade of events in the past half century. During the 1940s, Asabano heard stories of the arrival of white people in nearby areas. Shortly afterward they heard aircraft over- head, and neighboring groups brought the first steel axes to trade. In about 1951, two men, Bledalo and Sumole, walked through the mountain passes to Telefomin, where the nearest government station had been established, and made first contact. The first official contact was made by an Australian colonial patrol to their territory in 1963 (Marks 1963). The Asabano were converted to Baptist Christianity by Papua New Guinean missionaries from Telefomin. The mission was lead by a well- educated and charismatic pastor named Diyos, who arrived in 1974. In 1977, a "revival" movement involving revelatory dreams, visions, and Holy Spirit possession began at the Asabano mission and Bible college at Duran- min, and soon spread throughout the region (Brumbaugh 1980:16-19; Brutti 1997; Gardner 1981:32-34; Hyndman 1994:131-142; Jorgensen 1981; Morren 1986:300-301; Robbins 1995; 1997a; 1997b; 1998. For a discussion of dreams in African churches, see Charsley 1992). As a conse- quence, traditional sacred houses and relics were destroyed, and virtually all Asabano embraced a charismatic form of Christianity. I argue that because individual Asabano often cited their dreams as sources of reliable supplementary information on newly learned religious matters, dreams played a significant part in their religious enculturation before, during, and after the conversion process. As such, dreams are a significant factor in cultural transmission-or more specifically, in cul- tural reception. ENCULTURATION AND CULTURAL TRANSMISSION A word of explanation is necessary regarding my generalized use of the terms enculturation and cultural transmission. Many of the religious beliefs that I describe moving between individuals initially came from a source external to Asabano society. Therefore, some readers could object to my use of the term enculturation to describe this process. Likewise, in some quarters transmission is used to refer only to cultural learning</page><page sequence="5">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 79 between generations, while diffusion is reserved for the horizontal move- ment of information. Indeed, all of these distinctions could be made in the examples that I present here. However, because I wish to emphasize a similar process common to all these variant forms, I use cultural trans- mission and enculturation for all cases of individuals adopting beliefs that are new to them. As Boyer (1994:22) has noted, the nature of cultural transmission is frequently glossed over rather than being explicitly considered in anthro- pology. That cultural learning happens is often taken for granted, and therefore the focus of interest becomes the source of the cultural informa- tion: insider or outsider, elder or junior. To be sure, a young mind that has not previously received cultural information faces somewhat different challenges than an older mind attempting to incorporate incongruous new ideas. However, the situations are similar enough to be grouped together for the purpose of demonstrating common underlying processes. It is also clear that beliefs transmitted from elders to juniors within a society have a different aura than beliefs diffusing to an individual in the acculturative process. Tradition may have connotations of legitimacy, venerability, and respectability (or old-fashioned insignificance) while beliefs exotic to one's parents may be laced with a sense of danger, excitement, and pro- gressivity (or absurdity and incomprehensibility). While distinguishing the sources of cultural information is necessary, my data indicate that for the Asabano, dreams served a similar catalytic role in accepting novel propositions, regardless of the source of those ideas. When I say cultural transmission, I mean the process of moving in- formation between any two individuals through social learning. By encul- turation, I mean learning how to think and behave according to whatever source is currently relevant and authoritative. Thus, cultural transmission leads to enculturation. DREAM PERCEPTION AND CULTURAL TRANSMISSION: PRODUCING FAITH It is widely known that dreams vary cross-culturally in the way they are experienced, in the imagery and symbolism that they contain, in their manner of disclosure and concealment, and in their interpretation and meanings.6 A number of authors that I refer to below have pointed out that in many societies dreams are attributed a special sense of reality. Under these circumstances dreams can also be a means of acquiring information, verifying dubious statements, and filling gaps left in messages from others. They are relevant in this regard in cultural exchanges both within and across societal boundaries. I wish to call attention to two generalized im- plications of these observations. First, as epistemological devices, dreams</page><page sequence="6">80 0 ETHOS act as catalysts in cultural transmission, in particular of religious beliefs. Under certain commonly occurring cultural conditions, namely the pres- ence of notions that dreams are in some way valid, real experiences, dreams have an especially great impact on the believability of religious ideas. The second implication is that in all likelihood, this fact may be easily overlooked by ethnographers, and is therefore underreported. As they are private experiences, dreams are not always shared. While they might be very important in enculturation, the people we study may not themselves outwardly emphasize this. If they do believe that dreams are important in social learning, they may not discuss this among themselves or with a researcher. Dreams are experiences hidden from public life; they become social only in the telling. The Asabano provide a good case in which to observe how dreams serve the process of cultural transmission because they do share their dreams widely, especially their religious dreams. Also, the Asabano believe that dreams are more than mere fan- tasy. Clearly, among the Asabano dreams are very important for the trans- mission of religious beliefs between individuals. Simply being told that something is true is often insufficient for the recipient of cultural informa- tion to believe. Some form of evidence or personal experience is usually required for transmission to be successful. Dreams provide Asabano with evidence for the factuality of religious statements because they provide a virtually tangible indication of truth, according to their epistemology. Asabano myths are always told on the premise that there is some piece of evidence for their veracity. Mythical episodes are considered likely to be true if the teller is somehow connected to the events described, or refers to external objects that figure in the story or came about as a result of the story's events. For example, stories of ancestral exploits were bolstered by displaying the bones of the protago- nist to wide-eyed boys in the initiation house. Genealogies that included ancestors who were not true human beings but enchanted animals or wobuno are backed up by pointing to living descendants. Many traditional stories are paired with songs, which are supposed to have been sung by protagonists in a distant time. The song itself is evidence that the story behind it is true. Since the introduction of Christianity, Asabano see the presence of physical Bibles as evidential of the truth of Christian myths. In these ways, Asabano listeners judge the veracity of the myths they are told. The common feature of all these examples is that to be believable, words must be backed up with sensory evidence to bring to mind some of the conditions of consciousness experienced by the myth's characters. In other words, listeners expect some kind of emulation of direct experience, allowing them to, in a sense, make the mythical scenarios real. In life, one</page><page sequence="7">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 81 knows one has encountered a supernatural being by, for example, seeing the figure of a person one knows to be dead walking in the forest. Lacking such apparently unambiguous indications, to take another example, one becomes certain a cannibal witch is nearby if one experiences spontane- ous feelings of fear or observes animals behaving unnaturally. Asabano consider all of these phenomena strong evidence, and trust the word of those who say they have experienced or witnessed such things because of the storyteller's physical connection with them. As Boyer (1994) has argued, religious ideas have qualities of intuitive unnaturalness in all cultures, which accounts for their fascination. For such accounts to be believable, stronger forms of evidence, as locally con- strued, are required. This is especially true for the primary transmission of beliefs that are exotic to the listener. Asabano frequently cite witnessing a dream in which mythological characters appeared as evidence for their existence. This same pattern has been documented in many other places, including among the Ilahita Arapesh. "In discussing aspects of ghost belief, Arapesh informants cite their appearance in dreams as evidence in support of certain standard ideas about them" (Tuzin 1975:566). In Tahiti, many dreams represent "the wanderings of one's own soul," and are "a window opening on the supernatural world" (Levy 1973:374-77). Among the Raramuri of Mexico, souls are believed to wander outside the body during dreams, where they can gather valuable cosmological information (Merrell 1988:60, 104-105). This understanding of dreams is so common cross-culturally that Stephen refers to it as "classic" (1979:5). Attributing varying degrees of reality to dream experiences (as opposed to writing them off as fantasy) is in fact more the rule than the exception among human societies. This way of perceiving dreaming is itself cultural information that needs to be transmitted before dreams can serve as catalysts for accepting other religious beliefs. This occurs when one hears a plausible explanation of what dreaming is from a reputable source, which colors one's perception and interpretation of subsequent dreams. The local system of dream inter- pretation, writes Tuzin, "appears to have an inordinately large part in con- structing the dream's manifest content. The individual is struck by the poignant accuracy of the diviner's interpretation, not realizing that the dream content was itself a partial artifact of his (the dreamer's) prior knowledge of the interpretational system" (1975:560-61). In the "classic" view, dreams are elevated sources of knowledge be- cause, as D'Andrade found in his survey of anthropological dream re- search, there is a persistent association found between dreams and beliefs about supernaturals, includ- ing other souls. Dreams have been shown to be one of the chief means of communica- tion with supernaturals, and supernaturals have been found to have certain similarities to figures which typically appear in dreams. [1961:298-91</page><page sequence="8">82 * ETHOS For this reason, and because in dreams one seems able to transcend boundaries of space, time, and death, dreams stand out as significant. Sha- mans in some native North American tribes, for example, gained otherwise inaccessible knowledge of healing magic through dream initiations at the hands of dead shamans (Eliade 1964:101-2; Kilborne 1981:173; Wallace 1947:252). In Melanesia, Wagner observes that among Daribi craftsmen, "real talent . .. can only represent something additional to ordinary effort, and must be obtained through a dream" (1972:74). In many cultural settings, dreams are considered a source of special knowledge and insight; a kind of inside information or wisdom on cosmo- logical, religious, and magical subjects that is not otherwise available. As Lindstrom has observed regarding Melanesia, "dreaming is a widespread means of inspiration that regulates the formulation of authentic knowl- edge.... Dreaming authorizes the production of truth. In dreams, people receive (that is, overhear or observe) knowledge from authoritative sources. Those who dream well thereby qualify themselves to talk seri- ously" (1990:87). Lindstrom makes the point here that the transmitter of cultural information, the talker, has greater credibility in Melanesian so- cieties if what he or she has to say derives from dream experiences. I would add the observation that, if the listener then also experiences a similar dream that validates what the speaker said, the information will be ac- cepted as proven by personal direct sensory evidence. This is especially true in the case of the transmission of assertions and beliefs for which ready physical evidence-that is, perceivable by the five senses in waking consciousness-is lacking. Much of the cultural content of religious tradi- tions is information of this nature. While dreams are private, they are always affected by incoming cul- tural information. Nevertheless, Lincoln draws a distinction between "in- dividual" and "culture pattern" dreams (1970 [19351:22-23). Kilborne (1981:170) rightly criticizes this dichotomy for its vagueness: indeed, such pure forms do not exist, and as ideal types they are misleading. As dreams affirm beliefs of external origin, they do so in ways that suit the idiosyn- cratic needs of individual dreamers. For example, Hollan demonstrates that among the Toraja, individuals develop personalized theories of dream experience and interpretation, allowing them to use dreams for their own psychological purposes (1989). All dreams are influenced by surrounding culture, and any cultural motif has its individual manifestations and vari- ations in the dreaming minds of persons. Culture resides, after all, in the minds of individuals, and in dreams, the expectations of others and the desires of the self are reconciled. The dream is among the most private and personal of human experi- ences. "No observer can directly share in another person's dream visions and sensations" (Stewart 1997:877). Yet, within this individual, experiential</page><page sequence="9">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea * 83 realm, socially important processes take place. Stewart points out the im- portance of the experiential aspect of dreams of myths. "Placing a story within the framework of dreaming ... grounds the narrative as the report of a direct, individual experience, and it simultaneously brackets the story as extraordinary knowledge (revelatory, transcendental) that demands a different appreciation from ordinary stories, whether factual or fictional" (1997:878). Direct experience provides the most compelling evidence for belief. Seeing a quality image, such as that in a dream, or even a video or photo- graph, can be powerful experiential evidence, especially among people only marginally familiar with the nature of such images. Seeing pictures or videos depicting characters from Christian mythology had a similar im- pact as dreams, but one much less powerful. A 16-year-old girl named Malina, for instance, said: We saw a picture of angels in a magazine. They were standing holding flowers, and they showed us a video at the Bible College, and we saw it. Jesus went to church and the angels followed him. I believed it because I saw the pictures. Magic lantern images of Jesus displayed by a missionary in Kgalagadi villages in Botswana had a similarly powerful impact on African converts (Landau 1994). The rhetorical power of direct witnessing combined with the mystical atmosphere of dreams as experiential, yet fantastic makes them a potent catalyst for the transmission and reception of religious cul- tural information. Dreams can display visual images corresponding to ideas expressed verbally by others, lending them greater credibility (Stewart 1997:885). Tuzin notes that among the Ilahita Arapesh, the visual imagery used in sermons had a powerful impact on dream content (Tuzin 1989:196). One message I frequently heard in church at Duranmin was that the way to heaven is hard, and only a few will have strong enough beliefs and good enough behavior to make it. It is frequently expressed with verbal imagery: "The road to Heaven is small, while that to the fire is wide and well-trav- eled." Some Asabano told me of dream experiences in which, by witness- ing this verbal description visually, they became convinced of its truth. Isaguo, a kind and deeply religious woman of about 50, described one such dream: Once I wanted to go to Sumwari, and the night before I left I saw a dream, and a man said, "The Holy Spirit is a witness of you." I came to a junction in the road, and the man said, "If you take the big road you will certainly go to Hell. If you see a cross and a small road, then you know that's the road to Heaven. If you take the small, narrow road it is very hard, hard work to find that road and follow it. If you don't work hard you won't get there." That's the dream. So I thought God showed me a very good dream. This was in 1988. I didn't tell everybody, just a few, I just thought about it. This was a challenge to me and I changed.</page><page sequence="10">84 * ETHOS By translating verbal messages from others into visual images wit- nessed by the soul, dreams serve the religious life by "clothing these con- ceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic" (Geertz 1973:90). TYPES OF SDAHO DREAMS MD THE INFORMATION THEY CONTAIN Asabano described dreams either as (1) actual events directly wit- nessed, or (2) as symbolic messages displayed by other beings. In each case dreams have a reality to them that many Westerners would find un- canny. They are also seen as bearing valuable information that can be exploited in waking life. Fugod, a powerfully built man in his fifties with a deep voice, de- scribed dreams he had of the first type: The Holy Spirit and angels exist. The men who can read in the Bible see them men- tioned, and I believe them. I myself had a dream, the Spirit of God appeared like a pigeon (madibenedu) and I thought, the Bible says the Holy Spirit is like a bird. I saw many birds: they were angels. Some had broken bones. In the Bible there are pictures of these birds, the Spirit of God can turn into them and fly. I thought I was awake, but it was a dream. When I woke up I remembered that Pastor Wani had told me that if you don't look after your spirit and your spirit has sins and burdens it will be bad, so I thought this must be what the dream referred to. I also dreamed of Hell, so I believe it must be true. I was walking on a path and red fire came behind me! I was surprised. I woke up, and thought God was showing me the fire of Hell. In this narrative, one can discern the place of dreaming in Asabano epistemology: the dream represents direct contact with and perception of reality. Fugod places emphasis on forms of reliable evidence that support his belief in the Holy Spirit and angels. Written references and pictures, which are understood to be a kind of residue of events in themselves, were seen in the Bible by people he knows. In this way a type of substantial connection was established between himself and the mythical beings. His dreams then visually confirmed what he had been told. They also bore certain valuable lessons, which come through in many of the Christian dreams I collected: human beings are living in a precarious relationship with God. While he offers fabulous rewards, his demands are high and difficult to understand. To fail to meet his demands invites a very unpleas- ant fate indeed: a fate that most people will ultimately fall into. Therefore, the dreamer is motivated to make renewed efforts at achieving a Christian lifestyle. Belok, a dependable and well-liked man in his mid-thirties, described dreams of the second, symbolic type: "When you dream and see a picture, sometimes it will come true. For me, when I dream of men cutting sago, a man will die. If I see women processing sago, a woman will die. So we think some dreams predict the future and others don't."</page><page sequence="11">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea * 85 People do not claim to always understand the symbolism of a given dream, which allows them to explain cases of dreams that seem nonsensi- cal or make false predictions. Belok explained that standard dream symbols are recognized and in- terpreted according to convention or individual experience. "If I dream of having sex with a woman or getting money from a man, I know the next day I'll kill animals," Belok said on another occasion. Asabano look for patterns in their dreams when something has happened. After the fact, they may notice having had certain types of dreams preceding the events, and can then formulate rules of dream symbolism. One day I told Wani, the local pastor, about a dream I had had the night before, in which my laptop computer was in the fire. I had interpreted this as simple anxiety about losing my hard-earned data, but he said that both before contact and today, dreams are often interpreted as showing what will happen in the future. He interpreted my dream much more literally than I did, and rec- ommended that I be careful a fire does not burn down my house. As foreigners and their things have appeared on the scene over the past half century, exotic beings have also come to populate Asabano dreams. Their visitations upon sleeper's souls enlighten dreamers on vari- ous concerns ranging from the age-old need for hunting success to new worries on how to attain salvation in Heaven. Local dream theory itself has not altered significantly in this process. However, there have been some shifts in the kinds of information that dreamers receive. I will presently demonstrate this by describing the beings that Asabano dreamers encoun- tered before contact in the mid-20th century, the role of dreams in the conversion of the 1970s, and dream themes at the time of my fieldwork in 1994-95. Asabano dreamers learn different forms of information, depend- ing on what type of being they encounter. Not all of the example dreams occurred during the periods I seek to describe, but each illustrates char- acteristics of the time's genre. Traditional Dreaming Before any Western influences presented themselves to the Asabano, the task of religious transmission from generation to generation was aided by receivers' dream experiences. Consider how Sansib, a literate woman in her thirties, describes her coming to believe that the dead truly appear in dreams: I heard my father tell stories that if you walk alone or when you sleep souls of the dead will scare you or chase you. That's all I heard, and I believed it because sometimes at night I would wake up and feel afraid, and I would remember what he said. I have seen spirits of the dead in dreams. Last night I was praying. I closed my eyes and prayed because Walen [my husband] is sick, and I saw Sgane [an old woman who recently died] come in all wrapped in a sheet with only her face exposed, and she went to play with Walen, saying "Walen, are you sick?" as he was sleeping. I was surprised and</page><page sequence="12">86 * ETHOS opened my eyes, and she wasn't there! I feel it's true, her spirit must have come near. I was afraid-I'm not used to seeing this kind of thing. In this case, Sansib's father told her that the dead visit in dreams, and she was willing to truly believe it because she saw the dead in her dreams, and remembered her father's words regarding how to interpret this appear- ance. This is much like the process of interpretive drift, which Luhrmann describes among Londoners who are drawn to witchcraft. These individu- als come to believe in magic through changing their habits of perception and interpretation based on principles taught by leaders (1989). According to older Asabano informants, during the years before con- tact and missionization, religious dreams were populated by the dead; be- nevolent wobuno; and malevolent tree, stone, and water spirits. Each imparted their own characteristic forms of data, so to speak. In addition to verifying religious beliefs received from others, they were a valued source of information on hunting, defense, and life after death. Messages of Doom from the Dead Traditionally, seeing the dead in a dream was a bad omen-an indi- cation that they were near, and perhaps preparing to claim some of the living. Belok described a dream in which he saw what the dead were up to. This suggested an impending death. On Saturday I saw a dream of my mother [Sganel before she died, and her dead cousins Aisoibi and Pita. They came to perform a drum dance and put on the wosaw [big feather headdress]. While I was dreaming I thought, "I think she's about to die, and her dead relatives are happy to get her so they're singing and dancing." I told my father, and then on Sunday night at 12:00 she died, so I thought it was true. If I dream of a drum dance, it means someone will die. The first time I heard of this was when my father Bledalo told me, "If you see a dead man, or the dead show you a drum dance, someone will die." I believed it, because he said it and I saw it come true. Pigs and Cassowariesfrom the Wobuno Before contact, Asabano had regular dealings with wobuno to secure hunting success. Then and now, people believe that the wild areas of the forest are filled with numerous wobuno, which are generally benevolent anthropomorphic beings who possess fabulous powers. Wobuno are be- lieved to look after wild pigs, and therefore successful hunts were preceded by making offerings and entreaties to wobuno in a kind of trading relation- ship. Wobuno encountered in dreams told where to find game in response to an offering. One day I asked Yalowad, a respected former tultul, or Australian colonial village headman, if he used to believe in wobuno, and why he believed. "Yes," he answered, and continued:</page><page sequence="13">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea * 87 They certainly exist, even now. My uncles told me they are in the bush. They are just like us: they have houses and villages, but we don't see them. They are in the forest and gave us meat. The ancestors and fathers told us, and I think it's true. When the Holy Spirit hadn't come down yet [during the Christian revival], I used to dream of them when I was in the forest. They would tell me, "You go to this place and I'll give you meat." Then I'd go and it was true. Yakob village, where I lived, is named after a certain stone brought from the Kienu River area when the Asabano moved to their present loca- tion in 1972. This stone has a wobudu7 inside. Its shape is reminiscent of the neck and head of a brontosaurus, about 0.3 meters tall. "Our ancestors said that he will help with hunting if you give him presents of tobacco, sago, and so on," Sumole, a warm, middle-aged father told me. Women made offerings to him as well as men. He works by appearing in a dream as a man-I have dreamt of him often-and he tells the dreamer where to go hunting.8 And it works! If you go there you'll see animals. Yakob appears while hunting as a cassowary who plays with you-no matter how many arrows you shoot, you won't be able to hit him. The offerings left for Yakob didn't just rot there-they disappeared. Unlike the undesirable dreams of the dead, which bore frightening portents, hunters actively sought dream encounters with wobuno as a method of obtaining fat game. Sumole said the wobuno also identified ma- levolent beings responsible for sickness. "We saw wobuno in dreams, and they would tell us which nambeno (tree spirits) were harming a particular person." The Antics of Malevolent Beings At mid-century, as today, Asabano felt vulnerable to the heartless whim of a host of malevolent beings, which they believed to be responsible for almost all deaths. Lurking in the forest, nambeno (tree spirits), kabiambeno (stone spirits) and nomombeno (water spirits) could capture the soul of a passerby, resulting in sickness or death. Though negatively disposed toward people, traditionally these demons could be dealt with economically through offerings when they had made a person sick. Ene- mies from within also threatened. Sanemono (cannibal witches) and the little souls of the dead were less controllable and greatly feared. When people became ill, they tried to recall where they had been in the recent past when they first became afraid or felt ill. This provided a clue as to which being was responsible for their condition, and what must be done. Dreamers could also obtain information about the source of ill- nesses by witnessing the attack. If a dreamer saw that a tree, stone, or water spirit was responsible, they made a magico-economic exchange with it. It was vital to know the offending spirit's gender, for, as Omahu, an elderly Towale man living with the Asabano (the two groups are close and intermarry freely), explained, "The Asabano and Towale had the same custom. If a female spirit was causing the trouble, the women had to deal</page><page sequence="14">88 * ETHOS with it; if a male spirit was doing it, the men had to. They found out the sex by seeing a dream." "People used to dream that a tree spirit or other thing had hurt a certain man, so when we had these dreams we would know," Yalowad said. "I also had dreams about the nambeno. The nambeno have white skin. The nambeno can also give you animals. I have also dreamed when someone was sick that the nambeno made him sick." When cannibal witches were identified, they were killed. Informants told me of several executions that took place. Dying people sometimes named their killers, leading survivors to seek additional evidence to sup- port the accusations. If the accused behaved suspiciously, was known to have had a quarrel with the deceased, and especially if others were dying in his or her sphere, suspicions were confirmed. Dreams depicting the suspected witch's deed constituted strong evidence of guilt. A pious young woman named Maria told me she witnessed in a dream how cannibal witches had killed an older man. "I dreamed that witches killed Abueli," she said. Before he died he told me he had visited a certain place where witches got him. I dreamed two men followed the river. We always heard stories that witches like to hide in rivers. The grandfather wanted to harvest sweet potatoes and they shot him in the chest with a bamboo-tipped arrow. If you get shot like that you'll die in a hurry. I dreamt this when he was sick, before he died. In precontact times, if such a dream revealed the identity of the "witches," and if there was further substantiating evidence, those bereaved would execute the accused. It must be noted that by giving substance to circulating thoughts and suspicions, dreams frequently lent a sense of certainty to otherwise vague suspicions of witchcraft. In this way, dreams enhanced fragmentary obser- vations and incomplete or even half-baked ideas by solidifying them into a virtually tangible form of evidence. Recurrent propositions that certain individuals were witches were in fact very specific religious beliefs. Like more general beliefs taught by elders or imported from exotic sources, they needed to be substantiated with an acceptable form of evidence. Dreaming and the Conversion to Christianity In his study of Madang area cargo cults, Burridge (1960:28) demon- strated that dreams can serve as a basis for altering religious convictions in the face of foreign influences. The founders of these movements dreamt ritual solutions to the problem of unmet desires to share in Western wealth. The appealing idea that Melanesians could magically gain access to cargo was a religious suspicion that lacked sufficient evidence to be believed with conviction. Leaders' dream images echoed the suspicions that were on peoples' minds, but recast them as factual apprehensions.</page><page sequence="15">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 89 With the introduction of Christianity to the Asabano, dreams oper- ated similarly, but backed up the missionary's message, rather than incit- ing a counter movement. Conversion dreams expressed and solidified religious suspicions, based on fragmentary evidence, that Christianity was true. In 1974, the missionary Diyos followed what he believed to be God's command to leave his home in Telefomin and set up a mission and Bible college at Duranmin, several days' walk away. He has published an account of his visions and his mission (Wapnok 1990). Having heard of a revival movement in the Solomon Islands from one of his classmates, he hoped to preside over a revival of his own. In his visions he felt that God offered cryptic indications that this would indeed happen. Toward that end he concentrated prayer, sermons, and the work of organizing the construc- tion of an airstrip and college buildings. The Asabano people welcomed his efforts and were intrigued by his promises of a heaven where there is plenty of food and European-style houses. Some were concerned, however. Older initiated men were espe- cially cautious of abandoning their traditional practices, which ensured garden fertility and success in hunting. To allay their fears, converts set out to procure evidence by planting experimental gardens. During prepa- rations, they ignored traditional religious procedures, but offered fervent prayers to Jesus. Some old men feared the worst, that this blasphemy would render their gardens forever barren, but the Christian gardens were exceptionally productive, and the mission cleared a major hurdle. By 1977, many Asabano had accepted Christianity in theory, but also continued to practice traditional religion. At this point, the revival that Diyos had been praying for occurred, spurred on by the prophetic dream of one of his Bible college students from Mianmin. The dream indicated that the time was nigh. As Diyos preached with great power one evening, many people fell to the ground, spoke in tongues, and saw visions of the Holy Spirit, Jesus, angels, and other characters from Christian mythology. This experience was profoundly convincing to many who had doubted. In the months that followed, a few women experienced possession by the Holy Spirit, known as sirit wk (spirit work). During these episodes, or afterwards in dreams, they received messages regarding the activities of local "sinners," including men who were continuing to practice traditional religion. Their apparently divinely inspired admonitions resulted in tre- mendous social pressure to abandon indigenous religious institutions. These were very exciting times, and the obvious and dramatic events of the day were taken as clear evidence of a greater power, but making the internal adjustment to the new way of thinking required more personal- ized evidence. Just as the visions of those who collapsed during that fateful sermon precipitated a cascade of acceptance, dreams convinced the rank</page><page sequence="16">90 0 ETHOS and file of the literal truth of the new religion. Dreamers actually saw God, the Holy Spirit, Jesus, and angels; they heard messages, witnessed scenar- ios, and visited Heaven. The deities issued warnings of Hell and reminders to believe and behave in order to receive what is needed in life and secure a place in paradise after death. Smiling broadly, Wosono, an easy-going older woman, told how she flew to Heaven in a dream: God's talk is true. I am a woman who likes to chew betelnut and smoke, but when Diyos preached, I started spirit work and I left all these old ways. Diyos and Wani talked, and my spirit also talked. The Holy Spirit told me, "Whatever custom your father taught you, it was a lie. You must follow God's word." He showed me in a dream-it was his thoughts, not mine. I was asleep and I saw fire, and heard it said, "If you are stubborn you will go to the fire." I saw the ocean, and he said, "On the last day the ocean will come and cover everyone. If you believe you will turn into birds and fly to Heaven." I was afraid and so I left my old customs. I saw this after the revival. Then a second time I dreamt the earth was changing, and I wanted to run away, but I turned into a butterfly and flew up. Then I was happy and clapped my hands. I thought it was real, but then I woke up. After this, I just wanted to think about the new things and the Bible all the time. It is significant that Wosono is shown bits of physical evidence to accompany the Christian assertions in her dream. She sees the fire of Hell and an apocalyptic deluge with her own eyes. Living in the interior of New Guinea, the Asabano only discovered the ocean's existence in 1963, when a group of men were sent to the coast to stand trial for involvement in a tribal fight. The limitless water they described upon their return must have been a powerful and threatening image. Asabano face the vast and incom- prehensible dangers of the outside world by relying on the Christian god: a similarly expansive power that comes from that same world. Wosono's dreams, typical of Asabano conversion dreams, incorporated the new into her imagination of reality-the last day and Heaven became real, and therefore believable. Men's fears were relieved when, having abandoned traditional food taboos and codes of mythical secrecy, hunting and gardening remained successful. Though they abandoned their relationships with wobuno, their dreams confirmed the missionary's rhetoric that God made everything, and prayers to him would bear results. Men sought answers to prayers for a good hunt in dreams. In that realm, encounters with the Holy Spirit served the same purposes and provided the same kinds of information as was formerly provided by wobuno and nambeno. Like the wobuno, Christian beings directed hunters where to search for animals and provided meat in response to entreaty. Like many men, Onai, a church leader in his late thirties, had a hunting dream to share: At the time of the revival in 1977, for the first time I went to the forest and prayed. I said, "God, you made everything; the Bible says if you pray you'll give to us." Then I slept and dreamt. In the dream, I went to the forest with Sinea. We slept, and the next</page><page sequence="17">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 91 day I killed a young pig. He killed a young cassowary and a big pig. The next morning I told him my dream. We went to the bush, and I killed a pig, and he killed a pig and a cassowary, just like in the dream. So I know God is truly there and gave me these things. Just as the Asabano turned traditional dream practices to the task of learning about and from the Holy Spirit, the Christianized Foi, observed by James Weiner, adapted traditional fasting and dreaming to communi- cate with spirits in the new religion. "The local Foi representatives of the Christian mission have used the dream quest in their search for divine revelation" (Weiner 1986:122). A number of authors have written on dreaming and its role in the incorporation of new cultural material. A brief digression into this litera- ture demonstrates that this principle is frequently important to under- standing religious transmission. Religiously acculturative situations are highly stressful, as long-held beliefs and attitudes face startling challenges. What Watson and Watson- Franke described for Guajiro women facing a stressful adjustment to urban life holds true for Asabano considering conversion as well. "The dream is a particularly significant guide to action and hence a potential solution to a problem for the very reason that the message it contains is a command issued by a higher authority and therefore compulsive in its effects on behavior" (1977:396). Stephen has also commented on the importance of dreams through periods of rapid social change, as illustrated by the Mekeo, whose attitude toward dreams is very similar to that of the Asabano. Reminiscent of Wosono's dream is Stephen's description of a Mekeo man who saw Heaven and Hell, in a dream tour given by his dead father. "This dream experience convinced the dreamer that the mission's teachings concerning the fate of the soul in the after life were indeed true" (Stephen 1982:112). Even when people are already convinced of the truth of what mission- aries are saying, in the face of confusion over newly introduced religious beliefs, dreams help clarify the details in the minds of the converts. In his discussion of the role of dreaming in medieval Muslim culture, Grunebaum points out that "Dreams elucidate theological doctrine" and that "Dreams that clarify the position of the deceased in the Hereafter at the same time frequently instruct on the correct solution of controversial theological is- sues" (1966:14-15). Clearly dreams can serve to incorporate the incongruencies of Euro- pean-derived culture with Melanesian understandings. As I alluded above, Burridge shows how dreams speak to contemporary, local concerns but are shrouded in an air of revelation. By sharing these oneiric clarifications with others, dreamers can have great impact on their society because of the resonance of the dream's message with people's deepest, half-articu- lated suspicions (Burridge 1960:28).</page><page sequence="18">92 0 ETHOS Not only widely shared social factors are involved in the content of religiously transforming dreams. Tuzin demonstrates how factors of indi- vidual psychological makeup combine in the making of religious dreams and visions. He effectively argues that dependency needs and guilt feelings shaped a dream-like conversion experience that thrust a relatively ineffec- tual Christian man into a leadership position in the revival movement of the Ilahita Arapesh (1989). Imagery associated with exogenous Christian- ity and its bearers were important components in the manifest content. Tuzin further develops this discussion of dreams in relationship to desire, expectation, and myth in his recent book (1997). Dreams were a significant source of knowledge in the Ilahita revival as well. Attending charismatic services well past midnight, revivalists' dreams had remark- ably similar content. [TJhe people took [this] as proof that they were all glimpsing the same spiritual reality, [but this] was in fact the predictable consequence of the feverish reporting and com- paring of visionary experiences among members of the Revival community. They were indeed drawing from a common reality, but it was a reality that existed neither "out there" nor "in there," in some profound spiritual sense: it was a reality emergent from the intense, even obsessional communicating and mutual emulating of personal fanta- sies within the tightly knit community of believers. [Tuzin 1997:151] No doubt, even in societies lacking classic dream beliefs, intense re- ligious movements are bound to produce a spate of similar dreams. In such situations, it is very tempting for believers to find the co-occurrence more than coincidental. Where classic dream beliefs are current, the phenome- non of numerous people having similar dreams emulates group verifica- tion of an event seen by many witnesses in waking life. Under these circumstances, acceptance of the belief is even more certain. Tuzin's observations of the role of dreams in the Ilahita revival serve also to illuminate the situation during the 1977 revival at Duranmin. The experience of similar dreams and visions by numerous people provided not only personally satisfying evidence and need fulfillment, it also pro- vided a strong sense of verification through common experience. For As- abano converts, dream encounters with angels, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and God provided direct evidence for their existence and power. Religious Dream Evidence of the 1990s I arrived in the field 20 years after Diyos began his mission among the Asabano. I was very impressed with the seriousness and frequency of Christian worship, with prayer meetings at sunrise and sunset of every day, and long services on Sundays. However, it gradually became clear to me that people had suffered a declining religious enthusiasm, and that they were concerned about this. People cited continued deaths and witch- craft suspicions as responsible for the vague spiritual malaise. They were</page><page sequence="19">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 93 also regretful that a scandal had resulted in the removal of the Bible college to another area shortly before I arrived. The college put Duranmin on the map of modern Papua New Guinea, and though very few Asabano had studied or graduated at their local school they were very proud of hosting it. While this was the situation at the time of my work there, I was none- theless certain that Christianity was firmly planted in the hearts and minds of these people. Any undertaking called for a prayer, and Christian concepts thoroughly colored their descriptions of the world, their past, and their future. In the Christian dream world, the dead, while still potentially threat- ening, often visited to reassure the bereaved that they were in Heaven. The wobuno were banished to the forest, but the Holy Spirit behaved very simi- larly to them and was able to fill their role in Asabano dreams. Malevolent nature spirits and cannibal witches remained a threat, to put it mildly, and have been re-envisioned as unambiguously aligned with Satan. Christian spirit work is engaged against these monsters as people wait for the last day. After praying over a sick person, dreams credited to the Holy Spirit often reveal the source of their illness. Rather than seeking to bargain with the offending spirit, or kill the offending witch, women and men offer pra- yers of redoubled fervor for their own protection and for witches to desist and repent. Warnings and Messages of Hope from the Dead A bright-eyed young man named Folen told me what kind of informa- tion dreamers received from the dead: I heard that the dead come and talk in dreams. Sianso [a young mother] at Daksil village told us she dreamt of her little son who had just died. He appeared to his mother in her dream, and said, "If father comes, tell him that his suspicion that I died from cannibal witchcraft isn't true-I just died." He was talking about the fact that there is a man who Salowa wanted Solsi to marry, but she didn't want to. So both men were mad about this, and then Salowa's boy died, so Salowa thought there might be a con- nection. In this example, the dead child is perceived to diffuse a conflict-de- rived witchcraft suspicion. Before colonial pacification in 1963, a conflict like this could easily have led to feuding or warfare. Execution of witches is no longer carried out, because of the Christian rhetoric that taking vengeance endangers salvation, and should be left to God. In this dream, the spirit of the deceased behaved in a very Christian manner, diffusing the danger of vengeful feelings. This is a striking contrast to the traditional practice, in which the dying named their supposed killers. The dream smoothly reaffirmed the still-new Christian ideas in a time of tragedy, when old patterns can surface.</page><page sequence="20">94 0 ETHOS "Sianso then had a second dream," Folen went on, "in which her dead son said, 'There is water on my grave. You must come dig a ditch around it.' But they didn't dig a ditch: they just built a house on top." Asabano formerly disposed of the dead on exposure platforms and collected the bones for use in offerings and magic. The custom of burial, mandated by the government, is accepted as a good way of handling corpses now that their bones are no longer needed. It is certainly possible that discomfort over the idea of a body in the muddy soil could have in- spired Sianso's second dream. Before the arrival of Christianity, to be approached by a ghost in a dream would have been interpreted as at least dangerous, and quite pos- sibly a death sentence. Asabano still speak of this possibility, reasoning that like the living, the dead are also bereaved by the separation from their loved ones. They are capable of capturing the spirit of a living person, resulting in sickness and death. In spite of this, a new genre of dreams of the dead has appeared. In Christian dreams of the dead, the deceased approaches the dreamer to provide solace and assurances that Heaven exists and they will one day be reunited. Kanau, a thin, middle-aged man, told me, between puffs on his cigarette, the power that such a dream had for him: If you see a dead person in a dream, you know she is alright. And she can talk to you and give you advice. She can say, "I'm alive, in the hand of the Lord and well, so you look after your children." I had a dream of my late wife Fodimin. She told me, "You mustn't worry or think a lot or be sad. You must look after the children and relax. You see my body and think that I'm dead, but I'm alive with God. You mustn't worry about death. God made a contract with us, and there's only one road, and we will meet again in Heaven." I slept and saw her face and she was with me and told me these things. When I got up, I was happy, and thought, "If I believe, later I'll see her again." When she died I didn't sleep, I just cried and worried. She died in June last year [1993], and I buried her, and in November I had the dream. I thought about her a lot; she looked after everyone, and we had always talked together. She said in the dream, "I haven't died and left you, I'm walking with you. You have to talk with God and believe, and look after our five children. When our children have grown up, you will come here. We will meet in Paradise. I came here and have a good house, good food, and a good village. The place where we were on Earth is no good-it's just a contract. Our true place is here." I thought, "Diyos's telling us about all this was true." Later, at the end of time when Jesus comes down, all of us who believe will go to Heaven, and those who don't will be lost and go to the fire. Then I talked with Wani and Diyos, who read the Bible, and I thought, "It's true." When I dreamt of my wife, I saw her skin was good and pretty, and she spoke clearly, so she must be alright. I had thought she died and I won't be able to see her, but then I saw her, so I thought, "It's only her body that's lost, she herself is still alive and well." I believe I saw her in the dream, and she said, "I'm here, I just left my body." Several people told me dreams similar to Kanau's. In addition to pro- viding comfort and hope, these and other Christian dreams also carry a</page><page sequence="21">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 95 warning: the comfortable afterlife is reachable, but easily lost. One must continue to follow God very carefully, for a few careless steps can land one in the fires of Hell. Pastors' descriptions of myth and dogma found in the Pidgin Bible can be difficult for their congregations to imagine. Dreams of the dead provide further information about the nature of God and the afterlife, and what one must do to maintain a good relationship with Jesus. Dreams of Wobuno The church forbids continued interaction with wobuno and labels them as "Satan's line." My impression is that virtually all Asabano obey this rule, and no longer make offerings to wobuno or expect them to pro- vide information through dreams because Christian mythological beings can serve the same purposes and require no offerings. However, Asabano attitudes toward the wobuno are currently mixed and ambivalent because their encounters with them were generally beneficial. While many young- sters describe them as demons, Bledalo, who is the oldest of the Asabano, feels they must be angels. One cannot, of course, forbid someone to dream of a particular person or thing, and no one at Duranmin is denying that the wobuno exist; they continue to hide in the forest and can be glimpsed when walking or dream- ing. "Some are white, some are black, and some of the women wear grass skirts," Yalowad said. "We didn't see white ones until the white people came." Yalowad told me the wobudu Yakob is his ancestor, and he has seen him in dreams many times. He named his daughter Omsimin after Yakob's daughter. He not only helped with hunting, but with looking after pigs and gardening as well. "The wobudu is still there. He appears in dreams or when walking in the forest. The Holy Spirit behaves similarly. He appears as a man, sometimes white, sometimes black; in many forms, in dreams or while walking. I myself have seen the Holy Spirit." It seems clear from this description that some older men use the behavior of wobuno as a model for interacting with the Holy Spirit. Dreams can, in this way, graft exogenous religious concepts onto living cosmologies, leaving only a thin scar. Judging by the attitudes of younger people, however, it seems likely that within a generation, wobuno will be completely banished to the forest, branded, without reservations, as demons. Dreams of the Holy Spirit and Malevolent Beings At the time of my fieldwork, concerns with evil spirits and cannibal witches remained a major concern. Sickness and death are believed to result from their activities, and they must be confronted, but now people do this by praying for God's intercession. In a dream or vision the Holy Spirit reveals the evil spirit's identity. The people then prepare a cross</page><page sequence="22">96 0 ETHOS bearing a Bible verse, carry it to the site where the offending spirits live, and plant the cross there, blocking their path. Omahu said: The people will do spirit work to get a vision or dream and say where to plant a cross. We don't kill pigs anymore, but it's the same kind of thing. Now they will get good food, tinned fish and rice, and pray, eat, feel happy, and plant a cross: and the person will get better. It's just like before. It was during a spirit working session that Mandi, Diyos' wife and fel- low missionary to the Asabano, received the method of planting crosses to close the path taken by malevolent spirits. This method, while accepting as fact that such beings are responsible for illness, provides a means of controlling them without dealing with them directly. They believe that in effect, Jesus stands where the cross is placed, protecting his believers from the lurking spirit. Dreams are closely associated with spirit work, and often follow prayer sessions, providing information that allows appropriate action to be taken. Young people grow up seeing this use of dreaming, and when they have Christian dreams themselves, they accept the messages the dreams contain. DREAMING AND THE ENCULTURATION OF NATIVES AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS In cultures that embrace the classic belief that dreams are true expe- riences of the soul, evidence from dreams can be a necessary factor in the cultural transmission of religious beliefs that lack direct physical percep- tive verification. Even in stable societies where foreign ideas scarcely in- trude, dreams work to establish as fact the strange ideas about supernatural beings that adults teach children. Though children are rela- tively credulous in their primary religious enculturation, religious ideas, no doubt, become more real to them through their dream experiences. For example, Lonika, a girl of 12, told me a frightening dream she had, which convinced her that the adults' stories about evil spirits were true. In her dream, while washing clothes with her mother, a stone spirit grabbed her by the neck and pulled her under water. She struggled with it and was able to escape. In Western societies, a parent might comfort the child by deny- ing the nightmare's reality: "It was just a dream." Asabano parents would have a different reaction, which would tend to reinforce the interpretation that the dream provided reliable intelligence about a spiritually dangerous environment. Dreaming as an influence on primary enculturation is substantial and yet easy to underestimate. Its role in secondary transmissions or accultu- rative situations is perhaps even greater. As I have shown, the relatively</page><page sequence="23">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 97 sudden and complete Asabano conversion to Christianity was greatly fa- cilitated by dreaming. Without some kind of direct, personal experience with strange new deities, the words of missionaries may seem to be little more than inter- esting stories. The incongruity of their myths with local assumptions is a major challenge missionaries face in trying to transmit their religions. Anthropologists at times face similar problems. How many ethnogra- phers, trying to dispel odd ideas circulating about them, meet with doubt or even a condescending glance? To take one example, Lepowsky was at pains to convince older Vanatinai Islanders that she was not the ghost of a woman who had recently died (1993:25). Some Asabano were convinced that I had an underground road to America, which explained my plentiful supply of food. We deny that such things are true; to us they are not only wrong, they are ridiculous-as is the nature of religious beliefs that are not our own. In just the same way, people from other backgrounds find our denials and explanations absurd. Religious beliefs are hard to transmit, especially across cultural boundaries, when an entire cosmological system must be altered to ac- commodate ideas that do not fit. Dreams provide a venue in which these adjustments can be made. Indeed it is possible that without the influence of dreams, it would not have been possible for the Asabano to absorb and internalize exotic Christian beliefs. Dreams play a causal role in cultural transmission and enculturation that can be easily overlooked. Even in societies in which dreams are believed to be fantasies, they are personal, emotionally powerful, and perceived as happening to the dreamer rather than created by the dreamer through the "autonomous imagination" (Stephen 1989). They are important in establishing a com- fort level when new cultural information is flowing in from others. Dreams make foreign information our own. "Beliefs," as Stephen writes, "are not something simply imprinted upon the individual by his society and ac- cepted without question, but rather. . . each man and woman, through the creative process of his or her own dreaming, constructs a private symbolic universe" (1989:120). In his famous essay "Grief and a Headhunter's Rage," Rosaldo (1993) vividly underscored the importance of personal emotional experience in understanding the explanations of our informants. It is often said that flu- ency is nigh when one begins to dream in a foreign language one is learn- ing. Likewise, when one begins to experience dreams in a way that is current in the foreign culture that one is studying, it is a milestone in understanding (Luhrmann 1989:80). Ethnographers are professionally engaged in the business of cultural transmission, so it is only to be expected that our-own dreams reflect the enculturation (or acculturation?) we receive among our hosts (Tedlock</page><page sequence="24">98 0 ETHOS 1994:288-290). One night, under my mosquito net and to the accompa- nying din of thousands of forest insects, I dreamt that my sister Sue had just died and we were burying her. (In fact she was accidentally shot and killed in 1971, when I was a child). In my dream, though, I was grown up. Sue's ghost was appearing and harassing me. When I woke up shortly be- fore dawn, I found myself cowering under the blanket for fear that a mali- cious ghost should really appear. I thought to myself, "I don't believe in ghosts! " Still, in the darkness I felt afraid and ready in case a ghost actually materialized. I had come to think, if only for a moment, as Asabano do about the dangerous little soul that hovers about the grave. This made me think a lot about belief. No matter what our waking sensibilities may tell us, seeing is believing. ROGER IVAR LOHMANN is a doctoral candidate in anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. NOTES Acknowledgments. My primary period of fieldwork in 1994-95 was made possible by a generous Fulbright grant. I wish mainly to thank those dreamers at Duranmin who contrib- uted their words for this article. Eytan Bercovitch kindly shared his fieldnotes and photo- graphs with me from a brief visit he made to the Asabano in 1982. I am grateful to Joel Robbins who encouraged me to write about dreams for his session on Charismatic and Pen- tecostal Christianity in Oceania at the 1998 meeting of the Association for Social Anthropol- ogy in Oceania. The result is this essay, which was greatly strengthened by helpful comments from the session participants and observers, especially John Barker, Fred Er- rington, Deborah Gewertz, Maurice Godelier, Pamela Stewart, and Andrew Strathern. I pre- sented an informal version of this paper at the Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Maria Lepowsky and Ted Mayer offered particularly valuable sug- gestions. I wish to acknowledge Kirin Narayan's wonderful influence on my writing style. My thanks to Anne Lewinson, Joel Stocker, and Don Wesolowski for reading and commenting on a draft of the manuscript. Bob Tonkinson, Donald Tuzin, and an anonymous reviewer offered very valuable advice, which I have followed to the best of my ability. 1. Knocking on doors is not an indigenous practice-one simply enters, perhaps speaking a greeting before crossing the threshold. 2. Bercovitch (1982) collected preliminary information on Asabano mythology in con- junction with his fieldwork among the neighboring Atbalmin (1989). MacKenzie (1991) also made a brief visit to Duranmin as part of her research on Telefol net bags. 3. The Min group of cultures are united by their common descent (culturally or physi- cally) from an "Old Woman" known in Telefol as Afek and, in Asaba, as Semodu, who is said to have wandered through the area (Craig and Hyndman 1990). Mountain Ok and Min are alternate terms for the group of culturally similar societies found in this region. The former term was coined by Healey to refer to a number of related languages in which the term ok means water (Healey 1964). Min is used locally, from the Telefol, for "People." (See Jorgen- sen 1996.) 4. Asaba amole, or "Asabano talk," has been mentioned by the Telefol designation Duranmin in the linguistics literature (Wurm 1982:218-219). 5. Asaba terms are italicized, while Melanesian Pidgin terms are underlined.</page><page sequence="25">The Role of Dreams among the Asabano of Papua New Guinea 0 99 6. For a recent review of the history of anthropological wrangling with the dream, see Tedlock 1994. 7. Wobudu is singular, while wobuno is plural or collective. 8. An interesting comparison can be made with the role of dreaming for Rock Cree hunt- ers in Manitoba. Here, one's "dream image," a kind of spirit helper in the form of an animal or any other object, "may be talked about as essential to foraging success, communicating with its human dependent in dreams, facilitating dreams about individual animals, serving as a conduit for information about animal numbers and movements, and imparting 'power' deployed in hunting" (Brightman 1993:77).
