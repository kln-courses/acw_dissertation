MAZRUI* As the European colonial period was coming to an end in the 1950s, calculations were made about the balance of religious forces in the African continent. In the year of Ghana's independence (1957) the Paris Academy of Political and Moral Sciences received some perti- nent estimates. The Academy was informed that between the years 1940 and 1946 the annual increase of professing Muslims in the French African colonies was nearly a quarter of a million every year. Between 1931 and 1951 Muslims in the whole of Africa had risen from 40 million to 80 million in comparison with a Roman Catholic rise of from 5 million to 15 million. Of the total black population estimated at the time as being 130 million in Africa south of the Sahara, 28 million were Muslim, 30 million were Catholics, 4 million were Protestants and 85 million still followed primarily their own traditional indigenous religions. Islam in Africa as a whole, including Arab Africa, commanded the allegiance of approximately 40 per cent of the continent's population. ISLAM: REGIONAL DIFFERENCES Islam had entered the continent quite early in the Hijra (Islamic) era. The Arab conquerors snatched away Egypt from the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century within a few years of the Prophet Muham- mad's death. We can certainly say that the Islamization of North Africa took place primarily through political means (conquest, control and suzerainty). On the other hand, Islamization in Black Africa has tended to occur primarily through economic means (trade and economic migra- tion). Islam came to Black West Africa on horseback across the Sahara, *Research Professor at the University of Jos (Nigeria) and Professor of AfroAmerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan, Dr. Mazrui presented this paper as a 75th Anniversary Lecture at the 1984 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Religion.</page><page sequence="2">818 Journal of the American Academy of Religion mainly as part of economic traffic between the northern societies of the continent and the western. Islam came to East Africa on dhows, usually with the monsoons. Again, the dhow traffic from the Arabian peninsula and the Gulf areas was essentially economic, involving trade in both directions. Muslim traders were often also part-time missionaries and informal prosely- tizers. In the continent as a whole the distribution of Islam has taken the shape of an inverted crescent. Islam is strongest in North Africa, West Africa along the bulge of the continent, and in Eastern Africa includ- ing the Horn of the continent. Islam in the middle of the continent is relatively weak, and in Southern Africa it is very thin indeed. The nature of the European impact on Africa had something to do with the distribution of Islam. The spread of Islam in Eastern and Southern Africa, for example, was effectively arrested by the consequences of European colonization. If Islam spread north of the Sahara through conquest, so did Christianity spread south of the Sahara by the same means. If north of the Sahara Islam spread by the sword, south of the Sahara Christianity spread by the gun. As a British poet once put it: Whatever happens we have got The Maxim gun and they have not.' But in spite of the importance of the gun in the consolidation of Christianity south of the Sahara, the European influence was not even. Islam in West Africa continued to conquer in spite of European colonization, while in Eastern Africa it was held in check by Euro- pean colonization. The question arises, why the difference? One possible explanation for the greater vigour of Islam in West Africa could be its greater degree of indigenization and Africanization. Islam had ceased to be led by the Arabs and had acquired an independent dynamism in Western Africa. The great leaders and religious preachers, the great warriors of Jihad like Usman dan Fodio were themselves indigenous Africans. This contrasted quite sharply with religious leadership in many parts of Eastern Africa, where immigrant Arabs or visiting Arabs played a disproportionate role. Throughout much of the colonial period East Africa under British rule allocated positions of Kadhis and chief Kadhis disproportionately to Islamic jurists of Arab ancestry. This was particularly so in Zanzibar, Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania) and Kenya. The fact that Mus- lim leadership in these countries was disproportionately in the hands of immigrant Arabs helped to reduce the dynamism of Islam in The couplet is from the English writer, Hilaire Belloc.</page><page sequence="3">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 819 Eastern Africa, and contributed to the slowing down of the spread of Islam during the colonial period. Another factor behind the arrest of Islam's expansion in Eastern and Southern Africa was the high visibility of the European presence in those sub-regions. The prestige of European civilization within Africa was reinforced by the actual physical presence of European settlers in those areas. Quite often a white settler presence in one African country had ramifications and a conspicuous profile in the sub-region as a whole. Thus the white settlers in Kenya exercised considerable influence over the destiny of the neighbouring coun- tries, especially Uganda, Tanganyika and colonial Zanzibar. In Southern Africa the white profile was even more conspicuous, and the aggressive exclusivity of European civilization helped to close the gates of any further Islamic expansion southwards. This was very different from the situation in West Africa where the absence of white settlers and the Africanization of Muslim leadership ensured for Islam a substantial measure of local authenticity and sheer vibrancy. But even in West Africa the impact of Islam varied considerably from one African society to another, one African culture to another. Islam among the Hausa in Nigeria, for example, is very different from Islam among the Yoruba in the same country. For one thing, Yoruba Islam is significantly less politicized than Hausa Islam. In their political behaviour the Yoruba can often be as volatile and even violent as any other Nigerians. But the Yoruba are more likely to explode in defence of ethnic interests rather than in pursuit of religious concerns. Religious explosions in Nigeria tend to be located in the north among the Hausa and their neighbours, rather than in the South among the Yoruba. When elections go wrong in Nigeria, and tempers run high, it is the ethnic organ which tends to show in Yorubaland, rather than the religious limb. On the other hand, both religion and ethnicity can get very political among the Hausa in Nigeria. Periodic religious explosions have occurred involving Muslims of different denominations in the north of the country, sometimes costing a lot of lives. The Jihad tradition among Nigerian Muslim northerners is latent and potentially revivable. The links between religion and politics among the Muslims of northern Nigeria are deeper and more durable than such links among the Muslims of southern Nigeria. The major reason is that historically the pre-colonial Hausa city-states often attempted to enforce the Shari'a (Islamic law) and fused church and state. Yoruba states and kingdoms before European colonialism tended, on the other hand, to be based on indigenous Yoruba customs and traditions, rather than primarily on the Shari'a. Yoruba Islam in these post- colonial times remains less Arabized and less subject to politicization</page><page sequence="4">820 Journal of the American Academy of Religion than Hausa Islam has tended to be. It is because of these consider- ations that Yoruba Muslims have sometimes been regarded as Yoruba first and Muslim second-while Hausa Muslims have been perceived as the reverse. THE CRESCENT AND THE CLOCK But whatever the precise combination and weight between indig- enous loyalty and Islamic allegiance, the Muslim presence in Nigeria has deep roots. And the number of Muslims in the country is greater than the number of Muslims in any Arab country, including Egypt. In other words, Islam in Nigeria has more followers than Islam in any single Arab country, mainly because Nigeria itself is of course much larger than any particular country in the Arab world. There have been occasions when Nigerians going on pilgrimage to Mecca constituted either the largest or the second largest contingent of pilgrims from any part of the Muslim world. In 1981, Nigerian pilgrims once clocked the one hundred thousand mark, the largest contingent from any Muslim country. The decline of the number of pilgrims in subsequent years was due mainly to foreign exchange problems in Nigeria. This resulted in greater control of numbers of pilgrims permitted to go by the federal government. The inhibitions of the modern state system and the constraints of the world economy were now intruding more decisively into Islamic calculations in post-colonial Africa. But in a sense these new international horizons within Africa are themselves an extension of a process which was initiated by Islam- ization in some parts of Africa. Islam introduced a new understanding of distance and space, as well as a new understanding of time and duration. The obligation on every Muslim to go on pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime was itself an extended perception of distance. Africans newly converted to Islam were forced to think of a far away place called Mecca not simply as the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad but as a target for their own travelling in their own lifetime. What is more, Mecca was prevented from becom- ing too vague by the requirement that five times every day a Muslim should face Mecca in his or her prayer. The combination of facing Mecca five times a day, and the aspiration to go on pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime and sometimes several times, transformed perceptions of space and distance among African com- munities which in some cases had previously been confined to villages and constrained by rural perspectives. In the centuries of Islam many Africans marched overland over many months, not running away from pestilence or drought, not seeking new worlds to conquer, but simply in quest of Mecca.</page><page sequence="5">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 821 Reportedly there are two million Nigerians in the Sudan who are descended from pilgrims who either never made it to Mecca but stopped in the Sudan or, more likely, stopped in the Sudan on their way back and never made it to their homes in Nigeria ever again. The grand trek to the twin cities of Islam, Mecca and Medina, was itself a kind of annual Bantu migration, a new revolution in mobility for many sectors of African society. But Islam also introduced its own disciplines of time in societies which previously felt less pushed by considerations of punctuality. Again, Islam's discipline of time was related to the five prayers of the day. These prayers were spaced out across the twenty-four hours with a good deal of precision. Each prayer had to be performed within its own allocated time during the day. It was normally a sin to postpone the prayer unless there were exceptional and compelling reasons. Sensitivity to the time of the day was a pre-condition for avoiding the sin of ritual procrastination. It is a common sight in Muslim Africa to see a trader or hawker at the road side interrupting his business in order to perform a particular prayer of the day. The prayer had to be done (not just "said") at that particular time. In many indigenous African societies such a pre- occupation with exact time was a significant social revolution. What all this means is that the ethos of punctuality in much of Africa did not come initially with Western culture and its obsession with precision in time. That ethos initially came with Islam. But did both imported civilizations fail to tame Africa into the discipline of punctuality? The answer is that Islam succeeded in promoting punc- tuality in the religious sphere, but failed to extend it to the secular domain. Muslims do observe their five prayers each day, usually within the prescribed times allocated to those prayers. Muslims search the skies for the sight of the new moon in order to ensure that the rituals of the different lunar months are satisfactorily observed. The fast of Ramadhan, from the hours before dawn to sunset, is prescribed with precision. It is a sin to eat at dawn, so one has to be sure precisely what time it is. It is also a sin to eat before the sun has gone completely down, and this also requires a sensitivity to minutes and seconds, and not just to hours. As for the pilgrimage to Mecca, it has a precise week in the year, and the different steps are carefully timed within the rituals of the Hajj. Strictly speaking, Islam was all set to inaugurate a revolution in time among its converts in Africa, as well as in the Arab world. The revolution in the discipline of time succeeded strictly within the religious domain. Both the Arab world and Africa have had to await the greater impatience of Western civilization before the ethos of punctuality could be secularized. Even then the West has failed to</page><page sequence="6">822 Journal of the American Academy of Religion make Africa observe the clock with the same attentiveness with which it observed the clock under Islamic stimulation. Appointments with visiting businessmen and professors in transit in African cities are sometimes broken with impunity or at any rate subjected to delay. But appointments with God are a different case. That is why the Muezzin calling believers to prayer is a more compelling alarm-clock in Muslim Africa than all the chimes of Big Ben and the Greenwich time signal. The most important prayer of the week in Islam is of course the mid-day prayer on Friday. Only certain mosques are used for that prayer in order to encourage believers to assemble in a limited number of places and thus ensure a higher level of collective worship on Friday. Most of the remaining mosques are closed for that partic- ular prayer. The mosques chosen for the Friday prayer are sometimes not large enough to accommodate the huge crowds which turn up. Many such a mosque in African witnesses great overflows of believers, sometimes into the streets, bringing traffic to a standstill during that hour and a half of worship. Non-Muslim Nigerians have been known to complain about this disruption of traffic, but since Muslim Nigeri- ans are forced to observe Sunday as the Sabbath instead of Friday in spite of the fact that there are more Muslims than Christians in Nigeria, their grievances probably cancel each other out. THE LANGUAGE OF GOD The Friday prayers are preceded not only by the Muezzin calling believers to prayer, but also by a sermon. In many parts of Africa the sermon is still entirely in Arabic, although the bulk of the congrega- tion south of the Sahara might not understand the Arabic language. In Zanzibar since the 1964 revolution some degree of Africanization of the Friday ritual has taken place, including the introduction of a Swahili section to the Friday sermon. The rest of the sermon is still in Arabic, notwithstanding the language of the congregation. The actual prayer itself, involving bowing to God, kneeling and prostrating before God, is usually accompanied by oral recitations from the Qur'an. Again, the words recited throughout the actual formal prayer are entirely in Arabic. This brings us to a striking paradox concerning Islam in relation to Christianity in Africa. Strictly from the issue of the language of worship, Islam has been less compromising than Christianity. It is as if the God of Islam understood only one language, Arabic. Formal prayer and ritual in Muslim Africa, as well as in the bulk of the rest of the Muslim world, is conducted almost entirely in the Arabic lan-</page><page sequence="7">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 823 guage. Most Muslim children have to learn the art of reading and reciting the Qur'an even if they do not actually understand what the words they are reciting really mean. That is why many Muslim schools in Africa are referred to as Qur'anic schools, emphasizing the actual verbal mastery of the Holy Book. Most of the hymns in the mosques in Africa are in the Arabic language, which are memorized and recited, not necessarily with a command of their meaning. It is in this sense that Islam in Africa is linguistically uncompromising, demanding due conformity with the language in which God commu- nicated with humankind. In contrast, Christianity has quite often communicated with Afri- cans in the language of their own societies. The Bible was translated into indigenous African languages quite often decades before the Qur'an was. Services in African churches are often conducted in indigenous African languages. Hymns, though sometimes originating in Europe, have been translated quite early and are often sung in indigenous African tongues. At least at the level of language, Christi- anity has made more concessions to Africa than Islam has done. And yet in other respects Islam has appeared to be more accom- modating to the wider culture of Africa, more ready to compromise with African ancestral customs and usages. For example, the use of the drum in certain Muslim ceremonies in Africa contrasts with the stricter disapproval of the drum in comparable Christian ceremonies. Islam has also been less militant against certain practices which are both un-Islamic and un-Christian. One illustration is female circum- cision. European Christianity has often taken a strong position against this custom which is practiced by a minority of African societies. The most dramatic confrontation between Christian churches and this particular African custom was in Kenya during the colonial period. And even more recently Christians under European leadership have regarded female circumcision as abhorrent and, in some important respects, un-Christian. It is possible that by the canons of orthodox Islam female circum- cision is equally alien and un-Islamic. And yet such deeply Muslim societies as Somalia and Northern Sudan practice female circumcision on a relatively wide scale. Islam has interfered less with this pre- existent African custom than Christianity has sometimes done. There is also the issue of areas of accidental similarity between Islam and traditional Africa. A widely discussed area of congruence is attitudes to polygamy, the marrying of more than one wife. Islam has a limit of four wives, whereas traditional Africa has an open ended policy. Normally African Muslims have not been tempted to go beyond four wives in any case. It has been widely suggested that part</page><page sequence="8">824 Journal of the American Academy of Religion of Islam's success in Africa is precisely its greater toleration of polygamy as compared with monogamous Christianity. But this kind of argument overlooks other disciplines which Islam imposes and which Christianity does not. Among these is Islam's prohibition of alcohol. Many traditional African societies used alcohol for a variety of cultural and ritual ceremonies. African Islam has not made concessions on this issue. At least until Western influence entered the scene, African Muslim societies were relatively strict in avoiding alcohol. The revival of alcoholic drinks in Muslim Africa is not because of a revival of indigenous African alcoholic pastimes, but is more due to Western alcoholic penetration. On the whole, while it is indeed true that Islam in Africa had gained from not being monogamous, Christianity in its turn has gained by not being opposed to alcohol. Africans being courted by the two religions have had to choose between the discipline of being satisfied with only one wife and the discipline of being satisfied with only soft drinks. In many instances the choice has not by any means been easy. But on the wider spectrum of comparison, it remains true that Islam has been more accommodating to indigenous African customs and traditions than European Christianity has been. I use the term "European Christianity" to distinguish between the religion which came with the European missionaries in the 19th and 20th centuries, on the one hand, and the Christianity of Ethiopia and North Africa, on the other. Ethiopian Christianity has certainly accommodated itself with female circumcision in traditional Ethiopia. A fusion of Christian and pre-Christian Ethiopian ways has occurred. The precise mixture has been unique. But why has Islam combined linguistic intolerance in the mosque with a wider cultural accommodation? Why has it insisted on the primacy of Arabic as a medium of prayer with a spirit of compromise towards the wider aspects of African traditions and lifestyles? Let us take the two parts of the question separately in turn-linguistic intolerance on one side and wider cultural compromise on the other. Islamic theology has divided the world conceptually into Dar el Islam and Dar el Harb (the Abode of Islam as against the Abode of War). The Abode of Islam is of course the Muslim world as a whole, the lands where Islam is supreme as a way of life if not as a system of law. The Abode of War is the rest of the world, but only in the sense in which Thomas Hobbes, the English philosopher, meant by "a state of war" Both Islam and Thomas Hobbes are really referring to a situation where there is no recognised central authority, and where everyone is for himself with the possibility of war constantly on the horizon. Within the Abode of Islam there is an official language-just as</page><page sequence="9">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 825 every African country in the second half of the 20th century has had an official language. The official language of Islam is Arabic. This is because Arabic is the language in which the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The fact that the holy book of Islam is actually available and read in the original language in which it was revealed has a lot to do with the possessiveness with which Muslims treat Arabic. There is no Christian equivalent of that language. Only a few scholars ever read the Bible in the language in which it was originally written. Indeed, the evidence would seem to suggest that the language in which it was written is now dead. And certainly very few Christians recite anything from the Bible in the language in which Jesus himself spoke. This is in sharp contrast to Islam, where the words of the Qur'an are precisely the words that the Prophet Muhammad used to commu- nicate to his followers what he felt was the message of God. GODS IN EXILE What all this means is that the Bible has from very early times been primarily a work of translation. Afterall, Christianity did not triumph among the people to whom it was first revealed-the ancient Hebrews. Christianity has its greater successes away from its own cradle. It became preeminently the religion of the foreigner, the religion of the gentiles. By becoming the religion of the stranger, it entered into the realm of translation almost from the beginning. This is the history of the estrangement of Christianity. The message of Jesus started as a sect of Judaism. Early Christians accepted Jewish rituals, and the Jerusalem church insisted on circum- cision and saw itself as operating under Mosaic Laws. It was the Christian Jews of the diaspora who started the trend towards universalism. The first such Christian Jew, Stephen, de- manded the abrogation of the Mosaic Code. He was taken before the Jewish Sanhedrin, the arbiter. He denounced official Judaism as unreceptive to the Holy Spirit. Stephen was stoned to death-the first Christian martyr. Persecution of liberal Christian Jews followed, and many had to flee to Antioch. The Antioch Christians began something which was to transform the world-they began to convert gentiles and to insist that gentiles did not have to circumcise. The Antioch Church of young Christianity then started to send missionaries to neighbouring prov- inces. Paul was probably the first to preach a thorough-going and complete Christian universalism. As he declared in his letter to the Romans "there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek; the</page><page sequence="10">826 Journal of the American Academy of Religion same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him."2 The imperative of translation was beginning. Between the years 48 and 58 A.D. Paul travelled through much of Asia Minor and Greece, preaching to Jews and Gentiles alike. Christianity began to penetrate the Eastern Provinces of the Roman Empire. Even Rome itself was to witness before very long a small Christian community. Multi-lingualism was beginning to be a feature of the new Gospel. The Christian religion was spreading, becoming indeed internation- alized, but at the same time becoming isolationist in a contradictory manner. It was internationalized in the sense of making converts among new cultural groups and across provincial frontiers. But Chris- tianity was also isolationist in the sense of living apart and refusing the pagan worship of the God-Emperor. Christians regarded emperor worship as idolatory. The Roman government in turn regarded Chris- tian refusal as treason punishable by death. Christians prayed in secret-and many were thrown to the lions. The next major divide in the history of Christianity came in the 4th century. Christianity had grown to such an extent that recognition by the Roman Emperor seemed politically desirable. The Edict of Milan was proclaimed in 313 A.D. by Emperor Constantine I, giving toleration to Christianity on an equal footing with other religions. Why did Emperor Constantine do it? According to one legend, he called on the God of Christians in a critical battle and saw the sign of the cross in the sky with the words In hoc signo vinces ("in this sign thou shalt conquer"). Emperor Constantine delayed his own formal conversion to Chris- tianity until rather late in his life. And at least on the eastern part of his Empire he never abandoned the concept of God-Emperor, but he did lay the foundations of Christianizing the Roman Empire. And that foundation served as the genesis of European Christianity, and the origins of the estrangement of the message of Jesus away from the people among whom it was initially revealed, and moving towards a fundamental condition of translation. Islam had no such experience in estrangement. The people from among whom it was first revealed were converted overwhelmingly to that religion. It is true that only a fraction of the Muslims of the world today are in fact Arab. The population of Muslim Indonesia alone is almost the equivalent of the population of the Arab world as a whole. The Muslim population of the Indian peninsula or South Asia (Mus- lims of Pakistan, Bangladesh and India itself) outnumber the popula- tion of the Arabs in the world. The Muslim population of the African 2 Romans X, 12, Revised Standard Version.</page><page sequence="11">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 827 continent is greater than the Arab population outside Africa by a ratio of two to one. But while it is indeed true that Islam has expanded beyond the Arabian peninsula, and far beyond the Arab world, the Arabs them- selves are overwhelmingly Muslim in allegiance. Two factors have maintained Arab centrality in the fortunes of Islam, the Arabic language and Mecca. There is little doubt histori- cally that the Qur'an as it exists today was the Qur'an of the days of the Prophet Muhammad and were the words in which the Prophet communicated the message of God to his followers. That degree of authenticity is assured in Islam to a degree which is far greater than what can be guaranteed with regard to the authenticity of the Chris- tian New Testament. But in addition the major capitals of Christianity for Africa in the 20th century are places like the Vatican in Rome and Lambeth Palace in London. It is very doubtful that Jesus Christ visited either Rome or London. The estrangement of Christianity is captured in that very contradiction. Indeed, until Pope Paul was elected Pontiff, the Papacy had been dominated by Italians for several centuries. Christian leadership on a world scale was an exercise in estrangement and Eurocentrism. It is against this broader background that we can understand why it is that in Christian churches in Africa today there is readiness for linguistic accommodation and compromise, acceptance of foreign languages as media of communication with the Almighty. Where would European Christians be if they could not communicate with God in languages other than those used by either Jesus or his Apostles or the writers of the Gospels? On the other hand, the Abode of Islam could rightly take pride in an official language, bequeathed in entirety across the centuries from the pulpit of Muhammad himself. Indeed, the Qur'an has been the greatest stabilizing factor behind the Arabic language itself, prevent- ing literary Arabic from too drastic a departure from the style of the Qur'an. It is a major principle of Islam that the Qur'an cannot be imitated. This is the doctrine of the Qur'anic inimitability. And yet, by a curious twist of fate, no book in human history has served as a greater model of imitation than the Qur'an has done to Arabic literature throughout the ages. It is against this wider background of principles of authenticity and linguistic uniqueness that we have to understand why in the mosques of Black Africa, from Dakar to Dar es Salaam, the Arabic language has been permitted to reign supreme in spite of the fact that the majority of the congregation do not understand it. It is the official language of Muslim communication with God. But that is because it is</page><page sequence="12">828 Journal of the American Academy of Religion also the authentic language of Islam's communication with its own ancestry, its own dawn. But why is it that the religion which is linguistically monopolistic should at the same time be more tolerant on a wider scale? Why should Africans, on the one hand, be expected to pray to God in the Arabic language, and on the other hand be permitted to uphold female circumcision and the use of the drum in at least certain areas of worship? This in turn is related to the origins of Islam before the African phase. To begin with, Islam envisaged itself as being a fusion of three religions and ways of life-Judaism, Christianity and the religion fostered by the Prophet Muhammad. Islam's trinity was not a trinity of God but a trinity of religion-a linkage among the three most impor- tant Semitic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. And so doc- trinally, almost from the beginning Islam had the seeds of multi- culturalism, an acceptance of at least three different peoples of the book-Jews, Christians, Muslims. And then soon after the Prophet Muhammad's death in the year 632 A.D. Islam took on the challenge of non-Arab parts of the world. Islam conquered Syria in the year 636 A.D., Iraq in the year 637 A.D., Mesopotamia in the year 641 A.D., Egypt in the year 642 A.D. and Persia (or Iran) in the year 651 A.D. The twin processes of Arabization (bequeathing the Arabic language as a native language) and Islamiza- tion (bequeathing Islam as the official religion) got underway in most of these conquered territories. Indeed Syria, Iraq, Mesopotamia, and Egypt got Arabized linguistically as well as Islamized religiously. Persia (or Iran) got Islamized religiously but not Arabized in identity. Arab imperialism fostered the spread of Islam beyond the Middle East. New religions had to face the Islamic challenge. Of course Zoroastrianism in Persia tried to fight off Islam, fled to some extent to India in the form of the future Parsees, and retained a small presence in Iran. Hinduism in India had to accommodate some Islamic pres- ence, losing many followers to Islam, but retaining a Hindu majority. Christianity in Egypt and the rest of North Africa was on the defensive with the coming of Islam. Indeed, North Africa is one area where Christianity really suffered severe setbacks as a result of Islamic conquest. The bulk of North Africa was dis-Christianized perma- nently. In a way the success of Islam against North Africa was more profound than the success of Christianity against Islam in Africa south of the Sahara. While Islam in North Africa earlier in history effectively replaced it as the dominant religion, Christianity south of the Sahara in the 19th and 20th centuries at best only arrested the spread of Islam and seldom replaced it altogether.</page><page sequence="13">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 829 The origins of cultural accommodation in Islam go back not only to the conquests we referred to earlier but also to the shift quite early in Islam from the Umayyads in Damascus to the Abbasids in Baghdad. The Umayyad empire after the death of the Prophet was still primarily Arab. The ruler Muawiya assumed authority in the year 650 A.D. Islam was still an Arab democracy in essence, with power based on a federation of Arab tribes. But then came the Abbasid revolution in Baghdad, and the consolidation of authority from the year 744 A.D. to the year 754. This was the period when the Arab factor in Islam had to confront the non-Arab factor in terms of a primordial social conscience. The question of the equality of Arab and non-Arab Muslims was put to its most direct test during the Abbasid Caliphate. The great division between Sunni Islam and Shiite Islam remained unresolved. Most Arabs are Sunni Muslims; most Shi'a Muslims are non-Arab. The stage was set for a sectarian divide which was to last the bulk of the remaining period of Islamic history. But behind that very mixture of culture and orientation was a predisposition towards syncretism. Islam was ready to accommodate divergent customs and cultural orientations. Sometimes these new elements enriched Islam, quite fundamentally. Certainly the Persian contribution to the artistic and cultural wealth of Islam has been inestimable. Many of the stories of the Arabian Nights are really Persian or Iranian stories, rather than Arab legends. The Moghul Empire of India has also been a major enriching experience in Islamic history, Islamic architecture and Islamic art. After all, the Taj Mahal is one of the great architectural monuments to Islamic civilization. It is against this background that we can say that Islam in Africa has been culturally accommodating, in spite of being linguistically monopolistic. COMPARATIVE ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE But there are other factors as to why Islam in Africa was less subject to acculturation and dis-Africanization. The fact that the Islamic religion is not under a formal priesthood, and not subject to formal structures of decision making, has been a major element in the cultural flexibility of Islam. There is no priestly hierarchy, no Vatican, in Islam's infrastructure. Much of the business of the religion has been completely decentralized. To that extent Islam, unlike Catholi- cism, does not have to look to a fountain-head of authority, to legitimize particular departures from mainstream ritual. The decen- tralization of Islam in terms of church organization has been a major element behind its accommodationist inclination.</page><page sequence="14">830 Journal of the American Academy of Religion This is really another irony in the history of the two religions. After all, Muhammad was to all intents and purposes a head of state when he died. Islam had become substantially centralized politically before its founder left the scene. Mecca and Medina constituted a tale of two cities, two capitals of a new and expanding civilization. A new political community had come into being, complete with its own juridical system under the Shari'a, a tax system based on the Islamic Zakat, a constitutional order based on Islamic theocracy. Muhammad died virtually as a head of state, presiding over a centralized social and political order. And yet the same religion which produced a founder of Islamic centralism also produced an order of missionary decentralization. The priesthood was not formal or specialized. The missionary activity was neither organized nor institutionalized. The religion which had pro- duced a centralized political order did not produce a centralized missionary order. Muslim missionaries had been disproportionately individual, informal and almost casual. I myself converted two or three followers of indigenous African religions to Islam. Curiously enough, I bequeathed my name to them. Each of them began to have two fathers, biological and religious. I was their religious father. In one case, the man was older than me. He became Ramadhan, son of Ali (meaning myself) although I was at least a decade younger than him. Why was he named Ramadhan? Because, almost masochistically, he embraced Islam on the eve of the fasting month of Ramadhan. He therefore had to undergo the discipline and relative agonies of self-denial during the fasting month. I named one of the other converts to Islam Hassan, after one of the grandsons of the Prophet who were martyred. I kept in relative contact with my religious offspring for as long as I remained in East Africa before my departure for higher studies in England. When I got lost in the new civilization of Huddersfield, Manchester, New York and Oxford, I lost all contact with my "children"-especially Rama- dhan and Hassan. Indeed, they were my first "children". I had reli- gious offspring before I ever had biological children. During the same period I knew of an Indian missionary in Africa, a follower of the Aga Khan. He had taken a vow to convert at least a thousand Africans to Islam. Curiously enough, his ambition was not to create more followers of the Aga Khan in Africa. He realized that the majority of African Muslims were Sunni. The Aga Khan followers were a branch of Shiite Islam. In spite of the sectarian difference, the Indian missionary was dedicated to the conversion of a thousand Africans to Sunni Islam, avoiding the potential cleavage across the sectarian divide. The Aga Khan himself approved of this discriminat-</page><page sequence="15">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 831 ing fastidity. Indeed, the Aga Khan had conferred upon his African missionary the title of El'Afriqi, meaning the One of Africa. In general the most striking thing about proselytism in Islam is precisely its basically decentralized nature and its essentially infor- mal characteristics. The religion which had produced a relatively centralized government seemed to be unwilling to produce formal centralized missionaries. On the other hand, the religion which had produced the underdog on the cross, the man who could pronounce neither temporal legisla- tion nor temporal taxation, the man who was tried by the laws of others, could at the same time inspire a relatively centralized church and a hierarchical system of authority. Christian denominations, especially Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and to some extent Anglican, have been denominations of more centralized authority than anything within the missionary activity of Islam. Whatever may have happened in the 7th century in terms of Islamic centralization, Islam has become a religion of informal conversations with God. On the other hand, whatever may have happened in the crucifixion of Jesus and the denial of Christian power to the founder of the religion, Christianity has since become a language of cultural hegemony and a structure of church authority and hierarchy. It is once again against this broad background that we have witnessed Islamic linguistic intolerance, on the one side, and Islamic cultural compromise, on the other. It is against the same background that we had witnessed the reverse phenomenon-Christian linguistic toleration, on the one side, and the narrow-minded Christian response to Africa's cultural customs, on the other. But Christian missionary activity in Africa has always been pre- pared to dig its own secular grave. Christian schools in the African continent have been among the major carriers of secularism in the total African experience across generations. All Christian schools were simultaneously carriers of Western secular skills and values. The missionary schools taught mathematics as well as religious studies. Sometimes philosophy as well as catechism, social studies in the here and now as well theology about the hereafter. Young Christians like Kwame Nkrumah, products of missionary schools, once considered becoming actual priests-only to change their minds and become politicians with a rendezvous with history. It is one additional irony of African history that Christianity, so often identified with European imperialism, should at the same time have produced so many African nationalists. The struggle against imperialism, as well as the struggle for imperialism, owes a good deal to the Christian impact upon Africa. What all this means is that Christian missionary schools were</page><page sequence="16">832 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ambivalent, while Muslim schools were single minded. Christian schools split allegiance between Western Christianity and Western secularism, whereas Muslim schools concentrated allegiance to Islam on its own. The schooling wing of Islam never undermined the belief structure of Muslims. But the schooling wing of Christianity often undermined religiosity through secularism. In a sense this is the masochistic side of Christianity which goes along with its theme of estrangement. At least in Africa Christianity has come with a death wish, an orientation towards self-nullification. I suppose this is because by the time Western interests emerged in Africa, Western secularism was beginning to gain ascendancy over Western Christianity. The results from an African point of view was an African Christian masochism, promoting the Gospel by destroying it, inculcating faith by promoting secularism, creating a new religious order by building a new secular order. It has been one of the more bizarre orientations of religious history ever. One result has been the remarkable irony that Christianity has been both an ally of colonization and a partner in liberation. African nationalists who are products of missionary education include not only Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, but also Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Some of these missionary products have actually flirted with the possibility of going into the priesthood itself. It is one of the more remarkable features of African nationalism that some of the more dynamic nation- alistic leaders should in the past have considered the priestly option, for better or worse. The fear of the clock is still part of the general scene. The time of the pilgrimage to Mecca remains suitably predictable. The strand of the triple heritage is still discernible. As for the actual distribution of Islam in Africa, the more deeply and historically durable is of course Arab Africa itself, which is highly Islamized. The significant minority in Egypt is religious, the Copts, whereas the significant minority in the Maghreb is linguistic, the Berbers. Next to Arab Africa are those Black African societies which have a clear Muslim majority. These include such countries as Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Niger and Somalia. Countries with Muslim pluralities (where Muslims are the largest single group but not necessarily the majority) include Sierra Leone, Chad and perhaps Liberia. African countries with approximately as many Muslims as Chris- tians include Tanzania, Ethiopia and Nigeria. African countries with Muslim minorities, who have sometimes produced the ruler of the nation, include Uganda and Gabon.</page><page sequence="17">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 833 African countries with Muslim minorities without likely preten- sions to power include Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Cameroon. It is conceivable that the Ivory Coast has a Muslim plurality but for the time being a Christian supremacy seems inevitable. Christian countries are in reverse proportion. Christianity is definitely a minority religion in North Africa, and an ambivalent religion in Western and Eastern Africa and struggling to become a majority religion in Central and Southern Africa. One is not to be surprised if the presidents of such countries as Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Somalia, Niger, Gabon, the Gambia, Sudan, Mauritania, as well as other sectors of African society are Muslim by affiliation or at least responsive to the call of Islam. But of course there are countries where Islam is over-shadowed by the Christian presence-countries like Ghana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and much of the rest of Southern Africa. The distribution of the two semitic religions has been profoundly affected by the balance of rivalry between them across the genera- tions. TOWARDS AFRICANIZING NEW GODS As a matter of fact, there are at least two main ways by which both Christianity and Islam have been Africanized. One is through rela- tively blind social forces at work across time, causing cultural mixture and sometimes synthesis. The other mode of Africanization is through a prophet or social reformer, intent on giving greater native meaning to the imported religions or seeking to close a cultural and psycho- logical gap which Christianity and Islam have sometimes created in Africa. So far we have discussed indigenization through blind social forces leading to cultural mixture. Let us now take a closer look at the phenomenon of indigenization through prophetic intervention and purposeful religious reform. In the middle of the countryside in Central Africa, quite far from any major city, there stands a startling structure. It is a temple of the Kimbanguist religious movement, mainly based in Zaire. The founder of the movement was Simon Kimbangu. The Congo, as the country was then called, was still under Belgian rule when Simon Kimbangu began to challenge the white monopoly of religious leadership in the country. There were Congolese who were already framing the ques- tion in racial terms. If God wanted to communicate with the black races, would he have chosen the white man to serve as His messen- ger? Such worries have sometimes affected Christian Africans from generation to generation. But in the case of Simon Kimbangu's</page><page sequence="18">834 Journal of the American Academy of Religion followers, the answer was at last clear. This prophet was at least African; this messenger was black. But was this a case of merely Africanizing the messenger without necessarily Africanizing the message? Has the message of Jesus changed as a result of channelling it though Simon Kimbangu? Although the symbol of the cross has not completely disappeared in the Kimbanguist church, it plays a significantly more modest role than it does in the rest of Christianity. Indeed, the huge Kimbanguist Temple at Nkamba has no cross within the building. To that extent the building is startlingly unChristian within. But there is a theological reason for the low profile of the symbol of the cross in the Kimbanguist church. After all, the Almighty had always warned his people to beware of graven images and idolatry. A cross with an actual statuette of Jesus came pretty close to a graven image, according to Kimbanguist theology. But even a cross without a figure of Jesus should not be elevated too highly lest it becomes yet another version of the graven image, yet another form of idolatry. The people from among whom the Kimbanguist church emerged were matrilineal, tracing descent through the mother. The matrilineal tendencies of the wider traditional society helped to enhance the role of women in the Kimbanguist church. Women in this church can become pastors and deacons. Debates in Europe and America about whether women can become priests had not even gathered momen- tum when the Kimbanguist church gave women a firmer role. Female pastors in the church are just an extension of the mother symbol in indigenous matrilineal culture. Indeed, female religious figures and reformers are more likely to emerge from indigenous traditions than from either orthodox Islam or European versions of Christianity. The range of major female religious reformers in Africa is from women in pre-colonial Ashanti to Alice Lenshina in colonial and post-colonial Zambia, leading her Lumpa Church. Sometimes African women have shown enormous courage and readiness for martyrdom in defence of religious ideas. Way back in the year 1706 a woman in Central Africa was burnt at the stake holding her baby son. This was Donna Beatrice, otherwise known as Kimbaveta. She too was in the tradition of trying to Africanize Christianity. Some of the changes she espoused were quite funda- mental, perhaps more fundamental than those of the Kimbanguist church. For example, she argued that many of the Apostles of Jesus were not Hebrew at all-they were Africans. She insisted that the Patron Saint of Portugal was an African. She argued that Jesus Christ never prohibited polygamy. But her most controversial assertion was that a virgin birth was not a monopoly of the mother of Jesus-that an</page><page sequence="19">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 835 African woman was as capable, with God's help, of having a virgin birth as any woman in Bethlehem or Nazareth. These were of course very radical assertions. And when Donna Beatrice tried to demonstrate the virgin birth theory by having a baby son of her own, it was almost too much for those converted to Europeanized versions of Christianity. The Portuguese missionaries and Portuguese officials advising the old Congo Kingdom set to work, persuading the converted rulers of the Kingdom to take action against this female messiah. And so she was burnt at the stake holding her son. Out of those ashes arose new movements struggling once again to narrow the gap between African cultural realities and Christian doctrine. One such movement, as we have indicated, is the one which Simon Kimbangu initiated. Kimbangu himself was also a martyr. The Belgians arrested him after a while, again partly instigated by Western missionaries in the new Congo of the colonial period. Kimbangu spent almost as long in jail as Jesus Christ spent on earth. Kimbangu entered a series of Belgian cages when he was just a young man, and died more than three decades later at a relatively advanced age. His own martyrdom was not on the cross; it was in a cage. Today the Kimbanguist Church in Central Africa claims some four million followers. It may not sound like many, but when you think about it, that is more followers than Jesus Christ had in the first three centuries of the Christian era. What about efforts to Africanize Islam through prophetic interven- tion? In reality heretical prophets in African Islam have been rela- tively few and far between, partly because Islam has responded more readily to informal Africanization except on the issue of the language of worship. The recent case of Muhammadu Marwa, otherwise known as Maitatsine in Nigeria, is pertinent here. Though of Cameroonian origin, Maitatsine succeeded in arousing the enthusiasm of Nigerian Muslims in their hunger for an African prophet of Islam. In a sense the Maitatsine movement was a quest to dis-Arabize Islam. But the movement was paradoxically infused with the Jihad militancy. A number of violent eruptions between Maitatsine's followers and other Nigerian Muslims occurred in northern cities of the country, includ- ing one in 1980 which resulted in the death of the African prophet himself. Further confrontations with security forces occurred later on, including in the year 1984 when the Maitatsine zealots killed a police unit which went to investigate or arrest some of their followers. And a number of other policemen were subsequently killed when rein- forcements arrived. A massacre of the zealots occurred later on when the tables were turned. The cost of prophetic Africanization of Islam in Nigeria has been exceptionally high.</page><page sequence="20">836 Journal of the American Academy of Religion It should be borne in mind that dis-Arabization of Islam is not necessarily the Africanization of Islam. One of the best organized movements in Muslim Africa is the Ahmadiyya sect, operating in both East and West Africa. The founder of the sect was Mirza Ghulam Ahmed of old India under the British Raj. Doctrinally the movement seems to uphold the position that the Prophet Muhammad of Arabia was the most important of God's prophets but not the last. This is a major departure from mainstream Islam which insists that Muhammad was both the greatest and the last of all the prophets. The Ahmadiyya movement has quite extensive missionary activity in Africa. It is often bitterly opposed by Sunni Africans, who are the great majority in the continent. My own father wrote a number of passionate essays against the Ahmadiyya movement, and was con- stantly at loggerheads with the Indian-derived sect. In East Africa the Ahmadiyya movement was also the first to translate in full the Qur'an into the Swahili language, the most widespread indigenous language in the continent. Again Sunni Mus- lims strongly reacted against the Ahmadiyya translation. My father as Chief Kadhi of Kenya once again took the leadership in this reaction. He started translating the Qur'an himself, and made some progress, but he never lived to complete the job. His fragment of the translation was published posthumously. Later on, another Chief Kadhi of Kenya, Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Farsy, provided a more complete Qur'an in Kiswahili. The central charge against the Ahmadiyya movement, which still commands many followers in Eastern and Western Africa, remains that of claiming the status of a new prophet after Muhammad. But the fact that the new prophet, Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, was an Indian attempted to shift the focus of Islam away from the Arabian peninsula. To that extent the Ahmadiyya movement has in part been an effort to dis-Arabize Islam to some limited extent, but not actually to African- ize it as yet. It has taken people like Maitatsine to embark upon a more complete attempt to Africanize Islam. But not all Messianic African movements under Islam are neces- sarily heretical. Islam has a concept of the Mahdi, a renewer and reviver of religion, but not necessarily a full scale prophet in the technical Islamic sense itself. Perhaps the most famous and most enduring Mahdist movement has been in the Sudan. A substantial section of Northern Sudan was aroused in the 19th century against British penetration and to some extent against Egyptian overlordship. Again the movement took the form of the Jihad, and initiated military action against the foreign intruders. Gordon from Britain was killed in the Battle of Omdurman. The Mahdist movement has itself continued</page><page sequence="21">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 837 in more peaceful forms to the present day, but it has retained a considerable political orientation. Less militant in the military sense have been the Mourides of Senegal, an Islamic brotherhood that grew out of the Qadiriyya movement of the Sufi branch of Islam. The Mourides came into being in the second half of the 19th century under the leadership of Amadou Bamba. Like the Mahdist movement in the Sudan, the Mourides were responding to an external threat. In the latter case it was the reaction to French imperialism and the social environment which resulted from French penetration. Amadou Bamba acquired a widespread reputation of supernatural power and grace, a capacity to perform miracles in response to persecution by the French. A Mouride picture poster exists in the modern period. It shows Amadou Bamba jumping off the ship which was taking him to exile. He spread out his mat and prayed on the waves. The French guards had forbidden him to pray on board the ship. He bid the waves be tranquil so that he could pray on them. Exile is itself a major Islamic institution. The Prophet Muhammad himself twelve centuries earlier had been forced into exile from the city of Mecca to the city of Medina. So important is this act of migration in Islam that the entire Islamic calendar begins not when Muhammad was born, nor when Muhammad first sensed revelation and became a prophet at the age of forty, nor indeed from the moment when Muhammad died. The entire Islamic calendar begins from the moment Muhammad migrated into exile. That is why the calendar is called the Hijra, the movement into exile. But the fundamental aspect of an Islamic exile is that there is a day of return, a day of religious conquest, a day of God's triumph. There was such a day when Muhammad returned to Mecca as military victor and political ruler. A more recent illustration in Shiite Islam was the return of Ayatollah Khomeini from exile in France, to assume supremacy in a new revolutionary Iran after the fall of the Shah. Once again exile was temporary, sealed with the promise of ultimate triumph. So indeed was the exile of Amadou Bamba of Senegal, as he tried to deal with a foreign conquering power. Bamba was neither as militaristic as the Mahdi in the Sudan nor as revolutionary as the Ayatollahs of Iran, but he alarmed the French enough to induce them to exile him twice for a total of twelve years. There has indeed been a final triumph in some sense. Although Amadou Bamba was not an organizer, the movement grew around him. Some claim that up to three-quarters of the population of the country are now Mouride, though that estimate may be exaggerated. What is clear is that the Mouride movement has had a major impact on both the economy and the politics of Senegal. The capital of the</page><page sequence="22">838 Journal of the American Academy of Religion brotherhood is Touba, a three-hour drive from Dakar, and founded by the brotherhood. The town is dominated by a giant mosque. The giant mosque is a towering symbol of Mouride unity and strength, a proof of the devotion of the Talibes [disciples] and of their capacity for hard work. The central minaret is 86 metres high (almost 300 feet), apparently the highest in Africa, and it is even provided with a ... lift. There are four other minarets, fourteen domes and two ablution baths ... The size of the building is most impressive, and in the flat-land around Touba surrounded by single-story dwellings, it seems all the more immense.3 Touba as a town is growing. A palace for the Khalifa-General or successor to Amadou Bamba is about to be completed. An Islamic university and a major Islamic library are also under construction. Touba has become virtually another Mecca to the Mouride Muslims of Senegal. Indeed, there are some who believe that a pilgrimage to Touba could, under certain circumstances, substitute for a pilgrimage to Mecca, but this is a heretical point of view. Certainly during the major festival of the Great Magal, now tending to be held in Decem- ber every year, many thousands of people converge on this town, reminiscent of the early days of Mecca when the Muslim community was limited to the boundaries of the Arabian peninsula. The celebra- tions in Touba today are as spectacular as those of ancient Mecca (contemporary Mecca is even more overwhelming by the scale of the number of pilgrims, sometimes up to three million in a year). When the Khalifa-General appears at the Great Magal, all are silent. The African Khalifa has arrived. The spirit of Islam lives on in the Black World. But the struggle for further Africanization of the religion of the crescent continues. CONCLUSION Long before the religion of the crescent or the religion of the cross arrived on the African continent, Africa was at worship, its sons and daughters were at prayer. Indigenous religions had a concept of divinity which was decentralized. God is not in heaven, or on a throne, or necessarily in the shape of man (anthropomorphic). The concept which some indigenous Eastern Africans callJok is primarily the process of being the essence of universal power, which inheres in life as a force in its own right. In indigenous religion, man was not created in the image of God; nor must God be conceived in the image 3 D. B. Cruise O'Brien, The Mourides of Senegal (London: Oxford University Press, 1971).</page><page sequence="23">Mazrui: Culture in Africa 839 of man. The universe and the force of life are all manifestations of God. Totemism in Africa led to groups identifying themselves with objects or other animals. Clans among communities like the Baganda adopted totemic symbols which established a sense of continuity between nature and man. Indeed, many African belief systems still include the so-called animistic tendencies, which blur the distinction between man and nature, between the living and the dead, between the divine and human, between the natural and the supernatural. The belief systems of indigenous Africa did not assert a monopoly of the soul for the human species alone. Could a tree have a soul? Could a mountain have a soul? Could a river, in spite of its flow, retain a soul? And then came Christianity and Islam with a greater focus on man as being in the image of God, and with a God often defined and described in the image of man. In the case of Christianity, God even had a begotten son. Africa has both the oldest forms of Christianity, such as those of Egypt and Ethiopia, and some of the newest forms of Christianity, such as those of the Kimbanguists. But sometimes the balance of power has shifted. In Egypt Islam has dominated the Coptic Church. In Ethiopia the Coptic Church has dominated Islam. In Egypt Islam has been more hostile to the Pharaonic legacy of Ancient Egypt than Coptic Christianity has been. In Ethiopia both Christianity and Islam have accommodated three semitic religious practices. But all over Africa the processes of both synthesis and dissonance continue. Three visions of God seek to capture the soul of a continent.</page></plain_text>
