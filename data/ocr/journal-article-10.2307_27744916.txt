<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 19, Number 2, April 2002 THE FIRST INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM: THE DISANALOGY IN PART IV OF HUME'S DIALOGUES Cameron Shelley I. Introduction In Part II of Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, Cleanthes, the advocate of natural theology, puts forward a version of the design argument. This argument purports to show that, from our experience, we are justified in inferring that the universe is arranged according to a divine plan (p. 143).1 Philo, who is sceptical of natural theology, casts the argument into a form that he calls an argument from experience (p. 149) and pro ceeds to show that the design argument, so construed, fails to work as advertised. In Part III, Cleanthes claims that Philo has misconstrued his argument and gives illustrations of arguments parallel to his own in order to educate his learned friend (pp. 152-4). Philo, we are told, appears "embarrassed and confounded" by Cleanthes' vigorous answer to his challenge (p. 155). However, in Part IV, he begins to mount a telling refutation. Naturally, a great deal has been written about this fascinat ing sequence of arguments. The main topics include the form of Cleanthes' design argument in Parts II and III, the force of the conviction that it produces, and whether or not it stands refuted by the end of the Dialogues. Although this article has implica tions for all of these issues, I wish to focus upon the nature of Philo's refutation as it is begun in Part IV. There, I claim, Philo starts out with a disanalogy against Cleanthes' argument. The 171</page><page sequence="2">172 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY presence of this disanalogy has evaded commentators to date for two good reasons. First, disanalogies in general have received very little scholarly attention and thus have a low profile. The literature that does exist concerning disanalogy also mischarac terizes it in important ways, making the concept even harder to apply properly in critical practice. Second, Philo's presentation in Part IV also anticipates alternatives to the design argument that are discussed later on so that the disanalogy, although it is explicitly signalled by Hume, is embedded in a text that Hume also uses for other purposes. As a result, scholars2 who have commented on Part IV have attended solely to the hints of the alternative hypotheses that they know are coming up and fail to recognize the disanalogy that is concluded in Part IV itself. So, the remainder of this paper is given over to an examina tion of Philo's counterargument as it is presented in Part IV (pp. 160-3). Of course, I must begin with a characterization of the design argument that Philo is countering. My position is that the design argument in the Dialogues is best understood as an analogical abduction* The term refers to an explanatory infer ence generated through an analogy. This construal involves reconstruction of the argument given in the Dialogues, since the concept of abductive inference was introduced by Peirce well af ter Hume's death and since, by analogical, I mean the sharing of representational structure as described in the multiconstraint theory of analogy4 rather than the shared-attribute theory adopted by Hume and many current philosophers (section 2). The stage is then set for an examination of Philo's disanalogy in Part IV. My construal of it is also reconstructive in the sense that I apply a revised concept of what a disanalogy is in order to overcome the deficiency of the existing view, as noted above. I propose that a disanalogy is actually an analogy, but one that is derived from another analogy and that supports a conclusion unacceptable to someone who accepts the conclusion supported by the original itself. This theory runs contrary to the current view of a disanalogy as a dissimilarity that supports no conclu sion of its own but weighs against the conclusion supported by some given analogy (section 3). The reward for these reconstruc tive efforts is a reading of this central part of Hume's Dialogues that makes clear the nature and force of Cleanthes' design argu ment and Philo's first rebuttal of it, while remaining faithful to the philosophical positions of both characters.</page><page sequence="3">THE INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 173 II. The Design Argument as an Analogical Abduction In Part II of the Dialogues, Cleanthes presents the design argu ment succinctly as follows: Look round the world: Contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great ma chine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions, to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and ex plain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever con templated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are lead to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, propor tioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed, (p. 143) The outlines of this argument are clear and are largely agreed upon by commentators: The universe consists of very many parts in a coherent structure, and the functions of the parts each con tribute to the function of the whole. In short, the universe is ordered. Since this is the same condition that we observe in hu man artifacts, and since we know that human artifacts are arranged according to the plans of their designers, we may in fer, by "analogy," that the universe is arranged according to the plan of its designer, namely God.5 Certain details of Cleanthes' speech should be drawn to our attention. His argument is grounded in our experience of the universe in general, from looking "round the world," as he puts it. It also depends upon our experience with particular objects, i.e., artifacts or "the productions of human contrivance" and their designers. Thus, this argument in meant to be empirical and, as Cleanthes makes clear elsewhere (pp. 150-1, 163-4), scientific in nature. Also, the two subjects of our attention differ in scale: The universe "much exceeds" any artifact in extent and in "gran deur," "to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain." This difference in scale becomes important to a close reading of Part IV below.</page><page sequence="4">174 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Since Cleanthes' argument is putatively based on experience, Philo formulates it as what he calls an argument from experience (p. 149). This form of argument requires (a) a rule relating two states of affairs as they are always found conjoined in experi ence, and (b) a particular observation to which the rule can be applied. Cleanthes' inference can be put in this form as follows: (x) (3y) (ordered(x) -&gt; formal-cause(j&gt;,x) &amp; is-a-plan(y)) orderediuni verse) So, (By) (iormsil-C3.use(y,universe) &amp; is-a-plan(j/)). In other words, since, in our experience, an ordered object im plies some plan that is the formal cause of its order, and since the universe is an ordered object, then there is some plan that is the formal cause of the order of the universe. The basic problem with this inference is that whereas we have witnessed machines being designed and produced, we have not witnessed universes being formed (p. 151).6 In the absence of such experience, it is difficult to see how we can include uni verses among the objects to which the rule applies. Also, it is difficult to see how the observation that the universe is ordered can be made without begging the question. Cleanthes makes this assertion on the basis that the universe is "nothing but one great machine." But a machine, by definition, is something that has a plan as its formal cause, which is the intended conclusion of the argument. Thus, the design argument is, at best, circular when understood as an argument from experience. Unperturbed, Cleanthes begins Part III by stating that Philo has not fathomed the design argument (p. 152). It is no objection to that argument, Cleanthes appears to say, that the universe was created in a time remote from the creation of human arti facts, just as it is no objection to the Copernican theory that the planets reside in parts of space remote from the Earth. As Cleanthes says later in Part III (p. 155), "You can trace causes from effects: You can compare the most distant and remote ob jects." In other words, it is a mere accident that we are able to observe our artifacts and our Earth closely whereas the creation and the celestial bodies remain aloof, and these accidents should not stop us from theorizing about the kinship of artifacts and the universe or about the kinship of the Earth and the planets. If an argument from experience cannot be made to disregard ac cidental dissimilarities of time or space, then so much the worse for that form of argument. Cleanthes provides two illustrations</page><page sequence="5">THE INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 175 of arguments of the same form as the design argument to dem onstrate his point (pp. 152-4). There is much controversy over Cleanthes' response, espe cially concerning whether he (a) insists that his inference is an argument from experience in spite of Philo's criticims,7 (b) main tains that his inference is grounded in experience although not of the form of an argument from experience,8 or (c) gives up on inference in favor of an immediate connection between observa tion and conclusion.9 I take the second position (b) and, with Tweyman, see at least some prima facie merit in Cleanthes' re finement of the argument in question. The main problem facing this position is to find a form of argument that fits the religious hypothesis, as Cleanthes has called his version of the design ar gument (p. 138), and yet is grounded in experience (as Cleanthes insists it is, p. 15210) despite the fact that it fails as an argument from experience. The obvious place to give ground is in the con cept of analogy to which Cleanthes appeals. Hume, following the Baconian tradition,11 usually takes anal ogy to be synonymous with similarity such that two things are analogous insofar as they share the same attributes. For the argument from experience to work, the universe must be ob served to share all the attributes of a machine, including its manufacture. The universe cannot be classed as a machine on this basis because we have never observed its manufacture. But the argument might be rescued if we entertain a different con cept of analogy, one that does not amount to complete similarity.12 Different proposals have been tried out. Tweyman13 uses proportional analogies; indeed, proportional analogies be tween proportional analogies. Salmon14 uses Bayesian induction.15 There is no space here to provide an adequate evaluation of these approaches. Instead, I will present a third alternative, which is to use the multiconstraint theory of analogy16 from the field of cognitive science. This theory provides a valuable and fertile model of analogical thought in many fields, including scientific inference, decision making, concept revision, and so on. The merits of applying the theory here may be judged by the clarity of the interpretation that it affords. The multiconstraint theory and its application in this context can best be introduced through an example. Consider the dis covery of the circulation of blood by Harvey.17 Before Harvey published his research, it was thought, following Galen, that the blood that was distributed through the arteries was consumed</page><page sequence="6">176 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY by the body and that the blood collected in the veins was gener ated by the liver from fluids derived from food and drink.18 Guided by an analogy with the water cycle,19 Harvey theorized that the blood that traveled through the veins was, in fact, the same blood that traveled through the arteries, minus some nu trients. Harvey described his inspiration as follows:20 I began to bethink myself whether it [the blood] might not have a kind of movement as it were in a circle. And this I afterwards found to be true. We may call this motion circular in the same way in which Aristotle says that the air and the rain imitate the circular motion of the heavens. For the earth being wet evaporates by the heat of the sun; the vapours being drawn upwards condense and being condensed descend again in raindrops and wet the earth. The analogy likens the circulation of the blood through the blood vessels to the evaporation and condensation of water through the air. Harvey's research was almost immediately accepted by his peers, well before Marcello Malpighi, in 1661, actually found the capillaries that permit blood circulation from arteries to veins.

Subscripts distinguish separate instances of the same type of predicate.</page><page sequence="7">THE INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 177 This analogy may be simply represented, in accord with the multiconstraint theory, as given in table 1. This table divides up the information in the analogy in several ways. First, the left hand column represents the water cycle, which is the source analog or the domain from which information is to be drawn. The right-hand column represents the blood circulation system, which is the target analog or the domain about which we are to be in formed. Second, each row of the table pairs those elements from the source and target analogs that are placed in correspondence with each other in the analogy. Finally, the rows are grouped into three boxes. The top box groups the corresponding attributes of the analogy, the 'atomic' elements of each analog. The middle box groups the corresponding first-order relations of each ana log, the ways in which the elements of each analog relate to one another. The bottom box groups the higher-order relations of each analog, the ways in which the first-order relations are caus ally connected to one another. The content of the analogy may be read off by examining the higher-order relations of each analog. Consider the water ana log. The higher-order relations state that the heating of the water by the earth causes {cause J the water to rise into the air. The rise, in turn, enables (enable ) the air to condense the water. 77 w This condensation then causes (cause J the water to descend w2/ down through the air which, finally, causes (causew3) the water to fall onto the earth. Through a process o? copying with substi tution,21 this information is transferred to the target analog where blood may be substituted for water, flow-into for rise-into, etc., as appropriate. We may then infer, as Harvey did, that there is some process of condensation (condense^, although un observed, by which the blood is enabled (enableb) to move from the arteries and into the veins. The strength of the analogy may be evaluated by the extent to which it satisfies the following three conditions.22 First, the anal ogy should be structurally consistent in the sense that no predicate in either domain corresponds to more than one predi cate in the other domain.23 So, for example, heat and heat, 7 * 7 w b correspond only to each other, whether as first-order relations in the middle box or as arguments to the higher-order relations cause and causebl, respectively, in the bottom box. There is one exception, namely the correspondence o? air to both arteries and veins in the top and middle boxes. This exception is not a seri ous problem, however, since arteries and veins, as blood vessels, are nearly the same thing and are therefore easily treated as a unit. Second, the analogy should display semantic similarity in</page><page sequence="8">178 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY the sense that corresponding predicates should be similar in meaning, especially in the causal, higher-order relations. The analogy meets this condition quite well: All the corresponding, higher-order predicates are identical, whereas the first-order predicates are either identical or very similar. Third, the anal ogy is pragmatically useful in the sense that it warrants the inference that the arteries may 'condense' blood through some means into the veins. Harvey subscribed to the Cartesian theory that the heart forced blood into the arteries by heat, like a fur nace. Since the water cycle is also fueled by heat, Harvey regarded his analogy as producing a very plausible conclusion. The important difference, for current purposes, between the multiconstraint theory of analogy and the similarity theory held by Hume is that the new theory emphasizes shared relational structures rather than shared attributes. Were we to go only by the shared attributes of the comparison, listed in the top box of table 1, the analogy would seem very poor. Earth is not at all similar to a heart, neither is air similar to arteries or veins. Water and blood do resemble one another, of course, but one out of three must still be considered a low score overall. So, with this new theory of analogy in place, it is time to revisit Cleanthes' religious hypothesis. But first, note that, in Part II of the Dia logues (p. 144), Philo mentions inferences about the circulation of blood as examples of good, analogical inferences of the scien tific kind. Perhaps he had Harvey's work particularly in mind. Since the multiconstraint theory provides a good representa tion of Harvey's mode of thinking, it seems likely to provide a good representation of the religious hypothesis, insofar as it is a scientific inference based on experience.

These examples are very peculiar and raise issues of interpretation that would be distracting to cover here.24 Consequently, I shall refer to the version of the religious hypothesis to which Philo actually addresses his disanalogy in Part IV, and to which Cleanthes raises no protest: [I] shall prove, that there is no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be formed in the divine mind, consisting of distinct ideas, differently arranged; in the same manner as an archi tect forms in his head the plan of a house which he intends to execute, (p. 160) Philo is evidently referring to Cleanthes' use of the house as a source analog in Part II: But is the whole adjustment of means to ends in a house and in the universe so slight a resemblance? The ceconomy of final causes? The order, proportion, and arrangement of every part? (pp. 144-5) What impresses Cleanthes about houses is the intricate arrange ment of the parts and the way in which the function of each part subserves the function of the whole. We may now recon struct the design argument via the multiconstraint theory by analogy with the designed-house argument. The result is given in table 2. The meaning of the source analog may be described briefly by reading off the higher-order relations: The house is an array of parts, parts that perform an array of functions that subserve accommodation (if I may call that the function of a house). This condition enables (enable^ the house to provide accommodation. The reason the house provides accommodation is because (because^ the architect has a plan that prescribes such a house. By copying with substitution, an argument of the same form is made for the target analog of the universe. This form of argument meets Cleanthes' desired criteria. It is grounded in our experience, our experience with a house in this case. It is not circular in the sense that it does not presume that the universe is a machine like a house. Rather, it suggests that the universe consists of parts with functions that interrelate in the same manner as the parts and functions of a house. Finally, it has a form common to scientific arguments such as Harvey's argument concerning the circulation of the blood.</page><page sequence="10">180 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY We can see that this analogical argument is explanatory by extracting an abductive inference from the target analog in table 2. As described by Peirce,25 an abduction is an inference from a rule and a novel observation to a hypothesis that, if true, would explain the observation.26 This abduction has the following form: (3x) (y) (is-a-plan(x) &amp; formal-cause(x,&gt;y) ?? ordered(^)) orderediuniverse) Perhaps, (3x) (is-a-plan(x) &amp; formal-cause^,universe)). The rule (first premise) relating planned objects to ordered ones is extracted from the becauseu predicate which states that the functionality of an ordered object follows from some plan that prescribes it. The observation (second premise) that the uni verse is ordered may be extracted from the enableu predicate, since this relation states that the universe's parts enable it to provide a complex function, which indicates an ordered object.27 We can see that the inference is abductive by noting that the hypothesis, that the universe has some plan as its formal cause, combined with the rule does imply the observation in question. So, the religious hypothesis can be construed as a reasonable looking analogical abduction, which meets Cleanthes' criteria that the argument be grounded in experience and be scientific in na ture. Now it is up to Philo to point out the difficulties with the argument so construed, which he undertakes in Part IV, start ing with a disanalogy. III. Philo's Rebuttal as a Disanalogy Philo has two sorts of objections open to him and he pursues both. First, he may point out difficulties that arise from the re ligious hypothesis as it now stands. Philo sets himself this task in Parts IV and V, where he spells out several of what he calls the "inconveniences" of Cleanthes' anthropomorphism (p. 160)? Cleanthes' doctrine that God has ideas like a man's ideas. Second, he may dispute Cleanthes' reformulation of the religious hypoth esis, especially his comparison of plans internal to the universe (planh in table 2) with plans prior and external to it (planu in table 2). Philo pursues this task in Parts VI through IX, where he considers various alternative hypotheses to the religious hy pothesis. He does, however, spend some time preparing the ground for this latter project in Part IV, a practise that tends to obscure the disanalogy that is given there. It is the purpose of this section to extract the disanalogy from the text of Part IV</page><page sequence="11">THE INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 181 and bring it into focus. I begin by briefly stating and critiquing the current theory of disanalogy, putting forward my own theory, and then applying it to the first of the inconveniences presented by Philo. In the informal logic literature, disanalogies are typically mentioned in passing and are defined by contrast to analogies. Copi,28 in his influential book Introduction to Symbolic Logic, gives the traditional definition of analogy as an inference based upon the number of shared attributes. Copi29 then defines disanalogy as a dissimilarity between source and target analogs of an analogy?that is, an attribute possessed by only one analog and not the other. He then states that the effect of a disanalogy is simply to lessen the likelihood attached to an existing ana logical inference. In short, disanalogies are equated with dissimilarities, are non-analogical, and do work by weakening existing inferences rather than by supporting the generation of new ones. A detailed critique of this view is a task best suited to another forum. For present purposes, I would only remark that if analo gies are not to be equated with similarities (section 2), then disanalogies are probably not to be equated with dissimilarities. In the place of an explicit critique, I will simply state my view of disanalogy and argue for its aptness based on how well it makes sense of Philo's first inconvenience. My own view, call it the anal ogy theory of disanalogy, is that a disanalogy is an analogy (in the sense laid out in section 2) that is an elaboration of a prior analogy but that supports a conclusion unacceptable to someone who accepts the conclusion supported by the original. In other words, a disanalogy is just an analogy (and not the opposite of one), but one that has a special relation to another analogy, namely that the disanalogy is mostly identical with its accepted model but produces an unacceptable result. By showing that more-or-less the same analogy suggests incoherent conclusions, a disanalogy shows that its model was ill-conceived to begin with. Now it is time to see how this theory helps with the interpreta tion of Part IV of the Dialogues. Philo begins this criticism by stating that it applies to the whole comparison between the plans of God and humans: [I] shall prove, that there is no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be formed in the divine mind, consisting of distinct ideas, differently arranged; in the same manner as an architect forms in his head the plan of a house which he intends to build, (p. 160)</page><page sequence="12">182 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Here, Philo says that he means to address the architect/God com parison as a whole, rather than addressing only the target analog concerning God. He subsequently adds that his criticism stems from two sources, reason and experience. He gives the criticism from reason first: [A] mental world or universe of ideas requires a cause as much as does a material world or universe of objects; and if similar in its arrangement must require a similar cause. For what is there in this subject, which should occasion a different conclusion or inference? In an abstract view, they are entirely alike; and no difficulty attends the one suppo sition, which is not common to both of them. (p. 160) The stated comparison between the universe of objects and the universe of ideas (i.e., God's mind) may leave the impression that Philo is elaborating on both analogs of the religious hypoth esis. But Philo is addressing only the target analog?that is, the explanation of the universe of objects in terms of the universe of ideas. Philo's point is that the plan for an object, if it is com plete, is just as ordered as the object itself.30 (Consider the order of a dish of Peking duck and the order of the recipe for a dish of Peking duck.) Thus, if we are prompted to explain things owing to their order, we will need to explain the order of God's plan for the universe just as much as the order of the universe itself. This process promises to result in an infinite regression. Of course, by emphasizing the contrast between the material and ideal universes, Philo is setting the stage for an alternative hy pothesis in which the ideal world plays no role, but he is not yet in a position to defend this hypothesis. This dual nature of his argument continues when Philo states his criticism based on experience: [N]either can she [experience] perceive any material dif ference in this particular, between these two kinds of worlds, but finds them to be governed by similar principles, and to depend upon an equal variety of causes in their op erations. We have specimens in miniature of both of them. Our own mind resembles the one: A vegetable or animal body the other, (p. 161) Philo proceeds to point out that many mental and physical fac tors participate in the ordering of ideas and that the ordered bodies of plants and animals arise from a similar multitude of causes. Superficially, Philo appears to be anticipating the alter native hypothesis that he introduces in Part VII, where he</page><page sequence="13">THE INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 183 contrasts idealist explanations of the universe with strictly mate rialist ones. And, curiously, Philo makes no mention of architects or artifacts. Also, the fact that this criticism originates in expe rience could be read as support for the anticipatory view, since Philo does later claim that experience renders the materialist alternative more plausible than the religious hypothesis (p. 170). Although Philo is certainly preparing the ground for his later counterproposals, he has not lost sight of the disanalogy that he is currently developing, and there are positive indications of this fact in the passage itself. In the second sentence quoted above, Philo notes that we have specimens "in miniature" of the order liness of the causes of order in ideas and bodies. Recall Cleanthes' characterization of God's creation (section 2) as like a human artifact except for its massive size and exceeding grandeur. If going from source analog to target analog in the religious hy pothesis involves a huge increase in scale, then going in the other direction would naturally involve miniaturization or a huge de crease in scale. Thus, Philo is saying that he is returning to the source analog of Cleanthes' hypothesis, where that hypothesis receives its grounding in experience. Regarding the source analog, Philo espouses the Humean posi tion that the causes of our ideas may be traced into antecedent mental and physical states, and our physical states may be traced likewise without arriving at a first cause. In short, explanations of ideas are closed and unlimited under the mind-body system. So, we find that the possible infinite explanatory regression iden tified by reason is confirmed by experience (p. 161). Philo states this observation and takes the opportunity to advertise an al ternative explanation: If the material world rests upon a similar ideal world, this ideal must rest upon some other; and so on, without end. It were better, therefore, never to look beyond the present material world. By supposing it to contain the principle of its order within itself, we really assert it to be God; and the sooner we arrive at the divine Being so much the bet ter, (pp. 161-2) In addition to the alternative hypothesis that God and His plan are an integral part of the universe, as laid out in Part VI, Philo proceeds to hint at the possibilities that the universe is the re sult of growth from a seed or even of the random movement of atoms. In any case, Philo has identified an infinite regression in both analogs of the religious hypothesis.</page><page sequence="14">184 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY House architect plan* bouse array-oi-parts/, array-of- functions/, accommodation faculty We iiifiuite-regrchSft Universe Ciod planu universe array-of-partSi, array-of-functions,, good rational-faculty we infinite-regress,. has/,(architect,plaii/,) prescribe/, (plan/,,house) consist-of/5 ( house, array- of-parts/, ) perform/, (array-of-parts/,,array-of-functions/, ) subserve/, (array-of-functions/,,accommodation) provide/, (house, accommodation) has/d (arcliitect,faculty) produce/, ( faculty, plan/, ) ignorant-of/, ( we, plan/, ) amount-to/1(faculty,infinite-regress/,) hasu (God.plan,,) prescribe,, (plan,,, uni verse) consist-ofa (universe,array-of-parts,,) perform,, (array-of-parts,,,array-of-functions,,) subserve,, (array-of-functions,,, good) provideu (universe.good) has? i ( God. rational-faculty ) produce,, (rational-faculty, plan,,) ignorant.-oftt(we,plan.u) amouiit-tou(rational-faculty,infinite-rcgress,,) enable,, (consist-of? k perform,, k subserveu,provide, because^ (provide,,.has,., k prescribe,,) becauseui(has1( k prescribe,,.has^i k produce,,) becauseu2(igjioiant,-of^,produce? k amount-to,,) enable/,(consist-of/, k perform^ k subserve/,,provide/,) because/, (provide/,, has/, k prescribe/,) because/,, (has/, k prescribe/,,has/,j k produce/,) because/,2(ignorant-of/,,produce/, k amount-to/,) TABLE 3 A representation of the disanalogy between the design of a house and the design of the universe, derived from table 2. Philo concludes his disanalogy by pointing out that Cleanthes' treatment of both source and target analogs amounts to nothing more than an exercise in obscurity: It was usual with the Peripatetics, you know Cleanthes, when the cause of any phenomenon was demanded, to have recourse to their faculties or occult qualities, and to say, for instance, that bread nourished by its nutritive faculty, and senna purged by its purgative: But it has been discov ered, that this subterfuge was nothing but the disguise of ignorance.... In like manner, when it is asked, what cause produces order in the ideas of the supreme Being, can any other reason be assigned by you, anthropomorphites, than that it is a rational faculty, and that such is the nature of the Deity? ... These are only more learned and elaborate ways of confessing our ignorance; nor has the one hypoth esis any real advantage above the other, except in its greater conformity to vulgar prejudices, (pp. 162-3) Here, Philo anticipates that Cleanthes will avoid the infinite re gression of causes in the universe of our experience by citing, in the Peripatetic style, some imperceptible faculty in an architect that produces order in his plan for a house. This move does not materially alter Cleanthes' predicament as Philo has described</page><page sequence="15">THE INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 185 it, as is shown in the representation of Philo's disanalogy in table 3. This table is derived from table 2 by the addition of those points raised by Philo. The additional information can be read by inspection of the added, higher-level predicates: As Cleanthes would claim, an architect has some plan that prescribes a house because (because^ he has a faculty that produces this plan. How ever, we remain ignorant of the plan because (becauseh2) the faculty that produced it amounts to nothing other than the infi nite regression that Philo noted earlier. "In like manner," Philo says, indicating a transition now from the source analog to the target, the rational faculty that Cleanthes would ascribe to God ultimately amounts to nothing more than an infinite regression and, therefore, another confession of ignorance. Philo's argument easily meets the criteria for a disanalogy given earlier. He has constructed a new analogy by elaborating on the analogy given by Cleanthes in presenting the religious hypothesis. The elaboration consists of the infinite regression that applies to Cleanthes' explanation of the architect's plan for a house along with the fact that this regression is an implicit confession of ignorance. By analogy, a similar regression and confession apply to Cleanthes' explanation of God's plan for the universe. Philo concludes that, by Cleanthes' way of reasoning, we are ignorant of the cause of the universe. This conclusion is incoherent with the original conclusion accepted by Cleanthes since it would be nonsensical to maintain that the order of the universe evidences a divine plan and that we are ignorant of the cause of order in the universe. As an analogy, the disanalogy displayed in table 3 is at least as strong structurally and semantically as the analogy underlying the religious hypothesis, and addresses the same problem. How ever, the two conclusions cannot very easily be accepted together. Given the near identity of the two analogies, this situation sug gests that the religious hypothesis is conceptually incoherent and must, therefore, be rejected in favor of any defensible alterna tive. It is this property of disanalogies (at least disanalogies to analogical abductions) that Philo then sets out to exploit. IV. Concluding Remarks Because Philo's disanalogy is an analogy very much like his own, Cleanthes cannot object that it is methodologically unsound for the way it brings experience to bear on the meaningfulness (or lack of it) of the religious hypothesis. If he were to do so, he</page><page sequence="16">186 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY would be tearing down the foundation of his own argument. Nei ther can he claim that the particular experiences to which Philo appeals are illegitimate, since he appeals to the same ones. The nature of disanalogies makes them difficult to counter in these otherwise obvious ways. The only route of objection left open is to question whether Philo elaborated on the religious hypothesis in a legitimate way. This is the approach that Cleanthes takes, asserting what may be called the principle of non-explication, that the need for ex planation is exhausted along with the desire for it: You ask me, what is the cause of this cause [God's plan]? I know not; I care not; that concerns not me. I have found a Deity; and here I stop my enquiry, (p. 163) Philo chooses not to dispute this principle and eventually uses it to good effect to prevent Cleanthes from demanding explana tions regarding the alternative to the religious hypothesis that Philo raises in Part VII. Since Cleanthes admits the plausibility of this alternative, he is left without any good reason to reject it and hold to the religious hypothesis. From this outcome, we may judge the importance that disanalogies can have in the practise of abductive inference. The usefulness of construing Philo's main argument in Part IV as a disanalogy is now clear. For one thing, it puts a reason able interpretation on the religious hypothesis as Cleanthes presents it in Parts II and III. Interpreting this argument as an analogical abduction in the form suggested by the multiconstraint theory makes clear its connection with experience in the man ner of a scientific argument, It also makes sense of Philo's discussion of both the source and target analogs of the religious hypothesis in Part IV. If he were solely interested in advancing alternatives to the conclu sion of the religious hypothesis, then elaboration of the source analog ofthat hypothesis would not be necessary. Although Philo volubly anticipates alternatives, he is not, as yet, in a position to advance them without first extracting some additional claims from Cleanthes, namely the principle of non-explication. After Cleanthes asserts this principle in response to Philo's disanalogy, Philo is in a position to use it against the religious hypothesis further on. Finally, this reading of Part IV as conveying a disanalogy only makes sense on the analogy theory of disanalogy. Philo proceeds</page><page sequence="17">THE INCONVENIENCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 187 not by pointing out non-shared attributes of either source or target domains, but by pointing out additional, shared relational structures. Furthermore, it is to these additions that Cleanthes actually objects. The effect of the disanalogy is not in subtract ing from the likelihood of the religious hypothesis but in suggesting a conclusion that reveals the hypothesis to be con ceptually incoherent. This effect, in turn, leads us to seek better alternatives, but this second step follows from the first, rather than being identical with it as the traditional notion of disanalogy would have it. Thus, we cannot completely understand Philo's counterargument in Part IV unless we understand it as a disanalogy?on the proper sense ofthat term.
