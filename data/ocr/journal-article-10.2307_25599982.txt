<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Poet as Ironist in "Mont Blanc" and "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty" GERALD McNIEGE IN "Mont Blanc" and "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," as Judith Ghernaik says, Shelley "formulates for the first time in his own voice the themes that are to dominate his major work."1 These two finely intricate, difficult, and subtle poems were both written during the summer of 1816, while Shelley was living at Lake Geneva near Byron, a fellow tourist and frequent companion.2 The two poems are similar in theme, very different in form. "Mont Blanc" has been heavily in terpreted by modern scholars; the "Hymn" has been less studied and perhaps little understood. I would like to examine them together in this paper as basic to the understanding of the transition from Shelley's early strong allegiance to radicalism and its supporting eighteenth-cen tury philosophical positions to his less readily categorized views after 1817. This transition has been carefully examined in a recent study by Dr. Alfred F. Boe of San Diego State University. I am indebted to his work.3 I have indeed no particular quarrel with any of the excellent critics who have written on "Mont Blanc." A diversity of interpreta tions must be expected, partly because the poem addresses a central metaphysical problem on which there will be as many views as readers: that is, the problem of the relation between power and value. I will consider both poems from two perspectives relevant to that problem: (1) Shelley's interest in the semi-religious ritual of the French Revo lution, and (2) the structural functions of a mode resembling Romantic irony. I have already reviewed the first topic rather extensively in an essay "Revolutionary Ritual and Revolutionary Lyric" in my Shelley and the Revolutionary Idea (Harvard University Press, 1969). The substance of my case there was that Shelley was influenced by the program established during the French Revolution for dramatizing and giving social and metaphysical substance to the ideals of the Revo 1.

The second category, Romantic irony, I would like to summarize here a bit more fully.4 The mode was developed by late eighteenth century and early nineteenth-century German writers, but it seems fundamental to the Romantic world view and a natural result or ex pression of the Romantic problem?to rediscover value and meaning in a world drained by doubt. Romantic irony, as I shall describe it, seems to me very close to what has been called Shelley's skeptical idealism, a term developed by G. E. Pulos and Earl Wasserman which has proved useful in studying Shelley's philosophizing. As Mrs. Chernaik has pointed out, Shelley seems to start afresh with each poem, appear ing to invent his argument as he proceeds, "constantly revising assump tions, moving toward possibility, toward questions, rather than demon strating or reaffirming doctrine."5 Similarly the Romantic ironist creates something like a transcendental illusion and at the same time reveals himself as the creator or manipulator. The poems of an ironist express his yearning for the infinite and the absolute and also record his some what disillusioning realization that the yearning must forever remain yearning. Aware of presentiments of infinity, of a fleeting sense of a fundamental unity encompassing both mind and object, perceptible through the method of "associative analogy" (Wasserman's term), he comes to realize that the finite can never grasp the infinite and may conclude despairingly by acknowledging the inadequacy of language and consciousness. Shelley, for example, frequently deplored the gap between his inspiration and his compositions. Irony is implicit in the Platonic philosophy to which Shelley was attracted yet never fully converted. He begins "Mont Blanc" with a general scene which broadly suggests a relationship between mind and nature; then he describes a troubled process of discovering a perspective appropriate to his perceptions and feelings, a pattern of possible or potential meanings which will do justice to his experience without lock ing him dangerously into a fixed interpretive process. His poem searches for sufficient meaning to motivate social and political action, though the poet seems aware of the risk implicit in ironic or skeptical modes 4. On Romantic irony I have consulted Paul De Man, "The Rhetoric of Temporality," in Interpretation: Theory and Practice, ed. Charles S. Singleton (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1969), pp. 173-209; D. G. Muecke, Compass of Irony (London: Methuen, 1969); and Oscar Walzel, German Romanticism, trans. Alma Luise Lussky (New York: G. P. Putnam, 1966). 5. Chernaik, The Lyrics of Shelley, p. 62.</page><page sequence="3">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 313 of creating a sense of freedom without meaning. Sometimes one must rediscover his mission by a "leap out of language into faith." He has to imagine a "semimythical poetic figure that would exist beyond the realm of irony,"6 and for Shelley that would be the poet as hero, a Laon or a Prometheus. But he must first undertake some perilous nego tiations between subject and object. Like the Romantic ironists Shelley makes poetry out of his own pro cess of poetic thought, including the self-doubting and the uncertainties as to where the line should be drawn between transcendental illusion and transcendental insight. However, the true ironist rejoices in his own power and capriciousness, personifies natural phenomena and then chides such longings, has freedom to subvert his own creations or "imaginings." Obviously Shelley is more serious and sincere than that, but he does employ something comparable to this new mode, a mode which enlarges the range of poetry, enriches the moods it can portray, and partly obviates the problems of belief and sincerity by supporting the notion of a more complex kind of sincerity, a more com plete awareness of a mobile and divided fictional or poetic self. Shelley and the other English Romantics were frequently willing to stake a good deal on the imagination's power as a way of knowledge, of con necting mind and nature meaningfully?though they also knew how it felt to come crashing down into the prison house of single vision. "Mont Blanc" seems to me less a philosophical poem than a poem about the kinds and qualities of experience which ought to precede, correct, perhaps even eliminate the making of metaphysical philosophy as distinct from poetry. In his letter to Peacock discussing the poem, Shelley described it as an "immediate" reflection of powerful feelings excited by the scene, and the poem may seem somewhat over-deter mined by the impressions it describes. He also said it was "an undis ciplined overflowing of the soul" and an attempt to imitate "the un tamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity" of the scene which excited the feelings. Shelley's phrases unite two favorite images for experience?a fountain or bursting torrent and the notion of a reflector, that is, images which suggest that the poet's mind can be both active and passive. The mind's reaction is described as "undisciplined," paral leling the description of the scene as "untamable," and perhaps there is an implicit claim here for poetry as the most accurate kind of descrip tion, which simultaneously presents inner and outer, without arbitrarily distinguishing subject and object. 6. De Man, p. 204.</page><page sequence="4">314 GERALD McNIECE I The everlasting universe of things Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, Now dark?now glittering?now reflecting gloom? Now lending splendour, where from secret springs The source of human thought its tribute brings Of waters,?with a sound but half its own, Such as a feeble brook will oft assume In the wild woods, among the mountains lone, Where waterfalls around it leap for ever, Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves. Nature or "The everlasting universe of things" flows through the mind, or rather flows and "rolls" in waves, the latter clause perhaps suggesting a surface turbulence, something like Frost's "backward mo tion toward the source, / Against the stream, that most we see our selves in" ("West-Running Brook"), a turbulence which would en hance, complicate, even perhaps distort reflections. At first view Shelley may seem to emphasize the dominance and "everlastingness" of the sense of the external as against the reflecting and apparently some what dependent mind. There is, however, a suggestion of some modi fied interchange in the water and sound symbolism, an ambiguous mingling of subject and object, some intermediate stage between sen sation and perception. Or the qualifiers?"dark," "glittering," "re flecting," "lending," which Professor Kapstein saw as Lockean sec ondary qualities,7 having their source in mind, might indicate that Shelley's emblem defines the mind as a center of value or meaning. The "dark" and "glittering" first half of the description might also ap pertain to the outside source while the "reflecting" and "lending" might suggest the contribution of the mind, but the syntax and imagery could support a variety of possibilities: mind as central, or an inter mediate stage of raw experience, or nature as shaping and determining experience. In any event, there is a quality of immediacy, presentness, in this recreation of the wildness and excitement; and ultimately the poet may be suggesting that under the impact of such a scene it is not easy to decide how much of which, or how out there and in here co operate in the formation of experience and meaning. My own view is that the initial impression of this particular wild and staggering exper ience suggests dependence, the comparative passivity of the mind, which brings its tribute of waters to the swelling treasury of the raving stream. 7. I. J. Kapstein, "Meaning of 'Mont Blanc/" PMLA, 62 (1947), 1047-8.</page><page sequence="5">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 315 The monarch and subject image is prominent in the poem. All the meanings need not be present at the beginning of a process lyric, how ever, and irony can subsist on awareness of potential conflicts between the recaptured immediacy of experience and the fact of artifice and "imitation." The internal source of human thought ("secret springs") does seem to be distinguished from the outside world though partly dependent on it?"a sound but half its own." The "where" of line 4 is then, perhaps, the mind at the level of immediate impressions. Mountains, glaciers, deep ravines do distract the attention and stimulate the thirst for the absolute and the miraculous. So men must control the transcendental passions, get back to the sources and springs, consider imaginatively the process of mind from stimulus to perception to conception to assessment of value, watching themselves shrewdly and ironically all the way, aware of their myth and symbol-making tendencies so essential to healthy hopefulness but so easily degenerating into secure and stable creeds. Complete success has to be unattainable; there's no way of recovering real innocence of thought since past ex perience and the language employed will inevitably structure our very seeing, but it may be possible to penetrate pretty deeply under various levels of set response and perhaps undo some of the obvious mischief, error, and distortion men have translated into religions. Stanza I of "Mont Blanc" may be about mind in nature generally. Stanza II seems to consider rather more specifically the poet and his experience. The valley and ravine of the Arve, a symbol or analogue of the mind, is carved out by power "in likeness of the Arve," or the river, which now descends through the path which it has made. The ravine as image of mind lies receptive; it is dark and deep, but it is not merely passive and receptive. There are broken surfaces, recesses, projections?pines, crags, and caverns; there are alternate shadows and sunbeams. It is a "many-coloured, many-voiced vale," an awful scene dominated by the torrent which bursts through the channel it has forced. The channel also, however, contains (usually), shapes, and directs the power to the valleys below. Mind does not create its percepts, but it does give shape and meaning to what it perceives. One doesn't experience the Power itself. Rather the "excited" mind of the poet considers a myth for imagining the descent of the Power, in the knowable form of the Arve, from "the ice-gulfs that gird his secret throne." He discovers similes, seems to be moved by some necessity to find humanizing myths, as he tries to comprehend and evaluate the apparently boundless wastes. The process becomes the poem, an ironic record of the possibilities of understanding. The myth-making impulse.</page><page sequence="6">316 GERALD McNIECE deceitfully ambitious when liberated from customary checks, may be come a device for penetrating nature's mask. The "likeness" of the Arve to the unknowable ultimate Power may also be loosely compared to the Platonic concept of the relation be tween the shadows of sense and the unknowable forms of things in themselves that cast the shadows. In any event, as he considers his image of the great semi-animated Ravine, its "giant brood" of trees clinging around it, the poet glimpses the movement of time in eternity in an awareness, like perhaps that in Wordsworth's Simplon Pass sec tion, of "woods decaying, never to be decayed" (Prelude^ vi, 625). The great trees, "children of elder time," accept the devotion of the "chain less winds," which come as ever to worship, to drink the incense and hear the censer-like swinging of the priestly pines, another image of a more than passive reception of nature by mind. Rainbows are created by the play of light over the sweep of the "aethereal waterfall," a veil which covers "some unsculptured image," awaiting some possible wor ship or devotion. What lies behind the veil? Perhaps some characteris tically Shelleyan unformed or formless deity who awakens the imagina tion but does not exact pious homage. No sound can tame the commo tion of the vast and ceaseless river, but yet ironically such scenes and such awareness, productive of fanciful equivocations, can thrust the mind into a "strange sleep" of eternal silence and solitude in the midst of the noisy turbulent activity. The caverns through which the Arve's commotion echoes become a surrogate for the mind?a "Dizzy Ravine!"?vertiginous from the tame less unresting sound, the ceaseless motion, the urgent desire to compre hend and define the relentless pressures of sensation and possible mean ings. I'm reminded of Professor De Man's description of irony, "unre lieved vertige, dizziness to the point of madness," whereas sanity is re lated to social conventions, duplicities and concealments.8 Shelley has reached a stage of momentary fusion or blurring of customary distinc tions of inner and outer. Then, however, the ego or imagination reasserts and separates itself prior to developing a conscious and deliberate inter pretation. Preparing for the speculations which conclude the stanza, the speaker considers the nature of attention, of absorbed introspection, and tries to explain how the mind can isolate itself momentarily from the excitement of its own energies and experiences for self-examination, difficult though it be to separate landscape from feeling. He does seem to be involved in his "separate fantasy," gazing as in deep vision, 8. De Man, pp. 198, 203-4.</page><page sequence="7">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 317 though the matter of vision is patterns of perception and mediating symbols. The scene seems to him a kind of confusing metaphor for the goings on in his own mind. Perhaps the ravine in relation to the Power reminds him of his own relationship to the entire scene, receptively passive but also channeling, ordering, conveying the Power he senses. Professor Wasserman suggests that what is going on is a search among mental images for correspondences to an unknown externality. The poet recognizes the likely futility of his quest because he knows that the very sense of externality is only half the truth and that men subject the same data to differing modes of vision; yet such an action constitutes that illusion men call the world.9 I would suggest the rather different possibility that the trance may also represent an ironic defence from an overmastering impression of an indifferent power. The mind in this state "passively / Now renders and receives fast influencings." The mind in the enlarged or comprehensive sense of a symbol-making activity is observing rather deliberately its own opera tions as a "separate fantasy" or subject holding an "unremitting inter change" with a comparatively objective world, a "clear universe of things around." The "human mind" renders as well as receives "fast influencings," stream against stream again, to create so extraordinarily complex and blurred a set of internal and external relationships, suc cessive states occurring with inconceivable rapidity, as to suspend the sense of separateness of subject and object. This resultant "legion of wild thoughts" floats above the scene it vaguely reflects, above the dark ravine, a ravine already connected as emblem with mind, and then moves, as if by right, into the forming chambers of the poetic imagina tion. Neither ravine nor darkness is strange to poetry. That they are guests, but not "unbidden," suggests the activity of imagination, re ceptive to some sensations, shadings, nuances, and rejecting others as it synthesizes experience for insights into the nature and direction of its own activity. The mind is making, constituting reality out of the ma terials of the "primary imagination," but the process is neither inde pendent of nor irresponsible to the "out there." It is a "still cave" (si lence is associated with mind throughout the poem), a reflective center, as well as a purposely fanciful myth-making faculty, with charms and spells at hand. A poet must, it seems, create "anew the universe" with his "vitally metaphorical" language, but his responsibility as "the author to others of the highest wisdom" ("Defence of Poetry") requires a fine control 9. Earl R. Wasserman, Shelley: A Critical Reading (Baltimore: Johns Hop kins Press, 1971), p. 428.</page><page sequence="8">318 GERALD McNIECE and a rich awareness of his myth-making penchants lest he delude others into beliefs that violate the flux of tendency. As in "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," the images which the poet consults for knowledge of forms are evanescent things, "shadows that pass by," though they may suggest somewhat deceptively an origin in true being. Shelley's "still cave," where these transactions occur, is not Plato's cave, a place of total illusion. Rather his cave attempts to unite appropriate images and true ideas or forms to give us what Dr. Boe calls a glimpse of the ideal, the most we can get in this existence. The search for correspond ence may be vain, but it constitutes reality for the human mind, though the word "Seeking" may confirm that reality is neither the subjective impression nor the external thing but the active and irresolvable ten sion between the two.10 As in his "Hymn," the poet scans the fleeting ghosts (Cf. "Ode to the West Wind": "ghosts from an enchanter flee ing") and shades for true impressions, or alternately, as Professor Kap stein suggests, for proper words.11 Perhaps one must consult a host of possible equivalents to discover occasional traces of the real. As Shelley is to say later, in "Ode to a Skylark": "What thou art we know not; / What is most like thee?" The poet tries to create a comparatively true reflection of a scene or a mood now, and to do so requires a subtle ordeal of self-scrutiny, the process described in parts I and II of "Mont Blanc." The rest of the poem delineates some of the results. Stanza III takes us into the poet's reverie as he closes himself off from the noise and movement to contemplate and connect. As Dr. Boe says, Shelley turns now from speculating on knowledge to speculating "on what it is that knowledge is knowledge of."12 The stanza starts out with a distancing, self-aware qualification?"Some say." The tone may be described as speculative, skeptical, even perhaps uncertain. The "remote world" might suggest Platonic archetypes, though it is said to visit us in sleep, itself an anticipation of death. Do the mountain and the wasteland confirm, deny, or mock such speculation? As Shelley and other Romantics labored to create associative analogies they fre quently found themselves in epistemological dilemmas caused by "am bivalences derived from an illusionary priority of a subject that had, in fact, to borrow from the outside world a temporal stability which it lacked within itself."13 The conventional sense of reality and stability is challenged by doubts. Is this a sleep, or a dream within a larger, "re 10. Wasserman, pp. 227-8. 11. Kapstein, p. 1052. 12. Boe, "Development of Shelley's Theory of the Mind," p. 169. 13.

One might expect "up furled,"14 but Shelley's "unknown omnipotence" seems a rather tanta lizing deceiver, amused by our pretensions, denying our desires for a more exact or a final knowledge. He acts like the "awful Power" of "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty." Here we might expect, in our excite ment, some answers or meanings; we get questions, doubts. The al ternatives seem to be either that a deceptive power has made answers impossible or that individual life is a solitary dream within a larger dream or sleep of retreating, inaccessible circles. Neither alternative offers much consolation or hope, and the homeless spirit droops like a lonely cloud vaporized by the invisible winds. What remains after the impressions and reflections and helpless feelings is the sense of the white vastness of Mont Blanc, emblem of the infinite and eternal?a seeming center of power, of unknown and unknowable omnipotence, remote and indifferent to our feeble currents of speculation and hope?"still, snowy, and serene." What lies between the Principle of Permanence and the mind trying to understand it is "All the chaotic welter of ex perience."15 "Mont Blanc appears," the monarch of these mountain wastes, above the "unearthly" subject peaks piled around and below it. It is hardly a chaotic scene, but it is staggering?"unearthly," "unfathomable"? remote from the proportions of human knowledge and value, from the "frail form" of the poet below looking up and querying through his "imaginings" the intractable symbol. Perhaps the mountain is an em blem of the neutral law of Necessity, but that suggestion may be overly abstract for a poem about tough, value-resistant experience. The myth making imagination is hard pressed to endow the scene with life and meaning. It's unpeopled, this desert, a hostile world of storm and ruin where the eagle and wolf contend for some "hunter's bone." The poet collects adjectives stressing the ugliness, terror, and inhumanity. He exclaims at the hostility and barrenness of the basic scene, almost as if he were declaring an eighteenth-century preference for flat plains and populous cities over wild nature. Shelley's ideal did tend, like Blake's, to be imaged in the golden city rather than the unploughed wilderness. How came so terrifying a world into being? The poet examines the scene from the contrasting perspectives of myth and science in seeking 14. See E. B. Murray, "Mont Blanc's Unfurled Veil," Keats-Shelley Journal, 18 (1969), 39-48. 15. Charles H. Vivian, "The One 'Mont Blanc,' " Keats-Shelley Journal, 4 (1955), 62.</page><page sequence="10">320 GERALD McNIECE an adequate explanation or description. Was this where the earthquake daemon taught her offspring how to destroy or was some catastrophic geologic process responsible for such hideous ruin? What then is the message and the meaning of the scene? The key term is silence, an ironic silence in view of the passion for understand ing and interpretation that has been mounting in the poem. Notions of purpose and order find scant support. The poet indicates both the futility of God-making and the necessity of coming to terms with such a universe. This wilderness has a lesson, a "mysterious tongue" which can speak, though, like Keats's urn, a "silent form," not to sensual ears. It teaches "awful doubt," skepticism about our powers coupled with a deep sense of possible mystery, or a faith "mild," "solemn," "serene"? terms suited to the scene. Perhaps it teaches one not to believe too strongly in his ideas, interpretations, and faiths, a position that the reflexive ironies of the poem's tentative and groping movement could support. "But for such faith" is, of course, one of the poem's major cruxes. On the authority of one manuscript's reading "in such a faith," Mrs. Chernaik interprets but as only and suggests that the wilderness teaches "faith so mild, solemn, and serene that man, only to achieve such faith, may be reconciled with nature."16 Charles Vivian similarly interpreted "But for such faith" as "By means of such faith alone," thinking it more reasonable to presume that Shelley made the revision to sharpen the emphasis than to think that he wished to change the meaning.17 In Wasserman's view the mountain teaches skeptical doubt by divulging how little of total being is revealed to the senses and con scious mind or it teaches a mild faith in a necessarily beneficent Power and its laws.18 I will advance the rather diffident suggestion that Shelley may be distinguishing degrees or temporary states of assurance in "aw ful doubt, or faith so mild" rather than oppositions, that he may be returning to the hypothetical and mildly ironic or of the beginning of the stanza. Such a scene makes the imagination consider a variety ot stances, but faith of a religious sort generated by power and mystery in nature cannot be sustained by reflection. The mind has a built-in tendency to faith, belief, myth which it must be aware of and guard itself against, except, as Shelley says in the "Philosophical View of Re form," in political matters.19 I submit, therefore, that Shelley rejected 16. Chernaik, p. 59. 17. Vivian, p. 62. 18. Wasserman, p. 236. 19. Shelley, like Blake, unites politics and religion in the sense of Paine's "religion of humanity." Both poets use the language and stances of religion in</page><page sequence="11">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 321 the reading "in such a faith" as incompatible with his experience and his convictions. How could this scene sustain even the mildest faith, if we mean by faith some trust in the benevolent intentions of an un knowable Power? Shelley has not described a Wordsworthian nature with which the mind can be reconciled and effect an "ennobling in terchange." But there may be room for an appropriately mild, solemn, and serene faith (perhaps belief in the goodness of man and his power to reform the world wisely) which would stop short of the dangerous conversion into creeds or conviction of the kind that this scene cautions "the wise" against. Let us attempt to delineate such a faith. What does the white silence of the remote mountain say to the elect who question faith based on "gleams of a remoter world"? For them it announces a repeal. What it says ought to be used "to repeal / Large codes of fraud and woe"?for which read organized Christianity, mon archy, and the capitalist system dependent on them and sustaining them. Though strong the message is subtle, and only the adepts at present? the poets and philosophers ("unacknowledged legislators") who learn not to interpose inflexible systems and dogmas between the mind and its objects can properly hear. It proclaims the death of didacticism, of any codes based on faith in natural religion. What Shelley rejects, like Blake, is the necessary connection of the two worlds, natural and divine. One does see two rather separate worlds of power and value, both of them with claims or kinds of truth. Nature gives one kind of lesson, man's imaginings another. Nature and mind ought not to be linked or "reconciled" as in religious faith. Possibilities of meaning and relationship must be kept provisional as in poetic or symbolic faith. The mountain offers vision, not into the workings of a perfectly functioning mechanism of the Queen Mab variety, but of a puzzling, riddling power which only the flexible imagination with its rich symbols can do some justice to in terms of knowledge and value. The voice proclaims that there is a source of power and energy in the universe and that this power can be tapped and perhaps to some extent used and controlled by man. There is no or little suggestion of benevolent purpose in na ture, and hence no basis for natural theology, against which Shelley may defining the good for man, socially and politically. Comparatively Shelley is a mystic, Blake a visionary. Shelley sees language as failing ultimately to convey the innermost mystery of meaning, a view which might in the long run have made him more hospitable to orthodox religious faith; Blake, less of an ironist, sees meaning as achievable and known only as etched in vision. The visionary discovers and "forms" reality by poetic acts.</page><page sequence="12">322 GERALD McNIECE be aligned, though not consistently, with Blake. Nature warns against credulity. If there is purpose and meaning it remains hidden, even to the poet fashioning a flexible language of symbols suited to his imagin ings. We seem to see signs, we manipulate words, to convey our sense of these signs, to get at our feeling of something hidden which the symbols may seem to reveal. Ultimately our efforts to decipher the spiritual from the physical, the invisible from the visible, the hidden from the revealed may generate provisional value systems; but we must continually labor to restore the primitive sensations underlying the fabric of conceptions and imaginings lest the poetry in our systems vanish. Having paused to moralize his song, the poet returns to the scene on a more general level of description and reflection. He begins in clusively with a summons to all nature to bear witness to the dominion of cyclic change, further testimony perhaps as to why nature can't sup port a religious faith. The adjectives stress the objective or external existence of nature here and elsewhere?everlasting, clear, now "dae dal" (ambiguously connoting both intricate, ingenious artifice and la byrinth) . He names, as if conjuring a spell, first, aspects of nature in an obvious large landscape sense; second, destructive elemental forces, but also and more fully the mild and slow fruitioning process of life during the "torpor of the year"; third, all "works and ways of man," and in unison with the natural processes described, "their death and birth," both now and in any possible future. The key term is "all." The vision is comprehensive. All nature and man as within nature are seen in terms of cycle and change; all "resolve, subside, and swell." He names so much, so inclusively perhaps, to stress the separateness and the mysterious aloofness of the Power which the distant mountain may symbolize. Then he judges that something can be learned here by the observant, the "adverting mind." Clearly we have learned already, as the opposition stresses, the separateness of the worlds of change and apparent remote permanence. Still the problem is to determine their possible relationship. According to Wasserman the poet has learned that the inaccessible Power is paradoxically an eternal stillness and also that its manifesta tions move the world of sensible qualities in an endless circle of change.20 The scene is recapitulated as a "naked countenance," as "primaeval." It is a lesson in starkness, in beginnings. To such funda mental oppositions the mind must recur, if we would repeal, as above, 20. Wasserman, p. 236.</page><page sequence="13">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 323 "Large codes of fraud and woe." Judging from what follows, the scene teaches harsh lessons about reality. We behold ruin, death, waste, in difference, destruction. Looking in more closely we observe glaciers creep like snakes towards their prey. Does the poet see in the destruc tive work of the great glacial ages an ironic comment on human pre tensions, our imaginings of worth and significance? Yet Shelley himself is to say elsewhere later?"I love all waste / and solitary places; where we taste / The pleasure of believing what we see / Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be" ("Julian and Maddalo," 11. 14-17). Does the sense of the infinite grant the imagination a sense of boundless ex pansive freedom and unlimited capacity? Perhaps the desert or wilder ness gives incentive for the mind to create its own paradise, unchecked by significantly limiting natural forms. We witness here, as it were, the first age of the world. Giant ice cliffs have been piled up by the alternating activities of frost and sun, and the poet stresses the remote, cruel indifference of such natural process by seeing it as done "in scorn of mortal power." Trying to describe rightly, he sees first a great frozen city in a mixture of styles?classic, Gothic, Egyptian?not a city of man, but "A city of death" (like the Ruines traced by Volney in a book Shelley admired). Analogies, meta phors keep structuring his seeing. He is soon to correct himself?it is "not a city." It is like a city, a guarded and impregnable city, which man cannot enter. But it's no city, no image of order and civilization, rather a "flood of ruin"?an image of turbulent and indifferent and frightening process?always descending and destroying everything in its relentless path. It "rolls" down in its "perpetual stream" (echoing the first few lines of the poem). Great trees are strewn in its "destined path" or stand aside from the main carving force of the Arve, branch less and shattered skeletons in the "mangled soil," like the famine-and plague wasted leaves of "West Wind." There is a great deal of waste power in the economy of nature, it seems. Misplaced rocks, pulled down from above by the energies of the silent aloof power, can never return "reclaimed" to the scene of action. They are beyond "The limits of the dead and living world." Nature seems more like a hostile force than a substitute god. All the creatures?"insects, beasts, and birds"?and finally man himself are spoils to this indifferent, conquering power. The images keep suggesting some possible principle of intention, intelligibi lity, or direction which the tone and comments deny. "So much of life and joy is lost." Man is driven off in dread, as if from a mysterious force he would propitiate with his forms and idols. He is like smoke in a</page><page sequence="14">324 GERALD McNIECE tempest, another image recalling the opening opposition or relation of mind and nature. Then a shift of perspective occurs. Having beheld a silent and re mote source of energy and power, then violently destructive and seem ingly perpetual motion, we look below at the tumultuous birth of a great river which "rolls" on to the distant sea and "Breathes its swift vapours to the circling air." Vast caves shine in the gleam of the Cole ridgean torrents which well forth?"secret chasms in tumult welling"? to meet and swell the great stream. These caves may again express a dependent relation of mind to nature, contributing their reflected "shine" to the general "restless gleam." Since the river is the "breath and blood" of distant lands, there may be some suggestion of the ways in which commerce and civilization are sponsored and supported by this energy which man in one sense at least has learned to "make felt" effectively. One may remember Shelley's persistent interest in a truly humanized technology in a world redeemed by the twin genii of science and poetry. In the last stanza the poet sums up his experience and tries to ex plain. We first look back up at the mountain which "yet gleams on high," as it has through much of the examination of the workings of the forces seemingly set in motion by it. There are apparently two worlds, one an inaccessible world of power, a secret strength, repre sented as a serene and supernal light and the other the mutable and perhaps dependent world of the senses. Bearing in mind Shelley's warn ing elsewhere ("Essay on Christianity"), "Where indefiniteness ends idolatry and anthropomorphism begin," one yet must ask, How may the power be related to the apparent product? Up there snows fall, winds "contend," lightning flares forth though "none beholds them there." The winds are not heard. The lightning is "voiceless." Process occurs constantly but silently, without auditor or spectator, in a ghostly or violent play of elements eternally going on. Following this brooding voiceless lightning, this continuing emphasis on silence and solitude,21 following these currents of image and implication and mystery comes the strong voice of the poet proposing his own sibylline solution of the riddle. In fact, he, having learned much perhaps of "awful doubt," offers an exclamation and a question rather than expository declarations. 21. One may be reminded of the situation in Prometheus Unbound?"A voice unspoken," ir, i. 191, and "A spell is treasured but for thee alone," n, iii, 88.</page><page sequence="15">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 325 The secret Strength of things Which governs thought, and to the infinite dome Of Heaven is as a law, inhabits thee! All three words?"secret," "Strength," and "things"?are important to the poem, "secret" occurring in lines 4, 17, and 122; "strength" or "power" in lines 16, 96, 127; and "things"?"universe of things" in lines 1 and 40. Later, as Wasserman suggests, the secrets may become Demogorgon, "the Power that releases its normal processes into the realm of life when the mind bends its will into passive admission of them."22 This secret strength "inhabits" the gleaming mountain, an unknowable immanence whose manifestations or workings may be ob served. It "governs," says Shelley, echoing the ironic humanizing and mythicizing his "imaginings" have discovered throughout the poem, both thought and "the infinite dome / Of Heaven." Commentators have been reminded of Spinoza here, and reasonably enough, given Spinoza's concept of the one reality revealed in the twin attributes of thought and extension. This poem lacks Spinozist confidence in its own system, however. Shelley tends to stress a distinction between the vast impersonal power and the frail, fantasy-making, value-assigning poet laboring to define and "tame" the mysterious wildness. The secret re mains a secret, and the human yearning for a clearly defined and ob jective unity, order, and purpose must be frustrated, a point reinforced by the exclamations of the stanza. Ultimate meanings can't be explicitly defined in poetry or philosophy though we may indeed sense, as Nor throp Frye says of poetry generally, "an orbit or circumference of meaning" which allows considerable "latitude for varieties of interpre tation and emphasis."23 And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea, If to the human mind's imaginings Silence and solitude were vacancy? The bewildering experience projects the human agent into a strange state, a "separate fantasy," of silence and solitude, where he may im agine, somewhat too freely, a world without meaning or purpose other than that assigned to it by his will and imagination. What would be the status in reality of the mountain, the whole earth, the remote stars, and the distant sea?all basically non-human prospects and seemingly 22. Wasserman, p. 318. 23.

The word "imaginings" may not suggest much stabili ty, and the images of the final stanza and of the poem as a whole have defined an objective world of power, control, continuing process inde pendent of any perceiver or "imaginer." Nevertheless an imagining, a structure of symbols and ideas within the mind or expressing the struc ture of the mind, as for example a poem or other work of art, neces sarily mediates between mind and outer experience. A good many commentators see the final question as affirming faith in the imagination,24 or as emphasizing the need for a percipient in telligence striving to understand the way the Idea manifests itself in reality. The "deeper reality" has meaning only because the human imagination bridges a gap between the perceived and the ideal. Pro fessor Kapstein very acutely analyzes the tone as revealing the "ironic attitude of a slave towards his master." The master's power is insigni ficant without the labor of the worker-interpreter. Kapstein shows this stance to be an interesting analogy to Shelley's revolutionary political attitudes.25 As Dr. Boe paraphrases the question: "What would the 'power' and all its phenomenal manifestations be if 'Silence and soli tude' [the transcendent] were vacancy [nonexistent, meaningless] to the creative power of the Imagination, the power of the human mind which does penetrate beyond experience to the reality behind it?"26 The an swer would have to be, when the passage is so paraphrased, I presume, that the imagined vacancy would be real vacancy. However, it may be that the poem hasn't expressed a philosophy so much as it has described a process of imaginative experience leading to an ironic judgment about its possible meaning. It has warned against philosophies, reli gions, beliefs as dangerous to wisely passive awareness. Perhaps the final question confirms the ironies active in the development of the poem. The basic method of the poem is an ironic examination of apparent oppositions, for irony is hospitable to a variety, even a conflict of views. Clear and precise knowledge, something separate from the process of knowing, is unattainable. Hence "Mont Blanc" itself demonstrates the value of poetry as a way of knowing relatively free from the passion for secure and stable knowledge. We have a notion of a power which can be channeled meaningfully, which seems to be a force of law, a Necessity governing both mind and nature, subject and object. The 24.

Where there's no observer or imaginer, obviously there's no meaning, since meaning depends on interpretation; but because of the actual puzzling experience available and contended with in a "Mont Blanc," it must be acknowledged that men can attain by imagination a sense of out ward power or potentiality which should inform and discipline all value systems. The final question reminds us then, following the visions ot terror, ruin, death, remoteness, the mixture of turbulence and gleaming silence in the last three stanzas, that we should sustain our stance of cautious and subtle searching, feeling that there may be a kind or source of power or energy in the universe of things but that the world of thought must create value, purpose, and direction. Systems and assur ances ought to be continually corrected by reference to the possible world of power beyond knowing. The emphasis is on enduring difficulty and struggle.27 The laws of nature are in a very real sense laws of mind, for they are known, concatenated, and interpreted by mind, meaning by mind the "imaginative configurations" (Wasserman's phrase) created by great poets. Necessity or Power governs both mind and nature, but mind as the value-seeking, judgment-making, myth-creating partner can transcend impersonal process. It may be part of the operation of Necessity that it excite the mind to discovery of the presence and power of Necessity in the universe, but "the mind by reflection upon the data of sense comes to the assignment of meaning and so creates knowl edge."28 A somewhat ironic question may, however, be the only com pletely honest way to end a poetic declaration of independence from nature. "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty"29 seems a simpler and more positive 27. Vivian, pp. 64-5. 28. Kapstein, pp. 1058-9. I have made considerable use of all the excellent studies previously cited in weaving together these notes towards the interpreta tion of the conclusion of "Mont Blanc," but I am particularly indebted to Kap stein and Wasserman. I must here apologize for mangling and misusing Professor Kapstein's subtle argument in my book on Shelley. An error in my notes seems to have led me, quite inexcusably, to use one of his suppositions to demolish a second, as I discovered in reviewing his excellent article for this study. 29. Chernaik (pp. 185, 189) points out that the "Hymn" was apparently conceived during the Geneva trip with Byron in June of 1816 and that "Mont Blanc" was probably composed at the time of the journey to the mountain in July.</page><page sequence="18">328 GERALD McNIECE poem than"Mont Blanc." It is a revolutionary "Hymn," incorporating attitudes, symbols, and patterns from the religious politics of the French Revolution. The work of an agnostic but fideistic revolutionary, a skeptical but optimistic idealist, it also borrows images and ideas from formal religion and theology. So complex a mixture of modes and in fluences would suggest that irony will again, as in "Mont Blanc," be active in adjusting and balancing the perspectives of the poem. In tellectual beauty is described as a properly mysterious and perhaps even capricious deity, very well suited to the stance of "awful doubt" or mild faith adopted by a seeker for ideal personal and socio-political forms, who recognizes that value is something created as much as dis covered, who tries to create a passion for man-mending, who labors to liberate his readers from the obvious slaveries of dark and destructive creeds. He begins the poem by describing intellectual beauty30 as an "unseen Power" whose shadowy manifestation "Floats though unseen among us." Rather than the "Mont Blanc" image of a nature channeling its way through the passive senses into the mind, the poet now speaks of delicate, subtle, evanescent sensations. As Mrs. Chernaik says, the poet's knowledge of intellectual beauty is achieved, not by a Platonic intellec tual discipline but by a Christian process of prayer, petition, vision.31 Indeed the nature of the relationship between mind and the Power constitutes the major irony of the "Hymn." The visits are "inconstant" as if the Power were toying with us. Prayers, ritual charms, and sacri fices must be offered to persuade the fickle Power to remain. Why is it inconstant? What kind of world does such inconstancy create for us? 30. The term "intellectual beauty," which Shelley also used to translate Plato's supreme form in his version of The Symposium, must have been fairly common at the time. I have myself noted it in Godwin's Memoirs of Mary Woll stonecraft, ed. W. Clark Durant (London: Constable, 1927), pp. 124-5 and in Blake's "Descriptive Catalogue," Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman (New York: Doubleday, 1965), p. 535. Newman Ivey White (Shelley [London: Seeker &amp; Warburg, 1974], i, 701) points out that Wieland's Agathon, a work Shelley liked, uses "beaute intellectuelle." Given such apparent currency, it may be that Chernaik (p. 58) and Wasserman (p. 191) discover more intention in the word "intellectual" than it is necessary to assume. Both seem to suggest that Shelley implies a divinity of mind only and an identification of existence with mind, the "beauty" being an apprehension of intellect rather than sense. The distinction might lead one to overlook the objective and political potentialities which Shelley suggests, both here and in "Mont Blanc," that the Power might have. In his notebook Coleridge uses the phrase "perfect Intellec tual Beauty or Wholeness" (Notebooks, ed. Kathleen H. Coburn, Item #2012). 31. Chernaik, pp. 33, 36.</page><page sequence="19">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 329 The poet implores the Power to sustain its shadow presence. Both "visit" and "inconstant" are repeated. He compares its appearances in nature and mind to various impalpable, evanescent, and yet unde niably sensory phenomena, sensory phenomena, however, which only the most attuned and "adverting" perceivers could welcome and lament. Like aught that for its grace may be Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery. The theological possibilities of "grace" and "mystery" support Shelley's intuition of writing a hymn to the source of truest revolutionary ardor, the sense of beauty and power which nurtures the ideals of love, liberty, and equality. Shelley, later to make a rigorous distinction in "The Defence of Poet ry" between what one knows and what one can communicate, reveals some of the foundation for his distinction in these exploratory lyric passages. In experience we can dimly sense meanings and feelings which our abstract symbols must distort in communication. The transient pres ence, this ameliorating "grace," is "yet dearer" for an elusiveness which enhances life with a quality of richly meaningful mystery. The mutable visits of beauty make life more intense and significant, perhaps because they are mutable. The sentiment is Wordsworthian, or rather it is a central theme of the "Intimations" ode, Keats's "Melancholy," and a good many other poems besides. Clearly the presence is "dearer" than unmysterious natural religion and the ruling necessity which had been the apex of Shelley's religion in Queen Mab. The passage underlines a central change of attitude occurring in Shelley's thought. Mutability must be accepted as a central mystery. If we lived unremittingly in the presence of beauty, the responsiveness to beauty might be blurred and lost. The sense of such a presence is the source of religious creeds as well as of poems. An argument borrowed from traditional theodicy is here converted to the purposes of a revolutionary and agnostic huma nism, a humanism which dallies with hypostasizing, which can't relin quish the "inextinguishable thirst for immortality." In Stanza II the questioning continues. The power, identified as the "Spirit of Beauty" which consecrates, makes sacred with its presence, its "own hues," all that it shines on thus inconstantly, is now imagined mainly in light-darkness terms. The poet speaks as if this presence/ power were now, as it is so often, absent. Our state, this life, a "dim vast vale of tears," seems to be left "vacant and desolate" by its disappear ance. Both "vacant" and "vast" are "Mont Blanc" dictions, and the</page><page sequence="20">330 GERALD McNIEGE problem of determining what to make of a "diminished thing," a uni verse seemingly emptied of meaning when our "imaginings" dwindle, is the "Mont Blanc" problem. Why does the presence, the "thou" of visionary poetry, "pass away"? It is the question of all the great Ro mantic odes. Why must the alternation of love and desolation, as Shel ley is to put the problem in Prometheus Unbound, consume the hopes of man? But, it is realized, such questions merely ask once more the basic question: why change, death, ugliness in a space-time world (questions we are doomed by our nature and situation to ask eternally and in every possible form) ? Man oscillates from love to hate, despon dency to hope. A theologian would inquire into the connection between God's being and purpose and man's suffering and evil. What can a skeptical idealist poet find to justify the universal wavering, a poet here using religious language and stances ironically as he labors to divine and winnow out the element true to human experience and discard the dogmas, creeds, and "poisonous names" that "desolate" man employs to shield himself from "vacancy"? Stanza III reflects the negative polemics of the younger Shelley who attacked established religion as the bulwark of tryanny and the enemy of the searching imagination. He dismisses the "vain endeavour" of earlier aspirants to answer the central question. Whatever may be claimed, no god has given "sage or poet" the ultimate answer to the problem of value, though some have invented charms or spells like "Demon, Ghost, and Heaven" (or Christ, the Holy Spirit, and God the Father) to exorcise the despair caused by "Doubt, chance, and muta bility." If we could but find the right name, God's holy name (they seem to think), then He might respond and explain. But such hard-to avoid presumptions are banished by the "awful doubt" or mild faith appropriate to our frail and elusive illuminations. The unnameable though real presence or light eludes the defining. Shelley, aware both that "speech created thought" and that "when composition begins, inspiration is on the decline," creates an ironic mode that mixes religion and skepticism to express the rich ambiguity of his moods, insight, and longings, to avoid a certainty he can't honestly feel, and to shape the reactions of a reader who needs to achieve a like readiness and flexi bility of the imagination. The lament continues in stanza IV. The humanist and revolutionary virtues?love, hope, self-esteem?are identified and their evanescence deplored. The fact that these virtues are "lent" by intellectual beauty, are only occasional presences, like all excellent things, would seem to make self-esteem, the really central revolutionary virtue, difficult to</page><page sequence="21">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 331 sustain. Self-esteem should, one might think, imply an enduring, self generated state. Self-esteem, of course, is replacing the theological virtue of faith, a state traditionally described as lent from above. Faith apparently implies a self-abnegation the poet would avoid. If these virtues were to remain, and the emphasis is not on how they work but how brief and uncertain their presence, man would indeed, like the god earlier dismissed as a "frail spell," be "immortal and omnipotent," would, in short, be rather more than man. It is easy to see how man (and hard not to sympathize with his plight), buffeted and distracted by the whirl of opposites, as Shelley describes him, should develop the passion to believe his creeds, revere the charms and spells he fashions to protect and secure his mind. Perhaps the metaphysical lyrics that Shel ley fashions with his ironic method, featuring "safe" quantities of re ligious allusion and ritual formulae, should themselves be regarded as "vaccination" poems against the disease of traditional faith and ortho doxy. A healthy imagination is exercised by the restless, creative play of oppositions. The power is a "messenger of sympathies" between lovers though the sympathies also "wax and wane." The power nourishes human thought "Like darkness to a dying flame." This image seems to me a brilliant success, summing up dramatically Shelley's central theodicy. Without the darkness, there can be no light. The mind or thought also illumines the darkness, and the ironic possibility is there that the mind endows the chaos and darkness of our world with whatever meaning it may contain. The dying flame prepares, of course, for the final reference in the stanza to the fear of death, when darkness prevails. At this central position of the poem comes the prayer, the plea of the hierophant for the permanent presence of the power. Remain thou! Keep "thy glorious train" firmly within rather than coming and going like the shadow. Without this sense and this hope the grave is final, a "dark reality." "Like life and fear," he says, and the comparisons are grim. One could, in fact, read this poem as much more confident and optimistic than it really is. The poet strives in prayer with the power whose might he would invoke and channel, but uncertainty and inconstancy are his certain and constant themes. And ironically he's probably not sure that he ought not to praise that very uncertainty and inconstancy as sources of growth and vitality. The first four stanzas have developed the idea of a power whose transient visitations lend meaning, beauty, intensity to nature and mind. The poet ends with a prayer that the power be less capricious, more sustaining. Having expressed his fear and having perhaps reproached</page><page sequence="22">332 GERALD McNIECE this inconstant wooer, this undependable source of light, grace, and truth, the poet turns in the clamactic stanzas V and VI to personal na rative. He too has tried to discover the nature of the mystery of exist ence. He has had moments of vision and they have changed his life. Up to this point, the ironic tone has been just right, not quite cheerful, not quite playful. The poem has been distinguished by its wit, by glimpses of subsurface conflicts, by clever imagery and rhyming. It has been a poem thus far very aware of its own art while conveying the sense of bewilderment, frustration, doubt, and loss. Now comes what may be regarded as the central irony. Since his conversion, the poet has main tained perfect constancy to the inconstant power. He too had once been subject to the delusions of other men. In pursuit of illuminating inter views with "departed dead," he tried to summon their ghosts with "poisonous names," Christian names presumably, the frail spells and charms of the faith he was reared to believe in. Like the efforts of "sage or poet" of stanza III, this was "vain endeavour." However the searching and "musing" process was productive, made his mind open and receptive to meaning, like Wordworth's boy of Winander for whom "the visible scene / Would enter unawares into his mind." The shadow of the power did suddenly fall on the youth when the renewing winds of early spring brought "News of birds and blossoming." Wasserman suggests that Shelley had a profound and "authentic epiphanic experience" which "fixed a governing psychological pat tern."32 Moreover it happens to a boy, an unusually "fearful" and sensitive boy, as in Whitman's "Out of the Cradle," another poem about a sense of profound meaning and intensity followed by a dedica tion as binding as a religious vow. Shelley dedicates his poetic powers to the cause of man. He becomes an evangelist, he suggests, a missionary in the service of this religion of humanity and intellectual beauty, and he assures us that he has remained constant to his vow. The hours can testify to his service both as a lover and a philosopher, hours spent so intensely in his "visioned bowers" as to make the night envious. They know that never joy illumed my brow Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free This world from its dark slavery, That thou?O awful LOVELINESS, Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express. 32. Wasserman, p. 417.</page><page sequence="23">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 333 The stanza ends with his testimonial of hope that the power of the "awful LOVELINESS" might redeem the world from its "dark slavery." It should be stressed that Shelley in the last two stanzas is affirming the union of his personal and political hopes. The "SPIRIT fair" may be "inconstant" but the dedication is firm. Perhaps this spirit, like the beautiful woman of Petrarchan tradition, holds us by her fickleness and inconstancy. Either the principle is inconstant, and then one seeks explanations for the inconstancy perhaps similar to those offered in the theodicies of conventional religions, or man is inconstant, inhumane to his fellow sufferers, and therefore undeserving of more than brief visits. In the latter case the problem may be partly a socio-political one solved by appropriate education and institutions. After all, firm belief in a transcendent and omnipotent deity wouldn't give one much logical motivation to work hard for the world. Believing simply and restrictedly in an available power/presence which men must engage and direct focuses attention where it belongs, that is, on the real, present, and presumably rectifiable corruptions and inadequacies created by the blindness and inertia of men. Shelley perhaps anticipates, here and in "Mont Blanc," the later nineteenth-century descriptions of a world of blind will or chance, of purposeless evolution, the kind of vision which liberated men of insight from subjection to an illusioned concept of harmonious and purposive nature so that they might create the human value worlds?aesthetic, ethical, political. Thus one arrives at Shelley's peculiarly ironic divinity?a presence scarcely to be trusted, barely to be named allusively, yet a source and a kind of personality which one may pray to and attempt to invoke. Or alternatively, per haps such a god can be made real and constant only by our convictions and actions. Meaning is created or strengthened by belief and activity. Like Blake, Shelley may affirm, "All deities reside in the human breast." Neither poet was prepared to leave the matter there, but to go beyond this danger point and to guess at the tendencies and implications of more mysterious and delicate sensitivities was, for Shelley, at least, to try to say what "words cannot express." In the last stanza the poet contemplates his own aging, welcomes the mellowness, "calm," and maturity of adulthood. There is to be something "more solemn and serene" perhaps than the revolutionary ardors and personal passions which burned so strongly in the poet. In voking this "harmony" and "lustre," suggesting a career of steady and significant service to humanity, he then makes his final prayer to the power of intellectual beauty which earlier descended on his "passive</page><page sequence="24">334 GERALD McNIECE youth" like the "truth / Of nature." One is reminded of Words worth's themes in "Tintern Abbey," the "Intimations" ode, and "The Ode to Duty." Shelley considers the process of his own maturing and insists on the constancy of his dedication to the power he serves (per haps alluding to the falling away of Wordsworth himself, as Shelley described it in his sonnet to the poet a year before). He asks, like Words worth in "Elegiac Stanzas," for "calm" rather than intensity, the calm intrinsic to this power from above, unlike man fevered by the inten sities of his conflicts. Here is a profoundly sophisticated worshipper, no longer reproaching his deity for caprice, who now requests the serene steadiness of purpose and spirit which will support a life of stable service to all the forms of intellectual beauty. The last stanza and the poem as a whole serve as an excellent preface to the remarkable productions to come from Shelley in the next six years. Intellectual beauty is addressed finally as a "SPIRIT fair," a mighty breath of being, itself a creator of spells, though not presum ably like those "frail spells" mortals create. By these spells, these enthral ments, he has been bound to "fear himself," that is, to regard with numinous awe the spirit kindred to beauty within himself awaiting de liverance, perhaps the dread power in him to lead men through his imaginings, as at the end of "West Wind." It is a kind of religious fear, but compatible with "Self-esteem." It also binds him to the con tinuing service of the potential beauty within "all human kind," await ing liberation from dark slaveries with the help of the redeeming poet. Thus again, at the end, the theme of united personal and political hopes is confirmed. In both of these transitional poems the poet presents a dramatic account of himself in the process of seeking among shadows for a power/presence which can validate the efforts of hopeful visionaries to reform the world. I have frequently used the term "irony" in describing the method of the poems. Irony seems appropriate to a writer involved in so uncertain and elusive a quest as the search for true concepts of mind, nature, and society. Shelley needed to explore and debate, to inquire into foundations, to avoid dogmatic commitments to fixed creeds, modern or ancient, without sacrificing the sustaining energy of a modified, subtle, and various revolutionary faith. Irony is a way to study one's own self-divisions as well as to balance opposite claims to truth. Irony is a mode of active thinking suited to a poetry of ideas, concerned to discover or create meaning by giving form to its own pro cesses of weighing and considering oppositions.</page><page sequence="25">SHELLEY AS IRONIST 335 Shelley remains the hostile critic of organized religion, an "atheist," though he uses the stances and images of worship to create a new religion suited to the making of poetry or lively meaning. Both poems reflect a similar social and political commitment, though "Mont Blanc" reveals the process towards it, while the "Hymn" reviews the processes of value-seeking from a comparatively achieved position. The "Hymn" is a much more framed and ordered poem, is appropriately called a hymn, that is, a medium for worship, though now worship of a power not fully perceived or understood in a religion requiring the subtler medium of poetry for approaching its intangible and evanescent ob jects. It is the right kind of hymn for the power glimpsed in "Mont Blanc," a power which clearly needs structuring and modulating to be an effective ingredient in a genuinely open humanism. In "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," the "unseen" power is not reflected in a single prominent symbol, like the visible reality of the great ambivalent moun tain. Rather the poet focuses on the psychological states of the wor shipper, his hopes and despairs, his awareness of the curves and oscil lations in experience. "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty" complains partic ularly about the inconstancy of an ultimate principle, but both poems describe the dangers of "frail spells"?constancies and fixities?in con ventional religion and politics. "Mont Blanc" is not a prayer, but a tough-minded description of the human situation in a world recalcitrant to value-making. "Mont Blanc" reveals the appallingly natural, that is, non-human world, from which we must protect our ideas of purpose though we return to it for disci pline and renewal. The "Hymn" is set within a mind which has made some discoveries of importance and now examines the relation between mind and the values it serves by exploring freshly earned significances. "Mont Blanc" is phenomenological analysis; the "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty" is a deliberate structure for examining the implications of the human sense of transcendence. The imagery and ideas of both poems reflect a view of poetry as a process of self-organization which weaves into its dialectic an investigation of the relations between Power and Intellectual Beauty, between the natural and human worlds, between the forms of strength and light and the passing show of death and change. Ultimately one is impressed, perhaps even depressed, in Shelley's poems, by his insistence on the poet's burden and responsibility as both diviner and creator for the new religion of humanity which must suc ceed the banished gods of the past. The poet must be an enormously hard-working god, never permitted to rest with a "Behold, it was very</page><page sequence="26">336 GERALD McNIECE good," but condemned to eternal labor, suffering, and creation lest men, himself included, worship the creator, the process, or the product rather than be guided freely by the restless and continual "imaginings" generated by the quest for value. The new religion, its sanctuary within the mind of man, requires a subtler, more ironic medium than the old rituals and spells for approaching its evanescent objects, but it requites its novices with ever-brightening gleams from the shadows of love and beauty unbeheld.
