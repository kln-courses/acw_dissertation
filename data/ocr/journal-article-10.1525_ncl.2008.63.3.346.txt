Do not seek happiness in what is misnamed  pleasure; seek it rather in what is termed study. Keep your con- science clear, your curiosity fresh, and embrace every opportu- nity of cultivating your minds. You will gain nothing by attending  Chartist meetings. The fellows who speak nonsense with fl uency  at these assemblies, and deem their nonsense eloquence, are to- tally unable to help either you or themselves. . . .

But as the passage moves toward  a list of the objects that working-men might study—“stones  and weeds, and the most familiar animals”—natural history  emerges as Miller’s preferred alternative to Chartism. That  branch of science had become synonymous by the 1830s with  the study of plants, animals, and minerals, all objects that Hugh  Miller describes as the “commonest things” in one’s immediate  surroundings. The idea that working-class men might supplant  politics with natural history, that they might “learn to make  a right use of [their] eyes,” gathered momentum during the  1840s, the decade during which both the “condition of Eng- land” debates and the popularity of natural history continued  to escalate. Miller’s writings on the subject represent one point  in a constellation of works that characterizes natural history as  the most reliable and responsible route for the working classes  to “better their circumstances.” Nowhere in that constellation  of works, however, are the Chartist and the Naturalist more  sharply defi ned as the twin possibilities for working-class men  than in Elizabeth Gaskell’s Mary Barton (1848). Mary Barton, written a few years after the publication of  Miller’s The Old Red Sandstone, offsets the violent energies of  John Barton, a politically conscious Chartist, by introducing  Job Legh, a working-class naturalist who prefers insects and  plants to politics.3 Gaskell identifi es in working-class natural  2 Hugh Miller, The Old Red Sandstone; or, New Walks in an Old Field (Edinburgh: John  Johnstone, 1841), pp. 1–2. 3 See Kathleen Tillotson, Novels of the Eighteen-Forties (Oxford: Clarendon Press,  1954). Although critics often treat Job Legh as peripheral to the two central plotlines  of Mary Barton, Tillotson has astutely noted that Job “is more than a minor character;  he is the point of rest in the narrative” (Novels of the Eighteen-Forties, p. 219). I build on  Tillotson’s claims for Job’s importance, and I also borrow Alex Woloch’s assertion that  minor characters are continually “jostl[ing] for limited space within the same fi ctive  universe” as the “main” characters of a literary work (Woloch, The One Vs.

As such, Gaskell’s naturalist  represents less a solution for those readers grappling with class- based antipathies than a solution to the ethical conundrums  that the fi rst-time novelist encountered when imagining re- alistic, but nonviolent, working-class characters. But Gaskell’s  complex representation of naturalist discourse introduces an  important wrinkle to her seemingly perfect characterological  solution: the technical language of natural history, which re- peatedly interrupts the novel’s fl uid discourse and occludes  conversation between different characters, limited the subject’s  popular accessibility. In contrast to vociferous claims that the  relatively simple Linnaean system had democratized science  (claims that still persist in present-day accounts of Victorian  natural history), Gaskell’s fi ction offers a compelling critique  of even the simplest form of classical nomenclature and the  classifi catory logic it produced. The working-class naturalist is,  therefore, a paradox for Gaskell: on the one hand, she imagines  that the language and structure of formal science permit the  naturalist’s intellectual extension throughout the broad public  sphere of English science; on the other hand, she imagines for- mal science to be exclusive and alienating among the working- class characters in the novel, particularly women. Natural his- tory thus appears in Mary Barton as a sign of liberation from  class constraints, a way of connecting amateurs to a potentially  global community of scientists and fostering their knowledge of  distant locales. At the same time, however, naturalist knowledge  is shown to liberate only those who have access to the elaborate  systems of classifi cation that came to defi ne natural history as  science during the 1840s. Gaskell’s reservations about systematic forms of scientifi c  knowledge and classifi catory logic also had surprising implica- Press, 2003], p. 13). My reading diverges from Amy Mae King’s analysis of Mary Bar- ton, which argues that Job Legh models a perceptual mode that Gaskell envisions as a  corrective to “the wrongs of misclassifi cation” that have resulted in social violence (see  King, “Taxonomical Cures: The Politics of Natural History and Herbalist Medicine in  Elizabeth Gaskell’s Mary Barton,” in Romantic Science: The Literary Forms of Natural His- tory, ed.

Mary Barton acknowledges  that Job Legh’s approach to the study and representation of  organic life parallels the novelist’s own systematic approach to  working-class characters. This approach, which has been inter- preted as proto-anthropological, is instead drawn from natu- ral history.4 At fi rst, I argue, Gaskell indulges the classifi catory  logic and empirical modes of analysis that systematic naturalists  employed during the 1840s. But as she begins to modify these  rigid epistemologies, she returns to an older, non-classifi catory  form of natural history that describes the environmental condi- tions that affect behavior. That older form, which is concerned  more with habits and habitats than with classifi cation, uses nar- rative strategies to establish the “history” of a particular set of  behaviors. Although this older form was rendered obsolete in  the mid-century scientifi c world by increasing pressures to pro- fessionalize natural history (or, as Michel Foucault insists in The  Order of Things, by an episteme organized around classifi cation  and naming), I argue that it remained alive in the form of the  British novel.5 By identifying a connection between Gaskell’s  explanations for human behavior and these narrative forms  of natural history, I seek in this essay to re-place her fi ction  within the scientifi c discourses that shaped it, while hinting at  the deep interconnections that existed more broadly between  novel writing and natural history in Victorian Britain. When Job Legh is fi rst introduced in the  fi fth chapter of Mary Barton, the narrator dwells on the appear- ance of the “little wiry-looking old man,” pausing to describe  4 See James Buzard, Disorienting Fiction: The Autoethnographic Work of Nineteenth- Century British Novels (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 2005), p. 46. 5 See Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York:  Vintage Books, 1970). Foucault argues that this older, narrative mode of natural his- tory was displaced by the classifi catory forms of that science during the eighteenth cen- tury, with the establishment of the Linnaean system. In the larger project from which  this essay is drawn, I build on the work of Lynn Merrill, Barbara T. Gates, and others to  argue that these narrative forms persist in the Victorian period and continually inform  the production of realist fi ction.

Appar- ently unhampered by the demands of his work as a spinner,  Job has acquired knowledge by studying his “impaled insects”  and “cabalistic books” at home (Mary Barton, p. 40). Similarly,  Samuel Smiles’s Self-Help (1859) describes a group of “young  men of the humblest rank” in Leeds who learned “reading  and writing, arithmetic and geography; and even mathemat- ics, chemistry, and . . . modern languages” in garden hovels  (p. iv). These young men, memorialized in the preface to the  fi rst edition of Self-Help, proved to be both the inspiration for  and the emblems of the ethic of self-help promulgated by the  book. Featuring prominently in a chapter entitled “Helps and  Opportunities: Scientifi c Pursuits,” of course, is Hugh Miller,  the stonemason who discovered geological worlds by breaking  rocks apart in the quarry, and who urged working-class men to  orient their energies toward self-improvement instead of politi- cal action. Although Miller proved to be a near-perfect representative  of self-help for Smiles, one critical fl aw marred his exemplarity  and drew attention to a glaring contradiction at the heart of  Self-Help: Miller’s dramatic rise from stonemason to geologist of  high professional status. If self-help were to be pursued without  regard for material outcome, then citing extremely successful  men presented a logical conundrum.7 To avoid this contradic- tion, Smiles’s future elaborations of the self-help ethic would  be built around “the humblest human life,” the working-class  6 Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life, ed. Macdonald Daly  (London: Penguin, 1996), p. 40. Further references are to this edition and appear in  the text. 7 Smiles included this all-important caveat in Self-Help to assuage the contradiction:  “Self-culture may not, however, end in eminence, as in the numerous instances above  cited. The great majority of men, in all times, however enlightened, must necessarily be  engaged in the ordinary avocations of industry” (Self-Help, p. 261). It should be noted  that, unlike Smiles, Hugh Miller was very conscious of the fact that “the self-improving  working man had absolutely no guarantee of any sort of success, whether mental or  material” (David Vincent, “Miller’s Improvement: A Classic Tale of Self-Advancement?”  in Hugh Miller and the Controversies of Victorian Science, ed.

In his late writings on Thomas Ed- ward, for example, Smiles emphasizes the naturalist’s enduring  material impoverishment: “[Edward] was a shoemaker then; he  is a shoemaker still. For nearly thirty years he has fought the  battle of scientifi c poverty. He was one of those men who lived  for science, not by science” (Life of a Scotch Naturalist, p. v). Smiles  concluded that the pursuit of scientifi c knowledge only becomes  a form of self-help when it is fully dissociated from professional  aspirations and material ambitions. According to this logic, work- ing-class naturalists could use their knowledge symbolically to  bridge class divisions and participate in a larger scientifi c com- munity without actually improving their material conditions. In  so doing, they represented a necessarily provisional form of so- cial mobility that left prevailing hierarchies intact. This fi ction  of mobility—one form of what I call traveling in one place— is at the root of working-class natural history in Mary Barton. The idea of a self-helping naturalist capable of provisional  travel would prove useful for Gaskell, who struggled with the  volatile subject of her fi rst novel. Superadded to the problems  of authority that she encountered as a woman novelist who had  not yet established her narrative voice was the risky project of  representing working-class suffering to middle-class readers.9 In  the preface to Mary Barton, Gaskell tried to counterbalance her  ethical impulse to “give some utterance to the agony which . . .  convulses this dumb people” with her declaration of concern  for the “unhappy state of things between . . . the employers  and the employed” (Mary Barton, p. 3). Gaskell understood,  8 See Samuel Smiles, The Life of a Scotch Naturalist: Thomas Edward (London: John  Murray, 1876), p. v. 9 On Gaskell’s narrative voice, see Hilary M.

The short biography of James Crowther that appeared in  Chambers’ Edinburgh Journal in 1847 specifi cally describes the  “important effects” that natural history had “in bringing men of  different classes together on a footing of equality, which must  tend to make the social machine the fi rmer in its joinings” ( James  Crowther,” p. 217). Similarly, in Mary Barton, Job’s knowledge  10 Lesjak, Working Fictions: A Genealogy of the Victorian Novel (Durham, N.C.: Duke  Univ.

Hughes and Michael Lund, Victorian Pub- lishing and Mrs. Gaskell’s Work (Charlottesville: Univ. of Virginia Press, 1999). 12 See Anne Secord, “Elizabeth Gaskell and the Artisan Naturalists of Manchester,”  Gaskell Society Journal, 19 (2005), 34–51. Secord claims that Gaskell may have drawn  instead from the original accounts of James Crowther that fi rst appeared in the Man- chester Guardian in 1843 (“Elizabeth Gaskell,” p. 44). Whether Gaskell read the 1843  article or the later 1847 memorial biography of Crowther, it is more important for my  account that she was familiar with the cultural reception of Crowther’s engagement in  natural history. Her familiarity is made evident by the novel’s specifi c mention of an  incident that involved Crowther and J. E. Smith (see Mary Barton, p. 39). 13 [Anon.], “James Crowther, the Naturalist,” Chambers’ Edinburgh Journal, 7  (1847), 215.

I know one, Mr Cheshire, who’s  rather given to th’ insect line—and a good kind o’ chap. He  and I have swopped specimens many’s the time, when either  of us had a duplicate” (Mary Barton, p. 260). If the “social ma- chine” breaks down in Mary Barton as the result of failed com- munications between factory owners and operatives, then Job  Legh is the only one in the novel who facilitates its smooth  function. Moreover, the connections that form among fellow  naturalists are directly responsible for the felicitous progres- sion of the Mary Barton/Jem Wilson plotline, since Job’s re- lationship with Mr. Cheshire helps him secure a reliable and  sympathetic attorney for Jem. One of the narrative functions of  Job as a naturalist, then, is to allow for the seamless integration  of working-class characters into a legal plot. Job’s familiarity  with Mr. Cheshire, an outgrowth of the bonds thought to form  among naturalists across class lines during the 1840s, makes  compatible the nearly destitute working-class characters and  the abstract workings of the legal system in a believable way. Job’s study of natural history not only permits his travel  to a new social domain shared by lawyers and other profes- sionals, but it also enables his virtual movement to new geo- graphical locations. In referencing his desire to collect earwigs  from Canada, fl ying fi sh from Madeira, and scorpions from the  “East Indies,” the novel also alludes to the naturalist’s fi gura- tive travel to distant locales. When Job’s granddaughter Marga- ret recounts the “tale of the scorpion” to her new friend Mary  Barton, she explains precisely how Job collects his specimens  14 In Charlotte Brontë’s Shirley (1849) natural history serves as a common intel- lectual ground for characters in different class positions, as Alan Rauch has noted (see  Rauch, Useful Knowledge: The Victorians, Morality, and the March of Intellect [Durham, N.C.:  Duke Univ. Press, 2001], p. 136). Unlike Gaskell, however, Brontë does not envision  the kinds of unevenness and contradiction that scientifi c knowledge is shown to pro- duce within the working-class community of Mary Barton.

Margaret  describes her grandfather “strolling about the docks” in order  to “pick up what he could from the sailors, who often bring  some queer thing or another from the hot countries they go  to” (Mary Barton, p. 41). According to Margaret, whenever Job  sees a young sailor with a “druggist’s physic-bottle,” he asks to  see it and knows, when nobody else does, precisely what it con- tains. On one occasion, she explains, Job asked to see what was  in one such bottle and, upon looking at it, “knew it was a rare  kind o’ scorpion, not common even in the East Indies where  the man came from” (p. 41). Though Job remains in Manches- ter while studying a scorpion extracted from India, he man- ages to achieve the mode of “cosmopolitan parochialism” that  Tobias Menely has found in Gilbert White’s The Natural History  of Selborne (1789).15 Menely disputes the common misconcep- tion of White as a static localist by emphasizing the parson’s  positioning of his own region within the global natural system  of which he had become aware by “reading travelogues, exam- ining foreign specimens, comparing notes with other natural- ists, and practicing Linnaean taxonomy” (“Traveling in Place,”  p. 48). Similarly, Job attains a stay-at-home cosmopolitanism by  collecting specimens from colonial territories without actually  traveling anywhere.16 Job’s virtual travel to different social positions and geo- graphical locations, vis-à-vis the study of natural history, was  a common enough trope in other writings of the period. But  Mary Barton is unique in directly connecting that (fi ctive) mo- 15 See Tobias Menely, “Traveling in Place: Gilbert White’s Cosmopolitan Parochial- ism,” Eighteenth-Century Life, 28, no. 3 (2004), 46 –65. 16 Though it is not the focus of my reading, the imperialist logic of this passage  should not be ignored. The novel metonymically substitutes the “poisonous and vi- cious species” of scorpion for India, effectively remaking the colony as a dangerous or  even deadly form of exoticism that threatens to intrude on English domestic spaces  (Mary Barton, p. 41). The narrative simultaneously uses the fi gure of the naturalist to  render the intruder knowable and inert: Job boils the scorpion alive and preserves it in  a gin-fi lled specimen bottle, where it will stand in the Legh household as a sign of the  British naturalist’s mastery of the insect and the terrain from which it hails. Job’s quest  for knowledge is thus double-edged: in one sense, his impulse to collect specimens  from “hot countries” initiates a potentially dangerous form of contact between England  and its colonial territories that could be disastrous for English domesticity. In another  sense, however, his collecting enables his exertion of control over that threat.

By focusing on the fl ora  and fauna of distant locales, and by studying the objects he  trades with Mr. Cheshire, Job avoids seeing what transpires in  his own environment. The tribute to James Crowther in Cham- bers’ celebrates this phenomenon by proudly declaring: “[Natu- ral history] seems to have the irresistible effect of abstracting  the mind from all that is gross and sordid” (“James Crowther,”  p. 217). Indeed, Job is too preoccupied with his study of the  natural world, too absorbed in his books and specimens to ru- minate for very long on what is so deeply emblazoned in John  Barton’s mind: “children born on wet fl ags, without a rag t’  cover ’em or a bit o’ food for th’ mother; . . . folk lying down to  die i’ th’ streets, or hiding their want i’ some hole o’ a cellar till  death come to set ’em free; . . . all this plague, pestilence, and  famine” (Mary Barton, p. 89). In these passages the novel stages  a curious reversal of the naturalist’s alignment with empiri- cism by casting John Barton as the unbending empiricist and  Job Legh as the abstract and theoretical thinker. While Barton  foregrounds his immediate experience, as in the passage above  or others in which he explains his violent indignation in terms  of what he has observed, Job understands working-class suffer- ing as a sign that the economic system underlying all observ- able phenomena has somehow failed. Thus when the Manchester workers voice the concerns  that they would like John Barton to express in London on their  behalf, Job insists that government policy is to blame for slug- gish trade and, consequently, for the sufferings of the working  classes: “Yo take my advice, John Barton, and ask Parliament to  set trade free, so as workmen can earn a decent wage, and buy  their two, ay and three, shirts a year; that would make weaving  brisk” (Mary Barton, p. 88). Job’s interpretation of the suffering  textile workers depends on his understanding of the relation- ship between government policy and the economy rather than  on an analysis of the empirically observable relations between  owners and operatives. Job’s study of nature had taught him to  “make a right use of [his] eyes,” thereby redirecting any ener- gies that might have led to class-based political activism, just as  Hugh Miller in The Old Red Sandstone promised it would.

Instead of seeking the vote as  the Chartists who marched on London, he expresses the same  laissez-faire sentiment endorsed by the poetry of Ebenezer El- liott, the “rhyming spokesman for the Anti-Corn-Law League,” 17  whose poems appear in four chapter epigraphs of Mary Barton. Gaskell was not the only one to imagine that working- class naturalists vigorously supported free trade and shared the  laissez-faire sentiments of many factory owners. In Elijah Rid- ings’s poem “My Uncle Tum” (1854), another impoverished  weaver-naturalist (the uncle of the unidentifi ed narrator) cries  out against restricted trade in much the same manner as Job: And of free trade he’d say ’Egad! ‘They must be either drunk or mad, ‘Or stricken with teetotal blindness, ‘Or destitute of human kindness; ‘The proudest lords of highest station, ‘Starving every one i’th’ nation, ‘Plunging the country into want, ‘Producing nought but dearth and scant.18 Uncle Tum’s laissez-faire argument is accompanied by self- cultivated erudition, as is the case with Job Legh. We are told  that Uncle Tum has “read and studied many a book,” has heard  of “stoic Cato,” “transcendental Plato,” and “battles lost, and  battles won” (“My Uncle Tum,” p. 246), but we also discover  that he is an amateur naturalist. In the stanza that describes his  knowledge of natural history, the narrator is overwhelmed to  the point of speechlessness by the sight of Uncle Tum’s poignant  pursuit of knowledge among the ruins of poverty: At learned botanic club, or meeting, The humble sons of science greeting Each one the other, in that spirit, Which truest wisdom does inherit; Kind, frank, familiar, open, plain, 17 Brian Maidment, The Poorhouse Fugitives: Self-Taught Poets and Poetry in Victorian  Britain (Manchester: Carcanet, 1987), p. 48. 18 Elijah Ridings, “My Uncle Tum,” in Maidment, The Poorhouse Fugitives, p. 247.

Of all of the aspects of Uncle Tum’s life that  the poem recounts, it is the image of the humble man “Study- ing nature’s varied powers” that proves to be most provocative:  on the one hand, it garners the attention of the “carping critic”  who either regards Uncle Tum’s botanizing as an unnecessary  distraction to his work or considers science the province of  gentlemen alone; on the other hand, however, the image is so  powerful and profound that “language faileth” to even capture  it. When the narrator reaches the image of the naturalist who  lives for science and not by science, the poem breaks down and  cannot proceed in its representative act. Gaskell’s novel, by  contrast, locates itself precisely in that lacuna, offering a fuller  representation of the working-class naturalist, and examining  how language does indeed “faileth” around the subject of natu- ral history during the 1840s. Job’s ability to participate in natural history,  and the fi ctional mobility that he derives from the process of  self-cultivation, stem from his command of Latin, the “univer- C5043.indb   357 2/6/09   10:10:44 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> 358 nineteenth-century literature sal” language of science. Job is said not only to be able to recog- nize the plants and insects that he trades with both sailors and  lawyers, but also to name them; thus he is described as “equally  familiar with either the Linnæan or the Natural system” (Mary  Barton, p. 39). Gaskell understood that knowledge of classical  nomenclature made it possible for amateur naturalists work- ing in the periphery to commune with those working in the  “centres of calculation,” that it was necessary to move scientists  beyond the mere exchange of specimens and to participate in- stead in the production of a global knowledge network.19 Latin  was, as many naturalists advertised, precisely what enabled sci- ence to achieve global proportions. Indeed, natural history  periodicals published in England during the 1830s and 1840s  sought an international audience by using Latin phraseology to  target naturalists more or less familiar with English. The Annals  of Natural History, for example, printed long lists of Latin names  alongside substantive articles in English to cater to readers in  London, Paris, Edinburgh, Dublin, and Berlin. The working classes participated in the increasingly global  system of natural history by learning Linnaean Latin together,  in the communal environment of the pub. As historian of sci- ence Anne Secord has argued, the artisan naturalists living  in Manchester during the 1840s gathered to exchange speci- mens, learn the Latin names of those specimens, and socialize  together in the pub context.20 The sociality that these natural- ists enjoyed at their meetings sustained their efforts and helped  them recruit new members into their societies. According to  Secord, it was common practice in these societies to remain  singing and drinking well into the night, long after business had  concluded, which would explain why James Crowther had once  claimed “that specimens always looked ‘best through a glass’ ”  (Secord, “Elizabeth Gaskell,” p. 42). Similarly, Uncle Tum is  described in Ridings’s poem as “imbibing” the “home-brew’d  ale” while “Laughing, joking, jesting, jibing” with the others “in  19 I borrow this phrase from Bruno Latour, Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists  and Engineers through Society (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ.

The revelers  drinking ale alongside Uncle Tum are undoubtedly the same  friends who describe the “genus, species, class” at the “learned  botanic club, or meeting” he regularly attended. Although Gaskell likely learned about the pub context in  which working-class naturalists traded specimens and learned  binomial nomenclature by reading the articles devoted to James  Crowther, her novel radically departs from these popular char- acterizations by detaching Job from the pub context altogether.  As he is stripped from the communal apparatus that would  have aided working-class naturalists in reality, his naturalizing  becomes an asocial act that isolates him within his own commu- nity.21 The fi rst description of the old naturalist thus emphasizes  his withdrawal from social interaction and his inscrutability to  those around him—particularly to Mary Barton, whose bewil- derment upon fi rst meeting Job Legh is conferred onto the  whole scene through free indirect discourse: “the whole room  looked not unlike a wizard’s dwelling. Instead of pictures were  hung rude wooden frames of impaled insects; the little table  was covered with cabalistic books; and beside them lay a case  of mysterious instruments, one of which Job Legh was using  when his granddaughter entered” (Mary Barton, p. 40). Rather  than provide precise details about Job’s books and instruments,  the narrator uses words such as “cabalistic” and “mysterious” to  describe his accoutrements. Gaskell deliberately chose to de- fl ect the realistic description of Job’s scientifi c domain, leaving  readers to identify with Mary Barton in their curiosity about  the nuances of his wizardry. Margaret soon dispels the mystery,  explaining that her “dear grandfather” is “fond of his books,  and his creatures, and his plants. . . . so happy, sorting them  all at home, and so ready to go in search of more, whenever  21 Secord makes a similar observation to advance a different claim. She notes that  Gaskell “went on to portray her fi ctional character Legh as appearing ‘wizard-like’  within his own community, and as a solitary with no like-minded companions,” and  argues that the author did this in order to create “a setting for Legh that she believed  best refl ected his moral virtues” (“Elizabeth Gaskell,” p. 43). Though Secord’s work  provides an indispensable account of the lived experiences of the naturalists on whom  Job Legh is based, her reading of Mary Barton reduces the complexity of Gaskell’s fi c- tional naturalist into a single point about moral virtue.

But just as Mary wonders to herself if  Job even hears any of his granddaughter’s words of praise, the  narrator immediately responds: “but no! he was far too deep  and eager in solving a problem. He did not even notice Mary’s  leave-taking” (p. 42). Although Job actively exchanges speci- mens with sailors and lawyers, he does not share his knowledge  with his working-class compatriots. Rather, that knowledge be- comes a sign of his radical disconnection from the working- class community in which he is emplaced. This is not to suggest, of course, that Job is completely ret- icent and isolated from the other characters in Mary Barton.  Rather, there are two Jobs crowding the novel: one Job is a ver- bose domestic fi gure who shares personal anecdotes with his  neighbors and speaks a very strong Lancashire dialect, using  such words as “babby,” “dree,” and other terms that required  annotation.22 But the other Job—“Job, the naturalist,” as the  narrator refers to him (Mary Barton, p. 150)—is reticent, un- communicative, mysterious, and oddly incompatible with the  domestic realism into which Job’s other half so perfectly fi ts.  At the level of content, the novel would have us believe that  these are simply two parts of Job’s “implied human personality,”  to borrow Alex Woloch’s terms (The One Vs. the Many, p. 13).  Margaret’s commentary on her grandfather’s uneven behavior  would support this reading: “Look at him now! He’s gone back  to his books, and he’ll be as happy as a king, working away till  I make him go to bed. It keeps him silent, to be sure; but so  long as I see him earnest, and pleased, and eager, what does  that matter? Then, when he has his talking bouts, you can’t  think how much he has to say” (Mary Barton, p. 42). As an im- 22 See Patricia Ingham, “Dialect as ‘Realism’: Hard Times and the Industrial Novel,”  Review of English Studies, 37 (1986), 518–27. Ingham’s study of dialect in realist fi c- tion regards Job as “a consistent dialect speaker” (“Dialect as ‘Realism,’ ” p. 520). See  also Catherine Gallagher, The Industrial Reformation of English Fiction: Social Discourse and  Narrative Form, 1832–1867 (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1985). Gallagher argues  that “Domesticity dominates the narratives told by old Alice and Job Leigh [sic], nar- ratives that are moving in the matter-of-fact spareness of their language and in the  unobtrusiveness of their message: friends and family are all; duty is clear” (Industrial  Reformation, p. 79). Both of these readings emphasize what I have described as the dif- ferent aspects of Job’s implied personality.

But as Alex Woloch has ar- gued so persuasively, characters are neither real persons nor  detached signs fl oating in a narrative matrix. It is more useful,  he argues, to think of them as “character-spaces” composed of  both implied personalities and signs that function within the  narrative discourse. When viewed in this light, Job’s doubleness  becomes readable both as a distinctive personality trait and as  a sign that his character serves two different functions in the  narrative discourse of Mary Barton. As a lively domestic fi gure,  Job is meant to provide the personal background of Margaret’s  character and confer warmth and comfortable domesticity to  the novel’s otherwise harsh content. “Job, the naturalist,” how- ever, is included to parse (as much as to posit) natural history  as a solution to class-based antagonism. While the narrative suggests that Job’s asociality is partly  due to his absorption in his studies, it identifi es his familiarity  with scientifi c nomenclature as the aspect of his self-education  that alienates him from the other working-class characters in  the novel. When Mary Barton fi rst meets Job Legh, for exam- ple, she is less confounded by the sight of the “wizard” at his  work than she is by the names he uses to describe his collection  of specimens: “What things are these?” said Mary, struck with the weird- looking creatures that sprawled around the room in their  roughly-made glass cases. But she was not prepared for the technical names which Job  Legh pattered down on her ear, on which they fell like hail on  a skylight; and the strange language only bewildered her more  than ever.  (Mary Barton, p. 40) The narrator’s description of Job’s words making contact with  Mary’s ear turns on a simile that likens scientifi c names to fall- ing hailstones assaulting the inquisitive listener: words become  objects of an alien knowledge that have more power to baffl e  than instruct. As Job’s words are rhetorically transformed into  hailstones and his books into cabalism, Mary Barton invites read- C5043.indb   361 2/6/09   10:10:45 AM </page> <page sequence="17"> 362 nineteenth-century literature ers to imagine the experiences of those who would be alienated  by that “strange language”—the Latin words that barred the  uninitiated from entering the “republic of science.” 23 Recent critics have considered Linnaean Latin to have  democratized science because it was relatively easy to learn.  Amy M. King, for example, has argued that the Linnaean sys- tem was largely responsible for the widespread “popularization”  of botany. In her view, it was an “accessible,” “democratizing,”  and “streamlined” system that lent itself to widespread distribu- tion.24 King goes so far as to develop the term “botanical vernac- ular” to describe Linnaean Latin and its accompanying system  (Bloom, p. 57), but she does not account for those who insisted  that using Latin as the universal language of science largely  excluded the working classes (women, in particular) from the  provinces of natural history. Indeed, classical nomenclature  was perceived by a host of amateur naturalists to be exclusion- ary, whether it emerged from the simpler Linnaean system or  the much more challenging, au-courant natural system. Mary  Barton offers an important corrective to the idea that the Lin- naean system, or any system rooted in classical languages, had  fully democratized science. The novel fi nds in the increasingly  specialized discourses of natural history a limitation to the very  possibilities that it had originally found in the amateur natural- ist. Alongside its commitment to the notion that natural history  could provide an alternative to Chartism, therefore, Mary Bar- ton also expresses serious reservations about the diffi culties of  23 Naturalists in the period commonly invoked the phrase “republic of science”  to refer to the formal provinces of scientifi c knowledge. In her fi nal novel, Wives and  Daughters (1864–66), Gaskell returns again to the alienating and exclusionary qual- ity of classical nomenclature when Lady Agnes’s repetition of the Latin names of her  plants and fl owers fatigues Molly Gibson, eventually rendering her unconscious. Bar- bara T. Gates and Ann B. Shteir have argued that Victorian women had access to the  formal modes of scientifi c knowledge (botany, in particular). But Gaskell’s representa- tion of non-aristocratic women who are powerfully alienated by formal scientifi c dis- courses reveals the power of gender and class to determine together the boundaries of  the “republic of science.” See Barbara T. Gates, Kindred Nature: Victorian and Edwardian  Women Embrace the Living World (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1998); and Ann B.

Naturalists expressed concern over the fact that zoology  still had no rigorous system of nomenclature in the late 1830s, a  situation that, as Harriet Ritvo has argued, resulted in a chaotic  proliferation of poorly constructed names for animals.25 While  the more professionally minded naturalists moved for a wide- spread reform of zoological nomenclature, however, a com- pelling counterargument emerged among amateur naturalists  who were dissatisfi ed with the growing demand for rigorously  ordered systems of classifi cation. Many amateurs and cultural  fi gures, including John Ruskin, called for the democratization  of natural history by making English its offi cial language.26 Ed- win Lees, an important if now largely forgotten amateur who  founded the Worcestershire Natural History Society, described  his democratic vision during the inaugural speech he delivered  at the grand opening of the Society’s museum: “From the be- ginning [the Society] had never assumed an austere exclusive  appearance; they had never been limited to any grade of soci- ety. It had been . . . open to all who had talent, integrity, and a  love for the pursuit of Natural History, whatever their external  station.” 27 Lees not only insisted that natural history be open  to anyone who took an interest in it, but he also spoke out in  other venues against the exclusionary nomenclature that the  “systematists” so vigorously insisted on using.28 In a bipartite article entitled “Observations on the Pop- ularity of Natural History,” which appeared in the periodical  The Naturalist in 1838, Lees wrote: “How superfi cial . . . must  be this gold-leaf ‘popularity’ which the slightest rub effaces,  for if Natural History really were popular in the proper sense  of the term, its study would be general, and its terms ‘familiar  25 See Ritvo, The Platypus and the Mermaid, and Other Figments of the Classifying Imagi- nation (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ.

While  Lees acknowledges that scientifi c nomenclature is appropri- ate in certain cases, he criticizes the periodicals that insisted  on clothing natural history “in a latin dress” (“Observations I,”  p. 120), an obtrusive garment obscuring the “real” body of  vernacular English underneath. Using classical nomenclature,  Lees insisted, would prevent natural history from becoming  a truly popular practice: rather than becoming as “familiar as  household words,” its terms would seem like “undeciphered hi- eroglyphic” to untrained neophytes (“Observations I,” pp. 116,  122), just as they had for Mary Barton and other working-class  women in the novel. The women of Mary Barton, in fact, are shown to have the  least access to classical nomenclature, a point that the novel  emphasizes by contrasting Job Legh with Alice Wilson, the local  herbalist. On the surface, Alice’s comprehensive knowledge of  local fl ora seems to resemble Job’s botanical knowledge, which  may explain why Raymond Williams yokes the two characters  together in his discussion of Mary Barton. Williams attributes  their mutual appearance in Gaskell’s “industrial novel” to a  nostalgic longing for the natural spaces imagined to exist in an  idyllic rural past, arguing that the early chapters in which they  appear “embody the characteristic response of a generation to  the new and crushing experience of industrialism.” 30 But Alice’s  habit of making teas and humble delicacies from local plants  that she calls by English names is markedly different from Job’s  violent impaling of specimens and recitation of Latin names.  His formal (and phallic) knowledge of natural history distin- guishes him from Alice, whose knowledge is far more practical,  useful, and vernacularly oriented than his. 29 Edwin Lees, “Observations on the Popularity of Natural History I.

Margaret neither uses  technical terms nor betrays her familiarity with any classifi catory  system, even though she is the only woman in Mary Barton who  might have done so. When asked by Mary if she “kn[e]w aught”  about the things that Job studied, Margaret explains that if she  had learned anything, it was not for her own enrichment: “I  know a bit about some of the things grandfather is fond on; just  because he’s fond on ’em, I tried to learn about them” (Mary  Barton, p. 40). Though she may have picked up bits of natural  history, she has neither learned it for herself nor studied it in any  depth. Rather, she spends her spare hours on sight-destroying  millinery in order to indulge Job’s habit of “tak[ing] a day here,  and a day there, for botanising or going after insects,” and  “think[ing] little enough of four or fi ve shillings for a speci- men” (p. 48). While many working-class naturalists often sold  their specimens to earn much-needed extra money, Gaskell’s  naturalist is far more concerned with collecting than selling.  Margaret is left to worry that if she loses her sight completely  (which she ultimately does), her grandfather will no longer be  able to afford the luxuries that mean so much to him: “I’m so  loath to think he should be stinted,” she says, “of what gives him  such pleasure” (p. 48). By casting the characters of Alice Wilson  and Margaret outside the republic of science, Gaskell is able to  reframe working-class women as domestic fi gures while also al- luding to their exclusion from the formal scientifi c discourses  in which working-class men were better able to participate. The novel pursues a further critique of those formal dis- courses by introducing the character of Will Wilson, a sailor  who has returned from sea to visit his aunt Alice. Unlike other  characters in Mary Barton, Will knows enough about binomial  nomenclature to critique Job’s use of it. When Job and Will are  fi rst introduced to each other in a chapter entitled “A Travel- ler’s Tales,” Will brags to Mary, Job, Alice, and Margaret that his  friend, Jack Harris, has seen a mermaid. Job not only scoffs at  the mention of a mermaid, but also interrupts Will’s next story  about a fl ying fi sh by reciting the creature’s technical name:  “It’s the Exocetus,” Job exclaims, “one of the Malacopterygii  C5043.indb   365 2/6/09   10:10:46 AM </page> <page sequence="21"> 366 nineteenth-century literature Abdominales” (Mary Barton, p. 153). Unlike Mary Barton, Will  has heard technical names before, so when he hears Job utter  the Latin name of the fl ying fi sh, the reader “hears” it too. But  Will, still feeling the sting from Job’s refusal to believe in Jack  Harris’s mermaid, and generally unimpressed with Job’s dis- play of knowledge, meets this technical name with a rebuttal of  his own: “Ay, there you go! You’re one o’ them folks as never knows  beasts unless they’re called out o’ their names. Put ’em in Sunday  clothes, and you know ’em, but in their work-a-day English you  never know nought about ’em. I’ve met wi’ many o’ your kidney;  and if I’d ha’ known it, I’d ha’ christened poor Jack’s mermaid  wi’ some grand gibberish of a name. Mermaidicus Jack Harrisen- sis; that’s just like their new-fangled words. D’ye believe there’s  such a thing as the Mermaidicus, master?”  (p. 153) Will’s response contains different layers of critique, the fi rst  and most noticeable being his imitation of Job’s speech. His  invention of the name “Mermaidicus Jack Harrisensis” suggests  that he has heard enough Latin names to be able to formu- late the joke—he has, by his own admission, “met wi’ many  o’ [ Job’s] kidney.” When Will fl outs the conventions of no- menclature that had become the lynchpin of natural history’s  claims to scientifi c status by the mid 1840s, the novel reveals its  ambivalence about—or perhaps outright hostility to—the ne- cessity of learning Latin in order to participate in scientifi c dis- courses. Will’s remonstrance turns the exclusion of the unedu- cated around, placing the learned scientist on the outside of  language’s potential fullness, particularly when Will complains  that naturalists cannot “know beasts” unless they are “called out  o’ their names.” He understands that naturalist knowledge is  bound up with language, but he interprets this as a blindness,  a need to disengage animals from their names—that is, from  their English names. These English names are shown to be the  real ones, the ones that have to be shrouded if Latin names  are to be used, or worn as the case may be. Will’s description  of these Latin names as “Sunday clothes” resonates powerfully  with Edwin Lees’s description of technical terms as “a latin  C5043.indb   366 2/6/09   10:10:46 AM </page> <page sequence="22"> gaskell’s naturalist 367 dress.” Lees and Gaskell draw on similar assumptions about the  foreignness of binomial nomenclature, the quality that makes  them seem “new-fangled” to Will, although Linnaeus’s innova- tions would have been over a century old. The comic dispute between Job and Will makes the rigidity  of classical nomenclature seem all the more disconnected from  the more communicative forms of language that circulate in  the novel. Theirs is ultimately a dispute between the dynamic  storyteller who has experienced the sea and returned with mes- merizing tales about mermaids and fl ying fi sh and the staid  naturalist who fl attens the miraculous story into Latin words,  hailstones that fall dead on the ears of expectant listeners and  disrupt the narrative fl ow of the novel. The narrator illustrates  Job’s preference for fl at, inexpressive language, noting that he  considers writing as “little more than an auxiliary to natural his- tory; a way of ticketing specimens, not of expressing thoughts”  (Mary Barton, p. 340). Will Wilson, by contrast, luxuriates in  expressive language and takes pride in the folklore that he has  brought home from the sea. In the true spirit of the Benjamin- ian storyteller, the pleasure of his stories comes in suspending  disbelief, in experiencing community around the tale. But Job  dismisses the mermaid with a naturalist’s empirical sensibil- ity and then defl ates the story of the fl ying fi sh with the plain  assertion of its technical name. Job excises what Foucault has  described as “the whole semantic network that connected [a  living being] to the world” (Order of Things, p. 129)—the foods  it provided, the virtues it possessed, the stories and legends  people told about it, and what travelers said of it. The naturalist  is shown to pare away the stories that cluster around the fl ying  fi sh, to strip it out of its vernacular name and replace it with  words that directly correspond to its physical structure (Mala- copterygii means “soft-fi nned,” and Abdominales refers to the  location of the ventral fi ns under the animal’s abdomen). Will  neither strips living things from their linguistic contexts nor re- duces them to a single, Latinate name. By calling creatures “in  their names,” he does precisely what the naturalist cannot do:  produce an engaging narrative. Will’s storytelling harks back, I  suggest, to an older form of natural history that allows signs to  C5043.indb   367 2/6/09   10:10:46 AM </page> <page sequence="23"> 368 nineteenth-century literature exist within the broader linguistic system (and an English one  at that) that supplies their meaning and marks them as part of  a culture, rather than objects exogenous to it. Job Legh’s familiarity with the classical no- menclature endorsed by professional naturalists marks both  his extension beyond and his alienation from the working-class  community in which he is embedded. But Job’s doubleness— his extensive cosmopolitan knowledge and his working-class  identity—makes him a perfect intermediary in a novel that  must bridge the space between its working-class subjects and  its middle-class readers. It is not surprising that Gaskell draws  a direct parallel between herself and the naturalist she imag- ined. Job’s claim that he is “not given to Political Economy”  (Mary Barton, p. 384) is an almost exact transcription of the  specious declaration that Gaskell makes in her preface to the  novel: “I know nothing of Political Economy” (p. 4). And as  if to emphasize the connections between natural history and  novel writing, the narrator uses classical nomenclature when  suggestively identifying “the two great beautiful families of  Ephemeridæ and Phryganidæ . . . so much and so closely stud- ied by Manchester workmen” (p. 39). Carolyn Lesjak, who has  noted the affi nities that Gaskell posited between herself and  Job, argues that Job’s presence signals Gaskell’s discomfort with  the very narrow, taxonomic view that she employs in writing  about working-class subjects.31 Indeed, the novel mobilizes the  language of the classifying naturalist in order to tell the story  of those strangers who “elbowed [Gaskell] in the streets daily”  (Mary Barton, p. 3). In the very fi rst pages of the novel, the narrator borrows  the classifi catory discourse of natural history when describing  John Barton: “a thorough specimen of a Manchester man; born  of factory workers, and himself bred up in youth, and living  in manhood, among the mills. He was below the middle size  and slightly made; there was almost a stunted look about him”  31 See Lesjak, Working Fictions, p. 59. C5043.indb   368 2/6/09   10:10:46 AM </page> <page sequence="24"> gaskell’s naturalist 369 (Mary Barton, p. 7). By baldly cataloguing John Barton’s physi- cal attributes and referring to him as a “specimen” of the Man- chester men born of working-class operatives, the novel seems  to offer at its outset a natural history of factory life. The ster- ile presentation of his physical makeup does little to provoke  the reader’s sympathies for John Barton. The description of  Mary Barton’s mother in these fi rst pages is written in a simi- larly cold, classifi catory language: “She had . . . somewhat of  the defi ciency of sense in her countenance, which is likewise  characteristic of the rural inhabitants in comparison with the  natives of the manufacturing towns” (p. 7). The index to this  character’s limited mental capacity is written in her face, as is  “characteristic” of the “inhabitants” of such rural districts. The  narrator’s reliance on general types—the Manchester man, the  rural inhabitant—is not as surprising as the language used to  move from general types to particular individuals in the novel;  this movement depends less upon their personalities or their  inner lives than it does on their physical features.32 These early passages suggest how much novel writing and  natural history are entangled in Mary Barton and in the proto- anthropological writing that Gaskell uses in the beginning of  the novel to describe working-class subjects whose interiority  remained a mystery to her. In Disorienting Fiction James Buzard  delineates a prehistory of anthropology in the Victorian novel’s  articulation of British “autoethnography,” but he does not ac- knowledge the point that Mary Barton and many other auto- ethnographic writings make explicitly clear: that natural his- tory, and not anthropology per se, was the discourse available to  Victorian novelists who sought to write about human enclaves  unfamiliar to them.33 Yet Mary Barton’s strong resonance with  32 See Catherine Gallagher, “George Eliot: Immanent Victorian,” Representations,  no. 90 (2005), 61–74. In this essay Gallagher explains how George Eliot produced  realized, particular individuals that exemplify a general type in her novels. I argue that  Gaskell’s movement from the general type to the particular individual in Mary Barton  takes on the qualities of systematic forms of natural history. 33 See Buzard, Disorienting Fiction. James Cowles Pritchard’s Natural History of  Man (1843) is the best example of an early anthropological work that calls itself a  natural history and draws on the conventions of naturalist discourse. Moreover, J. G.  Wood’s The Illustrated Natural History (London: G. Routledge, 1853) and Philip Henry  Gosse’s The Romance of Natural History (1861) include illustrations of human beings.

What might have  appeared a senseless murder, we learn over the course of the  novel, was the result of long suffering, a poor education, and  continual miscommunication between John Barton and his  “masters.” As Mary Barton moves away from a systematic style  of natural history writing, Gaskell follows an impulse to pres- ent the conditions under which the working classes labor, an  impulse to tell the fuller history of their lives. The novel, and  particularly the John Barton narrative, suggests that under- standing the full history of a person and the conditions under  which that person acts is the only way to cultivate “sympathy for  suffering” and ease the tensions between masters and working  men (Mary Barton, p. 366).34 Gaskell’s movement away from the classifi catory approach  associated with Job Legh does not mean, however, that she dis- avowed natural history altogether. In attending to John Bar- ton’s motives and the conditions that produced them, the novel  endorses a different form of natural history writing that more  closely resembles Will Wilson’s storytelling than Job Legh’s clas- sifi catory logic. This mode of natural history, often practiced by  women naturalists during the Victorian period, required ver- nacular English and relied on narrative forms to provide the full  context of an animal’s actions and describe its habits and habi- tat.35 I quote at length from William Swainson’s well-respected  Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural History (1834), which  Wood’s book introduces a long passage on man that begins with this classifi catory dis- tinction: “There is but one genus of mankind, Homo, and but one species, Sapiens”  (Illustrated Natural History, p. 2). 34 Catherine Gallagher’s illuminating discussion of the problems surrounding cau- sality in Mary Barton (problems visible in Gaskell’s refusal to submit “to a single explan- atory mode” for John Barton’s actions) show that Gaskell could not easily settle on a  particular cause for John Barton’s actions (see Industrial Reformation, p. 65). As I argue,  natural history offered not so much a causal explanation for working-class actions as  a consideration of the conditions that lead to particular actions, as well as a mode of  writing that fully describes those conditions. 35 According to Barbara T. Gates, Victorian women participated in natural history  by becoming “educators and popularizers, carefully explaining new views of the physi- cal and natural world—translating scientifi c discourse into the vernacular” (Kindred  Nature, p. 36). Women managed to write “the story of science,” she argues, “by empha- sizing its wonders: the puzzling or seemingly indecipherable, the new, the remarkable,  C5043.indb   370 2/6/09   10:10:46 AM </page> <page sequence="26"> gaskell’s naturalist 371 supplies just this type of narrative form to exonerate one bird  from a crime that it allegedly committed: Country gentlemen complain of their fruit being devoured  by birds, and orders are given for an indiscriminate destruc- tion of birds-nests: the sparrows, more especially, are persecuted  without mercy, as being the chief aggressors; while the Robin  redbreast, conceived to be the most innocent inhabitant of the  garden, is fostered and protected. Now, a little acquaintance with  the natural history of these two birds would set their characters  in opposite lights. The sparrows, more especially in country situa- tions, very rarely frequent the garden; because, grain being their  chief food, they search for it round the farmyard, the rick, and  the stable: they resort to such situations accordingly. The Robins,  on the other hand, are the great devourers of all the small fruits:  they come from the nest just before the currants and gooseber- ries are ripe; and they immediately spread themselves over the  adjacent gardens, which they do not quit so long as there is any  thing to pillage. It may appear strange, as it certainly is, that no  writer on our native birds should have been aware of these facts;  but it is only a proof how little those persons,—who are, never- theless, interested in knowing such things,—attend to the habits  and economy of beings continually before their eyes.36 This strikingly anthropomorphic passage illustrates Swainson’s  larger point about the value of natural history: that only by un- derstanding the habits and motives of each particular bird can  naturalists ever disabuse themselves of any wrongful prejudice  that they might harbor against the innocent sparrow. As the  nomenclature debates suggest, naturalists continued to dispute  whether learning the “history” of an organic life form required  rigorous classifi cation or the narrative tactics of the storyteller.  The tension between these two forms of natural history—one  that relies on strict classifi cation, and one that relies on nar- ratives to describe habits, habitats, and behaviors—had direct  the odd or amazing story of a creature or a plant that was previously little discussed or  little known” (Kindred Nature, p. 36). 36 William Swainson, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural History, vol. 59  of Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and  Longman, [1834]), pp. 144–45.

The epigraph to chapter 5  of Mary Barton, from Ebenezer Elliott’s “The Splendid Village”  (1834), therefore invokes the two epistemological choices  open to novelists and naturalists writing about a particular ob- ject of study: “ ‘Learned he was; nor bird, nor insect fl ew, / But  he its leafy home and history knew: / Nor wild-fl ower decked  the rock, nor moss the well, / But he its name and qualities  could tell’ ” (Mary Barton, p. 38). Gaskell relied on a combination of these two epistemologi- cal approaches in her representation of the working classes,  and of John Barton in particular. On the one hand, she de- scribes the physical features of this “specimen of a Manchester  man,” and on the other hand, she illustrates the environmental  pressures that contributed to his otherwise incomprehensible  actions.37 Systematic natural history, the novel therefore sug- gests, need not be completely discarded—rather, it must be  combined with a more useful and morally productive mode of  naturalist writing in order to explain the full history of a living  thing. Through Mary Barton, then, Gaskell endorses the idea  that novelists might combine the two naturalist epistemologies  to encourage the development of cross-class sympathies. And  like the novelist herself, Gaskell’s naturalist must learn to re- confi gure his knowledge of natural history so that he may use  it to mediate between the two worlds that had become alien to  one another. This is in fact what Job Legh is shown to do in the  fi nal part of the novel. Perhaps Job’s most important role in Mary  Barton is that of translator. As we have seen, his knowledge of  37 As Catherine Gallagher notes in The Industrial Reformation of English Fiction, Gas- kell’s novel fi nally forecloses the representation of working-class suffering and political  action by turning to Mary Barton’s narrative, just as its proposed title was changed from  “John Barton” to “Mary Barton.” But this foreclosure hardly erases the tensions that  exist within John Barton’s narrative, or occlude Gaskell’s experimentation with the dif- ferent possibilities that natural history held for her project of garnering sympathy for  the working classes.

But the latter half of the novel  pushes his role as an intermediary between classes even fur- ther by emphasizing his translation of legal terms (e.g., alibi,  subpoena, and assizes) to help Mary Barton navigate the maze  of the legal system in which Jem is embroiled. Job’s knowledge  of natural history and its classifi catory systems, though never  particularly useful in its own right, becomes valuable within  the working-class community when facilitating this process of  translation. The fi nal chapters of the novel, which chronicle  Jem’s trial and his eventual marriage to Mary Barton, concern  the trial and its melodrama less than it does Mary’s urgent need  for a translation of the unfolding events. In fact, the drama of  Mary’s breakdown turns on her inability to understand what is  actually happening to Jem in the legal system. At this critical  moment in the novel, Job’s two character-functions merge in  a way that they never have before. His knowledge of Latinate  terms helps him explain the workings of the bourgeois pub- lic sphere to the working-class characters excluded from it. Job  thus travels between the two worlds he usually inhabits by trans- lating terms, securing lawyers, and explaining the confusing  minutiae of the legal system to Mary. By becoming a translator  within the Mary Barton narrative, the naturalist fi nally manages  to convert his seemingly arcane knowledge into a socially use- ful tool. Job’s most important act of translation occurs in the chap- ters intervening between the deaths of John Barton and Esther,  when Job interprets and explains Barton’s actions to Mr. Car- son, the father of the man whom Barton had murdered. Gaskell  always regretted adding these sections, as she explained in an  1848 letter to her publisher, written just after she was initially  told that she would not have to add them: “it is such a relief to  fi nd I shall not have to dilute my story so much as I feared. It  would be like adding water to an already drained tea-pot.” 38  Gaskell’s aversion to adding these intervening sections suggests  38 Elizabeth Gaskell, letter to Edward Chapman, 26 May 1848, in Further Letters of  Mrs Gaskell, ed.

In the  end, however, she had no choice but to add these passages, an  addition that imposed an unwelcome intermediary between  John Barton and Gaskell’s reading audience. Job’s most impor- tant act of translation fi nally replaces the voice of the Chartist,  reinterpreting his actions and explaining them in a way that dif- fers dramatically from John Barton’s. Job explains for the sake  of readers who were unwilling or unable to imagine themselves  in Barton’s shoes or to achieve any kind of sympathy for him.  In Job Legh, then, Gaskell balances her self-imposed obligation  to represent the suffering of the working classes faithfully with- out endorsing the anomie that John Barton and his Chartism  represent. Job serves as a critical counterpoint to the violent  Chartist, a representative of an alternative route—albeit a be- leaguered one—to the future of interclass relations. Although  he may never fully displace the specter of John Barton, as Les- jak has argued,39 the words of the naturalist ultimately supplant  the potentially demagogic voice of the Chartist in these endur- ing scenes of translation. Job Legh is the only character in Mary Barton that can  move across the very class divide on which the novel is pre- mised. For this reason, he provides the only characterological  solution to the tense social relations that the novel diagnoses  as its central problem, while also serving the narrative function  of mediating between readers of the novel and the working- class characters within it. Mary Barton therefore ends with  Job’s movement back into a state of absorption, a parallel to  the reader closing the book’s cover. In the very last lines of the  novel, Jem Wilson describes the contents of a letter that he and  Mary have received from England: “Job Legh talks of coming [to  Canada] too,—not to see you, Mary,—nor you, mother,— . . .  but to try and pick up a few specimens of Canadian insects. . . .  All the compliment is to the earwigs, you see, mother?” The  fi nal words of the novel dwell on Job’s near-sightedness and his  absorption in matters decisively non-human: “ ‘Dear Job Legh!’  said Mary, softly and seriously” (Mary Barton, p. 393). 39 See Lesjak, Working Fictions, p. 59.

The naturalist, like the novelist, is thus always imag- ined in opposition to someone else—to John Barton, Alice  Wilson, Will Wilson, Mary Barton, even to his granddaughter  Margaret—for he is of their world, but also stands outside of it.  Job Legh’s irresolvable doubleness is both necessary and trou- bling, a reminder for Gaskell that the novel had to travel the  long distance between “us” and “them.” Brandeis University abstract “Gaskell’s Naturalist” (pp. 346–375) This essay situates Elizabeth Gaskell’s industrial novel Mary Barton (1848) within early- Victorian discourses about natural history by studying the fi gure of the working-class  naturalist, Job Legh. Though often regarded as a peripheral character in critical treat- ments of the novel, Job Legh’s presence in Mary Barton suggests the possibilities and  limitations that natural history presented for writers struggling to represent the turbu- lent social and political conditions of England during the 1840s. At times, Job’s natu- ralist activities seem to offer a utopian alternative to the “dangerous” Chartist politics  practiced by other characters in the novel. At other times, however, Job’s knowledge  and use of classifi catory language alienates him from the working-class community in  which he is embedded, a community otherwise excluded from the “republic of sci- ence.” In the latter part of this essay, I argue that Gaskell, by aligning herself with the  confl icted naturalist she imagined, reveals the liminality of her own position as a nov- elist writing about working-class characters for an audience of middle-class readers.  While Gaskell shares this liminal position with her naturalist, however, she does not  share his taxonomic vision; rather, she draws on a narrative mode of natural history to  develop a sympathetic account of the working classes, a mode that attends to the hab- its, habitats, and environmental conditions that affect the behaviors and interactions  of a living thing. By situating Mary Barton within the naturalist discourses that helped  produce it, this essay illustrates the limited political value of Gaskell’s working-class  naturalist while also suggesting the deep entanglement of novels and natural histories  in Victorian Britain.
