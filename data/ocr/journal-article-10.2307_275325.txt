<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CEREMONIAL BAR AND ASSOCIATED FEA- TURES OF MAYA ORNAMENTAL ART WALTER W. TAYLOR IN 1913, Spinden published his monumental work on the artistic forms in Maya culture.1 Since that time, many of his statements have as- sumed axiomatic character in the literature and discussion of Maya ar- chaeology. However, as was to be expected, new information has tended to modify some of the generalizations put forward in 1913. In the pres- ent paper, I would like to offer evidence to support the hypothesis that certain artistic compositions, treated separately by Spinden, actually are members of a single complex, and then to review some of his generali- zations in the light of this evidence and Maya chronology.2 The complex which I propose to demonstrate consists of the Cere- monial Bar, the Bar Pendant, and the Frieze-mask.3 It is my thesis that the Bar Pendant is the conceptual equivalent of the Ceremonial Bar and, in actual practice, is substituted for the latter. Similarly, the Frieze- mask is conceptually connected with the Bar and, thus, directly or in- directly, with the Pendant. Evidently a process of substitution and con- vergence, already noted by Spinden,4 has brought about a most intricate and thorough exchange of detail, form, and function. Figs. 7 and 8 present some of the lines of typological association by which the above assertions may be evaluated. Fig. 7, A, shows the similarity in form and placement between the Ceremonial Bar and Bar Pendant. It is apparent that the trefoil (sometimes a quatrefoil) may re- place the serpent head at the end of the central panel. In fact, it seems most probable, as both Gordon and Seler5 pointed out with regard to cer- 1Spinden, 1913. 2 I wish to express my great appreciation to Dr. A. M. Tozzer, under whose inter- ested guidance this paper took its initial form. I would, also, like to offer appreciative thanks to J. E. Thompson, Clyde Kluckhohn, and W. S. Stallings, Jr. for much help and valued criticism, and to Francis Richardson and the Carnegie Institution of Washington for putting their magnificent photographic files at my disposal. 3 The Ceremonial Bar is a bar-like object, straight or curved, which is clasped to the breast of certain anthropomorphic representations in Maya art (Fig. 7: A, 1, and B, 1). The Bar Pendant is a horizontal pendant which hangs from the neck of, or appears ap- parently unsupported on the breast of, many anthropomorphic and other figures (Fig. 7: A, 4-7, and B, 5-6; Fig. 8: F, 5-6). The Frieze-mask is the large, full-face "mask" seen above the doors on certain buildings of Campeche and Yucatan (Fig. 7: C, 6-7, and D, 5; see also Seler, 1916, p. 20 ff.). 4 Spinden, 1913, pp. 46, 123 ff. 5 Gordon, 1905; Seler, 1915, pp. 44 ff. Much of the preliminary work on the present paper had been done when these references were discovered. Gordon's and Seler's ap- proaches had been from the point of design, while mine began with the similarities in us- 48</page><page sequence="2">FEATURES OF MAYA ORNAMENTAL ART tain forms, that the trefoil is merely a simplified snake's head. Fig. 7, B, gives other examples of this serpent head and trefoil equivalence. Other elements and motives common to Ceremonial Bars and Bar Pendants may be listed: (1) feathers at the ends of central panels instead of serpent heads or trefoils,6 (2) criss-cross or plaited designs in the central panels,7 (3) "serpent spots" in the central panels,8 (4) plaited design in the vertical "collar" panels,9 and (5) dots in the "collar" panels.10 Fig. 7 C, Nos. 2-5, are not "normal" Ceremonial Bars nor are they Pendants. However, if these representations were hung from the neck or clasped to the breast of a human figure, there could be no doubt as to their designation. I believe, therefore, that they are to be considered in the same light as normal Ceremonial Bars and regular Bar Pendants. The term "supported," as opposed to "enfolded," Ceremonial Bar may be coined to describe Nos. 3-5. No. 2 is not associated with a human fig- ure but is believed to represent the "concept"1' of a Ceremonial Bar. Fig. 7, C and D, show that the central panels of both Bars and Pendants may carry a face-panel. From this to the Frieze-mask with its central mask and lateral serpent heads, or their trefoil equivalents, is but a short step. The similarity of the "ear ornaments" on Frieze-masks (Fig. 7: C, 6; D, 5) to the ends of "collar" panels on certain Ceremonial Bars (Fig. 7: A, 2) shows that the elaboration of both forms runs to similar motives. The Bar Pendant seen in Fig. 8, F, No. 3, brings this form into the same grouping. Fig. 8, E and F, submit more evidence for the association of the three members of the complex: Ceremonial Bar and Bar Pendant (Fig. 8: E, 1-2, 3-5), serpent head and trefoil (Fig. 8: F, 4-6), and Bar Pend- ant and serpent (Fig. 8: F, 1-3); also, this "plaited snake" motive may be seen in the wall paintings at the site of Santa Rita.12 age and placement between the Bar and Pendant and from there led to the recognition of likeness in form and detail.

This form has been identified as a shell and is associated with, and to be consid- ered among, the various Maya water symbols.13 Since, then, Bar Pend- ants can be shells and since both shells and serpents are water symbols, a conceptual connection between a serpent and the Pendant is logically possible, not to say probable. The balancing of a shell against a segment of Pendant again suggests an equation of the two forms (Fig. 8: G, 5).14 Also, both shells and segments of Pendants are found alone and unat- tached, evidently as space fillers, on monuments at several sites.'5 Further similarities in the presentation and elaboration of Bars and Pendants are observed in the use of "bone" chains16 and in the presence of shells and "concepts" of Bars and Pendants within the feather head- dresses of figures on many monuments.17 The question arises as to how significant all these substitutions and typological similarities are. Do they have meaning for the interpretation of Maya concepts and ideas or only for the understanding of artistic elaboration? There appears to be evidence to indicate that the artistic complex holds together because of basic ideas. First, there is the unifying concept of water symbolism. The case is strengthened by the existence of two consistencies which seem to govern the presentation of Bar Pend- 13 Tozzer and Allen, 1910, pp. 296 ff; Spinden, 1913, pp. 83 ff. 14 Spinden has observed that this composition is characteristic of the "Two-headed Dragon" (Spinden, 1913, pp. 53, 66 ff). See also Maudsley (1895-1902, Vol. 4, PI. 93), who was probably the first to draw attention to this design. Seler also demonstrated this connection between the "Dragon" and the composition (Seler, 1915, pp. 89 ff). It is im- portant to note that this creature is very closely connected with water symbolism (Thompson, 1939, pp. 154 ff). 15 Palenque, Temple of the Cross, west pier of House C in the Palace; Etzna, stela 5; Copan, stela 2.

Quirjgua, stela F; this chain, terminating in two large serpent heads, is accorded the same treatment as a true Ceremonial Bar. This is seen from the hands, which are in the same posture and position they often take when enfolding a Ceremonial Bar. 17 Tikal, stela 16, lintel of Structure 10; Piedras Negras, stela 8; Palenque, House A east, Temple of the Foliated Cross, see Fig. 8: G, 1. In this panel, and also in that of the Temple of the Cross, the so-called "tree" is obviously highly anthropomorphized. It is my belief that the birds perched atop these "trees" or "crosses" substitute for the feather headdresses commonly found on human figures upon many monuments. In designing the composition, the usual headdress would not have been appropriate to, nor would it have fitted, such forms as these "crosses" or "trees". Replacement by an actual bird was not only typologically sound, due to the feathers, but also practically and esthetically expe- dient, making a reasonable composition and not a travesty. In this discussion, the bird is said to substitute for the headdress only because the latter is the more frequent form. It is highly possible that the feather headdress is the adaptation of an original concept con- cerning an actual serpent-bird. 52 [1, 1941</page><page sequence="6">FEATURES OF MAYA ORNAMENTAL ART ants and Ceremonial Bars. When the hands of the principal figure on a monument are occupied with separate objects, the Pendant substitutes for the Bar. For example at Quirigua, when the hands hold a Manikin Sceptre and a Shield, the Pendant is worn. Similar cases can be found on many monuments at many sites: Naranjo, Coba, Tikal, Yaxchilan, It- simte, Piedras Negras, La Milpa, etc. It seems that when the Maya de- signer wished to have his subject handle several articles of paraphernalia, he released the hands for this purpose by suspending the usual Bar, which thus became a pendant.'8 There are some exceptions to this prac- tice: cases in which the principal figure's hands are free and yet in which the Pendant is the form used.19 There are also cases in which one hand covers the ornament but appears to be gesturing rather than holding the object.20 The second consistency is that when a figure is of secondary impor- tance, i.e. when it is smaller than, or subservient to, a principal figure or when there is no one principal figure, the Bar Pendant is worn whether the hands are occupied or not. There appear to be fewer exceptions to this generalization. Stelae 1 and 4 at Yaxchilan are the only instances so far noticed, in which minor figures carry Ceremonial Bars. However, in the panel of full-figure glyphs on stela D at Copan, there is a small gro- tesque figure holding an atypical Bar. Also, in the wall-panel in the Tem- ple of the Sun at Palenque, one of the priests, here secondary to the cen- tral assemblage, offers a Long-nosed God21 on a supported Ceremonial Bar. For the rest, the generalization holds true with an apparently sig- nificant regularity. In regard to these two consistencies, it may be suggested that the different paraphernalia, including the Pendant instead of the Bar, char- acterize a different, possibly minor, type of priest. However reasonable this view may be (and I think it perfectly reasonable), it does not ne- gate the significance of the ubiquitous water symbolism and the typologi- cal affinities which indicate that, whatever the variations of priesthood or ornamentation, the same concept lies behind the use of both the Cere- 18 The chronological implications of this statement will be clarified below.

The Frieze-mask is part of, or at least connected with, the Quetzalcoatl facade. Further, faces that appear very similar are found as central panels on certain Bar Pendants (Fig. 7: D, 3; Quirigua, stela F; etc.). Thus, we have one more element shared by all members of the complex. It is significant that the Long-nosed God is also intimately associated with water symbolism (Thompson, 1939, p. 160). TAYLOR] 53</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY monial Bar and the Bar Pendant.22 When both typology and use can be shown to be significantly similar and when the small differences can be explained by consistent generalizations, it is permissible to believe that we are dealing with a conceptually unified complex of elements. Turning to the other member of the complex, it is significant that the Frieze-mask appears only in that area in which stelae are lacking or are of little artistic importance. In the region occupied by the so-called Old Empire, stelae, lintels, panels, etc. were the focal points of elaboration, and upon these the concept of the double-headed serpent, in its Bar and Pendant forms, was depicted. In the north, however, where architecture was the focal point, the same concept was applied in a form more suited to the size and character of the medium. This form is adumbrated in the Old Empire by the mask panels of Nakum, Tikal, Yaxchilan, and by the representations from Copan and Palenque (Fig. 7: C, 2 and 5). In these latter examples, there is no human background, no personalization, just as there is none in the Frieze-masks of Yucatan; and the resulting forms are remarkably similar. The chronological picture is presented in Chart I. Due to several fac- tors, such as illegibility of inscriptions etc., not all examples of Cere- monial Bars and Bar Pendants can be dated. However, I believe that there is enough material to give the picture validity. Details of the car- tography of Chart I are supplied at the end of this paper. The problem of the relationship between the members of the Cere- monial Bar, Bar Pendant, Frieze-mask complex is difficult to attack. It is possible that each member had a discrete origin. It is plausible that at one time there was one abstraction .of a double-headed serpent, another of a rod-like pendant, another of a shell pendant, etc. To demonstrate this original divergence and the subsequent convergence would take more and older data than are available at the present writing. However, the consistency of the chronological picture, the remarkable, orderly pro- gression of the types and sub-types in time, would seem to be a function of a sequential development on a basic theme, rather than a fortuitous amalgamation of entirely disparate concepts. True, there may have been bar-pendants before there were Ceremonial Bars or even before the ap- pearance of the double-headed serpent idea, but it is very apparent from the chronology of Chart I that, by the time the Maya began to carve Bar Pendants on their monuments, these Pendants had already been in- fluenced by the concept of a two-headed snake and had assumed the role of substitute for the Ceremonial Bar. 22 The fact that on some figures both Ceremonial Bar and Bar Pendant are present does not, in my opinion, alter the case. Reduplication is a common feature of Maya art. 54 [1, 1941</page><page sequence="8">FEATURES OF MAYA ORNAMENTAL ART Similarly, the late appearance, together with the typological affilia- tions, of the supported Bar and the Frieze-mask indicate, not their in- dependent invention at such a time, but their development from some previously existing concept, the most logical of which is the straight form of the Ceremonial Bar.23 In the light of these typological and chronological considerations, several of Spinden's generalizations on the Ceremonial Bar can be prof- itably reviewed. At one point he says that straight Ceremonial Bars (and evidently means all Bars) " . . . apparently do not occur at Pie- dras Negras and Palenque, or at any of the cities of northern Yuca- tan."24 This is correct with regard to "normal" bars, but from the illus- trations in Figs. 7 and 8, it will be seen that the complex, in the form of the Supported Bar as well as the Bar Pendant, is represented at these places. Then he says that "In its first phase the Ceremonial Bar is composed of a double-headed serpent with a flexible, drooping body.... In the second phase the central portion of the Ceremonial Bar is no longer pendant, but is transformed into a straight panel.... "25 As examples of the first phase, he mentions the Leiden Plate and certain stelae at Copan (#2, 3, 7, E, P, etc.). Chart I shows that, with the exception of the Leiden Plate, the chronologically earliest form is the straight Ceremonial Bar and not the drooping Bar as Spinden claimed.26 It also shows that the latter is found only at the site of Copan except for the two isolated ex- amples of the Leiden Plate and stela 1 at Tulum.27 Finally, Spinden says that the diagonal Bar is a decadent form.28 But he himself, in noting the diagonal Bar and early dating of stela 25 at Naranjo, gives the evidence to refute his statement.29 Stela 25 is contem- poraneous with the earliest drooping Bar at Copan. If the Leiden Plate be excluded, we find that by the date when the first drooping Bar appears at Copan, both straight and diagonal Ceremonial Bars were well known, the former being of considerable an- tiquity. It is clear, therefore, that Spinden based his generalizations for 23 Seler derived the Quetzalcoatl facade (and thus the Frieze-mask) from Mexican sources through the cult of Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent (Seler, 1916, pp. 72-73). 24 Spinden, 1913, p. 50. 25 Ibid., pp. 49-50. 26 In a later paper, Spinden (1918, p. 173) notes that "At Copan this basic change [from drooping to straight Bar] does not appear until the end of the Middle Period, but at other cities the bar form is the only one found and possibly goes back to the beginning of the Middle Period." The Middle Period is from 9.10.0.0.0. to 9.15.0.0.0. 27 There are "concepts" of drooping Ceremonial Bars on lintels 38 and 39 at Yaxchi- lan. These cannot be considered true Bars since they are neither enfolded nor supported and are grotesquely out of proportion to their accompanying human figures. 28 Spinden, 1913, p. 58. 29 Spinden, 1913, p. 178; 1918, p. 173. TAYLOR] 55</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the whole Maya area on the data from Copan and the Leiden Plate. He made these statements without explicitly stating any assumptions to explain the obvious discrepancies.30 It is necessary, therefore, to reject Spinden's results and to start afresh by re-evaluating the data and by making explicit assumptions which will reconcile all the facts with the least possible strain. According to Chart I, it is clear that the starting point of a chromo- logical and typological sequence for the Ceremonial Bar, and, really, for the whole complex, must beone of two forms, thedrooping or the straight Bar. Since Copan is the only site at which both forms are present and from which, therefore, we can obtain relative chronological data, it is best to start our analysis with that site. Four possibilities arise: 1. The sequence at Copan, i.e. drooping to straight, may be atypical of the Maya area as a whole and the real order be just the reverse. The chronological chart (Chart I) might lend credence to this interpretation if it were not for the date of the Leiden Plate (8.14.3.1.12). Since this ob- ject is so much earlier than the earliest straight Ceremonial Bar (8.19.- 0.0.0, stela 18 at Tikal), a sequence of straight to drooping seems out of the question. Checking the Copan order is impossible because, as has been said above, the drooping Bar is not found in association with other types of Bars at any other site in the Maya area.31 2. Copan may have invented the drooping Bar independently and therefore be a law unto itself with regard to its sequence. This is hardly possible in view of other cultural connections and the earlier existence of the drooping Bar on the Leiden Plate and at Tulum. 3. The third possibility would resolve the problem by making the date on the Leiden Plate non-contemporaneous and its true date very much later, within the range of Copan dates, 9.9.0.0.0 upwards for stelae with Bars. This would eliminate the need to explain the drooping Bar's very early occurrence, its subsequent long but temporary disappear- ance, and the peculiar re-focalization at Copan. But the evidence ad- vanced by the Morleys32 to substantiate the contemporaneity of the date must be accepted, not only because of the evidence itself but also be- 30 Spinden (1918, p. 166) reaffirms his belief that "Copan still remains the most de- pendable city [for the exact demonstration of the historical order of development of the Ceremonial Bar], especially as regards the Early Period." Here again the discrepancies are unaccounted for. 31 There is the possibility that a straight Ceremonial Bar, somewhat defaced and ob- scure, is depicted on Panel B in the west passage of the Temple of the Frescoes at Tulum. Since these paintings are protected from the elements by a "Toltec," i.e. late, structure (Lothrop, 1924, pp. 56 ff., 172), this would seem to make the straight Bar follow the drooping Bar of Stela 1, thus agreeing with the Copan sequence. 32 Morley, F. R. and $, G,, 1938. 56 [1, 1941</page><page sequence="10">FEATURES OF MAYA ORNAMENTAL ART cause of a lack of contrary indications other than the strange temporal isolation of this particular Ceremonial Bar.33 4. The Copan sequence may reflect the true development of the Ceremonial Bar over the area as a whole, but as a late, peripheral sur- vival of events that had already occurred in other regions before the erection of now-existing, or now-known monuments. This assumption would explain both the date on the Leiden Plate and its stylistic affilia- tions with the very early stelae at Tikal,34 making it a product of an ear- lier period when the drooping Bar was in common use and before the straight form became dominant. That Copan and Tulum should show peripheral lag is not strange in view of their geographical location and the latter's cultural position. This possibility is the only one that is con- gruent with all the data; it is the only logical possibility. Thus, while we have returned to the outline of Spinden's sequence, the time perspective has radically changed and the foundations upon which the assertions are made appear considerably more substantial. The Copan sequence is only an echo, and we cannot predict, as has been done,35 the age of a monument by the type of Ceremonial Bar it dis- plays. Both straight and drooping Bars were known throughout the tem- poral range of all known examples of the Ceremonial Bar, with the pos- sible exception that the Leiden Plate may represent a period when the straight Bar was as yet undeveloped. After this re-examination and re-orientation of the data on the Cere- monial Bar, a very tentative interpretation of the material may be per- mitted: At some time before the erection of those dated monuments which have come under our observation, from a religious concept of a double- headed serpent, a Ceremonial Bar of the drooping type arose. This prob- ably occurred in the Peten, possibly in the vicinity of Tikal. The Bar spread southward and arrived at Copan an undetermined numberof years before the erection of the first stela which bears a drooping Bar (stela 7, 9.9.0.0.0.). The Leiden Plate presents two possibilities: it may have been made in the Peten and carried to northern Honduras as a unique trade piece or as a representative of the actual southward move- ment of the Bar idea; or it may be indigenous and again indicate the minimum date by which the Bar reached the south. The former hypoth- esis seems the more likely in view of the stylistic affiliation with Tikal. During this time in the Peten, the Bar was undergoing modifications and, 33 The date of the Tulum stela is so near that of the earliest stela with a drooping Bar at Copan that, for purely chronological purposes, it cannot be considered isolated. 34 See Morley, F.

Later, by the date of 9.9.0.0.0., through further modifications, the diagonal Bar developed. At about this time, the Bar Pendant appeared, developing either from changes in the Ceremonial Bar or from a rod-like pendant subjected to influences from the double-headed serpent-Cere- monial Bar concept. It is likely that the straight Bar and Bar Pendant mbved south together, since they appear at Copan simultaneously, con- siderably after their presence is noted along the Usumacinta River. In Campeche and Yucatan, the Bar Pendant flourished and spread. In this region, the Bar-and-Pendant conceptualization was transferred to archi- tecture, the dominant form of artistic expression. With the northward 59 TAYLOR</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY shift of Maya high culture, the true Ceremonial Bar disappeared along with the esthetic supremacy of its homeland in the south. In the north, the Bar Pendant and the Frieze-mask carried on the conceptual com- plex, apparently until art and architecture died out among the Maya. CARTOGRAPHY OF CHART I The dates of the chronological chart have been derived from The Inscriptions oj Peten (Morley, 1938) with the exception of the date of stela 1 at Tulum (Thompson, Pol- lock, and Chariot, 1932, pp. 193 ff). From the former work, the sure dates, those with one query (90% probability of correctness), and those with two queries (60% probability of correctness) have been used. In the case of stela 43 at Calakmul (9.4.0.0.0.), the deci- phered date has been used but within parentheses, since Morley, on stylistic and associa- tional grounds, believes that this reading is non-contemporaneous and too early (Morley, 1933, pp. 200-201). The somewhat controversial date of stela 1 at Tulum is treated in the same manner. Arrows are used when a monument has been dated within a range of dates. SUPERSCRIPTS refer to the numbers of representations of that design at that site at that date. CEREMONIAL BARS (1) Drooping: central panel curved, "flexible." (2) Straight: central panel a "rigid," horizontal parallelogram (Fig. 7: A, 1). (3) Diagonal: central panel a "rigid" panel at an angle to the body of the bearer (Fig. 7: B, 1). (4) Supported: central panel supported from the bottom, not enfolded (Fig. 7: B, 3-5). Concept = a design which has the attributes, in whole or in part, of a Ceremonial Bar, but which is not held or treated as one. BAR PENDANTS (1) Straight: trefoil or prongs straight (Fig. 7: A, 7; B, 3 and 6). (2) Recurved: trefoil or prongs bent back upon themselves (Fig. 7: A, 4 and 6; D, 3). (3) No prongs: merely a bar (Fig. 8: E, 5). Concept = a design which has the attributes, in whole or in part, of a Bar Pendant but which is not in the proper position; or an object in the proper location but which does not have the attributes of a true Bar Pendant.
