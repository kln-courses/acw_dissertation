At the Laboratory of Anthropology we registered approximately 5,000 new sites and 2,400 new surveys in 1988. Work related to tax breaks for oil and gas producers boomed in northwest New Mexico and southern Colorado. In the La Plata Valley of northwest New Mexico the first major excavations since those of Earl Morris shed new light on non-Anasazi occupations. Some of this work was reported at the protohistoric conference in Albu- querque sponsored by the New Mexico Archaeological Council. There has also been a resurgence of interest in the northern Rio Grande and the Galisteo Basin. Major work in the metropolitan area of Phoenix con- tinues to produce new developments in Hohokam ar- chaeology. The analysis of prehistoric Hohokam canals was the topic of the first annual special topics sym- posium cosponsored by the Arizona Archaeological Council and Soil Systems Inc. The contributors dis- cussed methods and techniques of canal study, exper- imental dating techniques, sediment studies, models of canal discharge and hydraulics, engineering, and pe- riodicity of use. Using new data generated by the canal studies, participants reexamined theories about chang- ing agricultural strategies, demographics, and socio- political development. UTAH. Under the direction of James Allison, the Brigham Young University field school tested three Pueblo II Virgin Anasazi sites near St. George. Two of these sites also contained Paiute components. Research is focused on mobility strategies and the roles of hunt- ing, gathering, and horticulture in Anasazi and Paiute economies. P-III Associates (P-III), under the direction of J. Ste- phen Alexandrowicz, studied a series of historical-pe- riod sites in Summit County that dated between 1850 and 1930. The sites include homesteads, schools, saw- mills, and a Mormon ward house. John Hohmann and Karen Atwell of Louis Berger and Associates (Berger) excavated two small Archaic sites in Spanish Valley near Moab. Excavations re- vealed stratified rockshelter deposits at one site, and hearths, pit features, and lithic work areas at the sec- ond. Blood residue samples were taken from lithic tools to aid in interpreting lithic assemblages. COLORADO. Frank Eddy and Jeannette Mobley- Tanaka of the University of Colorado (UC) walked the ground to check interpretations of aerial photos of the 856</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH Piedra River near Chimney Rock. The survey and test- ing showed that the riverside sites were earlier than the mesa-top Pueblo II site. They also documented a large ceremonial pit house (Big Kiva), a stockade wall, a cobble masonry tower, and check dams. Archaeoas- tronomical observations of the natural pinnacles at Chimney Rock were conducted by McKim Malville. His computer modeling suggests that the pinnacles were used for an Anasazi observatory. Jonathon Horn of Alpine Archaeological Consult- ants (AAC) surveyed a transmission line through the San Juan Mountains south of Silverton. Three prehis- toric sites and eight historic mining sites dating from the 1880s to 1930s were recorded. Near Florence, John Hohmann, Lori Ann Frye, and Christopher Adams (Berger) recorded 11 historic in- dustrial sites representing the second oldest oil field in this country. The sites, which date between 1865 and 1930, contain a high frequency of domestic artifacts for industrial sites. NEW MEXICO. In the last few years there has been a resurgence of interest in the Galisteo Basin. Francis Smiley and George Gumerman of Southern Illinois University and John Ware (Laboratory of An- thropology, Museum of New Mexico [MNM]) began a study of San Lazaro Pueblo that included surface collecting and testing. The research focuses on early aggregation and the colonial transition. Frank Eddy and Dale Lightfoot (UC) ground checked remote-sens- ing data for the large Glaze period sites of San Lazaro, San Marcos, Pueblo Colorado, and San Cristobal. Jon- athan Haas and Winifred Creamer (School of Ameri- can Research) continued their study of the impact of European contact and the causes of depopulation and abandonment between 1540 and 1680. Testing at 13 protohistoric pueblos produced tree-ring samples from stratified middens. Barbara Staley of New Mexico State University (NMSU) analyzed the ceramics collected from these sites and suggests that concurrent, large- scale glazeware production took place at all the Galis- teo Basin sites with the possible exception of Pueblo Blanco. Additional ceramic studies by Lori Stephens Reed indicates that extensive exchange of glazeware ceramics took place within the Galisteo Basin and with other sites in the region. Paul Reed (NMSU) has ana- lyzed the spatial relations of the 70 largest Classic pe- riod (1325-1540) sites using nearest neighbor, graph theory, and rank-size analysis. His results suggest that six discrete settlement clusters existed during this pe- riod. Robert Powers and Janet Orcutt (National Park Ser- vice [NPS]) continued the sample survey of Bandelier National Monument. In 1988, 390 sites, including one communal pueblo, cavate pueblos, artifact scatters, and water-control sites, were recorded. Testing and collection oflithic scatters in the Chama Valley and Jemez Mountains indicate that the Anasazi of the northern Rio Grande also were exploiting ob- sidian resources in the higher elevations. Under the direction of John Acklen and Nicholas Trierweiler, Mariah Associates, Inc. (MAI) obtained hydration dates from 81 obsidian artifacts, 2 radiocarbon dates, and paleoenvironmental samples. Results show use of the area from 5500 B.C. to A.D. 1800. Dates from the 61 projectile points show that recycling of points was com- mon and that the commonly used projectile-point chronologies are inaccurate in this area. In Santa Fe, Cherie Scheick and Lonyta Viklund of Southwest Archaeological Consultants (SAC) excavat- ed a portion of the Agua Fria Schoolhouse site (LA 2). Revision of the site boundaries based on the excavation indicates that the site borders Pindi Pueblo (LA 1), which lies on the north side of the Santa Fe River. Ten prehistoric rooms, one or two Spanish colonial struc- tures, and two historic houses were excavated. Analysis of the stratified trash deposits suggests that the prehis- toric components date between the late 1200s and ap- proximately 1440. LA 2 appears to be contemporary with the earliest building episodes at Pindi, however it continued to be occupied after the abandonment of Pindi. In the Taos area, Southern Methodist University (SMU) continued excavations at Cantonment Burgwin under the direction of David Crass and at Pot Creek Pueblo under the direction of Patricia Crown. Tree- ring dates from Pot Creek show that the last pueblo was built and occupied between A.D. 1270 and 1320 and that the adobe rooms were used for about 20 years before they were remodeled. Timothy Seamon of the University of New Mexico, Office of Contract Ar- chaeology (UNM/OCA) investigated 11 sites on Gua- dalupe Mountain near Questa. The sites are multicom- ponent lithic concentrations derived from local basalt sources. Paleoindian through historic time periods are represented. The study focuses on assemblage variety, tool reuse, and the relation of game movements to hunting strategies. Lonyta Viklund and James Mullaney of SAC sur- veyed over 970 ha around the Jemez Mountains. The 85 recorded sites range in date from Middle Archaic through about A.D. 1750. Along the Jemez River, most of the sites are one-to-four-room pueblos that date from the Developmental through Historic periods. All of the protohistoric structures identified in the survey were found in one area above Jemez Falls. These sites are larger than the earlier sites and exhibit different masonry. Peggy Gerow and Patrick Hogan (UNM/OCA) su- pervised excavations at 12 prehistoric sites in the mid- dle Rio Puerco valley near Albuquerque. The sites in- cluded possible late Archaic/Basketmaker II structures and short-term camps and Basketmaker III and Pueblo I habitations. Data from these sites may document the local transition to a horticultural economy. UNM/OCA personnel, under the direction of Randy Harper and Joseph Winter, also excavated a Pueblo II pit house at the Taylor Ranch site in Albuquerque. This site also contains evidence of occupations in the Basketmaker II, Basketmaker III/early Pueblo I, and early Pueblo V periods. Archaeological studies in the La Plata River drainage continued this year with excavations by AAC, MAI, and the Research Section of the Laboratory of An- thropology (MNM). Together with recent surveys and excavations by the Division of Conservation Archae- ology (San Juan County Museum Association [SJCMA]), these projects represent the first major ex- 857</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY cavations in the La Plata Valley since Earl Morris ex- cavated there in the 1920s. The studies are particularly important in two respects. First, they present evidence, albeit controversial, for an early Navajo occupation (ca. A.D. 1300-1600) and second, they document both late Archaic and Basketmaker II settlements where none had been known previously. Furthermore, the presence of corn pollen in these sites suggests that they may contribute substantially to understanding the adoption of cultigens by mobile groups in the northern South- west. Continuing work begun by the Division of Con- servation Archaeology (SJCMA), Alan D. Reed and Jonathon Horn (AAC) excavated a late Archaic/Bas- ketmaker II/early Navajo site on the La Plata Mine. Kin 'Atsa (LA 49498), contained a Dinetah Navajo component that was dated with six calibrated radiocar- bon samples between A.D. 1437 and 1466. These dates are consistent with those obtained by the Division of Conservation Archaeology. The site contained remains of a hogan and external trash and activity areas. Di- netah Gray, Desert side-notched projectile points, and corn pollen were recovered. The late Archaic compo- nent consisted of three occupational episodes between 1078 and 1 B.C. Corn pollen was recovered from a possible storage structure. A habitation and a semi- subterranean sweatlodge also were excavated. The Bas- ketmaker II component also contained a habitation structure with several subfloor hearths, one of which contained a human burial. Calibrated radiocarbon samples date the site between A.D. 26 and 127. Ex- cavations at the La Plata Mine continued under the direction of Amy Earls, Gary Brown, and John Acklen (MAI). Excavations revealed two Archaic surface structures at one site, late Anasazi kilns in large slab- lined pits at another, and a hogan-like structure at an early Navajo site. South of the La Plata Mine, the Laboratory of Anthropology (MNM) continued exca- vations along the La Plata Highway. Under the super- vision of Charles Hannaford and Wolcott Toll, crews excavated three Basketmaker II pit structures and Pueblo II-III features including rooms, pit structures, cists, middens, and milling rooms. The research is di- rected toward the study of community formation, local and regional trade, the function of various features, and population structure. The excavations suggest that there was an occupational hiatus between A.D. 700 and 900. Immediately west of the La Plata Valley, Alan D. Reed and Jonathon Horn (AAC) excavated seven Pueblo II sites north of Fruitland. The excavation in- cluded one deeply buried two-room field house, hearths, and an anomalous circular, kiva-like, masonry struc- ture about 4 m in diameter. Pollen from the circular structure suggests that it served as a habitation. Cherie Scheick (SAC), in the course of preparing a National Register nomination for Aztec Ruin, has syn- thesized the growth and abandonment of Aztec and the Animas River valley and suggests that Aztec played an important part in the collapse of the Chacoan sys- tem. Recent surveys by the NPS documented a large complex of ruins around the monument. These indi- cate that Aztec Ruins consisted of more structures than Chaco Canyon. Janette Elyea and Patrick Hogan (UNM/OCA) su- pervised excavations at two mid-to-late Archaic sites near Farmington. Four shallow basin structures ar- rayed in an arc and associated deposits were excavated. The arrangement of the structures and the external features and deposits suggested that they were occupied concurrently. In other work in the Farmington area, Lawrence Vogler (Navajo Nation Archaeology De- partment [NNAD]) is directing a major compilation of surveys and excavations undertaken for the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project (NIIP) over the past 15 years. The overview will summarize theoretical and meth- odological orientations, organize all NIIP sites within one classificatory framework, summarize the environ- mental data, and interpret patterns of site variation and land use. In Chaco Canyon itself, Dabney Ford and Thomas Windes (NPS) continued the Chaco Wood Project. Hundreds of tree-ring dates have confirmed Steve Lekson's outline of the Pueblo Bonito construc- tion sequence, but a new cluster of dates from the A.D. 800s indicates earlier initial construction than that for- merly postulated at A.D. 919. In 1989 the focus will be on sampling at Pueblo del Arroyo. Randy Harper and Joseph Winter (UNM/OCA) di- rected surveys around the Casamero and Pierre's site Chacoan outliers. The 39 Casamero sites form an early to late Pueblo II Chacoan community; the 44 sites at Pierre's Site represent a late Pueblo II-early Pueblo III scion outlier community organized around three great houses and the North Road. In western New Mexico, Keith Kintigh of Arizona State University continued excavation at the Hinkson site as part of the Ojo Bonito Project. Testing revealed a great house with an interior above-ground kiva and an unroofed great kiva 34 m in diameter with a post- Chacoan date. Over 400 rooms are present in the 24 associated room blocks. Janette Elyea and Joseph Win- ter (UNM/OCA) conducted a sample survey west of Quemado. One hundred fifty-five sites representing Pa- leoindian through Euroamerican components were re- corded in about 2,025 ha. The Zuni Archaeological Program (ZAP) has continued surveys and excavations on the Zuni Reservation. Steven Hall and Patricia Ruppe recorded an eroding Archaic deposit that pro- duced a 14C date of 250 ? 70 B.C. from wood asso- ciated with corn kernels. Tom Chadderton (ZAP) tested and excavated 11 sites including two Pueblo II pit houses, a small pit with a stepped entry, and some shallow artifact scatters. Mark Sant completed exca- vations at the Pueblo III pueblo near Ramah. One pit structure and 8 pueblo rooms were uncovered beneath the paved road. Studies at Zuni, both architectural and settlement studies by T. J. Ferguson and ongoing analyses of his- torical-period activities, form important comparisons to earlier studies of the Hopi area. Barbara Holmes (ZAP) continued ethnographic studies of Zuni agri- culture. From interviews, early maps, aerial photos, and ground-level photos, she has constructed a series of maps showing the extent and location of agricultural fields through the twentieth century. David Rhode (ZAP) is developing complementary models of agri- cultural productivity for the reservation prior to this century. John Acklen and Amy Earls (MAI) and the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of 858 [Vol. 54, No. 4, 1989]</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH Arizona have also produced important information about the occupation of modem Acoma, comparable to Charles Adams's study of Walpi conducted in the late 1970s by the Museum of Northern Arizona. Tree- ring dates from seven household units that will be ren- ovated by the Department of Housing and Urban De- velopment show that first-floor rooms were built in 1647-1648 and that second-story rooms were built be- tween 1647 and 1652. Third-story roofs, subject to more weathering, were reroofed in the late 1700s, the early 1800s, the mid-1800s, and again during World War II. Analysis of Acoma glazeware rim sherds from the fill of dated rooms suggests that the dating of types of rim sherds may be faulty. Analysis of room fill in- dicates that the upper floors, used for cooking, sleeping, storage and other indoor activities, contain few arti- facts and show complex microstratigraphy that result- ed from floor maintenance. In the last century, it ap- pears that food preparation, processing, and storage largely have moved indoors. Andrew Fowler (ZAP) and Pat O'Brien (Dames and Moore [D&amp;M]) recorded 144 sites along a transmission corridor running between Quemado and Deming. The sites include small Mogollon habitations and many artifact scatters ranging from Archaic to Protohistoric in age. Simon Bruder (D&amp;M) is excavating some of these sites to study Archaic and Formative site struc- ture and settlement pattern in higher elevations. The University of New Mexico field school under the di- rection of Wirt Wills has completed two seasons of excavation at the SU site, an early pithouse settlement, and the Brown site, an early pueblo, in the Mogollon Mountains near Reserve. The research is directed to- ward understanding agricultural intensification in the highlands. Preliminary results indicate substantial ag- ricultural production in the pithouse period. Radiocar- bon dates from the SU site indicate a component dating to about 100 B.C. In southern New Mexico, Patrick Hogan and Kurt Anschuetz (UNM/OCA) and Jeanne Swarthout (Batcho and Kaufman) directed crews in a survey of approxi- mately 3,850 ha of scattered parcels in the Mesilla Valley and southern Tularosa Basin. Thirty-one of the 92 recorded sites were tested. Timothy Seamon and Joseph Winter (UNM/OCA) completed excavations at two sites in Dona Ana County. The sites were intact only where they were covered with modem dunes. The sites are composed of pits used for baking leaf succu- lents. Radiocarbon dates indicate use during the Late Archaic and early Mesilla periods. Jeanne Schutt and Richard Chapman (UNM/OCA) tested 27 sites at White Sands Missile Range. Significant differences between surface and subsurface deposits apparently resulted from microgeomorphic sorting. Vertical displacement was much more extensive than horizontal displacement of the artifacts. The assemblages date from the Middle Archaic through Late Formative (El Paso phase). The Bureau of Land Management and Eastern New Mexico University under the direction of Phillip Shel- ley began a cooperative study of three Jornada Mo- gollon sites (Lower Stanton ruin, Upper Bonito II, and Rio Bonito pithouse village. Radiocarbon dates indi- cate the presence of an undocumented pithouse oc- cupation beneath the pueblo at Lower Stanton ruin. The Research Section of the Laboratory of Anthro- pology (MNM) conducted a variety of projects around the state. Dan Wolfman tested lithic scatters, check dams, and grid gardens near Santa Fe. Dorothy Zamora excavated a seasonally occupied late Mesilla phase site in the sand dunes at Sunland Park. Regge Wiseman recorded two large Archaic sites, a ceramic-period campsite, a bedrock mortar, a large pithouse village dating to the 1200s, and five turn-of-the-century sites near Roswell. James Moore recorded 22 sites in the Dry Cimarron Valley. He and Jeff Boyer also directed excavations at four sites in the Chama Valley. In ad- dition to two prehistoric agricultural sites, they exca- vated a trash dump from a small Spanish colonial/ territorial village and an eight-room territorial house. The Research Station studied a number of historic sites throughout the state as well. Jeffrey Boyer inven- toried the Rainbow-Erler coal mines near Dulce. The mines represent the small family-run industries that were the basis of the local economy from the 1880s to the 1960s. Boyer also surveyed the Hopewell gold- mine district where mining boomed between 1880 and 1920. Daisy Levine recorded two sites of the 1900s near Yrissari. Yvonne Oakes studied an Hispanic homestead of the 1880s in the Mimbres Valley. Her research focuses on the causes of Mexican immigration to that area. ARIZONA. Judith Habitch-Mauche (SAC) ana- lyzed historical-period artifacts from NPS excavations at Hubbell Trading Post in Ganado. The artifacts rep- resent refuse from the Hubbell household and mark the social and economic differences that separated trad- ers from the local Navajo community. The analysis shows the Hubbell family's commercial ties to the east- ern and international industrial centers that dominated American markets in the railroad era. Cory Breternitz (SSI) supervised the survey of a 273- km-long corridor between Flagstaff and New Mexico, documenting 81 sites within the Little Colorado drain- age. Lithic sites were common throughout the survey area and Pueblo IV Anasazi sites generally occurred east of Winslow. The identification and study of Chacoan outlier sites outside the San Juan Basin of New Mexico continued with a joint project of the NNAD and Northern Ari- zona University (NAU). John Stein has drafted a pre- liminary map of the site of Navajo Springs, which lies about 40 km east of Holbrook. Dennis Gilpin has con- ducted an in-field ceramic analysis. Funding from NAU will permit additional systematic research at the site. NNAD also has undertaken a regional cultural his- tory of about 162,000 ha along the Rio Puerco. The study combines survey, excavation, archival research, and ethnographic interviews. The initial survey of 1,620 ha documented occupation from the Paleoindian to historic periods with the heaviest use by Anasazi groups between A.D. 900 and 1200. Mark Sant (ZAP) directed excavations at four sites in the Puerco Valley, one of which was a 17-room pueblo with 21 pit structures and more than 80 other extramural features. Ceramics sug- gest the development of a local brownware/redware tradition. At Petrified Forest National Park, Susan Wells (NPS) 859</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY completed the final season of the park boundary sur- vey. One hundred sixty-three sites were identified along the 91 -mile corridor during the four years of the survey. Occupations date between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 1400. The American Rock Art Association has photo- graphed, drawn, and mapped rock-art panels at 23 sites that date between the Basketmaker and Pueblo IV pe- riods. Jeffrey Burton (NPS) recorded 37 sites that were shown on USGS maps. He also is continuing exca- vation of the Puerco Ruin, a 76-room pueblo dating between A.D. 1100 and 1400. In 1988 the Homol'ovi Research Program under the direction of E. Charles Adams (Arizona State Museum) completed its fourth year of survey and excavation in the Middle Little Colorado region. Richard Lange di- rected the survey which has now recorded 330 sites with 400 components. Small pithouse hamlets and ag- ricultural sites have been dated both to the late Bas- ketmaker III-early Pueblo I period and to the late Pueblo II-Pueblo III period. The early Pueblo IV period is marked by the establishment of several large pueblos, a major increase in the number of sites, and an increase in the area supporting the population. Excavations at Homol'ovi III show there to be a year-round occu- pation from A.D. 1275 to 1300 and a seasonal occu- pation from A.D. 1300-1400. Calibrated radiocarbon dates and ceramic analyses support this chronological division. In addition to the plaza, a burned great kiva was excavated partially. Lisa Young excavated a pit- house village (AZ J:14:36) within Homol'ovi Ruins State Park. The site contained late Basketmaker III and Pueblo III pit structures. In the Lake Powell area, Anthony Klesert and Law- rence Vogler (NNAD) collected 11,000 lithic artifacts from nine sites at Antelope Point. The projectile points indicate use from the Early Archaic through the Pueb- loan and Shoshonean periods. The analysis is concen- trating on site function and the use of the Colorado River gravel terraces as a regional source for lithic material. In the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona, Dennis Gilpin (NNAD) has studied five sites at Salina Springs. He obtained a radiocarbon date of 860 + 80 B.C. (Beta-26334) from a hearth containing corn ker- nels and a date of 740 ? 90 B.C. (Beta-26332) from an adjacent pithouse. Ronald Maldonado and Laurie Slawson of Cultural and Environmental Systems (C&amp;ES) tested four sites near Kayenta. They included a Navajo sweatlodge, a Pueblo I-II slab-lined storage feature, and two Anasazi sherd scatters. Andrew Christenson, supported by the Southwest Parks and Monuments Association, recorded 238 sites in the main part of Tsegi Canyon that had been visited by the Rainbow Bridge-Monument Valley Expedition (1933-1938). The survey is part of a study of short-term population movement based on fine-scaled ceramic dating and comparisons among occupation sequences of several Kayenta Anasazi subregions. Donald Weaver of Pla- teau Mountain Desert Research (PMDR) recorded a series of artifact scatters including a large Archaic site near Shonto and Kayenta. The Archaic site is one of the few early open sites with intact subsurface deposits. Weaver also conducted studies in central Arizona between Flagstaff and the Verde Valley. Analysis of the elements of rock-art panels at the Turkey Tanks Petro- glyph site has expanded the repertoire of Sinagua rock- art designs. The rock art probably dates to A.D. 900 to 1300, as do surrounding habitation sites. In the Oak Creek Valley south of Sedona, archaeologists from PMDR surveyed and tested 19 sites in Red Rock State Park. The sites include possible Archaic scatters with buried deposits and masonry structures. In the Verde Valley, PMDR tested the Burgbacher site (A.D. 700- 1100) and recovered many basalt cores, choppers, hammerstones and knives. One-hand manos and plainware jars were also common. The assemblage may have been typical of sites along the Verde River prior to modern disturbance. Wild plants, especially mes- quite, are hypothesized to have been primary food re- sources. Susan Wells and Keith Anderson (NPS) surveyed Montezuma Castle National Monument in 1988. The 70 sites that were recorded included cliff dwellings, rockshelters, pueblos, one- and two-room masonry structures, roasting pits, and artifact scatters. In ad- dition to the survey, the project included a detailed, systematic rerecording of the 20 rooms of Montezuma Castle itself. The University of Arizona (UA) field school under the direction of J. Jefferson Reid completed its twenty- sixth season at Grasshopper Pueblo. Research contin- ued to focus on the rapid social and economic changes that occurred around A.D. 1300. Excavations at Cho- distaas Pueblo (A.D. 1263-1290s) provided informa- tion for Barbara Montgomery's investigation of ceram- ic change and for Nieves Zedeno's research on pottery production and distribution. Daniela Triadan exam- ined evidence for pottery production at Grasshopper Pueblo (A.D. 1300-1400) and John Welch continued his investigation of the shift from horticulture to ag- riculture. The Tonto National Forest archaeologists under the supervision of J. Scott Wood, M. A. Sullivan, and S. Germick completed 400 projects in 1988. They fin- ished an architectural/archaeological study of a turn- of-the-century cabin near Payson, excavated eroding burials at five sites, and studied the settlement pattern of the Rye Creek segment of the Tonto Basin. The latter study focused on changes in settlement and organiza- tion over a 600-year period of Hohokam and Salado occupation. In Globe Christopher Adams and John Hohmann (Berger) have begun excavation and stabi- lization of Besh-Ba-Gowah, a 200-room Salado pueb- lo. Excavations revealed a large ceremonial community room containing a sherd-lined sipapu filled with ground turquoise. David Doyel and Todd Bostwick (City of Phoenix) began documentary and field research on the Hohokam platform mound and ball court (A.D. 1000-1400) at Pueblo Grande in Phoenix. John Cable and Cory Bre- ternitz (SSI) found more than 800 prehistoric features associated with Pueblo Grande in backhoe trenches excavated along a one-mile stretch of the proposed Hohokam Expressway. The features include five com- pounds, six pithouse aggregates containing over 280 rooms, 15 inhumation and cremation cemeteries, bor- row pits, ovens, and a Casa Grande-style big house. Prehistoric and historical-period canals also were iden- 860 [Vol. 54, No. 4, 1989]</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH tified. Subsequent research will focus on site structure, identification of household units, and socioeconomic structure. Douglas Mitchell (SSI) completed excava- tion at La Lomita, a large Hohokam village occupied during the late colonial through Sedentary periods (A.D. 850-1000). A cremation cemetery, 34 pit houses, and canal segments were excavated. A Classic period (A.D. 1150-1450) inhumation cemetery and ovens were also excavated. Together with other sites excavated in the Phoenix area, La Lomita contributed to the refinement of local chronology, site structure, and community or- ganization. Ronald Maldonado and Laurie Slawson (C&amp;ES) sur- veyed a stretch of Interstate 10 outside of Tucson. Four new sites, including a 1905 Southern Pacific Railroad roundhouse, were recorded. Slawson also surveyed about 5 km2 in the Silver Bell Mountains northeast of Tucson. She recorded a Sobaipuri seasonal settlement and procurement camp, a historic mining camp, and a historic cattle station. Two grades for the narrow- gauge railroad that carried copper ore between Silver Bell and Red Rock also were noted. At Rabid Ruin, Slawson directed excavations of the Classic period vil- lage and cremation area. The excavation of a Tucson phase (A.D. 1300-1450) house revealed 80-cm-thick adobe walls. John Welch (UA) and Richard Goddard (Fenster School of Southern Arizona) directed students and vol- unteers in the excavation of a series of Hohokam roast- ing pits on the Fenster campus near Sabino Canyon ruin. The work examined the outlier's temporal and functional relation to the larger site. This program, and the extensive educational program at Crow Canyon Archaeological Research Center, are exemplary for their attempts to introduce archaeological method and the- ory to precollege students and the public. Anne Woosley and Timothy Price (Amerind Foun- dation [AF]) continued their multiyear excavation project in the Sulphur Springs Valley in southeastern Arizona. The latest phase of the project focused on fourteenth-century instability that was characterized by short-term population aggregation, followed by widespread depopulation, before A.D. 1500. The re- searchers hypothesize that the local economy collapsed when agriculturalists were unable to manage existing arable land and water resources. The Cultural Resource Management Division of the Arizona State Museum has begun publication of the results of excavation in the Avra Valley for the Tucson Aqueduct Project. The first volume describes the Fas- times site, a group of Hohokam farmsteads occupied during the Rillito phase (A.D. 700-900). Subsequent volumes will describe the Water World site (a Rillito phase ball-court village), Hawk Nest (a Snaketown- Gila Butte phase farmstead), and other small activity areas. One volume will present syntheses and inter- pretations and another will present the basic data. Bruce and Lisa Huckell directed the UA undergraduate field- methods class in excavations at the Milagro site. The site is a Late Archaic (San Pedro stage) village site in the eastern Tucson Basin. The excavated features in- cluded a shallow pithouse, six rock-filled roasting pits, and shallow hearths. The artifacts recovered included typical Late Archaic flaked and ground-stone tools, as well as a fired anthropomorphic clay figurine and two marine-shell beads. Charred maize-cob fragments also were recovered. NORTHERN MEXICO. Randall McGuire (SUNY-Binghamton) and Elisa Villapondo (Centro Regional de Noroeste (Instituto Nacional de Antro- pologia e Historia [INAH])) directed a sample survey of the Altar Valley in Sonora funded by the National Science Foundation. The survey found 98 sites ranging from San Pedro Cochise to nineteenth-century Papago. Most of the sites were Trincheras Culture pithouse villages. Anne Woosley (AF) and Bart Olinger used X-ray fluorescence analysis to establish a signature for Ramos Polychrome ceramics recovered at Casas Grandes in northern Chihuahua. The results were compared to Ramos polychrome obtained from other sites in Chi- huahua, Sonora, New Mexico, and Arizona. The anal- ysis suggests that Ramos polychrome was produced both as Casas Grande and at some other source that provided the pottery for New Mexico and Arizona. Margaret A. Powers MESOAMERICA MEXICO. During the summer of 1988 Jeffrey R. Parsons (University of Michigan [UM]), with funding from the National Geographic Society (NGS), carried out an ethnographic study of the last two traditional saltmakers in the village of Nexquipayac, on the shore of former Lake Texcoco in the eastern Valley of Mex- ico. The project was designed to document this dying craft and to explore its archaeological implications, especially in relation to the dramatic expansion of salt- making in the Lake Texcoco area in the Late Postclassic period. The study focused on procurement of raw ma- terials (salty earth from the old lake shore and recycled material from saltmaking workshops); mixing soils to produce different types of salt; leaching the soil mix- tures in conical pits, with brine collected in ceramic jars; boiling the brine to concentrate the salt; and drying, packaging, and disposal of the finished product. Susan T. Evans and AnnCorinne Freter (Pennsyl- vania State University [PSU]) report new obsidian hy- dration data for Cihuatecpan, an Aztec period village in the upper Teotihuacan Valley. Hydration rim read- ings on 97 Pachuca green blades, calibrated in terms of temperature data calculated by Chris Stevenson (Ar- chaeological and Historical Consultants, Inc.) from thermal cells buried at the site, produced dates ranging from A.D. 1221 to 1568. This suggests that the Aztec III phase may begin a century earlier than the tradi- tional date, which would allow additional time for Az- tec period population growth in the Basin of Mexico. Surface survey in northwestern Morelos by Scott O'Mack (University of Chicago) resulted in the loca- tion of Late Postclassic (Cuauhnahuac phase) settle- ments, many of which have houses, nonresidential structures, and agricultural features visible on the sur- face. These data provide a regional context for Cuexo- mate and Capilco, excavated in 1986 by Michael E. 861</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Smith (Loyola University of Chicago), who is con- tinuing the analysis of materials recovered. Additional contextual data come from the Lienzo de Tetlama, a sixteenth- or seventeenth-century native-style map of the region; many toponyms on the map still are used by elderly Nahuatl speakers. Osvaldo Sterpone (Escuela Nacional de Antropolo- gia e Historia [ENA]) continued his analysis of Cuauhnahuac phase settlement patterns in the area to the north. Here too surface visibility of features such as houses, terraces, canals, and check dams is good, and agricultural systems are a primary focus of the work. Another focus is the study of political bound- aries, which may be reflected in patterns such as a series of hilltop shrines along the ethnohistorically defined southwestern border of the Cuauhnahuac polity. Kenneth G. Hirth (University of Kentucky) has nearly completed detailed maps of settlement at Xochicalco, and continues with his analysis of the ceramics. Sylvia Garza and her colleagues at the Centro Regional de Morelos (INAH) are analyzing ceramics and obsidian from excavations of residential zones on Xochicalco's south hill. Arthur G. Miller (University of Maryland) and Fe- lipe Divalos G. (Centro Regional de Oaxaca, INAH) have completed a second season of work on the ar- chitecture, murals, and sculpture of Tomb 5 at Suchil- quitongo (Huijazoo). The investigations, funded by NGS, focus on the tomb's extensive iconography and texts and their implications for our understanding of religion and sociopolitical organization the Valley of Oaxaca. The 1988 Rio Verde Formative Project, directed by Arthur A. Joyce (Rutgers University) and Marcus C. Winter (Centro Regional de Oaxaca, INAH) focused on Late Formative sites in the lower Rio Verde valley on the coast of Oaxaca. Deep stratigraphic excavations at Rio Verde spanned the Middle Formative to Late Classic periods, when the site was the dominant re- gional center. Excavation at Cerro de la Cruz exposed a series of Late Formative residential terraces, one of which had five rooms surrounding a granite flagstone patio. The skeletal sample associated with these resi- dences-more than 100 individuals-will complement floral and faunal remains in a reconstruction of sub- sistence patterns. The project has found evidence of interaction with Monte Alban during the Late For- mative. Sedimentological analyses by Joyce and Ray- mond G. Mueller (Stockton State College) suggest that highland land-use practices during the Late Formative may have altered the geomorphology of the lower Rio Verde in a way that fostered population growth and, at least indirectly, the emergence of social complexity. In 1988, Barbara Voorhies, George H. Michaels (University of California, Santa Barbara) and Tamara Salcedo Romero (ENA) returned to Tlacuachero, a Late Archaic shell midden on the coast of Chiapas, to de- termine the nature of an occupation surface encoun- tered in Voorhies's 1973 investigations. The new ex- cavations revealed an oval building, roughly 4 x 8 m, with postmolds indicating heavy timber construction. The function of a series of small, carefully molded holes forming an incomplete circle under the ridgepole re- mains enigmatic. Radiocarbon analysis of associated material indicates a date of approximately 2500 B.C. Circular patterns of stones were found between this main structure and an adjacent hut built of saplings. Seasonality studies of excavated materials are in pro- gress. Sites located in a survey of adjacent areas along the Chiapas coast by Jack Mallory (University of Cal- ifornia, Santa Cruz) and Steve Batug (PSU) date mainly to the early and late ends of the Prehispanic sequence, as did Voorhies's earlier, more limited surveys. Voor- hies plans expanded survey work to explore Late Post- classic settlement of the coastal plain. John Clark (New World Archaeological Foundation, Brigham Young University) and Michael Blake (Uni- versity of British Columbia [UBC]) continued analysis of Early Formative materials from the Rio Coatan area focusing on the emergence of chiefdoms along the Chiapas coast. Thirty radiocarbon dates form the basis for a revised chronology of the period between 1600 and 900 B.C. Analysis ofnonceramic artifacts suggests a much greater sophistication in craft production than previously suspected. Analysis of faunal remains by Kent Flannery and Karen Mudar (UM) indicates heavy reliance on estuarine resources, especially fish. Re- mains of maize and beans date as early as the Locona phase (1350-1250 B.C.). Stable isotope analysis of skeletal remains from 30 excavated burials from the region by Brian Chisholm and Michael Hanslip (UBC) should provide a measure of the relative importance of agricultural products in the diet. Blake will continue excavation of intact Locona phase house floors at Paso de la Amada in 1990. In 1988 Ponciano Ortiz (Universidad Veracruzana), Carmen Rodriguez (Centro Regional de Veracruz, INAH), and Paul Schmidt (Universidad Nacional Au- t6noma de Mexico) began investigations at El Manati, approximately 10 km upstream from the Olmec center of San Lorenzo. Excavation in the area where local villagers found 11 Olmec-style wood carvings during construction of a fish pond produced two more wooden heads, each about 60 cm tall, along with plant mate- rials, stone celts, and a variety of artifacts. Bruce Love (University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA]) currently is completing his analysis of the Maya Paris Codex. His basic approach treats the codex as literature, with special emphasis on the ethnographic context of its use; the Postconquest books of Chilam Balam provide important comparative material. In ad- dition to divinatory passages, the Paris Codex contains a unique katun series with historical information, in- cluding the names of places and of individual rulers or priests. Dean E. Arnold (Wheaton College) returned to Ticul in 1988 to collect a large sample of sherds from modern potters' houses to complement ceramics and raw ma- terials collected there in the 1960s. Neutron activation analysis of these samples by Ronald L. Bishop (Con- servation Analytical Laboratory, Smithsonian Insti- tution), will provide the basis for an assessment of the compositional variability of pottery within a modern community. The results will be compared with data on modern Guatemalan potters that show that the chemical composition of pottery can be related to mix- tures of clay and temper from the same region, although not to single raw material sources. This work is part 862 [Vol. 54, No. 4, 1989]</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH of a long-term study of ethnoarchaeological data from Ticul documenting changes in the organization and technology of moder pottery production. Gair Tourtellot (Dumbarton Oaks) is developing a data base for the analysis of ordinary ancient Maya houses in terms of geographic, temporal, formal, con- structional, functional, status, and ethnic dimensions. The 1988 season at Sayil, directed by Tourtellot (then at University of New Mexico), focused on surface col- lection to take advantage of the shallow deposits, single period occupation, and dense surface ceramics. Kelli Carmean (University of Pittsburgh [PITT]) and Susan Wurtzburg (State University of New York-Albany [SUNY-Albany]) supervised sampling of 73 feature clusters and a transect extending from the site core to beyond the border. Ceramicists from INAH have pro- duced a type-variety and shape analysis of all surface pottery, and Wurtzburg has completed a similar anal- ysis of lithics. Excavation was directed toward veri- fying mapped feature types and obtaining associated artifacts. Clearing of the putative central market area revealed a concentration of open-fronted foundation braces that might have been stalls, though they also can be interpreted plausibly as houses. Excavation con- firmed that a unique 2- x -3-m cylindrical feature was indeed a "water tank" built (not dug) into a platform. Obsidian hydration and radiocarbon dates appear to confirm the A.D. 800-1000 placement for the Cehpech Terminal Classic horizon. On-going analyses focus on correlating artifactual data with associated architec- tural classes to investigate function, status differentia- tion, economic organization (market vs. redistribu- tion), and political organization. The detailed maps of Sayil by Tourtellot and Jeremy A. Sabloff (PITT) will appear shortly. Excavation, consolidation, and restoration contin- ued at Edzna in 1988 under the direction of Antonio Benavides C. (Centro Regional de Campeche, INAH); the work is sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Comisi6n Mexi- cana de Ayuda a Refugiados, and the workmen for the site are Guatemalan refugees. Work in the site core focused on full restoration of the 20-room Knives Plat- form and excavation of the ball-court complex, con- structed in Late Classic Puuc veneer style. One annex building in the ball-court complex reflects an Early Classic Peten architectural style, and another Early Classic building has two well-preserved red-painted stucco masks flanking the main stair. Two new stelae bring the total to 31 sculptured monuments. The ce- ramic sequence now extends through the Postclassic period. The Chichen Itza Art Research Project, directed by Merle Greene Robertson (Precolumbian Art Research Institute) and Edward B. Kurjack (Western Illinois University) continued its program of recording all ex- tant sculptural art at the center with funding from the Zemurray Foundation and the Upchurch Corporation. To date, all ball courts and associated buildings, the Castillo lintels, the Temple of the Chac Mool, the Tem- ple of the Warriors benches, the Northwest Colonnade, the Mercado, and the Building of the Wall Panels have been fully documented. Ball court sculpture suggests that the game was played differently than the version described in Conquest period documents: There is evi- dence for use of hands, feet, and bats, but not yokes, hachas, or palmas. The Great Ballcourt may have been used exclusively for ceremonies and other public oc- casions rather than for the ball game. Several examples of bound Toltec figures have been discovered, along with apparent indications of internal conflict, calling into question the traditional view of Toltec dominance. The Maya Art and Archaeology Data Base Project, aims to record maps, plans, and art from Chichen and most other Maya sites in digital form with funding from the Upchurch Corporation. David Freidel (Southern Methodist University) di- rected the second season of survey at Yaxuna in 1988. The investigations focus on the hypothesis that Yaxu- na, the western terminus of a 100 km causeway orig- inating at Coba, was on the border between Coba and nearby Chichen Itza. The two centers were engaged in a conflict whose outcome was the emergence of Chi- chen as the dominant northern lowland center. Field investigations have emphasized mapping of the area surrounding the major structures in the site core. Yax- una was originally occupied in Preclassic and Early Classic times and then reoccupied in the Terminal Classic period, when the causeway was built. Survey in smaller Terminal Classic sites within 10 km of Yax- una revealed carved stone monuments showing proces- sional and accession scenes. The project also has mapped walled enclosures in the vicinity of the historical ruin of Hacienda Cetelac. A program of test excavations to determine chronological placement of residential structures at Yaxuna and of carved monuments in sat- ellite communities will begin in 1989. Field work at Ek Balam in northeastern Yucatan in 1987, funded by NGS and directed by William Ringle (Davidson College) and George Bey (Tulane University [TU]), focused on mapping the site core and surveying outlying residential and ceremonial areas. Excavation dated the two walls encircling the site center-appar- ently not defensive features-to the Terminal Classic period. Analysis of a wooden lintel fragment produced a radiocarbon age of 1180 + 80: A.D. 770 (Teledyne 1-15102), consistent with a fragmentary long-count date falling in the ninth century. Four causeways, articu- lating with entrances in the walls at roughly cardinal points, connect the site core with outlying architectural complexes; the site covered at least 8 to 10 km2. Survey in the surrounding region focused on Chacabal and Xuyub, the latter apparently a Late Preclassic center; test pitting indicates a substantial Late Preclassic oc- cupation in the region. Tomas Gallareta (Centro Regional de Yucatan, INAH and TU), Anthony Andrews (New College, University of South Florida), Rafael Cobos (Universidad Aut6no- ma de Yucatan and TU), Peter Schmidt (Centro Re- gional de Yucatan, INAH), and James Callaghan (Uni- versidad Mayab) conducted a survey of the northern Cupul province of Yucatan in 1988 in order to expand the Atlas Arqueol6gico del Estado de Yucatan registry and to locate possible nodes between Chichen Itza and north-coast trading enclaves, particularly Isla Cerritos. Thirty-five new sites were located in the 4,000 km2 area, increasing the total reported to 75. Surface col- lections at 38 sites indicate a peak occupation in Ter- 863</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY minal Classic and Early Postclassic times, with most major sites having a substantial occupation contem- porary to that of Chichen Itza. Andrews, Gallareta, and Cobos also surveyed the coast of the Xkalak peninsula in southern Quintana Roo, collecting data on 16 sites. Surface collections reflect occupations spanning the period from the Late Preclassic to the Spanish invasion, and suggest major occupations of the region during Early and Late Classic and Late Postclassic times. Walter R. T. Witschey (TU) and Elia del Carmen Trejo A. (Centro Regional de Quintana Roo, INAH) completed a second season of research at Muyil, south of Tulum. The site is 12 km inland but has access to the sea by canal. The project goal is to explore the relations between changing settlement patterns and trade, especially involving Cobf and the spheres dom- inated by Cobf and Chichen Itza during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic periods. Results so far include discovery of a likely port area, a sacbe con- necting the site center with the water's edge, a possible palisade along the seaward edge of the site, two distinct alignment patterns for civic structures, extensive res- idential zones, and several outlying sites. Ceramics in- dicate occupation extending from the Late Preclassic period through the conquest. BELIZE. In 1988 the Colhf Project, directed by Thomas R. Hester (University of Texas at Austin) con- centrated on laboratory analysis and report prepara- tion; Volume 4 in the Colhd Papers series has just appeared. In addition, Greg Wood (University of Tex- as at San Antonio [UTSA]) resumed testing of Archaic deposits, recovering heavily patinated macroblades and several constricted unifaces. Thomas H. Guderjan (Institute of Texan Cultures, UTSA) began a program of survey and mapping in northwestern Belize with funding from the H. John Heinz III Charitable Trust. The survey zone in the Rio Bravo district includes La Milpa, Chan Chich (Kaxil Uinik), and several other centers. The Mopan-Macal project, directed by Joseph W. Ball (San Diego State University) and Jennifer T. Tas- chek (School of Architecture, University of Oregon), began its fifth season of NSF-sponsored research in the upper Belize Valley in 1989. Field strategy has em- phasized large-scale stripping of surface features- from isolated rural mounds to an urban palace-acropolis- in order to reveal early ninth-century community struc- ture in terms ofartifactually defined behavioral groups. The 1988 excavations focused on Buenavista del Cayo, apparently the primary center for the region from Late Formative through Terminal Classic times, and pro- duced extensive charred plant remains as well as bone and artifacts. Ceramics appear to represent a tradition divergent from that at Barton Ramie, only 10 km downstream. Richalene Kelsay (CALTRANS) contin- ued her study of rural homesteads and human altera- tion of their soil chemistry; soil data, along with Ball's analysis of subsurface refuse distributions has pro- duced a detailed picture of house-lot gardens, agricul- tural infields and other facets of Late Classic intraset- tlement land use. Investigations also continued at Cahal Pech, a rural hilltop palace satellite of Buenavista, in collaboration with a Trent University team headed by Jaime Aiwe. James F. Garber and David Glassman (Southwest Texas State University) continued investigations at Chac Balam on Ambergris Cay focusing on settlement, demography and maritime trade. Mapping in 1989 will complete the fieldwork phase of the project directed by Garber and Guderjan. GUATEMALA. Recent investigations at Itzfn in the Department of Pet6n directed by Kevin Johnston (Yale University) focused on mapping the monumental architecture in the site core, documenting sculpture and hieroglyphic inscriptions (including 3 new stelae and 3 new altars), and locating outlying satellite commu- nities. Salvage excavations in deposits disturbed by construction activities indicate a Late Classic peak in occupation density. Johnston also served as field director for the Petex- batun Project, directed by Arthur A. Demarest and Stephen D. Houston (Vanderbilt University [VU]), which began its five-year investigation of the physical, social, and political geography of the Dos Pilas polity in 1989 with funding from NEH, NGS, the Guggen- heim Foundation, and Alimentos Kerns, S.A. The ba- sic research strategy combines settlement-pattern stud- ies, excavation, epigraphic analysis, trace element analysis of imports, and ecological studies; the primary topical focus is the growth and fragmentation of the Dos Pilas political sphere, especially in relation to the collapse. Demarest continued his work on early complex so- cieties in the Pacific coastal region with 1987 and 1988 excavations at El Mesak funded by Wenner-Gren and Alimentos Kerns, S.A. Early Oc6s-like pottery is fol- lowed by ceramics with designs suggesting an Olmec connection. The Proyecto Kaqchikel of the Centro de Investi- gaci6nes Regionales de Mesoamerica (CIRMA), di- rected by William Swezey with Eugenia Robinson as field director, continued its survey, mapping, and sur- face collection in the central highlands with support from the Fulbright program. Most of the 150 newly recorded sites have no evidence of structures, probably because of disturbance from cultivation. The earliest ceramics reflect a sparse population in the region about 100 B.C., and domestic wares show a continuous de- velopment from that time through the Terminal Clas- sic, with no indication of significant Teotihuacan or Toltec impact. CIRMA hosted a ceramic workshop in 1988, on the model of recent workshops in Honduras, that brought together specialists working on materials from the south coast and highlands. HONDURAS. David Webster and AnnCorinne Freter (PSU) continued their NSF-funded test pitting program in the Copan Valley in 1988. More than 500 new obsidian hydration dates bring the total to more than 2,000, the large majority from excavated contexts; 199 sites, 14 percent of the total number known in the valley, now have associated obsidian hydration dates. These data confirm that the royal collapse at Copan occurred abruptly at about A.D. 800, but also suggest 864 [Vol. 54, No. 4, 1989]</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH that elite activity continued for at least another two centuries; a population using ceramics very similar to those of the Late Classic Coner phase inhabited the valley until shortly after A.D. 1200. The Copan North Group Project, funded by NGS and directed by Wendy Ashmore (Rutgers University), undertook excavations designed to test the proposition that buildings in Maya civic centers often were ar- ranged to reflect a map of the cosmos. Ritual deposits (especially tombs) and sculpture recovered in the ex- cavations are consistent with the expectation that the North Group structures should correspond symboli- cally to a location in the heavens, particularly the strong evidence that one of the building groups was an apothe- osis monument for 18 Rabbit, the thirteenth king of Copan. Patricia Urban and Edward Schortman (Kenyon College) began a program of renewed survey and ex- cavation in the Naco Valley with support from the Fulbright program, NGS, and NSF. The 1988 work brought the total of sites known in the valley and ad- jacent areas to 250; 30 have been excavated. Deep excavations at Santo Domingo, known to be a Ter- minal Preclassic center, revealed a stone-faced plat- form of the Middle Preclassic period. Excavations at La Sierra confirmed earlier indications that the site was the capital of a Late Classic polity of considerable so- ciopolitical complexity. La Sierra represents the peak of a five-tier settlement hierarchy, with a high degree of nucleation (45 percent of all Late Classic platforms in the valley are within 1 km of the center), and ap- parent elite control of craft production. Two large cir- cular platforms at Viejo Brisas del Valle, a previously unknown and exceptionally well-preserved Late Post- classic center northeast of the valley along the Rio Chamelec6n, are reminiscent of a building excavated at the conquest period center of Naco. The Proyecto Arqueol6gico Cataguana y Olomfn, directed by Rosemary A. Joyce (Harvard University), has begun an investigation of cultural variability in the Department of Yoro, part of the zone of contact be- tween mesoamerican and lower Central American cul- tures. The 1989 season emphasized field survey and mapping, directed by Russell N. Sheptak, of sites pre- viously located on air photos. More than 550 structures and 6 ball courts were identified at 15 sites, with set- tlement clustered in four major groups aligned with distinct drainages. Ceramics and ground stone in sur- face collections show similarities with the Lower Ulia Valley, the Lake Yoj6a region, and the Caj6n area; all identifiable materials date to the Late Classic period. The 1988 season of the Yarumela Archaeological Project, directed by LeRoy Joesink-Mandeville (Cali- fornia State University, Fullerton [CSUF]), focused on site planning at the Preclassic center in the Comayagua Valley. A long-term objective is to assess the center and the valley as an interface between Preclassic cul- tural spheres of mesoamerican and South American affiliation. Excavations undertaken by Boyd Dixon (University of Connecticut) suggest that all four mon- umental structures were begun in the Middle Preclassic period with clay cores capped by crude limestone plas- ter; Late Preclassic modifications added cobble facings and more plaster. David Lentz (Milsaps College) is analyzing archaeobotanical evidence for subsistence. Sylvia Meluzin (CSUF) is investigating possible ar- chaeoastronomical correlations of the configuration of the monumental structures. The Instituto Hondurefio de Antropologia e Historia hosted the third in a series of ceramic conferences in Comayagua in 1988. Participants included analysts working on materials from almost every active project in the country. EL SALVADOR. Arthur A. Demarest's (VU) ex- cavations at El Carmen in 1987 and 1988, funded by Wenner-Gren and Alimentos Kerns, S.A., extended the known distribution of Oc6s-related cultures to the southeast. The calibrated weighted average of four ra- diocarbon dates from deep levels of a large substructure is 1590 ? 150 B.C. William R. Fowler, Jr., Paul Amaroli, and Barbara Arroyo (VU) began an investigation of the Izalco region of western El Salvador. Building on Fowler's prior doc- umentary studies, the work will correlate historical and archaeological data in the region, known as the seat of an important protohistoric Pipil state and as a major cacao-producing zone. The 1988 survey collected data from 41 sites, including 28 previously unregistered. Excavations at two important Conquest period sites mentioned by Alvarado-Tacuscalco and Acate- peque-will begin in 1989. An important focus of Payson Sheets's (University of Colorado [UC], Boulder) continuing investigations of the Cer6n site, a village in central El Salvador buried by 5 m of volcanic ash from the Laguna Caldera erup- tion in A.D. 600, is methodological innovation. Fine- grained moist ash packed around organic materials- trees, bushes, corn plants, thatched roofs, wooden im- plements, human bodies-resulted in exceptional pres- ervation, in the form of casts left after decomposition. Fiber optic scopes (proctoscopes) have been used to inspect the interior detail preserved in the casts without damage to them. John S. Henderson CENTRAL AMERICA Research continued apace during 1988, despite eco- nomic problems, which restricted availability of funds for field research, and political problems, which pre- vented access to certain geographical areas. Recent conferences and publications suggest that the gathering of primary data remains an objective for many un- known areas. We still are lacking woefully in data from the two extremes of the chronological sequence, the Paleoindian period and the Ethnohistoric or Spanish Conquest period. The following reports show that we are making progress in all of these areas. In Panama, Tony Ranere (Temple University) re- ports that he and Richard Cooke (Smithsonian Trop- ical Research Institute [STRI]), Dolores Piperno (STRI), and Lynette Norr (University of Illinois) are continuing analyses on data from the Proyecto Santa Maria. He also reported the finding of the first three Paleoindian workshop sites in Panama. One, in central Panama, is 865</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY buried and stratified and only has been subjected to preliminary testing; approximately 40 bifaces were re- covered, 7 of which were fluted. The second workshop site was located at Madden Lake in central Panama; no diagnostic projectile points were found and tem- poral attribution is based on debitage analysis. The third site, at the Corona Rockshelter in central Pana- ma, also lacked diagnostic material, but two dates were obtained on strata bearing workshop debris: 10,440 + 650 years: 8490 B.C. (Beta-19105) and 7,440 + 280 years: 5490 B.C. (Beta-19411). In Costa Rica, Francisco Corrales, Olman Solis, Ifi- genia Quintanilla, Anayensy Herrera, and Luis Felipe Solis del Vecchio (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica [MNCR]) continued research on sites in the region of Orotina on the central Pacific coast, with funding from the Anastasio Alfaro Foundation of the National Mu- seum and the European Economic Community. While the majority of settlement features (stone-cobble mounds) and ceramics suggest close affiliation with the central valley, Middle Polychrome (A.D. 800-1350) ceramics from Greater Nicoya, such as Mora poly- chrome, and obsidian blade fragments indicate con- tacts with peoples farther to the north along the Pacific coast. In southern Costa Rica, Robert Drolet (MNCR) has continued the Terraba-Coto Brus Project, focusing on large, protohistoric and historic contact sites. He also has reported additional finds of jade/greenstone arti- facts that appear to be similar to those found in Guana- caste. Ellen Hardy (UCLA) has been conducting disserta- tion research at the site of Nacascolo on the Bay of Culebra on the Pacific coast. She has continued work at an extensive Early Polychrome cemetery (A.D. 500- 800) on the beach that was first tested by UCLA in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bay of Culebra Tourist Project has once again shown signs of life, and it con- tinues to be unclear how, or if, archaeological and nat- ural resources will be protected. Juan Vicente Guerrero and Maritza Gutierrez (MNCR) has presented a testing and salvage proposal, but it has not yet been acted on. Payson Sheets (UC, Boulder) reports that under the continuing cooperative agreement with NASA (Stennis Space Center), a 1988 aircraft overflight provided abundant imagery of the Arenal Project area in the central cordillera (Guanacaste, northern Costa Rica) to assist the project funded by NSF. Digital data were gathered during four overflights by the Thermal In- frared Multispectral Scanner, detecting already con- firmed footpaths and numerous other linear anomalies that also may prove to be footpaths. Abundant analog data were gathered, principally in the form of infrared, large format, positive transparencies. A large number of possible footpaths have been found in the transpar- encies, radiating to the east, west, and north from the Silencio phase (A.D. 600-1000) cemetery on the Con- tinental Divide. Confirmation of these possible paths should link the cemetery securely and directly with its source of building stone and its source(s) of bodies, i.e., the villages on the south side of Lake Arenal. John Lawrence (University of Pennsylvania) is con- ducting excavations in the town of Nicoya in the south- ern part of the Nicoya peninsula. This area was one of the first to be visited by the Spanish in the early six- teenth century, and Lawrence is looking for early his- toric remains. Guerrero and Federico Solano (MNCR) conducted work on Isla Venado in the Gulf of Nicoya, where they recovered a number of human burials heavily ce- mented by calcium carbonates, with vegetal fiber wrap- pings still intact. Like Nacascolo, this appears to have been a beach cemetery, though somewhat later in time (A.D. 800-1520). Guerrero reported the presence of Chapparon-like ceramics in surface materials at the site of Pachote, near Canas (Guanacaste). This is the first report of these early (1000-300 B.C.) Atlantic coastal ceramics near the Pacific coast. The site was damaged heavily by borrowing for fill for a bridge, but it is hoped that some salvage work will be successful. He also described the extensive presence, based on nonsystematic prelimi- nary surveys, of late Zoned Bichrome (A.D. 300-500) and Early Polychrome (A.D. 500-800) sites in the area between Canas and Liberia where a major irrigation project with extensive trenching is beginning. Approx- imately $50,000 has been made available for testing and salvage in the project area. Marilynn Mueller (UC, Boulder) has returned to the Arenal area of the central Cordillera of Guanacaste to pursue remote-sensing-assisted settlement-pattern sur- veys in valleys immediately adjacent to the central Arenal Valley. Among other objectives, she is hoping to test existing assumptions about dispersal of cordil- leran populations to the Tempisque Valley and Pacific coast during Early Polychrome times. In Nicaragua, research continues despite the diffi- culties and limitations imposed by war and stringent economic conditions. The National Museum, under the direction of Leonor de Rocha, employs four young archaeologists and has a three-person education/out- reach staff. The office of patrimony (now directed by Samuel Baretto, an architect) has recently been reor- ganized into a cultural institute that reports directly to the vice president and president of the republic. Because of limited transportation possibilities, sur- vey activities were curtailed during the past year. In February, a survey was done in the Department of Jinotega in conjunction with the Instituto Nicaragueiio de Energia (INE) in an area where a hydroelectric dam is being planned. A report was prepared by Rigoberto Navarro in April, and in July a proposal for research in the area was presented; no details on time periods, ceramics, or other artifacts were available. At this time, no response has been received from the INE. Japanese archaeologist Kanuo Okamura carried out survey (12 sites found) in the Department of Somoto and classification of archaeological materials (ceramics and lithics) in the Casa de Cultura in Somoto. Two major projects were carried out during 1988- one at Montelimar on the Pacific coast as part of a tourist project and another at the early historic town of Le6n Viejo in northern Pacific Nicaragua. The re- sults of the Montelimar research are unavailable at present. Excavations at Le6n Viejo revealed 85 percent indigenous ceramics and a variety of other materials including porcelain, Spanish roof tiles, and majolica.

The new Center for Central American Art and Archaeology at the University of Colorado (supported by the Jan and Frederick Mayer Foundation of Denver), of which I will be the director, provides a new focus for regional studies. The Uni- versity of Colorado Museum is developing a two-di- mensional traveling exhibit on Central American pre- history under the NEH Columbian Quincentenary program. Hopefully, politics and economics will im- prove in the region, and future reports will see a growth in research. Frederick W. Lange 867</page></plain_text>
