<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO PROBLEMS IN MELITO'S HOMILY ON THE PASSION CAMPBELL BONNER UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN EVEN at the cost of a slight delay to the publication of the Homily on the Passion, it has seemed prudent to submit to the readers of this Review two problems arising out of Melito's language, which are not without their difficulties. If the view here taken about the first of these is open to other objections than those which the writer has anticipated, he will be grateful to any reader who will call them to his attention. As to the second, it is likely that Hebrew and patristic scholars may be able to add further illustrations. Such contributions will be most welcome.' READING, EXPLANATION, AND SERMON The opening sentence of Melito's Homily on the Passion reads as follows: 7ipi ypao' 7r~s 'EppaiKi'js 5680v Vay,W7aL KRal 7- apnliara 70o rujivo7rlptpov btLaoEod4lratL, 7r&amp;s 7i rpbparov Oberata Kal iirs 6 Xas aUwerat. The meaning of the second clause, ra pjlara 70toi ,vrrlp'tipov 8LacaEra?ATvaL, has been understood in two different ways by different scholars who have seen the text. The reasons for the difference of opinion are to be found partly in the range of meanings which the verb taa4a4gw may have, partly in the vagueness of our information about the exact pro- cedure that the early church followed in the matter of scrip- ture reading and sermon. The early date of Melito's homily (not later than 190) makes it particularly desirable that the implications of the passage should be cleared up and its liturgi- cal significance understood. The first and, as it seems to me, the more natural of the two 1 Mr. A. D. Nock has already earned my thanks by bringing to my notice some out of the way material. - The edition of the Homily will appear in Studies and Docu- ments. A preliminary article was published in M61anges Cumont 107-119 (Annuaire de l'institut de philologie et d'histoire orientales et slaves, IV, 1936), and a summary of further studies of the homily is to be printed in the forthcoming Proceedings of the Congress of Papyrology held at Oxford, 1937.</page><page sequence="2">176 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW interpretations is "The words of the mystery have been ex- plained;" the two ?rcs clauses that follow mention the subjects comprised in the reading that have received particular treat- ment in the explanation. If this interpretation of Melito's words is right, they imply that an "explanation" might exist in the liturgy as a thing separate both from the reading and the homily proper.2 It is probable that a doubt whether such a liturgical arrange- ment can be accepted has led to the other view of Melito's words. According to it, we should translate "The words of the mystery have been set forth plainly," understanding that the reading of the scriptural passage has itself brought the words describing the Passover rite clearly to the ears and minds of the congregation. If we view the passage thus, no exegesis apart from the sermon itself need be considered. Now it is true that 3tauaa4EY can mean set forth plainly, declare (Plato, Laws 916e; LXX Deut. 1, 5) as well as explain, interpret (Matt. 13, 36); 3 but with anything meaning problem, parable, statement, or, as in Melito, words, the latter translation seems to be more suitable.4 If rd 'nap'ara . .. . ta~aE6r47"at means that an explanation of the text has preceded Melito's discourse, how does such a pro- cedure agree with what is known of the practice of the church? It is not necessary to quote at length the well-known passages 2 wUTr pLOo is probably used here not merely because the Passover rite was a cult act belonging to a limited group, but also because the language that describes its in- stitution bore an inner meaning with reference to the sacrifice of Christ. 1 I have found the following instances of tacaat4Eev governing objects meaning a saying or the Law or the Scriptures, with the aid of Thackeray-Marcus, Lexicon to Josephus, and Stiihlin's Index to Clement of Alexandria: Jos. Ant. 5, 293; 12, 38 and 108; Clem. Paed. Vol. I, p. 97, 5 Stihlin; 178, 18; Strom. Vol. II, p. 490, 10-11; 494, 29; 496, 22-23; 466, 2-3. 4 Two other views of this passage which might conceivably occur to a reader may be mentioned, but only to remove them from further consideration. (1) If we had in the text of Melito rd jT6"a T70 UvaU7rpLov, we might suppose that the phrase was equiva- lent to "the matter of the mystery," by a Hebraism which occurs both in the Old and in the New Testament; but in this locution, as far as I have observed, the singular 77^a is always used, the plural never. (2) aaaoEa'drTa.L cannot be treated as middle, with 'iAaTa as subject and the 7rw&lt;s clauses as dependent questions. L. and S. cite as a dubious use of the middle a Paris papyrus fragment (it is really no. 1564 B, Notices et Extraits 18, 2, p. 413), but the context is uncertain, owing to mutilation, and it should not be used as evidence.</page><page sequence="3">TWO PROBLEMS IN MELITO'S HOMILY 177 that tell us the little that is recorded. Justin says that after the reader has finished, the presiding officer or leader of the congregation (b 7rpoEOrTs) admonishes the flock and exhorts them to follow the good examples of the Scripture.5 Origen's words Kal 6C' avayvwyarLa1OV Kat 8L&amp; t'a ELS aw av 8Lf'l7EWV t'poTpt- rovr-s indicate a blending of explanation and exhortation.6 A sentence in Const. Apost. (2, 54) mentions the baaUKaXLia that follows the reading. Evidently that which was said after the reading might include explanation, admonition, or exhorta- tion. But thus far there is no indication of a methodical divi- sion of the proceedings into reading, explanation, and homily in a broader sense. The practice of the synagogues, from which the custom of the early church derives, scarcely helps to explain our problem. The discourse that followed the reading of the Law might be ex- pository or edifying; 7 but there is no indication that those two elements of it were separated in such a way as to set up a three- fold division of the procedure into reading, explanation, and sermon. Nor does it appear that any light is to be gained from the Jewish distinction between halacha, precise formulation of the traditional law, and haggada, interesting or edifying dis- course based upon the reading, because the former of these constituent parts was not continued when the Law was no longer the guide of life. It is known that after Hebrew ceased to be the language of daily life, the reading of the Law was followed by a free trans- lation or paraphrase in Aramaic; but in the Hellenistic syna- gogues, where the Scriptures were read in a Greek version, there was no need of a translation. It is remotely possible that the habit of listening to a translation or paraphrase prepared the way for some explanation of obscure expressions, historical events, customs and institutions, even after the need for a translation had passed. In seeking Melito's exact meaning, we shall probably do best to examine what is known of the function of the reader in the 5 1 Apol. 67. 6 Contra Cels. 3, 50. 7 For the present purpose it suffices to refer to the treatment of synagogue practice in G. F. Moore's Judaism, I, 286-305.</page><page sequence="4">178 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW early church, a subject which has been illuminated by the re- searches of Harnack.8 He shows by the evidence of the prayer at the consecration of the reader (Apost. Const. 8, ~2), 0bs ai'nbr- 7rvJe-va WyLOY, rJcE-va 2rpo0q'rLKbY, that his function cannot have been merely the mechanical one of reading the Scriptures, and that the quality of 6LVr7Y7TLK6S, which was expected of him (Apost. Church Order 19), implied ability to expound what he had read.' Further, he was sometimes regarded as performing the function and receiving the honor due to a prophet or an evangelist. Harnack also argues that the so-called second let- ter of Clement is a homily actually delivered by a reader (ch. 19, 1). Harnack's study of the subject makes it clear that, at least in some early Christian communities, the reader's position was highly regarded, and that some duties that later belonged to the bishop were assigned to or at least shared with the reader; further, that ability to explain the Scriptures was one of his essential qualifications. But thus far one could only say that the boundary between the functions of the reader and those of the other clergy was not strictly drawn in the early period, that the reader sometimes explained as well as read the Scriptures, and that his explanation might develop into a hortatory dis- course. The threefold pattern of reading, explanation, and sermon is still not clearly made out. Nevertheless, definite evidence for it is to be found in a passage which seems to have escaped Harnack's attention.10 The opening sentence of Ori- gen's Homily XV on Numbers reads as follows:n Licet nos ordo lectionum, quae recitantur, de illis dicere magis exigat, quae lector explicuit, tamen quoniam nonnulli fratrum deposcunt ea potius, 8 A.

Wieland's work in R1imische Quartalschrift, Suppl. 7, 1892, is unfortunately not accessible to me. 9 For this use of 3L-y7~'aaoOaL cf. Origen, Hom.

The reader had read a considerable pericope and had ex- plained some part of it, but not the part which Origen had been asked to discuss; hence the apology. If such a procedure was still followed, even if only occasionally, in Origen's time, there seems to be no objection to the assumption that Melito's reader, after going through the proper selection from Exodus 19, followed his reading with some sentences of explanation before Melito ascended the pulpit and began his homily. Two other possibilities, which seem to me much less likely, are (1) that Melito himself gave the explanation, but did not commit it to writing and make it a part of his homily; or (2) that Melito incorporated it into his sermon, and a later editor omitted it as of less interest than the sermon itself. In the latter case the editor must have recast the opening sentence (which, however, shows no sign of re-handling). The excision of the explanatory sentences or paragraphs might have com- mended itself to an editor who was planning a book of selec- tions, such as our manuscript appears to have been. Even when the homilist himself took over the explanatory comment upon the Scripture lection, it occasionally occupies a place of its own, so clearly marked as to remind one forcibly that it was sometimes independent of the structure of the homily. As might be expected, there are examples of this in Origen, whose predilection for allegorical interpretation in- clined him to confine comment upon the letter of the reading within definite and rather narrow limits. It would probably not be hard to add other examples to the three which follow. Hom. XIV in Levit., ad init. (Berlin ed. Vol. VI, p. 478) Historia nobis recitata est, cuius quamvis videatur aperta narratio, tamen nisi diligentius continentiam eius quae est secundum literam consequamur, interior nobis sensus haud facile patebit. (This is the prelude to a paragraph in which the homilist treats the text according to its natural meaning before offering an allegorical interpretation.) not simply "has made known," "has brought before you," is shown by Hornm.

The speaker goes on to say that the division between Israel and Judah was per- manent. Because of the sins of Israel, its tribes were taken into captivity and so remain "to this day." Judah also sinned, and was punished by a captivity of seventy years. The sin of Judah was really the greater, because its people had not profited by the example of the punishment of Israel; but Jeremiah is commanded to prophesy and foretell the eventual reunion of Israel and Judah. Origen then says, ' bi) IXET r&amp;v avPaTwya4VW trwv, XaPf3'dro ra~7IaTa rT7s 6X7 s ?ulLEpov va'yv)caEsWf WKal ToTe 6cratT r vo-iyacra e?7rlXW^Oat. Here the preacher himself has given the taau'h067s of the reading, which, as we have reason to believe, the reader gave before Melito's sermon.'2 It might have been expected that Origen would turn to the allegorical interpretation or moral application of the reading immediately after the last words quoted above. But instead of doing so, he gives up the greater part of a page to a repetition of his text (Jerem. 3, 3-11) with some sentences of paraphrase, slightly fuller here than in the opening paragraph. The purpose must have been to impress 12 It is a reasonable conjecture, though incapable of proof, that an explanation of the lection by the reader preceded some of the homilies in which Origen enters directly upon his "deeper" interpretation with no allusion, or only a brief one, to the overt meaning of the text.</page><page sequence="7">TWO PROBLEMS IN MELITO'S HOMILY 181 the text upon the hearers.

Thence he proceeds to discuss the rejection and desolation of Israel, to point to an analogy between Judah and Christianity, and to warn the Church against such sins as had brought upon Judah the condemnation of God. It is a curious fact, perhaps significant for the history of homiletic method, that something like the arrangement noted under the last example (Origen, Hom. IV in Jerem.) was adopted by John Chrysostom for almost all of his homilies on the Acts of the Apostles. This peculiarity of Chrysostom's method was brought to my attention by an obiter dictum in the study of the text of these homilies recently published by Dr. E. R. Smothers, S.J.'3 Unlike Origen, Chrysostom does not employ allegorical in- terpretation except in so far as he recognizes certain Old Testa- ment types which have their fulfilment in the New Testament. The greater part of each one of the sermons on Acts is taken up with exegetical matter, which consists of literal explanations of the text interspersed with brief moral applications of it to the conduct of the Christian life. But this exegesis, in all but a few of the homilies, falls into two parts which differ only slightly from one another in their plan and contents. The second part, which, in fact, may be called a second exegesis, is usually introduced by a phrase which recurs with very slight variations in homily after homily: aXX' 18wE-v (or o8wtY lev ro'vvv, KTrX.) avo wv o ra elprn&amp;a. The difference between the parts con- sists principally in the circumstance that in the first exegesis the Scripture text is regularly repeated with its sentences in the proper sequence, even though separated by the comment; 1i "Le Texte des hom6lies de Saint Jean Chrysostome sur les Actes des Ap6tres" (Recherches de Science Religieuse, XXVII [1937], 513-548, esp. p. 514); summary of a thesis presented for the doctorate at the University of Michigan. - Father Smothers has generously placed at my service a pr6cis of the organization of all of Chrysostom's homilies on the Acts, accompanied by some valuable comments, upon which the re- marks above are based. The "second exegesis" does not occur in Nos. 1, 2, 47 and (at least not in typical form) 44; and it is very short in No. 8. It occurs occasionally in other homilies than those based upon Acts.</page><page sequence="8">182 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW while in the second, the repetition is usually not complete, the order of the matter is not scrupulously observed, and other texts may be brought in and discussed briefly to illustrate the main theme. The purpose of this second exegesis seems to have been merely to impress the text upon the minds of the hearers; an object which was particularly desirable for a work less familiar to them than the Gospels.14 After the exegesis is completed, Chrysostom passes on to the IjeLKbV, which, in the Homilies on Acts, is clearly differentiated from the foregoing matter, and is often marked in the manu- scripts as a separate division of the sermon, the word 'OLKbV being written in the margin opposite its beginning. Though the connection between it and the text is usually perceptible, the homilist rarely emphasizes it (as in Homily 41) by repeat- ing any part of the text or exegesis within the limits of the ethikon. Father Smothers remarks,'5 "The ethikon is a religious and moral exhortation, much less frequently a dogmatic or po- lemical discussion. It has a unity and amplitude of develop- ment that set it quite apart rhetorically from the exegesis." Thus it appears that the arrangement of these homilies of Chrysostom bears a certain resemblance to Origen's fourth homily on Jeremiah, but that there is a wide difference in the extent of the parts and in the character of the division following the double exegesis. Origen's inner or allegorical interpretation of his theme occupies by far the greater part of his sermon, while Chrysostom's ethikon is more limited in compass and more strictly confined to the moral lesson suggested by the text. THE ANGEL AND THE RENDING OF THE TEMPLE VEIL Towards the end of his homily (p. 16, 26-32), in the course of a bitter denunciation of the Jews as the slayers of the Christ, Melito mentions the portents that attended the crucifixion, beginning with the unnatural darkness; then he continues: KaL ydap 7TO Xaov p? 7TpinOVTOrs, rPbTp.taCLrE 7?1 'Y, Trot XcaoV /4( OPlEJI4otr S, eko3Orloavr o p oovpaLoil, T70 Xaov iA) 7reptoLETXL(o)YIEovo, 7rEptLoXiLaTro 6 o yYeXos, 14 Cf.

The words reptLEuXtraro 6 bcyyEXos are of special interest. They are not merely a pathetic commonplace, like our saying, "angels weep."

In the literature of the church there are several passages, not all of which have been previously noticed, that connect an angel with the rending of the veil. Some of these occur in authors who have probably or certainly imitated Melito; these should be examined first. Alexander of Alexandria, Sermo de anima et corpore deque passione Domini, 6: Caeli luminaria expaverunt, sol fugit, luna disparuit, sidera lumen suum subtraxerunt, dies cessavit; templo excessit attonitus post velum dis- cissum angelus, tenebrae tellurem obruerunt in qua Dominus eius oculos clauserat.16 Kruiger has showed that Alexander's sermon is dependent for some of its ideas and also in some details of its language upon Melito.17 The soundness of his conclusion, which was of course based upon an examination of the Syriac fragments (especially 16 Mai, Nova Patrum Bibliotheca, II, 537; Migne, P. G. 18, 599 C. 17 Zeitschrift fUr wiss. Theologie, XXXI (1888), 434-448.</page><page sequence="10">184 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW No. 16 Otto) is now placed beyond doubt by the discovery that fr. 16 is merely a series of excerpts from our homily.'8 But Alexander treats Melito's words freely, and the language that he uses about the angel and the veil differs from that of Melito so widely as to suggest that for this detail, at least, he needed no literary precedent, but merely echoed a popular Christian tradition. Alexander's angel, in alarm at the catastrophe, rends the veil and departs from the temple. Melito implies that the rending of the veil by the angel is a gesture of mourn- ing; but says nothing of the angel's forsaking the temple. Pseudo-Cyprianus, Adversus Iudaeos, 4 (Hartel, p. 136): Commota est omnis nativitas in Domini passione, populus mansit immobilis sine trepida- tione; angelus in paenitentiam conscisso velamine refugit, plebs sine pavore integra veste permansit; conversa sunt elementa et confusa, Israel securus duravit. The author's dependence upon Melito, closer elsewhere than in this passage, has been proved by H. Jordan, who believed that the actual writer of the treatise was Novatian.'9 The angel's gesture is an act of penitence and contrition, emotions closely akin to that implied by Melito's rrEptEaxaaro; but, here differing from Melito and agreeing with Alexander, the author mentions the flight of the angel expressly. The evidence that Proclus of Constantinople (fifth century) made use of Melito's homily cannot be presented in full at this time; it will be treated in the edition of the homily which is now in preparation. The following passages are to be consid- ered in connection with the topic before us. Oration 11 (a discourse on the Passion delivered on Good Friday) 3 (P.

But there is one important difference; the angel is not mentioned, and the rending of the veil is an act of anguish and consternation attributed to the temple itself, which, like the earth and the sun, is represented as sentient, and responsive to the tragedy of the Cross. The reason for the change is, probably, that Proclus, finding no warrant in canoni- cal Scripture for the mention of the angel, chose to adhere more closely to the narrative of the Gospel. Since even Alexander and Pseudo-Cyprian, who undoubtedly borrowed from Melito here and there, added to his words the idea that the angel departed from the temple, it is reasonable to suppose that they drew from an additional source, which must have been an early and popular traditional interpretation of the portent of the rent veil. That this notion was widely held is shown by some of the following passages, none of which, as far as we know, owes anything to Melito's sermon. Tertullian, adv. Marcionem IV, 49 (ed. Kroymann, p. 564): Scissum est et templi velum, angeli eruptione derelinquentis filiam Sionis tamquam in vinea speculam et in cucumerario casulam. Clem. Recogn. 1, 41 (P. G. 1, 1231 B): Denique cum pateretur, omnis ei compassus est mundus; nam et sol obscuratus est, montesque disrupti, et sepulcra patefacta sunt, velum templi scissum est, velut lamentans excidium loco imminens.

In his note on the passage Charles remarks that 'v~yva is not used as a translation for the Hebrew words for veil, curtain (parocheth, masaq); I would therefore suggest that the branches of the text which use 'vu-ta were influenced by the notion that the veil was the "gar- ment" of the temple or its indwelling angel.</page><page sequence="12">186 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Test.

In his letter to Hedybia [ep. 120], 8, Jerome again says that it recorded the break- ing and fall of the great lintel, and adds that it did not tell of the rending of the temple veil.) The next passage, which requires special consideration be- cause of a textual problem, is not concerned with the crucifixion, yet is not entirely irrelevant. It is from the Protevangelium Jacobi. In chapter 23 Zacharias, the father of John the Bap- tist is slain by emissaries of Herod in the forecourt of the tem- ple. The other priests are alarmed when he does not come out, and when one of them goes in to see what has happened, he finds a pool of blood on the floor beside the altar, and hears a voice declaring that Zacharias has been murdered and that his blood shall not be wiped away until his avenger shall come. The priest reports what he has seen to his fellows, and then (24, 3) these words follow: Kal roX/E~lavres E LC77X0o Kal elbov 7 yeyov'o, Kal rdA 4arTwz'tara Tro X vaov WXOX ava, Kal abrol repte.X..aTo aro avwGE' EWS KaTw.

Looking back over these passages, we find that they fall into three groups: 1. Those that represent the rending of the veil as an act of the temple itself, personified and protesting against the crime of the crucifixion. Here we have the passages from Proclus and that from the Clementine Recognitions. In the passage from the Testament of Levi the personification is not clear, and can be inferred only from the purpose implied in the &amp;rmE clause. In the Protevangelium the personification of the tem- ple structure is clear, but the veil is not in question and the time is not that of the crucifixion; however, there is little doubt that the passage has been influenced by Matt. 27, 51. 2. Those that represent the angel as tearing the veil in alarm or grief, or as a token that the place is no longer holy, and departing from the temple. Here we have Tertullian, Alexander, Pseudo-Cyprian, Hilary, and the Testament of Benjamin, except that the last names the Spirit of God, rather than the angel, as departing and going over to the Gentiles. Jerome simply takes the rending of the veil, which he does not ascribe to the angel, as a token that the holy things of the sanctuary now belong to the Gentiles. 3. Melito stands alone in that he implies that the veil was rent by the grief-stricken angel, yet does not mention the angel's flight from the temple. It is likely that he knew of it, but omitted express mention of it for reasons of rhetorical economy. 21 See Amann's note in his edition of the Protevangelium.</page><page sequence="14">188 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW In our passage he is concerned only with the contrast between the sympathy of nature and of supramundane beings on the one side, and the apathy of the Chosen People on the other; the desertion of the sanctuary is another theme, which need not be developed. Although Melito gives us the oldest testimony to the part played by the angel, there is no reason to think that an idea so evidently popular in origin owes its dissemination in any large measure to the influence of his homily. We may now consider briefly the ultimate origin of the story of the angel rending the curtain and leaving the temple. Noth- ing is better attested in the history of religions than the belief that an injury to a temple, an image, or anything belonging to a deity is a bad omen, betokening divine displeasure; 22 and that displeasure is given powerful expression when the deity forsakes the shrine where men have been wont to worship him. The rending of the veil, which destroys a barrier between what is holy and what is profane, is equivalent to emptying the sanc- tuary of the divine presence. As H. Laible puts it,23 "Der zerrissene Vorhang sah nicht anders aus, als ob das Allerheiligste aufgehtirt habe, Wohnung der Schechina zu sein, und als ob es vorbei sei mit dem auf dem Unterschied des Heiligen und Al- lerheiligsten beruhenden Tempeldienst." 24 That impression of the story has naturally led to a discussion of the question which curtain is meant, that before the Holy Place or that before the Holy of Holies. Zahn accepted the former view, which agrees with a combination which he makes, and to which he attaches some historical value, between the narrative of the canonical Gospels, that about the broken lintel, from the Gospel of the Hebrews, and the story told in Josephus and by some Talmudic writers, about the spontane- 22 For a single example, which bears a certain resemblance to the Gospel story, compare the story cited by Wetstein in his note on Matt. 27, 51 about the splitting of the peplos, upon which the servile Athenians had had representations of Demetrius embroidered along with those of Athena and Zeus; Plut. Dem. 12. 23 Neue Kirchliche Zeitschrift, XXXV (1924), 306. 24 The rabbinical doctrine (Bab. Yoma 21b, Goldschmidt's translation, III, 53; Jer. Taanith, 9, 1, Maccoth 9, 6; Schwab's translation, VI, 153, XI, 90) that the Shechinah, though present in the tabernacle and the first temple, was lacking in the second temple (and a fortiori in the temple of Herod?) was probably not consistently held.</page><page sequence="15">TWO PROBLEMS IN MELITO'S HOMILY 189 ous opening of the heavy doors of the temple.25 Laible 26 holds that the veil was that of the Holy of Holies, and the same view is taken by Strack and Billerbeck 27 in their note on Matt. 27, 51. This is not the place for further discussion of that problem; but the whole tendency of the story about the rent veil - pro- test against the slaying of the Messiah, final rejection of Israel - points to the veil of the Holy of Holies, the ancient sanctity of which is thus symbolically destroyed. If this interpretation is right, it implies the presence of an angel in the most holy place of the temple; and I know of no other direct testimony to the existence of such an idea. The angel that appeared to Zacharias (Luke 1, 11) was seen at the right of the altar of incense, in the Holy Place; Luke does not say that he came from the Holy of Holies. But we should per- haps remember that the word angel, while ordinarily denoting a messenger or minister of God, is sometimes, at least in earlier Hebrew literature, an evasive expression for God himself;28 and, since in Test. Benj. 9 it is "the Spirit of God" that is to leave the temple after the veil is rent, we can see that angel may merely represent an anthropomorphic conception of the divine essence.29 It is a curious fact that when Eusebius has occasion to say that the veil of the temple was rent at the crucifixion,30 he adds &amp;a-irp oi~ 6 'Ic~-rnros laropd yyocvaL Ka7T roisS 'O0'ov xpb6ovs. But what Josephus says 31 is that there was a violent earthquake, Kal LaoL-TL'VTOS rov ^,aoV ^/ yyos i7Xtov alirp'v 'XcayL4 KaL i roi 3o atXs 6i/E 'TrpoiEarv, and made him leprous because he had presumed to offer sacrifice like a priest. 26 Th.

Yoma 39 b) are cited by Zahn, pp. 740-741. - The question about the two veils was debated by Origen (on Matt., Comm. Ser. 138; Berlin ed., Vol. XI, 285-6), who decided in favor of the outer veil, chiefly because that view fits better with his "inner" interpretation of the happening. Jerome ep. 120 (to Hedybia) follows Origen. 26Neue Kirchliche Zeitschrift, XXXV (1924), 287-314. 2 Kommentar zum Neuen Testament aus Talmud und Midrasch. 28 So G. A. Barton, in Hastings ERE IV, 594-5; he finds (p. 596b) an example as late as Eccl. 5, 6. 29 For the idea of the Holy Spirit deserting Israel, compare the Midrashic inter- pretation of Eccl. 12, 7 (Midrasch Kohelet, p. 157 ed. Wiinsche). so Dem.

Among the most striking of these are the story that Titus pierced the veil with his sword, which drew blood from it,34 Josephus' account of the voice heard by John Hyrkanos, telling him of the victory of his sons,35 and, most impressive of all, the portents that foreshadowed the fall of Jerusalem - the noise and movements heard by the priests when they were within the temple, and the voices saying "Let us go hence." 36 Such legends teach us to understand the growth and the spread of the beliefs about the angel's flight from the temple. The following passage seems to be relevant to the foregoing discussion, in so far as it implies a belief in an angel dwelling in the sanctuary: M. Gaster, The Samaritans (London, 1925), p. 78. 'The Samaritans did not ascribe to angels any power whatsoever of good or evil. Their belief in them was, no doubt, limited to the few allusions in the Pentateuch, for they do not deny what is expressly stated in it, and therefore believe in angels as messengers of God; they know two or three, and speak of a fourth, whom they call Kebalai, a word which has hitherto puzzled all who have studied Samaritan doctrines, although the origin of this name is perfectly simple. It is a word which occurs in Num. iv. 20, where it says: 'They shall not enter the sanctuary lest they see the "covering up" of the Holy of Holies and die.' Now the Samaritans . . . translate the verse: 'lest they see Kebalai within the sanctuary and die.' The word Kebalai 'is a hapaxlegomenon, and was therefore misunderstood by them;' thus a new angel was created.' (A. D. N.) 82 One inclines to read XaltArpb?Tpov in Josephus' text, or else to omit )XMov, as Euse- bius does when he quotes the passage. 33 See Strack-Billerbeck, II, 78-79, on Luke 1, 11. 34 Midrasch Bereshith Rabba Par. X, Ch. 2, 1 (p. 42 Wiinsche); Bab. Gittin 56 b (tr. Goldschmidt, VI, 366-7). 86 Joseph. Ant. 13, 289. 36 Bell. Jud. 6, 299.</page></plain_text>
