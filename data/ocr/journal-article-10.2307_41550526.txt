We therefore take the opportunity to present, in addition to the usual Director's introduction with its flavour of the year in Greece, an overview of recent work at the School drawn from our annual open lectures. These lectures, which are a fundamental part of our reporting, both formally to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and our subscribers in the UK and informally to the wider academic community, are now delivered in Athens, Thessaloniki, London and, every two to three years, in Scotland too (in 2011 we were gener- ously hosted by the University of Glasgow). The School website, www.bsa.ac.uk, hosts a recording of the Athens lecture in a media library of all our major academic lectures, as well as the Annual Report to Subscribers which contains summaries of our field projects and other major activities. The annual lectures bring our work to life - and, as we celebrate 125 years of research in Greece, we hope that publication in this year's Archaeological Reports of a synthesis of the past two years' work (based on the 2011 Glasgow lecture) will remind a new generation of the role that the School can play for them. Anniversaries also encourage thinking about new direc- tions. As indicated last year, Archaeology in Greece is now taking its first steps towards becoming a more synthetic, reflective and accessible publication, building on the achievement of Archaeology in Greece Online ( AGOnline ) in providing quick access to authoritative accounts of primary data without constraint upon length or illustration. The desirability of this was clear last year, when one of the largest Archaeology in Greece supplements ever produced reproduced in their entirety the online texts and dominated Archaeological Reports , leaving scant room for anything else. Indeed, constraints of space in print meant that material from Attica was held over to 2011 both in print and online. There is no significant diminution in the available material this year. In addition to the regular volumes of AEMTh and the Ergon of the Archaeological Society, Ministry press releases and field reports from foreign Schools and Greek universities, an entire fascicule of Archaiologikon Deltion chronika is devoted to work in Attica from 2001-2004 (a period of major public works in preparation for the Olympic games). And while local journals have reported less archaeology this year, a number of Ephoreias have produced bulletins on work achieved with EU funding (the 5th EBA in Sparta, for example) and two major conferences held in 2006, Mesohelladika and KepaiJEiKjj tt}s 'Yorepris Apxcxi6rr]Tas and rov eXXabiKo x^opo (3°s-7°s ai. (J.X.), were published in 2010. It is neither easy nor desirable to be selective in reporting excavation findings, especially when they come from rescue work: limited information from a single building plot may in time come to form an essential part of a bigger picture when larger areas can be investigated. Assembling such evidence from short reports published over long periods and often with long delays can be complicated, but it is made much easier by the search and report linkage functions of AGOnline. Conversely, including all such data in print creates a dense and difficult text when ideally one would recapture some of the quality of the Archaeology in Greece of the 1960s and 1970s, when lines of thinking were clearer and trends and achievements more easily spotted. For this reason, we are now splitting Archaeology in Greece into AGOnline , the fundamental online reporting of primary data which remains the joint responsibility of the British School Director and the Director of the Ecole frangaise d'Athenes, and the Archaeology in Greece print supplement to Archaeological Reports , excellently described by its new editor, Zosia Archibald, as a first review of the new data. The AGOnline and AG teams have worked together to tight deadlines, and it has been both stimulating and a little terrifying to see the online data subject to immediate and intense academic scrutiny. One traditional function of the Director's introduction, to highlight key trends and major discoveries, has now largely passed into the hands of the review team. However, the greater emphasis on analysis and reflection in AG means that not all areas of Greece will necessarily receive equal treatment in any single year. Rather, we will take the opportunity to explore trends in data and to demonstrate how, over the course of a decade or more, discoveries may combine to change our understanding: this year, Maria Stamatopoulou's discussion of Demetrias is such a case. But annual highlights remain, and I will exercise the Director's prerogative to draw attention to a case of particular interest which is of a period and in a region which have received less attention than others this year. The sanctuary at Kalapodi continues to produce outstandingly well-preserved evidence of a sequence of buildings beneath the Archaic south temple. A trial trench in the adyton dug to bedrock revealed five mud-brick structures pre-dating the Archaic temple, the oldest of which dates back to LHIIIA2/B: four Mycenaean seals in steatite and glass are noted by the excavator, Wolf-Dietrich Niemeyer, as indicating a connection with the Mycenaean centre at Orchomenos 20km to the south. Its successor, temple 2, was in use in LHIIIC, and pottery found on a floor of temple 3 includes a skyphos-krater fragment with parallels from the Heroon at Lefkandi (i.e. of the first half of the 10th century). This also gives a terminus post quern for the construction of temple 4, on the floor of which was a fragmentary EGII skyphos. As yet, only temples 5 and</page><page sequence="2">2 CATHERINE MORGAN 6 (the Archaic temple) have been exposed to any substantial extent. Temple 5 is a double apsidal building with a thatched roof, built in the mid ninth century, which contained the in situ burnt remains of a wooden cult image before the west apse (Fig. 1). However one choses to place this in relation to literary traditions surrounding early xoana , it is of great significance as the first such discovery in an excavation context. The temple itself was ritually destroyed by fire in preparation for the construction of its successor, numerous bronze, iron and faience votives having previously been placed on its floor. Discoveries at Kalapodi in this and previous years are highly significant in their own right, but the long strati- graphical sequence must now be set against our devel- oping knowledge of wider regional patterns, with the decline of Orchomenos, the growth of large cemeteries nearby such as that at Elateia and the transformation in elite housing at more distant Lefkandi and Mitrou. The new form of AG also offers greater opportunities to broaden coverage beyond fieldwork and study seasons to report the major site conservation and presentation projects which have been such a focus of Ministry work over the past few years. Many of these have important research components and many have been well published: EU-funded projects in particular have been systematically reported, often in illustrated syntheses published by individual Ephoreias. A notable example is the report of the work of the 26th EBA in Messenia in 2007-2010 which includes a rich diversity of restoration and conser- vation, mostly of churches and icons, but also fortifica- tions such as the Niokastro at Pylos and the kastro of Kalamata. Further projects are in progress or newly approved as part of the National Strategic Reference Framework (EZTTA) programme (2007-2013) - the reroofing and conservation of the palace at Pylos, for example, conservation of the castle walls at Androusa in Messenia and the Larisa at Argos, site conservation and presentation at Abdera, the restoration of the theatre at Thasos and the restoration of the Palace of the Palaiologoi at Mystra scheduled for completion in 2013. The role of private bodies should also be acknowledged: for example, the Diazoma organization has made a major contribution to the preservation of Greek theatres, most recently advancing the full investigation and presentation of the theatre at Orchomenos and facilitating local appeals for sites such as the Amphiareion at Oropos. Here it is appropriate to record the publication of a number of important guide books and synthetic accounts of sites and regions. By region, we note: Athens and Attica: Ch.

Di Vita, Gortina di Creta: quindici secoli di vita urbana , Rome 2010. The development of Museums also continues apace, despite extensive press coverage of gallery closures and low levels of staffing even in major centres (the National Archaeological Museum being a cause for particular concern). The final gallery at Patras Museum is now fully open, as is the permanent display at the Byzantine and Christian Museum in Athens. New developments include long overdue provision for neglected areas of research: the Museum of Frankish Antiquities in Chlemoutsi Castle is a unique resource, the Byzantine Museum to be housed in the Kapodistrian barracks in Argos will be the first museum covering this period in the Peloponnese and it is particularly exciting to report the acceptance of the study for Greece's first museum of maritime archaeology as part of the Piraeus coastal development plan. The building chosen for this museum, the former SILO grain warehouse beside the Piraeus passenger port, is itself a monument of industrial archaeology, built in the 1920s and in use until 2010. In the museum world too, private benefaction plays a vital role - a recent example includes the conversion of four traditional school buildings at Pheneos in the Corinthia into a cultural centre with an archaeological and folklore museum supported by the Club Hotel Casino Loutraki (which also sponsors renewed excavation at Pheneos). The importance of developments in the museum sector has been emphasized in most recent editions of AG. It is therefore appropriate that the first edition of the new-style supplement should include within Maria Stamatopoulou's discussion of Thessaly a feature on new museums and displays generously illustrated by colleagues from several Ephoreias.</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 3 Three new museum guides may be noted: Th.

While there remains much cause for optimism in the quality and range of work being conducted in Greece against all economic odds, it is impossible to avoid the difficulties created by the crisis, with staff shortages widely evident and an increase in incidents of theft and illegal excavation reported by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The latter are seen as an economic opportunity, with thefts of coins and ecclesiastical artefacts in particular on the rise and significant seizures of larger items (especially sculpture) too. These include rare items and pieces of high market value, such as the head of a caryatid (with an estimated value of over five million euros) seized in Loutraki, and 10 icons stolen from monas- teries in Ioannina and Grevena and subsequently returned by galleries in London and Amsterdam. International collaboration, exemplified in 2011 by a new accord against the illicit antiquities trade between the USA and Greece, is of ever increasing importance. The potential damage caused by such activity extends beyond the objects themselves. As Daniel Stewart notes in his report on the Peloponnese below, the Tenea (Klenia) kouroi were seized in time to avoid further damage to their archaeological context. Other sites have been less fortunate: the press reported earlier in the year the use of dynamite to blast a 12m-long tunnel in a designated archaeological site at Seidi Vrysi Myrtophytou in search of Ottoman gold pounds. That such cases remain relatively rare is a tribute to the vigilance of the police and the Ministry. As is usual in this introduction, we include a list of conferences held in Greece and Cyprus through the year which may be of interest to readers of AG. Conferences focused on specific periods: On Cooking Pots, Drinking Cups, Loom Weights and Ethnicity in Bronze Age Cyprus and Neighbouring Regions, Leventis Foundation, Nicosia, November 2010. Conferences focused on sites or regions: Ninth Colloquium on Trikalinian Studies , Trikala, November 2010; Mycenaeans Up-to-Date: The Archaeology of the NE Peloponnese - Current Concepts and New Directions , Swedish Institute and University of Thessaly, November 2010; Second International Conference on Archaeological Research in Crete , 28th EBA, University of Crete, Archaeological Institute of Cretological Studies, November 2010; Edessa and the Surrounding Area.

In closing, I join my colleagues in the BSA AGOnline team, Robert Pitt (Assistant Director), Don Evely (Knossos Curator) and Penny Wilson Zarganis (Librarian) in welcoming the new AG editor, Zosia Archibald, and this year's specialist team of John Bennett, Bill Cavanagh, Archie Dunn, Robin Osborne, Maria Stamatopoulou and Daniel Stewart. Collectively we would like to express our thanks to our colleagues at the Ecole frangaise d'Athenes, and especially to Dominique Mulliez as he comes to the end of his tenure as Director. As an architect of AGOnline and a mainstay of the team throughout, he has been essential to the success of the project: we wish him well as he moves to the Sorbonne and look forward to welcoming his successor, Professor Alexandre Farnoux.</page><page sequence="4">4 CATHERINE MORGAN THE WORK OF THE BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS 2009-2010 Catherine Morgan British School at Athens This year we celebrate the 125th anniversary of the School's foundation, and in keeping with the spirit of the occasion, this review of our work over the past two years (2009-2010) will present our immediate achievements but in the context of our traditions, shifting focus and future plans.1 Indeed, we are taking the opportunity throughout 2011 to reflect upon the School's history in video presen- tations on our website, www.bsa.ac.uk, using our archival holdings. We hope that this will encourage members to share their memories of the School with the archivist to help us build an oral archive. We have also begun prepa- ration for a new institutional history. 2009-2010 has been a period of transition, with estab- lished field projects drawing to a close, new ones beginning, and new directions in our academic work and the manner of its presentation. There have been major changes in the way we convey research in Greece not only to the immediate School community - now over 1,000 people worldwide - but to those less closely connected with us. We are on Facebook, have a Youtube channel, but most importantly, our website has been redesigned to make easily accessible information about events, projects, bibliographical catalogues and databases (shortly to include topographical searching of bibliography in collab- oration with the German Archaeological Institute's Zenon project), catalogues of our collections and now a video library for research and teaching (Fig. 2). We aim to create a basic resource for Hellenic studies, with RSS feeds to enable readers to select the information they receive. Two major IT projects form part of this. Archaeology in Greece Online needs no introduction as the basis of this year's print Archaeology in Greece . Museums and Archives Online is gradually publishing cross-searchable catalogues of all our collections, from the Fitch Laboratory, Knossos, the Museum and Archive, beginning with the Byzantine Research Fund Archive and now including newly digitized photographs from Arta, Achaia, the Argolid, Boiotia, Euboia, Thessaloniki and Monemvasia. This is a major project, with much work remaining to catalogue and digitize large parts of our archival holdings. We are reliant on the work of interns, and are happy to offer opportunities to students consid- ering careers in archives or museums. Turning to our publications, Lakonia was the focus in 2009, with excavation reports from the Menelaion (by Hector Catling) and Ag. Stephanos (by the late Lord William Taylour), and the proceedings of the 2005 Sparta and Laconia conference. In 2010, we turned to Crete, with Cretan Offerings , the Festschrift for School vice- president Peter Warren, and volumes on Karphi and Palaikastro in press. Our monographs are now available on JSTOR, as is the School's Annual and Archaeological Reports , giving readers electronic access to all but our very latest publications. The Annual is also changing: from 2011 it will be produced by Cambridge University Press in print and electronic formats, with a facility for rolling e-publication which will be especially valuable for our science-based research. Among changes to the School's constitution in 2009, a Committee for Society, Arts and Letters was created to develop our non-archaeological research, of which we have a distinguished history as indicated by our 2009 publication Scholars , Travels , Archives edited by Michael Llewellyn Smith, Paschalis Kitromilides and Eleni Calligas. Naturally, there are many areas of common interest with our archaeological work. A major research focus is the Byzantine Research Fund (BRF), a unique archive of photographs, drawings and notes on Byzantine monuments across Greece and the Near East created mostly between 1880 and 1920 by architects trained in the Arts and Crafts tradition and based at the School (Fig. 3). Some of our research exploits the BRF for specific art historical themes. For example, the School Archivist, Amalia Kakissis, and BRF project assistant, Dimitra Kotoula, worked on the history of recording of Byzantine mosaics in Greece as part of a Leverhulme International Network on the composition of Byzantine glass mosaic tesserae directed by Liz James of the University of Sussex (Fig. 4). We also continue to exhibit the collection: in 2010, an exhibition, Architectural Trails through Byzantium , at the Lefa Gallery in Psychiko showed highlights of six monuments recorded by the Fund's architects - the Daphne Monastery and Panagia Gorgorepikoos in Attica, Ag. Demetrios, Ag. Georgios and Profitis Ilias in Thessaloniki, and Hosios Loukas Monastery in Phocis. It was accompanied by an educational outreach programme for all school levels. The Byzantine Research Fund continues to be the focus of the Archivist's research, in preparation for a conference and exhibition in London in 2013 which will examine the longer-term impact of the Byzantine Revival and the later commissions fulfilled by the BRF architects (Fig. 5). 1 The following account is based on lectures delivered by the Director in February 2010 and 2011 at the Archaeological Society of Athens, the Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki, the University of Glasgow and in London (in 2010 at the Centre for Hellenic Studies, King's College London, and in 2011 at the British Academy). The School is most grateful for the generous hospitality extended by the Secretary General of the Archaeological Society, Dr Vassileios Petrakos, by the Prytanis of the Aristotelian University and the staff of its Department of Archaeology, by the University of Glasgow (Department of Archaeology), by the former Director of the Centre for Hellenic Studies, Dr Karim Arafat, and by President of the British Academy, Professor Sir Adam Roberts. The British School expresses its warmest thanks for the unfailing support of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Dr Lina Mendoni, of the Director of Antiquities, Dr Maria Andreadaki Vlazaki, of the Director of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, Mrs Nikoletta Valakou, and of their staff. We particularly thank those in charge of the regions in which we undertook fieldwork and study in 2009-2010: Mrs Stavroula Apostolakou (Director, 24th EPCA, Ag. Nikolaos); Mrs Maria Bredaki and Dr Athanasia Kanta (successive Directors, 23rd EPCA, Herakleion); Dr Mariza Marthari (Director, 21st EPCA, Cyclades); Mrs Rosina Kolonia and Mrs Amalia Karapaschalidou (successive Directors, 11th EPCA, Chalkida); Dr Angeliki Simosi (Director, Ephoria of Maritime Antiquities); Mrs Adamantia Vasilogamvrou (Director, 5th EPCA, Sparta) and Mrs Kalliopi Diamanti (Director, 5th EBA, Sparta).</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 5 2. http://www.bsa.ac.uk. ■ An institute for advanced research'^^j^BLjA ' ■ ■ irT8* Tfffflf II rr-''Tr gSlv !

The School has jointly organized two conferences which reaffirm the importance of dialogue between humanities scholarship and public policy. In December 2010, we joined colleagues from Athens University and Oxford Brookes University in a workshop on Health and Society: Private and Public Medical Traditions in Greece and the Balkans at which scholars from Turkey and across the Balkans joined British and Greek historians to explore the social and medical history of the delivery of healthcare in a region where influences from the Ottoman and Arab east and Latin west intersect. The result was both important regional history and analysis liable to deepen our historical understanding of contemporary attitudes to public health.</page><page sequence="6">6 CATHERINE MORGAN This conference was our first to be published online (at http://pulse-project.org/HealthSociety), a practice which we are now continuing on our own website. Secondly, in January 2011 we joined the Hellenic Observatory of the London School of Economics in a workshop on Changing Conceptions of * Europe * in Modern Greece: Identities, Meanings , and Legitimation. Debate was certainly sharpened by the current crisis, on which former Prime Minister Costas Simitis reflected in an accompanying evening lecture in the British Embassy. But the meeting fulfilled our wider aim to add a historical and anthropo- logical depth to economic and political analysis. Many of the School's research collaborations in and beyond Britain and Greece fall under the remit of Society, Arts and Letters. In addition to our established collabora- tions with the American School of Classical Studies, we now share seminars with the Ecole frangaise d'Athenes in history and anthropology, and with the Research Centre for Greek Philosophy of the Academy of Athens. Plans for the next four years include collaborations with the British School at Rome and the Hellenic Institute in Venice on the cultural and artistic development of the Adriatic ports, with the British Council on the promotion of modern Greek literature after World War II, and with the Council for British Research in the Levant on perceptions of British authority from the Ionian government to the 4.

This last will make particular use of the Noel-Baker family papers in the School's archive, especially on issues of relief work and the independence of Cyprus (Fig. 6). The Noel-Bakers were not only distinguished British parliamentarians, but also the longest settled British family in Greece. Some five years ago the family kindly donated to the School the archive of their early years in Greece, including correspon- dence with Byron and Finlay. We are now particularly grateful to them for a further gift of correspondence, diaries and photographs mostly dating from World War I onwards, which includes a wealth of information on the 5.

Holders have ranged from estab- lished artists such as photographer Richard Billingham in the year of his Turner prize nomination or sculptor Tim Shaw, now well known for his work for the Eden Project and the Royal Opera House, as well as his Gulf War cycle Casting a Dark Democracy , to younger artists wanting to work in a different urban context or engage with the Greek landscape. The 2010-2011 award holder is the sculptor Brigitte Jurack of Manchester Metropolitan University, whose work explores youth as a period of uncertainty, unstable identity and sexual ambiguity (Fig. 7). The recently completed Eleutherios Studio in the Upper House attic, generously supported by Mr Lou Kollakis, is already helping us to expand the range of our activities and build new partnerships. 7. Two Girls. © Brigitte Jurack, 2010. The School continues to pursue an extensive programme of archaeological fieldwork and study at sites from east Crete to Thessaly. Many of the major projects reported in previous years - Keros, Karphi and Lefkandi for example - are in study phase and nearing completion. On Keros, work directed by Colin Renfrew (Cambridge) has focused on the development of the large Early Bronze Age settlement on Dhaskalio, the votive Special Deposit South (identifying imports and a distinctive pattern of off- site breakage of marble vessels and figurines) and on the typology of figurines, identifying a distinct Dhaskalio sub- variety dating to the latter part of the Early Bronze Age. And at Lefkandi, study under the direction of Irene Lemos (Oxford) has focused on the architectural development of the successive 'Megara' in Region I, the main residence from LHIIIC to the earlier phases of the Early Iron Age in an elite settlement area in the eastern part of Xeropolis (Fig. 8). Continuing study of the ceramic and architectural records has also confirmed the existence of later, Protogeometric settlement, with Middle to Late Protogeometric pebble surfaces defined in the northern part of Area P and a substantial apsidal building of the Late Protogeometric, possibly into Sub-Protogeometric period, restored in the south. Surfaces related to this structure remain elusive, but occupation and possibly an industrial installation are suggested by a clay mould, lead clamps and cooking vessels: the building also provides a context for the small figurine, probably a centaur, excavated in 2004. Overall, however, I can present here only highlights of our fieldwork programme: full reports on other sites can be found in Archaeology in Greece Online. At the Neolithic settlement at Koutroulou Magoula in northern Thessaly, a collaborative excavation and ethnog- raphy project directed by Nina Kyparissi-Apostolika (Ephoreia of Paleoanthropology and Speleology for Southern Greece) and Yannis Hamilakis (Southampton) began with a survey of the topography and visible remains, with attention to two major structures - Building 1 with at least three habitation phases and the larger Building 2 at the highest point of the settlement (Fig. 9). Agricultural activity has destroyed or obscured most evidence for terracing, but one surviving terrace on the north side could easily have accommodated a series of structures similar in size to Building 1. The principal phase of occupation dates to the Middle Neolithic, but the survey also documented post-Medieval remains. In 2010, Building 2 and areas outside its north, east and south sides were investigated to identify its earlier phases and provide stratified material from deposits pre- dating it. Building 2 was a robust rectangular structure with elaborately constructed walls and clay floors laid over a stone-paved deposit (see this year's Archaeology in Greece Fig. 18). It underwent a series of modifications and alterations: for example, the southern wall appears to have been deliberately removed (its existence is confirmed by the in-turn of the east wall at its southern end and the fact that the southern end of the floor foundation appears undamaged). These alterations will be explored further in future seasons. In the absence of internal features or informative finds, the function of the building cannot be determined, but its size, elaborate construction and probable repairs to its east wall suggest that it was an important and probably long-lived structure.

Similar practices have been discussed for the Neolithic of the Balkans. Rich deposits were excavated on the northeast side of Building 2, although they pre-date the building strati- graphically and offer no help in reconstructing its function or the activities that took place in or around it. Numerous finds include clay figurines, plain and decorated pottery, chipped and ground stone, animal bones and shell. Notable among finds from the main, Middle Neolithic, phase are clay figurines (more than 30 found in 2010) which when added to the high numbers collected in previous years means that Koutroulou Magoula has one of the largest collections of Neolithic figures from stratified</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 9 contexts in Greece. However, no clear association with specific features or other finds can yet be established. Excavation in 2010 also produced evidence for later occupation - Bronze Age pottery, a substantial quantity of Byzantine and Ottoman pottery and tile, and a 12th-century coin. There must have been considerable Byzantine activity, even though secure contexts are currently lacking. An extensive programme of environmental sampling and analysis accompanied the excavation. Soil micromor- phology was targeted to investigate the laying out of floors and the nature of some clay deposits. Initial assessment of the identifiable portion of the animal bone assemblage from the 2001-2010 seasons revealed 67% sheep/goat, 13% cattle, 10% pig and 0.8% dog. Tortoise, hare, roe deer and red deer are also found in smaller quantities. A number of scattered human bones were found mixed with animal bones, possibly indicating the circulation of human remains within the settlement. Analysis of botanical material from soil samples collected in 2009, from undisturbed excavation units and all types of contexts (floors, pits, postholes, pot contents, hearths, use layers), revealed a variety of species - cereals (einkorn, emmer and barley), legumes (lentil, pea and vetch), fruits and nuts (fig, terebinth, elder), herbs and various wild flora (edible and not). In parallel with the excavation, an ethnographic project combined investigation of local communities with that of their relationship to the material past. The community of Neo Monastiri is most closely associated with the site and the research team. Most inhabitants are refugees and descendants of refugees who arrived in the 1920s from former Anatoliki Romilia in modern Bulgaria. They hold strongly to a distinctive identity expressed primarily through language, dance and music, and previous ethno- graphic studies have concentrated mostly on those forms of expression. The archaeological ethnography strand of the present project is far wider, taking as its core elements material culture and notions of memory and temporality, and it has attracted widespread participation. A series of community activities and public archaeology events was also organized, many in collaboration with a revived local association of friends of antiquities originally established to promote the archaeological site of the acropolis of Proerna. Material from the Koutroulou excavations also forms an important part of the post-doctoral research of the Fitch Laboratory's Williams Fellow in Ceramic Petrology, Areti Pentedeka. Building upon her doctoral research on pottery exchange networks in Thessaly, and in collaboration with Eva Alram-Stern of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, John Coleman of Cornell University and the regional Archaeological Service departments, Areti is analysing selected assemblages from central Greece and Thessaly to shed light on intra- and extra-regional connectivity as expressed in material culture, especially pottery. Koutroulou Magoula lies in the heart of the interface region, and the project also draws on finds from Wace and Thompson's excavations at Lianokladi and Tsangli. This combination of projects marks the School's return to this part of Greece after a gap of almost a century. Moving south to Lakonia, the Pavlopetri Underwater Archaeological Project, directed by Elias Spondylis (Ephoreia of Maritime Antiquities) and Jon Henderson (Nottingham), aims to outline the history and development of what was probably the main port of entry to the southeast Peloponnese during the Bronze Age and to explain how the town and the Strait of Elaphonisos became submerged. The site was first surveyed in 1968 by a team from the University of Cambridge. The resulting plan showed around 15 separate buildings, courtyards, streets, two chamber tombs and at least 37 cist graves. The site was seen to continue south onto Pavlopetri Island, where the remains of walls and other archaeological material were visible. The relatively few surface finds then collected from the seabed suggested a date from the Early to the Late Bronze Age. On the basis of comparison with other known sites, the submerged buildings were thought to date mainly to the Mycenaean period. A full survey of the architectural remains has now been completed, using Sector Scan Sonar (to produce a 3D digital survey of the submerged features) and a shore-based Total Station. The major innovation in 2010 was the first use on an archaeological site of a stereo-vision mapping system designed by the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (Fig. 10). This is capable of producing photo- realistic, textured 3D maps and models of features on the seabed. Stereo-cameras obtain measured 2D photo- mosaics of areas of the seabed which are then processed using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping software to produce 3D models. Multi-beam sonar on the diver rig obtains 3D data on seabed surfaces that can be combined with the stereo-photogrammetric data. In 2010 priority was given to recording areas of the highest archaeological importance. A total of 47 dives gathered more than 135,000 pairs of stereo images. Post-processing of this large quantity of data is expected to take at least a year, but preliminary results are extremely encouraging. One 15 x 30m survey box (built of 6,315 stereo image pairs) contains parts of Street 1 and the so-called Megaron, both clearly seen in both the photo-mapped and depth-coloured views (see this year's Archaeology in Greece Fig. 30). Here we see an overhead view of another mesh of Chamber Tomb 1, located on the bedrock ridge to the northeast of the city (Fig. 11). This tomb was cut from the surrounding bedrock, producing a structure with large depth variations. These results suggest that the 3D reconstructions are highly suitable for archaeological interpretation, both as a visually coherent composite view of the site and as a 3D model. The ability to produce geometrically accurate photo- realistic maps and models of submerged archaeological features has the potential to revolutionize the practice of underwater archaeological survey. 10.

Pavlopetri: photo-mosaic of Chamber Tomb 1. © BSA (Pavlopetri Underwater Archaeological Project). The visible architectural remains at Pavlopetri begin some 20m from the shore at Pounda Beach and run over 300m south to Pavlopetri Island (Fig. 12). They are bounded to the east by a bedrock ridge, running north to south, and to the west by extensive sand deposits and deeper water (no remains have been identified in water more than 3m deep). Beyond the island and the eastern ridge the sea is deeper, and no artificial constructions can be traced. No indications of harbour constructions or jetties have yet been identified. The town appears as a series of large spreads of stones indicating building complexes, amongst which is a network of stone walls built of uncut aeolianite, sandstone and limestone blocks without mortar. These stone foundations were originally around lm high and supported superstructures of mud-brick and/or timber frames covered in plaster. The eastern bedrock ridge has protected the remains from the full force of wave action over the years (most walls are in the same condition as observed during the initial prospection in 1968), but wherever there are gaps in the ridge, walls have been eroded either completely away or flush with the seabed. In addition to recording the 30,000m2 of buildings first identified in 1968, 9,000m2 of new structures were discovered to the north of the original remains in 2009. These consist of at least 25 co-joined square and recti- linear rooms, plus a 40m-long street lined with rectilinear buildings. One square (3 x 3m) building contains the remains of a central pillar-like structure reminiscent at first sight of the pillar crypts of Minoan Crete. Two cist graves and what appears to be a Bronze Age pithos burial were found in a corner of one of these newly discovered rooms. One of the most important new finds is a large trapezoidal building, some 34m long and 12-1 7m wide, containing at least three separate rooms. This is comparable in layout to Early Bronze Age megara, and its large dimensions imply that it was of some importance. In 2010 a further 5,000m2 of construction were found to the south of the 1968 plan, with at least seven buildings clustered along a street and four new cist graves, bringing the site total to 43. These remains were probably covered by sand in previous years. Changes in sand cover may relate to changes in the position and shape of the shoreline over time, causing variability in wave action. Equally, the map of the bathymetry and topography of the town and the eastern bedrock ridge shows low gaps in the ridge where wave action would pass through and be diffracted and refracted round Pavlopetri Island itself and the other high points. This would result in a focusing of wave energy at discon- tinuous points over the town and the adjacent beach, with a pattern of high and low energy determined by the recent wave direction. Revisiting the site in future years and at different seasons may therefore reveal further parts of the Bronze Age town at present under thick beds of sand. Plainly, Pavlopetri is a larger and more important town than previously thought. Visible remains of intact building foundations, monumental structures, courtyards, streets, cist graves and rock-cut tombs now cover some 4ha. Scattered sections of wall confirm that the fully built-up area extended as far as Pavlopetri Island, and since many more buildings are likely hidden under the sand, the original size of the settlement may be at least 8ha. In an innovative collaboration, the BBC has been filming a documentary for release in 2011. Part of that project involves the production of CGI reconstructions using the survey data, which illustrates how the quality of data now being obtained can support both academic research and popular outreach. The pottery collected so far, while not stratified, covers the entire site and provides a clear picture of occupation history. Its breakdown by period shows a heavy bias to Early Bronze Age, followed by Late Bronze Age. Initial occupation can now be dated to the Final Neolithic, most probably on the Neolithic/Early Bronze Age transition. The Early Bronze Age pottery covers all sub-phases of the period, with a range of pithoi and storage jars decorated with an impressive repertoire of rope- and finger-impressed patterns, plus the standard cups, sauce- boats, conical saucers, portable hearths and dishes. Significantly for our understanding of relations between Pavlopetri and the Aegean, some pottery shows close links with the Cyclades. In contrast to the limited picture of Middle Bronze Age occupation obtained in 1968, finds now cover all sub-phases and include locally produced wares and a few imports, possibly from nearby Kythera. The Late Bronze Age pottery spans the full sequence to LHIIIC Middle. The Neopalatial material, both imported and local, shows close affinities with finds from Kythera and Crete. Sporadic later finds date to the Late Geometric, Classical, Roman and Byzantine periods. Architectural materials lifted include parts of roof and drainage tiles, mud-brick and clay settings for roof rafters. The School's return to Pavlopetri is a significant devel- opment in our long history of Lakonian research, from the Lakonia survey to Ag. Stephanos and beyond. As a major port of entry, Pavlopetri also links with projects on Antikythera and Kythera in which the Fitch Laboratory plays a leading role. The Kythera Island Project and the role of science-based archaeology within it was the subject of the 2011 Athens lecture Voyage to Kythera : Surveying the Island's Past, 1998-2010 by Fitch Director Evangelia Kiriatzi (broadcast at http://www.bsa.ac.uk/pages/ media_lib.php?cat_id=95).

Kouphovouno is best known for its Neolithic settlement, but excavation revealed possible Roman habitation to the west, and in 2010, preparatory resistivity and magnetometer surveys were undertaken in this area by Rebecca Sweetman (St Andrews). Results show a probable kiln or furnace with collapsed walls, circular features in the magnetometer data which may also be kilns or furnaces and probable terraces or paths. The School's research centre at Knossos continues to host a number of projects including curation of the holdings of the Stratigraphical Museum on which we employ museum studies interns. One major research strand combines reappraisal of old data with targetted new fieldwork. The Kephala Project directed by Peter Tomkins (Universities of Sheffield and Leuven) aims to publish the Neolithic stratigraphy, architecture and ceramics of Knossos, and to reconstruct the sub-surface Prepalatial stratigraphy and architecture. Recent insights into ceramic phasing are applied to the large archive of pottery from excavations dating back to 1900, by Arthur Evans and Duncan Mackenzie, and later John Evans (among others). New light is being shed on the nature and timing of the growth of the Neolithic settlement via a combination of archival research, macroscopic ceramic study, geophysical survey and GIS modelling of the Kephala Hill which relates more than 200 separate excavations in three dimen- sions. The hill originally consisted of two knolls, connected by a saddle to form a north-south ridge beneath the west wing of the Palace. The earliest settlement phases (Initial and Early Neolithic) were focused on the gently sloping terrain immediately east and southeast of this ridge, and ran up and probably over the saddle. Ever since the work of Evans, it has been assumed that the extensive levelling and terracing, which transformed the hill from a place of residence to a place of ceremony, was associated with the construction of the MMI palace. It now appears that the transformation occurred more gradually, in a series of episodes. The earliest (at the very end of the Final Neolithic) created a formal open space or court on the site of the later Central Court, flanked to the west by two houses. By EMI, these houses had been rebuilt or modified and the court surface relaid, while the entire northern slope of the hill had been transformed into a series of wide east-west terraces, stepping down from around the level of the present Central Court to that of the present North Front (Fig. 13). The EMI-II deposits on these terraces have generally been considered mixed fills, but it is now clear that some are stratified floor deposits associated in some cases with architecture. An EMI house can be reconstructed below, and to the east of, the North East Hall, on the basis of pottery from the 1903 and 1905 tests, from walls sketched by Fyfe and from walls still visible on the site today. Similarly, EMIIA or IIB struc- tures lie below the North Portico, around the North Lustral Area and below the North East Magazines. A series of tests around the Early Keep revealed a massive and deep Neolithic (MN-FNI) and Early Minoan fill, which provides a terminus post quem of EMIII for the construction of the Keep. Elsewhere around the hill there is evidence for additional, major terracing operations in EMIIA early and late, EMIIB, EMIII and MMIA. The present Central Court rests on a sequence of terraced platforms and probably reached its present extent some time late in the Early Minoan period. In 2009, a geophysical survey of the Kephala Hill was conducted in collaboration with Dick van der Roest (GT Frontline) and the Free University of Amsterdam, with the aim of mapping and visualizing the sub-surface archaeo- logical and geological deposits. The prospection system combined a transverse-mounted Ground Penetrating Radar antenna with Direct Contact continuous measurement of minor differences in the natural potential of the earth, giving very high-resolution, shallow and deep measurement, irrespective of the conductivity of the soil. Data collected covered the entirety of the fenced area of the archaeological site. The long process of interrogating the complete dataset for features and correlating them with the archaeological GIS continues, so the following obser- vations are open to revision. Below the Central Court, a dense array of features was detected at depths down to ca. 4.5m, including an enigmatic feature apparently on the same orientation as the Court and possibly thus belonging to an earlier phase of the Palace. The Direct Contact image also shows a set of linear features which is probably even deeper. Below the southern half of the Central Court are the walls of two large structures, oriented northeast-southwest, parallel to the contours of the bedrock and separated by a wide northeast- southwest passage. There is a strong likelihood that the 13. FNIV-EMI houses, court and southeast platform (Stratum IB) below the Central Court at Knossos. © BSA (P. Tompkins).</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 13 southernmost of the two structures belongs to the very earliest phase of occupation at Knossos ( ca . 7000-6500/6400 BC) - this is the structure widely reported as the earliest known farmer's dwelling in Greece, if not Europe. Images from other areas of the hill confirm that coherent, high-resolution imaging of walls and structures is by no means confined to the Central Court area. The Knossos Urban Landscape Project (or KULP), an intensive survey of the entire protected archaeological zone of the Knossos valley into the suburbs of modern Herakleion (directed by Maria Bredaki and Antonis Vasilakis, then of the 23rd EPCA, and Todd Whitelaw of University College, London), has been the centrepiece of the School's work at Knossos for some years. The combi- nation of data from the first phase of survey with over a century of excavation in the valley gives a wholly new perspective on the long-term development of the site, and opens the way for a series of specialist studies of specific periods and resources which will now follow. Todd Whitelaw's 2011 London open lecture, Surveying the Labryinth: the Knossos Urban Landscape Project 2005-2010, is available at www.bsa.ac.uk/pages/ media_lib.php?cat_id=95. An important aim of KULP is to define more precisely gaps in our knowledge and thus help to formulate new research. After over a century of continuous fieldwork at Knossos, the Bronze Age town remains perhaps the least understood sector of the site on a large scale. A new project to investigate the suburbs of Knossos (directed by John Bennet of the University of Sheffield, Amy Bogaard of the University of Oxford and Eleni Hatzaki of the University of Cincinatti) was begun in 2010 on the Lower Gypsades Hill, an area which probably represents the outer suburbs of the settlement, bounded above and to the south by cemeteries. It illus- trates well the strong framework provided by combining information from the urban survey and from earlier archaeological interventions. A magnetometer survey covering some 14.5ha in July 2010 was supplemented in January 2011 with resistivity in selected areas (see this year's Archaeology in Greece Fig. 110). In the Fitch Laboratory, 2009-2011 has seen major changes as well as progress in completing existing projects and developing new ones which expand the scope and geographical coverage of the laboratory's research. A postgraduate training course in ceramic petrology was introduced in 2010, combining petrology, the location and processing of raw material, and an introduction to ethno- graphical aspects of pottery production. And long-held plans for the laboratory's infrastructure were realized with the installation of a new Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence instrument. Extensive changes to the premises where made to meet the specifications of the new technique resulting in a major reconfiguration of space to house our expanding activities and the growing number of researchers using our facilities (Fig. 14). In 2008, the Fitch initiated a Senior Visiting Fellowship to broaden links with academic departments worldwide. The first holder, Vassilis Kilikoglou (NCSR Demokritos), undertook research on the geochemical characterization of Iron Age pottery from Knossos and Sybrita in central Crete. The second, Kostalena Michelaki (then McMaster), examined the influence of data format, methodology of data analysis, and the kinds and numbers of elements included in multivariate analytical methods on establishing ceramic chemical groups. She also analysed chemical and mineralogical data from prehistoric ceramics from the Bova Marina Archaeological Project in south- western Calabria (a joint project of the Universities of Cambridge and Leicester). Comparative analysis of ceramics from four Neolithic and Bronze Age sites showed that although potters had access to at least four or five distinct kinds of clay close to their settlements, they did not use them indiscriminately, but targeted particular clays for the production of particular kinds of ceramics. And the third Fellow, Eva Panagiotakopoulou (Edinburgh), worked on insect remains, notably from Dispilio. Research at the Fitch is so extensive that here I merely sample its main directions. The Research Fellow in Archaeological Chemistry, Myrto Georgakopoulou, has continued research into the origin of 'large-scale' metal production in the southern Aegean during the Early Bronze Age, focused on Siphnos. Evidence for copper, lead and silver production has been identified within and around the Early Bronze Age site of Akrotiraki. Analysis of these finds, and comparison with material from the renowned lead/silver production site of Ag. Sostis in northeast Siphnos, suggests distinctive geochemical signa- tures for the lead slags from the northern and southern parts of the island. Prospection for potential ore sources in the south of the island involved walking geologically plausible areas, revisiting ancient mine galleries identified in the 1970s and sampling comparative material. As part of the Kythera Island Project, Myrto Georgakopoulou is exploring the potential of metallurgical remains (mostly iron slags) found during survey in recon- structing ancient metallurgical practices. The project faced the twin challenges of the macroscopic and analytical similarities of many iron slag fragments, irrespective of production stage, and the inability to date them directly. The approach taken combines macroscopic study of all metallurgical finds from the survey, field evaluation and sampling of ore resources on Kythera (a rather poor landscape), and chemical and microstructural analyses of a sample of slags and comparative ores. The survey pottery assemblages were used to date by associ- ation the main periods of metallurgical activity. During the Classical period, metallurgy is encountered at around a quarter of survey sites, suggesting widespread activity with some specialization between sites. The nature of activity (smelting, primary and/or secondary smithing) cannot always be deduced (Fig. 15). But it is interesting to note evidence of smelting on Kythera, and that the scale of production (a total of 45kg of slag mostly from 22 sites) 14. Fitch Laboratory: sample preparation room.</page><page sequence="14">14 CATHERINE MORGAN 15. Slag types possibly relating to smithing and smelting activities (plan-convex bottoms and flow textures). © BSA (M. Georgakopoulou). contrasts markedly with that at neighbouring Neapoli in the same period, where estimates of thousands of tons of slag suggest a different organization of production. A series of projects on pottery of all periods from Neolithic to Venetian has been conducted by the Laboratory Director and the successive Williams Fellows, Marie-Claude Boileau and Areti Pentedeka, in particular concerning Aegina, Kythera, Crete (Knossos and Sybrita) and north Syria. In addition to her work in Thessaly, Areti Pentedeka is investigating pottery production and trade from prehistory to Late Antiquity in the central Ionian islands, an area largely unexplored in terms of archaeo- logical science. The initial focus is on Ithaca as a strategic point within maritime networks linking the Peloponnese, northwestern Greece and southern Italy, and within local networks between Leukas, Kephallonia and the Akarnanian coast. Some 200 Neolithic to Late Roman samples have been taken from old BSA excavation assem- blages, the recent Stavros valley survey and from projects of the 35th EPCA. In parallel, raw material prospection and sampling provided a basis for characterizing local products. Preliminary results of petrographic analysis yield interesting information for all periods. Our present focus is on the Roman period, since from Early Roman times onwards, coarsewares, notably cooking pots, present an unprecedented variability in fabric. We wish to assess the impact of this trade on the output of local workshops, especially during the period of settlement growth following the decline of Nikopolis (itself a major source of imports). To set these results in context, a parallel study of Middle and Late Roman assemblages from Fiskardo and Sami on Kephallonia is in progress. Archaeobotanical work in the Fitch was pursued by Leventis Fellow Evi Margaritis, whose research focuses on the cultivation history of the olive and vine. Analysis of large-scale and well-dated archaeobotanical assemblages of olive and vine recovered from sites across Cyprus, the Aegean and mainland Greece forms the basis for the creation of reliable models and criteria with which to distinguish wild from domesticated olive and vine, and to detect direct archaeobotanical evidence for early wine and olive oil production. She completed analysis of material from the School's excavation of Early Bronze Age Dhaskalio on Keros, where stratified olive and grape remains, together with an abundance of olive charcoal, indicate intensive human exploitation of both plants. Through collaboration with Martin Jones (Cambridge), research into modern and ancient olive and grape DNA is being pursued to elucidate the evolutionary history of fruit trees, their geographical origin and expansion in antiquity, and connections between ancient and modern varieties. Evi Margaritis is also associated with the British School at Rome through her participation in the Portus project, where she is jointly responsible for the environmental reconstruction of the site through time. To illustrate Fitch research in geophysics, I note a project completed in 2009-2010 by Michael Boyd, Honorary Fellow in Geophysics. At Plataia in Boeotia, the team has made remarkable discoveries at a site whose surface remains are so scant. The outline of the Late Classical, Hellenistic and Roman town has been clearly delineated, including the location of the agora with its public monuments and that of other important public buildings and private dwellings. The final season covered zones of the site further from the centre, as well as filling out some of the central area. Some 5.5ha were surveyed, bringing the overall total to 27ha (32% of the enclosed area) - the largest resistivity survey to date in Greece. A magnetometer survey of ca. 5ha was also completed over the lifetime of the project. The final season added to our knowledge of the northern gateway, of the extent of urban build-up (no more than 50% of the enclosed area was ever occupied) and added a new locus of occupation on the east side of the site. I close with brief mention of two workshops which drew together the key theoretical and methodological themes that characterize Fitch research in recent years. The first, on Recent Approaches to the Study of Pottery: from Prehistory to Byzantine Times , co-organized with the Universities of Thessaloniki, Thrace and Cincinnati, pooled the experience of those working on different periods in relation to contemporary theoretical and methodological developments. The variety of approaches and topics is remarkable, but the Fitch emphasis on bringing questions and approaches current in prehistory to bear on post-prehistoric and indeed Medieval data is central to current trends. The second, on Mobile Technologies across Dynamic Landscapes: Perspectives from Mediterranean Prehistory , reflects longstanding Fitch involvement in developing approaches and methodologies to integrate scientific techniques into the investigation of technological change at local, regional and inter-regional levels (Fig. 16). Fifteen speakers from Europe and North America explored different aspects of technological mobility in the prehistoric Mediterranean - with compar- ative insights also from contemporary sub-Saharan Africa. 16.

Fitch Laboratory Workshop, December 2010.</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 15 OVERVIEW - THE IDEA OF PLACE Zosia Archibald School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool The purpose of the new paper format of Archaeology in Greece {AG) is to enable readers to have a clear summary and preliminary analysis of the new content of the online data. It is now much easier to cull information about individual sites and projects from the BSA and EfA's online resource, Archaeology in Greece Online , where primary information is clearly set out (according to the year in which the fieldwork took place or, failing that, in which information was first released),1 the chronological scope of the work described, and plans, images and bibli- ographic references made available. This facility makes it possible to provide a far more comprehensive picture of the changing nature of archaeological research in the field than any previously published reports. The online resource cannot, however, provide a survey of the constantly accumulating flow of information. Scholars and researchers need to understand how the overall picture of archaeological research is changing and what kinds of data to look for online. The printed version of AG is intended to fill this gap. It will provide the first reference point for archaeological field research in Greece. It also provides an opportunity to review current trends, to explore research objectives and to suggest new enquiries that deserve to be followed up in the light of current research. That said, a survey is not a panacea, but a snapshot. New publications and news reports of discoveries continue to be received. For the purposes of this survey, the contributors have used material that has been made available until the end of June 2011 and have focused their evaluations mainly, though by no means exclusively, upon the previous 12 months. In future editions of AG we hope to provide a measure of depth as well as immediacy. It is often hard to give credit to important new finds, and to put these into a coherent context, when information is still of a preliminary kind. The content of former AG reports has been limited by the publication schedules of the major Greek journals and this will continue to be one of the organizational factors that shape the content of reports here. AR 56 (2009-2010) was an exceptionally full report, and the current year is hardly more limited (see Introduction for further discussion). Furthermore, the range of primary field data and summaries is balanced this year by a range of publications, covering different chrono- logical periods, which present in-depth studies of material data, allowing contributors to take stock of new infor- mation in the light of these systematic studies. Sites listed in AGOnline appear in bold in the texts below, while search codes are shown with the prefix ID-. The new design for AG makes it possible to include perspectives on Greek archaeology that could not be included in the old format. Future editions will explore the results of recent research on palaeobotanical evidence and of other relevant scientific techniques (Bill Cavanagh reports below on the results of recent analyses of ancient DNA, or aDNA). There will be more opportunities to explore the value of emerging new techniques, such as the digital technology applied at Pavlopetri, in the southern Peloponnese, to record underwater features spatially. More space will be allocated to presenting new displays in museums and more emphasis will be given to the variety of information that can be derived from artefacts. The new AG is not an anonymized text. Different researchers bring different skills and different ways of appreciating the new information that is emerging from fieldwork. The contributors to the new format therefore present the data in terms of their own experience and knowledge. We hope that this will help readers to under- stand how given interpretations have emerged (indeed, to understand why interpretations may, on occasion, differ). In this issue, Bill Cavanagh, who was co-director of the Laconia Survey and is currently co-directing fieldwork at Kouphovouno, arguably the best candidate site to have acted as a precursor to ancient Sparta, reflects on recent investigations of early prehistoric activities in Greece and on how scientific techniques can best be applied and integrated with traditional forms of investigation. John Bennet, whose research on Bronze Age Greece, and Crete in particular, will be well known to readers of AG, surveys Crete. The Assistant Director of the BSA, Robert Pitt, is more familiar with the latest developments in and around the city of Athens than most visiting archaeolo- gists and has compiled the new online datasets for Athens and Attica. He therefore provides readers of AG with an eye-witness view (as well as a scholarly perspective) on what might otherwise appear a confusing mass of urban keyhole surgery. Having a close interest in the inter-relationship between historical and archaeo- logical data, Dan Stewart, field director of the Sikyon Survey Project, whose research has focused particularly on the Roman Peloponnese, is well placed to analyse current trends in the Peloponnese between the Archaic period and the end of the Roman Empire. Maria Stamatopoulou has worked extensively in Thessaly and provides an up-to-the-minute report on the latest devel- opments in and around the Gulf of Pagasai, including an account of the Linear B tablet retrieved from Palaia Volou. I have worked in and published on Macedonia and Thrace for a good number of years and it is a pleasure to present the area at a time when there is a stock of impressive results to consider. Archie Dunn, who specializes in Byzantine and post-Byzantine history in the Balkan region, provides a round-up of recent research on the later periods, which shows how subsequent histories both map onto and differ from what we know of the same locations in antiquity. I would also like to pay tribute to Robin Osborne, who has assisted in the prepa- ration of copy and provided valuable advice at various stages of the project, activities that are not directly visible to readers of AG. Diachronic perspectives are like a game of four- dimensional chess. If we want to follow spatial dynamics, we may miss something vital in terms of contextual specifics, and vice versa. The division of data 1 Field reports should be searched for by their activity date, which determines the volume of Archaiologikon Deltion (the primary source for field information in Greece) in which they are regis- tered. Volumes often appear with some delay in relation to the year of activity. The first part of ADelt 56-59 (2001-2004) appeared in 2011, covering Athens and Attica. Reports in other publications may appear earlier than their registration in ADelt. Press releases may well be the first form of information released to the public and as such appear in the relevant year of activity.</page><page sequence="16">16 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD derived from the online archive into two sections, the 'chronological overviews' and the regional reports, is intended to provide some means of getting around this problem. The current format follows a broadly chrono- logical scheme in both the 'overview' and regional sections, whilst allowing themes to emerge where they seem most appropriate. This arrangement partly reflects the speed with which the contributors have been obliged to work for this copy of the report. In future we hope to diversify this structure in ways that better reflect the nature of current research. The tight timetable and the novelty of the process have prevented us from including all the material that we would have liked. It has not been possible to prepare maps alongside the narratives. We plan to rectify this gap next year and to apply what we have learned from the experience of working with the online data. In this issue we look at both ends of the chronological spectrum, with overviews of the Greek mainland in the prehistoric period on the one hand and Byzantine Greece on the other. Early periods of prehistory are well repre- sented in the regional accounts for Crete, Athens and Macedonia, as well as in Bill Cavanagh's review. The expansion of research on Medieval and early modern Greece, sponsored by a wide range of cultural groups as well as research organizations, ensures that later periods will play an increasing role within AG. The regional surveys focus on those areas for which there are substantive primary publications in 2010-2011: Attica, the Peloponnese, Crete, Thessaly and Macedonia. We cannot do full justice to the activities continuing in central Greece, the Ionian and Cycladic islands, the Dodecanese, the northern Aegean and Epirus. Detailed reports are planned for future editions of AG. Meanwhile, published data that are available online will be referred to selectively in this overview. What follows below is intended to stimulate exploration of the online archive. Bill Cavanagh opens our reflections on the changing face of ancient material remains in Greece. Reconstruction of the earliest human settlement of southern Europe and the Aegean islands requires imagi- native concepts as well as the accumulation of datasets. When were the islands and peninsular regions of Greece repopulated after the withdrawal of glacial conditions in the early Holocene? The answer to the question ' when ' is closely connected to the issue of how the process took place. Was it a single process or a series of inter-related processes? With little more than a handful of Mesolithic sites on which to base an evaluation, there is still a good deal of room for interpretation. Any one addition to the list can make a big difference to the way we think about the phenomenon as a whole. One thing that is becoming more apparent, and is exposed in more detail in the two reports that focus on prehistoric remains (The Greek mainland in the prehistoric period and Crete), is the evidence that seacraft and maritime connections in the Mesolithic, long suspected from the presence of Melian obsidian in the Franchthi cave, must be seen as funda- mental developments of this period (fully reflected in the practice of tuna fishing, which requires greater social coordination and planning than opportunistic family ventures). There is more to the question of how these processes evolved than meets the eye. In thinking about place - places that acquired a semi-permanent fixity in the memory and consciousness of resident groups - we are forced to consider what 'place' means in a cultural setting. Places were from the beginning imagined landscapes, loci of association. The association of places and ideas is picked up in Dan Stewart's report on Kanakia, on Salamis and Troizen, where Bronze Age constructions were re-used in the first millennium BC, but in very different ways - on the one hand to reinforce associations with a remote past (in terms of what may be a shrine to Ajax); and on the other simply as a pragmatic resource that could be put to new use. The notion of place is critical to archaeological inter- pretation. Artefacts and structures are impoverished without contextual associations. Yet we are prone to detach conversations about culture, particularly about Greek and Roman culture, from specific settings, despite the fact that cultural expressions are defined by rootedness, by chosen contexts. The separability of ancient texts from their originating situations has made a virtue of the process of translation (linguistic, temporal and spatial), thereby reducing the urgency of compre- hending the contexts in which they arose. The contexts of cultural production are worth studying in their own right, because they enable us to recapture a nuanced under- standing of the past. Writing these words in Edinburgh, where the annual International Festival brings to the Athens of the north' in 2011 an extraordinary, indeed unprecedented, array of actors, dancers, writers and musicians, whose roots are in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, as well as festival-goers from all over the globe, the lesson of context is not lost. The biographies of the contributors reflect just how individual the journeys have been to this programme of shared genres and languages. The mentors and teachers of each artist, and the artists themselves, have highly specific backgrounds, reflecting the specialized nature of their crafts. Students travel to the place where not just any teacher, but that particular teacher is to be found. These private journeys are less apparent in the created product, but remain immanent in the landscape of creation, to be exploited in other ways. In a contemporary context, the immanence of past human encounters is often commemorated in narratives, real or imagined. Thus, in Edinburgh, the notorious body- snatchers Burke and Hare or the thief Deacon Brodie jostle in the imagination of visitors with great men and women - Alexander Graham Bell, David Hume, David Lister, John Napier, Eduardo Paolozzi, Mary Queen of Scots, Mary Somerville and Muriel Spark (and, most recently, J.K. Rowling, commemorated in the Elephant Cafe where her fiction began to emerge). Reputations are connected with places in modern cities through various media. Colourful characters have public houses named after them. Sober blue plaques and street names herald others. Street signs are not an appropriate way of thinking about people and places in the remote past. The language of street signage is a modern phenomenon and is still largely absent in many international towns and cities. Although topographic features, such as rivers, trees and roads are referred to in the context of ancient land disputes, we are largely ignorant of the ways in which places were recognized in the remote past. Satellite mapping may be speeding up the process of reproducing terrain in other materials; but reliance on satellite maps is apparently reducing the individual's capacity to under-</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 17 stand topography. This seems to imply that historic communities had a greater awareness of more subtle topographic characteristics. There are various ways in which scholars can explore the idea of topographic recog- nition in past societies and a range of theories and methods that might be applied. Which of these are best suited to understanding the topography and people of ancient Greece? Different approaches tend to amplify different preoccupations. We can acknowledge this methodological handicap, whether or not we choose to develop a more in-depth, theoretically informed approach to how people used to think about their environment (on which see, for example, Barrett and Ilhong [2009]). Landscape and memory have been explored most inten- sively, in the context of the ancient Aegean, in connection either with literature and commemorative monuments (particularly during the Second Sophistic) or with the re- use of architectural components, although the range of scholarly approaches to landscape and memory is very wide indeed. I will mention only a few recent titles by way of illustration: Alcock (2002); Athanassopoulos and Wandsnider (2004); Caraher et al. (2008); D'Agata and Van de Moortel (2009); Davies and Davis (2007); Eisner and Rutherford (2005); Forbes (2007); Gkiasta (2008); Harris and Holmes (2008); Hutton (2005); Wallace (2010). The ways in which authors have combined historical and archaeological resources display not just variety of choices (about resources and about subject matter), but different ideas about what kinds of observa- tions are relevant. Since we live in environments that have very long human histories, the juxtaposition of old and new does not often strike us as particularly remarkable. The past is a resource; it is there to be used. Sometimes we choose to acknowledge the presence of the past, by selecting features to conserve and display using conservation techniques to consolidate the chosen features; at other times the past is concealed, walled off or filled with concrete or hollowed out. Edinburgh Castle stands on a prominent rock above the city, much like the Acropolis in Athens. (The unfinished facsimile of the Parthenon is on Calton Hill, not on the Castle Mound.) The contrast between the uses of the past at these two locations could not be greater. The one is still in many ways a fortress, with a barracks and military music school and museum. The other is simply a museum, shorn of any contamination from the past 500 years. Readers unfamiliar with AG , or those who have not studied much of its specialist content in recent decades, may be dimly aware of the overall changes that have taken place in the practice of Greek archaeology. It is worth enlarging on the substance of these changes; on the ways that they alter the kind of evidence at the disposal of scholars; and how this new configuration is likely to affect future research in and on ancient Greece. For much of the last century, the investigation of complex sites has been concerned with establishing the origins of various constructions, their architectural character and their chronology. Such formal concerns have largely been replaced by more holistic and diachronic strategies, and by technologies that allow a broader appreciation of landscapes as well as dynamic processes. In this issue of AG, the clearest illustration of such strategies is in the Peloponnese, where a variety of innovative techniques has been applied at sites where archaeological investigations already have a long tradition. These include Olympia, Nemea and Sparta, where remote sensing has produced datasets that include a variety of spatial and diachronic information, a resource that can be drawn on for many years to come. In his summary of recent trends in the Peloponnese, Daniel Stewart refers to the ways in which current work provides 'more organic readings of urban plans'. This applies partly to urban street networks that do not necessarily follow a rigid conception and may well depart in various ways from the kinds of assumptions that we make about how space was used within the urban layout ( cf Donati [2010]). It also applies to a greater appreciation of the 3D value of particular forms, which necessarily attracted other structures and monuments, in much the same way that features tend to congregate in contemporary town plans. These more open-ended approaches to the investi- gation of landscape have evolved from academic research, but the evidence that rescue work reveals shows some interesting parallels with planned research aims. The most dramatic examples in this issue of AG result from the works carried out prior to the Athens Olympics of 2004, which have now been published in preliminary form. The site of the New Olympic Hippodrome at Merenda (the location of the ancient deme of Myrrinous) has revealed a hitherto unknown settlement on a small hilltop dating from the mid fifth millennium BC, as well as a number of possible cult buildings, of different periods between the Early Iron Age and the Roman Empire, and at least five different cemetery nuclei, again with material dateable between the Late Bronze Age (with earlier activity of uncertain function), the Archaic and the Classical periods. Associated with these concentrations of human investment are roads and trackways, which are now coming into prominence in many parts of the Aegean. The Olympic Rowing Facility also produced prehistoric remains, this time of EHII date, a farm complex comprising at least 16 rooms, of Classical date, and two kilns used for tiles and perhaps pithoi. Development work in advance of the Athens metro extension (Line 3) has revealed sections of the Sacred Way, wayside shrines and cemeteries, as well as workshops and wells connected with groundwater from the Eridanos river. Other rescue work in and around the city has produced more evidence of the radiating road network (see Athens and Attica). Besides the more varied physical forms that have come to light, there are other aspects of the notion of place that deserve consideration. One concerns the connections that societies make between the physical and metaphysical worlds. We might begin by considering the Late Neolithic site at Kleitos, in Macedonia, where a number of constructions, which were originally decorated with geometric patterns, were apparently deliberately fired (see Macedonia and Thrace). This seems to have been an act designed to put the structure out of use, but also a kind of finality that transformed or transmuted the building into something else. The same kinds of proce- dures may have taken place at Avgi in Macedonia and have also been identified at Koutroulou Magoula, Thessaly. Bill Cavanagh suggests that these practices may be connected with the transmission of property rights. We are certainly faced with phenomena that</page><page sequence="18">18 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD imprint abstract concepts on the physical environment in a very deliberate way. At the same time, these acts imply attitudes to physical property that are profoundly different from more recent ones. The recent attacks on property in England during the second week of August 2011, including the destruction of real estate by burning, reminded us that the destruction of buildings is among the most socially reprehensible acts in modern societies. It touches on deeply held views about the social as well as the economic value of the built environment. To destroy property seems an illogical and retrograde gesture. In the Neolithic societies of the Balkans, the burning of buildings had a different meaning, perhaps connected with the periodicity of new construction. Recent events are a salutary reminder that societies do not have homogeneous attitudes to the built environment. A new study of the varying religious responses to ancient monuments in early modern England provides the sort of canvas that contributes to such considerations of place (Walsham [2011]). We can extend the abstract signification of place still further. John Bennet refers, in his survey of Crete, to the gold sheets or lamellae that have recently been published by Yannis Tzifopoulos. These items were discovered in burials at Eleutherna and Sfakaki, near Rethymnon and provide a wider contextual basis for understanding this particular mortuary phenomenon (Tzifopoulos [2010]; see Macedonia and Thrace for further discussion of some of the Macedonian burials). In a separate account, Tzifopoulos looks at a range of similar items from recently excavated sites in Macedonia as well as Crete (Tzifopoulos [2011]). His analysis provides a very welcome examination of artefacts in situations where we can begin to make sense of the concepts underlying mortuary procedures. This paper is published alongside a number of others that look at the writings associated with 'Orphic' beliefs, so that readers can assess descriptions of the 'Orphic' afterlife (which refer to landscapes that the deceased can identify) with the manner in which 'Orphic' burials were made. The relationship between commu- nities that curated the kinds of writings examined here and the burials identified as having 'Orphic' associations deserves to be reconsidered in the light of these latest discoveries.

There are three separate themes which have suggested themselves somewhat fortuitously, but give a feel for current trends in research: (a) integrated interdisci- plinary applications of archaeological science; (b) the movement of people by sea as well as by land and the human exchanges mediated through such movements; and (c) settlement history and the organization of space within settlements. There will be a particular emphasis on the Peloponnese and southern Greece, though the net is spread wider for the earlier periods. Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Reports of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic finds from Greece continue slowly to accrue (for an overview of sites, see Sampson [2006]). Recent work has looked to Crete; surface finds from Gavdos (a small island to the south of Crete; Kopaka and Matzanas [2009]) and sites on the cliffs and caves on the shore-line close to Plakias have raised interesting new perspectives. Finds of Acheulean handaxes, chopping tools, cleavers and scrapers seem to indicate that the earliest human activity probably reaches back to the Lower Palaeolithic, as well as producing important assemblages of tools which typologically seem to belong to the Middle Palaeolithic (Fig. 17). The finds seem to link in with those from the southern Peloponnese, notably the group of cave sites known from southern Lakonia (Apidima, Kalamakia, Schoini 3 and 4, Lakonis, Anavalos and Elaea; see Efstathiou-Manolakou [2009] 7; Panagopoulou et al [2002-2004] with further references). In northern Greece, Middle and Late Palaeolithic finds continue to be reported (Kastoria, Rachona). Although much further research and full publication is required to confirm, in particular, the chronology of these finds, they indicate that, contrary to received opinion, early man was able to make sea-crossings and exploited such crossings in the early movements into Europe from Africa. Franchthi is a rich source of data whose study is on- going. To continue the maritime theme, recent reports have emphasized the results of faunal analysis: basic trends in foraging from the Upper Palaeolithic into the Mesolithic start with a focus on terrestrial fauna in the lower half of the sequence, shifting to mixed marine- terrestrial sources with marked 'instability' in economic and other faunal patterns, some of which must relate to dramatic climate shifts leading into the Holocene. When foragers started to turn to aquatic resources in earnest, they began by gathering pond turtles and marine shellfish. Marine fishing was also practised early on, but fishing became more important and diversified with time, beginning with easily collected small animals, moving to greater use of fish and ultimately to fishing for tuna, large fish that are difficult to catch and land. By the later part of the Mesolithic fish had become very important, culmi- nating in a heavy emphasis on tuna fishing. Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic finds have also recently been reported from Attica in the cave at Keratsini, Aigaleo. 17. Plakias Survey: Palaeolithic artefacts from Preveli site 7. © ASCSA. Neolithic Early Neolithic finds confirm the establishment already in the seventh millennium BC of what were to become significant tell sites (Knossos Kephala, Dikili Tash, Paliambela Kolindrou; note also the infant burial at Paliambela Roditi) as well as shorter lived Early Neolithic settlements (Merenda, Ano Balana, Reggini). Considerable debate still surrounds the nature and origins of these earliest Neolithic communities, as the recent review of the Early and Middle Neolithic finds from Argissa has underlined (Reingruber [2008]). We still do not have a clear picture of how much these communities owed to an influx of people from the Near East and how far a local Mesolithic population participated. The discovery of Mesolithic finds from the Plakias and Gavdos surveys indicate that Crete was not uninhabited at the time. The Middle Neolithic ( ca . 5800-5300 BC) in Greece (as through much of central Europe - compare the broadly contemporary Linear Pottery cultures, north of the Balkans) represents a high-point in the development of village communal life. At Koutroulou rectangular struc- tures (5.3 x 4.3 and 7.2 x 6.4m; see also Kastoria Avgi) show evidence of phases of the destruction, renewal and reconstruction of houses on the same spot, perhaps to be linked in with ancestral succession and the transmission of property rights from one generation to another (Fig. 18). At Kouphovouno there is also evidence for the deliberate destruction of buildings by fire, as has been reported from sites throughout the Balkans. As throughout southern Greece, the greatest part of the Middle Neolithic assem- blage is dominated by monochrome, scribble-burnished or patterned Urfirnis pottery, evidently made for display and frequently used for open shapes, for the consumption of food, though collar-necked jars point to storage too. Special cooking pots were made in a coarse fabric and there may have been some other kitchen-ware types (Fig. 19). This emphasis on pottery being used for display stands in marked contrast with the ensuing Late Neolithic, which,</page><page sequence="20">20 BILL CAVANAGH 18. Koutroulou Magoula: Building 2, showing the northern and eastern walls and part of the interior. © BSA (Koutroulou Magoula project). 19. Kouphovouno: Middle Neolithic cooking pot. © BSA. over a transitional phase, sees an ever greater proportion of undecorated, coarse, closed vessels, used for food processing and storage, side by side with the tablewares (Black Ware, Grey Ware, Matt Painted and Polychrome). These changes in the ceramic repertory convey changes in the way food was consumed, processed and stored. The cultural transformation is also marked by the abandonment of the practice of deliberate destruction by fire - the Late Neolithic archaeological sediments at Kouphovouno differ markedly from those of the Middle Neolithic. The immense span of time represented by the Late and Final Neolithic periods still presents many problems of interpretation. The Late and Final Neolithic, which may have lasted some 2,000 years, continues to feature in finds from surveys (Antikythera, Kythera, Saronic Gulf [SHARP survey], East Korinthia Archaeological Survey, Sikyon Survey, Andritsa Goulas, Helos Plain, Ancient Cities of Boeotia, Eastern Boeotia Archaeological Project, Karystos, Pelion Cave Project) as well as excavated sites (Aigeira, Midea, Mount Lykaion, Geraki, Halai, Pavlopetri, Kouphovouno, Kokkala, Nea Erythraia, Pani Hill, Koropi, Boriza, Tsepi cemetery). Cave sites were also intensively exploited at the time (Alepochori, Sarakinos, Leondari cave, Keratsini, Aigaleo, Skortsinos Troupitses cave; note also those recorded by Efstathiou-Manolakou [2009] in Lakonia: Schoini, Alepotrypa, Kataphygi, Xepapadianika, Vythakas, Melissa, Lykouras, Vri, Pavle, Ag. Anargyroi, Apsiphi, Trypalia, Ag. Aikaterini, Mavri Spilia, Papa Giannakou, Igoumenou). On the face of it, the finds would appear to imply an expansion of population, but in fact the settlements, especially those located through surface survey, are often very small farmsteads and were relatively short-lived. Rather than a simple expansion of population we seem to see the conse- quences of a change in the basic economy, which gave greater emphasis to the exploitation of secondary land, rather than exclusively the primary arable which supported the large stable villages of the sixth millennium BC. Bioarchaeological analysis (a combination of skeletal and isotopic studies) suggests a relatively poor diet (Papathanasiou [2001]; Lagia et al [2007]) and poor health among these Late Neolithic populations; carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses indicate that the diet was primarily based on cereals with some animal protein. All the same, the range of domesticates expanded: thus recent finds from Dikili Tash have served to confirm the practice of viticulture as early as the fifth millennium BC (Valamoti et al [2007]; Fig. 20). Early Bronze Age Until recently not many Early Bronze Age cemeteries were known on the mainland of Greece, but the count is now increasing with cemeteries of collective tombs (either rock-cut or stone built) reported from Kalamaki Elaiochori in Achaia (Vasilogamvrou 1996-1997; 2000; 2008), Delpriza in the Argolid (Fig. 21; cf Fig. 22) and ancient Elis (as well as Pavlopetri). Dating back to EHI, they confirm a degree of cultural unity across southern and central Greece at this time, as well as exchanges with the Cyclades. 20.

The publication of Early Bronze Age Lerna has provided a much firmer framework for the chronology of the classic EHII period. The excavations at Geraki have confirmed that features which mark the zenith of EHII in the Argolid belong to the later part of that period in Lakonia too - fortifications and storage of agricultural commodities under seal. Very recent surveys by members of the 5th EPCA, announced at the conference Early Helladic Laconia held at the Netherlands Institute in January 2010, have confirmed the dense pattern of occupation during this period, including the location of a number of fortified sites. An Early Bronze Age sealing, of the type known from Lerna, Petri and Geraki, was also found at the coastal site of Boza. Sealings, as well as indications of sophisticated architecture, have been recovered from the west part of the Lower Town at Tiryns, a good distance from the Rundbau on the acropolis of the site. Note also the discovery of an Early Bronze Age seal from the islet of Modi, near Poros. EHII fortified sites have also been reported in coastal locations on Salamis at Ormos Kolones and Lykopoulou. Middle Bronze Age The publication in 2010 of the proceedings of the major 2006 Mesohelladika conference (Philippa-Touchais et al.) has opened the way for a significant reappraisal of the period. It is impossible, in a short review, to cover all the insights provided by this magnificent volume, but in what follows I shall look to the themes of archaeological science, settlement and domestic space, and the maritime link. Aegean archaeology is still in the midst of a shake-up of absolute dating, where the conventional (low) chronology, based on links with Egyptian dates, has been challenged by new scientific techniques combining high precision radiocarbon dates with Bayesian statistical techniques, which allow the incorporation of information such as phasing and stratigraphy to provide better dates. The new high chronology has shortened the span of the Middle Bronze Age to 300-400 years, putting the MHIII-LHI boundary at ca. 1700 BC, and extends the span of LHI-II from two to almost three centuries. Fresh dates from Lerna support the high chronology. Bioarchaeological data for the Middle Bronze Age have been studied from the site of Kolonna, on the island of Aegina, which seems to have outstripped mainland Middle Bronze Age centres with its remarkable rich warrior burial, anticipating the shaft grave burials at Mycenae, and with the Large Building complex, a monumental structure dominating the town's centre, which was founded in MHII and continued through three major architectural phases into LHI. The remarkable Aegina treasure in the British Museum also seems to date to the same period as the Large Building. The animal bones associated with this structure, whilst confirming the standard range of domesticated mammals, witnessed rarer wild species such as fallow and roe deer, possibly wild boar (recall the boar's tusk helmet in the warrior grave), aurochs and even lion - evidently hunting trophies to be linked with an elite lifestyle. Analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) has also been applied to Middle Bronze Age skeletons from Greece (Bouwman et al [2009]). Researchers emphasize that, as temperature is the main determinant of the breakdown of DNA, in normal circumstances in Greece the Middle Bronze Age is close to the chronological limit for aDNA to survive successfully. Kouphovouno has produced some reliable results, not least thanks to carefully controlled sampling of recently excavated skeletons. Both mitochondrial and genomic aDNA was recovered, some samples (32% and 23% respectively) providing strong, repeated signals, others weak signals and some no signals at all. Whilst there are some immediate gains (for example, it is possible to sex the skeletons of children, which is not possible on the basis of skeletal morphology; see the recent result from Kolonna), the technique opens great future potential to explore genetic relationships and genetic disorders (such as thalassaemia). If the evidence of maritime archaeology has under- lined the importance of movement throughout the Aegean, Strontium isotope analysis is now coming into application to document the movement of individuals from one community to another - as illustrated by Nafplioti's initial analysis of skeletal remains from the shaft graves at Mycenae (Nafplioti [2008]). The importance of 'faction' or 'family' leaders and the significance of factional alliance has been emphasized by Dickinson (2010) in his opening paper to the Mesohelladika conference; the combination of scientific analysis and archaeological observation is beginning to document these relationships. The longer research history in ceramic analysis has established a large database of results and an ever more sophisticated framework of analysis. The work on the ceramics from Kolonna (Fig. 23) has now borne fruit with the publication of a major study by Gauss and Kiriatzi (2011). Here the research has involved close collaboration</page><page sequence="22">22 BILL CAVANAGH 23. Aegina, Kolonna: Minoanising wheelmade jug from the Large Building. © Osterreichisches Archaologisches Institut. between archaeological ceramicist (Gauss) and archaeo- logical scientist (Kiriatzi). Forty two different macro- scopic groups of locally produced and imported pottery have been defined, many of them confirmed by scientific analysis. The degree of overlap between the fabrics defined through macroscopic inspection and those defined in terms of chemical and petrographic analysis is very high. Similar success has been achieved working on the pottery recovered from the surveys of Kythera and Antikythera (Pentedeka et al. [2010]), throwing light on the exchanges between the southern Peloponnese and Crete, especially critical during the Middle Bronze Age and early Late Bronze Age, as well as helping to refine the dating and interpretation of often difficult finds from surface survey. In terms of settlement pattern the conference has brought much new evidence together underlining a distinctive privileging of acropoleis, the expression in the landscape of an ideology of hierarchy which was to reach its apogee in the palaces of the high Mycenaean period. Furthermore, space within these acropoleis was increas- ingly differentiated between leaders and the rest of the population. Finally, the histories of these sites vary considerably from one to another; some show continuity from the Early Bronze Age and sometimes on into historic times, many seem to be new/refoundations at one stage or another of the Middle Bronze Age, and some, but by no means all, continue to flourish under the Mycenaean palaces (Peloponnese: Zavadil [2010]; Attica: Papadimitriou [2010]). Although some sites show conti- nuity through EHIII, it is increasingly clear that this new settlement pattern was established in the Middle Bronze Age. The chequered histories of one centre or another no doubt mirror the dynastic histories of those who dominated the towns. Focused study of the architecture and finds from the Middle Helladic settlement on the Aspis hill at Argos has yielded a much clearer picture of the site's development. Already in the early Middle Bronze Age the presence of pithoi underline the importance of storage, one of the hints that the characterization of the Middle Helladic period as primitive can be overstated. In MHIII, contemporary with the shaft graves at Mycenae, the reorganization of space within the site, articulated through a series of concentric terraces, shows some distinction between the summit, with buildings of some pretension and a pottery assemblage indicating feasting, and the lower town (Fig. 24). 24. Argos, Aspis: west wall of House N. © EfA. The Middle Helladic cemeteries found on the nearby Argos Hospital site were evidently extra-mural, lining the road and arranged in clusters, though eventually late Middle Helladic/early Late Helladic houses impinged on the graves. Megali Magoula, Galatas, on the Saronic Gulf, also had a distinct inner acropolis (O.lha), defended by a strong wall and enclosing a prosperous settlement (Fig. 25). Perhaps just going back into EHIII, the bulk of the pottery dates to the Middle Helladic. Presumably those dominating the site were responsible for building the three tholos tombs (Tomb 3 MHIII/LHI; Tombs 1 and 2 LHIIB-IIIB). The Mycenaean settlement centre, however, seems to have moved elsewhere. The Midea acropolis, continuously occupied from the end of the Neolithic period, expanded notably in the Middle Bronze Age to cover the entire area later to be</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 23 enclosed by the Mycenaean walls. The remains are poorly preserved, with some graves found within the town, including a rich LHI child burial, though scattered graves lower down the hill point to extra-mural burial as well. Cisterns were constructed to secure the water supply in late Middle Helladic/early Late Helladic. The pottery points to widespread exchanges across the Aegean and with Minoan Crete. Geraki, on the other hand, like much of the southern Peloponnese, has a break at the end of the Early Bronze Age, but is reoccupied in the Middle Helladic, a pattern also observable at Ag. Stephanos (Taylour and Janko [2008]) and the Menelaion site (Catling [2009]). The scatter of more elaborate and prosperous graves from these sites and elsewhere in the southern Peloponnese (Sparta Psychiko, Vasara, Ag. Vasileios, Kastroulia Ampheias, Pyrgaki-Tsouka) indicate both that some measure of social differentiation was already expressed in burials of MHI date and that the need to emphasize both ancestry and status was felt very widely in Middle Bronze Age towns and villages throughout Greece. Pagona, near Patras, seems to have been a new foundation in MHIIIA, and covered 1.5ha over the summit and west slopes of the hill; a destruction level across the site has been dated to LHIIB/IIIA1. On the other hand, Aigion shows a period of abandonment after a confla- 25.

A large, rectangular structure built in LHI has been compared with similar and roughly contemporary buildings from Tsoungiza, Kirrha, Thermos and Drakotrypa; the site was replanned in LHIIB/IIIA1. Aigeira, further down the coast, reveals evidence for a short and probably isolated period of occupation of late Early Helladic or early Middle Helladic date. Salamis also has prominent Middle Helladic acropolis sites, notably at Kanakia, which was to become the Mycenaean centre, and at Sklavos, whilst a review of the Middle Helladic finds from Athens Makrigianni has suggested that there were small clusters of houses spread across a large area (from the Ilissos in the south to the Eridanos in the north) around the Acropolis. This rather open, dispersed pattern of occupation has been noted at other Middle Helladic sites. Attica is marked by a scatter of (probably) fortified sites (Kiapha Thiti, Brauron, Christos, Plasi, Ag. Nikolas, Thorikos). In the area of Nafpaktos a number of new Middle Helladic sites have been excavated (Chania Gavrolimnis, Perithori, Kato Mamoulada) which were new founda- tions in MHII-III, whilst at Dimini, in Thessaly, the site was reoccupied in MHIII, after a long period of almost complete abandonment (EHIII-MHII). Its progress towards becoming a significant Mycenaean centre is marked by the graves, notably the tholos tombs excavated in the 19th century, though the importance of storage (for example, the five pithoi in one room of House I) points to the agricultural wealth of those interred in the graves. Classic Middle Helladic pottery and apsidal houses have been found in the west Thessalian plain (Kastro Karditsas, Agiokeraso, Karya, Ermitsi) and Lamia Kastro. An unusual discovery of MHI date is what appears to be part of the hull of a small boat preserved as an impression and dark stain in clay at the site of Mitrou. Late Bronze Age Recent excavation of Mycenaean settlements has added greatly to our understanding of the relationship between the primary palatial centres and secondary sites. These raise important issues concerning the rise of the Mycenaean states, and the history and nature of political control in Bronze Age Greece. The excavations at Ag. Vasileios in Lakonia must take pride of place. Although the probable importance of this site had been suspected by earlier researchers, it was only confirmed with the discovery, under a watching brief, of fragments of Linear B tablets, one recording a transaction to do with over 500 daggers, two others connected with textiles. The excavations have now revealed an early Mycenaean building complex (A) (Fig. 26), one of whose rooms held a hoard of weapons (16 bronze swords, a dagger, a knife, spearheads, a bronze helmet and the remains of a boar's tusk helmet). Building B has produced fragments of wall-paintings showing male and female figures as well as the wheel of a chariot. The nearby chamber tombs have been dated to LHI/II-IIIA1 (Fig. 27). Perhaps fairly representative of a provincial Mycenaean town is the site of Lazarides on the east side of the island of Aegina. First known from its cemetery, the settlement lies to the southeast. It was occupied in the Middle Bronze Age and throughout the Mycenaean period</page><page sequence="24">24 BILL CAVANAGH 26. Ag. Vasileios: Building A. © Archaeological Society of Athens. 27. Ag. Vasileios: MHIII-LHI graves. © Archaeological Society of Athens. to LHIIIC Early. In spite of its inland setting, there are indications of small-scale industrial activity and widespread contacts: lead originally from Lavrion, a lead weight with parallels from Cyprus and some early iron artefacts. In the Middle Bronze Age such contacts would certainly have been mediated through the important port of Kolonna, but that site's history of occupation in the main Mycenaean periods is less clear. A new discovery is the LHIIIB harbour town of Korphos-Kalamianos, which was 7.2ha in extent and defended by a fortification wall. Some 4ha were built over, organized into insulae separated by narrow streets, but the remainder was left open (Fig. 28). What appears to be a subsidiary, related site was located on a hilltop at Akrotiri Stiri. Different in scale and function but similar in date and ambition to Gla, the surveyors suggest that Mycenae used the port to help exert its control over the Saronic Gulf. Further south, off the coast at Modi, excavation has started on a LHIIIC shipwreck. The combination of surface collection, geophysical survey and excavation has become almost a standard methodology allowing broad generalization about the extent, history and nature of occupation to be combined with the precision offered by excavation. Thus the site of Kakovatos, whose rich (but partially robbed) and magnificent LHIIA tholos tombs were excavated by Dorpfeld in 1907-1908, has now been surveyed and is in course of excavation. The site's foundation goes back to the Middle Bronze Age and occupation continues through to LHIIIA, but not, evidently, into LHIIIB. Was this important centre, whose acropolis was crowned by a monumental tower, quashed in the later Mycenaean period by the rise of a rival palace elsewhere in the northwest Peloponnese - rather in the way suggested for the somewhat similar site at Peristeria, ultimately consigned to obscurity by the rise of a rival, the palace at Pylos? In central Greece, the islet of Mitrou seems to have a similar story to tell. The site, over 6ha in extent and with a fairly continuous history of occupation from the Neolithic through the Early and Middle Bronze Age, has produced extensive remains of the early Mycenaean period, including Building D, large but with thin walls and mainly beaten-earth floors. The building was abandoned and at its centre was constructed a chamber tomb, built of mud- brick walls lined with large, cut, sandstone slabs and accessed through a dromos. The tomb was in use from LHI-IIIA. (This recalls the construction of a massive cist grave in the floor of a Middle Helladic megaron at Plasi, Marathon.) At the start of the palatial period (LHIIIA2) there was a major destruction across the site followed by a period of much diminished activity in LHIIIA2-B, then some revival in Postpalatial times. If some sites were brought low through the expansion of the palatial states, their power to mobilize labour on a monumental scale is also stamped on the landscape of Greece. The great walls at Gla did not enclose a 'natural' town and the site has no history of earlier Bronze Age occupation. It was a new foundation (evidently by Orchomenos) as part of a massive project of landscape engineering to exploit the Copais basin. A campaign of geophysical survey over some 35ha close to the site has revealed two networks of agricultural exploitation, one for drained land and the other exploiting irrigation. On the interior of the site, survey has revealed structures in the area previously thought to be empty of buildings as well as new details of the fortifications. The ambition and scale of these works bears eloquent testimony to those who commanded them. In the Argolid much new work has continued at the major sites of Mycenae, Hryns (Fig. 29), Midea and Argos. It is impossible, in a brief overview of this kind, to do justice to this fundamental work. 28. Kalamianos: building remains. © ASCSA.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 25 29. Tiryns, west staircase: fresco fragments with at least seven human figures, probably depicting an initiation rite. © DAI. Important innovations in the technology of recording and survey have been developed at the Bronze Age site of Pavlopetri (Fig. 30). Part of the rationale of this project was to test innovatory survey technologies for the 3D digital recording of underwater remains, and their successful application will open the way for much faster recording of this important part of Greece's archaeo- logical heritage. The site probably extended over some 8ha; to the 3ha originally surveyed in 1968 new areas have been revealed covering a further 1.4ha. The street plan and detailed building plans have revealed the anatomy of this major Bronze Age port. Selective collection of pottery has revealed that its occupation goes back to the Final Neolithic period. Significant Minoan finds confirm the close links with Crete, probably to be associated with Minoan Kythera, nearby, whose floruit during the Middle and beginning of the Late Bronze Age has been documented through the Kythera Island Project. Mygdalia, in Achaia, is a naturally defensible, hilltop site; although small in extent (0.65ha), it boasts a small Mycenaean tholos tomb. It flourished in the early Mycenaean period and into LHIIIC. In the history of Bronze Age Athens an unexplained gap in the funerary record over the LHIIIB period has proved something of a puzzle. The report of chamber tombs from excavations at Monastiraki Areos 2-4 does something to fill the gap. The renewed activity at Thorikos has brought once more to the fore this important site in Attica. Papadimitriou (2010) has underlined the mixed fortunes of this gateway to the mineral wealth of Attica; evidently flourishing in the early Mycenaean period, it seems to fade after LHIIIA. The LHIIIB large, multi-roomed complex at Kanakia on Salamis evidently served as the centre of the Mycenaean polity on the island. Archaeological evidence suggesting continuous cult practice from Mycenaean into later Greek times has been relatively thin. However, recent finds by the Altar to Zeus on Mount Lykaion include prehistoric material (Early Helladic, Middle Helladic and Late Helladic pottery, a LMII rock-crystal lentoid seal). And the renewed excava- tions in the sanctuary at Kalapodi have yielded pottery and figurines dating back now to LHIIIA, that is to say the full palatial period, and finds also include a Middle Minoan seal, which could suggest that the sanctuary dates back to the Middle Bronze Age. Perhaps more typical of the history of Mycenaean shrines is the site of Ag. Konstantinos, Methana, which attracted worship during LHIII, but was abandoned in LHIIIC. 30.

In the northern Aegean, at ancient Hephaistia, Lemnos, the Italian School explored a colon- naded peristyle house whose total dimensions are not yet stated. If within a still coherent urban site, it belongs to a well-documented feature of towns in Late Roman Greece. Otherwise it belongs in the equally interesting suburban or rural category. Coins in the destruction layer include a follis of Heraclius of 610-611. The second decade of the seventh century witnessed violent destructions at urban and rural sites all over northern Greece (the mainland and islands, for example Thasos), whose causes are much debated. In Macedonia (nomos of Kozani), at Ag. Menas, Velvendos, the 17th EBA explored a well-appointed baths complex (Fig. 31) attributed to a suburban villa whose full context is not yet known. There is an associated coin of Justinian (527-562). However, one should also consider the possibility that this complex belonged to an ecclesiastical establishment. 31. Ag. Menas, Velvendos, Macedonia: hypocausts and remains of marble paving in baths attached to the church. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 17th EBA. The 17th EBA previously reported an Early Byzantine church associated with baths at Larissa, Phrourio (Fig. 32). This association is normal at pilgrimage centres. Five hundred metres northwest of Ag. Menas, the 17th EBA explored in 2007 a larger baths complex (Fig. 33), in the decoration of which capitals of three dates in the Late Antique era were used (fourth- and fifth-century and of ca. AD 500). This is interpreted by the excavator, M. Tsiapali, as a public baths complex. But again, one should ask to what extent any provincial civitas (as opposed to the Church) was building such facilities by AD 500. At Molos, 2km outside ancient Abdera, the 19th EPCA explored from 2004 onwards an elite residence with triclinium of the fourth to fifth century. Outside Edessa, the 17th EPCA explored in 2007 part of a complex combining an agricultural storeroom for no less than 30 pithoi associated with third-, fourth- and fifth-century finds (ID480), a discovery which suggests the centre of an agricultural estate (whether or not an elite residence is attached; there is accumulating evidence of such basic granges). All these discoveries enrich an emerging archae- ology of the lay and religious elite's presence in, and management of, the rural economy. 32.

Rarely explored, but of great significance for any understanding of the Late Roman settlement patterns of mainland Greece (arguably with the exception of the Peloponnese), are rural fortifications of various origins. The 7th EBA explored in 2008-2009 the fortress of Velika, in the vicinity of ancient Meliboia, Thessaly (Fig. 34). The site overlooks an important north-south route through eastern Thessaly and partly reconditions an ancient fortifi- cation. It is powerfully constructed in a lime-mortar bonded masonry. It contains a church (whose dimensions seem not yet established) and has yielded sixth- to seventh-century pottery. It thus has all the characteristics of a type of Late Roman site found throughout the Balkan peninsula. Interestingly, a similar complex at Kastri Livadiou, near Doliche in Thessaly, was previously reported by the 7th EBA.</page><page sequence="28">28 ARCHIE DUNN 34. Velika, near ancient Meliboia: re-use of Hellenistic walls in Byzantine fortress. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 7th EBA. Different but complementary aspects of the Late Roman cities of Greece continue to be revealed by surveys and excavations, demonstrating the value of both methods. The intensive survey by the Dutch-Slovenian Eastern Boeotia Archaeological Project (EBAP) plotted the shrinkage of the settled area of Koroneia in Late Antiquity, and the same mission explored, in the extra- mural area of ancient and Late Roman Thespiai, part of a clearly large Early Byzantine basilica at Makri Ekklesia, Thespies. Those familiar with the earlier Boeotian Survey will know that Late Roman/Early Byzantine Thespiai was focused upon a small spolia-built fort. This large basilica was built outside the now-invisible fort in its suburbium. On the site of ancient and Late Roman Sparta (or perhaps of Late Roman Sparta's suburbium' ?) the 5th EBA reported the discovery on Alcman and Lysander Street of an olive press 'in proximity' to an Early Byzantine basilica, a juxta- position which is extremely interesting for the total archae- ology of ecclesiastical complexes: a fast-developing story. The Ephoreia has also found (2006-2009) monumental structures which may have Late Roman and Middle Byzantine phases on the site of ancient Sparta (but, implicitly outside the Late Roman defences; see ID 1903, 1904, 1905; see also ID1906, Sparta acropolis basilica). The Late Roman city as an object of imperial concern and investment is well illustrated by new discoveries behind the waterfront of Thessaloniki, where two distinct phases of its seawall have been identified by the 16th EPCA during the renovation of the Stoa Hirsch on Tsimiski Street between 2008 and 2010: a mid third-century phase that is 2.5m thick, and a subsequent, still Late Roman, phase that is ca. 3.5m thick. Both the third- and fourth- to fifth- century phases of the land walls have long been recognized and were recently analysed by Professor Velenis. The third-century phase would have been part of the complex set of responses to the Gothic invasion of 238. The rescue archaeology of Thessaloniki (Late Roman provincial capital, occasional imperial residence and usually from the late fourth century onwards residence of the Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum) continues to generate excellent case-studies of the Late Roman use of urban spaces: a glassmaker's workshop (fifth- to seventh-century; Figs. 35, 36); a high-status Late Roman townhouse with triclinium (of which many have been recorded there in some detail in recent decades); a secular public building of the fifth century which is more than 53 x 31m. The long-term characteristics of the transformation in the uses of the public or at least monumental buildings of Graeco-Roman cities is well documented by the Italian School's excavations at Gortyn (capital of the province of Roman and Late Roman Crete), where the excavations of the Theatre of the Pythion (beside the Temple of Apollo) reveal that the approaches to the stage were already the site of stables before the theatre's destruction in the great earthquake of AD 365. The archaeology of the principal new monuments of Late Roman cities - churches and their ancillary buildings - is often also a documentation of the transformation of civic spaces, of the public and private aspects of Christianization and many linked cultural processes. The University of Athens' excavations at Palaiopolis, Andros (site of the ancient city of Andros) continued in 2009 to explore the construction, upon the lower terrace of the city's agora, of an Early Byzantine basilica (Fig. 37). The floor mosaic includes an elite donor's inscription (a not uncommon feature of the floors of these churches). Excavations by the 16th EPCA in 2010 explored an Early Byzantine cemetery basilica just outside the eastern walls of Thessaloniki (Plateia Syntrivaniou). As excavations have made plain, monumental churches were not rapidly built within cities' walls (except by imperial intervention) after the Edict of Toleration, so this church (as opposed to 'house churches') may have been as close as the Christian 35.

Is the basilica of ca. AD 500 recorded by the 5th EBA on the property of A. Biba and St. Spyridakou in 2007 within the Late Roman enceinte or not? In a very real sense the presence, extra-mural or intra-mural, and other characteristics of Early Byzantine churches provide yardsticks by which to evaluate the post-Roman trajectories of urban centres. So the discovery of structures that are clearly two large Early Byzantine basilicas with donor's inscriptions at Nafpaktos (Noti Botsari Street) and at Kryoneri by the 8th EBA is of great interest. Both research and rescue archaeology continue to enrich our knowledge of another type of site which, like rural fortresses and rural ecclesiastical complexes, begin</page><page sequence="30">30 ARCHIE DUNN to characterize parts of Late Roman Greece, that is the locus of maritime traffic. At Livadi on Schoinoussa, the 2nd EBA has since 2007 explored dwellings and harbourside installations (unspecified) of the Early Byzantine period. And at Leukos, Karpathos the Canadian Institute's Synergasia with the 4th EBA has held its second season of excavation and survey of an extensive, densely settled Early Byzantine harbourside settlement, which includes a large basilica of the fifth to sixth century and the kilns that produced the site's Late Roman common wares. Meanwhile, other Late Roman kiln sites for common or coarsewares continued to be explored at the maritime site of ancient Halasarna (modern Kardamaina, Kos) by the 2nd EBA and the University of Athens, and at two sites in eastern Boeotia near to the Euboean Gulf (Dilesi and Mandri Danou, Tanagra) by the 9th EPCA and the 23rd EBA (ID2007). The transitional period of the seventh to eighth or ninth century is still proving hard to identify, particularly in the lesser centres of 'historically' continuous habitation. But recent discoveries at both major and lesser sites seem to be extremely useful. At Gortyn, the Italian School has paid particular attention to the Late Roman and transi- tional Byzantine levels over the last 30 years, making it a crucial site for Byzantine archaeology in general. Here there is evidence (or rather good further evidence) of sequences of non-monumental made street surfaces (which are themselves proof of organization and are of a type identified in the area of the New Acropolis Museum in Athens too), as well as of a two-storeyed building containing amphorae of the seventh and eighth centuries. The Italian School has demonstrated that the community reorganized its water supply in the seventh century and survived two devastating earthquakes, one in the early seventh century, the other sometime before ca. 670. Also on Crete, at the site of Priniatikos Pyrgos, excavations in 2010 revealed that by its good natural harbour people used Constantinopolitan Glazed White Wares (=GWW), which have a long history (Transitional and Middle Byzantine). It would be interesting to know to which of John Hayes' phases of GWW these belong. Exploration and recording of the Middle Byzantine phases of multi-period urban centres proceeds on a small scale: we note work at Monemvasia, at Larissa and at Palaia Episkopi, Tegea. In the centre of Thessaloniki the 9th EBA has excavated since 2009 a complex which is thought to contain the burial place of St Theodora of Thessaloniki, the city's major Medieval female saint. The systematic excavation of Middle Byzantine rural religious complexes is a comparatively recent devel- opment (as opposed to architectural studies and conser- vation projects). Professor Panagiotis Vokotopoulos' excavations of the 13th-century site at Philippiada in Epirus (conducted as part of an architectural and conser- vation project) were for many years almost unique. More recently the 10th EBA has excavated the 10th- to 12th- century Athonite monastery of Tou Zygou (Phrankokastro, Nea Ouranoupolis). In 2005-2006 the 7th EBA explored a rural Byzantine monastery at Koutsoupia, modern Meliboia, a probably 11th- to 13th-century complex containing an expensively decorated Katholikon, cells, winery and enclosing walls. At Psili Vrysi near Edessa, a Late Byzantine monastery (ID481) of the 13th to 14th century (i.e. relatively short-lived, but not necessarily rare in this respect) was explored by the 17th EPCA as a rescue project in 2007. It contained a Katholikon (used for burials), a kitchen, an apsidal refectory, a phiale and a tower. The exonarthex (a secondary phase of the church) has external frescoes. The productive installations of the Medieval Byzantine rural economy have rarely been studied. But at Kampos, Kastro Limenarion, Thasos, the 18th EPCA in 2007 explored parts of such a complex: six wine presses, built of lime-mortar bonded masonry, associated terrace walls and a watch-tower. The site is argued to be Late Byzantine and post-Byzantine. It is not reported whether the site has been historically identified, but Thasos was a location for estates of the monasteries of Mount Athos, Late Byzantine and post-Byzantine, and one of their consistent investments was in winemaking for the market. This excavation could be of great interest for the history of the Late Byzantine rural economy.</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 31 ATHENS AND ATTICA (PREHISTORIC TO ROMAN) Robert Pitt British School at Athens The publication in 2010 of an Archaiologikon Deltion volume serving up four years of archaeological reports for Athens and Attica (2001-2004) has provided much to digest both in terms of quantity of data and in the happy coincidence that these years contain some of the largest scale excavations in recent decades, ahead of the building of the New Acropolis Museum, a large series of works for new Metro stations in the city, the extension of the Attiki Odos and works related to several of the 2004 Olympic facilities. Asty and Piraeus Several newspapers in 2010 enthusiastically announced the removal of sections of scaffolding from the Acropolis skyline. The restoration of the Temple of Athena Nike was completed, the structure now back on its bastion being a full metre taller than previously. At the Propylaia, restoration of the ceiling of the east portico was completed by the addition of members of the entablature and the two last ceiling beams, enabling the visitor to see parts of the elaborate coffered ceiling from below. Restoration of the Parthenon's north side was finished, and the project now moves to the west side of the monument and the removal of metope blocks still in situ. The New Acropolis Museum celebrated its second birthday in June 2011, while work continued to consolidate and open up for display the excavations underneath the building, allowing visitors to look down from viewing platforms and through glass floors into this area rich in ancient habitation. The 2001-2004 seasons of excavations at this site are reported in ADe/f (see earlier reports in AR 52 [2005-2006] 8; AR 56 [2009-2010] 4-6). In the southwest section of the plot (the area of the demolished properties on Hatzichristou Street), discoveries included the western continuation of Road I and its junction with Road II, at which lies a new multi-phase building (House 0) founded towards the end of the fifth century BC, which contains a well-preserved andron with a mosaic floor of marble and pebbles in separated panels (Figs. 38, 39). The house remained in use over a long period and underwent many repairs and alterations. In the Hellenistic period, a 38.

Makrigianni: House 0. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 1st EPCA. workshop established in the courtyard was probably a fullery or washery. In the second century AD the house was extended towards the east. Its rooms were arranged around an interior courtyard with a floor of marble gravel. The final destruction came at the end of the third century AD. In the south and southeast sections of the plot, fragmentary remains were removed for the construction of the basements of the museum, including the surfaces of the ancient Road III, in use from the end of the fourth century BC until the end of the third century AD, while a section of the ancient Road I is dated to the end of the fifth century BC. Removal of the remains of the Roman House A enabled exploration of the preceding marble- worker's shop from the first century BC to the first century AD. This was primarily an outdoor establishment with a few sheltered areas to the south. Among the layers of chips and marble dust was a considerable number of fragments of half-worked sculptures and pottery (Fig. 40), as well as a large number of lead sheets, probably from tools. Further south was a pit for casting bronze statues, with the remains of a clay mould used for successive castings in situ (Fig. 41). Further excavation of the bedrock in this area revealed 20 ancient wells and nine cisterns of various periods. The continuing excavations of the Athenian Agora are illuminating much-neglected periods of the city's history. John Camp reports on the 2010 season. In Section BG, exploration continued of the Byzantine, Frankish and Ottoman levels which covered the Classical remains after their abandonment in the sixth century AD. At the west, numerous animal bones were recovered, many 40.

The pit, which also contained quantities of lime, seems to date from the 15th-16th century AD and was outside the town limits at that time. The occasion of this large deposit is not clear, though the rarity of butchery marks make it unlikely that it represents the simple disposal of animals slaughtered for food. Lower in this same area, a scatter of about three dozen 13th-century Frankish bronze coins date soon after the Frankish capture of Athens in 1207. To the east lay more walls of the Byzantine settlement which developed in this area in the 10th- 11th century. The general sequence of later remains in this area is now clear: this is the edge of the city, and, depending on its fortunes, Athens expanded or contracted across the area of the excavations. In the seventh to ninth century AD, the area was largely abandoned, with the town clustered around the base of the Acropolis, east of the Stoa of Attalos and within the limits of the post-Herulian wall. When life in the Byzantine world improved in the 10th-12th century, the town expanded out this far and the area was densely inhabited, as indicated by the walls of numerous rooms, the many pithoi and other provisions for storage suggesting a fully urban settlement, and the construction of small churches nearby. With the arrival of the Franks in the 13th century, the area was abandoned once again and used as a dumping ground, hence the large deposits of very fragmentary glazed pottery of the 13th and 14th centuries. The use of the area as a dump continued with the arrival of the Ottomans in the mid 15th century, with the addition of the large deposit of animal bones. Pig bones suggest that the Greek residents of Athens contributed to the debris. From early drawings, it seems that the town expanded out to this area again in the 17th or 18th century, and the dumping ground was pushed further to the northwest. 42. Athens, Agora: Section BH. © ASCSA.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 33 When Edward Dodwell drew the town in 1805, the area is shown covered with houses and the dump (two large mounds labelled staktothiki , i.e. ash heaps) is shown outside the city wall built in 1778, in the area of the present Kerameikos. In the Classical Agora, perhaps the most important investigations conducted by the American excavators in recent years have been in the area of the Stoa Poikile. The west end of the building was identified in 1981 (A/? 28 [1981-1982] 7-10) and the first glimpse of a stretch of its back wall was revealed in 2007 (AR 56 [2009-2010] 3-4; 55 [2008-2009] 3-5). In Section BH (Fig. 42) clearance of the late fill overlying the east end of the Stoa continued in 2010, much of which was deposited when the back wall was robbed out. Soft dark earth removed in the line of the wall produced pottery as late as the 10th century AD. A cross-section of the foundations was exposed (Fig. 43). 43. Athens, Agora: cross-section of the Stoa Poikile foundations. © ASCSA. The orthostates rest on a broad euthynteria 0.92m wide and 0.255m thick, which in turn rests on a foundation of squared blocks set side by side longitudinally, creating a course ca. 1.17m wide x 0.38m high. The bottom course of foundations was formed of blocks 1.2m (ca. 4 ancient feet) long, set as headers. The top two courses were clamped: there are no traces of clamps in the two foundation courses. No dowel holes have been recog- nized. The blocks are all of soft limestone. An intact lamp decorated with a cross indicates the use of the building at least into the fifth century AD. Also recovered were fragments of the terracotta aqueduct which runs along the back wall of the Stoa, believed to be that built by Kimon to bring water out to the grove of the Academy (Plutarch Life of Kimon 13). Two Byzantine wells inside the building were left largely undug for the present. Section BZ (Figs. 44, 45) lies north of the west end of the Stoa Poikile and just east of a north-south road leading out of the Agora square. Throughout antiquity (fifth century BC to fifth century AD), this street was lined along its eastern side by a series of shops. Excavation was conducted in the northern parts of the Classical 44. Athens, Agora: Section BZ. © ASCSA. commercial building to clarify its plan and complex building history. Levels which preceded the building's construction late in the fifth century BC were encountered. Below the floor in Room 6 were several dozen ostraka, most cast against Xanthippos, son of Arriphron (father of Perikles), who was exiled in 484/483 BC, though Lysi- machos and Habron are also represented. In the north scarp of the goat-horn pit in Section B0, a large sculpted fragment of marble, measuring up to 0.75m on a side, began to be uncovered (Fig. 46). The block requires further study, but it clearly depicts a pile of military equipment and served as the base for a trophy or a statue. So far, four or five shields (one with a relief club device), part of a cuirass and the handle of a sword are identified. Several parallels are known from Delos, including shields decorated with clubs, associated with the Macedonian dynasty established after the death of Alexander the Great. This block, too, should probably date to the Hellenistic period (323-146 BC). The weaponry presumably indicates a military victory, but it remains to be seen which dynast or general occupied the base. Anathyrosis at the back, if original, suggests that the block may be part of a larger monument, perhaps therefore a trophy rather than a statue. Its large size and excellent preservation suggest that it had not travelled far and it may well originally have been set up immediately in front of the Stoa Poikile (a favoured place for the display of military success).</page><page sequence="34">34 ROBERT PITT 45. Athens, Agora: Section BZ. © ASCSA. 46. Athens, Agora: sculpted shield from Section B0. © ASCSA. Fortifications A. Theocharaki's fundamental study of the course and phasing of the fortification walls of the city of Athens (Hesperia 80 [2011] 71-156) will remain an indispen- sible tool for Athenian topographers for many years. To the bibliography of this work (references below to sections in Theocharaki's catalogue are divided between the Themistoklean phase [Th] or the post-Herulian [PH]) can now be added a number of excavation reports from this year's ADelt. At 12 and 14 Dipylou Street excava- tions beneath two listed buildings ahead of the creation of the Islamic branch of the Benaki Museum, revealed part of the Athenian proteichisma of the fourth century BC, with additions during the reign of Valerian (third century AD; Fig. 47). The fortification wall was revealed for a length of 12m on Dipylou 14 and 20m on Dipylou 12, at its highest preserved to 13 courses, oriented east- west, of rectangular conglomerate and square limestone blocks. The ditch outside the wall was 9m wide and defined by a wall of large blocks with smaller irregular stones. The ditch was filled in the first century AD as part of the cleaning operation after the Sullan sack of 86 BC, and seven tombs were dug into it in the first to second century AD. Two arms of a wall in the area of the ditch formed part of a Justinianic tower found also in previous excavations. 47. Athens, Dipylon Street 12 and 14: view of the prote- ichisma. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 3rd EPCA. Within the proteichisma and inside the boundaries of the excavation were parts of the fourth-century road which ran around the city above the walls, connecting the various suburbs. In its surface were wheel ruts 1.44m apart. Below the Roman fill were five road layers dating to the fourth century BC. The road was destroyed and essentially removed by two struts of the proteichisma which probably belong to the period of repair. The proteichisma was converted during the reign of Valerian into a wall ca. 3m wide, defined to the north by the same proteichisma and to the south by a wall of conglomerate blocks. The space between the walls was filled with stones, tiles, large marble architectural members, as well as fragments of an epistyle, part of a third-century BC inscribed funerary table and a fifth-century casualty list with 80 names of the tribe Erechtheis (Fig. 48). A small part of the Valerian wall was revealed, continuing to the east. At Lebesi Street just west of the intersection with Iosiph ton Rogon (near to Theocharaki, Th 58 and 59), a 1.5m-long stretch of the eastern arm of the fourth-century BC fortification was revealed (Fig. 49). Built of rectan- gular cut conglomerate blocks, the wall was preserved to a height of three courses and oriented northeast-southwest. At Adrianou 92 (Theocharaki, PH 18) a section of the north side of the post-Herulian walls was revealed, built in the final quarter of the third century AD. The wall is preserved to one course on its north face and four on its east, is oriented east-west and is built of massive limestone blocks with connecting mortar. During the pedestrianization of Aiolou Street part of the west continuation of the ancient Athenian fortifications was revealed which had been investigated in 1973-1974 on the National Bank property at the junction of Aiolou and Sophokleos (Theocharaki, Th 27). All the elements of the fortification were present: the wall, its inner circuit road, the proteichisma , the ditch with its retaining walls and the outer circuit road. The wall was damaged by later building: only one course is preserved of three limestone rectangular blocks oriented east-west and founded in the schist bedrock. The inner circuit road was found parallel to and just north of the wall. Preserved to a length of 3.4m and a width of 8.6m, three road surfaces were found damaged by several pits and a well, with two Roman terra- cotta pipes and a robbed tomb in the top surface. The proteichisma , 3.38m long and preserved to five courses of conglomerate blocks founded in schist, lay 3.1m north of</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 35 the wall. The ditch and its retaining wall lay 9.9 1-1 0.1 2m north of the proteichisma. Inside the ditch was a Late Roman cistern. The outer circuit road north of the ditch, and oriented east-west, was preserved to a length of 3.18m and a width of 2.37m. It was bounded to the south by a ditch, while the north retaining wall or bank was not found. Part of a tower of the north arm of the Long Walls was discovered in properties at 131-133 and 137 Peiraios Street, together with remains of the road running along the outside of the wall. Seven courses are preserved to a height of 3m, the uppermost being a later Roman alteration when the monument was used as a foundation. North of the tower were remains of the road linking the city with the Piraeus. 48. Athens, Dipylon Street 12 and 14: casualty list. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 3rd EPCA. 49. Athens, Lebesi Street: part of the fourth-century forti- fication wall of the city. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 3rd EPCA. In the plot at 137 a cemetery was excavated dating from the end of the fifth century BC with its main period of use in the fourth. One remarkable discovery was made of five katadesmoi in a grave pyre: four rolled lead sheets pierced with an iron nail and one folded. At 105 Eleftherias Street remains of a tower from the first building phase of the south arm of the Long Walls were discovered. Only the foundation of the tower was preserved and one course of the stereobate. A further section of the south arm of the Long Walls (greatest length 23.1m, height 1.77-2.8m, width 4.8m) was excavated at 272-274 Thessalonikis Street, partially built into bedrock. Six courses were preserved and part of the stere- obate as well as part of the mud-brick above. In 2010 the Zea Harbour Project under B. Loven and M. M0ller Nielsen investigated the fortications of the ancient harbour of Mounichia (Figs. 50, 51). The Northern Fortified Mole (M-FM1) has been mostly overbuilt and/or destroyed by modern harbour works, but a substantial section of the west inward side of the structure, alongside and under the modern quay, is preserved to a height of two courses and over a length of 12.7m. Survey dives outside the modern harbour investi- gated the foundations of Tower 3 and the fortified mole to the northeast and west, the latter preserved in situ to a height of three courses of limestone ashlar blocks. The tower foundations and the fortified mole extending north- eastwards between M-T3 and M-T2 are preserved to three or perhaps four courses (Fig. 52).</page><page sequence="36">36 ROBERT PITT 50. Zea Harbour Project, Mikrolimani (ancient Mounichia): areas investigated in 2010. © DIA (Zea Harbour Project). 52. Zea Harbour Project, Mounichia harbour: digital survey of Tower 3. © DIA (Zea Harbour Project). Survey dives on the northern side of Mounichia located the remains of a side wall and four colonnades of the Group 1 Shipsheds (M-Gl), structures tentatively identified as the remains of at least six shipsheds belonging to M-Gl. Large areas of worked bedrock, several architectural elements and an unidentified built structure (M-G1/U:1) were also found. The superstruc- tures of these shipsheds extend at least 35m from the modern shoreline and to a depth of more than 2m. This area will be crucial for understanding sea-level change since antiquity, and thus the harbour-front topography of the ancient Piraeus. Investigations in Zea harbour focused on the shipsheds and other ancient structures in Area 2. Extensive surface cleaning was conducted in the presumed area of the colonnade dividing Shipsheds 34 51. Zea Harbour Project, Mikrolimani (ancient Mounichia): areas 1-9. © DIA (Zea Harbour Project). and 35, and two well-preserved, rock-cut colonnade foundations were found. The surface of a large built structure, believed to be the foundations of Shipsheds 30 and 31, was cleaned. Excavations conducted by the Archaeological Service and reported in ADelt revealed several further remains of shipsheds. At 22 Aktis Koumoundourou Street, parts of four shipsheds at the harbour of Mounichia were investi- gated: three were complete along their width while one was almost destroyed to the west of the property. The structure consists of a continuous wall oriented east-west, parallel with the sea, and four parallel series of cubic bases (or their sub-structures) above which stood the colonnades which held up the wooden pitched roofs. Between these, a sloping stone krepidoma was built of stone slabs: this should extend a few metres into the sea for slipping the keel into the water. The maximum preserved length of the shipsheds within the boundaries of the plot was 21.8m; the width between the column bases is around 5.3m. From a section of a column found nearby (diameter 0.54m), the inter- columnar spacing was around 5.45m. The shipsheds date to the fourth century BC and remained in use until the Roman period when they were probably destroyed by Sulla. At Moutsopoulou Street (Zea harbour) the continu- ation of the shipsheds discovered by Dragatsi in 1885-1886 was revealed. One shipshed was investigated alongside a small part of another which formed its pair. From two preserved column bases the width can be estimated at 5.1m.</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 37 A section of the Piraeus fortications was excavated at 2-4 Vasileos Pavlou Street in an area between the Zea harbour and Mounichia where early topographers had traced the circuit. The wall (length 14.5m and width 3.25m) follows the edge of the rock of Kastella Hill and was made of stone blocks on the outer faces filled with smaller stones. Investigation of the area to the southeast revealed a cluster of 13 bases of dedicatory stelai, sculptures and fragments of votives, including part of an inscribed dedication to Asklepios, replicas of affected body parts (mainly from young boys and girls), a headless statue of a young girl of the fourth century BC holding a goose, and fragments of a votive relief. Metro excavations The large number and depth of the trenches sunk for the various stations, tunnels and ventilation shafts necessary for the extension to the Metro lines in Athens has illumi- nated many periods of city life. At 2-4 Areos Street, excavations for the Monastiraki station, begun in 1997, uncovered an Early Christian complex of four rooms and storage silos. A potter's kiln and a pit coated with clay and showing signs of burning indicate the existence of a workshop in the complex. The kiln fill dates the abandonment of the workshop to the sixth century AD. Built into the wall of the complex, in secondary use, was the base of a Classical sculpture with the signature of Praxiteles: 'lepeav Armr|Tpos Ka['] KopTis I XaiprrrnT)v OiXo&lt;ppovos KTi&lt;piaiEcos I oi aBeAcpoi avE0Eaav I 'ApiaxoSrinos, OiXo9pcov I OiXo9povos Kriq)iaieTs I TTpa^rrEXris EiroiriaE. Building remains of the Early to Late Byzantine periods were found throughout the western part of the excavation. Several silos and pithoi suggest storage areas, one of which contained stacked cakes of raw clay, indicative perhaps of a pottery workshop, thus supporting the view that industrial activity in this area continued throughout the Late Byzantine period. A significant number of (mostly Roman) channels and wells served to supply and drain water, as well as meeting the needs of the workshops throughout Antiquity. During removal of these remains, six Late Mycenaean tombs were discovered, two of which yielded LHIIIB grave goods. From September 1999 to October 2002 excavations at a depth of 20-30m for the tunnel linking Syntagma and Asomaton Squares revealed 120 wells, many filled with antiquities, mostly dating to the Roman, Late Roman and Byzantine periods. The opening of so many wells in this area indicates the exploitation of groundwater from the Eridanos river. In Syntagma Square, a branch of the Peisistratid aqueduct was found cut deep into the rock, consisting of 21 sections of terracotta pipe with cleaning holes, linked with lead and decorated with black bands (Fig. 53). To the east, another branch of the same aqueduct (consisting of three pipe sections) joined it in a T-junction. Between 1997 and 2005 excavations were undertaken for the stations and ventilation shafts of the west extension of Line 3. For the Theseio shaft, an area of 70m2 was investigated between the south side of Ermou Street and the archaeological site of the Kerameikos. At a depth of 6.8m lay house and workshop remains. In the area of the Spyrou Patsi shaft (near the road of the same name and just south of the Sacred Way), was part of one of the many 53. Athens, Syntagma Square: junction between two sections of the Peisistratid aqueduct. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 3rd EPCA. roadside cemeteries along the Sacred Way. The 23 tombs excavated comprised five sarcophagi, seven tile graves, three larnakes, a pyre and seven pit graves, the only finds being a few bones, pieces of strigil and a bronze mirror. An important find was an unlooted larnax containing two pyxides, two alabastroid lekythoi and a black-glazed skyphos, all of the end of the fifth century BC. Other finds from the cemetery date to the end of the fifth and the fourth centuries BC. In the area of the Geoponikis shaft to the west, a 9.3m-long stretch of the ancient Sacred Way ran east-west, parallel to and a short distance south of the modern road. Its north retaining wall (in various phases) was preserved together with at least eight corresponding road layers of the Classical to Late Roman periods. Submycenaean to Archaic pottery was found in a section below the foundation of the lowest retaining wall. The discovery of the road led to the resiting of the shaft further to the north. Fills in the area from the Prophitis Daniel shaft until the bridge over the modern Kephisos are very substantial, as observed in previous excavations, this being the wider area of the Kephisos river found in various places east of its present bed. Excavation here revealed part of the ancient Sacred Way and an offering deposit (Fig. 54). At a depth of 2.9m was a wall (12.3m long and 0.5-0.6m wide) oriented east-west, with three building phases. A 10m- 54.

No building remains were found to the north of the retaining wall. The river bed was encountered here at a depth of 5.5m, and at 5.76-6.02m two successive road layers contained Geometric sherds. It is believed that this is the Sacred Way of the Geometric period, which was destroyed by flooding and moved further south. At the west side of the trench the road was disturbed by a deposit ca. 3m in diameter, containing roof tiles, two heads of Archaic figurines and many Eleusinian kernoi. The kernoi are specifically related to the worship of Demeter, and this may therefore be a sanctuary deposit (noting that Pausanias [1.37.2] mentions a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, Athena and Poseidon in this area). Finds date from the Archaic to Late Roman periods. At Elaionas Station (1200m2) remains of workshops and part of a cemetery were revealed. Sporadic finds of furnace materials (clay, bronze and lead) and the presence of hearths and fire pits suggest the use of the area as a workshop in the Hellenistic period. In the area of the station entrance, part of a Hellenistic cemetery was found with 14 tombs, mostly cist graves, two of which were built of marble funerary stelae in secondary use, while the remainder were simple pits without goods. At the eastern ventilation shaft of the station, at a depth of 6.5m, were three stanchions of the bridge over the ancient Kephisos, composed of three series of rectangular marly limestone blocks preserved to a height of four courses. Excavation of the west ventilation shaft a few metres further west, revealed a possible peribolos (walls of river stones and limestone slabs in secondary use). Parts of large pithoi were found, a circular tile construction in Area 1 and some pit pyres, perhaps from a workshop. North of this, the Sacred Way ran east- west for 15m (with a maximum width of 4.5m). At the Knosou shaft, a short distance from the west shaft, deposits of the Kephisos river were found, plus part of the prehistoric Sacred Way which was abandoned in the Geometric period and moved further south. Cemeteries During excavation of a 331m2 property at Diamantopoulou 10, an important part of the Classical core of the Kynosarges cemetery was revealed, comprising 159 tombs near to the large Roman building known as the Hadrianic Gymnasium. Apart from a few Early Helladic sherds, the oldest burial is a Geometric enchytrismos in an amphora (T21). Many tombs date around the middle of the sixth century, but the use of the cemetery peaked in the fifth and fourth centuries BC (Fig. 55). The burial customs and the types of graves are identical with those of other, better known Athenian cemeteries: deep pits dug into schist, limestone sarcophagi, covered tile graves, pyres (some free, others in pits), small clay larnakes with lids for child burials, enchytrismoi , etc. In the Hellenistic and Roman periods the number of graves declines, while the latest tombs date around the first to second century AD. An intact horos of the fifth century BC (1.05m high) inscribed [Ai]o$ [TT]oAiecos a(3aTov indicates the presence in the area of a sanctuary. One tomb, 'the tomb with the offering trench', was an elongated narrow trench containing a dense accumulation of pottery showing signs of burning. It was disturbed in 55.

Red-figure pottery includes: two type 1 lebetes gamikoi and two other smaller type 2 examples; two large hydriae; a pyxis with depictions of the nine Muses, each named (Fig. 56), and a smaller pyxis with a funerary scene. Among many fragments of white lekythoi was one with a standing female figure by a funerary stele. Black- glaze pottery included a large kylix; a Corinthian type A skyphos; two lekythoid aryballoi; four black-glazed phialae and two lekanes with lids. Small finds include two small identical bone studs, two bone rings and a black-glazed pyramidal loomweight.</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 39 The mound adjacent to the offering pit was made of river stones and material probably from a tomb or tombs. On the surface was a small marble lion (preserved height 0.47, length 0.48m), as well as a pair of standing naked lead figures (0.12m high) inscribed on the chest of the male 2r||jid5ris KaTaSeSeTai, and of the female Muvvcb KaTa5e5eTai. The many finds from the cemetery include tens of lekythoi of the workshop of the Megaira Painter; nine lead katadesmoi folded and pierced with nails; five or six Early Classical standing female figurines; the bronze panelling of a box; and gold leaf, probably from a funerary wreath. Within the primarily Late Roman cemetery of Kynosarges, which spread east of the city, excavations at Paraskevopoulou Street revealed 47 Late Hellenistic to Early Christian tombs comprising two Hellenistic rock-cut graves, nine Late Roman built cist graves, an enchytrismos , two Late Roman tile graves (without goods), 20 vaulted tombs with brick arches and plaster inside, and four grave complexes containing 13 urns. The built cists develop to the west part of the plot and are densely laid out. Most are of unworked stones and brick with mortar, but tombs 27 and 13 were built of stone slabs. They are variously oriented either west-east or north-south: most contained single burials but there were instances of multiple burials. The grave complexes were large rectangular struc- tures, separated inside into individual rectangular parallel graves covered with stone or marble slabs (some in secondary use). Many graves held multiple burials (tomb 35 looks like an ossuary) and must have been used probably by the same family for many years. The dead were laid supine with head always to the west. Goods included pottery (unguentaria and oinochoae) unpainted or decorated with stripes, lamps, jewellery (bronze buckles 57. Athens, Diamantopoulou 1: the presumed Hadrianic Gymnasium. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 3rd EPCA. and a cross) and bronze coins, but the majority of burials were without goods. One fifth-century AD lamp was inscribed ZQTHPIAZ. Seventeen further tombs of the Late Roman cemetery in the area of Kynosarges were investigated at 16 Vourvachi Street. The graves were oriented east-west following Christian custom; all date to the fourth to early sixth century AD. Only two contained grave goods, notably tomb 8, a vaulted cist tomb with an oinochoe, glass beads and remains of gold around the head of the deceased. Tomb 10 contained a stele inscribed KOIMHTHPION ©EOAQPOY. At Diamantopoulou 1, substantial foundations were discovered of a further section of the associated large Roman building (restored dimensions 80 x 60m) investi- gated by the British School at Athens in 1886-1887 and in 1970 by Travlos, and thought to be the Hadrianic Gymnasium of Kynosarges (Figs. 57, 58). In 2002-2003 excavation to the northwest of the archaeological site of the Kerameikos at 85-87 Peiraios Street uncovered the continuation of the road from the Dipylon to the Academy, dating from the Classical period to the sixth century AD. During the Late Roman to Early Byzantine period it was 2.5-3m wide, but its width in earlier periods could not be determined in the excavated area. A roadside cemetery of the sixth to seventh century AD is related to the Justinianic or post-Justinianic phase of the Kerameikos. Its establishment in the sixth century is connected with the Justinianic phase during which a new fortification was built on the remains of the Themistoklean wall. The cemetery thus belongs to the last period in the history of the Kerameikos. Excavation revealed a total of 20 vaulted tombs in clusters of three to four, with their narrow sides at the road. Goods were simple: small undecorated prochoes and a few metal finds (two spoons and a buckle). The tombs contained graves of men, women and children together. The absence of Christian symbols, the indication that the dead were placed in sacks sewn with iron needles then found in situ by the skull and the buckle type suggest that the graves may be related to the first foray of the Slavs into Athens around AD 580. 58.

Among the mass of new evidence for the road network of the city should be noted: at the Junction of Serron 2, Konstantinoupoleos and Platonos a section of an ancient road (11.5m long, 4.75m wide) oriented northeast- southwest and roadside cemetery built in the fourth century BC with strong retaining walls and rebuilt at the end of the second century. It must be associated with the ancient road of the Demosion Sema (to which it runs perpendicular) which leads from the Dipylon to the Academy and has been found at various points in this area (including at a location just west of this plot, below the surface of Serron Street). The road found at Serron 2 is probably a secondary route linking the road to the Academy to the east with that to the Hippios Kolonos. If the same road continues to the west, it probably links the main artery to the road from the Sacred Gate to the Academy, and then to the Sacred Way, thus joining the three main routes of the southwest section of ancient Athens. Two sections of ancient roads, a Late Archaic to Late Hellenistic cemetery and workshop remains of the fourth century BC were revealed at the Junction of Ag. Asomaton, Psaromiligkou and K. Samuel Streets in 1999-2003, 300m north of the archaeological site of the Kerameikos (Fig. 59). To the west of the plot, towards Ag. Asomaton Street, road 1 (20.5m long, 2.7-3. 4m wide) led north-south. It is dated stratigraphically from the Early Classical to the Roman period. 59. Athens, junction of Ag. Asomaton, Psaromiligkou, and K. Samuel Streets: excavated area around two roads, a cemetery and workshop. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 3rd EPCA. At the southeast part of the excavation, a 21.6m-long stretch of a main arterial route from the Eriai Gate to Hippios Kolonos led northwest-southeast. A cemetery to the east of the road contained a peribolos of limestone blocks and a burial platform to its north of red limestone blocks to a height of five courses. To the east of these were 33 tombs, mostly pyres but also one marble cist grave, three pit graves, two covered, one with built sides, and a mound, dating from the early fifth century to the middle of the second century BC. The oldest phase of the cemetery is linked with a burial mound (2.22m high, 5.4m wide, with nine courses of mud-brick surrounding the tomb) which continues east below K. Samuel Street. This was disturbed around 450 BC by two pyres (T30, T33) in the northwest part of the mound. T29 was built of mud- brick and contained lekythoi of the Beldam type. To the east of the road were 14 Hellenistic graves (300-1 50BC). In the southeast of the excavation area was the north external wall of a Classical structure, much of which had previously been discovered below Psaromiligkou Street. The masonry is the irregular polygonal characteristic of the fourth century BC. Southwest of road 2, were two Late Roman walls, into one of which a marble head of Caracalla was built. An industrial area lay between the two roads, with many pits cut into the bedrock. One rock-cut well contained Panathenaic amphora sherds of the end of the fourth century BC. The foundations of a second-century AD grave platform were revealed in the north of the trench. A road was revealed outside the north arm of the Long Walls at the Junction of Peiraios and Kastanitsis Streets (Kaminia). This appears to be the road mentioned by ancient sources as the main arterial road linking the city of Athens with the Piraeus. A section of the road outside the north arm of the Long Walls was found at the Junction of 83 Peiraios and Kastanitsis Streets, which had been found in the property of the National Bank on the opposite corner. Attiki Odos Excavations for the southern extension of the Attiki Odos brought to light many areas of archaeological interest around Koropl. We note in particular the finding of pieces of Early Helladic litharge, some of the earliest evidence in Greece for silver smelting. By the ruins of the Church of Ag. Andreas, next to the east side of the bridge of the Markopoulos junction, an Early Helladic wall ran north- south. At the plot of the Lidl property and Chatzi Street study continued of the south of an EHII building, and 25m south of this were parts of an EHI building with a south wall built in herringbone style. A large number of important finds were made, including EHI and ECycI pottery, a terracotta head of a bull in brown Urfinis and remains of metal-working which included some bowl- shaped litharge with a series of small indentations on the bottom. Similar litharge was found during excavations at Keratea, Velatouri Hill, where excavation in the prehis- toric settlement was undertaken to assess the transition from Early Helladic to Middle Helladic, and in particular to ascertain the existence and character of the controversial (for Attica) EHIII period (2300-2000 BC). A trench in the south side of the summit produced Middle Helladic pottery with only a thin layer with Early Helladic sherds above stereo. Pottery included matt-painted and Minyan wares.</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 41 At Porto Raphti, Skyrou Street, a Mycenaean chamber tomb was found with its dromos destroyed but clearly oriented southwest-northeast. Bones were recovered near the entrance and a small pit to the west, covered with three slabs, contained the bones of an infant. The dead were accompanied by 14 pots. Three and a half metres to the west of the first tomb was another chamber tomb with the dromos oriented southwest-northeast and 3.8m long. The entrance was closed by a wall of rough stones. The deceased was accompanied by 11 pots and an animal figurine. At the end of the fifth century, tile graves were dug above the chamber and dromos, containing aryballoid lekythoi. The finds from the Mycenaean tombs date to LHIIIC, the period of the cemetery of Perati. The Classical graves belong to a previously known cemetery with scattered graves to the southeast along Athinon Avenue. During the widening of Varis-Koropiou Avenue at Lambrika excavation continued in the Early Helladic settlement. On the south side of the avenue the northern continuation of the ditches from the Vardalachaki plot was found, and to the north of the Apostolidi plot a small EHI house. Slightly to the west, another large artificial ditch was used to collect rain water. On the north side of the avenue was part of a metal- working facility for silver and lead: dating to EHI, this is the oldest discovered in the Aegean. It consists of a series of pits and two series of small cavities, filled with hundreds of pieces of bowl-shaped litharge with 10 small indentations on the bottom (Fig. 60). 60. Lambrika: bowl-shaped litharge. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 2nd EPCA. On the northwest side, where the EHII settlement is located, fragmentary building remains consist of small single-roomed (and rarely two-roomed) houses. A large road (65m long, 3m wide, with built sides) led east-west: its north side is also the peribolos of the EHII settlement. Olympic works Merenda Perhaps the most wide ranging excavations to take place as part of the preparations for the Olympic Games were the works for the New Olympic Hippodrome completed in 2003 at Merenda (for the Classical deme of Myrrinous; see E.P Vivliodetis, O Srjijos tou Muppivouvro s: rj opyavoooTj Kai rj ioTopia tou [Athens 2007]; Fig. 61). Reports have been selected and merged by site and arranged approximately by period. Site 12. To the west of the Hippodrome complex were the remains of a small Early Neolithic settlement ( ca . 6000 BC) over an area of ca. 2500m2. Small timber-framed huts were found, some with stone foundations, thatched and with mud-plaster. At the southwest side were remains of a peribolos of woven wood fencing. Four schematic figurines of seated figures were collected. The area around the settlement contained pits probably for water collection, as well as a pit dwelling which from the matt-painted and incised pottery dates to the Late Neolithic period (mid fifth millennium BC). Site 13. At the top of a small hill in the northern part of the complex was a small settlement of the end of the Neolithic to EHII, comprising five clusters of dug-out chambers (Figs. 62, 63). Those that had not collapsed continued in use into EHII. Important metallurgic finds included bronze slag, litharge and a lead clamp (the oldest lead object from eastern Attica). At Site 4, in an area where a Mycenaean chamber tomb had previously been found, were remains of a building, four bull figurines and Middle Helladic sherds. Just to the west of the Mycenaean remains was a small circular EHI building, perhaps a workshop for stone tools. Site 28. On the slope of the hill to the northeast of the plain of Merenda was a Mycenaean cemetery with five small chamber tombs with long dromoi and chambers ca. 2.5m in diameter, dating to the LHIIIC period. Site 26. At the southern boundary of the complex, 120m east of the Geometric cemetery along a farm road running east-northeast, was another Geometric to Classical cemetery. Outside the fenced area were five Geometric tombs, pit or cist graves containing 72 offerings of which 67 were pots. Immediately to the north of the Geometric tombs were Archaic cremations, and north again a large funerary peribolos and an exedra. As indicated by an inscribed marble funerary lekythos, the peribolos belongs to a previously unknown family of Myrrinous, that of Eukles and Ischyrios (Fig. 64). Site 5. The eastern cemetery consisted of eight cist graves cut into the rock and four cremations. Within one of the cuttings were two bronze urns. Pottery dated from the second half of the fifth century to the beginning of the fourth. Site 11. Approximately 200m northeast of the cemetery in which the Phrasiklea kore was found in 1972 was a large cemetery of the eighth to the fourth century BC. Sixty two tombs were found, mostly pyres and enchytrismoi with much Geometric and Archaic pottery, and an offering table with representations of fantastic animals (Fig. 65). Site 8. To a small Classical building with a stoa was added a large Hellenistic hall to the east and a stoa on the south side, and in the Roman period a workshop area. From the form of the building and the finds (a lead weight of V4 of a stater and a bronze public voting ballot) this seems to be a small public building.</page><page sequence="42">42 ROBERT PITT 61.

In a large cemetery immediately northeast of that in which the statue of Phrasikleia was found, lay a building complex and a farm complex. One Late Neolithic and one Early Bronze Age house were uncovered to the west of them. Site 9. Immediately to the west of Site 5 was a small sanctuary with a rectangular peribolos (33 x 26m) of limestone blocks. A schist slab was inscribed with the name N ANN ION. At the same depth as the peribolos was a three-roomed building above a layer with Early Geometric to Geometric pottery. 63.

To the right of the entrance, by the east wall of the peribolos, was a small bath with two built tubs. To the north were the remains of two rooms, one of which (to the south) contained many pots and a small bothros. The remaining area outside the peribolos was a tree-lined garden with a small rock-cut cistern, with many amphora and kantharos sherds, perhaps a small shrine to Aphrodite. Site 15. Some 250m from the Sanctuary of Aphrodite, a small road ran from the southeast ancient road to the north to a large elliptical peribolos of large stones. By the entrance was a circular pit with Middle Helladic pottery, prochoes and parts of two polishers, while in a large pit in the middle of the peribolos was a small Late Geometric cup. Sherds from this area are mostly Geometric and Late Classical in date, with some Mycenaean. These findings suggest that the peribolos is a temenos, perhaps linked to a dedicatory inscription to Apollo found in Merenda. Site 16. Towards the middle of the Olympic complex, the stereobate of a large building (20 x 10m) of limestone blocks probably belonged to a temple. The only surviving architectural member was a marble sima. Archaic lamps and pottery and few Late Roman lamps were recovered. Site 23. From the west side of the north road and 70m south of the periboloi of the north cemetery begins a small road leading to a small sanctuary with a rectangular peribolos and monumental door. At the northeast corner of the peribolos are the remains of a small building with two small bases, and rooms at the west and the south sides. A few loomweights were found with the bases. Outside the west side of the peribolos was a well, from which was recovered a high base with a dedicatory inscription: SENOOQN IEPEYI ANE0HKE T7AI2 OIAOHENO MNHMEION AYTOY KAME OPATPIQ All. The sanctuary is therefore probably dedicated to Zeus Phratrios. Site 24. A small square building with a floor of clay tiles was investigated. Nine steps are preserved in the east side. In the interior were many marble architectural members: two arched epistyles, parts of an unfluted column and pilasters, two capitals with palmettes and Corinthian capitals, which date to the first to second century AD. Also a marble winch beam of a well inscribed: THN KPHNHN TTOI(H)IAI [--] KAI TO T7EPIITOMION [ - ]. This seems to be of the second century AD and probably belonged to a well supplying water for the nearby sanctuary. Site 30. A large ancient road found at the east side of the complex linked the demes of the south Mesogeia (Kephale, Potamioi, Thorikos) to those in the north (Philiades, Halai Araphinides, Araphina). Marathon Excavations for the Olympic Rowing Facility at Marathon between 2001-2004 revealed the following. The deepest levels are in a layer of red earth where the bottom of the marsh was in its initial dry phase. Remains of activity here included wooden structures and pits which pre-date the third millennium. To the Early Helladic period date two pits and two houses (Bl and B2) along the east side of the trench, and another (2t1) at the west side (Fig. 66). At several points around the marsh were small stone soroi and animal bones with remains of burning - probably small outdoor hearths of various periods. Three buildings were founded in a layer of peat which in this period was dry and stable enough to accommodate fixed installations. Large quantities of Geometric pottery were found at three points inside the peat, with Early Helladic in the lower levels. At the end of the Early Helladic period the area was flooded, but it must have dried again to support Geometric habitation, although no building remains were found. 66. Marathon, Kato Souli-Schinias: Early Helladic House B2. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 2nd EPCA.</page><page sequence="44">44 ROBERT PITT The foundation of the two-roomed House B2 was preserved to two to three courses. Close by was a pit with EHII sherds in the bottom. North of house B2 was a large pit containing Early Helladic and Middle Helladic sherds above a layer with much Early Helladic (mostly EHII) pottery and some EHIII sherds in a cavity at the bottom. The rectangular House Bl just south of B2, produced Early Helladic and Geometric sherds from the fill. Ceramics collected, including saucers and plates, large phialae or lekanes and some sauceboat fragments, date the use of the house to EHII. Other finds include stone tools, shells and a large number of cores, blades and chips of obsidian, as well as a greenstone pendant in the shape of a foot. House J.T was a rectangular, two-roomed Early Helladic dwelling along the west side of the lake. The upper courses of the walls were of mud-brick, in one wall in a herringbone pattern. Geometric to Late Classical sherds were recovered around the area. Along the length of the road to Kato Souli, to the north of the marsh, was a cemetery of the Archaic period to the third century BC. Sixty one tombs were found along an ancient road which ran southwest-northeast parallel to the modern road. The majority was immediately below the surface. Two hundred metres south of the first cemetery were a further 26 tombs, mostly enchytrismoi and cremations of the Late Geometric period to the fifth century. The majority were enchytrismoi in amphorae, pithoi, lekanes and hydriae (Figs. 67, 68). 67. Marathon, Kato Souli-Schinias: enchytrismos within an amphora. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 2nd EPCA. Two hundred and forty metres south of the north edge of the lake lay the bases of two kilns, probably used for the firing of tiles and perhaps pithoi. Fill around them contained pottery of various periods from the Geometric to the Byzantine. Near Kato Souliou Street, 80m from the cemetery and the ancient road, part of a large Classical farm complex was excavated. Sixteen rooms were revealed, and to the north side the strong foundations of a square tower-like structure, which appears to belong to an earlier phase. Terracotta plates from olive presses were found, plus stone grinders, loomweights, lead weights, lead clamps, bronze arrowheads, iron and bronze nails, 90 coins (56 in a hoard) and two inscribed limestone slabs. Pottery consisted of household wares, most under- rated, and many black-glazed sherds, also pithoi, amphorae, kantharoi, olpes, skyphoi, phialae and plates. The complex was in use from the first half of the fourth until the beginning of the third century BC. 68.

The retaining walls were in place along almost the whole length, with at least three construction phases. Eight successive road surfaces were excavated, dating from the Classical to the Late Roman period, plus one of the early 20th century (Fig. 70). The continuation of the road was located further on, with three roadside buildings. A curved section of the eastern retaining wall abutted the northern wall of a single- roomed structure. The southern wall of this structure may be the pronaos of a small roadside shrine enclosed by a peribolos, whose west wall was part of the east retaining wall of the road, while part of the south was found a short distance to the south of the sanctuary. The entrance to the sekos was at the east. The sanctuary dates to the Hellenistic period: inside it were six miniature cups, part of the neck of a lekythos with relief decoration of erotes and a clay disk with the face of a female figure. Beneath the south wall of the peribolos was a deposit containing nine kernoi, part of a plastic lekythos with the feet of a female figure (Fig. 71) and many fragments of domestic pottery, as well as Late Classical amphorae and cups and many miniature cups. This may be a sanctuary of Demeter. East of Thivaidos Street, Kato Kiphisia were two small roadside shrines and other sacred areas within a peribolos, part of a Classical road and two Roman instal- 69.

The main sanctuary to the south consisted of a small square room with an entrance to the east and walls of conglom- erate blocks. In front of it were parts of three dedicatory inscriptions. One, dating to the fourth century BC, was an honorific deme decree for an unknown individual who had planted trees in the Sanctuary of Dionysos. Part of an epistyle of the funerary monument of Dionysios ([--] Y2IOY) was found east of the ancient road. Part of a life-size marble male figure found inside the naiskos perhaps belonged to the cult statue of Dionysos. Within the sanctuary was a piece of a marble arm of a female statue smaller than life size, terracotta figurines of enthroned females, part of a head of a cat, a dog, two bird figurines and a series of clay votive ears and horns of bulls, as well as ritual vessels, all dating from the mid fifth until the mid fourth century BC.</page><page sequence="46">46 ROBERT PITT 72. Megara: excavation sites, 2004. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 3rd EPCA. Very near the sanctuary to the north is a small area with an entrance at the east between pilasters. Figurines were recovered of birds and seated goddesses, a marble figurine of a woman, and an arm and torso of a marble female statuette, suggesting that this is a naiskos to Aphrodite. This sanctuary probably belonged to the deme of Upper Pergase. Farmsteads East of the Sanctuary of Dionysos, mentioned above, on Thivaidos Street, near to Seneca Street, a Late Roman farmhouse was revealed with a central rectangular courtyard and six rooms arranged on three sides. A large stoa opened off the south side: a short distance from the courtyard was the wall of an external peribolos. Room 1 on the eastern side contained a large pithos, parts of other storage vessels, a large number of bronze coins and many terracotta loomweights. Near the south peribolos was part of a marble mortgage horos of the fourth century BC (TTEnpaiJEVOu em Xuoei). The beneficiary was Andromenes of the deme Paionidai and the price was 4,000 drachmai (XXXX). A rare instance of a residence preserved in Acharnes came to light in excavations around 1km north of the sanctuaries on Thivaidos Street to the west of</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 47 Monimatiou Street: a small farmhouse dating to the Early to Late Classical period with at least two (fifth- and fourth- century) phases. In the first phase the building was ellip- tical and contained lamps and animal bones. On top of this structure was a later room and a large courtyard to the west with a peribolos. A large and rich Roman farmhouse was excavated at Ortansias and Paschalias Streets, with a central open courtyard, developed in successive building phases from the Early to Late Roman periods. The estate had its own pottery workshop with a kiln, storage areas, a honey production installation, and baths with hypocausts and warm and cold rooms. The complex was destroyed in the fourth century AD and the area used as a Late Roman to Early Christian cemetery with burials in pots and pit graves. One grave contained a marble inscription: TraiSi rjpcoi. Finds from the house include domestic pottery, lamps, a marble weight, part of a terracotta relief plaque with the head of the god Hermes, Roman and Byzantine bronze coins, and an inscription on a headless Herm stele of the first to second century AD. This inscription is from the ancient deme of Pergasidai and mentions one of its citizens and some hydraulic works (ou8ev 69eiXonevou 6e Tfjs TTEpidKTou). Another inscription among the building material of the house was a horos of the fourth century. Within the peribolos wall to the northwest of the house was the tomb of a victorious pentathlete with pieces of a column krater of the beginning of the fifth century BC. At 126 Dimokratias Avenue (Gerovouno, Acharnes) excavations for a side road of the Attiki Odos uncovered a Late Roman farmhouse with two wings immediately west of Dimokratias Avenue. Inside the eastern part of the house was an area with hearths and large storage pots. Near the north part of the west wall were two enchytrismoi inside an amphora. One room had a flight of stairs to an upper level. At least two chronological phases could be observed from the construction of the walls: in the first phase the walls are built with irregular stones of small and medium size and lime mortar, while in the second phase they are wider and built with larger stones and less mortar (mainly on the insides). Both phases date to the Late Roman period (third to fifth century AD). The enchytrismoi are from the sixth century AD. Within and around the complex, 40 bronze coins were collected, plus many fragments of glass vessels, a column base, lamps, pithoi and two bread stamps with a cross design. Megara The detailed reports and plans of excavations conducted at Megara by the 3rd EPCA between 2001-2004 have done much to further our understanding of the topography of this ancient city (Fig. 72). Several sections of the city walls have been excavated: At 1 Thermopylon Street a stretch of the walls (15m long, 5.35m wide) running northwest- southeast was preserved at the euthynteria and the lowest course. The north and south faces were built of sandstone blocks, and the fill was of small stones and earth. The mud- brick which covered the eastern part of the walls was found in situ on the upper surface. Pottery dated to the end of the fourth century BC. At 21 Evpalinou a 15.9m-long section of the proteichisma was preserved to seven courses, built of blocks of grey limestone in the isodomic system. At the eastern side of the property and in contact with the outer north face of the proteichisma , a stairway of nine steps was preserved. The fill of the wall produced domestic pottery (amphorae, lekanes), while utilitarian closed vessels (an amphora, a black-glazed drinking vessel and black-glazed skyphos sherds) collected from the foundation ditch of the wall dated the construction to the second half of the fourth century BC. A further section of the proteichisma was revealed 78.5m away from this plot at 47 Evpalinou Street, oriented east-west and of greyish limestone isodomic masonry five courses high. At the north face of the west section of the wall was a flight of five steps. The fills contained Late Classical domestic pottery. A parallel wall in the same stone, 11.3m north of the proteichisma and preserved to three courses, appears to be a side wall probably of the same date. North of the ancient city walls excavation on an unnamed road at Tachi north of Alepochoriou Street revealed 28 graves of a cemetery. All the burials were in sarcophagi of shelly limestone, the dead supine with hands parallel to the bodies and heads to the north. The graves were of three periods. (1) First half of the fifth century BC: grave 4, a child burial, contained a peplophoros figurine, the head of a female figure and parts of an egg; grave 6 contained the burial of two adults with a Corinthian kotyle, kylikes, a black-figure lekythos and a lekythos of the Cock Group; 20 contained an adult burial with a lekythos; 21 contained 21 pots including a black-figure lekythos with Amazons and Athena fighting the Giants, a lekythos with Dionysos and Ariadne and another of the Cock Group, Corinthian black-figure kotyles and a pyxis (Fig. 73). 73.

(3) Roman period: graves 24, 25, 27, 28. A peribolos contained graves 27 and 28. Finds included glass unguen- taria, bronze coins, six gold leaves and parts of strigils. Nine Archaic tombs were discovered in the northern part of the city at 12 Thiseos Street. Three (1, 5, 8) were cist graves with monolithic cover slabs, five (2, 3, 4, 6, 9) were sarcophagi and one (7) a pit grave: they were oriented either north-south (1, 4, 5, 6) or east-west (3, 7, 8, 9). The tombs contained one to four burials, the deceased supine, arms bent at the elbows. The dead in those tombs oriented west-east had their heads to the east, while in those oriented north-south the heads were to the south (except in grave 1 where it was to the north). Sarcophagi 2, 3 and 6 contained child burials and the remainder adults, but sarcophagus 9 contained one adult and one child. Graves 1, 4 and 6 had no goods, but other graves contained pottery (aryballoi, undecorated oinochoae, kotyliskoi and one-handled kyathoi), terracotta items (pyramid loom weights) and bronze objects (rings and pins) (Fig. 74). Tomb 1, a cist grave of grey limestone with a monolithic cover, contained an adult with no goods, but the west long side of the tomb bore the inscription OIAONOZ in letters 0.1 1-0. 14m high, dating to the sixth century BC. 74.

The volume of reported material means that there are some significant emerging trends visible in the data for 2010. First, as in other areas of Greece, there is a significant push towards interdisciplinary research, with archaeological science, careful contextualized readings of primary sources and new methodologies visible within single projects. Second, there is also an increased focus on issues of scale and spatial relationships - both across landscapes, in the continued use of archaeological field survey and various remote sensing techniques, and within landscapes, in the exploration of surface/sub-surface relationships. And third, there is evidence of a much more critical approach to topography that seeks to under- stand not only the physical layout of urban spaces, but the ways in which cultural memory shapes those spaces over time. Archaic Archaeological discoveries relating to the Archaic period were relatively rare in 2010, especially as compared to previous years of AR (55 [2008-2009]; 56 [2006-2007] especially). The vast majority of reported work continues to focus on religious structures, associated sanctuaries and cemeteries. In the Corinthia, east of ancient Corinth, at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia (as reported by E. Gebhard [ASCSA/Chicago]), study of identified vessels of the sixth and fifth centuries BC continued. They were likely associated with the sacrificial feast that accompanied the Isthmian games. These included large stewpots and covered serving platters, as well as kotyles, skyphoi and one-handled cups. The pottery distribution suggests that only a portion of the meat was roasted on the altar, while the rest was boiled and served near the large circular reservoir. South of Kleonai, at ancient Tenea (modern Klenia, near Chiliomodi), police seized large parts of two kouroi from antiquities thieves. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism reports that kouros A is 1.82m high and kouros B 1.78m high, and that both are of marble and likely from the same workshop. They date the statues to ca. 650-625 BC. Rescue excavations at the reported find- spot discovered the right foot and part of the base of kouros A and the right foot of kouros B, associated marble sarcophagi and an extensive ancient cemetery, at present comprising 43 Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic graves. The kouroi are to be restored at Corinth prior to display. The recovery of these kouroi is both a blessing and curse: not only were antiquities thieves appre- hended, but a previously unknown cemetery was saved from further depredations. However, the continued focus of illicit activities on cemeteries and religious sites is undoubtedly distorting our knowledge of funerary rites and associated social structures for particular areas. Southwest of Kleonai, at Nemea, work continues on the reconstruction of the Temple of Zeus, focusing on sections of entablature. Targeted excavation in two areas of the sanctuary (D/E-ll/12 and E/F/G-19; Fig. 75) sought to enhance understanding of early historic and prehistoric levels, and produced well-stratified deposits of Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic material. The continued refinement of the ceramic chronology at the site is of the utmost importance, given the generally patchy under- standing of local coarseware production endemic throughout the Peloponnese. Excavation east of the Heroon (Area E/F/G-19) produced evidence suggesting three major phases to the Heroon: pre-Archaic (perhaps Geometric), Archaic (perhaps sixth-century) and Hellenistic to Roman phases. The foundations of the Classical/Hellenistic enclosure wall in places lie directly on top of the Archaic wall and elsewhere on fill, suggestive of an increase in investment and perhaps expansion of activity around the Heroon in the Classical/Hellenistic periods. Within the Archaic matrix, characterized by yellow soils, were several whole vessels. Layers of soil and cobbles were laid angled in alternating directions, east-west and west-east, but always up-slope to the east. Cut into this was a pit with evidence of burning and postholes, that may suggest a small tent-like structure (Fig. 76). Such deliberate handling of the landscape is curious, and it is not clear how the different elements relate. Another trench was opened to explore the area of stones (the 'rock garden') found in 1980 west of the Hellenistic Heroon wall (Hesperia 50 [1981] 60-65). The date and function of this stone packing remain unclear: it may be associated with religious architecture (perhaps a mound) or landscape alteration to aid drainage around the Heroon. The Archaic phase is represented by some pottery consisting of fine kotyle sherds, plus some whole vessels (kotyles, miniature kraters, a mug, small bowl and olpe). The clean matrix suggests intentional deposition within a relatively circumscribed period of time: no finds are earlier than the later Archaic period and none is later than the first half of the fifth century BC. A ground penetrating radar survey, with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), was conducted by A. Sarris and N. Papadopoulos (Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas). The aim was to map the stratigraphy of the sediments and address the question of the location of the hippodrome. In conjunction with excavations in D/E-ll/12, no positive evidence of the hippodrome was found, though several interesting anomalies were identified. These will be examined through excavation in subsequent seasons. Similar work at Mycenae, in the Argolid, corroborates this picture of use over time. Continuing excavations in the lower city of Mycenae, reported by S. Iakovides (ASA), uncovered distinct separations between Bronze Age material and more recent Geometric and Archaic constructions (Fig. 77). The previously reported (AR 54 [2007-2008] 27-29; 55 [2008-2009] 19-21) Hellenistic structures (including a potter's workshop and an apsidal building) were shown to interface with structures from earlier periods, re-using wall foundations and building material in some cases. Similar re-use was evident for the Archaic period in a strong Mycenaean wall that had been extended to the south. The evidence points to punctuated habitation in this area, with strong foci of activity in the Archaic and Hellenistic periods (and in the Geometric and Bronze Age), with little evidence for extensive use in intervening periods.</page><page sequence="50">50 DANIEL STEWART 75.

Most frequently, material of this period forms a part of multi- component sites. This makes discussion of purely 'Classical' material quite difficult. What is interesting, however, is the narrative that emerges when this material is contextualized amongst other historic periods. For example, south of ancient Corinth, near modern Mapsos and on the ancient road to Argos, lies Kleonai. Excavations, directed by T. Mattern (DAI/Marburg), focused on buildings close to the agora, adjacent to a road or path that led to the southern city gate. An apsidal structure, likely a Byzantine church (Fig. 78), points to the religious use of the area. Remains of Late Classical and Hellenistic monuments and statue fragments were previ- ously reported in 2006, and an inscribed block with erased inscription was recovered in 2010. The church is likely representative of religious conti- nuity. That it was the inheritor of an earlier sanctuary is perhaps indicated by the earlier walls and exedrae, by numerous and sometimes well-preserved Late Classical and Hellenistic spolia (especially capitals and columns; Fig. 79) and by the rise in terrain in this area of the agora. The unusual location of this agora and the course of the city wall to the north may reflect an extension of the city perhaps related to the integration of new inhabitants after the conquest of Mycenae in 465/464 BC. 79. Kleonai: overhead view of trenches from the south. ©DAI. The importance of broader contextualization can also be seen among the poleis of the ancient Triphylia regional survey in Elis. Located southwest of Olympia, the area was variously controlled by Eleans, Spartans and Arcadians in antiquity. This survey aims to study and record the visible remains of the various poleis of the region, including Hypanam, Epitalion, Pyrgos, Samikon, Platiana and Vrestos (amongst others). By itself, the 78.

Examined diachronically, however, that material suggests some interesting develop- ments. The fifth season of fieldwork was carried out under the directorship of J. Heiden (DAI). Primarily, the extent and duration of occupation in this area was elucidated. On a plateau south of modern Gryllos, a settlement, perhaps corresponding to ancient Hypana, was dated by surface finds from the Mycenaean to Hellenistic period. On the summit of the highest mountain in the area, Mount Minthi, an 8 x 8m foundation was discovered in association with a Byzantine church. The altar may belong to Zeus (Fig. 80). Ancient Epitalion was identified on a large plateau to the northwest of the Zoodochou Pigis monastery, near the mouth of the Alpheios. Surface remains consisted primarily of coarsewares, tile and large quantities of Late Classical and Hellenistic sherds. In Ag. Ilias, near the eponymous church, cut limestone blocks, Lakonian roof tiles and some Classical fineware sherds were discovered. According to the surveyors, 'This may be the site of Pyrgos, the southernmost polis in Triphylia, to which the Temple of Athena at Prasidaki likely belonged as an extra-urban sanctuary'. Finally, evidence suggests that Samikon was a Hellenistic foundation of the Triphylian League. Geological cores were drilled to determine the site of its ancient harbour and to identify whether the Kleidhi hills were islands in antiquity. Results suggest that this area cannot have been the town harbour. The 1:1,000 city plans of Samikon, Platiana and Vrestos made in 2009 were supplemented with additional detailed studies at 1:50, primarily of fortifications (Fig. 81). This superficially disparate series of observations relating to the Triphylia provides some interesting infor- mation when viewed en masse. The increasing autonomy from Elis and the foundation of the Triphylian League in the Classical period corresponded to an extension of settlement in the region. Increasing regional insecurity under the Arcadian League (which absorbed the Triphylian League in the fourth century) led to a programme of forti- fication repair and renewal, as demonstrated by the detailed city plans. The diachronic contextualization of Triphylian archaeology shows a region with its own religious and community identity continuously subsumed into larger political units. Related to this is the way in which cultural memory frames activity, as at Kanakia (on the southwest of the island of Salamis), where the perceived epic past framed contemporary Classical practice. To speak of the Archaic and Classical periods is to compartmentalize behaviours that drew on a rich seam of historical knowledge and community memory. It is a standard topos amongst both ancient and modern sources that the past frames the present: for post-Classical Greece, the Classical period is the referent. Indeed, it helped shape the entire cultural movement of the Second Sophistic. What is interesting is to see similar notions at play in the Classical period itself. At Kanakia, an acropolis with Mycenaean habitation with an associated cemetery on a plateau to the southwest has been the focus of study since 2004. The team (as reported by Y. Lolos [Ioannina]) has been excavating a Classical/Hellenistic temenos on this plateau since 2008. The temenos is composed of two levels, bridged by a ramp 80.

To the west, a bothros probably received liquid offerings. This pit was filled in two events, most likely associated with the destruction and subsequent clean-up of the shrine. Much of the pottery from the 2010 excavation of the bothros and surrounding area appears to be Late Classical to Early Hellenistic, with the most common forms being lekanes, wide-mouthed cooking pots, imported transport amphorae (from Thasos and Mende amongst others), pithoi and beehives. Common shapes in Attic black-glaze are phialae, small bowls, skyphoi, kantharoi, closed shapes as oinochoae and olpae, and lamps. Associated small finds include pyramidal loomweights, various metal utili- tarian objects and 13 coins. The relationship between ceramics and small finds (especially the coins) is especially important for dating the temenos. The bronze coins include Athenian issues of the late fourth and early third centuries. A careful reading of the archaeological data suggests to the excavator that the foundation of the shrine relates to the annexation of Salamis to the Athenian state at the end of the fifth century. Its destruction likely took place in the early third century BC, perhaps in relation to the Chremonidian War (268-263/262 BC), judging by</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 53 ceramic and numismatic evidence. The shrine was apparently intended for hero worship, probably of Ajax (and perhaps also the mythical Kychreas). Alongside epigraphic and literary evidence, the spatial relation- ships of the various periods of the site lend credence to this idea. The Mycenaean ruins on the acropolis are visible from the temenos on the plateau, itself located within an old cemetery with visible Mycenaean elements. The shrine was deliberately placed on the plateau in order to emphasize religious connections with the epic past. In contrast to this, recent work at ancient Troizen, as reported by M. Giannopoulou (26th EPCA), highlights that re-use of pre-existing standing architecture need not have associations with identity and cultural memory. Three new forts of the defensive system of the Classical city were found, one on the hill of Vigliza (southeast of Ano Fanari) and two at the coastal sites of Megali Magoula and Limanakia (both overlooking the sea). The fort at Megali Magoula was built amongst the ruins of the Middle Helladic settlement and incorporated the remains of the prehistoric fortification wall in its own defenses. Hellenistic and Roman The Hellenistic and Roman Peloponnese are best discussed together, partially because of the problems in periodization that have been noted elsewhere in detail (Pemberton [2003]; Stewart [2010]), but also because of the sweeping political changes that occurred during this time. There are many specific points that can be drawn out of the material: continuities in religious practice; extended networks of connection beyond the Peloponnese; refine- ments in our understanding of the inhabited landscape; and the general underlying interpretative strand of 'change'. This change is visible not just in terms of architecture or settlement patterning, but also in the continued illumina- tions of the gaps in archaeological knowledge and the refinement of practice. Such new knowledge it evident in the archaeological field survey at Aigialeia in Achaia. It continued in 2010 in the upper Krios valley, under the direction of A. Pontrandolfo (SAIA/Salerno), Z. Aslamatzidou (Director, 6th EPCA) and A. Rizakis (KERA/EIE). The survey focused on the area between modern Perithori and Seliana, targeting a series of natural and artificial terraces on the right bank of the river Krios, plus portions of the associated mountain slopes (Fig. 82). Prospection revealed scattered, roughly-cut, conglomerate blocks, as well as discernable wall lines, roughly half-way up the northwest slope of the target area. The evidence is suggestive of a system of paths and trackways, connecting the lower valley with the hilltop. Artificial terracing appears to be evident on the south, east and west slopes, and is thought to be associated with the recovered terra- cottas and cut-stones. As the surveyors report, 'archaeo- logical evidence on the upper slopes, ca. 1km from ancient Seliana and on the junction of routes towards Arcadia and the Krathis valley, suggests another pole of activity from the Early Helladic period to Late Antiquity in this part of the territory'. In other words, the continued use of archae- ological field survey emphasizes the multi-nodal nature of the inhabited landscape. The narrative of settlement is continuously being extended beyond the old polis- chora dichotomy to allow for hierarchies of interaction along various networks within territories. Survey projects are also contributing to a deeper understanding of settlement patterning and the spatial organization of the inhabited landscape elsewhere in the Peloponnese. Off the southern coast of Lakonia, the Kythera Island Project (as reported by E. Kiriatzi [BSA] and C. Broodbank [London]) continues to illuminate the settlement history of the island. Importantly, preliminary period distributions for diagnostic sherds have been compiled (see the online database for specifics) and show clear peaks of activity in the Classical and Late Roman periods. The trend is borne out by detailed study of specific sites: surface material from Ag. Georgios (KIP Site 111) supports the data from the Sakellarakis excavations (which are soon to be published). No material securely pre-dates the Classical period, with two-thirds of material being Roman (ca. one-third) or Middle Byzantine (ca. one-third). Study of shoreline scatters highlights the problems inherent in assessing surface material in areas with high levels of surface attrition and alteration. Characteristic of low-density scatters (as opposed to identified 'harbour' sites) are high proportions of amphorae (including relatively large numbers of imports from Africa, the western Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Levant) and decorated bowls. It is suggested (see the online database for more detail) that these may represent cast-off ships' equipment; they certainly highlight the importance of the island for inter-regional trade in the eastern Mediterranean. The wide date-ranges of recovered ceramics at these shoreline sites complicate interpretation, but can poten- tially illuminate changing preferences dependent on small shifts in coastal morphology, ship technology, shipping routes, and local coastal activities and settlement. To the north of Kythera, in the southwest part of Elaphonisos (south of Epidauros Limera), and in the area of ancient Boiai, a collaborative surface survey has been underway since 2008, under the direction of E. Mantzourani (University of Athens) and A. Maltezou (5th EPCA). Three areas were investigated. Area A extends from Viglafia to modern Neapolis, area B covers the south- western part of Elaphonisos, and area T lies south of Neapolis, from Palaiokastro to Koraka. Thus far, 31 sites were located in area A (Early Helladic, Classical, Hellenistic and Late Roman), 12 in area B (Early Helladic, Classical/Hellenistic, Roman and early 20th-century) and 13 in area T (Early Helladic, Archaic/Classical, Hellenistic/Roman and early to mid 20th-century). Large quantities of stone tools (of obsidian, flint and other local stones), pottery of all periods (but chiefly historic times) and Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine tile comprise the surface finds. Structures identified include traces of an ancient road in area B (Fig. 83), remains of settlement walls and graves. One of the most exciting and potentially fruitful aspects of this project is the accompanying underwater geophysical survey, which began in 2010 under the direction of G. Papatheodorou (Patras). This aims to map the geology and geomorphology of the sea-bed in the area of Neapolis, and between Neapolis and Elaphonisos, in order to understand better the coastal palaeotopography and any accompanying material culture. By incorporating underwater and terrestrial survey in one project, morpho- logical changes can be incorporated into archaeological interpretations.</page><page sequence="54">54 DANIEL STEWART 82.

Similar interdisciplinary applications of archaeo- logical science are evidenced at Kouphovouno in Lakonia (northeast of Sparta). Beyond the extensive work carried out in relation to prehistoric deposits, resistance and magnetometer surveys (carried out by M. Boyd, and reported by R. Sweetman [BSA/St Andrews]) sought to illuminate areas of Roman habitation. Several anomalies were detected, including roughly circular burned features and potential kilns. A large wide north-south anomaly may be architectural and appears to be associated with the potential kilns. Weak north-south results may be read as terracing or roads. At ancient Corinth, the urban topography has been refined by studies under the direction of G. Sanders (ASCSA). Soundings made to locate a western inter- section between the decumanus south of the South Stoa and the southern extension (the 'Kenchrean Road') of the car do maximus (the 'Lechaeum Road') confirmed the proposed path of the road illustrated in the Corinth volumes, and prove that the Kenchrean Road did not extend the line of the cardo. A section of colluvium eroded off Acrocorinth was excavated, revealing Late Neolithic, Early Bronze Age and Hellenistic pottery. Dug into the colluvium was a cellar of the Hellenistic period, containing a dumped fill dating to the early third century BC. Another mid third-century fill contained sherds of a kantharos with four lines of an inscription on the interior (Fig. 84). Intriguingly, Sanders reports that 'a preliminary reading identifies on line 1 part of a personal name; line 2, "a crescent-shaped. . . [offering? and]"; line 3 "a plaque to the hero... [and]"; line 4 "fresh frankincense..."'. The excavation of the colluvium is important for establishing the impact of erosion on artefact recovery upslope. At the Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia, R. Senff (DAI) directed architectural and environmental studies. The integration of interdisciplinary research methods is proving particularly fruitful here. Erosion and flood have always had an impact on the topography of the sanctuary, and efforts were made to shed light on the sedimentary history through systematic coring and geoelectric profiling by sampling the area southwest of the sanctuary by the ancient Kladeos shore wall, to the west of the modern Kladeos river-bed and in the Alpheios plain. 84. Ancient Corinth: inscribed kantharos. © ASCSA. The so-called South Stoa was also a focus for study. The stoa, built in the mid fourth century BC and repaired during the Early to Middle Roman period, lies at the southern edge of the old excavations, conducted between 1875 and 1881, and again in 1937/1938 and 1938/1939. In 2010, a stone-by-stone plan was made at a scale of 1:50 (Fig. 85). Trials on the efficacy and economy of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) were also conducted (Fig. 86). Work at Olympia continues to highlight the balance between excavation, restoration, consolidation and archival research in understanding the diachronic history of the site. Southeast of ancient Corinth and south of Isthmia, J. Rife (ASCSA) supervised the study of ceramics from tomb 22 on the Koutsongila ridge at Kenchreai. Most of these ceramics are Early to Middle Roman, and relate to the primary phase of burial. A few finds, however, date to a secondary phase of temporary occupation during the Middle Byzantine period (10th-12th century AD). What emerges from this are the material traces of the disjuncture between ancient funerary spaces and the lived experience of subsequent inhabitants. What had been the respected tombs of local inhabitants become the foci of habitation in later centuries. Continued work at ancient Troizen relating to Classical, Hellenistic and Roman burials may also help to illuminate social relationships and funerary ritual through time. Groups of Classical, Hellenistic and Roman tombs were excavated in both the west and east cemeteries. Most of the graves were oriented east-west and are predomi- nantly limestone cists with some tile graves. Sarcophagi are rare in all periods. In general, there is a relatively high quantity of bronze items in graves of the Classical period, suggesting to M. Giannopoulou (26th EPCA) the existence of local metalworkers' shops (a hypothesis strengthened by a large amount of bronze from foundry activity discovered in the Asklepieion area). By contrast, pottery was generally rare, but did include imports from Attica and Corinth. Elsewhere at the site, the location of the theatre has been identified thanks to the discovery of a Corinthian capital decorated with a theatrical mask, below the Temple of Aphrodite Akraia near the eastern fortification wall.</page><page sequence="56">56 DANIEL STEWART 85. Olympia, South Stoa: preliminary plan. © DAI. Continuities are in evidence in many sites examined in 2010. Classical and Hellenistic shrines see elaboration in the Roman period; and while continuities of cult may be in evidence, continuities of practice may not be. Extensive archaeological work in Argos, with the focus of study by Anne Pariente (Lyon/EfA) and Christos Piteros (4th EPCA) being the Nannopoulos plot, highlights this. Previous reports ( AR 52 [2005-2006] 29-31; 53 [2006-2007] 18-19; 54 [2007-2008] 27) have focused on the excavation of Byzantine graves in the abandoned agora and the excavation of a monumental exedra that fell out of use in the sixth and seventh centuries AD. Study of the exedra's orchestra fill identified fragments of architectural elements dating to the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In conjunction with the previously reported ceramic data of 2006, this is suggestive of a gradual transformation of this area of the public agora into a primarily religious space, with the abandonment of some structures and the modification of others into early churches and associated out-buildings from the third to sixth century AD. At Tegea in Arcadia, excavation continued west of the theatre at Palaia Episkopi, as reported by A.-V. Karapanagiotou (39th EPCA), D. Athanasoulis (25th EBA) and K. 0degard (Norwegian Institute at Athens). The majority of the recovered archaeology dates to the Byzantine period, but the associations between the later and earlier phases were clarified. The concrete floor reported in 2009 and associated with a Byzantine wine- press was explored further, and is suggested to date to the Hellenistic period. Excavations to the east uncovered a first-century BC floor; finds included pieces of charcoal and several whole vessels, including a Megarian bowl and terra sigillata, but nothing post-Hellenistic. A trial trench (5 x 10m) opened in the north of the study area revealed evidence of probable industrial activity, namely many cuts and fills and remains of charcoal and clayey silt. This may be associated with the production of tiles or pottery. Most of the pottery from this area is Roman, including several Corinthian lamp fragments of the second to third century AD. The relationships are unclear, but do seem to suggest that industrial, religious and domestic activities co-existed within a relatively small area. 86. Olympia, South Stoa: detail of the scatter plot created by TLS scan. View from the east of the protruding central south fagade. © DAI. West of Tegea, at Arachamitai (north of Asea) the Finnish Institute at Athens, under B. Forsen, continued its excavations at Ag. Paraskevi. A magnetometer survey and trial trenches located a 30 x 11m Late Hellenistic building (Fig. 87) and another 65 x 65m square structure with a central courtyard. The 30 x 11m building is connected to a sacred deposit and a sanctuary of the Late Archaic to the Late Hellenistic period. The courtyard structure, of uncertain function, dates to the third or fourth century AD. A new five-year programme of excavation was begun in 2010, focusing on the 30 x 11m building and its surroundings, which appear to be primarily religious in nature. The project presents a tantalizing opportunity to trace the shifting nature of religious practice through archi- tectural changes. The courtyard of the Roman structure was accessed from the west along a ca. 15m-wide passage flanked by rows of small square rooms. It was previously reported (AT? 54 [2007-2008] 32) that part of the northern flank of this passage was built on top of the Late Hellenistic building. Trial excavations in one of the square rooms indicate that the superstructure was likely quite light and only one storey.</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 57 87. Arachamitai: plan of the 30 x 11m building overlaid on the magnetometer map. © Finnish Institute at Athens (B. Forsen). The walls of the Late Hellenistic 30 x 11m building were traced, revealing outer walls 0.5-0.6m thick and composed of head-size stones with dirt fill. Parts of the foundation and socle survive, though the upper courses, probably of mud-brick, are now lost. The thickness of the walls and strong foundations suggest a two-storey structure. The pottery and other finds recovered inside the building mainly date to the second to first century BC, and the evidence suggests two building phases. Three rooms within were partially excavated, revealing a collapsed roof of Lakonian roof tiles. In Room I, a tile mosaic was discovered below the tile collapse. The room's function is unclear, though it appears to date to the later construction phase of the building. It drains to the west (through Room III) via an open pipe, and the only significant artefact was a Late Hellenistic lamp. Excavations in Room II suggest a storage room, revealing three floor levels - two of packed earth and one paved with re-used tile - and large amounts of pottery (storage and tablewares) and other finds (including multi-coloured millefiore glass, two coins and fragmentary female figurines). Fragments of similar figurines were found outside the building, on the south side. The large rectangular Room III, in the west end of the building, had a floor of packed earth. It contained seven coins and large amounts of pottery that indicate it may have been used for communal eating and drinking. Evidence of earlier activity pre-dating the building was recovered below the floor in this room, with fourth- and third-century BC black-glazed pottery decorated with ribbing and grooves. Other finds include a handle of a bronze mirror, whose closest parallels are the Caryatid mirrors of the Sikyon school (Fig. 88). Scattered architectural fragments dating to the Archaic period, including part of a painted sima, suggest this building was perhaps a temple. Further indication of cult activity and its continuation at the site is given by tile stamps evident in the roof collapse: stamps bearing fragmentary APTEM... and AE2T7... and TTOINA... strengthen the assumption that the roof-tile stamps give the genitive form of the goddesses worshipped at the site, Artemis and Despoina. Further to the west, the work of M. Petropoulos (Director emeritus, 39th EPCA), D. Romano (Pennsylvania) and M. Voyatzis (Arizona) continued at the Sanctuary of Zeus at Mount Lykaion (on the modern-day mountain of Ag. Ilias). The upper sanctuary altar deposits continue to shed light on religious practice, and there is evidence of an almost continuous sequence of activity (pottery and burnt debris) from the Late Neolithic through to the Hellenistic period: the earlier excavations of Leonardos ( AE [1898] 248-72) and Kourouniotes ( Praktika [1903] 50-52; AE [1904] 153-214; PAE [1909] 185-200) had only suggested activity beginning in the Late Geometric period, so this is a significant discovery. While the nature of votives changed over time, the persistence of the dedicatory activity speaks to the long-standing importance of the sanctuary for the region. The previously reported work of Y. Pikoulas (Thessaly) (AR 53 [2006-2007] 24; 54 [2007-2008] 32-33; 55 [2008-2009] 27) on the roads and trackways of the sanctuary environs seems to corroborate this (Fig. 89). Continuities in religious focus are also evident in the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia, in the Corinthia, though these continuities occur in previously unsuspected areas of the sanctuary. T. Gregory (Ohio State) reports on the area north of the sanctuary, where conservation of the mosaics in the Roman Bath continued. Investigation of a large Early Roman complex north of the bath also continued - as reported in 2009, its walls appear to rest on Classical foundations. Various artefacts - stamped roof tiles, antefixes, sima fragments - found north of the Roman bath, in the Hexamilion Outworks, in Tower 14 of the Byzantine fortress and on the Theatre Terrace (Figs. 90, 91) suggest the possibility of a rectangular courtyard or complex joining these areas of the sanctuary and providing a previously unknown centre of activity at Isthmia. 88.

Arapogianni (AS A/Director, 38th EPCA) at ancient Thouria in Messenia provide information about local religious activity and cult practice, and by extension, local community identities. Building l~, partially excavated in 2009, was further delimited, exposing the entrance on the south side, with part of the characteristically Peloponnesian ramp preserved. In the northwest corner, an in situ 'treasure-receptacle' was discovered. This is a square block with a rounded hollow in the centre, surrounded by a sill to support a metal cover. An inscription on the upper face of the 'receptacle' dates to the late fourth or early third century BC: 'Etti iepoQirrav E7roir|0r| 'Ayia, 'ApikAeiSccs, 5aiaioupycov ©ico- vos, 'AXKavBpou, KaXAiKpaTrjs. apxiTEKTcov ©eoBcopog In 2009, remains of a marble offering table were found in the same area. The excavator suggests that this indicates that the building is a temple and the work of the architect Theodoros. It certainly highlights the broader networks to which religious sites could and did belong. Hints of these networks can also be seen in the rescue excavations of various Ephoreia staff. At Aloni Boliari (near modern Platiana, south of Olympia), the acropolis slopes were examined by G. Hatzi (Director, 7th EPCA). On the east slope a probably public, temple-like structure with few finds was identified, while on the southwest slope a monumental Hellenistic (fourth- to third-century) tomb was examined. Finds included a composite female statue with a marble head set onto a soft limestone body. Further south, close to the administrative border with Messenia, at Perivolia (near modern Phigaleia) excavations continue on a sanctuary of an as-yet-unknown deity. Within the temple, the base of the cult statue was exposed. The altar and offering table with lion-paw feet were restored by Ephoreia conservators on the model of fourth- to third- century examples of Arcadian derivation as at Alipheira and the Temples of Athena and Zeus Sotiras at Phigaleia. Similar work carried out by P. Themelis (ASA) at Ithome (in Messenia) elucidates cult activity at the Temple of Eileithyia. On the south slope of Ithome, northwest of the Temple of Artemis Limnatis, the remains of a tetrastyle prostyle Ionic temple were investigated, and the remains of a marble cult statue recovered. While details are scarce, work of this nature has the potential to further extend our understanding of the rich religious life of the area. The close associations between religion and local identity are especially important for Messenia, post-Leuctra. North of Tegea, near Mantineia at Milia, a child burial in a marble sarcophagus was recovered by A. Karapanagiotou (39th EPCA) in a known ancient cemetery. The Hellenistic and Roman finds include the first gold found in this cemetery, but more interesting are the hints of funerary rites associated with elite juveniles. Urban topography continued to be refined at several sites in the Peloponnese. At Messene (in Messenia), excavations by P. Themelis (ASA) continued in the theatre and in the east of the agora, further improving under- standing of the building sequence in this area. At a tomb east of the bouleion, fragments of a stele were discovered outlining a third-century alliance between Messene and five Cretan cities (the poleis of the Apteraioi, the Eleuthernaioi, the Sibrytioi and the Anopolitai, with the fifth perhaps being Phalasarna). Within the city of Sparta, in Lakonia, rescue excavation continues to be the primary source of topographic information (Fig. 92). On the property of Vr. Leopoulou (O.T. 127), a road was discovered leading to the acropolis, likely part of the dense Late Roman road network already documented in this area. An associated kiln site pre-dates the road, dating to the third to early fourth century AD. On the property of A. Rigou (O.T. 127), the remains of a Roman to Byzantine orthogonal building were discovered during excavations in 2008-2009, which may be associated with a recovered Middle Byzantine church and olive press (see Late Roman and Byzantine Greece). During rescue excavations on the property of N. Panoutsakou (O.T. 127), several architec- tural features were recorded, including walls forming an orthogonal building with a doorway, and water channels, tombs, a floor mosaic, a silo and a mortar floor. The western part of the plot had successive building phases of the Roman and Late Roman periods. The water channels seem to continue into the neighbouring property of G. Kalopisi (O.T. 127). The continued presence of both domestic and industrial structures in an area outside the Late Roman defences is particularly interesting. Perhaps most significantly, continued research touching on specifically Hellenistic and Roman questions is further undermining the old topos of the depopulated, culturally insignificant and economically isolated Peloponnese. Many of the sites discussed above highlight this re-evaluation, but it is vitally important to acknowledge the extensive contributions made by the staff of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in this area. Not only have they continued to work under difficult circum- stances, but their efforts lie at the forefront of more careful readings of the archaeology of the Peloponnese. For example, in modern Amaliada, northwest of Olympia, in the courtyard of the Monastery of Ag. Athanasios (Kouroutas), extensive Roman settlement remains were discovered, including a probable Roman bath complex. This agrees with more recent readings of the western Peloponnese that see it as a focus for Early Roman habitation and an important node in connecting south Italy with the Greek mainland. Worth flagging up separately are the important discus- sions for a proposed Parrhasian Heritage Park of the Peloponnesos that are underway - this would be the first large-scale heritage park in Greece, and would protect and unify aspects of Arcadia, Elis and Messenia (see http://parrhasianheritagepark.org). M. Petropoulos (Director emeritus, 39th EPCA), D. Romano (Pennsylvania) and M. Voyatzis (Arizona) of the Mount Lykalon Project are leading discussions, and should be congratulated for spearheading such an important venture. Key trends The regional overview provides insight into several broader trends evident within the archaeological work conducted in the Peloponnese in 2010. These trends will undoubtedly help shape interpretation and further research in the years to come. It is hoped that it will be useful to lay these out here as a foundation for future discussion in subsequent editions of AG. Any discussion of the Peloponnese from the Archaic to Roman period is immediately faced with several signif- icant problems. Any such review, drawn from recent preliminary reports of archaeological work, is necessarily</page><page sequence="60">60 DANIEL STEWART 92. Sparta: property divisions within modern Sparta. © BSA.

But it is selective not only in terms of what sites to include, but also in terms of overall organization. A chronological focus masks the sometimes quite marked differences between regions in the Peloponnese, and period divisions are sometimes only generally defined in the available literature. Historic periods especially tend to 'bleed into' one another, and the continued (but unavoidable) reliance on diagnostic pottery from major production centres for dating only exacerbates the issue. Moreover, the sheer volume of reported work can make it difficult to synthesize and contextualize the preliminary reports adequately - interpretations should be read as tentative. Be that as it may, the archaeological reports can be broadly separated into continuing trends and emerging trends, some of which have been alluded to already. Amongst the continuing trends are aspects of archaeo- logical practice. Rescue and salvage excavation has always played a prominent role in the activities of the Ministry but there has been a recent push amongst staff to make the results of such excavations more widely available. This is evident not only in the more detailed reports available in the ADelt, but also in the widening participation of Ephoreia staff in multilingual publications (for example, Cavanagh et al. [2009]). Surface survey remains a consistent and widely- practised methodology in the Peloponnese, with several projects either being directed or co-directed by Greek staff. Gone are the days when survey was seen simply as a tool for archaeological prospection, an attitude that persisted in some quarters of the archaeological establishment well into the new millennium. Developments and refinements to technique are evident in several of the projects noted above: the Kythera Island Project's near total coverage of the island and intensive methodology is providing quite nuanced readings of the landscape over time, and the activity of A. Rizakis (in the Aigialeia) continues to set the agenda for our understanding of Roman Achaia. Indeed, Rizakis' extensive publication activities (Rizakis and Leponioti [2010]; and the forthcoming proceedings of the conference on Villae Rusticae) represent significant contri- butions to our understanding of the Roman Peloponnese. The recent publication of the intensive survey of Mastos, in the Berbati valley helps fill in the archaeological gaps in the Argolid (Lindblom and Wells [2011]). In a similar vein, surface survey's inherent interdisci- plinarity is still in evidence. The incorporation of micro- stratigraphy, ceramic petrography and fabric analyses, and geophysical research is complementing and refining data derived from field-walking. The relationship between surface and sub-surface archaeology remains a thorny issue, but continued use of a wide-ranging and multi- farious archaeological toolkit is the surest way to under- standing the complexities of that relationship. Much of the archaeological work is still carried out by large foreign schools on the sites carved out in the 19th century or on ancillary offshoots. The research focus on urban sites and the religious topography of major sanctu- aries continues to be justified by the nature of discoveries in 2010. The focus of the American School on the Corinthia is providing a rich seam of archaeological data relating to several poleis and sanctuaries through time. The strong time-depth of these excavations provides vital data for sequencing, as well as important contextual infor- mation for neighbouring regions. Isthmia and Kenchreai highlight the subtle readings of religious practice that are possible from such consistent regional research. Similarly, such long-standing topographic concentra- tions allow for a greater understanding in habitation sequences and a greater subtlety in the reading of occupation histories. The re-use of architecture and related material between periods is now seen to have connotations denoting the development and expression of notions of cultural memory. In other words, not every example of re-use is simply pragmatic - they can be read as well as assertions of shared links with the past or a wish to emphasize particular religious associations, as at the potential shrine to Ajax at Kanakia on Salamis. Other expressions of community identity can perhaps be seen in the foundational activities in the Triphyiia and the liminal sanctuaries noted by the associated survey project. The recent publication by Whitmarsh (2010) draws together similar themes of community memory and cultural identity in relation to Roman Greece. Closely related to this are the restoration projects at Olympia, Nemea, and Messene. Careful contextualized restoration and consolidation are now key aspects of projects that used to be defined pejoratively as 'big digs'. It is important to note the debate between restoration and conservation - they are not synonymous terms. Restoration, as a practice, is not without its detractors - each column of the Temple of Zeus at Nemea that is re- erected and refluted serves to punctuate that debate. Restoration helps to emphasize for the public how sites and monuments sat in the landscape, but it also reifies contemporary interpretation. Emerging trends visible within recent archaeological work largely focus on issues of interpretation. Whereas the focus on the archaeology of religious activity is a continuing trend, the way in which much of the material is being read is certainly quite new. Refinements of archae- ological techniques are highlighting the variable foci of activity within sanctuaries - as at Mount Lykaion and Isthmia. Moreover, the totality of the religious culture of the inhabited landscape is now very much in evidence: the documentation of regional sanctuaries, local cemeteries (with their evidence of community funerary ritual) and associated access routes across broader landscapes means that individual sites are no longer read in isolation, but as part of larger cultic networks reflective of past belief and practice. A similar perspective can be seen in the identification of non-standard urban topographies. The various urban surveys now in operation, coupled with systematic targeted excavation, are helping to refine the ways we read ancient urban centres. The rigid schema of the 1980s and 1990s are giving way to much more organic readings of urban plans. Continued study is also likely to illuminate the relationship(s) between poleis and their subordinate towns and villages, and their supporting economies. Many of these emerging trends have, at their heart, a more contextualized or holistic methodology. The incor- poration of faunal studies and microstratigraphy at Isthmia, the geophysical research at Olympia, Kouphovouno and Arachamitai, and the complementary terrestrial and underwater surveys at the Saronic Habours Project and south of Epidauros Limera in the area of ancient Boiai all speak to this.</page><page sequence="62">62 DANIEL STEWART Perhaps the most interesting development in the archaeology of the Peloponnese is the blurring of distinc- tions between the various archaeological cultures of researchers at work in the region. The various foreign schools and the Greek archaeological services used to exhibit much more recognizably different approaches, both in terms of the method and theory that drove archae- ological practice and in the subsequent interpretations. While it is certainly possible to see differences in research focus amongst the various projects discussed in this volume, methodological differences are harder to pin- point on the basis of nationality. Questions of religious practice and belief are no longer studied simply through temple architecture or excavation. Regional economies are not only elucidated through the placement of 'dots on maps'. Urban topography is no longer simply proving or disproving Pausanias. Continued dialogue amongst active archaeologists is creating a shared pool of knowledge that is shaping the practice of archaeology in the Peloponnese. The best illustration of this lies in the many new publi- cations relating to the archaeology of the Peloponnese. The lifting of the archaeological gaze is evident in several interpretative studies. The collection of essays offered to Madeleine Jost (Carlier and Lerouge-Cohen [2010]) examines the archaeological history of religion and the landscape in a contextualized manner. The essays examine the impact of recent archaeological work on the religious landscape of Arcadia and tie archaeological under- standings to careful readings of Pausanias - still the most influential primary source on Greek religion. The comparative approach lies behind a new volume edited by Friesen, Schowalter and Walters (2010) that examines the religious life of the Hellenistic and Roman Corinthia. Much of the work presented in the volume is inherently interdisciplinary, with art-historical, numis- matic, epigraphical, literary and archaeological sources woven together to assess the depth of religious life in the area, with case-studies examining aspects of Isthmia and Kenchreai, as well as specific cults such as those of Demeter, Asklepios or the Sacred Spring. The study of the terracottas of Elis also shows similar interpretative trends. The new publication by Froning and Zimmermann-Elseify (2010) not only publishes the figurines excavated in the 1960s and 1970s for the first time, but contextualizes them in light of networks of inter- action stretching across the northern Peloponnese. The vast majority of the terracottas are of local production, and in design, technology and quality have demonstrable links with excavated examples from Olympia. More surprising is the potential link with terracotta workshops at Corinth, especially amongst fifth- and fourth-century examples. The recent publication of the terracottas from the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Corinth (Bookidis [2010]) will undoubtedly facilitate more explicit comparisons. This brief review cannot hope to do justice to the full range of publications, emerging and continuing trends or the richness of the archaeological data produced by the projects discussed. There can be no denying that Greek archaeology (and archaeologists of Greece) face signif- icant challenges in the coming years; perhaps the perceived emphasis on interdisciplinarity will translate into a new wave of collaborative projects that seek to maximize diminishing resources.

He will be sorely missed by Cretan archae- ologists, especially those involved in the Minoan period, particularly for his excavations in and around the town of Archanes, in the Idaean cave, at the Minoan-style peak sanctuary on Kythera and those he had resumed in 2004 at Zominthos, whose 2010 season is noted below. These discoveries form part of his great legacy to our field. On the other hand, Professor Peter Warren is thankfully very much with us and his contribution to Minoan archaeology was marked by the presentation of a volume, Cretan Offerings , containing 36 chapters that reflect his broad academic interests ranging in period from Early Minoan to LMIIIC, and on topics that include rural landscape, Minoan religion, plants and chronology (Krzyszkowska 2010). This is a relatively slim year for reports on new activity on Crete. Last year's AG included summaries not only of ADelt 55, covering activity up to 2000, but also of the proceedings of the first conference on Archaeological Work in Crete (see AR 56 [2009-2010] 169). Together these contributed to a list comprising over 100 sites reported last year. This year only 25 sites are listed, although some of these comprise activity within more than one area. The reduction is likely to be temporary; the next volume of ADelt (trailed in AR 56 [2009-2010] 1) is in press, but not yet available at the time of writing. In addition, a second meeting on Archaeological Work in Crete was held in Autumn 2010 and its publication too will feed into AG in due course, while in March 2011 in Heidelberg the conference Minoan Archaeology: Challenges and Perspectives for the 21st Century empha- sized the future of the field. In October 2011 the 11th International Cretological Congress will be held in Rethymnon. This year's regional summary represents only a small sample of the overall activity that took place in 2010; in particular, it under-represents the huge amount of work undertaken by archaeologists employed by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism whose reports will soon be available in the publications cited above. It is based mostly on reports directly submitted by the teams in charge of work, augmented by mentions of relevant publications that have appeared since the last AG. Palaeolithic/Mesolithic In many ways, Crete, the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean, is a microcosm for the archaeology of Greece, displaying many qualities of a small mainland. However, it has been an island for hundreds of thousands of years, and its insularity explained the lack of a documented pre-Neolithic human presence, despite occasional claims to the contrary and the discovery of a pre-Neolithic human presence on the island of Cyprus. Discoveries in 2008 almost certainly altered this picture with the identification through survey of Mesolithic (ca. 11,000-9,000 BP) and probable Lower Palaeolithic (ca. 130,000 BP) artefacts at a number of locations in the Plakias region of west-central Crete. Even at these early dates, Crete was separated by sea from nearby mainlands, raising the possibility that human sea travel took place much earlier than previously thought. The material has been debated since those initial announcements, but a first detailed publication of the evidence has now appeared (Strasser et al. [2010]; see also Strasser [2010], the latter piece referring to planned excavation at one of the Mesolithic sites). The earliest prehistory of Crete may well be rewritten and these results should also be compared with earlier discoveries on the island of Gavdos, south of Crete, briefly presented in 2009 (Kopaka and Matzanas [2009]). Prepalatial (Early Minoan to MMIA) Prior to the discoveries above, the earliest securely documented human presence on Crete was the earliest Neolithic occupation at Knossos. Although research continues on systematic restudy for publication of the Neolithic material from Knossos Kephala, there are no further reports on the Neolithic period for any sites on Crete in 2010-2011. However, the millennium preceding the appearance of the Minoan palaces, the Prepalatial period, offers both new publications and new discoveries. The results of combined excavation and survey of the two Early Minoan to Middle Minoan tholos tombs at Moni Odigitria (cf AR 50 [2003-2004] 82; 51 [2004-2005] 114-15) have now been published (Vasilakis and Branigan [2010]), allowing not only a detailed understanding of the tombs themselves and their contents (including high- quality osteological analyses), but also an overview of the long-term history of the Upper Ayiopharango catchment to set alongside results of the 1970s survey of the Lower Ayiopharango (Blackman and Branigan 1975; 1977). This publication joins the detailed publications of two of the tholos tombs at Archanes Phournoi (Panagiotopoulos [2002] Tholos E; Papadatos [2005] Tholos T) and the more recent discovery at Livari Skiadi, as well as the ongoing work on burial structures at Petras Kephala and at Sisi Kephali tou Agiou Antoniou/Boupho (below). In addition to this publication of a specific site, there have been publications of petrographic analyses of ceramics in Early Minoan west Crete (Nodarou 2011) and from the site of Aphroditis Kephala, near Vasiliki in eastern Crete (Nodarou 2010). New material of the very beginning of the Bronze Age (Final Neolithic/EMI) has been identified in a fourth season of excavation at Priniatikos Pyrgos, according to B. Molloy (Dublin), B. Hayden (Pennsylvania Museum), J. Day (Dublin) and V. Kontza-Jaklova (Pennsylvania Museum), where, in addition to finds of many other periods (Middle and Late Minoan, Geometric, Classical, Byzantine) in the general area of Trench II (Fig. 93) a small EMI domestic area was uncovered (Fig. 94). Also revealed were Final Neolithic/ EMI-II obsidian fragments, including flakes, rejuvenated cores and debitage, suggesting working in situ (Fig. 95). The presence of obsidian may suggest a similarity with other north-coastal Minoan sites with Cycladic materials and/or artefacts, such as Herakleion Poros, Ag. Photia or Chrysokamino. Obsidian was also found, along with ceramics, in EMII material from soundings carried out in spaces 2, 3, 10 and 19 within Building T7 of Quartier A at Malia, in the course of excavations resumed in 2010 after a study season and reported by M Pomadere (EfA/Picardie) (Fig. 96).

Soles (ASCSA/North Carolina) and C. Davaras (Athens) report on a second season of resumed excavation of the island settlement of Mochlos in 2010 that revealed the site's earliest known structures in the form of a building complex, occupied in EMI and IIA-B, on the east edge of the Prepalatial cemetery, and apparently housing an obsidian workshop in its early phase (Fig. 97). Excavations in Areas 3 and 4 of the site, as a whole targeted on recovering its earlier phases of occupation, revealed a fairly wide distribution of EMU material, suggesting an overall size for the settlement in this period of 0.6ha (see also Soles and Davaras [2010]). 95. Priniatikos Pyrgos: Early Minoan obsidian. © IIHSA. New burials spanning the EMII-MMIIA period continued to turn up in 2010 in the fourth season of excavations at the coastal site of Sisi Kephali tou Agiou Antoniou/Boupho (Fig. 98), as reported by J. Driessen (Belgian School/UC Lou vain) and I. Schoep (Belgian School/KU Leuven). To date, the remains of at least 81 individuals have been recovered in the cemetery area defined as zone 1 and the condition of the skeletal material suggests frequent, regular human activity within the cemetery. Excavation of a further funerary structure (Building 1.19; Fig. 99) now implies that the cemetery of built house-tombs may extend all the way around the lower terrace that marks the northern edge of the site. A report by Rena Veropoulidou (Thessaloniki/ Ministry of Culture and Tourism) on shells from the EMU site of Trypiti on the coast south of the Asterousia range indicates a total assemblage of ca. 4,500 items, mostly from middens and food preparation areas, and predomi- nantly of species that were locally available. The total assemblage exceeds that collected from much larger coastal or near-coastal sites (Kommos, Palaikastro and Knossos) and is 20 times greater than that from the site of Myrtos Phournou Koriphi, comparable both in size and date. The size of the assemblage reflects improvements in recovery techniques applied in modern excavations and demonstrates the potential for bioarchaeological analyses to enhance our understanding of ancient diet.

Protopalatial (MMIB) circuit wall were uncovered immediately north of the town and, slightly further north, outside the town area, a small two-roomed structure dated to LMIB that contained storage vessels (one with a Linear A inscription) and may have been used for the storage of food and liquids (wine and/or wine). Survey and further excavation at this site with a long history of investigation are combining to reveal a coastal settlement with some similarities to those at Kommos and Herakleion Poros. On a smaller scale the excavations in Quartier A at Malia, referred to above, are further elucidating urban organi- zation, including the layout of streets, in this part of the extensive Minoan town west of the Palace and southeast of Quartier M. Notable is the recovery from a pit of early Protopalatial (MMIB-IIB) fineware ceramics and bone/shell assemblages, while continued excavation in Room 17 (Fig. 96) of an MMIIB destruction level uncovered prestige objects, such as a bronze dagger (Fig. 101) and indications of administrative activity (three prismatic seals, a nodule and fragments of a possible clay bar with seal impressions). The deposit shows similarities in function to Quartier M, suggesting another contem- porary focus of elite activity, including administration, within this part of the settlement in the Protopalatial period. In addition to the remains of earlier settlement mentioned above, excavation at Mochlos in 2010 also elucidated the Neopalatial phases of the site, revealing a stone-vessel workshop belonging to LMIB in Area 2 and the town's main street in Area 3 (Fig. 102). However, in the remains of a wall that collapsed in LMIB in Area 4, one of those objects that cannot fail to grab our imagi- 100. Gournia: trench plan, 2010. © ASCSA 101.

The lid (Fig. 103), although missing its top-right section, shows a scene with parallels in seal iconography that the excavator, J. Soles, has suggested might possibly depict a coronation, a reading that invites comparison with interpretations of Augustan Roman imagery, notably the Gemma Augustaea (see his presentation at the ASCSA annual open meeting at: http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/news/newsDetails/ videocast-open-meeting-201 1/). Finally, the late Y. Sakellarakis (ASA) reported on a seventh season of excavations at the site of Zominthos that lies on a small upland plain high in the Psiloritis (Ida) massif south of the town of Anogeia on a probable route to the Idaean cave. Work continued on the main Middle Minoan to Late Minoan complex, which includes some well-preserved architecture, including interior windows (Fig. 104). The location was also occupied in the Classical, Hellenistic and Roman, as well as the Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman periods, and these later phases are also reflected in the Venetian and later cheese dairies and manufacturing facilities in its immediate vicinity. Near one of these, at the location Ta Mnemata only ca. 200m distant from the Minoan complex, are remains of a two-room Mycenaean (LMIIIA2-B) structure, while not too far distant from Zominthos itself is the site of Kouroupetos, where a second season of excavation was carried out in 2010 at a LMIIIA2 burial cave. Sakellarakis also carried out cleaning in the Bronze Age and later Idaean cave sanctuary, some kilometres to the south of Zominthos, cleaning areas below the adyton and revealing fragments of bronze, gold, ivory and ceramics of many periods. One of his last large-scale publications, together with his wife, is a presentation of the cave and its material (Sakellarakis and Sapouna- Sakellaraki [2011]). Final (LMII-IIIA2) and Postpalatial (LMIIIA2-B) The term 'Final' is used to define the period when the palace at Knossos was functioning, with its Linear B administration, prior to its destruction within the LMIIIA2 period. Three newly published studies draw on the Linear B documents from Knossos to explore this period. Petrakis's Athens PhD thesis examines the economic organization and political geography of LMIII Crete through a detailed analysis of the inscribed stirrup jars bearing the term wa-na-ka-te-ro (Petrakis [2010]), while Greco seeks to elucidate the management of sheep rearing by Knossos (Greco [2010]). Slightly broader in its remit, in that it also examines Postpalatial Crete and draws in comparisons from the mainland, is Privitera's study of centralized storage in the 15th- 13th century BC (Privitera 2010). Finally, in addition, there is a new study of the 'warrior grave' phenomenon at Knossos in the 15th- 14th century (Miller [2011]). Returning to Sisi, the architectural complex CD in zones 3 and 4 (Fig. 105) excavated on the summit of the Kephali tou Agiou Antoniou/Boupho hill and explored further in 2010 is unusual in the LMIIIB period, when it went out of use, both for its size and for its elaboration, including a large columnar hall. It may well have been the only substantial structure on the site at the time, since Building F, in zone 6 to the southeast (Fig. 98), had appar- ently been destroyed in the LMIIIA2 phase. This pattern of a single large building complex at a coastal site in LMIIIB may resemble that in Quartier N at Malia a few kilometres west along the coast ( cf Driessen in Cline [2010] 566-67). 103.

Spanning most of this period is the extensive cemetery excavated in 2003-2005 at 73-77 Igoumenou Gabriel Street in Chania reported by M. Andreadaki- Vlazaki (Secretary General of Antiquities, Ministry of Culture and Tourism/Director, 25th EPCA) and E. Protopapadaki (25th EPCA). The 60 excavated tombs extend over an area of almost 0.2ha and the Bronze Age examples include 32 pit caves, one of which (Tomb 40) is the earliest and largest in the cemetery and dates to LMII, six shaft graves and a group of 15 chamber tombs in the northern part of the site. The tombs contain the offerings one would expect from high-status burials of this period: extensive decorated fineware ceramics, bronze swords, spearheads and daggers and sealstones. In addition, the skeletal remains have been analysed to determine sex and age, and to assess health. The burial types resemble those of Final Palatial Knossos and further underline the impor- tance of Chania, the only site other than Knossos to reveal a Linear B tablet archive in this period, possibly a successor to that based at Knossos until LMIIIA2. (For a more detailed description, see Andreadaki-Vlazaki and Protopapadaki [2009]). Further unrobbed Minoan tombs containing ceramics and valuable objects are reported by the 23rd EPCA in the Teke/Ambelokipi region north of Knossos. Iron Age (LMIIIC to Geometric) S. Wallace (BSA) has published a study of the devel- opment of Cretan settlement in the landscape from the 12th to the fifth century (Wallace [2010]). She also reports on a second season of study of material from excavations in 2008 at the LMIIIC to Subminoan site of Karphi and conservation work there. A welcome addition to funerary material from the period is the publication of a group of 16 Protogeometric to Geometric chamber and tholos tombs excavated in 1998 (AR 47 [2000-2001] 130-31) close to modern Kounavoi (ancient Eltyn(i)a) (Rethemiotakis and Englezou [2010]). 106.

Stampolidis (Crete/Museum of Cycladic Art), the 26th season of work at the site. Both were chamber tombs. The first ( ca . 700-650 BC) contained the remains of four females, one probably in her late 60s, the others much younger; the second (ca. 680-600 BC) contained only two skeletons, a female in her 20s and a young man in his late teens. Both were elite tombs with metal vessels and gold jewellery; the woman in the second tomb had been covered with a white wool or linen cloth onto which were sewn gold decorations. Of roughly similar date is the Prophitis Ilias settlement that lies on a hill approximately 1km east of the acropolis of Gortyn (Fig. 106). N. Allegro (SAIA/ Palermo) reports on the 2010 season of excavation that started in 2005 ( AR 52 [2005-2006] 109) and further revealed the urban layout of this eighth- to seventh-century settlement. Buildings are arranged on terraces that follow the slope, along at least one east-west running street, separated by narrow alleys that run north-south. After abandonment by the end of the seventh century, the site was re-used down to the first century BC, perhaps partly for ritual, if the remains of walls over the early settlement are those of a temenos. The excavator remarks on the arrangement of the eighth- to seventh- century structures in blocks, suggesting a form of planning attested in western Greek colonies. Elsewhere in Gortyn, the largest Classical, Roman and Byzantine site on the island, work in 2010 focused on the Roman, Late Roman and Byzantine periods and is reported elsewhere (see Dunn elsewhere in this issue). A second season of collaborative investigation at Dreros between the EfA and the 24th EPCA continues to shed further light on this predominantly Archaic to Hellenistic polis site. A. Farnoux (EfA/Paris4), S. Apostolakou and V. Zographaki (24th EPCA) report investigations in several areas of the site. In addition to clearing in the agora (sector 1), work focused on a terrace near the summit of the west acropolis (sector 3) where a second substantial Hellenistic building was revealed, containing loom weights and an exterior oven; it is suggested that this may have had a public function. In sector 4, on the summit of the west acropolis, the tempi e/andreion first explored in 1917 was investigated, showing that it in fact lay on two terraces. Beneath a nearby pavement, evidence for a sanctuary area was uncovered in the form of ceramics and several bull figurines dating to the LMIIIC to Geometric period (Fig. 107), suggesting earlier cult use before the construction of a building on the summit. Elsewhere, further evidence of substantial buildings was uncovered, notably one in sector 5, ca . 50m north of the agora (Fig. 108), which appeared to show evidence of a destruction level attributed to the sack of the city by neigh- bouring Lyktos. Classical to Roman Other than the continued excavations at Dreros mentioned immediately above, there is little archaeological fieldwork to report. However, there has been an important publication on Cretan ceramics of the period 600-400 BC by Erickson (2010). The author devotes chapters to presentation of material from Eleutherna, Knossos, Gortyn, the Ierapetra isthmus and Praisos and its territory, which feeds into historical interpretation in the final two chapters. The book's explicit goal is to address this period of the supposed 'gap' in Cretan material culture and the result is a much more nuanced picture. Also published in 2010 is an epigraphical and textual study of 12 Hellenistic to Roman gold lamellae from funerary contexts inscribed with Bacchic-Orphic texts; seven are in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, with the provenance Eleutherna, while two more (plus a further three without inscription) were recovered from burials at Sfakaki near Rethymnon ( cf. AR 50 [2003-2004] 91-92) (Tzifopoulos [2010]). Comment It is difficult to discern patterns in a relatively small number of reports, but some general points are worth noting. Firstly, among the reports for 2010, many relate to sites with a long history of excavation - Knossos (since 1878), Gortyn (1884-), Phaistos (1900-), Ag. Triada (1901-), Malia (1915-), to pick the most striking examples - or to sites to which archaeologists have returned after a considerable gap - Mochlos (1908), Printiatikos Pyrgos (1912), Dreros (1917). Clearly, despite a common perception among the general public, even sites excavated for over a century still have new data to offer and the application of modern techniques to sites 107.

Among these modern techniques are scientific and bioarchaeological analyses that are increasingly deployed in fieldwork, as the examples noted above demonstrate. The focus on sites with long exploration histories is, I suspect, a genuine pattern, not just a function of the absence among this year's reports of many notices of inter- ventions, often in a rescue context, on smaller, less well known sites. This year's reports are also relatively unusual - for an island that has seen much survey activity - in not presenting the results of active or recently completed archaeological surveys. The three surveys whose work is mentioned relate to two of the sites mentioned above with the longest history of excavation, Knossos and Phaistos. M. Bredaki (then Director, 23rd EPCA), A. Vasilakis (then 23rd EPCA) and T. Whitelaw (BSA/London) report that study continues on material from the Knossos Urban Landscape Project (KULP), a collaborative project between the BSA and the 23rd EPCA that seeks to document remains throughout the Knossos valley. A first extensive presentation of results was given by T. Whitelaw at the AGM of the BSA and is available as streamed video at: http://www.bsa.ac.uk/pages/media_lib.php?cat_id=95. The 23rd EPCA is also in collaboration with the SAIA on the Phaistos Survey, which completed its fourth season in 109.

AR 54 [2007-2008] 110), as reported by M.D. Benzi (SAIA/Pisa), F. Longo (SAI A/Salerno) and M. Bredaki (then Director, 23rd EPCA). This survey operates a strategy that resembles more that of the original Knossos Survey (Hood and Smyth [1981]) or of that around Mycenae (French et al. [2003]). The Phaistos Survey records features onto a large-scale plan (Fig. 109) and combines this with study of material collected over the site's long history of investigation as well as targeted cleaning (for example, in Zone C of a long section exposed by the road leading down from the Phaistos acropolis to the plain to the south) or small trials to clarify particular issues. This represents a productive field technique since it allows both surface and sub-surface remains to be inves- tigated simultaneously where appropriate. Elsewhere at Knossos J. Bennet (BSA/Sheffield), E. Hatzaki (Cincinnati) and A. Bogaard (Oxford) report on geophysical (magnetometer) survey carried out within the larger urban site on Lower Gypsades in 2010 (Fig. 110), and followed up in early 2011 with a second phase of resis- tivity survey. What we see in the above surveys is the bringing together and systematization of information gathered in many different contexts over many years of investigation, in the case of Knossos contextualized by a systematic surface survey of the entire valley. This trend is also being developed in other regions without formalization under a single project title. So, for example, the excavations at Priniatikos Pyrgos and Gournia tie in to the systematic surveys carried out in the Vrokastro, Gournia and Kavousi regions, as well as excavations at Kavousi (Vronda, Kastro), Azoria, Kataleimata and Chalasmenos. All of these contribute to create a potentially highly detailed overview of a substantial region of eastern Crete. The resumption of investigations in 2006 at Lato, Anavlochos and Dreros ( cf. AR 53 [2006-2007] 102-03) has similar potential, especially when combined with the new excavations at Sisi mentioned above and the ongoing excavations and regional survey ( cf AR 53 [2006-2007] 104) of the site at Malia. In the Mesara, the combination of long-term excavations at Gortyn, Phaistos, Ag. Triada and Kommos with survey results from the immediate vicinity of Phaistos mentioned immediately above, the Kommos area and the western Mesara as a whole again offers the potential for understanding long-term regional history in unprecedented detail. The focus on existing sites and the inter-linking of multiple archaeological datasets mean that we are potentially on the threshold of being able to write regional histories at new levels of resolution for several areas of the island. In closing this brief regional review of recent work in Crete, I note a third trend not entirely unconnected with the second: the expansion of information available on the internet. As indicated in the introduction to this edition of AG , this year's reports are based on AGOnline , the digital resource developed jointly by the EfA and the BSA to provide more detailed searchable summaries of archaeo- logical activity as they become available (http://chronique. efa.gr/index.php/). Moreoever, most projects now have some form of web presence, in some cases quite sophisti- cated and extensive. A great deal of information is available for Priniatikos Pyrgos (http://www.pnni- atikos.net/PPhome.html), including interactive, video and virtual reality content, and Sisi (http://www.sarpedon.be/).</page><page sequence="72">72 JOHN BENNET The Itanos Survey Project ( cfi AR 51 [2004-2005] 100-01) has an interactive site database that facilitates live mapping of the sites of all periods recorded during the project (http://prospection-itanos.efa.gr/). The site of Kommos has three websites: a general one with overall information (http : //www. fine art . u toronto . ca/kommos/ index.html), a depository for publications and field records (https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/3004) and one devoted to conservation of the site (http://www. kommosconservancy.org/), an increasingly important aspect of post-excavation work in Crete and elsewhere. For the site of Zominthos there exist both an artistically- designed interface that presents information about the site and its surrounding area, in Greek, including recent reports (http://www.zominthos.org/) and blogs covering each season's work back to 2005 on Archaeology magazine's interactive site (http://www.archaeology.org/ interactive/ zominthos/). Further, the institutions that oversee and facilitate archaeological (and other) research in Crete are developing their web presence. Thus, both the BSA and ASCSA now upload streaming video of presentations they host (referred to above in relation both to Knossos KULP and Mochlos), while the Institute for Aegean Prehistory East Crete Study Center not only makes its newsletter (Kentro: The Newsletter of the INSTAP Study Center for East Crete) available for download in pdf format, but has this year initiated an electronic version ( eKentro ) that can be read on-line or downloaded (http://www.instapstudy- center.net/e-news letter/Fall2011/index.html). The ability to present extensive visual materials, in colour, to have searchable text and the potential for inter- active content, from searchable databases to GIS mapping and virtual reality, is clearly a valuable addition to the range of tools available to all those seeking to keep up with the pace of archaeological activity in Greece.

The Neolithic culture is among the best documented in the region: this display contains a reconstruction of a magoula (Fig. 114), which allows children to open boxes to reveal the key features of a Neolithic household. A model Neolithic house illustrates the materials and processes of construction, and the diagnostic finds display household activities of the period (Figs. 115, 116). 115.

The Bronze and Iron Age displays focus on changes in settlement architecture, pottery production (with finds from sites such as Mavromati and Agnandero), metal technology and funerary customs (namely the construction of monumental tholos tombs, notably Georgikon and Dranista/Ktimeni; Fig. 117). Iron Age and Archaic finds are represented by the tholos tomb at Ag. Theodoroi, and representative artefacts from the hero shrine of Aiatos by the tholos tomb at Georgikon (A/? 52 [2005-2006] 75-76) and votives from the sanctuary at Philia (ID 1050/2003). The political organization of Thessaly in tetrads is the focus of a display entitled ancient cities. The modern prefecture of Karditsa occupies the territories of ancient Thessaliotis and the southern part of ancient Hestiaiotis. In the mountainous regions of Pindus lived the Athamanians, and in the Agrafa to the south the Dolopians. Prominence is given to what was to become the federal Sanctuary of Athena Itonia at Philia (Figs. 118, 119), established in the Mycenaean period. A central feature of this shrine, reconstructed in the display, is the tree in the sacred alsos, with votives hanging from its branches: a range of votives is also shown (Fig. 120). The presentation of artefacts follows the sequence in which the ancient cities are mentioned in the second- century BC Delphic inscription describing the route of the theodorokoi : Kierion, Orthe, Kelethra, Methylion, Metropolis, Gomphoi and Argithea. Notable finds include: stamped tiles that corroborate the identification of ancient cities with modern settlements; votives from the 117.

In 2004, after two years of restoration, the new permanent exhibition of the museum was inaugurated, presenting many new discoveries alongside old exhibits, and a temporary exhibition on Games and Contests in Ancient Thessaly (under the directorship of V. Adrymi-Sismani, now Director of the Archaeological Institute of Thessalian Studies). Two rooms of the permanent exhibition, focusing on Neolithic culture and burial practices, have remained virtually unchanged in homage to the innovative displays of their time (1975) by Hourmouziadis. In 2009, a century after the opening of the museum, a new wing was opened to the public (under the directorship of A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou). Here the development of the Thessalian cities in the region of the Gulf of Pagasai from Mycenaean times to the end of the Imperial period is explored, focusing on Iolkos (Dimini/Palia Volou), Pherai (and the Sanctuary of Herakles in its chora, at Spartia Latomeio), the Sanctuary of Apollo at Soros and Demetrias. In the same year, the museum became part of the iMuse (http://imuse.cereteth.gr) programme, which was completed in April 2011. As A. Doulgeri- Intzesiloglou and B.

The system caters for audiences of different ages in Greek, English and French: screens in a central info- kiosk in the museum allow visitors to obtain detailed information about the exhibits on display and to relate them to their find-spot and the relevant archaeological sites via photos and short videos. The centenary of the museum was also celebrated with a conference organized by the 13th EPCA on 17 May 2010, entitled loropia ttis ApxccioXoyiKris YnripEcn'as Kai rriS ApxcuoXoyiKrjs 'Epsuvas ott' OeooaXia ( The History of the Archaeological Service and the Archaeological Exploration of Thessaly). Papers focused on archival material pertaining to the organization of the Ephorates in the region, key figures in Thessalian archae- ology, major excavations, conservation and educational programmes, and the work of the BSA and the Netherlands Archaeological Institute in Thessaly. New Diachronic Museum of Larissa The New Diachronic Museum of Larissa (AR 47 [2000-2001] 81), on the Mezourlo Hill at the southern edge of the city, has housed the administrative offices of the 15th EPCA and 7th EBA since November 2010. The complex, built on land given by the Municipality of Larissa was completed in 2006: it includes workshop and conservation areas, storage rooms, a main exhibition area, an amphitheatre, room for educational programmes and an audio- visual room. In 2009-2010 the museological study for the new permanent exhibition was approved, and preparation is now underway. This is a regional museum, aiming to display antiq- uities from the entire region while focusing on local features/regional peculiarities. The permanent exhibition will display artefacts from the Palaeolithic to the post- Byzantine period. In May 2011, as part of the International Day of Museums, the Museum opened for the first time to the public (see press release of 16 May 2011 at: http://www.eleftheria.gr/viewarticle.asp7aid =28799&amp;pid=7&amp;CategoryID=7) with a series of talks and a small representative display with finds from various sites and periods in the temporary exhibition area. The main exhibition room is expected to be ready in 2013. Archaeological work in Thessaly There has been an extraordinary increase in our knowledge of ancient and Byzantine Thessaly during the last decade due to a variety of reasons. During the 1990s and the early 2000s, very large public works such as the new national roads that traverse the region north-south and east-west necessitated salvage archaeology on an equally large scale. In western Thessaly, a region often underplayed in studies of Thessaly and characterized as a backwater, the creation of the 34th EPCA in 2004 resulted in a notable intensifi- cation of archaeological activity (recording of new sites, salvage excavations, conservation and preparation of archaeological sites/monuments for the general public). On the occasion of the 2004 Olympics, with Volos being among the host cities, the 13th EPCA undertook a major restoration project of the old museum that resulted in the new permanent exhibitions inaugurated in 2004 and 2009 (see above), and the systematic recording of archival material and artefacts in the storerooms of the old</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 77 museum. As with the Volos Museum, the redisplays and preparations for the opening of new museums at Karditsa and Larissa have led to careful study of the archaeological finds from the region and a revisiting of old excavations. Finally, the organization of conferences on Thessalian archaeology ( Ergo ton Ephoreion and AEThSE) at regular intervals since 1998, where, on the model of AEMTh , new archaeological activity is presented and then rapidly published, has communicated the results of new discov- eries to the academic community quickly. Although in many cases full publication is pending, careful reading of these reports allows us to appreciate the complexity of the archaeological record of the region and to challenge widely accepted paradigms about its culture - for example with regards to its alleged 'feudal' system and primitive organization. It is difficult in this brief and selective report to cover all news of archaeological activity in the region. We will therefore focus on a few sites and themes for which recent work has allowed a more comprehensive presentation. Other important new finds, such the discovery by Y. Pikoulas of an ancient road with wheel tracks in use though several periods near Damasi Tyrnavou, will be discussed in more depth once the research (in this case the University of Thessaly 's project on road systems and defence in Thessaly; ID2030/2010) is completed. The very important exploration by the 7th EBA (S. Sdrolia and her colleagues) of eastern Kissavos has shed light on the vibrancy and density of the monastic commu- nities of the region, the so-called 'Oros ton Kellion', during the Middle Byzantine period (ID2000/2006). Work on eastern Kissavos has highlighted the difficulty of exploring this steep, often densely forested, land and consequently the scarcity of secure conclusions regarding the identity of ancient settlements on the northeastern Magnesian peninsula. Sdrolia's investigations at Kastro Velikas (ID1356) and the coastal zone of Velika have revealed an important Early Christian fortified settlement, with a rampart that controlled the coastal road that led to southern Greece, while bypassing Tempi, and coastal installations of some importance, for example the olive press found in relation to an Early Christian basilica (ID2027/2009). This is so far the only Early Christian settlement to be systematically explored in eastern Kissavos. Sdrolia has tentatively identified it with Roman/Early Christian Meliboia. Excavations on this site are continuing, and since 2011 focus on the early Christian basilica found north of the eastern gate of Kastro Velikas (in collaboration with the University of Thessaly and I. Verelis; see press release in Eleutheria Larissas of 18 July 201 1 : http://www.eleftheria.gr/viewarticle.asp?aid=30587 &amp;pid=7&amp;CategoryID=7). Further north, near Tempi, an Early Christian settlement has come to light, with a building of the sixth century AD, perhaps a wine press (ID 1357). Given the importance of these finds and of recent excavations in the region of Perrhaibia (ID1055-1057), their full presentation will appear in a future volume of AG. In 2009, a five-year interdisciplinary project began under the leadership of E. Skafida (13th EPCA), funded by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism and INSTAP, to study, re-evaluate and publish the finds from D.R. Theocharis' excavations at the Late Bronze Age settlement of Kastro-Palaia Volou (Fig. 124). The excavations studied were conducted between 1956-1961 124.

Skafida). under the auspices of the Archaeological Society of Athens. In Trench III (Fig. 125) Theocharis revealed part of a two-storey building complex with a courtyard, plastered floors and a room with wall-painting fragments preserving blue and red colour. Theocharis dated the building to the LHIIIB period and identified it as a 'palace'. In 2009 and 2010, study of the excavator's archive and cleaning of the preserved structures allowed for the drafting of a new site plan, with new observations on stratigraphy and architectural phases. A small-scale excavation is planned for 2011 to clarify further questions of stratigraphy and architecture. In 2009, during the initial cataloguing of the pottery from Theocharis' excavations, two fragments of clay tablets inscribed in Linear B were identified. Their first presentation was made during the 13th Mycenological Colloquium in Paris in September 2010 by E. Skafida, A. Karnava and J.-P. Olivier (Skafida et al. [forthcoming]). The first fragment (Figs. 126, 127) comes from the middle part of a leaf-shaped tablet, in an excellent state of preser- vation. It bore four lines of writing and, according to Skafida et al. (forthcoming), the partially attested words show that the fragment could refer to small axes, a manufacturer (or more) of head-bands, followed by nouns or adjectives. The second fragment is in a very bad state of preservation and very little is discernible. 125.

Volos: tablet fragment VOL X 1, recto. © The Late Bronze Age Site of Kastro-Palaia on the Bay of Volos Project (A. Karnava). Until recently the only known examples of evidence for the use of writing in Late Bronze Age Thessaly were the non-archival inscriptions found at Dimini (Adrimi- Sismani and Godart [2005]). The finds from Kastro-Palaia are the first Linear B tablets from Thessaly, and inevitably change our perception of the region as being 'peripheral' to the Mycenaean world, since they imply the existence of an active administration and archives, and ultimately certify the identity of the site as that of a Mycenaean administrative centre. As Skafida et al. stress, 'The archaeological evidence from the bay of Volos, with at least three settlements in close proximity and a suspected fourth one, to which the recently uncovered tholos tomb at Kazanaki should probably be linked, does not lend itself to easy interpre- tation'. Be that as it may, these new finds will inevitably lead specialists to re-evaluate the importance and the role of the three Mycenaean settlements around the Pagasitic gulf, namely the impressive complex at Dimini and the settlements at Pefkakia and Kastro-Palaia Volou, and to rethink the way(s) in which they functioned as a Mycenaean polity. Similarly, a re-evaluation of the regional networks and the relationships between various major Mycenaean centres was encouraged by examination of the archival material pertaining to A.S. Arvanitopoulos' 1911 excavation of the tholos tomb at Dranista (Ktimeni) in western Thessaly. Study of the ca. 350 finds and the archives showed that the use of the tomb should be dated to LHIIIA-B (with some earlier finds). This rich tomb demonstrates that the large tholos tomb at Georgikon is not a unicum for western Thessaly, but rather a product of the archaeological exploration of the region (I. Galanakis and M. Stamatopoulou, forthcoming in the proceedings of AEThSE 3; the publication of the tomb is in preparation by I. Galanakis). 127.

Attic pottery in Thessaly The international conference Oi Eioaycoyes rrjs cxttiktis ueXavouopyrjs Kai epudpdjjopcpris KEpafjiKrji ; orrj QeooaXia {Imports of Attic black- and red- figure pottery in Thessaly) was organized by A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou (13th EPCA) and D. Palaiothodoros (Thessaly) in Volos, 3-5 December 2010. Some 20 papers were delivered, focusing on the presentation of new finds from the region, mainly the result of rescue excavations, and on the re-evalu- ation of old finds, notably from Pharsalos and Chtouri. The first session was devoted to Attic pottery in Boeotia (V. Sabetai), Phthiotis (F. Dakoronia) and Macedonia (S. Drougou), and the remaining sessions focused on Thessaly. Exceptionally interesting were finds from western Thessaly (presented by L. Hatziangelakis, P. Theogianni and Ch. Karagiannopoulos) where rescue excavations necessitated by public works (in particular the construction of the National Road E65) have led to the location and partial investigation of numerous new sites. One should single out the recently excavated site near Ag. Triada, 13km north of Karditsa, where a large settlement of the Archaic period has produced pottery from the seventh to the first half of the fifth century. The discovery of two black-figure fragments attributed to Sophilos is indicative of the wealth and quality of the ceramic assem- blages found. Attic pottery, mainly black-glaze but also black-figure and red-figure, has been identified at numerous sites: Ermitsi (ancient Peirasies), Palamas, Gefyria (possibly Thetonion), the cemeteries of Kierion, the Sanctuary of Athena Itonia at Philia, Myrine, Agnandero, as well as in the eastern cemetery at Argithea in Athamania. These finds are a powerful reminder that western Thessaly is still largely unknown, mainly due to the nature of the exploration of the region. Attic pottery did reach western Thessaly, if not in great quantity, and the area was evidently not as isolated as sometimes claimed.</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 79 A number of papers discussed finds from sites along the Pagasitic gulf. S. Alexandrou presented the pottery from the south cemetery of Phthiotic Thebes, modern Mikrothives, where Grave 8 (Alektorides property) contained unusually rich material for the region, including an inscribed cup with the name KP0I205! (noting also a cup of unusual shape in Tomb 4 on the property of G. Zotis, illustrated on the conference poster). G. Vitos and M. Panagou presented the pottery from the Sanctuary of Apollo at Soros (including the well- known fourth-century Panathenaic amphora; ID227) and P. Triantafyllopoulou that from the cemeteries at Alykes/Soros ( AR 40 [1993-1994] 46 sv Demetrias; AR 41 [1994-1995] 28, Soros: Asprogeia Neon Pagason). In the latter, Attic pottery (mainly lekythoi) was plentiful in the first half of the fifth century, but the quality of imports does not seem comparable to that in the cemeteries of nearby Nea Ionia/Iolkos or Nees Pagases (see the display in Volos Museum) where notable finds include a black- figure panathenaic amphora by the Kleophrades Painter from Nea Ionia (presented by A. Batziou-Efstathiou) and a lekythos by the Providence Painter in the Volos Museum. A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou discussed the evidence from Pherai, where Attic pottery was common in the Archaic and Classical periods alongside other imports at the Sanctuary of Zeus Thaulios and Enodia and in the southern cemetery, by the municipal stadium. It is thus clear that Attic pottery reached the shores of the Gulf of Pagasai in abundance and that the sea route was, as expected, the preferred route for imports to the region. A group of papers focused on imports found in Pharsalos, including well-known vases such as Sophilos' dinos from Chtouri: on the basis of study of the fragments themselves and material in the archive of the National Archaeological Museum, G. Kavvadias, proposed that the dinos originated from a sanctuary. S. Katakouta with M. Stamatopoulou and T. Mannack presented finds from Pharsalos (N. Verdelis' excavations of the western cemetery of the city and from the fifth-century House of Dysmenta; ID2023). The tholos tomb containing the well- known krater in the manner of Exekias was much discussed (also by G. Kavvadias), with most scholars endorsing its interpretation as a heroon. A second tholos tomb in the same cemetery contained numerous black- figure amphorae of the end of the sixth or early fifth century, two of which were presented by T. Mannack. The concentration of five black-figure amphorae in a single tomb, albeit a tholos, is unusual for Thessaly but very appropriate for an elite tomb of archaizing architectural form in a city of the standing of fifth-century Pharsalos, with its strong Athenian connections. Equally interesting is the realization that good quality Athenian pottery (red- figure cups, kraters, etc.) was also widely used in domestic contexts during the first half of the fifth cenury. Similar finds are known from Larissa (see AR 34 [1987-1988] cover, 37 for cup by the Euergides Painter in a house on Georgiou B' street). Some speakers focused on individual vases or types - as K. Volioti and A. Smith who discussed the Haimonian lekythoi found in the region, D. Palaiothodoros who presented an oinochoe of the Fat Boy group, M. Lakaki- Marchetti who discussed two white-ground lekythoi found at Agiokampos and K. Stamoudi who presented the important calyx krater by the Niobid Painter from the settlement at Ag. Konstantinos by the coast of Pelasgia. This conference, and the planned publication of its proceedings, offers an essential tool for the study of Attic pottery distribution in the region. It is hoped that the publication will also include papers on Larissa, the cemeteries at Krannon (Sarmanitsa tumulus: AR 20 [1973-1974] 23, Fig. 41; AR 42 [1995-1996] 24), Halos, Nea Ionia and Nees/Pagases.

Ancient theatres The proceedings of a day conference on ancient theatres in Thessaly, organized by the Archaeological Institute of Thessalian Studies (under the directorship of V. Adrymi- Sismani) and the Municipality of Volos on 27 April 2009, were published in 2010. Ancient theatres have been inves- tigated at Larissa (AR 46 [1999-2000] 76; AR 47 [2000-2001] 81-82), Demetrias (AR 45 [1998-1999] 70; AR 48 [2001-2002] 61-62, Fig. 99) and Phthiotic Thebes. The conference proceedings offer the specialist a detailed description of the monuments, supplementing specialist monographs, such as Sear (2006). A number of papers focused on the activities of the Diazoma society which funds the current work at the theatre of Phthiotic Thebes. L. Hatziangelakis and A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou discussed the potential for the discovery of ancient theatres in western Thessaly and Pherai respectively. Three key papers focused on the three major theatre sites. A. Tziafalias (former Director, 15th EPCA) discussed the history of exploration of the two theatres found in Larissa. Theatre A, on the slopes of the Phrourion Hill, was built in the third century BC and remained in use until the early fourth century AD. It could accommodate around 10,000 spectators and must have served as a meeting place of the Thessalian koinon. The names of Thessalian cities that were members of the League were inscribed on certain seats. Tziafalias presented the long process of appropriating and clearing the land, a brief description of the theatre's architectural form and phases, and the plans for the full restoration of the monument. Theatre B, at the corner of Ergatikis Protomagias and Tagmatarchou Belissariou Streets on the Pefkakia Hill, was built in the first century BC using architectural material from Hellenistic buildings, some bearing inter- esting inscriptions (for example, manumission inscriptions of the late third century BC). The rich epigraphic material from the theatres is being studies by B. Helly and his team in collaboration with A. Tziafalias. B. Intzesiloglou discussed the theatre of Demetrias, situated west of the Anaktoron on a hill whose summit preserves the remains of a major public monument, perhaps related to the founder cult of Demetrios Poliorketes. He recounted the history of its exploration and provided detailed information about its architectural phases from the early third century BC to the late fourth</page><page sequence="80">80 MARIA STAMATOPOULOU century AD, changes in its layout and use, and the various structures/workshop areas that were built in the area during a period of disuse from the late first century BC to the first half of the first century AD. Since the spring/summer of 2011, systematic excavation and restoration work has begun on the site with European Union support. V. Adrymi-Sismani offered full documention of the current state of research on Phthiotic Thebes, which she has been excavating since 1991. Phthiotic Thebes, near modern Mikrothives (formerly Aketsi), was a major city in antiquity, controlling a rich and fertile chora and the harbour of Pyrasos, and thus offering the Thessalians an alternative exit to the sea (especially when Macedonians controlled the harbour in the area of Pagasai/Demetrias, modern Volos). The site is largely undisturbed by modern activity and its major monuments - the impressive fortifi- cation rampart, the Sanctuary of Athena Polias (in use since the Geometric period), the Sanctuary of Asklepios and the theatre on the northern side of the acropolis - are ideal for the creation of an archaeological park. The theatre, on the north slope of the acropolis, has uninterrupted views of the Krokian plain and the sea. It was first explored by Adrymi-Sismani between 1992-1994, when the central part of the auditorium, the retaining walls of the parodoi and remains of the Roman phase of the stage building and the proskenion were revealed. It is estimated to have had a capacity of around 3,000 spectators, and was in use from the third century BC to the fourth AD, when it was abandoned. As the theatres at Larissa and Demetrias, this theatre was adapted in Roman times to house gladiatorial games. Systematic investigation of the site was resumed in 2010, sponsored by Diazoma. As Adrymi-Sismani reports (ID2034), work in 2010 focused on the orchestra, locating the original floor of the Hellenistic and Roman periods (which were on the same level). There were no traces of an altar or of drainage channels, except for the southern extremity of the orchestra. Work on the stage building revealed: that the west wall of the building was 14.54m long; a coin dating its renovation/rebuilding after AD 217; marble architec- tural members from its Hellenistic phase (parts of Ionic columns); fragments of four columns of green Thessalian marble, which hint at an elaborate decoration of the stage building during Roman times. See also Adrymi-Sismani (2010). Maritime archaeology Knowledge of the maritime and economic activity of the east coast of Magnesia and the northern Sporades has been significantly enhanced as a consequence of the intense exploration begun in the 1990s by the Ephoreia of Maritime Antiquities (EMA), the Hellenic Institute of Marine Archaeology (IENAE) as well as the collaborative Persian War Shipwreck Survey (ID229), which inspected the east coast of Magnesia, and the sonar survey of the northern Sporades by the EMA and the Norwegian Institute at Athens (ID521). In 2010 and 2011 the work of the EMA and IENAE in Magnesia was presented on two occasions, at the conference AvccSei^tj tou EvaAiou apxaioXoyiKou ttAoutou tou voixou Mayvrjoias organized by the prefecture of Magnesia, the EMA, 13th EPCA and IENAE (Volos, 11 September 2010) (ID1963/2010) and the annual lecture on the work of the IENAE (20 June 2011). IENAE 's activity in the southern Pagasitic gulf began in 2000 and concentrated on the region of Amaliapolis- Nies. To date, 14 shipwrecks have been identified, many of which date to the Late Roman and Byzantine periods. For example, the cargo of a wreck by the islet of Kikynthos, at the entrance of the bay of Amaliapolis, consisted of at least five types of pithoi (12th- 13th century AD). Off cape Glaros, two Hellenistic shipwrecks have been noted. Thus far, the most important evidence comes from Shipwreck 7 near the Telegraphos cape, 5 nautical miles south of Amaliapoli, which has been investigated since 2003 by S. Demesticha and E. Spondylis. Its cargo consisted mainly of wine amphorae of at least seven different types, two of which were recently identified as very rare (ID2028/2010). As the excavators themselves emphasize, the discovery and systematic investigation of a shipwreck of the late fourth century AD - a period of significant change in the Roman Empire with the gradual shift of emphasis to the east - is important not only because this is the first of its period to be investigated in the Aegean but also because it may be possible to trace the origin of its cargo and ultimately the course of the ship. Coastal sites along the southern Pagasitic gulf flourished during the Late Roman and Early Christian periods, as revealed by the excavations of the 7th EBA in the domestic areas and the harbour of Phthiotic Thebes by Nea Anchialos (ID1081-1082, 1084-1089, 2029) and Almyros of the Byzantine period (especially under Venetian rule) (ID225). The combined study of data from shipwrecks and land excavations could therefore lead to a far better appreciation of the strategic and economic importance of these coastal towns. No shipwrecks were identified by the Persian War Shipwreck Survey in the waters of the Magnesian coast between cape Sepias on the south (near Theotokou) and the northern end of Magnesia near the Peneios delta. However, the identification of submerged parts of ancient settlements (such as Theotokou) and combined work by the 15th EPCA and 7th EBA in the area of Velika/Agiokambos have allowed us to understand the course of this sea route, along anchorage sites/cities like Nies by Amaliapolis, Nea Anchialos (Phthiotic Thebes), Demetrias, possibly Chondri Ammos (in the territory of ancient Olizon), Theotokou and further north at Skiatha/Kato Polydendri. Underwater investigations along the other major sea route to the north, in the northern Sporades, have been equally fruitful. More than ten shipwrecks have been identified in the straits between Alonissos (ancient Ikos) and the now deserted islets of Ag. Petros, Kyra Panagia (by Katergo: AR 46 [1999-2000] 107), Peristera (Classical and Byzantine wrecks: ID522; AR 46-48 [1999-2002]), Psathoura (fourth-century amphorae: AR 46 [1999-2000] 107-08) and Skantzoura. They date from the mid fifth century to the post-Byzantine period (Alonissos), confirming the diachronic importance of this sea route to Mount Athos and the northern Aegean. The two well-known Classical shipwrecks off the Phagrou islet (investigated by D. Haniotis: AR 46 [1999-2000] 107-08, Figs. 105-07; AR 48 [2001-2002] 59, Figs. 94-97) and the Peristera shipwreck (investigated by E. Hatzidaki: AR 43-48 [1996-2002]; ID522) are dated to the mid and late fifth century respectively, and bear testimony to the strategic and economic importance of the northern Sporades when Athens dominated maritime</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 81 commerce in the Aegean. Control of the islands was essential for anyone with maritime/military ambitions in the region: Skiathos could have served as an additional station of control of the route along the Magnesian coast (see the towers by Koukounaries and Kechrias) and as a winter base for troops (Hdt. 7.183; Dem. 4.32). Similarly, Peparethos was useful for anchorage (Diod. 15.95.1-2), as well as for its agricultural production and wine trade (Dem. 35.35), and Ikos, modern Alonissos, occupied a strategic position which monitored the sea-pass via Peristera and Kyra Panagia. The Phagrou and Peristera shipwrecks contained strik- ingly similar cargoes: wine amphorae from Mende and/or Peparethos (the latter in the Peristera shipwreck), alongside a secondary cargo of black-glazed Attic finewares and a few bronze symposium items (a ladle, situla, etc.). They have contributed to a better awareness of sea routes and cargo sizes during the period of Athenian control in the Aegean, and have served as points of comparison for other recently identified shipwrecks, for example the fifth-century shipwreck at Tekta§ Burnu, off the Asia Minor coast at Erythrai (Carlson [2003]), and the recently investigated early fourth-century wreck between Chios and Oinousses (ID649, 827). The size of the cargo of the Peristera shipwreck, estimated at 3,000-4,000 amphorae, shows that merchant ships in the Classical period were far larger than previ- ously believed and that the scale of mercantile activity in the fifth and fourth centuries should thus be reassessed. In addition, the discovery of Mendean as well as Chian amphorae in many shipwrecks of the region is witness to the increase in Athenian trade with the northern Aegean during the mid to late fifth century. A significant number of Peparethian pointed amphorae was found in the cargo of the Peristera wreck. Peparethos (modern Skopelos), as a member of the Athenian League, was assessed for a tribute of three talents (in the Athenian Tribute Lists: as opposed to 1,000 drachmae from Skiathos and 1,500 from Ikos). The wrecks have not been fully explored nor have the contents of the amphorae been investigated or analysed for residues. It cannot therefore be proven beyond doubt that they were carrying exclu- sively wine: for example, in the Tekta§ Burnu wreck the Mendean amphorae, perhaps re-used, contained tar and beef bones, while in the aforementioned fourth-century BC wreck between Chios and Oinousses tests on the residues of the amphorae revealed that their content included oregano and olives (ID649). Nonetheless, the discovery of many Peparethian amphorae in the Peristera wreck supports the hypothesis that Peparethos was actively involved in the trading of agricultural produce, most likely wine. The economic significance of the island during the earlier fifth century is hinted at by, among other things, the fact that it minted silver coinage and dedicated an over life-sized bronze statue of Apollo at Delphi. The role of trade and viticulture as factors of prosperity in Peparethos is further revealed by the discovery of pottery workshops producing wine amphorae near the bays at Agnondas and Panormos (discussed by Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou and Garlan [1990]), and the identi- fication in 1999 of clusters of amphorae probably belonging to a Classical shipwreck off the bay of Agnondas at Drakontoschisma (ID523). The pattern met at Agnondas, namely workshop installations by the harbour/bay for the production of wine amphorae which could then be loaded on to ships in the nearby harbour, echoes the situation at numerous other sites in the northern Sporades, most notably Tsoukalia at Alonissos (ancient Ikos). There ( AR 47 [2000-2001] 70), a fourth-century BC workshop for the production of the pointed amphorae of Ikos was identified near the bay in proximity to water sources and in connection with a fortified farmhouse further up the hill. Numerous similar groupings have been observed by Skafida at other locations in the northern Sporades. Their systematic study and publication could lead to a better appreciation of the role of towers on the islands, not just for defence but also for economic exploitation of the locally available resources (Skafida 2001). For further information on maritime archaeology, see Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou (2000) especially 349-50; Hadjidaki (1996); Haniotis and Kazianis (2001); Lawall (1998); Sampson (2000) especially 398-406; Skafida (2001); Vlachopoulos (2006); on towers and farmhouses in the northern Sporades, see Skafida (2000) . Demetrias A. Batziou-Efstathiou and Y. Pikoulas have recently published (2006) a stele with a manumission inscription, dated between the first century BC and the first century AD, which was found in 2005 during the excavation of the Chiou-Pantelidou property in the northern sector of the city of Demetrias (ID2032; Fig. 128), providing new information about this little-known period in the city. The discovery of other honorific and votive inscriptions in the vicinity, as well as architectural remains, has led them to suppose (as P. Marzolff had previously done: [1996b] esp. 56-58) that there must have been an open public space - an agora or a sanctuary - in this part of Demetrias, northeast of the theatre in the flat area near the presumed stadium (Kyprou-Zerva Street, property of K. Nikos: AR 40 [1993-1994] 47). Marzolff had proposed that the elaborate equestrian statue groups, whose bases were found in secondary use in the Damokratia basilica (also carrying manumission inscriptions, but of the third century AD), were originally set in this public area. In recent years, rescue operations undertaken by the 13th EPCA (mainly by A. Batziou-Efstathiou, now Director of the 15th EPCA, and P. Triantafyllopoulou) due to increased building activity in the district of Aivaliotika, in the area of the northern sector of Demetrias, have revealed much new evidence about the city in Hellenistic and especially Roman times. Together with B. Intzesiloglou's systematic excavations of the theatre, they have refined our understanding of its topography, urban layout, domestic and public architecture, and its religious life. The publication of two epigraphic monuments from the city (in the volume in honour of Ch. Habicht: Pikoulas [2006]) confirm beyond doubt that Demetrias was fully integrated into the Macedonian state/administration. The first, discussed by Ch. Intzesiloglou (2006; cf. AR 40 [1993-1994] 47) bears the edict of Philip V (dated to 184 BC) regarding the dress of the Hunters of Herakles Kynagidas. The second, by A. Batziou-Efstathiou and Y. Pikoulas (2006), is a senatus consultum referring to the basilike chora. It is beyond the scope of this brief report to discuss in depth recent findings regarding Hellenistic Demetrias. It should, however, be noted that excavations on the coastal Pefkakion Street (Pallikara property: AR 52 [2005-2006]</page><page sequence="82">82 MARIA STAMATOPOULOU 128.

It clearly included the northern sector of the fortifications, since below the Late Roman building complex a 24.4m-long stretch of the wall and an enlarged tower were exposed, revealing the course of the fortifica- tions in this part of the city. The discovery of numerous Hellenistic houses gives an indication of their plan, architectural ornamentation and the use of rooms. Numerous houses were partially inves- tigated in 1978-1980 in the eastern sector of the city (see also AR 48 [2001-2002] 60-61, Tyrous Street), showing that they conformed to the Hippodameian plan of the city. In the area of the harbour and especially in the western part of the city a number of elaborately decorated houses have been revealed, for example the house north of the theatre on the property of Ph. Choutas and K. Katsonis (AR 45 [1998-1999] 70), which had plastered and painted walls, a room with evidence for lead working (for the repair of vases) and a domestic shrine. The constraints of rescue excavation mean that no Hellenistic house has been fully revealed or excavated, but the partially explored houses in the city offer much information. We note, for example, workshops within domestic quarters, as on the Lagos property ca. 750m east of the theatre (ADelt 34 [1984] Chr 142-44; ADelt 35 [1985] Chr 185); domestic shrines (for example, the aforementioned house near the theatre and a house on the Zervas property: AR 41 [1994-1995] 35; AR 42 [1995-1996] 22); and what may be public cult spaces, such as that on the Katsipha property at Aivaliotika (ID 1062). Domestic architecture in the city, and especially domestic shrines, can now be compared to examples from numerous Thessalian cities (for example, Pharsalos, Lamia, Halos) and now demands study in greater depth. After the defeat of the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, Demetrias became the seat of the Magnesian koinon until AD 293. No longer a major military stronghold and without the Macedonian kings'</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 83 patronage, the city continued to function as a commercial centre. However, as Strabo records, during the early Imperial period the city was reduced in size. This contraction is confirmed archaeologically since large parts of the Hellenistic city, especially in the south, were abandoned and used as burial grounds. The nucleus of the city lay in the northern sector, near the harbour. Major public monuments were abandoned and their use changed. Besides the fortifications, which were repaired and enhanced in the early first century BC, the best example of a change in use is offered by the Anaktoron, the former symbol of Macedonian control in the city. In the northern wing of the abandoned building several installations have been unearthed: a bronze-casting workshop containing furnaces, parts of equestrian statues and debris, and three pottery kilns. From the third century AD onwards, the southern and eastern wings became a burial ground (AR 43 [1996-1997] 59; AR 48 [2001-2002] 60). Similarly, a period of disuse of the city's theatre, probably from the mid first century BC to the first century AD, is implied by the discovery of a coin hoard on a wall of a building erected by the northern parodos (AR 45 [1998-1999] 70) and pottery workshops in the vicinity of the southern parodos (AR 48 [2001-2002] 61-62, Fig. 99). As with other parts of the city, a new peak of building activity occurred in the late second and third centuries, noting a new construction phase in the theatre and repairs to the aqueduct (AR 48 [2001-2002] 61, Fig. 100). The theatre remained used until the mid fourth century AD. During the Roman period, the hub of the city lay around the northern harbour and modern Aivaliotika, that is in the area between the theatre and the Anaktoron (west- east), and the coast. At Aivaliotika, along Lemesou, Paphou and N. Zerva Streets, rescue excavations have demonstrated the density of Roman habitation as well as the diachronic settlement history of the area; there are often many phases beneath the Late Roman level, occasionally extending back to the Classical (fourth century BC), pre- dating the foundation of Demetrias. The later buildings, especially those of the second to first century BC, roughly followed the layout of their predecessors and respected the contours of streets. They could be elaborately decorated with mosaic floors and plastered walls (see, for example, findings on the property of R Papachatzis at Lemesou Street: ADelt 53 [1998] Chr 414-15). Many scholars, including Marzolff, Batziou- Efstathiou and Triantafyllopoulou, have remarked that the first century AD seems to have been a period of contraction and perhaps decline. In contrast, the late second and third centuries saw an increase in building activity and implied prosperity, as evidenced by the numerous elaborate private and public buildings excavated during the last 15 years. Elaborate dwellings have been discovered in the harbour area, such as the complex revealed by the coastal Peflkakion Street (on the properties of K. Pallikara and E. Michalopoulou: ID 1048; and ID 1061, the Sefel-Kounoupi property), where, besides elaborate mosaic floors, there is evidence of shops selling food and drink (the so-called 'taverna'). The taverna is now displayed in the Volos Archaeological Museum. The quantity and quality of pottery found at the site supports a sound typology of the Roman pottery attested in the city. Other richly ornamented third-century houses west of the Damokratia basilica indicate that this area had a tradition of elaborate dwellings, culminating in a late(?) fourth-century private house (AR 18 [1971-1972] 15, Fig. 25) with a layout and mosaic decoration that relate closely to the nearby basilica. Recent trial trenches on a low hill to the northwest of the Damokratia basilica A (on the Voulgaris property: ID 1060) confirm the existence of baths in its vicinity. This association of basilica and baths is attested elsewhere in the region (see Phthiotic Thebes: ID1084-1085).

In the context of a recent review of the long-term evidence for settlement patterns in Macedonia, focusing particu- larly on early prehistory but also taking into account Bronze Age and later developments, Kostas Kotsakis meditates on the very different approaches that have been applied to the investigation of historic sites in northern and southern Greece respectively. I translate from his introduction:1 It is quite clear, however, that since the beginnings of prehistoric research on ancient Macedonia, the region has been approached in terms of a north-south opposition. It could be put like this: it was southern Greece, the locus of Classical civilization and of Greek prehistory, which had, since the 18th century, constituted the central stereotype of a European vision of Greece, beguiling the European imagination by means of tourism, representations of landscape on lithographs and romantic descriptions of Classical places , and of archaeological artefacts themselves, of course. This European perspective was, he goes on to say, critical for the ways in which research came to be struc- tured; what he calls the 'epistemology' of the kind of archaeology practised in the south, with its emphasis on the history of art as a 'superior form of civilization'. By the same token, Macedonia and Thessaly were the catalysts for a different kind of archaeology. He refers here to the study of prehistoric sites in Macedonia, beginning with excavations at Nea Nikomedia in the 1960s, and to a raft of investigations over the course of the last half century which have concentrated on environ- mental, behavioural and contextual issues. Although William Heurtley, the author of the first attempt to present a comprehensive account of the region in his Prehistoric Macedonia (1939), wanted to show that Macedonia proceeded in step with southern Greece, it is the absence of various 'southern' features that has, according to Kotsakis, become especially striking to researchers in the north. This has led to considerable discussion in the specialist literature about exactly what the perceived differences actually entail. At times these perceptions have amounted to a kind of cultural barrier (Kotsakis [2009] 232). 1 'II est indubitable cependant que, des le debut de la recherche prehistorique macedonienne, la region a ete abordee par opposition au sud. On pouvait s'y attendre: c'etait le sud de la Grece, l'espace de la civilisation classique et de sa prehistoire, qui avait des le XVIIIe siecle constitue le stereotype central de la vision europeenne sur la Grece, en seduisant 1 imagination des Europeens a travers le tourisme, les representations lithogra- phiques des paysages, la description romantique des lieux du classicisme et bien sur les objets archeologiques eux-memes' (Kotsakis [2009] 231). One of the conceptual tools applied in the debate more recently has been that of 'social complexity', notably in the context of the presence or absence of 'palatial' accumulation and storage. Kotsakis argues that there has sometimes been a tendency to apply the term 'social complexity' to material aspects of culture as if these were stable quantities, with little regard to the fact that material manifestations are dimensions of non-material concepts and relationships. Another factor intimately associated with the former conceptual difficulties is that of ethnicity. It has become habitual to make direct connections between particular, historically determined groups and peoples, on the one hand, and identifiable archaeological sites, on the other. Kotsakis refers to the 'cultural historical' methods of Gordon Childe in the 1920s and 1930s ([2009] 233). It is worth adding that, for Classicists, there is a very strong temptation to connect peoples and places referred to by ancient authors, starting with the much discussed refer- ences in the historical narratives of Herodotus and Thucydides, to locations that have been made visible through archaeological research. When discussing movable objects, particularly ceramic material, connec- tions can, and have, been made, with the kinds of movements of peoples to which these authors refer. Yet archaeological investigation increasingly presents us with very different datasets - suggesting a reality that was more complex and ultimately more interesting than that of a straightforward caique of the brief and schematic reports with which ancient historians have, inadvertently perhaps, provided us. The most striking aspects of field research in Macedonia have two distinct dimensions. One of these dimensions concerns the language of cultural products. The ceramic repertoire shows that the north was, in practice, closely in touch with its southern neighbours over millennia, whilst maintaining its own distinctiveness. The other dimension relates to settlement history and settlement patterns. Contrary to the idea of fragile communities sometimes proposed, the long-term history of settlement in Macedonia reveals stable, consistent, slowly evolving patterns of rural life, deeply embedded in the ecology of the north. These patterns of subsistence were by no means uniform across the region. In some cases, particular ecological niches were exploited over very long time-scales, as at Dispilio on the side of lake Kastoria (Hourmouziadis [2008]). As Kotsakis emphasizes, ancient authors lacked the tools to appreciate long-term change. They are much more aware of ephemeral and short-term variation, phenomena that archaeological methods are poor at detecting ([2009] 254-55). There is insufficient space in a brief report to do justice to the range and scope of information that has accrued from Macedonia and Thrace even within the last decade. 2009 saw the publication of 20 Xpovia. To ApxaioXoyiKo 'Epyo gtt] MaKedovia kcxi ottj OpaKTj (20 Chr AEMTh), the 20th-anniversary volume of the journal designed to report and to showcase develop- ments in a region that had not benefited from significant research investment or systematic study until the 1980s.

Further references to this volume are included in discussion of individual sites. This account and analysis is organized around the latest material reported online for 2010-2011. It is intended to form a basis on which future reports can expand. The unavoidably syncopated nature of some of the information registered in previous volumes of AG , when editors were heavily constrained by space, may have led readers unfamiliar with the format and content of AEMTh to underestimate the wider signifi- cance of the journal, as well as its manifest role of presenting the most significant current work within the region. The publication of annual reports from Macedonia and Thrace has, since its inception, set a new standard for the speed and range of information that has been made available and has provided a model for other regions (see Thessaly). I would like to take this opportunity to underscore the importance of the content of AEMTh , not just for students of the north. The questions that Kotsakis has raised about the ways in which historians and archaeologists perceive the relationship of 'north' and 'south' have not yet been fully absorbed by scholars at large. Historians of Macedonia have as yet made comparatively little use of the new data that has been published in AEMTh (for example, in Roisman and Worthington [2010]). Some of the reasons for the gap between the appearance of the journal and the use that scholars make of its contents are quite prosaic, such as access to the volumes themselves, or a willingness to engage with field data published in a less familiar language. The online references will undoubtedly help interested scholars to be aware of new data from known sites. There is, nevertheless, some distance to travel in convincing historians that archaeological data really can play a transforming role in how we conceptualize historical processes. The accumulating information from the north should make a difference to the ways in which we perceive our subject matter as a whole, not simply as an adjustment to gaps in northern datasets. The long-term history of regions needs to find a place within the shorter- term scales of selected toponyms. Information about prehistoric activities is not irrelevant to the study of later periods, since the ways of life created on long time-scales were still relevant to those who exploited landscapes in later times (c/, for example, Soueref [2007]). The relevance of earlier patterns is apparent when we consider northern ecologies - the very visible presence of the settlement toumbas and table mounds. The exploitation of upland resources owes much to long-term patterns of resource management, including approaches to forest use and the hunting of wild species. In this issue, long-term cultural patterns in Macedonia and Thrace are also apparent in certain approaches to mortuary practice. The Middle Bronze Age tumulus burials at Valtos (phase 2) represent an important set of new data comparable to the Middle Helladic burials of central and southern Greece (see The Greek mainland in the prehistoric period). Evidence from Archaic burials recently recorded at Prionia, Grevena, and new finds at Aiani, Kozani, show that the wealthier sectors of communities deep inland enjoyed similar tastes in terms of material acquisitions to those of their peers in the coastal regions and at centres of growing regional significance, such as Vergina and Archontiko Pellas (Archontiko Giannitson). At this stage of research there are settlement locations that are better known from mortuary evidence in their vicinity than in terms of built structures, particularly residential areas. The coincidence of earlier and later burials provides some indication of the continuity of habitation - at a plethora of locations in the vicinity of Kozani and in the valleys of the river Haliakmon; at Vergina; and elsewhere. This is a topic that will be resumed in future reports of AG. At the same time, due emphasis should be given to innovations that are time-specific. I draw particular attention to the baths in the city of Pella, discovered in 1997 and presented in a preliminary report this year, whose full publication will undoubtedly provide new insights into the changing patterns of bathing and recre- ational practices between Greek and Roman traditions. Likewise, the results of fieldwork at the Sebasteion, Kalindoia, provide a cameo both of the forms of external recognition and of informal commensality that accom- panied the introduction of the emperor cult in this northern town (see Adam-Veleni [2008]). In both cases it is archaeology that is providing discrete evidence about collective responses to institutional practice, although, in the latter, new epigraphic documents confirm the material manifestations in a particularly concrete and precise way. In the case of the baths at Pella, the long-term use and transformation of a set of local community practices offers a different kind of collective evidence for social norms. Most of the evidence used to compile this report comes from excavations, whether rescue campaigns ahead of development or long-term field projects. Future editions of AG are intended to include a wider range of analytical reports. As an example, I refer here to the discovery of examples of a thin layer of tin on pottery from Tomb III at Aineia in northern Pieria, published in 2011 (ID2269). This resembles other examples of a technique already identified in northern Pieria. Palaeolithic and Mesolithic The earliest hominid evidence in the region is still that from the Petralona cave in Chalkidiki, currently dated within the period 250,000-150,000 BP (Grim [1996]), which qualifies as Middle Palaeolithic. Contemporary, that is Middle Palaeolithic, tools have recently been identified at a number of other sites in northern Greece, including lake Kastoria and Rachona, near Pella, most recently at Samarina, in the Pindos mountains, ampli- fying the range as well as the number of registered sites in Thessaly and lower Macedonia dating to this era. The expansion of data relating to the earliest prehistory of northern Greece in recent decades is enabling us not just to recognize ways of life and forms of landscape exploitation, but also to see that there are different ways of interpreting the dynamics of human behaviour. A linear progression of Mesolithic settlement between Anatolia and the Aegean, Anatolia and the</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 87 Balkans, or the Aegean and Thessaly, does not correspond to the specific ecological responses, and the forms of landscape and zoological exploitation that we find within these regions. There is a cross-cutting of cultural and ecological practice that seems to imply multiple patterns or multiple interactions. The scope of the information currently available does not yet allow for choices to be made amongst the possible explanations of human contact and inter-relationships amongst separate groups, including those conversant with the indigenous, Gravettian traditions and those bringing new practices of food production from further south and east. This underlying multiplicity of contacts, already apparent before the development of full- blown agricultural settlements, needs to be factored into the way that we consider regional and landscape relation- ships (see the contributions to Kourtessi-Philippakis [2009]). Current investigation of habitation traces at Apsalos, near Pella, may help to illuminate these issues. Radiocarbon samples from charcoal recently tested at the Erlangen-Nuremberg laboratory have produced dates of 7937 and 7480 BC. Neolithic Among the long-term excavation projects that are continuing to yield significant new data, one of the foremost is Dikili Tash, near Philippoi in eastern Macedonia, where the results of current investigations of the environment and chronology provide new radiocarbon dates of 6400-6300 BC for the beginnings of Early Neolithic activity at the site (Figs. 129, 130 and see Fig. 20). This brings Dikili Tash more closely into relationship 130. Dikili Tash: house 1 (Late Neolithic phase II), collapsed wall with imbricated pottery. © EfA. with comparable Early Neolithic sites in western Macedonia, including Nea Nikomedia and Achilleion or Sesklo in Thessaly. These dates now provide a complete sequence from the Early to the Late Neolithic, that is, from the second half of the seventh to the end of the fifth millennium BC, filling a gap in the records for eastern Macedonia. Some of the best evidence to date of Middle and Late Neolithic housing and construction techniques comes from Avgi, near Kastoria (Figs. 131-33). Avgi I is dated to the sixth millennium (5480-4997 cal. BC) and the evidence consists principally of a series of fired clay floors, showing the imprints of wooden posts and clay packing. The 129.

Stratouli). houses were rectangular, occupying ca. 70m2 in area, and open on one side to allow the smoke of fireplaces and ovens to exit. Avgi II (fifth millennium) shows some variation in construction techniques, with foundation trenches packed with waterproof clay into which the vertical posts forming the wall structure were placed. The trenches trace rectangular outlines, as in Avgi I, although the houses were somewhat larger (70-85m2). A number of burials belong to Avgi II. These were cremations, placed in ceramic vessels vertically into the soil around a mortuary construction defined only by a burned area, whilst each pot was covered with a heap of sherds. Successive accumulations of sherds may indicate repet- itive rituals. At Kleitos 1, northwest of Kozani (Fig. 134), two sites dateable to the Late and Final Neolithic were accidentally discovered by the state electricity company mining a lignite bed. Rescue excavation identified 10 structures, whose construction of branches packed with clay, and partially decorated with incised geometric patterns, survived thanks to their conflagration (conscious firing is well documented elsewhere in the Neolithic). Inside there was evidence of large storage vessels and storage pits, as well as tools and household ceramics. Late Neolithic traces have also been discovered at Thermi, dating to the second half of the sixth millennium BC, in the Romanidis plot, southwest of the Bronze Age toumba and north of the trapeza of Thermi that belongs to the Early Iron Age (Fig. 135). This area was extensively used as a cemetery from Archaic times into Roman, and subsequently well into the Ottoman period. Some of these later burials had cut into the Neolithic settlement layers, which consist mainly of pits, the larger ones (up to 6m in diameter) being earlier than the smaller, shallower pits. The abundant ceramic material provides the dating evidence. New sites dateable to the Neolithic have also been identified at Aghia Kyriaki Paliourias, in the valley of the Haliakmon (one of the sites under threat from the Polyphytos reservoir), which has produced Bronze Age structures in clay with impressions of wooden posts, traces of a tiled hearth and storage pits, at Sykia, Giannitsa Pellas, Eidomene and Sidirokastro. At Sykia, drainage work close to the toumba , a presumed prehistoric construction, has revealed Neolithic to Bronze Age habitation levels at a maximum depth of 3.7m, dated on the basis of unslipped handmade pottery (storage jars, amphorae, bowls and dishes) and tools.</page><page sequence="89">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 89 Traces of Final Neolithic activity, including tools, ceramic finds and murex shells, as well as clay floors, have also been identified south of Late Roman structures at Giannitsa Pellas (Chatzigeorgiou plot). At Eidomene, traces of a Neolithic settlement have been largely erased during construction of a new bridge across the river Axios. At Katarraktes, near Sidirokastro, investigation of a rock-shelter revealed a succession of 132. Avgi I: second phase. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 17th EPCA (G. Stratouli). 133.

Study of the marble statuettes and ornaments from phases 1 and 2 of the Neolithic site at Promachon-Topolnica, close to the Greek-Bulgarian border on the river Strymon (Kulata crossing), continues to enlarge the range of information about cultural variety within the region. Reinvestigation of the cave of Polyphemos at Maroneia has reaffirmed its long sequence of use, from Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age to Roman and Byzantine (although the material comes from disturbed fill). The geographical and ecological distribution of Neolithic settlements is becoming clearer. There are fundamental aspects of Neolithic development that are, nevertheless, puzzling. We know something about the spatial dimensions of the site at Makrygialos, in Pieria, which covered some 600km2, an extraordinary area for an early site. This area was delimited by two parallel circular ditches (Pappa and Besios 1999; see The Greek mainland in the prehistoric period).</page><page sequence="90">90 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD Bronze Age Kotsakis' statement about long-lived sites is particularly applicable to those that began in the Neolithic and continued into the Bronze Age, or where occupation of a mound site was resumed after an interval. The relationship between settlement mounds, toumbas, and habitation in their periphery is still a challenge for researchers. The toumbas are often formidable mounds, difficult to investigate despite their usual visibility. The upper layers are often damaged or destroyed by much later activity, which makes it difficult to evaluate changing settlement strategies. Thessaloniki Toumba (Andreou and Eukleidou [2007]), Karabournaki (Tiverios [2009a]) and Archontiko Giannitson are among the toumbas where long-term projects are still under way (Tiverios [2009b]). Thessaloniki Toumba was occupied in the Middle Helladic and continued to be a very active centre until the very end of the Bronze Age and probably beyond. Archaic and Classical activity has made it very hard to identify the intervening stages. Recent investigations have focused on extricating data more effectively for these phases. What has been revealed, however, has less to do with the physical environment of the site and much more with activities carried on there. Traces of murex shells and of metallurgical crucibles, associated with the refining of gold, are connected with phases 3 to 4A, which belong to the Early Iron Age. A site that is beginning to provide a wider range of data on the Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age is Valtos (near Leptokarya). The Middle Bronze Age phase (Valtos 3, for which radiocarbon dates of 1930-1745 and 1885-1695 cal. BC have been obtained) is represented by a thick deposit rich in movable finds. The architecture was probably of mud-brick or packed mud, although no clear evidence of structural contours has been detectible, except for Building A in the southeastern sector, which was composed of at least two rooms. Seven pit burials were also excavated, dating to this period but stratigraphically later than the housing units, including two tumuli, one of which (tumulus 11) provided a radiocarbon sample dated to 2010-1770 BC. Burials were enacted in situ , with the mounds thrown up some time afterwards. The remaining pit graves were marked out by stone surrounds. Tombs 7 and 8 - which contained exceptional grave goods of gold and bronze jewellery, including a necklace of gold, bronze, glass paste and stone beads, a ring, a one-handled goblet and a cup - belonged to children, aged four and nine years respectively. Architectural remains of the subsequent Middle Bronze Age phase (Valtos 2) are more plentiful, albeit of uncertain function. Three concentric periboloi have been identified, the external two being preserved to a height of lm, as well as a TT-shaped structure (perhaps a monumental entrance to tumulus 9). Building A was reconstructed. Tumulus 1 contained three pit graves, one of which is marked out by stones. The mound fill was composed of a stone peribolos, of which five rows of stones are preserved. The three graves within it were covered with stones and a layer containing destruction material, before being concealed in an earthen mound. A radiocarbon date of 1925-1750 BC was obtained from samples in the central grave. Only one of the burials contained grave goods, that belonging to a woman aged 20-30 years, who was accompanied by a set of bronze jewellery (spiral wires called sphekoteres by the excavators, a necklace and a bracelet). Further evidence of 'pre-coloniaP activity on the island of Thasos continues to emerge. At Skala Sotiros the Bronze Age settlement appears now to have been quite extensive, with more limited development in the direction of the hill. Stone wall foundations of a style earlier identified at this site have been noted in one sector ( terrain Santomoiris ), whilst in the trench around the church of Prophitis Ilias a series of post-built structures, with various internal and external features, provide much more nuanced data. These constructions, rectangular in plan and orien- tated north-south, had two distinct phases, dateable over three centuries ( ca . 2800-2500BC, i.e. EBAII). Fifteen clay features of circular or ellipsoidal plan include at least four ovens, built on foundations of sherds and flat stones, with borders made of upright stones and clay. There are stone benches associated with grinders and mortars, as well as considerable amounts of ceramic debris and storage vessels. Among the finds are incised and stamped sherds, a fragmentary terracotta female figurine and stone tools. Bronze production is attested by industrial waste, metal fragments, parts of a tuyere and of a mould (for an axehead and a chisel). Besides the enhanced chronological precision acquired at Dikili Tash, information on Bronze Age activity during 2010-2011 from other sites has been more limited. Trial trenches dug at Aghia Kyriaki Paliourias in the Haliakmon valley produced four pit burials, only one of which contained ceramic material, a kantharos and amphora or jug of Early Bronze Age or Middle Bronze Age date. G. Karamitrou Mendesidi has reported on finds from Kryopigadi and other locations along the route of the new Kozani to Kastoria road development (20 Chr AEMTh 861-69 = ID470; cf ID1985). Mycenaean imported ceramics and Macedonian matt-painted pottery have been recorded in the Grevena area for the first time in rescue excavations ahead of the Egnatia Odos at Ivani, Prionia (ID2161). Early Iron Age Settlement patterns in the Early Iron Age of Macedonia and Thrace are among the least well understood in penin- sular Greece. The summits of Bronze Age mounds proved to be less appropriate as centres of habitation for a growing population, which spread into the surrounding lowlands as well as onto new sites. Early Iron Age traces are thus often harder to identify, either because research has been too limited or because these have been concealed by modern urban development. In this respect, the acropolis of ancient Leivithra (Leibethra), redis- covered in 1994 and subjected to selective trial trenches as part of a strategy of repair, conservation and consoli- dation, offers an opportunity to explore these develop- ments in an upland context. The acropolis is located at Kastri, a fortified spur of broadly triangular plan, extending from the southwest to northeast. It has traces of occupation from the eighth to the first century BC. In the westernmost part of the circuit, where there is a tower or gateway, there is a feature 26m long, with a mean width of 2m and a preserved height of 2.3m. The fabric of this feature is composed of two faces of irregular masonry, with the intervening gap filled with earth, stones and broken stone chips. On the southern side, the circuit wall is 1.8m wide and 2m high, made of pseudo-isodomic masonry, and can be traced for a distance of 94m. Within the circuit, two different plans, presumably representing</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 91 two successive phases of the interior layout, can be identified within the street plan and within individual house units. Early Iron Age activity has been otherwise identified, during 2010-2011 in more ephemeral ways at Makrygialos, along the coast of Pieria (ID2154) and at Kozani (ID2149). Archaic The relative paucity of new data on the layout of Early Iron Age sites is also true of succeeding centuries. This makes it hard to make sense of community changes in this important period for the development of collective forms of organization prior to written administrative civic documents. Discoveries at Aiani show that public buildings of substance were already a feature of some the sixth-century central places (Karamitrou-Mendesidi [2008]; [2009]). Elsewhere, the presence of major centres of population can be tracked largely via cemetery data. This is a very indirect way of understanding civic organi- zation and there is a real need for targeted investigation of the residential and public areas serving these populations. Investigation of the Archaic cemetery of Aiani continues to produce fundamental evidence relating to the population of the upper Haliakmon valleys. A total of 257 graves has been exposed, up to and including the 2009 season (Karamitrou-Mendesidi [2008; 2009]). One area, dubbed Sector A, has pit burials organized in two groups, separated by a distance of ca. 14m (Fig. 136). The westernmost of these two groups (excavated mainly in 1985-1986) contains burials orientated principally east- west, whilst the other, more easterly group, has nine regular rows of pits plus a 10th one further north, in which the graves revert to the east-west orientation of the western group. An elliptical mound (9.4 x 7.4m), located northeast of the easterly group of burials, contains pit T159, which is much bigger than all the others and was evidently distin- guished by its contents, even though the male incumbent had only been left with an iron spearhead and an iron strigil by looters. Sector B, which lies ca. 100m southeast of Sector A, has been excavated more recently (up until 2008). It contained 24 pit burials, which belong mainly to the Hellenistic period or later (see below). The site that has provided by far the most informative evidence for the Archaic period is at Archontiko, northwest of Pella. There is a preponderance of graves belonging either to the Early Iron Age or of Archaic date in the western cemetery (on the western slopes of 'Hill 69'), although the latest extend to ca. 280 BC. Since 2000, up until the 2008 season, a total of 1,004 burials had been exposed. The most recent investigations date the earliest graves in this cemetery in the seventh century BC. A preliminary analysis of the male burials investigated in the first half of the decade reveals a clear hierarchy amongst Archaic graves, defined by the range and complexity of the grave goods (Chrysostomou and Chrysostomou [2007]). The women's burials are at least as interesting as those of the men. The excavators have divided the male and female burials into distinct groups by rank. There is also another dimension to the way in which these burials are presented, namely in the choice of materials deposited with individuals. The range of grave goods indicates a breadth of signification, of which rank is but one. Rank may also be understood in a variety of ways - the excavators have not dwelt on the social ramifications and the social language that these objects embody. It is nevertheless worth drawing attention to the tradition of weapon burial from the earliest Early Iron Age tombs at Vergina, excavated by M. Andronikos, and of the strong mortuary patterns of association apparent there for men and women. 136. Aiani, Kozani: Sector A in the eastern cemetery. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 30th EPCA.

JS 0 *</page><page sequence="92">92 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD What seems clear is that ranking deserves deeper analysis. The proliferation of gold in male and female tombs alike calls for separate consideration. The liberal use of sheet gold on different parts of the body, including the hands, but particularly in masks and mouth-pieces (see ID484, 820, 1238, 1074, 2218), points to the close symbolic association between gold and ideas of immortality. The value ascribed to gold should be reconsidered in terms of this very specific regional signification (see also Archibald forthcoming). The overall character of the Archaic burials at Archontiko fits well into the pattern already known from other Late Archaic cemeteries excavated in lower Macedonia and the Thermaic gulf, including the well- known finds from Sindos ( cf Panti [2008] for ceramics). The 2008 season confirmed the overall tendency of men to be laid out with heads facing west, north or south, women facing east, north or south. Of the latest 84 burials reported, 13 are of Early Iron Age date, 48 Archaic, 22 Classical and 23 Hellenistic, although some fluidity exists in the distinction between the last two categories. Among the Archaic burials that deserve special note are two women's graves, containing a gold mouth-piece (T652) and a necklace of amber beads (T665); and three more, which contained not just the gold mouth-piece, but also a range of metal and clay vases (T686, T687, T688); as well as a series of male burials with a warrior's panoply, identified as belonging to 'Class 2' in the ranking system previously identified (T627, T637, T648, T651). In addition, a sub-group of male inhumations has been identified by the presence of a gold face mask. Two of these (T599, T601) were excavated in 2005. A third burial of this type (T692) was uncovered in 2008, partially cut by the stone casing of a Hellenistic burial (T691). T692 had a monumentalized entrance, consisting of several steps, on the southern side (Fig. 137). The male interment was orientated to the west and was accompanied by a rich collection of grave goods: six terracotta figurines, repre- senting a symposiast, three seated goddesses and two little birds; four painted vases that provide dating evidence (terminus post quem 530 BC): an exaleiptron (oil flask) and three black-figure vases, including a cup by the Runners Painter; gold sheets that would have covered the man's torso and clothes; a gold ring and an iron pin with a gilded head; miniature tools and a farm cart made of iron; a curved iron object; eight bronze vessels; an iron sword with gilded hilt decoration; a dagger; a bronze shield, whose handle is decorated with a stamped sheet displaying a horseman holding a spear; and an Illyro- Corinthian helmet of bronze, decorated with gold sheet bands and a frontal relief, showing a pair of incised lions (Fig. 138). A series of Archaic burials discovered during rescue excavation in advance of development for the new motorway (Egnatia Odos) at Prionia, Grevena, demon- strate the close cultural ties between coastal communities and the wealthier social groups deep into the interior. Two female pit burials, belonging to young girls, contained a rich array of grave goods. T1 contained a bronze phiale; a black-glazed skyphos; four bronze pins (two of which have relief terminals, the other two with spiraliform heads); an iron pin (with traces of fabric); silver, omega- shaped earrings with snake's head terminals; a bronze bracelet of triple spirals; a necklace with a large electrum bead; a necklace of silver lunular pendants; another bracelet of bronze and various gold sheets. T2 contained 137. Archontiko Pellas: warrior burial T692. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 17th EPCA. 138.

The skeletons of eight animals were recovered close by this tomb (three goats and five dogs), together with fragmentary bones of cattle, pigs and deer. These seem to be associated with the burials as food offerings. Further finds of mortuary remains of Archaic date were made in the Haliakmon survey (at Panaghia Diporou).</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 93 At Vergina, a further 41 Archaic burials were discovered in the cemetery of Aigai, southwest of the Early Iron Age cemetery area (Kottaridi [2009]). Only 12 of these had escaped pillage. The burials are all dateable to the sixth century BC. They were inhumations, placed in simple earth pits, the bodies placed north-south (with the heads facing south), arranged in a regular pattern, whose general orientation is east-west, with occasional groups treated separately. The grave goods consisted of one or two ceramic or bronze vessels, placed at the feet of the deceased. The ceramic repertoire includes imports from Athens, Corinth and Asia Minor, as well as items from local workshops. Metal items include phialae, lekanides, ornaments (mainly pins) and armour (some swords, mainly spearheads and short iron knives). Ceramic items consist of globular unguentaria, occasional figurines and dining equipment (kantharoi, kotyles, oinochoae and cups - including a Siana cup by the 'C' Painter, showing a procession of cavalrymen on the exterior). Classical The fifth century BC, and first two-thirds of the fourth, are less well represented in recent reports of Macedonia and Thrace. An important cemetery has recently been registered on the southeastern periphery of Edessa, where Archaic burials described as similar to those at Archontiko, Classical and early Hellenistic tombs have been recorded. At Aphytos (ancient Aphytis) in Pallene, Chalcidice, modern development in this expanding coastal resort has stimulated rescue work in several sectors of the city, revealing two different road grids (or two different phases of the layout of the road system) and a cemetery to the west of the main road between the resorts of Moudania and Kallithea. Forty four burials were uncovered, belonging to the fourth century BC and placed very close together. Nineteen of these were in situ cremations, 24 pit inhumations and four cist tombs. The grave goods were generally rather modest. The new Museum at Argos Orestiko (also known as Diocletianoupolis) has on display the monumental carved marble sphinx, dated in the first half of the fifth century BC and found at Pentavrysso, and the fourth-century BC bronze shield, inscribed with the name of the Paeonian ruler Abdoleon, found in 2000 at Makednoi (ID 1987; cf 1166). A cemetery with elite burials, including inscribed fourth-century BC gravestones, as well a wealth of imported and locally produced grave goods, was discovered on a hilltop at Pentavrysso in 2003-2004 (ID362). In this case, there is fifth-century material alongside earlier and later evidence within the immediate vicinity. This situation has not been quite so easy to discover at other sites. On the one hand, there is a prolifer- ation of Archaic burials at many sites in the region; on the other, the vigorous expansion of many civic centres, partic- ularly from the second half of the fourth century BC onwards, effectively concealed the absence of material evidence for the second half of the fifth century BC. Fifth- century data may well be hidden below the better- preserved, indeed, better-quality materials of the Late Classical to Early Hellenistic civic centres. The post- Persian period in northern Greece, and the era of the Peloponnesian wars, was a politically troubled one. Yet it was also an important phase in the crystallization of Macedonian political power, as it was for the Odrysian Kingdom in Thrace. The second half of the fifth and the first half of the fourth centuries are periods well repre- sented in the Thracian interior and at many coastal and inland locations of Aegean Thrace (notably at Amphipolis), and the Chalcidic peninsula. Future reports will be on the lookout for evidence that may help to account for this apparent gap in lowland and upland Macedonia. Hellenistic Continuing investigations at the ancient Macedonian capital of Pella provide some of the most significant findings of the last year for the region as a whole (see Lilibaki-Akamati [2009] for a summary of work during the last decade). Excavators of the main civic centre have before them a set of formidable challenges. The ancient capital is located within an expanding modern civic area. The construction of a bypass around the ancient civic centre has also meant major rescue excavation in the western area of ancient Pella. Excavation in advance of development work has revealed details of the extent of the circuit wall, the main east-west arterial routes and a Hellenistic cemetery succeeded by a Roman and post- Roman/Early Christian one (ID485). Investigation of the southern parts of the ancient city have provided a long sequence of deposits, providing significant insights into the later history of Pella after the earthquake of 90 BC, with the rebuilding of parts of the urban footprint in the later first or first half of the second century (see further below). During the last five years, investigators have continued to make systematic progress in understanding the devel- opment of the Hellenistic city of Pella, with interventions in various sectors (see ID373); further exploration of the east side of the agora, with well-preserved storage and/or retail facilities in the east portico (ID485), and, at some distance from the civic centre, the discovery of a potter's workshop with evidence of production activity over a hundred years (ID819). Nor has the royal palace been neglected, where investigations have continued in the palaestra (Building V; ID1147). Among the most remarkable discoveries has been the recovery of what seems to be the city's principal administrative archive in buildings on the southwest corner of the agora (ID819). Traces of an important Early Bronze Age cemetery immediately below the street system were discovered in 1997, at the same time as those of a public bath complex (ID486). Alongside the enormous range of important, indeed exceptional, new evidence from Pella, the prelim- inary report on a set of public baths, within the residential area of the city, deserves special prominence (ID2233). The data published so far deserve to be considered in some detail. The evidence for the baths consists principally of wall foundations; one row of the superstructure has survived in one area only. However, fixtures, drainage and flooring materials provide important additional information for the phasing and character of this complex. It occupied the whole north side of a single insula, an area of 563.5m2. Three separate phases have been identified: phase 1, starting in the final quarter of the fourth century BC, when the complex consisted of a swimming pool, a variety of associated rooms and an open court; phase 2, beginning in the second quarter of the third century BC, when a series of graduated heated constructions seems to have been installed, alongside individual bath tubs; and phase 3, initiated in the final quarter of the second century BC, when underfloor heating was introduced and a plan closer to that familiar from Roman bathing establishments.</page><page sequence="94">94 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD In phase 1, the complex consisted of a suite of rooms around a central court, 14m long on one side. There may have been porticoes along the western and southern sides of this court (Fig. 139). Entry seems to have been from the north side only, where there is a threshold slab in place. A rectangular swimming pool (7.5 x 4m), constructed of large masonry slabs and lined with hydraulic cement, was located on the western wing. An overflow tank allowed the water level to be kept constant, while a shallow basin in the northeast angle allowed excess water to be decanted. On the eastern wing was a rectangular rock-cut cistern, which collected rainwater, adjacent to an open area (perhaps an apodyterion). Water was supplied by a system of terracotta pipes, from the road on the east side of the bath complex, which linked the baths to the civic water supply through a device in the centre of the courtyard. 139. Pella: foundations of the public bath complex in phase 1. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 17th EPCA. Phase 2 involved the transformation of the northern and eastern wings (Fig. 140). The suite of rooms in the northern wing was replaced (except for the room at the far northwestern end), by an elongated room, 9 x 4m, with a circular construction at its eastern end (4.9m in diameter). At least two suites of individual clay hip baths, of which three are preserved intact, were located within the circular room (Fig. 141) and in a rectangular enclosure to the south of it. The floor between these features consisted of pebbles set in hydraulic mortar. A plug for filling the baths was located on the left of the entrance and a conduit for evacuating waste water on the south side. There was a bench against the wall behind the baths. In the eastern wing, the rooms of phase 1 were replaced by a large tripartite suite (14.5 x 5m), with a vestibule at the eastern end. The northern and southern ends were paved with pebbles in hydraulic mortar, with marble veneering in the central space. Benches separated the three interior spaces. Entrance to the baths was thus shifted to the eastern wing in phase 2, via this tripartite suite, leading into the baths on the northern wing through a corridor. The excavators believe that the circular feature was a hot bath, the rectan- gular space (with the hip baths) a tepid dip and the swimming pool (on the west wing) a cold dip. The final phase of the bath complex corresponds to the layout discovered in 1997 (Fig. 142). Underfloor heating was introduced along an east-west axis, with the heated chamber (2.2 x lm) at the far eastern end, underneath what had been the tripartite suite, preceded by a vestibule on the western side and a closed conduit 0.4m wide and 11m long, accessed from the western end of this axis. The bath complex was thus reorganized to correspond more closely to the Roman convention, with the hot rooms now located on the east side, where a brick-built pool with sides lm in diameter replaced part of the previous tripartite suite. The rectangular room with the hip baths now became the tepid room; the hip baths in the circular room were covered by a floor made up of broken tile (this is interpreted by the excavators as a laconicum). The swimming pool on the western wing retained its function as a cold pool. The discovery of the bath complex at Pella is bound to attract cultural and social historians. The function of the different suites, and the organization of hot and cold rooms, is likely to elicit considerable discussion. The identification of a circular heated room as a laconicum is one point of interest. In his recent review of the mutual exchange of ideas between Greek and Roman traditions with respect to gymnasia, baths and their various cultural associations, Andrew Wallace Hadrill writes: 140.

Pella: public bath complex in phase 3. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 17th EPCA. Roman baths thus emerge not as contrast to, but an evolution from Greek gymnasia. Moreover, the Romans valued and indeed advertised the associations with Greek gymnastics. The neatest illustration of this is the laconicum. It is the one element which Vitruvius prescribes for both the Roman baths and the Greek palaestra. In fact it represents a temporary phase in building fashion, belonging to the last two centuries BC. There is remarkably little evidence for it from the Greek side, whether archaeologically for the charac- teristic circular domed room which is found in Roman contexts, or epigraphically for the word ' lakdnikoii (Wallace-Hadrill [2008] 179-81). He goes on to discuss the specific associations, within a Roman cultural context, of the laconicum with the Spartans. The baths at Pella provide a rather different perspective, not least because they seem to reveal a tradition of civic bathing, using a mixed regime of temper- atures, with oiling and washing procedures in sequence (the excavations produced large quantities of unguentaria and lamps), probably connected with athletic activity. There is clearly scope for further investigation of bathing practices in the north. Most of the excavated remains in the civic centre of Dion belong to the city's later history (see Piniatoglou [2009]), but recent investigation of levels below the forum, both in new trenches on the south side and on the forum's northwest side, have revealed constructions belonging to the city's Hellenistic phase. On the south side, there are traces of substantial masonry, including a defensive wall aligned north-south, as well as plastered walls, pottery and coins from the time of Philip II onwards. On the northwest, a series of deposits, which have not yet been closely dated, has been revealed. These constitute several building horizons, with stone walls and unfired brick in the lower deposits. A more nuanced dating is beginning to emerge for the different phases of construction at the Temple of Zeus Ammon, at Kallithea (ancient Aphytis). Earlier investiga- tions of this remarkable and ambitious cult complex (Fig. 143) have identified different building phases by organ- izing the architectural members into a consecutive sequence, with the first phase (identified as having a limestone entablature and a roof of Corinthian tiles) belonging to the second half of the fourth century BC (Misailidou-Despotidou [2009]). A second phase, immediately succeeding the restoration following a destruction around the turn of the fourth/beginning of the third century BC (with a marble entablature and new Corinthian tiles), was followed by a Roman restoration, this time with Lakonian tiles. A proposition that does not seem to be in doubt is the abandonment of the temple at the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century AD. Soundings made in 2007 suggest that the different forms of tile co-existed from an early phase in the sanctuary's history. Much remains to be elucidated about the site's detailed topographic history. The temple, and its associated buildings, succeeded a 143.

An elaborate fountain was constructed to channel water from the cave during the first half of the fourth century BC (Fig. 144). Underground channels diverted the natural spring into a basin, surrounded by a powerful wall which is still preserved to a height of 2m. One of the two openings in this basin poured into a marble basin. The bathing complex dates from the Imperial period (see below). A rescue excavation at Koukos, west of Pydna, has produced an exceptionally rich male burial, identified as belonging to a senior Macedonian officer, judging by his weapons, which include an iron sword with a hilt decorated with gold leaf (Fig. 145; ID2153), several spear- heads and traces of a bow. He was accompanied by a gilded bronze crown, a red-figure bell krater and other pottery. Of special interest is a gaming board, with 52 glass and five bone pieces. Most of the 24 burials in Sector B of the eastern cemetery of Aiani investigated during 2007 (and reported in 2011) belonged to the third and second centuries BC, though some go back to the fourth century. They attest to the general level of prosperity in the region of Kozani during the Hellenistic period.

Other women's burials contained silver omega-shaped earrings with snake-head terminals, unguentaria, ceramic vessels and terracotta figurines, including at least one pigeon (Fig. 146). Men's burials were accompanied by a spearhead and occasional other items, including an odd vessel made from an unusual alloy of copper and lead (T192; Fig. 147), also known in at least one female grave (T8a). Contemporary burials are also recorded at Kozani and Vergina. Roman Rescue work and systematic investigation of major urban sites is continuing to provide a wide range of data on the Roman presence in Macedonia and on different kinds of development under Roman rule. In Thessaloniki, devel- opment work in connection with the city's new metro line is revealing a good deal more about the Late Roman and Early Byzantine expansion of the urban centre and its extra-mural cemeteries, particularly the large eastern necropolis. Development in connection with the southern bypass around Edessa has revealed a number of rural properties, including one near Psili Vrissi, destroyed in the early third century, and a second, on the southeastern side of the city, which was longer lasting, in close proximity to the Archaic, Classical and Early Hellenistic cemetery already noted. 146.

The Sebasteion, or sanctuary dedicated to the cult of the emperor, was identified in 2004-2005. A complete history of the cult building can be reconstructed. It was dedicated in AD 86 by one Flavia Mysta and her children; an inscription recording the act was found just outside the building, whilst a female portrait head inside Room T has been identified as that of the dedicatee. Fragments of an over-life-size statue of Augustus and a portrait head resem- bling the Prima Porta type were recovered from the same room, along with architectural fragments, including a base for multiple statues, which was located on the far wall (ID394). The complex consists of a series of adjacent rooms which share a back wall and do not inter-commu- nicate, each interior having a doorway facing east. The two earliest rooms (A and B) pre-date the foundation of the cult. Room B was adapted with a bench to support statues, whilst Rooms T and A are lm larger than the others. Rooms A and E contained TT-shaped benches, and the presence of this feature, along with numerous ceramic fragments, suggests that these rooms were used as banqueting suites (the citizens of Kalindoia celebrated such banquets in honour of Zeus and the emperor, according to an honorific decree). A lime kiln at the back of Room A, dating to the third century, indicates that the cult came to an end in this phase and various architectural pieces as well as statuary were destined for destruction. Room E has since been identified as the city's bouleu- terion on the basis of another inscription according to which an exedra, the bouleuterion and a stoa were dedicated by Arridaios and Kotys, sons of Sopatros, and Sopatros, son of Kotys (ID590). Recent work has extended excavation southwards, where a further chamber (Room Zt) was revealed, as well as an open area, space Z, which has been identified, on the basis of its overall form, several stylobate blocks and a mass of associated marble statue fragments, as the exedra referred to in the last inscription (Fig. 148). A statue base, 1.1m high and investigated to a length of 6.5m, was located along the western wall of space Z, and contained niches, in front of which the following fragmentary statues were found, as well as fragments of a large honorific inscription in favour of the gymnasiarch of Kalindoia (first-century AD): two small headless male figures of near-identical form, wearing the himation and holding rolled documents (Fig. 149; ID2274); an over-life- size statue of a woman (in the style of the Small Herculaneum type; Fig. 150); two male portrait heads, a small female portrait head and a headless seated cult figure of Cybele. A head of Meleager, identified in 2006, has been connected with a number of sculptural fragments in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. In 2010 two further portrait heads were recovered, one of which belongs to the statue of Augustus discovered in 1961 (Fig. 151); the other, a fine bronze head, is perhaps the portrait of a local magistrate (ID2144). At Aphytos a farm complex was discovered northeast of the Late Classical cemetery, consisting of a central room with smaller rooms opening off it on three sides and a potter's kiln in one of the rooms on the southwest corner. A pot-hoard containing 67 coins of Gordian III (AD 238-244) may be connected with the destruction of the 148.

A coin of Kassandreia, contemporary with Domitian's reign (AD 81-96), found in a foundation trench for one of the principal walls, provides a terminus post quern for the farm's construction. Reinvestigation of the water channel connecting the natural source in the cave adjoining the Sanctuary of Zeus Ammon to the temple shows that the temple steps, belonging to the second- to third-century phase, put this channel out of action. The bathing complex investigated since 2005 (ID403) that developed between the second and fourth centuries AD was connected to the water source. It is not yet clear how this was managed in the intervening period, but the Late Classical to Early Hellenistic fountain was renovated and a brick cistern added to it, lined with hydraulic mortar. Of at least equal interest is the site's redevelopment after the temple went out of use, with the addition of a water mill, composed of a vertical wheel on a horizontal axle fixed to two cavities in the rock (Fig. 152). Close by is a chamber containing a smaller wheel which operated two horizontal mill stones. The water mill was installed in the second half or towards the end of the fourth century AD.</page><page sequence="98">98 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD 150.

The potential of archaeology in Thrace is illustrated in rescue work at Lithochori, on the west bank of the river Nestos, in proximity to the Egnatia Odos (E90) extension. A rural establishment was discovered, including a courtyard complex, in use between the late first or early second century until the fourth century AD, as well as a cemetery to the northwest of it with a much longer history (fifth century BC to fourth century AD, with an inter- ruption between the third century BC and first century AD). In 2006, 20 burials were recovered, of which 14 were human burials, including five cremations; four were intact horse burials and two included human individuals with horses. Three human burials belonged to the fifth 151. Kalindoia: marble head of Augustus from a portrait statue in the exedra outside the Sebasteion. © Ministry of Culture and Tourism: 16th EPCA. 152.

Of particular interest, however, was the discovery of a horse- drawn vehicle, with bronze and iron parts preserved. The vehicle itself is decorated with relief bronze panels, imitating an architectural facade with a Doric frieze and figured metopes (second half of the first century AD). Where dateable, the remaining burials fall between the late first or early second century and the first quarter of the third century, apart from one later grave from the fourth century. Among the outstanding individual finds was an iron chair with bronze ornaments in relief. The excavation was completed in 2007 with the recovery of nine more burials, one human and eight of horses, together with the foundations of a rectangular, single-roomed building. The horses were disposed in pairs (tombs T26 and T27) close to the vehicles to which they would have been harnessed. The other horses were treated as auxiliary mounts, buried close by. At least one of these was buried in a horizontal position, with the head raised and laid against the umbo of a shield (Fig. 153) inscribed in Latin RCATO (stamp identifying the workshop) and a second inscription in pointille script, T-GAISITA (identifying the owner's name, T.

There can be no attempt at an encyclopaedic assessment of activity (even if it were desirable), and on this occasion justice cannot be done to the burgeoning archaeological explo- ration of Frankish Greece or to Byzantine numismatics and sigillography. Feeding or reflecting on some of the new developments are some significant publications and potentially significant recent conferences (published and unpublished), which deserve to be considered in their own right. In reviewing the current state of this archaeology in Greece (or these 'archaeologies', see below), it might be useful to draw attention to some of its/their specific circumstances. First, important external stimuli, both traditional and new, have helped to shape post-Roman archaeological research and its priorities in Greece (as elsewhere), including 'Christian' archaeology, the development of a national heritage and (not unrelated to the former) 'rescue archaeology'. Secondly, a growing engagement with archaeology among Byzantinists over the last 40 years or so is itself a source of ideas and stimulus. Thirdly, whatever one may think about the absence or under- developed state of a body of theory for Late Roman and Byzantine archaeology (such as that which, for instance, drove many of the intensive interdisciplinary surveys conducted in Greece), the very absence of this 'body' makes external stimuli, for better or for worse, very important as drivers. There are latent, but still ineffec- tually articulated, disagreements about the conceptual framework (therefore logical strategies) for an archae- ology of 'post-Roman' Greece which appear in relevant conference proceedings (for which see below). Late Roman Greece and the transition to Medieval Byzantium (ca. AD 300-800): excavations and surveys Turning first to significant achievements in excavations and surveys, and to some challenges affecting them, it will be useful to consider separately the archaeologies of Late Roman Greece plus the 'Dark- Age' transition, from the archaeology of Medieval Byzantine Greece, partly because of current differences in the tempo and scale of research and publication of their respective findings, and partly because of significant differences between the respective archaeologies. Many interesting factors underlie the differences between these two endeavours, which have long tended to be distinct specialisms, and one of these differences should be mentioned at this point, namely the traditional impact of 'Christian' archaeology upon the archaeology of Late Antiquity in Greece. The recent documentation of several kiln sites and/or areas of production for Late Roman amphorae (for example, on Crete), and for plain and coarse domestic wares, together with the recent documentation of Greek sites and/or areas of production for Late Roman lamps (for example, Athens) and glass (for example, Thessaloniki), will encourage further progress in the characterization of Late Roman sites and settlement patterns, and more widely the characterization of economic and cultural changes. The documentation of Greek regional imitations of several common Mediterranean amphora types (LRA1, LRA2, LRA 13) and of lamps, as well as of regional plain or coarse domestic wares from excavations (for example, at Gortyn and Delphi) and surveys alike (for example, the Boeotia Survey), also facilitates new ways of characterizing Late Roman occupation vis-a-vis Roman occupation in both excavations and surveys, both urban and rural. The first systematic publication of Late Roman pottery from sites in Macedonia provides case-studies relevant to many of these themes (Malamidou [2005]). These developments take the interpretation of sites' functionality, and the relationship of sites to Late Roman socio-economic struc- tures, to a new level, for instance in the first part of the final report of the British Academy's Boeotian Survey (Bintliff et al [2006]). This is not a criticism of more circumspect interpretations of rural surveys, such as Liverpool University's Methana Survey, but an obser- vation that increasing recognition of sites, or regions, for the production of all classes of Late Roman pottery, and the mapping of these findings onto an evolving settlement pattern in which villae, 'estates', 'hamlets' and 'farms' are recognized, ushers in a new phase of research into the history of the Late Roman countryside in the east Mediterranean. Here, studies based upon Egyptian and Palestinian papyri, monuments, economic installations and epigraphy, and studies based on the intensive rural surveys (for which Greece together with Cyprus are probably still the most significant arenas) must pay very close attention to each other. Meanwhile, however, as case-studies of complete and representative Late Roman (and even Medieval Byzantine) settlement patterns, intensive surveys still remain inadequate for a number of reasons (see below for a new generalized critique of the current relationship between Late Roman archaeology and history, with particular reference to Greece). Meanwhile, a methodologically complementary critique of Greek rural surveys' simple counts of 'diagnostic' sherds has been field-tested by the East Korinthia Archaeological Survey and other projects in Greece and Cyprus, and makes the case that the Roman presence in the Greek countryside has been consistently underestimated (Pettegrew [2007; 2008]). The parabola of a Late Roman 'surge' would, on such a basis, be reduced. If the findings of these revisions were to be accepted, then both Romanists and Late Romanists will need to rethink their inferences about the demographic trajectory, and about non-demographic factors (for example, fiscal ones) that could affect the 'ceramic landscapes', which form the basis for interpretation of intensive survey data. This inevitably requires close study of the history of Late Roman Greece and a re-evaluation of the brave attempt made in this direction by Cynthia Kosso (in relation to surveys conducted in the area of the province of Achaea) (Kosso [2003]). The 'End of Antiquity' (as a sub-phase of Late Antiquity whose temporal boundaries shift across geographical space) is a significant subject of archaeo- logical enquiry in the Greek- Aegean space which has been</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 101 making waves since the 1930s. It also merges with the archaeology of the transition to a Medieval Byzantine habitus and is being brought into increasingly sharp focus by the recognition of seventh- to ninth-century pottery (coarse, plain and decorated). Exploration of the seventh- to ninth-century transition (traditionally the Byzantine 'Dark Age') has recently been stepped up. This devel- opment now enables a close dialogue with specialists in the Balkans (for example, in the new project under the aegis of the Ecole frangaise d'Athenes concerning the 'Komani-Kruja Culture', which links together research in Albania, Greece and F.Y.R.O.M.). Progress in the recog- nition of seventh-century and eighth-century amphorae from kiln sites on Crete and Kos, and/or areas of production on Crete, also has the potential of bringing archaeologists into dialogue with historians (as yet undeveloped). A spate of recent articles, by A. Yangaki (2006), Ch. Diamanti (2010), N. Poulou-Papadimitriou and S. Didioumi (2010) discuss sites and areas of amphora production on Crete and at Halasarna (modern Kardamaina) on Kos. When writing about the Koan sites the authors tacitly disagree about their chronology: between a mid sixth- to early seventh-century floruit and a seventh- to eighth-century floruit. When writing about the Cretan sites, there is agreement that amphora production continued on the island through the seventh and eighth centuries. But all agree that some of this production, which is characterized by great homogeneity of design, despite increasing dispersal and down-scaling (relative to Late Roman levels of production), should be connected with the Byzantine state's interventions in the economy. The nature and extent of these interventions are the subject of continuing debate among Byzantinists, which cannot even be summarized here, but the fact that a Koan amphora of this period is stamped before firing (as opposed to receiving dipinti or sgraffito inscriptions after firing) and stamped with a title ( endoxotatos ; Latin glorio- sissimus) in the genitive that was held by very high fiscal officials in the seventh century is strongly indicative of fiscal intervention in amphora production and control of their contents. This remarkable, and now well- documented, continuity of amphora production through the transitional era in Greece is part of a complex picture of contrasts across the Greek- Aegean space. The recently published mid sixth- to early seventh- century kilns of Delphi (Petrides [2010]) are an excellent case-study of a widespread phenomenon, namely the end of production of high-quality pottery in many regions during the seventh century. The current excavations of Gortyn, one of the most important for the study of this period in the Byzantine world, document the survival through the eighth century of a Late Roman provincial painted domestic pottery tradition. But Gortyn looks like an exception, albeit an interesting and instructive one, to the trend across Greece (Fig. 154). These are a few of the highlights in the archaeology of the period ca. AD 300-800, illustrating its potential value for the study of a period and area (Greece) about which relatively few non-epigraphic texts speak in any detail. 154.

It is not realistic to discuss either Frankish Greece or numismatics in this first report. Many excellent general studies, addressing a wider public, regularly appear under the imprint of T An A. The period is given less than two pages in the recently published first volume of the Boeotian Survey (Bintliff et al [2006] 166-67). Among the excep- tions are two valuable syntheses of the work of the 12th Ephoreia of Byzantine Antiquities (eastern Macedonia and, until recently, western Thrace) concerning western Thrace. R. Ousterhout and Ch. Bakirtzis (2007) present the Ephoreia 's work in the context of the Byzantine archae- ology of Turkish Thrace. D. Papanikola-Bakirtzi and N. Zikos (2007) present the finewares from kilns or areas of production, Middle Byzantine and Late Byzantine, in western Thrace. Art and architecture as such cannot be considered in this first report, but most readers will not be surprised to learn that there are plenty of new develop- ments and important publications under those headings. Some recent conferences, proceedings, series and festschrifts A number of recent academic publications illustrate other important developments in the Late Roman and Byzantine archaeology of Greece, and in some of these the later centuries are more prominent than they are currently in the domain of the monograph and the final report. One notable development is the significant presence of Greek material, and of Greek specialists, at the two major confer- ences dedicated to the pottery of the Late Roman and subsequent eras around the Mediterranean, Late Roman Coarse Wares ; Cooking Wares and Amphorae in the Mediterranean. Archaeology and Archaeometry (LRCW 4) and La ceramique medieval en Mediterranee (CERAMM). The former event was held at the University of Thessaloniki in April 2011, and included 18 papers about Greek sites, or Greek distributions of particular wares, or the wider distributions of wares now identified as originating in the Greek- Aegean space. The seventh Congress of the Medieval series was held in Thessaloniki in 1999 and the ninth was held in Venice in 2010. Also within these last few years, in 2006, the Archaeological Institute for Macedonian and Thracian Studies organized the first comprehensive conference dedicated exclusively to the burgeoning Late Roman ceramic material from Greek excavations, material which was effectively contex- tualized by the speakers and is now published (Papanikola-Bakirtzi and Kousoulakou [2010]). In these important ways, Greek material becomes properly integrated into the wider Late Roman assemblage. The very broad front along which the archaeologies of Late Roman and Byzantine Greece advance is meanwhile better represented by recent festschrifts and the published proceedings of the conference Medieval and Post- medieval Greece. The Corfu Papers (Bintliff and Stoger [2009]). The volume in honour of Professor Nikos Nikonanos (Nikonanos Festschrift) includes no less than 38 papers concerning Byzantine archaeology and art history (though primarily the latter) in which members of the Archaeological Service and the universities of Greece present and interpret monuments both religious and secular in ways that continue to be of undoubted value. Much of this work is based upon the never-ending require- ments and discoveries of heritage management, and its careful publication is a constant source of useful material. There is also one excellent example of the forensic confrontation of Byzantine manorial archives with archae- ology, which is especially possible across northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace), namely the reidentification by N. Zikos of the 'Pyrgos tis Apollonias' (Karyani, Nomos Kavalas) in the Athonite archives. These types of identifi- cations, and their accompanying archaeological projects, are a vast collective long-term effort (in which your contributor is also engaged at Thisve [Kastorion]), and work to the substantial mutual benefit of both archaeology and history. Your contributor is constantly amazed by airy statements made by archaeologists (including one in the festschrift for Professor Tim Gregory) to the effect that 'Greece lacks Byzantine archives'. Not only are there many, but their value is widely transferable beyond their topographic points of reference. The volume in honour of Professor Gregory (Caraher et al. [2008]) illustrates a rigorous new reflection on the techniques and interpretation of multi-period Greek field surveys and its implications for the parabola of Late Roman 'expansion'; the value of a long-term commitment to a major urban excavation (that of Corinth) and to the study of its chora ; the Byzantine construction of 'sacred landscapes'; and some of the challenges of the confrontation of texts and archaeology. Medieval and Post-medieval Greece. The Corfu Papers (Bintliff and Stoger [2009]) illustrates most comprehensively the breadth of the front along which the archaeology of post- Roman Greece now advances: the mutually advantageous collaborations with environmental archaeologists (two projects); the combination of Medieval Byzantine with post-Byzantine archaeology and with historical enquiry (most projects); the articulation of the role and impact of cultural forces, such as those that have shaped 'Christian' archaeology (in the contribution of W. Bowden); and the importance of region- wide 'extensive' surveys for the comprehension of post-Roman settlement patterns (for example, the Aetolia Survey). However, discussion of the broader conceptual framework is still generally underde- veloped, and therefore the value of the application of 'theory' to the raw data has yet to be demonstrated. Applications of Central Place Theory (for example, by J. Koder) and of ideas involving 'Cultural Memory' could have been cited and evaluated, as could the impact of the 'Annales School' and the impact (good and bad) of historical materialism on eastern European Byzantine archaeology. The attempt, albeit rather unsatisfactory, to apply a 'body of theory' to the post-Roman findings of the first intensive survey in Greece (the Melos Survey of 1974-1977) should definitely have been cited! The actual complexity of many Byzantine archaeologists' engage- ments with history (and its theories) and with archaeo- logical, geographical and cultural concepts, deserved to be acknowledged. In short, there has, as yet, been no clear demonstration of the superiority, let alone viability, of an alternative approach to those that are being rather tenta- tively developed. So the present reflection should be seen as a summons to a more rigorous discussion.</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2010-2011 103 Meanwhile, data from pure research, rescue archae- ology (see Figs. 155, 156) and basic heritage management keeps on accumulating. A related development that is positive for regional archaeology, but at the same time challenging for libraries and calling for endless vigilance by all students, is the publication by the Ephoreias of Byzantine Antiquities of their own bulletins and databases (so far mostly in hard copy, but at least one is on DVD). The 9th EBA (Thessaloniki and Central Macedonia) publishes TerpaSia ApxaioAoyias , which began to appear in 2000, and has aspects of what is familiar to field officers as a 'Sites and Monuments Record' whilst also including the collections of historic churches. Volume 5 is a substantial work of reference (at 650 pages) about the monuments of the Nomoi of Thessaloniki, Kilkis and Pieria. Volume 6 (2010) by C. Striker concerns dendrochronology and its contribution to Byzantine studies. The Aegean Dendrochronology Project has collected many samples in Greece. The 10th EBA (covering the Chalkidiki) publishes an annual bulletin on its work, H Aek&amp;tt /, which remains ahead of ADelt. Volume 2 covers the years 2005-2006 and volume 3 is in press. Parts of the text are bilingual, in Greek and English, and every activity of the Ephoreia (excavation, planning, restoration and conservation) is illustrated by informative high-quality colour images. The bulk of these bulletins (which can reach almost 100 pages) is devoted to longer reports than could ever be accommodated in ADelt. The 12th EBA (now eastern Macedonia) publishes an occasional series of reports on its major projects (such as the 14th-century fortress at Pythio, Byzantine Empythion, in the Nomos Evrou, and the Byzantino-Ottoman aqueduct of Kavala), a series which does not include the two works about western Thrace mentioned already. The reader will note that while I have only been able to refer to three Ephoreias so far, this is a significant, but highly dispersed publishing activity, which makes available both raw data and an intermediate level of report between the provisional and the final. 155.
