Miller Department Department of Modern and Classical Languages, University University of Connecticut, 337 Mansfield Road, Unit 1057, Storrs, CT 06269, USA stuart.stuart. miller @uconn. edu Abstract The interpretation of archaeological finds in light of Talmudic evidence has often resulted in simplistic, "one-to-one" correlations that distort our understanding of "Judaism" in Graeco-Roman Palestine. This is especially true of "stepped pools" and stone vessels which, when seen as markers of Jewish ethnicity, need to be understood with the biblical tradition in mind. Biblical notions of purity and holiness further enable us to appreciate the persistence of ritual purity practices after 70 C.E. The subsequent efforts of the rabbis to regulate such practices, espe daily those pertaining to sexuality and the household, reflect the tenacity of bib lical perceptions of purity and holiness especially among commoners, who had their own understanding of their significance. Once it is realized that the bound aries between Jews were not strictly drawn, material finds can be better assessed, and rabbinic Judaism can be properly understood as having evolved out of a bib lically derived, "complex common Judaism."

By avoiding the creation of a fourth map corresponding to the "beliefs" of Judaism, Satlow sidesteps the issue of assigning specific meanings to identifiable practices. Satlow admits that Jewish communities might share basic beliefs pertaining to God, Torah, and Israel, but he concludes, "the move from the conceptual categories to more specific beliefs is by no means uniform, linear, or predictable."1 This challenge in defining and describing "Judaism" is readily apparent when we turn to the situation in Late Antique 'Erez, Israel. Talmudic sources often assign structure and meaning to pre-existing practices. Nev ertheless, as material finds and critical examination of the rabbinic corpus indicate, many popular observances were not in sync with the approaches of the rabbis, who often sought to regulate, ritualize, and define them.2 Individual Jewish "commoners" and the communities to which they belonged may have been selective in their approach to the views of the rabbis or even ignorant of them, which explains the evident diversity in practice, and the discrepancy as to which rituals, or aspects of a ritual, were emphasized in real life.3 In short, rituals have a life of their own. As Ithamar Gruenwald has pointed out, already within the Tanakh, rituals are sometimes prescribed in an inconsistent fashion.4 This, of course, led to variations in practice in ״״ Michael Satlow, Creating Judaism: History, Tradition, Practice (New York: Columbia University Press, 2006), 9. Satlow borrows from Jonathan Smith in "mapping" Judaism and seeing it in "polythetic" terms. See Jonathan Smith, "Fences and Neighbors: Some Contours of Early Judaism," in Approaches to Ancient Judaism: V0L 2 (ed. J. Neusner; Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1980), 1-25. Cf. Michael Satlow, "Beyond Influence: Toward a a New Historiographic Paradigm," in Jewish Literatures and Cultures: Context and Intercon text text (ed. A. Norich and Υ. Z. Eliav; BJS 349; Providence, R.I.: Brown University, 2008), 37-53, esp. 51. 2) Here and below I expand upon and further adapt what Satlow says to the specific period under discussion. 31 Cf. Satlow, Creating Judaism·. History, Tradition, Practice, 13, 289, who builds on Haym Soloveitchik's insistence that rituals can have an existence independent of texts. Satlow notes with regard to Judaism throughout the ages that canonical texts represented but one manifestation of "tradition." A "set of practices" that may not be fully or accurately reflected in these texts or are even unknown to them constitute yet another tradition. Such traditions belonged to "real historical communities." Cf. Haym Soloveitchik, "Rupture and Reconstruction: The Transformation of Contemporary Orthodoxy," Tradition 28:4 (1994): 64-130. 41 41 See Ithamar Gruenwald, Rituals and Ritual Theory in Ancient Israel (Leiden: Brill, 2003), 173 n. 60, where he provides as an example the description of the Festival of Booths.</page><page sequence="3">216 S.

This is not only evident when the rabbis critique the practices of commoners, but also on those occasions when they have difficulty arriving at a halakah. Remarkably, on some of these occasions, the sages order their disciples to "go and see what the community is doing, and do accordingly"—צא וראה מה הציבור נוהג ונהוג—expressly deferring their decision making until local practice is ascertained.7 At other times, an individual sage may invoke the practice of his own or of some other "household," thereby granting those who belonged to the domus an important role in the halakic process.8 We need to pay attention to these variations in ritual expression when we assess the relationship between the texts and material finds that are 51 Again, see Gruenwald, who speaks of "layers of stratification."

In her book, The Archaeology of Ethnicity,Ethnicity, Sian Jones critiques the earlier writing of "culture-history," in which "archaeological cultures" are reconstructed by correlating finds with known ethnic groups.9 Jones draws on Pierre Bourdieu's theory of habitus, according to which one's background and experiences, that is, their "dis position," interact with the situation in which one finds oneself, which then prompts some form of adaptation.10 An understanding of the social context of groups is, therefore, essential for appreciating whether or not there was a need for them to express their identity, and, if so, what form that expression would take. For Jones, ethnic identification is "highly variable" and frequently results in "overlapping ethnic boundaries."11 Jones, therefore, emphasizes the challenges that archaeologists face in attempting to recover the ideas and motivations represented by their finds.12 Fortunately, Jones moves beyond her theoretical discussion in an article devoted to "an Archaeological Perspective on Jewish Identity in Antiquity."13 91 See, Sian Jones, The Archaeology of Ethnicity, Constructing Identities in the Past and the Present Present (London: Routledge, 1997), 15-29. Jones, 5-6, 106-10, considers at length the "New Archaeology," now known as "processual archaeology," which rejects this monolithic perspective but results in rather vague or crude groupings and classifications. Jones also points out, 10-11, the problems with the most recent, "post-processual" reaction to "cul ture-history," which has led to the questioning of the existence of bounded, monolithic ethnic groups altogether. On processual and post-processual archaeology, see B. G. Trig ger, A History of Archaeological Thought (2d ed.; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 386-483. 10) Jones, The Archaeology of Ethnicity, 88-90. Jones, The Archaeology of Ethnicity, 128-29, further explains that these boundaries "are at once transient, but also subject to reproduction and transformation in the ongoing pro cesses of social life." 121 See, The Archaeology of Ethnicity, 124, where Jones notes, "archaeologists do not have direct direct access to peoples ideas and perceptions." She cites Bruce G. Trigger, "Comments on Archaeological Classification and Ethnic Groups," Norwegian Archaeological Review 10 (1977): 20-23, who discusses the challenges archaeologists face in extracting ideas, as opposed to behavioral patterns, from their finds. See, more recently, Trigger, A History of Archaeological Archaeological Thought, 507-8. Cf.

In her book, Jones periodically considers the Romanization of Britain and warns against simplistic categorizations such as Roman vs. native, but she is largely occu pied with theory.

Miller / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 214-243 All too often, she insists, various ethnic markers are identified, leading to the assigning of fixed, "one-to-one" correlations between specific groups known from literary sources and various material styles.14 Finds are then typed into neat categories, for example, as "Hellenistic" or "Roman," "Jewish," or "Hellenized/Romanized Jewish." It is unlikely, however, that material indicators of acculturation "represent a straightforward change in, or loss of, identity."15 Rather, Jewish identity was in a constant state of definition.16 This is precisely the reason that a few decades ago scholars had diffi culty characterizing Second Temple Period Judaism, with some siding with Jacob Neusner that there were many, discrete Judaisms and others preferring Ed Sanders' notion of a "common Judaism."17 It is also why I more fruitful area for examination, since the extremely varied archaeological remains leave the impression that "local patterns of habitus... changed over time." As we shall presently see, in the article under discussion, Jones turns her attention to Jewish identity in the Diaspora and in Palestine, which proved to be an equally splendid example of the chal lenges in studying ethnicities. 141 Jones, The Archaeology of Ethnicity, 134, 139-40. Cf. Martin Pitts, "The Emperors New Clothes? The Utility of Identity in Roman Archaeology," AJA 111 (2007): 693-713. See, too, the interesting methodology adopted by Karen B. Stem, Inscribing Devotion and Death:Death: Archaeological Evidence for Jewish Populations of North Africa (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2008), especially her discussion, 37-40, of "monodirectional" understandings of "influ ence" and "assimilation." Stern prefers the use of "culture" with its "vague, expansive and inclusive properties" and follows Peter van Dommelen in using "cultural identity" for honing in on the experiences of individuals within a larger cultural milieu. Cf. Peter van Dommelen, "Punic Persistence, Colonialism and Cultural Identities in Roman Sardinia," in Cultural Identity in the Roman Empire (ed. R. Laurence and J. Berry; London: Rout ledge, 2001), 25-48, esp. 26. With regard to North Africa, Stern cautiously notes that we cannot always take for granted that a one-to-one relationship between complex artifacts and complex humans existed, but often there is a "correlation." See her "Limitations of 'Jewish' as a Label in Roman North Africa," JSJ39 (2008): 307-36. 131 Jones, "Identities in Practice," 34, argues that a specific groups identity is unlikely to be "monolithic or homogeneous." She further asserts, "archaeological material is still attributed a particular identity in a monolithic and fixed fashion" (37) and maintains that it is doubt ful that we will find "a particular ethnic or religious group represented by a discrete, uni form pattern of particular types of material culture in the archaeological record" (39). 161 Jones is true to her earlier theoretical statement in which she draws upon the proces sual and post-processual schools' critiques of archaeological cultures (cf. above n. 9), as monothetic, easily defined, fixed, and bounded ethnic groupings.

Where Neusner sees diversity and Sanders wishes to discern a common denominator, I wish to draw attention to both and, simultaneously, to emphasize that when we overly-focus on dis tinct sects and groups, we overlook components and inter-relationships that cannot be categorized. While we may speak of a biblically negotiated koine koine koine whose elements were variously adhered to by different groups of Jews, the tendency has been to emphasize these groups' distinctiveness rather than their intersecting interests, and to lose sight altogether of the vast majority of Jews who probably did not identify with any of them.18 Drawing on "complexity theory," which has been in vogue in mathemat ics and the sciences since the 1990s, I am arguing that while there were many biblically derived ideas and practices that nurtured (and in turn were nurtured by) the habitus of the Jews in Graeco-Roman Palestine, the result was, as articulated in Sages and Commoners, "a type of 'complex adaptive system' that maintained enough order or structure to amount to 'common Judaism,' but which was sufficiently 'chaotic' to allow for inno vation and individuality, in short, for the complexity that often resists compartmentalization or easy characterization."19 brought together in his Judaic Law from Jesus to the Mishnah: A Systematic Reply to Professor Ε.E.

For other discussions of the issue, see the notes to Miller, Sages and Commoners, 21-23. 181 Cf. the observation of Jiirgen Zangenberg concerning Second Temple period sectarian ism: "sects are hardly visible in the material culture and seem to be much more a part of the literary world of ancient (and perhaps modern) authors and their interests."

I am grateful to Jiirgen for our many discus sions of the issues surrounding the interpretation of material finds during our seasons together at Sepphoris. For the use of koine with reference to Judaism, see Steven Fine, Art and and Judaism in the Greco-Roman World (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 5, where Fine calls attention to the use of the term by Peter Brown, Society and the Holy in Late Antiquity Late Antiquity (London: Faber and Faber, 1982), 173-93, who refers to a "Mediterranean koine"koine" and a "Christian koine" in Late Antiquity. 191 Miller, Sages and Commoners, 25-26. When I wrote this book, I was unaware of the interesting attempt of Ziony Zevit, The Religions of Ancient Israel, A Synthesis of Parallactic Approaches Approaches (London: Continuum, 2001), 646-48 to apply complexity theory to Israelite religion. See too, his "False Dichotomies in Descriptions of Israelite Religion: A Problem, Its Origin, and a Proposed Solution," in Symbiosis, Symbolism, and the Power of the Past, (ed. W. G.

Miller / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 214-243 This complex Jewish society had room for zodiacs and depictions of Helios in synagogue mosaics, invocations of Helios such as that found in SeferSefer ha-Razim, and magical amulets.20 In my " 'Epigraphical' Rabbis, Helios, and Psalm 19: Were the Synagogues of Archaeology and the Syna gogues of the Sages One and the Same?"21 and elsewhere I have attempted to move beyond questions as to who "controlled" the excavated, monu mental synagogues, and whose Judaism was reflected in their architecture and artwork. It was precisely because the question of the rabbis' possible influence or lack of influence on these synagogues seemed of little heuris tic value for the study of Judaism in Late Antiquity, that I attempted to demonstrate where rabbinic tradition and some of the themes of the mosaic floors overlap.22 The world of the monumental synagogue and that of the rabbis were not mutually exclusive and certainly not in constant, palpable tension. Their intersection speaks volumes about Jewish society at the time—not because it allows us to isolate and identify a coherent, unified community and the rabbis' role therein—but rather, as Hayim Lapin has pointed out, because it raises questions about how we should characterize such a community or society.23 Lapin sees the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic art found in syna gogues, invocations of Helios, and rabbinic laws that attempted to regu late such developments, as indications of boundaries that were constantly up (229-30) Second Temple period Judaism and, in relationship to biblical religion, speaks (232) of "a minimal Israelite koine of credo and practice similar to the 'common Judaism' of Late Antiquity." Zevit, however, sees a different "organization pattern" underlying Isra elite religion. I think there are closer affinities between Israelite society and that of the Second Temple and later period than Zevit realizes, however. I will return to the relevance of Zevit's observations below. For an attempt to arrive at some of the more "uniform" aspects of the "Judean" habitus in the first century, see Markus Cromhout and Andries van Aarde, "A Socio-Cultural Model of Judean Ethnicity: A Proposal," HTS 62 (2006): 69-101.

Sure, the synagogue mosaic at Sepphoris, with its nonfigurative allusion to Helios, is distinct from the mosaics belonging to the synagogues at Hammat Tiberias and Bet Alfa, which clearly depict the sun god on his chariot. But were the communities that commissioned these mosaics really so different, so much so that we can speak of well-drawn or redrawn boundaries between them? Was there a resistance in fifth-century Sepphoris to the figurative representation of a pagan deity that did not exist elsewhere in the Galilee, either earlier in fourth-century Hammat Tiberias or in sixth-century Bet Alfa? Perhaps, but the material finds more usually do not speak so eloquently in favor of such nuanced understandings.25 What we are left with is a mesh of artistic and spiritual expression that undoubtedly characterized much of Jewish society. Whereas extant texts allow us to identify groups such as the various haireseis ("sects") of the Second Temple period and later the rabbis, archaeological finds seldom allow for this kind of preci sion and instead leave us with a sense that Jewish society in Late Antiq uity more usually defied strict boundary-making, beyond more general typing as "Jews," "Samaritans," "Christians," "pagans," etc., each of which require quotes to signify their fluidity in meaning.26 24&gt; Ibid., 18. 251 Cf. Zeev Weiss, The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 2005), 235, who insists that the more restrained depiction in the Sepphoris mosaic should not be regarded as "a result of the local inhabitants' religious, anti-pagan extremism." Weiss argues that the other mythological themes of the mosaic, including the zodiac, argue against this. What is noteworthy and telling, however, is not only the persistent, pagan themes in the mosaics at Sepphoris, Hammat Tiberias, and Bet Alfa, but also the common architectural configuration of the three synagogues, which drew attention to the ark of the Torah that dominated and towered above the floor. The themes of the floors point to the likelihood that the worshippers in these three synagogues had more, rather than less, in common theologically, which would include notions of the role God and the sun/Helios played respectively in the cosmos. See my discussion in " 'Epigraphical' Rabbis, Helios, and Psalm 19," 58, 71, and, especially, 74-75· 26) The Dead Sea Sect too would have been difficult to discuss had it not been for the texts that the sect left behind. The material remains at the Qumran settlement would hardly have given us the same picture of an organized, well-defined sect.

Some of these threats may only have existed from their perspective, as they continuously defined themselves over and against other Jews. In their case, at least, the drawing and redrawing of their identity was essential for the emergence of a coherent "rabbinic" movement.27 The rabbis' characterization of their Jewish neigh bors indicates that they were drawing boundaries, even if, or when, their neighbors were not, at least not in response to them. And yet the rabbis' boundary-drawing itself is sufficiently elastic, or to borrow Lapin's terms, "porous" and "flexible,"28 inasmuch as the sages were especially preoccu pied with those who shared certain perspectives or practices with them. The terms they use, not just obvious ones, such as minim and 'ammei ha- ares,ha- ares, but also benei-29 and anshei- ha-ir, or, more specifically, beneil 'anshei'anshei town X, whom I have shown were distinct from the 'ammei ha-ares,ha-ares, are rather general designations that reflect an awareness of a larger Jewish society to which the rabbis too, despite their occasional dis tancing, belonged.3״ Their boundary-drawing was not only "porous and flexible," it was also quite transparent! Still, it is important to keep the rabbis' lack of precision in referring to other Jews in mind when we consider archaeological finds such as stepped 27) To be sure, the larger groupings underwent defining and re-defining as Jones argues. See above. I agree that their boundary making was in progress, but it would take time for Christians, Samaritans, and Jews to sort it all out, much as others have argued. My major disagreement with those who postulate a late emergence (or reemergence) of "Judaism" after the christianization of the empire, is that I believe Jewish self-definition was not only well underway earlier on, but also that it had already yielded a pretty well defined, if numerically limited, rabbinic movement by the second c.

Many of the pools at Sepphoris belong to domestic settings among which were found stone vessels as well as earth enware from the known Jewish pottery center at Kefar Hananiah. These settings are notably devoid of pig bone. This composite evidence points to a "Jewish" ethnic identity.32 Fortunately, plenty more may be inferred. We may not have "direct access" to the precise motivations of Jews such as those who lived in Graeco-Roman Sepphoris, but the behaviors suggested by the finds reveal much about their cultural mentality and disposition. Gruenwald speaks of the "transformation" that rituals brought to entire communities.33 I would like to suggest that the transformative value of rituals be broken down further. The contexts of the material finds at Sepphoris lead us to the building blocks of communities, to wit, to the domestic settings and the families that once resided therein. Purity rituals performed in the home had a direct impact on the day to day life of the family, regulating sexuality and possibly, how, when, and what one ate. At the same time, such rituals undoubtedly meant more to their practitioners, who most assuredly viewed the home as the most immediate setting for, to borrow Gruenwald's expression, the "attitudinal space" in which the transforma tion of community and cosmos began.M Of course, we do not want to violate the concern raised earlier about overassigning meaning to archaeological remains. Still, while it is wrong 311 I am purposely avoiding the rabbinic term miqveh/miqvdot ("ritual bath/baths") for reasons that will become clearer below. 32) Of late, some have preferred the term "Judean," or even "Israelite," as opposed to "Jew" and have questioned further the use of the derivative "Jewish." See, for example, Steve Mason, "Jews, Judaeans, Judaizing, Judaism: Problems of Categorization in Ancient His tory," JSJ 38 (2007): 457-512, and cf. John H. Elliot, "Jesus the Israelite was neither a 'Jew' nor a 'Christian: On Correcting Misleading Nomenclature," Journal for the Study of the the Historical Jesus 5 (2007), 119-54. The concerns that have been raised are not germane to the points being made here since I prefer an ambiguous understanding of "Jewish" identity in antiquity which was closer to reality than an overprecise definition of the rele vant Hebrew and Greek terms allows. For this perspective and a defense of the traditional usage, see Daniel R. Schwartz, "'Judaean' or 'Jew'? How Should We Translate Ioudaios in Josephus?" in Jewish Identity in the Greco-Roman World (ed. J. Frey, D. R. Schwartz, and S. Gripentrog; Leiden: Brill, 2007), 3-27. On the difficulty in attempting to distinguish between ethnic, political, and religious connotations of identity in antiquity, see David Goodblatt, Elements of Ancient Jewish Nationalism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 12-14. 331 Gruenwald, Rituals and Ritual Theory in Ancient Israel, 17, 34, 55-56 and 69-70. 34&gt; Cf. ibid., 27-28.</page><page sequence="11">224 S.

Others disagree with this bifurcation. Tikva Frymer-Kensky points out that "pollution," that is, the "lack of purity," affects individuals, the temple, the collectivity of Israel, and the Land of Israel. Accordingly, "pollution and purgation provided a paradigm by which Israel could understand and 35, In what follows, I assume that the engagement within sectarian and other writings dur ing the late Second Temple period with the contents of the Torah and with much of what eventually became known as the "Tanakh" reflects a pervasive knowledge of at least rudi mentary biblical ideas and practices. The many "rewritings" of Scripture during this period certainly take for granted an intense interest in biblical themes among literate circles. At the same time, the existence and functioning of the temple in Jerusalem certainly was predicated upon a general familiarity with at least basic biblical purity laws and percep tions. This familiarity need not have been dependent upon widespread literacy. Nor did it necessarily hinge on public readings of the Torah which are thought to have led to the emergence of the synagogue. To be sure, the oral mentality that is taken for granted in Neh 8:4-8, where Ezra and his associates read the Torah publicly, "translating it and giving the sense" so that it is understood by the people, provides some insight into the dynamic that led to greater awareness of biblical traditions. What needs to be better understood, however, is what Susan Niditch refers to the "complex interplay between oral and literate mentalities," which will move us away from the traditional overemphasis on literacy, with its elitist associations, and will provide us with a better appreciation of the social context and dynamics that were at play in the dissemination of knowledge of biblical (in the wid est sense) writings. See Susan Niditch, Oral World and Written Word: Ancient Israelite Literature Literature Literature (Louisville: Westminster, 1996), 89-130. 36) True, some New Testament scholars have overly identified impurity with sin, but in describing ancient Judaism, the defiling character of sin is still often missed. According to Jonathan Klawans, Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 7, "one cannot set out to discuss impurity in Ancient Judaism without coming to terms with sin and its defiling force." Although Klawans is critical of the efforts of David Z. Hoffman, Adolf Biichler, Tikva Frymer-Kensky and David R Wright, it will be benefi cial for our purposes to see in particular where Frymer-Kensky and Wright are coming from and how they assess matters before returning to some of Klawans' important views (see below n. 48). Klawans does away with the oft repeated view of Gedaliah Alon that there was a tension between the minimalists who restricted purity laws to the temple and the priesthood and the maximalists who believed they applied to all of Israel. The mini malist position of course would be assigned to the Sadducees, and the maximalist to the Pharisees. Biichler also tended to see a dual understanding of purity, speaking in terms of Levitical and religious defilement, much as D. Z. Hoffman did before him.</page><page sequence="12">S. S.

With the further dashing of hope for the restoration of the temple in 135 C.E., a palpable distancing both temporally and physically from its sancta may have been compensated for by further devotion to ritual purity practices, particularly those that pertained to individual members of a household.42 37) Tikva Frymer-Kensky, "Pollution, Purification, and Purgation in Biblical Israel," in The Word Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of David Noel Freedman in Celebration of His His Sixtieth Birthday (ed. C. L. Meyers and M. O'Connor; Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisen brauns, 1983), 399-414, at 399. 38' Essentially, Frymer-Kensky is introducing the role of defilement or "pollution" into the more usual "misdeed and [subsequent] judgment" equation that has been used to explain the destruction of the First Temple. In her words (ibid., 409), "The idea of pollution was a major theoretical paradigm which enabled Israel to absorb and survive [emphasis mine] the eventual destruction of the state." Frymer-Kensky believes that destruction and result ing exile were notions that originated within a system of "cosmic pollution and purga tion." My argument below will be that notions of purity and impurity would persist after the destruction of the Second Temple precisely because of the same dynamic. 391 Ibid., 406, where Frymer-Kensky develops Jacob Milgrom's miasmic understanding of impurities. 40י Ibid., 403. 411 Ibid., 412, especially points to the work of Moshe Weinfeld, 'Jeremiah and the Spiri tual Metamorphosis of Israel," ZAW 88 (1976): 17-56 in this connection. 42) Bathing rituals for postnatal and postmenstrual women as well as for men and women who had engaged in sexual relations or who experienced a genital discharge would be some examples of areas of purity laws that would and did undergo further development.</page><page sequence="13">226 S. S. Miller /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 214-243 David Wright's understanding of "the spectrum of priestly impurity" moves us in this direction. Wright regards the "tolerated" impurities, that is, those brought on by disease and death or by sexual discharges or involvement in certain cultic rites, as protections against the incursion of the more serious "prohibited impurities," by which he means those that result from the disregard of the tolerated impurities or from moral trans gressions.43 Wright insists that the purities system as a whole has symbolic These might be characterized as individual expressions of piety. See Eyal Regev, "Pure Indi vidualism: The Idea of Non-Priestly Purity in Ancient Judaism," JSJ 31 (2000): 176-202. Cf. Jacob Licht, Megillat ha-Serakhim mi-Megillot Midbar Yehudah, Serekh ha-Yahad, Ser ekhekh ha-'Edah, Serekh ha-Berakhot (Jerusalem: Bialik, 1965), 298-99, who points out that the distinction between the rabbis' approach to purities and that of the Dead Sea Sect is that the latter was committed to communal purity practices that were part of a larger, sepa ratist agenda. As opposed to the "Yahad," the rabbis emphasized the fastidiousness of the individual haver within a larger, familial and societal structure to which he continued to belong. Frymer-Kensky, "Pollution, Purification, and Purgation in Biblical Israel," 409, calls attention to the feminine perception of the land and also notes that the menstruant {niddah),{niddah), who is "the ultimate defiled woman," is the symbol for the destroyed nation in Ezek 36:17 and Ezra 9:11 (and possibly Lam 1: 8). Her observation, 413 n. 9, that the Torah does not specify fixed bathing rituals for women after menstruation (or after child birth; it is prescribed for after intercourse), and that the passing of time alone most likely rendered both women and the feminine conceived of land pure, does not in any way undermine my argument. Hannah K. Harrington, The Impurity Systems of Qumran and the the Rabbis: Biblical Foundations (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1993), 123-38, argues that ablu tions following menstruation can at least be inferred from the biblical text. In any event, it is likely that ritual bathing, particularly when cultic rites of purification could no longer be performed in the wake of a national catastrophe, would have taken on new applications and meaning. It is important to keep in mind too that although temple and home were to some extent distinct cultic/religious domains in antiquity, there always was, and undoubt edly continued to be even after the destruction, an interplay between practices and rites carried out in the home/family and those (once) performed at the temple in Jerusalem. See the recent discussion of Stanley K. Stowers, "Theorizing the Religion of Ancient Households and Families," in Household and Family Religion in Antiquity (ed. J. Bodel and S. Olyan; Oxford: Blackwell, 2008), 5-19, esp. 12-14. 43' The tolerated impurities are largely presented in Lev 11-15 and Num 19. See David P.

Olyan; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1991), 152-58. It is important to note that Wright's formulation is truly a "spectrum" with overlapping categories. This allows him to invoke Mary Douglas' structural approach as we shall presently see.

The regulating of impurities that are not threatening, that is, those that are beneficial or unavoidable and are, therefore, tolerated, contribute to the maintenance of "the moral order of society." The rites associated with these tolerated impurities have a prophylactic function, inasmuch as they "prevent the socially detrimental breach of rules that would cause prohibited impurity."44 Wright further points out that the participation of the individual in ritual purity rites fosters a sense of connectedness with a community. Contracting a "tolerated" impurity may not be problematic, but inten tionally delaying purification or in other ways violating relevant restric tions would brand one as a "social rebel and traitor" who has upset the moral order.45 Wright suggests that the consequences of lesser-tolerated ritual impurities, such as lochial and abnormal genital discharges, and leprosy might be latent during periods of "social wholeness" but would increase in significance in periods of "moral decay". He further suggests that during such periods of "dysfunction" the tolerated impurities would serve to "hold the centrifugal forces in." At the same time, the emerging stress might lead to a "revision [emphasis mine] of ritual" in order to keep the moral strains in check.46 Perhaps purity practices provided (as did "rit ual" in general) a sense of security, not just as Wright suggests, in the period of "disintegration" that followed the destruction of the First Tem pie, but also after 70 C.E., when the holiness of 'Erez Israel was further Wright makes between "tolerated" and "prohibited" forms of impurity and his emphasis on their interrelationship remains instructive. 441 Wright, "The Spectrum of Priestly Impurity," 171-72. Some lesser-tolerated but unavoidable impurities, such as lochial and abnormal genital discharges, and leprosy, pol lute the outer altar and require a hatta't sacrifice, just as some inadvertent, prohibited impurities do. However, those who intentionally incur prohibited impurities defile the inner sanctum of the Temple, which requires the purification sacrifices of Yom Kippur, and may be subject to either divine excision (karet) or, in the case of sacrifice to Molec (Lev 20:2-5), execution. See ibid., 155-165. The tolerated impurities are, therefore, a form of "inoculation" against the evils and consequences associated with the prohibited impuri ties. In addition to Wright's "Spectrum," 175, see his The Disposal of Impurity. Elimination Rites Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and Mesopotamian Literature (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1987), 163-228. Also see the following note. 45) Simply put, "lesser impurities do not exist for themselves but are associated with the larger moral concerns of society that lie behind prohibited impurity."

Miller / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 214-243 compromised by the very real presence of pagan institutions and the ubiquitous symbols of Roman domination.47 Indeed, the missing component in appreciating the purities-sin nexus is holiness. Martha Himmelfarb and Hannah Harrington have recently emphasized that the Holiness Code in Lev 17-26 derives its perception and description of grave sins from the Priestly Code.48 Harrington notes 47י Contra Gruenwald, Rituals and Ritual Theory in Ancient Israel, 121, who over-empha sizes the connection of ritual purity practices to the Temple. See Martin S. Jaffee, Early Judaism:Judaism: Religious Worlds of the First Jewish Millennium (2d ed.; Bethesda: University Press of Maryland, 2006), 117, who asserts with regard to the efforts of the rabbis: "Laws that once protected the holiness and purity of the temple and its personnel were now [after 70 C.E.] applied to the territory and the people that the temple had sanctified." Cf. the observations of Hannah K. Harrington, Holiness: Rabbinic Judaism and the Graeco-Roman World World (London: Routledge, 2001), 179. 48) Klawans, 36-38, questions Wrights argument that there is an underlying "moral basis and rationale" to the entire system of purities. Despite obvious overlapping terminology used to refer to both categories of pollution (e.g., tame'), there are distinct terms such as hanefhanef ("to be polluted") and toevah ("abomination") that are only used with reference to moral (prohibited) impurity. Certain moral sins defile the land, whereas no ritual impuri ties do so. As for the sanctuary/temple, here too, sin defiles from a distance whereas ritual impurities only do so through physical contact. Ablution only removes ritual impurities, not moral ones. Finally, those who commit the latter are not restricted from the sanctu ary/temple, whereas those suffering ritual impurities are. Klawans argues that the Bible is not reticent when it comes to the symbolic meaning of rituals (e.g., the Sabbath in Deut 5:14-15 and tassels in Num 15:37-41). However, with regard to ritual purity laws the con nection with the defiling character of sin is nowhere to be found. Thus there is no com pelling evidence in the texts for "two distinct but analogous conceptions of contagion." Some of Klawans objections are reasonable, but not entirely convincing, if only because he too rigidly distinguishes between the Priestly and Holiness Codes, which allows him to argue that the whole biblical purities edifice consists of discreet parts. Himmelfarb, in an unpublished response to Klawans in a session devoted to "Purity from the Bible to the Mishna" at the annual conference of the Association for Jewish Studies, December, 2003 (used with Himmelfarb's permission), sees "one system of laws based on an idea of ritual impurity and another system that refers back to the first and uses elements drawn from it to develop laws for grave sins, of which the vast majority are linked to ritual purity [emphasis mine]." What matters to Himmelfarb is not the Torah's use of distinct terms in its treat ment of ritual and moral impurities, or more generally in the Priestly (P) and Holiness (H) codes, but rather its common usages: "Klawans' separate-but-equal treatment [i.e., of ritual and moral impurities] obscures the debt of the Holiness Code's conception of impu rity to that of the priestly source: The Holiness Code's concept of impurity applies P's technical terminology for ritual impurity, particularly the root tm, but also the term nid dah,dah, to other areas of life."

Miller / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 214-243 229 that the commandment "to be holy" is most pronounced in priestly texts. Yet, the Holiness Code itself is devoted to the beneficial features of God's holiness, which Israel is to emulate. As Jacob Milgrom explains, "It [the Holiness Code] generates blessing and life; it is the antonym and ultimate conqueror of impurity, the symbol of death."49 The rabbis adopted this perception of the dynamics of holiness and impurity, which must have been obvious to many Jews in their day, at least those with some knowl edge of the biblical purity system.50 Christine Hayes captures the precise point I am making:51 Himmelfarb rightly takes Klawans to task for overly-differentiating between the ritual and moral impurities and for arguing that, while we see a conflation of the two categories in the writings of the Dead Sea scrolls, tannaitic literature continues what he believes to be the biblical predilection for compartmentalizing the purity concerns of Ρ and H. Him melfarb instead counters that sectarian writings do not conflate the two categories. Instead, "their use of P's terminology of ritual impurity to describe moral states represents a further development of a process that begins in the Holiness Code." Similarly, Himmelfarb points out that the reason the defiling character of sin appears in aggadah rather than in halakic texts is because "it has very few practical implications," that is, with a single exception, "there is no process of purification from this impurity, nor is there any way to prevent it from being conveyed to the sanctuary or the land." The exception Himmelfarb points to is the shedding of a murderers blood. To be sure, in Klawans' response to Himmelfarb (at the same meeting of the Associa tion for Jewish Studies, cited here with Klawans' permission), he concedes that "the culti vation of purity is about seeking holiness, in emulation of the priesthood," but the point he seems to miss is that holiness is also essential to understanding the relationship between Ρ and H, or more specifically, between ritual and moral impurities. It is precisely his admission that if there is a single system, it is "Israelite religion as a whole," that brings us almost full circle, that is, to a consideration of a more integrated and comprehensive understanding, if not a fully articulated system. 491 Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22, A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (AB; New York: Doubleday, 2000), 1720.

Miller I Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 214-243 some Jews saw the requirements of purity as necessary only when one entered sacred precincts... some may have viewed purity as necessary also when entering sacred time (such as a festival or Sabbath day); others may have viewed purity as necessary when engaged in various sacred activities.. .And it seems entirely reasonable to suppose that some Jews would have under stood the very holiness of the nation Israel as requiring constant vigilance against defilement and attention to purity in all areas of daily life (eating, sexual intercourse, etc.) regardless of the existence of the Temple [emphasis mine]. Nevertheless, even for these maximalists, purity was never an end in itself. Purity was always observed because of its essential connection to holiness [emphasis mine]. Of course, we must ask how much of the dynamics of ritual purity as pre sented in the biblical tradition informs our understanding of stepped pools and stone vessels.52 What is certain, both from rabbinic and mate rial sources, is that Jews continued to be preoccupied with ritual purity long after 70 C.E.53 Shaye Cohens and Martin Goodmans assessments of 52י As Tracy Lemos has recently pointed out, it is important to keep in mind that the TanakhTanakh preserves several purity systems and that rituals had shifting meanings that often depended on locale. Moreover, there likely were other learned notions of defilement that were not neatly regulated by biblical legislation that also played a role in the disposition of the practitioners. Lemos points especially to notions of hygiene that are cross-cultural. See my ensuing discussion, especially of the multiple uses of stepped pools. Cf. Tracy M. Lemos, "Where There is Dirt, is There System?: Revisiting Biblical Purity Construction," forthcoming. My thanks to Tracy Lemos for providing me with an advance copy. 53) It must be emphasized that perceptions drawn from the uncritical use of rabbinic sources often lead to simplistic understandings that read too much of rabbinic thinking into such finds. Steven Fine and I have argued that the use of stone vessels is likely to have been a spin-off from the stone industry that experienced its heyday in Herodian Jerusa lem. This would explain why stone vessel use appears to fall off (but see below, n. 62, end) after the early second century. See my, "Some Observations on Stone Vessel Finds and Ritual Purity in Light of Talmudic Sources," in Zeichen aus Text und Stein■. Studien aufdem WegWeg zu einer Archdologie des Neuen Testaments (ed. S. Alkier and J. Zangenberg; Texte und Arbeiten zum neutestamentlichen Zeitalter 42; Tubingen: Francke Verlag, 2003), 402-19. Cf. Steven Fine, "A Note on Ossuary Burial and the Resurrection of the Dead in First Century Century Jerusalem," JJS 51 (2000): 69-76. Stepped pools, particularly of the stand-alone variety, are likely to have been a local creation that had both ritual and profane uses, espe dally when they belong to domestic settings. Neither stepped pools nor stone vessels should be considered markers signifying a Jewish presence if there is no contextual evi dence to support such identification. While it is generally accepted that we can expect to find stepped pools and stone vessels at sites where Jews are known to have lived, e.g., Sec ond Temple period Jerusalem and Jericho, or pre- and post-70 Sepphoris and other places</page><page sequence="18">S.

Goodman notes that the tannaim were mainly con cerned with corpse impurity, utensils, and especially menstrual contami nation, which was the most frequent source of defilement. At the same time, both Cohen and Goodman insist that the concerns emphasized by the tannaim were those that, in Cohen's words, "were practiced the least by a substantial segment of the population."54 To be sure, Goodman emphasizes that it is the minutiae of rabbinic purity laws that were ignored by the poor man gleaning, the olive treader, and others. This, however, is a potentially misleading conclusion that stems from the preoccupation at the end of the last century with the extent of influence of the Pharisees and the rabbi on Jewish society. Neglect of rabbinic purity laws does not inform us about the actual extent of ritual purity practices, or about the relative meticulousness of those who derived their practices more directly from the biblical tradition. It only indicates that the rabbis found local practice of their halakot to be wanting.55 This was certainly true of the ammei ha-ares, who, nevertheless, were not regarded by the rabbis as entirely lacking in mitzvot. More in Galilee, this does not allow for the wholesale and uncritical referencing of rabbinic sources to fill in the blanks for the details of their use. While it is easy to arrive at the con elusion, certainly with regard to Sepphoris, that we are dealing with Jewish identity mark ers, this is not necessarily the case elsewhere. A lone stepped pool at Mareshah, or Tyre, or a single stone vessel from Dura (such as one I came across in the Yale collection several years ago) does not necessarily testify to a Jewish presence. Conversely, the presence of stepped pools in non-Jewish towns such as Mareshah or Tyre, does not prove that such installations elsewhere were not used for Jewish ritual bathing. Rather, the more germane question at Sepphoris is, what do these markers tell us about those who lived in Sepphoris? Cf. Stuart S.

Ber. 3:4, 6c, where several anecdotes are preserved that reflect the extremes to which commoners went to immerse. Thus we hear that the mid-second century Sepphorean, R. Yose ben Halafta, once warned a donkey driver not to endanger his life by immersing at night. The driver was insistent because he had adulterous relations earlier with a menstruant, so insistent that he didn't listen to Yose and drowned!57 Similarly, a fourth-generation amora, R. Yose ben Yose, when sailing on a ship, reportedly warned a fellow traveler against immersing in the sea before eating.58 We also hear that a "guardian of a vineyard" and a married woman who were planning a sexual tryst were deterred when they had difficulty locating a pool of water to enable them to immerse afterwards to remove the seminal impurity.59 These three stories might be dismissed as unusual anecdotes involving eccentric individuals. However, the same sugya also preserves several epi sodes in which the practices of groups of persons are commented upon. We hear that the "wives of Galilee" were becoming barren from the cold, leading R. Joshua ben Levi to consider doing away with ritual bathing after sexual relations. Another prominent, third-century sage, R. Hanina bar Hama, objected to those who gathered in the morning at the gates of the baths, facetiously calling them tovelei shaharit ("morning bathers"), thereby alluding to a practice which, from Haninas point of view, belonged to temple times.60 Haninas sarcasm notwithstanding, this episode complex and therefore unlikely to be followed. I have responded to this elsewhere. See Miller, "Stepped Pools and the Non-Existent Monolithic 'Miqveh'," 231 n. 59. 56) See t. B. Mesi'a 11:17, 23 (benei ha-ir and the maintenance of miqva'ot) and m. Miqw. 7:1 ('anshei Medeva' testify that R.

The power and meaning of biblical impurities did not simply dissipate after 70 C.E. Moreover, the fact that the rabbis disagreed as to whether a a ba'al qeri (one who experienced a nocturnal pollution) had to immerse in a miqveh, in drawn water, or simply have nine qabbin of water poured over him, is an indication of the variety of practices that must have existed.61 Clearly, the rabbis viewed commoners as invested in ritual purity prac tices well into the amoraic period. This shared interest in purities evi dently cut a wide swath across everyday Jewish life and is reflected in the archaeological record. It is no accident that the majority of the stepped pools and stone vessels from the acropolis at Sepphoris were found in domestic settings. Before these discoveries, archaeologists and historians all too often associated ritual purity practices with the temple and with the priestly class. It was even presumed that interest in ritual purity in 'Erez'Erez Israel subsided following the destruction of the temple in 70 C.E., when stone vessels and ritual baths seem to have faded from Jewish life. Even with the discovery of pools, and, more recently, of stone vessels, from beyond the second century, we still hear echoes of the priestly inter pretation of the finds. This is particularly true with regard to Sepphoris, which was supposedly the home of a priestly course and oligarchy that, along with other priestly interests in Galilee, led to a resurgence of emissions, precisely because it was a widespread practice not only among pietists, but also among the masses. For references and a fuller discussion of y. Ber. 3:4, 6c see my, "Stepped Pools and the Non-Existent Monolithic 'Miqveh'," 223.

Adler posits a shift to a more lenient practice among the amoraim by the fourth century. Full immersion in 'Ens Israel, nevertheless, persisted into the Geonic period, at least according to a seventh-century source. Adler calls attention (71 n. 100) to an interesting letter/responsum attributed to Maimonides that indicates that the practice continued in "Shinar" and Western Europe, but it was regarded as unusual in Christian lands such as Italy, France, and Provence. A ba'al qeri who was seen immersing there would be ridiculed for copying the practices of the Ishmaelites. See Adler, 71, esp. nn. 99 and 100, who cites Teshuvot ha-Rambam, 140. Cf. R.

Stone vessels may have been popular because of their inability, at least according to the rabbis, to contract impurity, but we should keep in mind that Jews may have held conflicting views of the different types of stone vessels and their permissible uses, especially since the Torah is silent about their susceptibility to turn ah.63 After all, a good many stone vessels were found at Qumran, despite the fact that CD 12:15-17 and llQTemple3 62, See my "Priests, Purities, and the Jews of Galilee," in Religion, Ethnicity and Identity in Ancient Ancient Galilee: A Region in Transition, (ed.

The discovery of stepped pools in agricultural and domestic settings as well as in bathhouses and in association with synagogue structures and tombs reinforces the pic ture from rabbinic sources of a society in which the olive treader and the poor man glean ing as well as students of Torah and the wealthy were devoted to ritual purity in their daily lives. Surely, these pools were not for the exclusive use in temple times, of priests, lay pilgrims to Jerusalem, or, after 70, for some haverim who imitated priests or those who wished to maintain a heightened sense of purity in anticipation of a rebuilt Temple.

Hanan Eshel argues that the sect perceived stone as susceptible to impurity only when it came into contact with oil.64 In either case, assuming that the later perspective of the rabbis reflects the practice of earlier, more per missive Jews living in Herodian Jerusalem, there obviously would have been alternate views on the matter in the late Second Temple period. These appear to have persisted into the rabbinic period. T. Makhshirin 2:1 relates an opinion attributed to R. Yose (ben Halafta) according to which certain soft: stone vessels (כלי אבן רכין) were susceptible to turn ah. The fact that a tannaitic source, Sifre Num, 126, expressly considers and rejects the possibility that the stones of a house and stone vessels were included in Num 19:14-15: "...When a person dies in a tent ...all that is in the tent.tent... and every open vessel... shall be unclean for seven days," suggests that there were other opinions on the matter. Corroboration comes from TargumTargum Pseudo-Jonathan to Num 19-14 which reads, "and all that is in the tent, even its floor, its stones, its wood and its vessels shall be unclean for seven days,"65 explicitly indicating that stone could be rendered impure. One wonders whether differing understandings of the verse existed as early as the Dead Sea Sect.66 Conflicting perceptions of relevant biblical traditions certainly existed where ritual bathing is concerned. As I have argued elsewhere, the rabbis use the word miqveh rather loosely in reference to natural and unnatural pools, sometimes even those that belonged to non-Jews. Yet scholars con tinue to speak of the pools as a monolithic institution {"the miqveh") and look to the rabbis to explain precisely how they worked.67 It is biblical tra dition that provides the known instances that require ablutions, some of which are open to interpretation. Of course, the rabbis do provide very y.y.y. Sabb. 8, 11c.

Yad. 4:7 of the difference between the Sadducees and the Phari sees over the ability of an "interposing stream" (nissoq) to render pure water impure was preceded by 4QMMT's reference to musaqot, which may explain why the sect seems not to have resorted to reservoir tanks to purify their ritual baths. Even so, caution is warranted, since the semantic relationship between the Qumranites' musaqot and rabbinic nissoq is not straightforward, as Yaakov Elman has demonstrated.68 Thus, when Asher Grossberg attempts to explain how most of the nineteen pools at Masada functioned as halakically acceptable ritual baths, he may be going too far.69 While some of his reconstructions are quite convincing, the workings of the stand-alone pools, as opposed to those with reservoirs, are more diffi cult to explain. Of the twenty stepped pools uncovered in the northwest em quarter of Sepphoris, only one has what in recent times is called an 'osar'osar ("reservoir") and could easily have functioned in accordance with rabbinic halakah. One other pool has a channel leading from a nearby cis tern to its uppermost stair, and may have functioned along the lines of what the rabbis refer to as hamshakhah, or "conduction," which allowed drawn water to be used to fill the entire pool according to biblical law or at least partially following the understanding of the rabbis. Both of these pools were in existence during the time of the rabbis. Many of the remain ing stand-alone pools at Sepphoris could have been similarly filled or could have used rainwater fed from rooftop pipes, but in most instances it is dif ficult to be certain.70 This does not mean that these stand-alone stepped pools were not rit ual baths. Rather, as I have suggested elsewhere, stepped pools belonging to domestic settings were beyond the rabbis' ability to regulate them and were used for a variety of ritual and even profane purposes, such as rins 68) Yaakov Elman, "Some Remarks on 4QMMT and the Rabbinic Tradition, or When is a Parallel not a Parallel?" in Reading 4QMMT: New Perspectives on Qumran Law and His torytory (ed.

That the construction of some of the Second Temple period pools appears to accord with later rabbinic halakah does not point to the early influence of the Pharisees or rabbis. I doubt that the Herodians and later the Sicarii who occupied Masada were followers of Pharisaic law. Rather, they, like their fellow Jews elsewhere, inherited a common biblical per spective that regarded a corpse, various animal carcasses, leprosy, and sex ual discharges as impure.72 They undoubtedly also were aware of the non-priestly traditions in the Tanakh in which all Israel is commanded "to be holy," traditions in which, interestingly, the forms qiddesh and le hitqaddeshhitqaddesh ("to sanctify," "to sanctify oneself") refer to ritual ablutions in anticipation of theophanies.73 It is unlikely that these biblical associations of bathing in water with experiences of holiness among the people at large were forgotten or relinquished with the destruction of the temple. Still,Still, when we turn forward to rabbinic evidence, it is remarkable, if not surprising, that we so frequently hear of commoners immersing after 71, In general, see Miller, "Stepped Pools and the Non-Existent Monolithic 'Miqveh'," 218, 225, and 228 nn. 18 and 20. m. Miqw. 8:1 reports the view of a Yavnean tanna, R. Eliezer, that miqva'ot near a town or a road should be considered impure since people might have washed their clothes in them, which apparently rendered the water "drawn." Although it is likely that a natural body of water is intended here, there may very well have been a similar temptation to rinse clothes in a more private, domestic ritual bath. Interesting in this regard is b. Besah 18a, which reports the view of an early third-century Babylonian amora, R. Hiyya bar Ashi, that a woman may immerse on a festival in clothes that were impure, thereby purifying both herself and her garments, if she had no others to change into after her immersion. On rabbinic concern for exercising in water, which led the sages to warn against jumping into a miqveh (t. Miqw. 5:14), see Saul Lieberman, "Mei-Aggadah le-Halakhah," reprinted in S. Lieberman/D.

As Jacob Neusner has pointed out, the earliest stages of the rabbinic laws of purities pertain not to cultic, but to domestic matters that most directly affected the "household and its hearth."75 These domestic concerns certainly are evident among the tannaim and amoraim, but their interest undoubtedly developed out of an earlier, more widespread pre occupation with purities. According to Alexei Sivertsev, rabbinic Judaism evolved out of the sages' attempt to superimpose their "holiness project" upon expressions of piety within disciple circles and households that orig inated during the late Second Temple period.76 Others have shown how household traditions influenced the shaping of various mishnayotJ7 Else where, I have documented many instances in which household practices were incorporated by the rabbis of the Yerushalmi into their halakic system.78 It perhaps is in this light that the preoccupation of the sages with the regulation of menstrual laws should be understood. Charlotte Fonrobert has produced nonrabbinic evidence that some Jewish women may have had their own, sometimes stricter, understanding of the biblical menstrual laws.79 No wonder, she posits, the sages characterized Jewish women as 741 The use following menstruation is certainly not surprising to anyone with knowledge of the modern miqveh. Yet other ritual purposes, including the immersion of vessels, have per sisted into modernity and are also expressions of what Andrea Berlin calls, with reference to the first-century C.E., "household Judaism" See my discussion below and cf. Miller, "Stepped Pools and the Non-Existent Monolithic 'Miqveh'," 224 and esp. 231 n. 58. 751 See Jacob Neusner, Judaism, the Evidence of the Mishnah (Chicago: University of Chi cago Press, 1981), 68-69. It is perhaps no wonder that the only tractate of Tohorot that we have, in both Palestinian and Babylonian gemarot, is Niddah. 761 Alexei Sivertsev, Households, Sects, and the Origins of Rabbinic Judaism (Leiden: Brill, 2005), 215 and 272-74. 77' Sivertsev, Households, Sects, and the Origins of Rabbinic Judaism, 212-13, suggests that some sections of the Mishnah may represent revised versions of earlier "household codes" that were preoccupied with the "ideal family life" and, by extension, that of the commu nity. For a discussion of the dynamics of the household as portrayed in the Mishnah, see Hayim Lapin, "The Construction of Households in the Mishnah," in The Mishnah in Contemporary Perspective Contemporary Perspective (2 vols.; ed.

In doing so, the sages were asserting male, rabbinic authority— and, more importantly, identity. For the rabbis of the Mishnah (see m. Nid.Nid. 4:1-2), "daughters of Sadducees" who, with regard to menstrual purity, continued to follow the ways of "their fathers" were regarded as Samaritan women, i.e., as not part of "Israel." Fonrobert notes that even "liminal" Jewish groups had in common the biblical text so it is not sur prising that "Jewish women could have their own interpretations and observations of the biblical laws." This, she reminds us, did not prevent the rabbis, that is, the real "fathers" in Israel, from construing the "cul tural origins" of true "Jewish" women as emanating from themselves.8° The rabbis may have viewed the "daughters of Israel" through a special lens, but this should not distract us from their broader agenda as it per tained to Jewish households.81 The everyday household concerns and tra ditions of the entire family were central to the rabbinic agenda. Moreover, in the Eucharist during the "seven days of their menstrual period." She notes the contrast with t. Ber. 2:13, which states that menstruants may read the Torah and study mishnaic traditions. 80) See Fonrobert, "When Women Walk in the Way of their Fathers," 403-15. Cf. Sivert sev, Households Sects, and the Origins of Rabbinic Judaism, 239-40, who sees the earliest "cases" pertaining to women inspecting each other or having their mothers inspect them for menstrual flow (see t. Nid. 6:8), as household traditions. Sivertsev regards the practices attributed to housewives as "traditions of their fathers" that they learned from belonging to a rabbinic household. He cites Cf. C. Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity: Rabbinic and Chris tiantian Reconstructions of Biblical Gender (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000), 144-47, who discusses the gradual imposition of menstrual restrictions by the rabbis, who take over as the male experts in these matters. See my ensuing discussion. According to Tal Ilan, Mine and Yours are Hers: Retrieving Women's History from Rabbinic Literature (Leiden: Brill, 1997), 51-84, women less frequently appear in Talmudic traditions as time goes on. That there were different perspectives among the sages on the effects of menstruation is evident from the debates of the houses of Hillei and Shammai. Interestingly, despite the tendency of the House of Shammai to be considerably stricter in matters of ritual purity and sexual control both with respect to men and women, when it came to self-inspections for menstrual flow, the House of Shammai granted greater autonomy to women than did the house of Hillei. See Ilan's discussion of m. Nid. 1:1 in her Integrating Women into Sec ondond Temple History (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2001), 66-67. Ilan claims that this fol lows the house of Shammai's general tendency to grant more autonomy to women in such matters as property rights, on which, see ibid., 43-63. sl) See Lapin, "The Construction of Households in the Mishnah," 75, where he asserts that the Mishnah is disproportionately concerned with the movement of females, as opposed to males, in and out of households and in and out of their association with the head of the household.

Miller /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 214-243 by Late Antiquity, the master-disciple relationship would compete with the father-son relationship in rabbinic thinking.82 The larger goal of the sages was very likely a holistic appropriation of both., the female and male members of the household into the holy life that they envisioned for all of Israel.83 This was only natural since the household played a pivotal role, not only as Sivertsev argues, in the late Second Temple period, but already in the biblical tradition, that I am claiming is so essential to understand ing the complex Jewish society under discussion.84 Baruch Levine has emphasized the role of "kinship, clan, and land ownership... in affirming regulate the household may reflect the rabbis' participation in a struggle over local author ity in Roman Galilee that was a result of the provincialization of the rabbinic movement. 821 Sivertsev, Households, Sects, and the Origins of Rabbinic Judaism, 239, points out that, like women, men would have originally received a good amount of their halakic knowl edge via household traditions rather than through abstract teaching. It was only once legal discussions moved from "family lore" to the academy that the rabbis became more territo rial about household traditions. Sivertsev cites Daniel Boyarin's discussion of Beruriah, Carnal Carnal Israel: Reading Sex in Talmudic Literature (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 167-96, as support, but Boyarin sees this especially as a development among the Babylonian academies. Nevertheless, the increased importance of the (male) teacher as opposed to the father in passing on societal values in Late Antiquity seems well-docu mented. See Peter Brown, Society and the Holy in Late Antiquity (London: Faber and Faber, 1982), 149-50, and cf. Catherine Hezser, The Social Structure of the Rabbinic Movement in Roman Roman Palestine (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1997), 341-42. Hezser builds on Browns observations in her discussion of the relationship between rabbis/masters and disciples in light of that between fathers and sons. Perhaps the tensions between bishops and local patresfamiliaspatresfamilias in Late Antiquity reflect a similar tension over authority within Christianity. See Cooper, "Approaching the Holy Household." On the portrayal of rabbis/disciples and parents/children in Talmudic literature in general, see Shlomo Riskin, "Ha-Yahas bein Horim le-Vanim u-vein Rabbanim le-Talmidim: Samkhut ve-Herut be-Masoret Yisra'el," in Be-Darkhei Shalom: 'Iyyunim be-Hagut Yehudit Muggashim le-Shalom Rozenberg (ed. B. Ish Shalom and A. Berholts; Jerusalem: Bet Morashah bi-Yerushalayim, 2007), 607-20. 85' As Sivertsev, Households, Sects, and the Origins of Rabbinic Judaism, 255, sees it, rab binic Judaism would eventually "limit and affirm" the role of households. The rabbis would make households "objects of scholastic holiness discourse" but would no longer treat them as "full-fledged participants" in their legal proceedings. Although Sivertsev, 272-74, asserts that disciple circles with time would supplant the role of the family in the transmission of traditions in the "great holiness project" of the rabbis, he readily admits that the everyday life of the family continued to be regarded as essential to their project. For instances of tannaitic case-law that seem to incorporate many households into a larger community, suggesting that the rabbis had the greater community of Israel in mind, see Sivertsev, 269-71. M) Here Fonrobert's assertion that some Jewish women may have had their own under standings of the biblical menstrual traditions is particularly pertinent. See above.</page><page sequence="28">S. S.

The "Israelite koine" he claims, was therefore different from the "common Judaism" of the Second Temple period, which was characterized by sects that were organized according to their ideologies, geographical diffusion, political aims, and authority.86 Zevit, incidentally, invokes "complexity theory" to understand Iron Age Israel, but he obvi ously did not realize that its application to the Second Temple period might have led him to characterize that epoch differently.87 The tribal connec tions of the biblical period may have subsided, but kinship and propin quity continued to play an important organizational role in Jewish society right on through the Graeco-Roman period, as indicated by Second Tem pie period and Talmudic literature. The material evidence points in the same direction, so much so that Andrea Berlin characterizes first-century Judaism as "household]\1dzism."ss Whatever meaning was originally attrib uted to stepped pool and stone vessel usage at Sepphoris and other known centers of Jewish life, they are remarkable testimony to the role domestic life played in a complex Jewish society out of which the rabbis emerged. In conclusion, I would like to suggest that the vacuum left by the destruction of the temple was addressed, not (at least not exclusively) as Shaye Cohen would have it, by the forming of a harmonious "Grand Coalition" of sects and groups,89 but rather by the lingering and pervasive biblical notions of purity and holiness that continued to have meaning in the daily lives of many, if not most, Jews within their homes and communities in their Holy Land. The interplay of purity and holiness as 851 Baruch A.

The holiness of the land and of the people of Israel continued to have meaning after 70 C.E.90 Once the holy temple had been destroyed, the inextricable connection between these residual notions of holiness and the biblically derived purity laws was more acutely perceived, leading to an increase rather than a lessening of ritual purity practices in everyday life. Purity did not "break out" suddenly in Second Temple times, as is sometimes claimed; nor were its ramifications less palpable after 70 C.E.91 The late second-century tanna, R. Simeon ben Eleazar, had it right when he pointed out "the extent to which purity had spread192 (עד היכן פרצה טהרה). R. Simeon is specifically referring to household-centered precau tions taken to ensure that those suffering from abnormal genital or men strual discharges not render profane foodstuffs impure, precautions that apparently went beyond strict tannaitic halakah.93 The emulation of an ideal, pure and holy life was an essential element of "complex common Judaism," one that survived the catastrophe of 70 C.E. and nurtured nascent rabbinic Judaism. One final thought to bring things full circle: we began our discussion with Satlows assertion that the unity as opposed to the diversity of Juda ism is elusive.94 In a recently published book devoted to revisiting Sanders' 90י This is certainly evident in the writings of the rabbis. As Martin Jaffee puts it, "It is as if, with the destruction of the physical temple, the land and the people of Israel had themselves absorbed the invisible essence that constituted its holiness." See Jaffee, Early Judaism,Judaism, 117, where he further discusses "the People and the Land of Israel in the Cosmic Order" of the rabbis. Cf. Harrington, Holiness: Rabbinic Judaism and the Graeco-Roman World,World, 101, who notes that produce of the land continued to be regarded as holy after 70 C.E. and tithes were still separated, despite the fact that priests and Levites no longer functioned in an official capacity. 9" Further complicating matters is the common assumption that it was exclusively the priests who were responsible for fostering biblically derived "levitical" practices. Cf. the comments of Klawans, Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism 23, on the misleading use of "Leviticus, "levitical" etc. See too Miller, "Stepped Pools and the Non-Existent Monolithic 'Miqveh'," 222-24 and my discussion above of the reading of priestly interests into the material finds. 921 As opposed to "broke out."

The discrete Judaisms that Neusner sees both in the Second Temple period and behind each rabbinic document were not disconnected enti ties. At the same time, there was no prevailing, easily defined and unified "Judaism," that "served to sustain all Judaisms."100 Commonness should not be confused with unity.
