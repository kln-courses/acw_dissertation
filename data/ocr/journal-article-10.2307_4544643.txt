<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 21, Bedford Square, London, W.C.1, on 30th January, 1961, at 7.30 p.m. VII-SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM By PAUL SELIGMAN By general consent Spinoza is the most rigorous and uncom- piomising of the Rationalists. His principal work, the Ethics, is presented in the form of a geometrical system; his method is deductive and a priori, and, with few exceptions, he invokes experience only by way of illustration and in order to assist his reader. His metaphysics, with its exclusion of final causes and extra-mundane agencies, is strictly determinist and thus supplies an appropriate philosophical background to the underlying beliefs of seventeenth century science. Yet, right to our day interpreters have discovered in Spinozism not only the discipline of reason and logic, but also a mystical, pantheistic strain. This, in accordance with their own predilection, some have extolled as a deeply religious affirmation, while others have tried to explain it away or have left it on one side as not pertinent to a critical examination of Spinoza's arguments. Spinoza may be approached from many different points of view. I have found a key to his philosophy in his conceptions of God and of knowledge of God, and what I have to say will largely centre around these ideas. By way of introduction I shall broach the issue of mysticism, since it is relevant to the subjects which have engaged my attention. I shall maintain that an element which we should normally describe as mystical is present in Spinoza. I agree that this element does not osten- sibly interfere with the chain of his arguments, which can therefore be examined without paying more than passing attention to it. But in that case an important aspect of his philosophy would be missed out. " Reasoning ", Spinoza reminds us, " is like a staircase by which we can climb up to the desired place ", climb up, that is to say, " without any falsity or deception ".'1 It 1 Korte Verhantdeling (KV)-Short Treatise on God, Man and his Well- Bein-Bk.

This treatise, written soon after Spinoza's excommuni- cation, sketches out the main positions of the later Ethics. 0</page><page sequence="2">110 PAUL SELIGMAN proves and justifies but is not what we should call an end in itself. 11 The avowed over-all goal of Spinoza's philosophical activity is human blessedness; his doctrine is meant to serve life,2 to show how man can realize his nature to the full, how he-may reach the greatest perfection,3 and so the greatest joy of which he is capable. And while this perfection is attained through self- knowledge and what I will provisionally call knowledge of the universe, it is not apparent from Spinoza's writings that he intended his metaphysical system as a blueprint or an explanatory model of the universe. Knowledge has pre-eminently practical significance; it is certainly not meant to satisfy scientific curiosity, or even that sense of wonder of which Aristotle speaks as the source of philosophy, but characterizes the ideal state of the mind. This may become more obvious to us when we remember that it culminates in the mind's cognition of its union with the whole of nature, " cognitio unionis quam mens cum tota natura habet."4 ' Tota Natura' Spinoza identifies with God or infinite substance, and cognition of our union with nature is therefore cognition of our union with God. I shall return to the Spinozistic conceptions of God, nature and substance. Here I wish to stress that in his scheme the relation of the individual to God is much closer, much more intimate than envisaged by any philosophical doctrine, or religious dogma, of which I know. And that not only in the perfected state in which man has become aware of his union with God: already from Spinoza's initial distinction of substance and mode, and from his denial of sub- stantial being to man it follows that the essence of man is but an affection, a finite mode of God, which expresses His nature 2 Cp. Ethica (E), pt. 1I, praef. and propos. 49 schol. 3 = the greatest measure of reality; see E 1I, def. 6. 4 Tractatus de Intellectus Einendationze (TIE) Gebhardt ed., vol. 11, p. 8.</page><page sequence="3">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 1 1 "in a certain and determinate manner... it is in God, and without God can neither be nor be conceived."5 Essentially we share in God's infinite nature and hence are utterly dependent upon Him, and we become truly ourselves as our understanding reaches the point at which we know this, i.e., know that " we are really partakers of an immutable and eternal object ",6 and to that extent cease to be at the mercy of transient external causes. Hence the apparent paradox that self-dependence or human freedom is tantamount to the realization of absolute dependence on God! Further, the love which springs from that knowledge, " the intellectual love of the mind towards God is part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself" (E V, 36). In this love, which is the consummation of our intellectual endeavour and the acme of human blessedness, the cognitio unionis becomes itself a union: God is thinking in us-we are thinking His thoughts. The notion is reminiscent of the German mediaeval mystics (whose writings, incidentally, were not known to Spinoza): " The eye with which I see God", says Meister Eckhart, " is the same eye with which God sees me." Even if we bear in mind the strictly impersonal character of the Spinozistic deity and discard all scriptural and anthropomorphic associations which the ideas of love and of love of God tend to evoke in us, the mystical character of the doctrine remains: The union of which Spinoza speaks is not an abstraction (in his sense)7, but involves conscious- ness of ourselves as essentially partaking of the infinite Being which is God or Nature. III When speaking of mystical literature we are inclined to assume that the writer has had some special experiences which he 5 E II, 10 corol.; Cp. 1, 25 corol. I E V, 20 schol.; cp. E II, 49 schol.: " . . . we are partakers of the divine nature in proportion as our actions become more and more perfect (= real = self-dependent) and we more and more understand God." I Cp. E 1, 40 schol. I and TIE p. 34. o 2</page><page sequence="4">112 PAUL SELIGMAN attempts to describe and which form the basis of ontological assertions as well as of practical guidance. Thus Professor Broad8 mentions the Spinozistic notion of scientia intuitiva or third kind of knowledge (which is knowledge of God, and knowledge under the aspect of God) as " the philosophic expression of certain religious and mystical experiences which Spinoza and many others have enjoyed and which seem supremely important to those who have had them ", but then excludes it from his argument as not relevant to Spinoza's moral theory in the strict sense. 1 have two observations to make on this: (i) In my view, no evaluation of any part of Spinoza's Ethics can be true to him if it omits the idea of God on which his thought depends and in which it issues. Neither his moral teaching nor his psychology are self-contained departmental studies, but both receive their orientation from the cognitio dei. (ii) On Spinoza's premisses it does not, I have come to think, seem appropriate to speak of mystical experiences as distinct from Ethica demonstrata. Experiences such as some of the great mystics have described are visionary; in Spinoza's scheme they would provide knowledge of the first kind and be of relative, not of ultimate value, i.e., they would not be self-authenticating. If Spinoza has had such experiences, then his understanding had already transformed them when he began to write. The ubiquity of God follows from the definition of God, and' unio mentis cum tota natura' is not bestowed as a rare gift, but clearly and distinctly conceived by an active mind. We should, I believe, guard against two prejudices. The first lies in the tacit assumption that a doctrine of the union of the human mind and God or Nature requires validation by reference to some special subjective experiences which can only be (and have been) described in metaphorical or poetical terms. The second consists of the denial of philosophical relevance to such a doctrine because it still betrays mystical and imaginary affiliations. Certainly, what Spinoza tells us can no longer be experienced or imagined; it can only be understood. But the ' Five TYpes of Ethical Theory (1930) 15 f.</page><page sequence="5">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 113 understanding is not concerned with things intrinsically different from those which are presented to us in sensory and imaginary experience; it is the same things which it perceives differently, namely as " necessary " and " under a certain form of eternity" (E II, 44 &amp; cor. 2). IV Is Spinoza's impersonal Deus sive Natura God or is it nature? This question may appear an improper one, but needs to be asked all the same, because Spinoza's conception has affinities with our own contrasted conceptions of God and of nature so that our interpretations tend to be coloured by either the one or the other. Since the intellectual climate of to-day seems to favour naturalistic interpretations, I begin by considering these. We might for instance say that Spinoza's conception of infinite substance or God or tota natura (which I have rendered as ' the whole of nature ') is equivalent to our own notion of ' nature as a whole ', i.e., with all things that exist, past, present and future, taken collectively, with the proviso, however, that while particular things depend on other particular things, all things taken together, since by definition they exclude nothing, cannot but represent a self-dependent, i.e., self-perpetuating whole. We might then take the further step of discarding ontology altogether, and analyse Spinoza's key conception and his system of attributes and modes as the logical framework which is pre-supposed by the search for natural causes, as pursued by the sciences of his time. This, no doubt, is correct as far as it goes. Spinoza's system, in which " all things are determined from the necessity of the divine nature" (E I, 29), does by implication provide such a framework. On the other hand, anyone who is satisfied with an exclusively naturalistic interpretation will have to ask himself why Spinoza should have felt the need at all of calling his infinite substance God, and why he defined God as substance consisting of infinite attributes. Turning to the latter question first, a logical framework,</page><page sequence="6">114 PAUL SELIGMAN such as suggested, would require no more than the two attributes of thought and extension, the only ones that are known. No contradiction would be involved in conceiving substance as infinite and limiting its attributes to two, provided each of these was conceived as infinite in its own kind, which in fact is Spinoza's doctrine. If, to follow Professor Wolfson,9 infinite substance is but " a logical shell holding the particular things of the universe together ", then there is indeed " no logical justification " for Spinoza's positing of infinite attributes. The explanation usually given is that in ascribing infinite attributes he simply followed the tradition of mediaeval philosophy. But this will not do, for the scholastics wished to express that the qualities of the Creator are inexhaustible, using ' infinite ' in the imaginary sense of an indefinite process of counting. Spinoza's attributes, on the other hand, do not cumulate, but each, in its own kind, expresses infinite and eternal essence. Spinoza, who saw the similarity in the definition, pointed out that the qualities which his pre- decessors had ascribed to God were really propria, but not attributes in his sense (cp. KV I, cc. 2 &amp; 7). Perhaps the other question is more important: Why did Spinoza call his infinite substance God? In the comparatively early Short Treatise (n. I above) Spinoza begins with God, and this, on any interpretation of his key conception, is under- standable enough when we bear in mind his Jewish upbringing: and learning. He first gives proofs of the existence of God, more or less on traditional lines, next tells us ' what God is ' in the scholastic terminology of substance and attribute, then boldly passes to his equation of God with Nature which is his most radical departure from traditional religious thought. God is no longer conceived of as the immaterial Creator ab extra, but immanent in His 'creation'. Accordingly, in the Ethics Spinoza no longer begins with God. The first four definitions and first ten propositions concern substance and attribute alone", and when in proposition 11 God is reintroduced into the argument and proofs of His necessary existence are given, Spinoza has Harry Austryn Wolfson, The Philosophy of Spinoza (1934) II, 341ff.</page><page sequence="7">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 115 already established that it pertains to the nature of substance to exist and that substance is necessarily infinite. Consequently there was no further need to supply proofs of the necessary existence of God, which is the necessary existence of infinite substance. In the Ethics the concept of God has been developed from the concept of substance, and Spinoza could consistently have pursued his subsequent argument by proving his theorems of substantia sive natura in lieu of Deus sive natura. Instead lhe dropped the term substance altogether and in the sequel spoke of God only, a procedure for which I can find no logical grounds. Professor Wolfson concludes that Spinoza introduced God merely as an " appeasive term " (op. cit. I, 177) and that " his reputed God-intoxication was nothing but a hang-over of an earlier religious jag" (II, 348). Spinoza's infinite substance acting by the necessity of its own nature, Wolfson sums up, is but " an eternal machine ", and Spinoza was " under a delusion " when he identified his " logical shell" with the traditional God and tried to accommodate his philosophy to the vocabulary of religion (ibid. 345 if.). V If a naturalistic interpretation of Spinoza's key idea were the only possible one, then it would indeed be difficult to resist Wolfson's verdict. Yet, notwithstanding my admiration for his encyclopaedic work, I believe that he cannot be right here. I submit that we can place trust in Spinoza's sincerity and independence of mind; where he seems to follow or discovers links with the doctrines of the Hebrews10 he does so from the necessity of his own thinking, but not by blind adherence to a convention, let alone in order to placate. His break with the tradition-both in his personal conduct and in his doctrines- went far too deep for any such assumption to be credible. I conclude that when Spinoza speaks of God he speaks significantly, 10 E.g., E II, 7 schol., E V, 36 schol., Epistola (Ep) 73 to Oldenburg.</page><page sequence="8">116 PAUL SELIGMAN and it is on this basis that my elucidation of his key idea will proceed. As a preliminary step I will set out five characteristic features of Spinoza's thought. (1) Spinoza's metaphysics is made articulate by a number of fundamental distinctions, of which I will mention four. The first is that between substantial and modal existence, between that which is in itself and is conceived through itself, and that which is in another thing through which it is also conceived. This, incidentally, is Spinoza's original distinction; the Spinozistic mode has hardly anything in common with the scholastic notion of accidens which in a sense it replaces. His second distinction is between infinite and finite. This partly overlaps with the first distinction, in so far as God or substance is infinite and indeterminate, while finite things are determingte modes; but there are also infinite modes through which substance displays itself, namely infinite intellect under the attribute of thought, and motion and rest under the attribute of extension, and mediated through these the face of the whole universe (facies totius universi). Spinoza's third significant distinction is between active and passive nature, natura naturans and natura naturata. This distinction coincides with that between substance and modes: substance as perceived in its attributes is intrinsically active and self-dependent, while all modes, whether finite or infinite (cp. Ep. 9 &amp; 64) are passive in the sense of being other- dependent; they can neither be nor be conceived through them- selves, e.g., motion and rest presuppose extension, the face of the whole universe presupposes motion and rest and infinite intellect.'" A fourth and final distinction is that between two types of cauisality: the series of causes by which one finite thing is determined to existence and action by another finite thing, and that again by another and so on ad infinitum, and the sense in which God or infinite substance is the efficient cause 1 Finite modes are not relatively active or passive with reference to other finite modes conceived under the same attribute.</page><page sequence="9">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 117 of the existence and essence of all things (cp. E I, 16 &amp; 25 with I, 28). In accordance with this distinction, the progress of man's self-knowledge and understanding, considered in section II of this paper, can be described as a passage from finite causes to the causality of God. (2) It is important to note that, by the use of the term 'modal' of the finite, the latter has already been referred to the infinite; qua mode of infinite substance it ceases to be the merely finite. Accordingly Spinoza proceeds to explain the causality by which finite things act upon, and determine, one another (E I, 28) as modifications in the infinite mind of God (E II, 9). The finite is shown to be essentially and existentially dependent upon the infinite from which it has been distinguished. The exposition and demonstration of the relation between infinite and finite, by which we comprehend the finite in terms of the infinite, is the content of Spinoza's Ethics. But the relation, however closely conceived, presupposes, and derives its importance from, the distinction. To put it in general terms: Every monistic idea-the One, the Absolute, God-in its very conception presupposes something ther from which it is distinguished, and which is then reinter- preted in terms of its relation to, or under the aspect of, the idea. Self-understood as this principle may be, in the case of Spinoza it needs to be made explicit, since owing to his deductive method the relation or synthesis, which is the goal of his thought, has been packed into his initial definitions and is implied by his substance/mode terminology. The great divide between God and things is bridged, as it were, as soon as it has been stated, because Spinoza has already done all the thinking before his argument begins.12 (3) This brings me to the peculiar position in which we find ourselves when trying to understand Spinoza's conception of 12 "6 Great divide "-cp. Ep 54: " . . . between finite and infinite there is no proportion; so that the difference between God and the greatest and most excellent creature is the same as that between God and the least creature."</page><page sequence="10">118 PAUL SELIGMAN God; for we still have to arrive at scientia intuitiva from which his argument arises. But for this purpose we have no choice but to rely on the Ethics itself as our guide. That means to say, we need to increase our self-knowledge, as explained in its latter parts, and go the whole way from knowledge of finite causes to understanding finite causes as modifications in God's infinite nature, and finally to knowledge of the causality of God. Unless we actually come to see the finite and seemingly contingent as necessarily determined by the infinite and eternal, we seem hardly justified in claiming that we have understood Spinoza's conception of God, or what amounts to the same thing: that there exists in us the true idea, which alonie, according to him, can become the source of other true ideas (cp. TIE, pp. 16 f). This links up with the essentially practical character which knowledge and understandinig have in Spinoza's system, and to which attention has already been drawn. And it implies that understanding that system is integral to the system itself, and vice versa. It would therefore appear that the Ethics cannot be adequately judged ab extra, like a blueprint of an explanatory model (to repeat an earlier expression). Rather it is something to be realized and brought to life in the mind of the individual and, when realized, will be seen to be true; something too, however, which the mind may fail to realize. (4) Accordingly, no fixed place has been assigned to man himself within the Spinozistic system and its polarity of finite and infinite. It is the progress of man's intellect which determines his place. By definition man is a finite thing, whose existence and actions are determined by finite causes, who may or may not exist-a member of the ordlo communis naturae. And by definition the object of the idea constituting the human mind is a body qua actually existing-and nothing else (E II, 13). But the human body is finite and corruptible, and the mind has only confused and inadequate knowledge of it (ibid. schol., further II, 24, 27, 28). In so far, however, as the human mind understands the human body and itself as determined by God or tota natura rather than by an indefinite sequence of finite causes, in so far, that means to say, as the lhuman mind conceives the essence of</page><page sequence="11">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 119 individual objects under the form of eternity, it knows God, and in knowing God is active and partakes of His infinite thinking. The human mind thus has the power of transcending the finiteness of the common order of nature, to which it belongs qua constituted by the idea of its body. It is in the exercise of this power that Spinozism is realized.13 (5) Obviously Spinoza's metaphysical system is not at all like a static pattern which we may contemplate at leisure. The Ethics, though demonstrated by a priori reasoning, is not something given, but involves transformation at all points. 1Htence I agree with commentators who hold that Spinoza is trying to make us use words in new senses, or see things differently from how we normally see them,14 although, in my view, they understate the profound changes which are required. And I likewise agree with those who have stressed the dynamic character of Spinoza's philosophy,15 referring to such passages as: " The more perfection (=- reality) a thing possesses, the more it acts . . ." (E V, 40);" ... it is as impossible for us to conceive that God does not act as that He does not exist." (E 11, 3 schol.) Spinoza identifies the attributes of God as His powers16 and the essence of an individual thing as its conatus (E 111, 7). But even more important in this connexion is the prominent place which he assigns to causal necessity. If it be said that a dynamic or activity interpretation of Spinoza's thought is precluded by the geometrical order in which 13 The human mind quia mode of God's thinking is eternal and con- sequently does not perish with the body. But this Spinozistic ' immortality' is an impersonal one, since in the absence of the body the mind is deprived of the affects which constitute personal life. In the Short Treatise (KV 1I, 22) Spinoza distinguishes the mind's union with God (in which it realizes its eternal state) as a regeneration or second birth, from its union with the body which is its first birth. ' E.g., R. G. Bosanquet (1918-44) in Mind NS 215 (1945). 15 So most forcefully A. Wolf The Correspondenice of Spinoza (1928&gt; Introd. ? 8; Cp. L. Roth, Spinoza (1929) 72, 83f., J. Freudenthal (ed.

Yet, in Spinoza the former essentially includes the idea of efficient, productive action which is absent from the latter. It would therefore not be correct to say that Spinoza's finite causes are ' causes ' and that God or substance is the 4 ground ' of the whole order of finite causes; the difference rather needs to be stated in terms of the inadequacy or adequacy of our knowledge of the true cause. Finally, since the order and connexion of ideas is the same as the order and connexion of things (E II, 7), order and connexion must be conceived under one and the same category. Hence Spinoza speaks in places of causa sive ratio. Causes are reasons, but reasons are also causes. Thus God or substance is the cause of things, i.e., of their existence and essence, and He is both reason and cause of the adequate ideas which we form of them. VI I will now return to the conception of Deus sive Natura. In view of the features of Spinoza's thought which we have just considered, it will, I think be accepted that 'God or Nature' is not merely another name for ' all that is ' or' nature as a whole '. Rather ' all that is ' is to be understood by reference to God as 17 E.g., TIE p. 35, Ep. 60; cp. A. Wolf, loc. cit. Spinoza does not of course deny that geometrical figures are eternal objects, while a movement takes place in time and is completed in time. Yet, there is no contradiction involved. As Spinoza points out, his definition of a geometrical figure allows for the deduction of all its properties and therefore is an adequate idea, i.e., an eternal truth in the mind of God. It is the production of this or that particular geometrical figure which is temporal and finite.</page><page sequence="13">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 121 its cause. The effect follows necessarily from the cause, but the cause, though immanent and displayed in the effect, is not identical with it. " With the aggregate totality of all things" writes Professor Wolfson (op. cit. I, 324f.), and I agree with him, " with the totality of modes, facies totius universi, God is not identical. He is identical only with Himself." The fundamental distinctions which lie at the root of Spinoza's philosophy are not lost in his synthesis and in the transformation which it involves. If we were to say, therefore, that God or substance is ' nature as a whole conceived as self-perpetuating', we should have said too much at once and begun at the wrong end, as it were;' for our assertion in fact would come to this: that God is passive nature conceived as active. We thus should have reversed Spinoza's thought, since according to him, God is active nature from which passive nature flows of necessity. Passive nature, though an infinite whole, is made up of parts. God, or substance, and His attributes are indivisible. Even in the extreme case of the mind's union with God, there is no identity of mind and God. There is identity of thoughts in so far as our thoughts are eternal constituents of His intellect, i.e., of an immediate infinite mode of God, but not of God Himself (cp. E 1, 17 schol. &amp; V, 40 schol.) God cannot be described. Each of His attributes is of a kind, and expresses infinite and eternal essence in that kind. But since God consists of infinite attributes, His essence cannot be described in terms of kinds of attributes, i.e., as thought -P extension + x + y + . . . + n.18 God is not a such and such. " Of His essence ", Spinoza says, " we can form no general idea " (Ep. 50). By ascribing infinite attributes to God Spinoza in fact affirms that He is absolutely indeterminate, and this implies that He transcends whatever He displays, and may be known, under any of His attributes. The essence of God is existence,19 i.e., existence per se, 18 Cp. R. L. Saw, The Vindication of Metaphysics (1951) 52: " . . . thinking and extension do not describe infinite substance." 1' Cp. Ep. 10 and Cogitata Metaphysica II, 1: " . . . existentia Dei est Deus ipse." Note that existence is not a predicate!</page><page sequence="14">122 PAUL SELIGMAN self-caused and unmodified. This is expressed in each of His attributes, and we have a clear and distinct idea of it. Existence implies power, and power implies active determination. In and through His modes God or infinite substance determines an infinite number of things to exist, each endowed with the effort to persevere in its own being. This effort or power is the actual essence of the thing itself (E III, 7). It is its finite share, as it were, in God's infinite power. Thus God is the efficient cause not only of its existence but also of its essence (E 1, 25), and so far it expresses God's nature in a certain and determinate manner. (E II, 10 cor.) But what is determinate has duration and is dependent on other determinate things, and so far is passive, and thus partly negates God's infinite essence. " Finiteness ", Spinoza says, " is in truth partly negation and infinitude absolute affirmation of existence... *"20 The point I wish to make here is that these partial negations, even when considered as a whole, can never yield us the idea of absolute affirmation of existence. But it is this absolute affirmation which the mind intuits in the cognition of its union with tota natura. VII "Men are not created but only begotten ." (Ep. 4). What are the grounds for Spinoza's conviction that he had attained to the true idea of God? This conviction presupposes, I think, that his conception of God, though radically different from the ideas of his ancestors and predecessors, was still sufficiently continuous with their thinking to allow for a comparison in terms of adequacy or inadequacy. I mention both ancestors and predecessors because the Spinozistic idea dei should be seen in relation to scripture and traditional Jewish teaching, as well as to the doctrines of the philosophers (e.g., Crescas and Maimonides). As far as the latter are concerned, Spinoza was influenced by them in many 20 E 1, 8 schol. 1; cp. Ep. 36 &amp; 50-" Determinatio negatio est."</page><page sequence="15">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 123 ways. But he was also aware that their attempts to make the Biblical ideas of a personal God and of an act of creation in time conform to reason, by grafting Aristotelian conceptions on prophetic revelation (as he might have put it), led to insoluble contradictions and paradoxes. I shall not go into these since they have been dealt with at length by Spinoza's commentators.21 As against the philosophers, Spinoza's claim certainly stands. But more important in this connexion are the areas where Spinozism and the Jewish religious tradition meet. I shall map out, however briefly, three such areas and indicate similarities and differences between the Hebrew and Spinozistic concep- tions. (1) Both Judaism and Spinoza teach knowledge and love of God as a way of life and blessedness. Both doctrines are essentially practical. In the Jewish tradition, -knowledge of God is enshrined in the recorded revelations to the Patriarchs, to Moses and the Prophets, and in the Law of the Pentateuch which is taken to be the Word of God. Accordingly the Jewish way of life has two aspects: It consists of the learning as well as of the observance of the divine ordinances, of exegesis and interpretation on the one hand, and obedience on the other. Spinoza takes the conceptions of divine knowledge and divinie law seriously. May I say, he takes them further? He does not, indeed, -dispute the revelational experiences which are described in scrip- ture nor underestimate their moral significance, but he does insist that they were private, perceived by the imagination (i.e., concretely represented) and relative to the temperament, opinions and purposes of the persons concerned. Moreover, their authentica- tion depended on signs, 22 i.e., they were not self-authenticating. Further, the records of these experiences rest on a tradition which is by no means secure or free from ambiguities, and therefore open to critical examination, as Spinoza was the first to see. Finally, the laws of scripture are like human laws, in so far as they can 21 E.g., Wolfson, op. cit., passim; Stuart Hampshire, Spinoza (Penguin ed. 1951) 40 f. a2 Tractatuis Theologico-Politicius (TTP) c. J1.</page><page sequence="16">124 PAUL SELIGMAN be obeyed or transgressed, and their obedience is rewarded and their transgression punished. According to Spinoza, knowledge of God, of the most perfect (-the most real) Being must be self-evidently true (since all other knowledge depends on it), and hence be indubitably certain; and the laws of God must be such as by their very nature cannot be transgressed (KV II, 24). Consequently adequate knowledge of God can only be realized by that part of the human mind, common to all men, which apprehends His intrinsic necessity, that means to say, not by the imagination or outward signs, let alone by imposed observances, but by the understanding. The true covenant, Spinoza says, is inscribed in the human mind, stamped with God's own seal, namely the idea of Himself (TTP c. XII). (2) Spinoza was similarly in earnest about two other notions which are basic to Judaism: the Eternity of God and the One-ness of God, where one-ness or singleness assert both His unity and His uniqueness. Jewish monotheism, it may be recalled, arose in opposition to the polytheistic religions of the Near East, and the unity and imperishability of God are proclaimed against the multifarious idol workship of the heathen: He is the One God and man is enjoined to have no other gods before Him. Now Spinoza holds that the Old Testament conception of God is anthropomorphic in the sense that He is thought of as a person, acting from purpose and design. If eternity is attributed to this personal deity all that can be meant is time without beginning or end, i.e., indefinite duration, and of this we can have no adequate, i.e., clear and distinct idea. As far as one-ness is concerned Spinoza remarks that " we do not conceive things under the category of numbers, unless they have first been reduced to a common genus ", so that " he who calls God one or single ... is speaking of Him inappropriately" (Ep. 50), for he implies that God is one of many. In Spinoza the questions of perishability and of many or other gods are not even allowed to arise. Eternity and one-ness are not attributions that qualify and distinguish. They are entailed by his very conception of God, that means to say, by his conception of infinite substance or causa sui, by " that</page><page sequence="17">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 125 whose nature cannot be conceived unless existing" (E 1, def. 1). " By eternity ", Spinoza says, " I understand existence itself, so far as it is conceived necessarily to follow from the definition alone of the eternal thing" (E I def. 8). The fact, noted earlier on, that in the Ethics Spinoza develops the conception of God from his conception of substance does not make' God 'redundant (as a purely naturalistic interpretation would seem to require), but places our conception of the One Eternal God on a secure foundation. (3) The idea of an izmmaterial Creator is not part of original Jewish doctrine, but was adopted by the mediaeval philosophers from the Aristotelian notion of a prime mover who is pure form. God is invisible but not immaterial. " Scriptura clare indicat Deum habere figuram ", writes Spinoza (TTP c. I). A third area where the Jewish tradition and Spinozism meet is their attitude towards matter: Matter, the extended world is neither illusory nor intrinsically evil. In Jewish religion it is the place of man and by the acts of man can become the place of God. It is the spoken word, the prayer or blessing, and the sacrifice, in short the ritual that hallows the spatio-temporal Here and Now and invokes God's presence. According to Spinoza, on the other hand, the presence of God neither can, nor need be invoked by word or performance: God is present, is immanent in the world. Still, here too, His presence is not given to be perceived like that of material objects-" we do not imagine Him as present "-, but requires an activity on the part of man, the activity of the understanding which perceives things in the common order of nature under the aspect of God's infinite nature. The transformation is cognitive, it takes place in our own minds, but as we realize God's immanence in the world, He is present in ourselves: we are thinking His thoughts.23 23 There is a fourth area where religious thought and Spinozism meet, namely, the doctrines of Jewish mysticism. This is an important subject and relevant to my theme, but so complex and of such wide ramifications that I can only mention it here. P</page><page sequence="18">126 PAUL SELIGMAN VIII Seeing the continuity of Spinoza's ideas with the aspirations of his forbears we should, I think, grant the 'adequacy' of his conception. Naturally, not being based on scriptural revelation or faith, his idea of God does not belong to theology (cp. TTP c. XV), and not being concerned with " human law ", it ignores altogether the social significance of religious notions. It is a metaphysical idea, the approach of an individual to God which also satisfies the demands of his reason. Nevertheless, in view of the practical import of Spinoza's doctrine and its claim to serve life, we are entitled to ask whether ordinary people can live with the Spinozistic God. And this-in the absence of worship and prayer and, more important, of the hope of forgiveness- may be held to be impossible (a practical, not a logical impos- sibility), and it may be denied that there can be salvation by cognition alone. Ultimately, the question here raised may turn on another question, namely whether our emotions can be intellectualized to the extent required by Spinoza, whether Reason has the power, which he thinks it has, and this is largely a matter for empirical enquiry, which calls for separate investiga- tion. But whatever our conclusions on this point, a Spinozist may rejoin that to know God means to know Him better even than we know ourselves (KV II, 19), and that in coming to know ourselves through Him, as utterly dependent upon Him, and in perceiving the eternal necessity of things, we gain the greatest joy and highest possible peace of mind (E V, 27) and need prayer and forgiveness no longer. And notwithstanding the distinctness of faith and reason (TTP c. XIV), the Spinozist, in his turn, may ask whether the individual practising believer of to-day is still able or willing to leave faith and knowledge in separate compartments, as it were. Bearing in mind the past struggles of theologians, the incompatibilities of religious ideas (e.g., the ideas of the perfect God and of an act of creation in time), bearing in mind, too, scientific cosmology, evolution, in short all we now know of the world and of our own minds- -how are we to conceive of God and of our relation to Him?</page><page sequence="19">SOME ASPECTS OF SPINOZISM 127 Is that relation still appropriately expressed in terms of creature and Creator, of child and Father? Not so long ago it was suggested that it might be expressed as the relation of I and Thou? But is not, after all, the Spinozistic conception in terms of infinite substance and finite mode an alternative that deserves pondering? In this context, it would not, I think, help if we were to point to the long philosophical history of the notion of substance with its grammatical and logical associations. Infinite substance for Spinoza is not a technical term or ens rationis, but ' real', signifying necessary existence and power. The substance/mode relation is not an abstract schema but a vital relation of determination and dependence, such as we may actualize in our own minds. It illuminates, as I have endeavoured to show, both our separation from God and our proximity to Him, the union to which we may attain. One feature that Spinoza has in common with Plato and other great speculative philosophers is his deep concern for understanding the finite things of our experiential world in terms of their relation to the 'eternal object' (to use as neutral a name as possible); and the conviction that by means of this understand- ing we ourselves relate to the eternal object. It is the relation that matters. Metaphysical solutions are not merely the outcome of linguistic confusions or logical mistakes. They are sought for their own sake. Certainly, one can always try to avoid them. We are not logically compelled to perceive anything " under the form of eternity ". But I think there is a fundamental human need to do this, and so far metaphysics is anthropocentrically orientated. On the other hand, I would not agree that that need can be met by revealed religion and theology alone. It is a matter for the philosopher also; for in his conception of the eternal object and its relation to the finite, he considers the whole state of our ' natural' knowledge, i.e., of the knowledge we have of the finite. The world which Spinoza relates to God in his modal system is the world as the sciences of his day interpreted it. But the relation itself is unlike the relations which the natural sciences establish. It belongs to the third, not to the second grade of knowledge. Scientia intuitiva is not a perfected kind of ' natural' science.</page><page sequence="20">128 PAUL SELIGMAN Spinoza's last word on this point is that " the effort or the desire to know things by the third kind of knowledge. . . may arise from knowledge of the second kind" (E V, 28). When we know the laws of nature we possess knowledge of the second kind, but when-to adopt an auixilium imaginationis of Spinoza's own-we understand that the laws of nature are the decrees of God, then we have knowledge of the third kind.</page></plain_text>
