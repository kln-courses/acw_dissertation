Since Epicurus rates low in our bibliographies a special welcome is due this neat little study by an able scholar; nor need it surprise anyone that it comes from France, because both France and Italy have been doing more in this field than Britain or America. It is gratifying also that the tone is sympathetic, a good example set by Bailey and Bignone. The scope of the study is limited by its inclusion in a series on Myths and Religions and the slant of the treatment by the author's proficiency in the fields of Greek religion and Platonism. The state of religion in the time of Epicurus is handled with clarity and fresh- ness. New light is brought to bear upon the celebration of the twentieth of each month as instituted by the founder (p. 33 and note 1), though the rest of the biographical sketch is perfunctory. It is only with the third chapter, on friendship, that the author really falls into his stride; the distinction made between Platonic and Epicurean love (pp. 42-43) is both timely and enlightening. The chapter on religion will be welcome for the abundant documentation, especially from the side of Philodemus. New clarity is achieved in the last chapter, which sets forth the opposition of Epicurus to the astral religion of Plato. The rivalry with Stoicism, posthumous to the founders of both sects, is wisely ignored. The learning and acumen of the author, however, have not saved him from errors in this less familiar field. The statement that Epicurus studied with Nausiphanes from the age of fourteen to seventeen (p. 26) is a far-fetched inference and open to cogent objections. The duration of the cadetship at Athens is said to have been one year but Aristotle says two (Athen. Const., 42). Menander, moreover, is named as a classmate (p. 26) and, since by all accounts he was at least one year older than Epicurus, the two can have been classmates most easily on the assumption that the duration of the cadetship was two years. Again, is it possible to be sure that the teaching of Pamphilus and the interval of the cadetship exerted no influence on the intellectual development of Epicurus (p. 26 and note 1) ? If Epicurus ever heard lectures of Xenocrates, as Laertius states (IX, 43), it must have been in this interval, because the death of Xenocrates occurred in 314, eight years before the return of Epicurus to Athens in 306. The ephebes in the first year of their training were stationed around the Peiraeus (Aristotle, ibid., 42) and could easily have attended public lectures in the city during intervals of leave. Lastly, is it justifiable to stress the years of residence in Colophon as exile (pp. 27 and 62) and must we interpret literally the unkind report that Epicurus vomited twice daily (p. 27) ? On some points the author is too trustful of tradition and of editors. It is a good plan to scan all evidence afresh. Did Epicurus really urge his pupils to flee " from every form of culture" (p. 51) ? 317</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Was it not rather " the whole programme of education " ? To ascribe scorn of all culture to the sect is surely going too far. Again, must we emend the text in order to call wisdom " a mortal good" (p. 56) even though the gods delight in it? The MS reads vor7rov, from which we gather that wisdom is "a comprehensible good" while love or friendship is divine, that is, "it passes understanding," a better antithesis. Once more, the author, like Bailey, finds that 7rapa- KLvs8vevoraL XapLv "cannot mean anything" (p. 59, note 3). Why should it not mean " risk an act of kindness for the sake of gaining a friendship "? This is the meaning required. In another passage (p. 113, note 2) there is no need to emend. Usener, Bignone, and Bailey all overlook the fact that kavraaav = -vdapyeav, as Sextus Empiricus tells us (Usener, frag. 247, lines 20-21); the meaning is " scorning those who concede clear vision from distances." It is a mere oversight, however, to adopt a reading in one place (p. 110) that he rejects elsewhere (p. 84 and note). Through following tradition the author falls into the error of regarding Epicurus as "the most prolific of all writers" (p. 50). It is remarkable that this story has so long escaped scrutiny. A very little figuring reveals its absurdity. Epicurus is credited with more than three hundred rolls but the letter to Menoeceus and the Authorized Doctrines run to only five pages each. The letter to Pythocles is a paltry twelve. Even the longest extant, the letter to Herodotus, amounts to only twenty-five pages. Multiply by three hundred and the total is not astonishing. The Roman Varro has been credited with 620 rolls and the average of his books now extant is more than double the longest of Epicurus. The truth is that Epicurus made a fetish of brevity. What else can be the meaning of Sententia Vaticana 26 ? " We must discern that the long discourse and short one aim at the same objective." Lucretius follows the master's example: IV, 115, 176, and especially 890: suavidicis potius quam multis versibus. More serious is the author's separation of the doctrine of the gods from the Canon and the Physics. It is from the Canon that the first logical evidence concerning the gods is to be deduced, as Cicero makes plain (N. D., I, 16, 43). This evidence consists in the presence of a prolepsis or anticipation of the divine nature in the minds of all mankind. Clarification of this principle will be most speedily achieved if first we consider the prolepsis of justice, mentioned in Authorized Doctrine, 38. Aristotle had called man a political animal. How better could we paraphrase this than by saying with Epicurus that man is born with a prolepsis of justice? Do not both state- ments mean that man is predisposed by nature to follow a certain pattern of life and of conduct? If, on the contrary, we agree with the editors and our author (p. 85), who follow Laertius (X, 33) in basing the prolepsis on sensation, we are necessarily placing the abstract notion of justice on a level with the general concept of a horse. Let us now consider the gods. The prolepsis of the divine nature will also rest on the same level as the general concept of a horse, not to say a kangaroo. Surely this is absurd. Cicero rightly hammered heavily on the innateness of the prolepsis (ibid., I, 16-17, 43-45). Our author rightly discerns an affinity between Epicurus and Plato 318</page><page sequence="3">(p. 95). With Aristotle there is a similar affinity at times. He describes with unique pleasure the network of veins " faintly sketched" in the embryo of mammals at an early stage. Nature is compared to an artist doing a mural; just as the artist's outlines are done in advance of the coloring and shading, so nature's network of veins in the embryo precedes the whole organism of flesh, organs, and bones that will be built around them (De Gen. Animal., 740a, 743a). Our author and the editors are astray in rendering V7reypacdr by " engraved" (p. 85). Both the lexicon and Aristotle are against them. There can be no question of " engraving" in the case of the embryo or the artist. What Epicurus has done is to transfer the Aristotelian principle from physiology to psychology along with the telltale item of the preliminary outline. He might very well have said that the adult man's conception of the divine nature exists potentially in the newborn infant just as Aristotle declares the physical creature to exist potentially (SvvauEL) in the embryo (De Gen. Animal., 740a, near end). If Bailey had chanced upon this line of thought he might not have been so sure that the notion of innate ideas was "wholly repugnant to Epicureanism" (Greek Atomists, p. 557). In reality it is fundamental to the system. The second proof of the existence of gods is to be found in the Physics. It is a logical deduction from the doctrine of the infinity of the universe and Cicero points this out with a fair degree of explicitness (N. D., I, 19, 50). This principle of infinitude is not confined to space and matter; it applies also in the sphere of values. If imperfection prevailed in all parts, then the universe would not be infinite. Since human beings are imperfect there must exist elsewhere a number no smaller of perfect beings and that too in an environment where the forces of conservation always prevail over the forces of destruction. The term for this principle is isonomia, a precious concept in Greek history. It is not "equal distribution," as Bailey turns it (Greek Atomists, p. 461) but "equitable division," as Cicero reads it (N.D., I, 19, 50). So far is it from having anything to do with the geographical distribution of animals, such as elephants, that it represents a sort of " cosmic justice." It means that when the overall balance is struck in the operations of the universe the good and not the evil prevails. Man is imperfect but there are perfect beings for him to imitate, contemplate and adore. This may be a grim, materialistic creed but it undoubtedly embodies a sort of justice. The failure to recognize the chief evidences for the existence of gods in the Canon and the Physics has the effect of confining proof to the data of "clear vision," a theory which Bailey has amplified and our author adopts (p. 86, note 2). This means "clear vision" of what is invisible except to the mind and under exceptionable circumstances. Unhappily the evidences cited in support of this theory (Greek Atomists, pp. 438-440, notes) prove nothing of the kind but only afford grounds for believing that the gods are an- thropomorphic. The passage of Lucretius (V, 1161-1182), in particu- lar, was written to account for the superstitious fears of men. Moreover, the gods are there represented as performing feats that no good Epicurean could ascribe to them. Finally, even as an evidence of anthropomorphic form only minor importance is allowed the REVIEWS. 319</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. divine visitations by Cicero (N. D., I, 18, 46). The major evidence was logical, not visual. In spite of these errors this book possesses substantial value. It can hardly be said to break new ground but it does consolidate the advance made by Bignone in his Aristotele Perduto (Florence, 1936). It was the special service of Bignone to set the teachings of Epi- curus in opposition to those of Plato and Aristotle, which were holding the field in his day. On the side of religion our author has assembled the amplest documentation yet made available and his book abounds in judicious observations. Those scholars who still believe that Epicurus and Lucretius were tilting against windmills may profit by scanning his citations from Theophrastus, On the Superstitious Man (p. 72) and Plutarch, On Superstition (p. 77), which was written with Epicureans in mind. The mistakes of our author have arisen through following tradition and the editors. Wherever he is working out his own judgments the reader recognizes keen discernment and abundant learning. The style is clear and attractive and whoever reads part of the book will be tempted to read the whole of it. NORMAN W. DEWITT. VICTORIA COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. Philodemus: On Methods of Inference. A Study in Ancient Em- piricism. Edited with translation and commentary by PHILLIP HOWARD DELACY and ESTELLE ALLEN DELACY. Published by the American Philological Association, Philadelphia, Pa., 1941. (Philological Monographs, X.) According to a still widely held opinion, which is propagated even by Bertrand Russell in his History of Western Philosophy (1945), Aristotle's logic, although quite an achievement in its time, failed to initiate a continual progress towards the "discoveries of modern logic " and was " followed by over two thousand years of stagnation " (Russell, op. cit., p. 195). The adherents of this simplified view of the history of logic still believe in the necessity of fighting Aris- totle's doctrine of the syllogism (ibid.); and, since through Sextus Empiricus (Pyrrh. Hyp., II, 195-197) we know of the arguments that were used by critics of Aristotle's logic in later antiquity, one may say that at least a stagnation of the views of Aristotle's opponents in this field for, cautiously speaking, over 1800 years can be taken for granted. The example for the alleged main function of the Aristotelian syllogism is still an allegedly deductive inference from what is true of "all men" (e. g., "all men are mortal ") to a human individual (" Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mor- tal"); and it is still pointed out reprovingly that our belief in Socrates' mortality is not strictly and in a merely deductive way derived from a major premise that would include every single actual case (which Aristotle never asserted); and furthermore it is still emphasized that we believe in this general proposition " on the basis 320</page></plain_text>
