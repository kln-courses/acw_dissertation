<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism. By F. A. Hayek. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989. 180p. $24.95. The Fatal Conceit is the first volume in a projected 22-volume collected works of the Austrian born economist, political philoso- pher, and Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek. The series will contain his full-length books, a reor- ganization of his published essays, previously unpublished English translations of various pieces, and his correspondence with Keynes and Popper. The present volume contains a short but original set of essays prepared over the last 10 years as part of a projected "grand formal debate" with the leading theorists of socialism under the heading 'Was Socialism a Mistake?" While the debate never took place, the ammunition Hayek prepared to defend the market order now appears in this volume. The targets of Hayek's barbs remain the same: naive rationalists, socialists, and social planners. They believe that the market order is chaotic and unjust and wish to replace it with a system of reason and social justice. Readers of Hayek already know of his views on the evolu- tionary development of spontaneous orders and how the best products of civilization stem from individual actions without those actors knowing how or why their actions contribute to human progress. But Hayek acknowledges that his defense of the liberal order runs counter to the sacred principles of modem thought: rationalism, em- piricism, positivism, and utilitarianism. As he puts it, we have been imbued with a basic set of ideas about what is, and is not, reasonable. It is "unreasonable" to "follow what one can- not justify scientifically or prove observation- ally," to "follow what one does not under- stand," to "follow a particular course unless its purpose is fully specified in advance," and to "do anything unless its effects are not fully known in advance but also observable and seen to be beneficial" (pp. 62-63). In dealing with our social order we have been using "false assumptions about the possibility of justifica- tion, construction, and demonstration" (p. 71) in restructuring and directing our social ar- rangements. The result is a conceit concerning the belief that human reason can shape and control the direction of human progress. In short, these principles (scientism) have been illegitimately used by modem thinkers to 631</page><page sequence="2">American Political Science Review Vol. 84 apply the morality of the microcosmos to the extended order of the macrocosmos. In small groups or tribes where all relations are face to face, it is possible to operate collectively for shared goals and concrete ends. But as human- kind moves beyond the face-to-face troop and into the extended order with its greater dif- ferentiation, individualism, and dispersed knowledge, it is necessary to shift from the morality of the small group (cooperation and altruism) to the universalistic morality of com- mon abstract rules, private property, free trade, and the freedom to pursue individual goals. But the benefits of doing so are not easily understood or appreciated. Hence, we are tempted to operate by designing goals and imposing standards as small groups or families do. However, such goals in the extended order can only be accomplished by the "arbitrary or discriminatory coercion" by those empowered to direct society to those goals. This is the "fatal" part of Hayek's story. As he puts it, "enforced obedience to common concrete ends is tantamount to slavery, obedience to com- mon abstract rules provides scope for the most extraordinary freedom and diversity" (p. 64). Hyperbole aside, Hayek admits that the ad- vantages of obeying abstract rules and operating in the competitive market order are hard to comprehend, anticipate, or prove scientifically. So how can we demonstrate the liberal order's superiority? Hayek tries to deal with this issue in chapters 1 and 2, where he speaks of tradi- tions, customs, and morals as evolutionary human products that are neither innate nor the designs of human reason. These practices lie "between instincts and reason" and are main- tained and followed because they confer benefits widely to those in the extended order. However, there is great confusion about, and misunderstanding of, the importance of cul- tural evolution. In the revolt of "instinct and reason" we tend to succumb to the conceit of wishing to design all aspects of social existence, In other words, we become entangled in an in- tellectual juggling act to clothe the noble savage in the robes of science, hoping to im- pose the instincts of the small group with the power of comprehensive social engineering. Only a rational reconstruction of these tradi- tions and practices can demonstrate how they have evolved and taken root. When and where practiced, success follows; when not, repres- sion and poverty remains. The traits of dis- ciplined work, contract, exchange, saving, risk taking, and several property worked because they are best suited to allowing us to prosper and to meet unforeseen events in a complex world. In the final chapter Hayek makes a rare per- sonal comment on his views concerning re- ligion. As a "professed agnostic" he rejects "every anthropomorphic, personal, or animis- tic interpretation" of "what others call God" (p. 139). Yet religion has played an important role in helping us maintain beneficial traditions in the extended order. By wrapping traditions and customs in mystical authority, it is pos- sible to preserve and to transmit them when a rational defense of certain practices is unavail- able. Historically, support for the family, honesty, and private property have often come from the values contained in religious teach- ings, making the "blind habits" associated with religion functional in sustaining valuable customs. He fails to note, however, that religion can be, and has often been, an enemy to liberal values. The Fatal Conceit is a wide-ranging work con- taining many profound insights about cultural evolution, morals, trade, neo-Malthusianism, and the benefits of the market order. While some will contest many of his broad historical generalizations and will find his views on morality decidedly tilted toward commercial or market values, The Fatal Conceit is an im- portant and original work in the classical liberal tradition, LAWRENCE J.
