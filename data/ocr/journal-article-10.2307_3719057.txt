<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STATUS OF HUGO, ACCORDING TO NEO-KANTIAN AESTHETICS: A STUDY OF RENOUVIER AS LITERARY CRITIC I The interest of the student of literature in Renouvier is likely to be confined to his two works on Victor Hugo.l The aesthetic doctrine on which these works are based has never appeared as a coherent whole, but has to be gleaned from several of Renouvier's writings whose main concern is with other topics. In this article an attempt will be made to analyse Renouvier's aesthetics and to show how this is reflected in his literary judgements. Renouvier's main interest lay, not in the discussion of abstract aesthetic con- cepts, but in the moral implications of the arts. This does not mean that he did not concern himself with aesthetic problems as such: even if one confines oneself to his Critique Philosophique, one finds theoretical articles such as Le principe de l'Esthetique chez Kant, Schiller et M. H. Spencer,2 as well as others such as the review of Hugo's Quatre-Vingt-Treize, where moral considerations are primary.3 But it was chiefly the belief that the ideals of ethics are related to those of aesthetics that led him to a study of aesthetic questions, and his aesthetic doctrines are generally treated as adjuncts to his ethical doctrines.4 According to Renouvier, the study of history shows that, despite the differences in the civilizations of the various races, the ethical problems they had to face were similar during similar periods of their development.5 In fact, he held that from the formal ethical point of view all men are alike in possessing ideals, of which their conduct almost invariably falls short. This ideal-actuality relation constituted for Renouvier one of the most important facts discoverable in ethics. In his own ethical doctrine, the relation consists of the antithesis of the ideal 'society of peace' -a free society of responsible moral agents-and our present society, which he called the 'society of war'.While, according to him, both types of society seek justice, its meaning and the motives responsible for its achievement are different in each. Thus, he maintained, in the present 'society of war', justice is the meticulous balancing of rights and duties, and self-interest the force invoked to see it effected, but in the ideal 'state of peace', to which moral man aspires, justice would be done disinterestedly, leaving room for sacrifice: L'accomplissement de la justice ouvrirait [dans la paix] la carriere au merite pur et par suite au sacrifice... le merite ayant pour mobile l'amour de l'humanite; c'est-a-dire la plus elevee des passions ..., tendrait a se confondre avec la justice, et, la surpassant toujours, 6tablirait le regne du beau par-dessus le regne du bien.6 1 (a) Victor Hugo, le poete (1893); (b) Victor Hugo, le philosophe (1900); these volumes contain edited reprints of articles from his Critique Philosophique (1872-89). 2 6 April 1876. 3 26 March 1874. 4 Chiefly in Science de la Morale and La Nouvelle Monadologie. 5 See Introduction a la Philosophie Analytique de l'Histoire, p. 569. 6 Science de la Morale, i, 321-2.</page><page sequence="2">H. TINT 345 In other words, ce qui s'appelle a present le moral, fin prescrite, serait remplace par le beau, fin spontanee, il serait l'objet de l'amour, et le devoir serait le vouloir.1 It is with the postulation of the ideal of disinterestedness that a link is established between ethics and aesthetics. For, largely following Kant in both realms, Renouvier considered that this ideal is as essential to ethics as it is to aesthetics. In ethics it serves to distinguish the ideal morality of 'peace' from the counterfeit morality of the 'society of war'; in aesthetics it provides the crucial distinction between an aesthetic experience and mere pleasure.2 In both, the sacrifice of self- interest is held to be a good. According to Renouvier, aesthetic feeling is the result of a harmony between some purely formal qualities of an object and the sensibility of the perceiving subject.3 Inasmuch as this implies that the perceiving subject is here not con- cerned with the object as representative of the concrete everyday world, his self- interest will not be aroused by it and his attitude towards it will be one of dis- interested contemplation: Celles [des passions] qui se joignent aux sensations des formes.. . ou qui en resultent peuvent etre generalement exemptes d'interet proprement dit, et leurs fins n'etre pas directement agreables ou utiles, mais demeurer toutes contemplatives. En ceci deja la condition essentielle du beau se trouve satisfaite.4 Inasmuch as aesthetic experiences bring into play the quality of disinterestedness they are morally significant, since they thus foster the highest quality of both aesthetics and ethics. But Renouvier had accepted Schiller's analogy of the aesthetic experience with that of play (le jeu),5 and felt justified in concluding: Le jeu de l'animal est l'emploi desinteresse de ses organes pour la simple imitation des fonctions de la vie qui sont A sa connaissance et a sa portee. Ce jeu est donc de la meme espece, en ce mode caracteristique d'activite, que le jeu de l'homme qui se rapporte au beau, et d'oi nait l'esthetique: une recherche de la repr6sentation pour le plaisir de la representation elle-meme. Les phenomenes esthetiques sont, contrairement a ce qu'on serait tent6 de supposer, situes dans l'animalite A une profondeur plus grande, aussi bien qu'a une moindre elevation mentale, que ceux de la raison, soit logique, soit morale.6 And, thus maintaining the superiority of morals over art, he warned against the dangers of a life in which La morale ne regle pas severement l'aspiration a l'ideal, en ce qu'elle pousse A negliger la vie pratique et ses devoirs en faveur de la vie contemplative... [La] raison, d'accord avec les passions du bien, nous ordonne d'affronter au besoin les laideurs qui ne dependent pas de nous, au lieu de chercher le beau dans une contemplation solitaire, ou d'en realiser quelques elements dans un milieu borne, si ce doit etre au detriment de nos obligations.7 1 La Nouvelle Monadologie, p. 286, ? 105. 2 Cf. ibid. pp. 319-20, n. 89; cf. also Science de la Morale, pp. 266-7. 3 See, for example, Victor Hugo, le poete, pp. 316-18.

If the reproduction is capable of eliciting an emotional response of the type experienced by the artist when he was involved in the original relationship, then he has done his work well. Quand...[l'artiste] considere les objets naturels comme representations, simples d'ailleurs ou complexes, obscurs ou clairs que soient les rapports qu'il y sent avec lui- meme, il les trouve beaux; et quand il s'agit de ses propres oeuvres, des ceuvres d'art, il les trouve belles si la representation qu'il a voulu se donner est fidele ou, plus generale- ment, si en les contemplant il se sent appele a un etat de representation sensible, intellectuelle, passionnelle, morale, qui met en jeu, sans proprement les interesser, telles ou telles de ses fonctions consecutives. De l1 cet interet, ce plaisir, cette jouissance esthetiques qui different des phenomenes ordinaires de meme denomination en ce qu'ils atteignent leur but en eux-memes, ou sous une forme contemplative qui n'implique rien des biens et des maux actifs de l'existence.1 The relative position of morals and aesthetics in the hierarchy of values naturally also has implications for the artist. Not only must he not allow his delight in aesthetic contemplation to obscure his social duties, but his creative work must also conform to the highest moral standards. This does not, however, mean that the artist ought only to imitate that which is moral. On the contrary, that would merely 'vouer l'art au mensonge, ou lui refuser tout sujet serieux'.2 Provided the representation is formalized, there is no aspect of life, crime not excluded, which art need, nor indeed should, ignore: la representation d'art est par elle-meme utile et bonne.. .la verite doit etre observee dans la representation.3 Moreover, [l']art ennoblit et embellit toute chose et toute pensee qu'il transporte dans une r6gion de l'esprit oi il les gen6ralise en tant que representations, et les fait apparaitre comme des verites, objets pour nous de sentiments et de jugements desinteress6s. And since art thus helps us to know ourselves, 'c'est une forme de solidarit6 que la poesie et l'histoire nous creent ainsi avec notre espece .4 In other words, even the immoral, when formalized, enlarges our knowledge, and this Renouvier considers a moral, social act. On the other hand, there are certain phenomena which are not capable of being formalized, and which consequently fail to constitute proper material for aesthetic imitation or feeling: des phenomenes, soit materiellement nuisibles a l'etre raisonnable, soit de perversion morale, [qui] ne pourraient etre suscites dans la conscience representative du beau sans que celle-ci perdit son caractere et que la passion desinteressee qui lui est propre tendit A devenir une passion vive et agissante.5 1 Science de la Morale, i, 258; cf. also p. 266. 2 La Nouvelle Monadologie, p. 322, n. 89. 3 Ibid. p. 321, n. 89. 4 Ibid. p. 323, n. 89. Like Aristotle, Renouvier held that the formalized account of life to be found in art, particularly in poetry, makes it a more valuable hunting-ground for the student of human nature than history. 6 Science de la Morale, I, 262.</page><page sequence="4">H. TINT 347 Thus, nothing is beautiful that merely rouses the passions.' On the contrary, it is only when our passions are purged, when, as well as having our emotions sharpened, they are appeased, that we are in the presence of beauty. The true test for beauty is catharsis. [La] distinction morale du beau et du laid dans l'art (et par suite dans la nature en tant qu'assimilable a l'art) depend de ce que la passion que la representation comporte est ou n'est pas purgee, en meme temps qu'excitee ou rappelee et imitee chez le spectateur. II y a toujours beaute obtenue Ic oit la passion est purgee. LA oi elle ne l'est point, il y a laideur plus ou moins accusee, ou bien encore absence d'impression esthetique.2 A last, important, corollary of this doctrine is the exclusion of propaganda from the realm of the beautiful: Le principe du desinteressement... suffit pour expliquer que les oeuvres d'art perdent en beaute, - conme cela se voit surtout dans le roman, le drame, ou la comedie, - quand l'auteur laisse paraitre l'intention d'instruire et de moraliser.... Car, soit que celui a qui la le9on est destin6e per9oive le faux dans le tableau, ou que le sermon ne lui semble pas a sa place, il r6agira contre l'intention de l'artiste, il ne se sentira pas emu. Et l'art doit emouvoir.3 That is to say, works of propaganda appear-to Renouvier-to arouse extra- aesthetic emotions to such a degree that their formal characteristics fail to impress our aesthetic susceptibilities. Thus, the encouragement of aesthetic feeling by the artist constitutes the encouragement of the basic moral quality of disinterestedness. It may either rest there, and consequently result in no more than the promotion of a feeling of enjoyment from some disinterested contemplation, or it may go beyond that and, in addition, serve to increase our understanding of whatever formalized object is presented to us by the artist. In either case, the disinterestedness of aesthetics is- in the opinion of Renouvier-inferior to that demanded by the morality of the ideal 'state of peace', since the former requires a merely passive disinterestedness of contemplation while the latter demands the active disinterestedness of purposive moral and social action. Although the pursuit of the aesthetic ideal therefore has its moral use, it must not, in Renouvier's view, allow anyone to lose sight of the superior demands of morality. II In the Philosophie Analytique de I'Histoire4 Renouvier makes a rapid tour d'horizon of nineteenth-century French literature. Although his criticism is here rather sketchy, it illustrates some aspects of his aesthetic doctrine sufficiently well to warrant mention at this stage. To begin with, we find him expressing approval of the coldly analytic character of certain modern French novels. The psychological insight shown by Stendhal and Merimee-though inferior, according to him, to that of George Eliot, but superior to the pessimistic outpourings of Balzac- 1 La Nouvelle Monadologie, pp. 520-1, ? 140. 2 Science de la Morale, I, 266; our italics. 3 La Nouvelle Monadologie, pp. 319-20, n. 89; cf. also Science de la Morale, I, 266-7. 4 iv, 485-502.</page><page sequence="5">348 The Status of Hugo, according to Neo-Kantian Aesthetics accorded well with his desire to have the arts contribute to our knowledge of mankind: Le roman que nous considerons comme une interessante creation moderne est psycho- logique et realiste: r6aliste dans le sens eleve et impartial du mot. II est ne en Angleterre &amp; peu pres a la meme epoque que la psychologie empiriste.... What matters, as he had maintained earlier, is not that the artist depict the moral -Renouvier could hardly be favourably impressed by the morality of Julien Sorel or Fabrice del Dongo-but that we should be given a veridical portrait of human psychology. Not a portrait of Julien, the particular, but of the ambitious, energetic, post-revolutionary character in general; for, as Renouvier had tried to show, while the particular rouses the passions and thus prevents disinterestedness, the general purges the passions, promotes disinterestedness, and is capable of enlarging our knowledge of our environment. Flaubert, the author continues, was a pessimist. His dislike of the bourgeoisie- the majority of French society-coloured his portrait of it, and to the extent to which it was coloured, to that extent also was it lacking in realism. While one may, legitimately, detest the bourgeoisie for its crass stupidity, unrelieved by any ideal, if this detestation is reflected in one's art it becomes propaganda, and consequently fails not only in its aesthetic intention but also in its ability to give useful instruc- tion. Nor could Zola be called a realist. [Zola] peche par l'esprit de systeme en un point oh il a subi la contagion d'une manie de notre temps: mettre de la science ih ou il est encore bien difficile d'en faire entrer de serieuse, surtout quand on n'est pas soi-meme un savant.2 In the theatre audiences were revelling in romantically idealist plays, whose failure to portray reality was apparently their principal box-office asset: ...le realisme ne reussit pas A s'implanter au theatre, parce que le spectateur est com- munement idealiste dans l'art... il n'en va pas de mnme pour un lecteur.3 But romantic idealism was not confined to the stage. With the exception of the analytical, psychological writers, much of French literature seemed to have been given up to the picturesquely ideal at the expense of the real. Artistic form and the word (qua word) are worshipped, coherent ideas shunned. All this had led to a dilettantism which, according to Renouvier, called for little culture in the artist.4 Moreover, this type of romantic literature en grande partie s'est signale par de l'hostilite envers le principe du devoir, et par une sorte d'intronisation du principe de la passion; comme si la passion avait un droit anterieur ou superieur A se satisfaire en renversant ce qui lui fait obstacle, pourvu que par son eclat, sa force, et quelquefois de pretendus devouements, elle trouve A s'honorer aux yeux du monde.5 On the basis of Renouvier's aesthetics, such glorification of the passions cannot possibly be the source of genuine aesthetic experience. On the contrary, aesthetic experience presupposes for him the subordination of art to morals, and it is one of Renouvier's chief criticisms of nineteenth-century French literature as a whole that this subordination is but rarely in evidence. Ce qui nous manque, ce dont l'absence explique chez nous le mauvais usage des acquisi- tions de l'esprit, c'est le serieux d'une morale ferme qui nous defendrait contre la contagion du dilettantisme dans l'art, et mettrait nos jugements au-dessus des variations de la mode.6 1 Philosophie Analytique de l'Histoire, iv, 489. 2 Ibid. p. 500. 3 Ibid. p. 495. 4 Ibid. p. 494. 5 Ibid. p. 493. 6 Ibid. p. 487.</page><page sequence="6">H. TINT 349 In his two critical works on Victor Hugo, to which we must now turn, Renouvier applied his aesthetic doctrine with greater precision than in the discussion of general literary trends analysed above. We shall divide Renouvier's analysis of Hugo into three parts, the first of which will deal with his aesthetic doctrine, the second with his practical application of that doctrine, the third with Renouvier's assessment of Hugo's qualities as a 'songeur'. Despite the damning remarks contained in the Philosophie Analytique de l'Histoire, Renouvier had some sympathy with the Romantic revolution in litera- ture, 'une revolution operee contre la raison, contre les procedes logiques de la pensee et de la composition des id6es'.1 Classicism, he thought, had had a most narrowing influence, unduly restricting the choice of subject as much as the manner of its treatment. Victor Hugo, en se livrant [A l'imagination] sans aucune reserve, a donne a la poesie frangaise une jeunesse qu'elle n'avait jamais connue,2 his own imagination possessing 'a un degre extraordinaire la vision des choses non presentes'. Romanticism, in its desire for greater flexibility and 'liberty of inspiration', no doubt constituted for Renouvier the literary counterpart of the moral and political revolution he himself wished to bring about. But his predilec- tion for orderliness, characteristic of a residual rationalism no less than of responsible moral and political thinking, caused him to prefer Hugo's retention of grammatical form and dramatic unity of action to Lamartine's plea for grammatical flexibility and to the shapelessness of many contemporary plays. At least this is how one is inclined to interpret Renouvier's approval of '... on ne doit d6troner Aristote que pour faire regner Vaugelas... ',3 for, on the basis of his aesthetics alone, there is clearly no compelling reason for rejecting the famous complaint of Lamartine that 'la grammaire ecrase la poesie .4 Hugo's doctrine concerning the proper subject-matter of art was, in at least one respect, not unlike Renouvier's own. Maintaining that it was the artist's task to imitate nature, Hugo was at one with his critic in holding that such imitation is not photographic. Unlike Renouvier, however, he went on to suggest that the poet must single out what is 'characteristic' in his object, where his critic has been seen to demand the formal or universal. Although, prima facie, that which is charac- teristic may well accord with that which is universal, Hugo's selection of the 'characteristic' was based on a highly personal Weltanschauung. For him, as is known well enough, one of the basic characteristics of nature was that 'le reel resulte de la combinaison toute naturelle de deux types, le sublime et le grotesque, qui se croisent dans le drame comme ils se croisent dans la vie et dans la creation'.5 Renouvier objected that the 'contraste cherch6 et systematique s'eloigne du naturel dans la plupart des cas, et ne fait pas de lui-meme l'harmonie des elements qu'il oppose'.6 Moreover, the self-conscious juxtaposition of good and evil, or beauty and ugliness, and the exaggeration with which Hugo presented them-the latter because he believed7 that their dramatic efficacy was thus increased-have made the characters of his theatre and novels stridently unnatural, and hence 1 Victor Hugo, le poete, p. 1. 2 Ibid. p. 34. s Ibid. p. 15. 4 Ibid. p. 16. 5 Preface de Cromwell, quoted in Victor Hugo, le poete, p. 23. 6 Victor Hugo, le poete, p. 25. 7 Ibid. pp. 25-6.</page><page sequence="7">350 The Status of Hugo, according to Neo-Kantian Aesthetics incapable of being met with that disinterested detachment from the spectator without which a work of art is a failure. Victor Hugo... a suivi le faux systeme, quand il a cree des personnages et imagine des aventures, a cette fin expresse de prouver quelque chose.1 Furthermore, Hugo's adoption of the Saint-Simonian view of art as a sacerdoce caused him to think of himself as a moral leader ('le poete aussi a charge d'ames '),2 so that his interpretation of the nature of artistic imitation fitted in well with his belief in the mission of the poet. If, to this, one adds Hugo's doctrine of the infinite freedom of genius3-and his not unlikely belief that he himself belonged to that dynasty of the 'immobiles geants de l'esprit humain'4-the picture of the poet of whom Renouvier could not approve would seem to be complete. Indeed, Hugo's 'Plus d'art faineant. La poesie ouvriere de la civilisation.... Nous assistons ... a la majestueuse jonction du beau avec l'utile'5 is countered by his critic's insistence on the essentially disinterested character of artistic production: 'L'art [est] la reproduction imitative et desinteressee, dans un esprit de jeu, par diff6rents instru- ments et differentes methodes, des ouvrages de la nature et des choses de l'homme.'6 But Renouvier recognized that Hugo 'a aussi represente des scenes vraies .. et c'est alors qu'il a ete le plus utile dans l'acception unique ou l'artiste le puisse etre.'7 Despite his criticisms of Hugo's views on the nature and function of art, Renouvier held him to be the greatest of the French poets. This was, partly, because he believed in Hugo's moral seriousness: [Le] principe moteur [de Hugo] et l'unite de tant d'elements souvent contradictoires et pourtant concilies, c'est le sentiment, c'est l'amour du bien, avec cette conviction, toute spontanee, que du sentiment, c'est-a-dire des passions bonnes, servies, exaltees par l'art et le genie, naissent les verites morales et les vertus par lesquelles va se transfor- mant progressivement le monde.8 A not uncommon companion to a philosophy which rejects reason as the supreme legislator, this postulation of love of the Good as the basic principle of morality did not usually find favour with Renouvier.9 But he was at all times so impressed by the apparent sincerity of Hugo's moral convictions and the disinterestedness with which he adhered to them, that he was prepared to consecrate as beautiful various formulations of these views to which he could not always intellectually subscribe10- provided, of course, that these were expressed in a formalized manner. For what mattered to Renouvier was not so much what principles someone was disinterested about, as that someone, in fact, was so. In any case, it will be seen that he dis- covered what seemed to him important similarities between Hugo's moral views and his own. But apart from the moral elevation of Hugo's works, about which more will be said, Renouvier appreciated the poetic achievements which the Romantic revolu- tion in literature had made possible. These are to be found in both the form and the content of Hugo's poetry. Renouvier comments with great appreciation on Hugo's reforms in versification, 1 Victor Hugo, le poete, p. 187. 2 Ibid. p. 145. 3 Cf. ibid. pp. 160 ff. 4 Ibid. quoted from William Shakespeare. 5 Ibid. pp. 184-5. 6 Ibid. p. 188. 7 Ibid. p. 187. s Ibid. p. 194. 9 See, for example, Correspondance de Ch.

TINT 351 as a result of which he had increased the attractiveness of the pursuit of the aesthetic experience: Victor Hugo est un createur en matiere de rythmes; la versification francaise est devenue entre ses mains un produit vraiment nouveau et inattendu du genie de sa langue, de la notre.... 1 According to Renouvier, the three centuries preceding that of Hugo confused the caesura with a rhythmic stress, not realizing that there is no need for a suspension du sens to mark the difference between poetry and prose, if advantage is taken of the rhythmic quality of the language :2 Racine seul parait avoir pressenti les formes possibles pour l'alexandrin, en dehors de la convention etablie.3 Furthermore, Hugo himself was probably not aware of his reforms, which consisted En deux mots... .a placer au milieu du vers, en depit de la cesure classique, un groupe de quatre, de cinq ou de six syllabes, detache des deux groupes extremes par des accents plus forts que ceux de cette cesure, et qui par 1^ donnent le rythme special d'un vers a constitution ternaire, et non plus quaternaire ou binaire.4 But, more than merely increasing the flexibility of the verse, Hugo reconstituted the strophe: Nous voulons parler de cette alternance reguliere, avec des rimes croisees, d'un ou de plusieurs grands vers avec un vers de six ou de huit syllabes, ce dernier formant une chute inattendue ou le mouvement de la parole et celui de la pensee s'unissent et s'arretent sur une image.5 Renouvier considered Sainte-Beuve's judgement, that Hugo was continuing the work of the sixteenth century, to be erroneous and inexplicable, as well as that which sees in him only the successor of Chenier. The latter, like the poets of the Pleiade, treated the caesura exactly as Malherbe had understood it, and even if Chenier dared an occasional enjambement, there is barely to be found in any of these poets even the suggestion of Hugo's strophic architecture.6 Renouvier next examined the manner in which Hugo proceeded to find inspira- tion for his poems. Whereas the classics considered rhyme to be subordinate to sense -which is not surprising, given their belief in the supremacy of reason-Hugo allowed the rhyme to suggest the sense. Thus: Dans le cours du developpement d'une idee principale, demander les idees accessoires non point a la raison, c'est-a-dire aux jugements et aux raisonnements que le sujet comporte, mais bien aux images qui se presentent a la pensee par l'effet des associations naturelles et spontanees des ide'es ou des mots.7 In an attempt to vindicate this procedure, Renouvier made the remarkable state- ment that the classical method presupposes the initial thinking to have been done in prose, and that la traduction en vers rimes d'une pensee nette et fixe est generalement impossible sans chevilles, alterations ou periphrases, dans la langue fran9aise.8 Renouvier adduced no proof whatever for this statement which, without it, is incredible. And, in the absence of any proof, his belief that the element of spon- taneity, which is essential to poetry, is largely confined to the 'imaginative' pro- cedure, loses much force. 1 Victor Hugo, le poete, p. 4. 2 Ibid. pp. 262-71. 3 Ibid. p. 271. 4 Ibid. p. 272. 5 Ibid. p. 285. 6 Ibid. pp. 290-1. 7 Ibid. p. 71. 8 Ibid. p. 74.</page><page sequence="9">352 The Status of Hugo, according to Neo-Kantian Aesthetics On the other hand, one could agree that the association of ideas is capable of suggesting images, and links between thoughts, which deductive reasoning might not have reached. But, if Renouvier considered Hugo's reforms in versification an unqualified success, and appreciated the spontaneous beauty of many of Hugo's poems, he nevertheless was not blind to the dangers of the romantic imagination. He recognized that the development of a poem by the association of ideas can make nonsense of its content. He saw that there are in Hugo many senseless verses, whose sole raison d'etre is to be found in the fact that the last word of the line had been suggested by the last word of the previous line. The word thus acquires the stature, not of a mere vehicle-as in the classics-but of an omnipotent driver: in the Contemplations,1 for example, Hugo speaks of it as a God. And when a word dictates the content of a whole line-which it does here, provided there is an attempt to make sense at all-it may well prompt one to dissert on subjects of which one is comparatively ignorant. By common consent, Hugo's ignorance was not small, and the examples of nonsensical verses to be found in his poetry are unnumbered.2 Moreover, much fantastic pseudo-science appears even in his prose, calling from Renouvier the comment: C'est une faiblesse de parler de ce dont on n'a pas la plus legere notion, mais Victor Hugo eut coutume d'y ajouter, surtout dans ses prefaces, et dans les plus anciennes, un certain ton d'extreme fatuite, avec un etalage de modestie tres pretentieuse, qui pro- duisit un effet d'agacement sur ses lecteurs les mieux disposes.3 He concluded however that these 'defauts, qui sont tres graves,...ne sont pas necessaires', and was satisfied that the 'imaginative' procedure 'donne parfois lieu a de tres heureuses, a de tres belles rencontres'.4 But Renouvier particularly admired Hugo's introduction into his poetry of Christian mythology, whose presence in classical literature, according to him5 would have made the irreligious eighteenth century impossible. This innovation was accompanied by superb anthropomorphic accounts of all aspects of nature, which accorded well with Renouvier's Personalist view of the universe. In fact, Renouvier was so concerned with extolling the virtues of mythology in poetry that he appeared at times to forget the existence of any other poetic subject. Thus one reads with some astonishment: L'imagination appliquee a la poesie, c'est le genie de la mythologie, parce que la mythologie est la forme de construction du langage spontane et primitif, qui person- nifie d'abord les objets de la pensee, afin de leur attribuer l'action et la passion.6 For Renouvier, then, the aesthetic feeling elicited by Hugo's subtle versification, by his rich imagination, by his great mythological gifts and by his moral earnestness eclipsed all his shortcomings, and made him the greatest poet of France. It is not until the second of Renouvier's collection of articles on Hugo, Victor Hugo, le philosophe, that the philosophical content of the poet's work is properly analysed. Renouvier here maintained that the dualism, which has already been noted in Hugo's conception of reality, was symptomatic of the Romantic's instinctive reaction to the popular philosophies of his time. Like Senancour,7 Hugo was optimistic about the future and pessimistic about the present, professing-the 1 I, 8, quoted in Victor Hugo, le poete, pp. 84-5. 2 Cf. ibid. pp. 96-104. 3 Ibid. p. 105. 4 Ibid. pp. 76-7. 5 Hugo quoted, ibid. p. 11. 6 Victor Hugo, le poete, p. 35. 7 Victor Hugo, le philosophe, p. 12.</page><page sequence="10">H. TINT 353 greater part of the time-the same blind faith in inevitable progress as his con- temporaries yet becoming increasingly convinced of the present corruption of man. Renouvier went into some detail about Hugo's development, from his rejection of organized religion, and the early dualistic belief in the splendours of nature and the misery of man, through the sudden fear of nature, to the recognition that creation cannot but be imperfect, since it must needs be less perfect than God. This led Hugo to the new dualism of the co-existence of God and the Devil. But the determinism he coupled with it involved him in paradoxes. For although, according to the Bouche d'Ombre,l everyone will necessarily find his way to God-a further expression of the belief in progress-free will is nevertheless called upon, in La Fin de Satan, to use its liberty to opt in favour of God. No less oddly, Hugo managed to combine a doctrine of historical determinism with a feeling of compassion for its victims, which, in morals, even made him substitute pity and love for justice, and enabled him, further, to indulge in the most savage satire against monarchy and Church. Renouvier felt that the belief in determinism on the one hand, and the issuing of injunctions and the apportioning of blame on the other, showed 'une fois de plus que Victor Hugo ne s'arrete pas devant l'absurdite'.2 But Renouvier, on a number of occasions, very convincingly explained Hugo's use of symbolism and the true nature of his contradictions: 'I1 ne fait, il ne veut jamais que rendre des sentiments par des imaginations et des personnifications'; so that the contradictions which appear to exist in his doctrines-such as the attempt to reconcile free will with determinism-only reflect the painful inner awareness of the co-existence of good and evil in nature, against which 'ces objections ne portent pas.'3 Ce mal, le Satan de Victor Hugo en est la personnification, non la personne. C'est un produit de l'instinct realiste, objectivant une idee generale, et puis, comme il s'agit de poesie, l'accompagnant de tous les attributs propres a la peindre vivante et agissante.4 More generally, Renouvier concluded that Hugo a suivi son siecle dans le dogmatisme de la philosophie de l'histoire, et participe A des illusions, genereuses en somme, mais [qu'il] a refuse de le suivre dans les negations que la logique y venait joindre, et conserve les sentiments de sa jeunesse, malgre son amour de la popularite. Apres cela, la contradiction, comme on dit, ne le genait pas autrement.5 Examining his views on religion, Renouvier found that Hugo's detestation of the great suffering caused by the Catholic Church had not only imbued him with a profound hatred of christianity as a whole, but of all forms of organized religion in general: 'on ne doit l'attribuer qu'i la sincere et trop juste horreur que lui inspirait le passe du catholicisme.'6 But Renouvier did not think that this explanation in any way constituted a justification, and he criticized Hugo severely for his uncritical general anathema. It is in the second part of Religions et Religion that Renouvier detected a ray of genuine philosophical light in a form strikingly similar to his own. Having rejected all religions 'de forme trop determinee, [Hugo] arrive a des pensees criticistes sur 1 Quoted, Victor Hugo, le philosophe, p. 62. 2 Victor Hugo, le philosophe, p. 173; cf. pp. 167-83. 3 Ibid. p. 77. 4 Ibid. pp. 77-8. 5 Ibid. pp. 163-4; cf. also pp. 182-3. 6 Ibid. p. 245. 23 M.L.R. LIII</page><page sequence="11">354 The Status of Hugo, according to Neo-Kantian Aesthetics la lumiere qui vient du devoir'.1 Renouvier quotes these lines of doubtful poetic beauty: Tu dis: Je vois le mal et je veux le remede. Je cherche le levier, et je suis Archimede.- Le remede est ceci: Fais le bien. Le Levier, Le voici: Tout aimer et ne rien envier. Homme, veux-tu trouver le vrai? cherche le juste.2 Indeed the concept of justice has been seen to be the basis of Renouvier's moral thinking. But the similarity goes somewhat further, inasmuch as both Renouvier and Hugo put forward similar views on immortality. Both use the concept as an encouragement to moral action: [Hugo] y joint l'expiation. II est en cela pleinement sur le terrain religieux, aussi bien que sur le terrain le plus etranger A l'ecole positiviste et antijuridique.3 And since the moral efficacy of the concept would be impaired if it were not taken seriously, they both make the prospective doubter think twice by questioning the likelihood of the immortality of those who reject the concept.4 In other words, for both Renouvier and Hugo, justice is here the key to morality, and the hope of immortality the assurance that the key will be used. Furthermore, despite the many pantheistic passages which are to be found in his work, Renouvier held Hugo to be, as he was himself, a believer in a personal God. Even though Hugo had accused the religious doctrines and their Gods of the sins committed in their name by Popes and Emperors, Renouvier warned that [les] expressions pantheistes ne doivent point se prendre au pied de la lettre chez les poetes...[surtout] apres qu'ils se sont prononces nettement, avec reflexion, pour la doctrine de la personnalite divine. C'est ce que Victor Hugo a fait.5 And that meant for Renouvier that Hugo was at one with him in the postulation of God as supreme perfection, the anthropomorphized ideal to which moral man aspires. On the basis of Renouvier's neo-Kantian aesthetics Hugo's stature as an artist is impressive. Apart from his blatant propaganda pieces which, by definition, can elicit no aesthetic response, Hugo's writings are beautiful in that they not only show the moral elevation neo-Kantian aesthetics demand, but also in that they are strikingly evocative of aesthetic feeling as Renouvier has defined it. Particularly in his poetry, Hugo is presented as the artist capable of creating a series of morally significant formal tableaux of man's fate in settings at once delicate and original. That alone would have amply satisfied the conditions of a work of art according to neo-Kantian doctrine. But Renouvier sees more in Hugo. Not only is he morally serious, but his moral seriousness has also been seen to have important affinities with the neo-Kantian conception of morality itself. That, for Renouvier, places him above the merely instructive realist for, in so far as Hugo's writings also contain elements of rational Kantian morality, so far are they in his view also superior to all other writings which are either amoral, or which disinterestedly advance moral precepts of a different kind. It will occasion little surprise that, after such a verdict, Renouvier was prepared to confer on Hugo his most treasured title of all: that of 'philosopher'.6INT H.
