<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION In tackling the issue of justification, philosophers have gone overboard in their efforts to discover fallacies in the reasoning of otherwise sensible people. And having fallen into deep water, those philosophers now find that they do not know how to swim. The cause of such philosophical distress can be located in what may have once appeared as a virtue: the separation be tween man and nature. Science may describe the world, and even us, but it cannot tell us what we ought to do; it may explain how a state of affairs originated and developed, but it cannot tell us whether that state of affairs is a good thing. In this paper I will argue against that separation; and in ad vocating a philosophy that treats man as part of nature, I will attempt to throw light on the issue of justification. The typical philosophical move towards the separation begins with in nocent plausibility. As a philosopher once said to me, "My mother taught me to judge people by their actions and not by their origins.'* This sounds so right that we draw a moral for the worth of our ideas about the world: the genetic fallacy. To that moral we add the dictum that to describe and to prescribe are distinct; and we can now hold, say, that the history and sociology of science are irrelevant to its justification. As Hempel put it, the philosopher should only be concerned with "certain logical and systematic aspects of science which form the basis of its soundness and rationality . . . in abstraction from, and indeed to the exclusion of, the psychological and historical facets of science as a social enterprise."1 This distinction is just as prevalent in ethics, where it also places sharp limits on the philosopher's at tempt to solve the problem of justification. Although the reach of the distinction extends even further, I will limit myself in this paper to two areas: the epistemology of science and the resolution of conflicts of values. As we shall see, these two areas are not independent of each other. Let me begin with the epistemology of science. I will first indicate how the main problem in this area arose from the failure of empiricism, and then I will argue that a naturalistic account can solve that problem. It will then be clear that naturalism yields a genuine epistemology. When the logical approach was challenged by historically minded thinkers, a typical response was that epistemology should be concerned with methodological norms. The philosopher's job was to determine what scien tists ought to do; and thus considerations about what scientists actually do</page><page sequence="2">340 GONZALO MUNEVAR were not relevant, strictly speaking. This typical response, however, was bound to fail for several reasons. One of the most important originates in the requirement of empiricist epistemology that experience ought to take precedence over theory. This requirement would seem pointless, of course, unless we assume a further distinction between theory and observation (the mode of experience by which the world presumably has a say in our choice of theories?this is what made "empirical" science empirical). As is well known, the examination of the history of science, by Kuhn, Feyerabend and others, created serious problems for this distinction.2 Let us consider just one example: the Tower Argument against the mo tion of the Earth. If we drop a stone from a tower, and the Earth moves, the tower will have moved by the time the stone hits the ground. There will then be an appreciable difference between the distances from tower to stone at the beginning and at the end of the experiment (remember that the Earth rotates 1000 miles per hour). But no such difference could be detected. For the stone to keep the same distance it would have to fall obliquely. It is plain to the eye, however, that the stone falls straight down. This fact about the motion of the stone defeats the idea that the Earth rotates. Nevertheless Galileo argued that there was no such fact: the stone does not fall straight down, it only seems to. The real motion of the stone is given by two com ponents, the circular inertia of the Earth, which the stone shares with the Earth, the tower, and the observer, and a vertical motion towards the center of the Earth. The observer detects only the vertical component precisely because he shares the circular inertia of the Earth (just as when traveling in an airplane, we do not observe the person sitting next to us to be moving at 600 miles per hour, but we do observe the nodding of his head as he falls asleep). As we can see, even "facts" as plain as the vertical motion of a stone can be interpreted differently if we make different theoretical assump tions. A scientist can save his view by specifying a different "empirical basis." Therefore experience does not always take precedence over theory. The great problem for empiricism is not that scientists often fail to live up to the methodological norms discovered by philosophers, but that they have to?if science is to advance, that is. The reason is simple. In many of the most admired episodes in the history of science, the winning view was often in trouble with the facts and had to be rescued by challenging their verdict. To have adhered to method would have prevented the great ac complishment?not merely delayed it. From the scientist's point of view, then, epistemological purity is simply absurd. The epistemologist saw ra tionality as adherence to methodological norms. For the scientist, rationali ty was to be recommended because those norms would improve his pros pects of coming to understand the world. But when it turns out that</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 341 adherence to the norms may actually hamper those prospects, the scientist must make a choice between rationality and scientific success. Since the ra tionale for rationality was that success, the scientist's choice is obvious. Nevertheless many philosophers, particularly the logical empiricists, took up the curious notion that epistemology should not have to give advice to the practicing scientists. The job of epistemology was to "explain" science. This "explanation," which was attempted by means of rational reconstructions, was patently aprioristic; but in the last analysis such an ap proach was a pretence. On pain of absurdity, the logical philosopher had to put forth norms consistent with procedures that secure knowledge about the world. But how could he discover such norms? I submit that he "abstracted" them from what he understood of the practice of science. This Hempel has come to admit: explication and the like "were never undertaken in a purely a priori manner . . . [they] were constructed with an eye on the practices and the needs of empirical science."3 The philosopher makes up theories about science just as the scientist makes up theories about the world. In this the logical approach turns out to be indistinguishable from the historical one. Otherwise the main difference is that whereas the second treats the practice of science seriously, as given by socio-historical studies, the first scorns it publicly. It is not surprising that the historical approach was eventually seen as more promising in our wish to understand science. The triumph of the historical approach already undermines the use philosophers make of the separation between description and prescription: matters of practice can be used to pass judgment on matters of norm. That triumph, however, does not take us far enough in questions concerning justification. We might think that all we need to do is base our norms on the actual successful practice of science and we will be able to justify our future decisions by reference to such norms. The problem with this suggestion is that, as Feyerabend and Lakatos point out, a practice may degenerate.4 Moreover, norms based on practice require that we take the word of an ex pert elite; for only experts will be in a position to determine whether the changes in the practice are for the best. This situation brings up one of the many ways in which a practice may degenerate: overwhelming success may drive the elite to complacency and over-confidence. Since universal norms seem unlikely, given the breakdown of the distinction between theory and observation, we may conclude that different methods and procedures would be appropriate in different circumstances. As epistemologists, we must now determine whether science has a strategy that will increase its chances of coming up with such methods and pro cedures when circumstances demand. And all the while we must guard against simply trusting the judgment of a possibly stagnant elite. This is the</page><page sequence="4">342 GONZALO MUNEVAR problem that the new epistemology of science must solve.5 In that solution lies the key to the issue of justification. This is also the problem that a naturalistic approach can solve. Of course, not all naturalistic approaches will do. What I have in mind is a naturalism that begins with the genesis and development of the skills that make science possible. If this plan sounds like a recipe for committing the genetic fallacy so much the better; for we will then come to realize the limitations of the philosophical injunction against considerations of origin. We will come to see that in understanding the genesis of science we will understand its nature; and that in understanding the nature of science we will find the means to settle the question of its rationality. Since the epistemology that follows is both naturalistic and evolutionary, I would like to point out briefly how it differs from views that the reader may tend to conflate with it: standard evolutionary epistemology and Quinean natural ized epistemologies. Once philosophers learned well that universal standards or norms do not rule the manner in which the content and procedures of science change, their efforts were directed towards showing the development of science was rational. To this end it occurred to Popper, Toulmin, and others that the history of science was like natural history.6 Scientific ideas, or populations of scientific ideas, evolved somewhat in the manner in which neo Darwinism says that populations of organisms evolved. This analogical ap proach fails to meet my purpose on several counts. First of all, it is not real ly naturalistic. Human thought and nature still go their separate ways. In Popper's account, for example, the selection of ideas takes place not in nature but in some metaphysical Third World that rivals Plato's Forms. Se cond, even if a close analogy holds, neo-Darwinism does not entail that the history of science is rational. Darwin himself made it very clear that there was nothing rational about the evolution of species. I do not wish to say that science is like nature but that it is part of nature. Apparently, however, a straightforward naturalism, must face anew the problem of the distinction between describing and prescribing. For a naturalistic epistemology is presumably descriptive, and no matter how good the description is, a logical gulf would still separate it from the nor mative domain. Therefore a naturalistic epistemology would have little to tell us about justification. In this argument we find a source of disenchant ment with Quine's proposal to naturalize epistemology.7 Granted that he was right in suggesting that, since the positivists' logical reconstructions of scientific knowledge were dismal failures, it made more sense simply to in quire into how science is actually generated. But a philosopher may still</page><page sequence="5">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 343 want to ask whether that science is rational, no matter how many Wittgen steinian appeals he hears to grow up and forego certain questions. I think that the urge to ask such questions is properly philosophical; but in opposition to the common wisdom, I also think that naturalism is the way to satisfy it. I start from two plausible conjectures: that science is a social product of intelligence, and that intelligence depends on the brain. Since the brain is to be explained by evolutionary biology and neuroscience, I shall take my cues from those two sciences. Intelligence arises out of perception and other biological structures and its adaptive features are directly connected with the characteristics that distinguish it from those structures. Intelligence, as Piaget has remarked, allows us indirect responses to the world, it frees us from having to respond merely to the immediate and pressing demands of the environment.8 This psychological account of in telligence accords well with our understanding of the evolution of its neural basis. As the complexity of the central nervous system increases, so does the ability to treat information in a variety of ways. For such complexity often includes many connections between different sense modalities, as well as structures to coordinate the senses with other functions of the central ner vous system. The result is that in humans, for example, we do not simply see with our eyes but with our whole bodies. What we see depends on internal senses that factor the position of the body in perception (so the image of our audience remains stationary even though we move), on what we smell, taste, or hear (as the shapeless bundle in a dark street instantly becomes a guard dog when we hear that nasty growl). What we see also depends on structures of the brain that aim at constancy. Thus, for example, we see a circle that is partically turned away from us still as a circle and not as an ellipse. Expecta tion and the success or failure of behavior also play a major part. For in stance, a subject looking at a distorted room (in which the left wall is much longer than the right) through a peephole will see it as normal?square, that is. When he is asked to touch with a stick an object on the wall, he will fail repeatedly; but then suddenly his perception of the room will change and he will see it as it is. We realize both at the psychological and neural level that information can be rerouted, stored, compared and transformed in a great variety of ways. This complexity of the central nervous system underlies the ability for indirect action. And nowhere is that ability better illustrated than in curiosi ty. Curiosity is a form of play, more specifically of play with the environ ment. In exercising its curiosity, as in other forms of play, an organism in curs a variety of risks. In general the curious animal is not responding to im mediate pressures of the environment: it is not eating, mating, escaping, or</page><page sequence="6">344 GONZALO MUNEVAR looking for shelter; nor is it paying enough attention to the possible predators. Why should curiosity have evolved then? The most sensible answer, it seems to me, is that in spite of the initial risks, curiosity offers a great pay-off later in life. In their play with the environment, rats, ravens, apes, and hominids rehearse many skills, simply and in combination, that may later be of great use in dealing with their environment. In play for its own sake we enhance our bodies and central nervous system's ability to deal with a great variety of circumstances. And playing with the environment so as to satisfy its curiosity enables an organism not only to get to know its en vironment in ways that will prove useful later, but more importantly, to develop strategies by which it can come to know its environment better. This flexibility of response pays some clear dividends. First, an animal, as we have seen, may come to know its environment better. Second, a species of animals can move into new niches, for its curious young can then adapt to a wide range of environments. Third, organisms which remain curious throughout their lives can better deal with a changing environment. Curiosity, in short, makes organisms more adaptable.9 I do not mean to suggest that curiosity is the only way by which an organism can become highly adaptable. A characteristic is adaptable or not in part because of the way it fits in with other characteristics. An opposing thumb is adaptable only for animals with the appropriate skeletal structures and neural coordination. It was a considerable advantage for our ancestors, it would be a hindrance to horses, and a fly would have no place to put it. Likewise, the increase in complexity of the central nervous system required for curiosity is adaptable only for animals that can afford the concomitant increase in metabolism. In some cases an increase in size is necessary as well. But that increase may be fatal to animals that survive by hiding from their predators in small places. An increase in the complexity of the central ner vous system served our ancestors well because of the kinds of animals they already were. But for different kinds of animals natural history can provide other routes to adaptability. As the sophistication of curiosity increases, the attempt to satisfy it eventually becomes science. In humans, intelligence takes many social forms, and curiosity is no exception. Just as we came to hunt in groups we have also come to satisfy our curiosity about the world in groups. In this social extension of intelligence we find the genesis of science. That the at tempt to satisfy curiosity becomes social is not surprising. Often the task is just too large or demanding for a single individual. Not only greater numbers are necessary, but a division of labor must be instituted (in con temporary science many projects require an ensemble of experts from many different fields). Furthermore, certain lines of investigation cannot even be</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 345 started by an individual unless there is a prior institution of science commit ted to his training and employment in certain ways of viewing the world (could a member of an isolated hunter-gatherer society devise means of detecting heavy leptons? How could the thought even occur to him?) This social telescoping of curiosity increases, it seems to me, the already considerable adaptability offered by curiosity. Most of the readers of this journal live in the Northern Hemisphere, at latitudes where beings identical to homo sapiens in all respects but intelligence could not possibly survive. Tall, hairless bipeds like humans needed intelligence to make fire, clothing, and shelter. Intelligence permitted them to move into the new en vironments of the cold north and to adapt when those environments changed as the ice ages came and went. Today social intelligence, in the form of science, permits their descendants a far greater degree of comfort and many new ways of interacting with the environment. It also permits them to move into hitherto forbidden environments, such as Antarctica and outer space, and in general to expand the niche of humankind. The social satisfaction of curiosity, like the individual one, brings about also an increase in risks. But the new risks do not preclude adaptabili ty in the social case anymore than in the individual case. Many a young animal has perished in its pursuit of curiosity, but we may still say that curiosity made that type of animal more adaptable. On the whole the ad vantages are there. A full argument for the advantages of science would be beyond the scope of this paper (although I have taken it up elsewhere).10 In any event, as we will see, such an argument is not truly necessary for the purposes of this paper. Let me restrict myself, then, to the biological notion of adaptability: a more thorough interaction with the environment, and the ability to deal with new or changing environments. These are prima facie advantages?and science does offer them. This evolutionary account of science does not imply that science is somehow inevitable. Many of our natural talents go undeveloped, in spite of the advantages they might confer upon us. Science need not be an excep tion. We could do more science, we could do less, perhaps we could do none at all. We could do science badly, we could do it well. Since doing science well would confer the advantages already mentioned, it seems only sensible that we should wish to do it well. Indeed, it would be rational to do so, in a straightforward means-end analysis of rationality. To do science well would mean, in my account, to do it so that science will permit us to deal with new and changing environments, and so on. To determine how science can do this is to determine what it would take for science to be rational (since it would specify the means by which science can attain the desirable ends it has to offer). The first step, given my evolu</page><page sequence="8">346 GONZALO MUNEVAR tionary account, is to treat seriously the notion that science is essentially a social enterprise. Accordingly, the question of its rationality should be asked of the scientific enterprise as a whole. To try to settle this question in the traditional manner, i.e., by examining the behavior of individual scien tists, is a logical mistake. The rationality of science should not depend on whether this or that famous scientist adhered to this or that set of meth odological norms. We should rather be concerned with whether science is socially constituted so as to achieve its ends. Similarly when we wish to determine whether a basketball team is good we look at the organizational and social relations that the team's members exhibit during the game. As any sports fan knows, the team with the most talented individuals on its roster need not be the best. Just as my evolutionary account indicates that rationality ought to be a social property of science, if it is a property of science at all, it also suggests what the social or organizational structure of science ought to be. Scientific views are characteristically built up with the aim of explaining some area of experience, and thus they are constrained in many important respects by our range of experience (even though they always have consequences beyond that range). In my jargon, scientific views are designed so as to fit a certain environment (or rather to allow us to fit a certain environment). But ideas that work well in one domain of experience may be completely inap propriate in others. If we are to deal with new and changing environments, it pays to have at our disposal a variety of ideas and modes of thought. In this manner science can better meet the challenge of attaining its ends. Science must then be organized so as to permit the generation of alternative ideas. Nevertheless the freedom to generate new ideas, and perhaps the en couragement to generate them, is not enough. Ideas are born small; they need time and effort to develop into full-fledged alternative points of view. Some scientists must then be permitted the freedom to develop those ideas until they can compete with older views. That is, science must permit that some of its members stick to their views in the face of intellectual un popularity and even in the face of contrary evidence. The reason is two fold. First, as we have seen, a view in trouble with the facts may still be rescued by the generation of a new empirical basis. Second, even when the scientist is not able to generate a new empirical basis outright, he might take comfort from the following thought: the observations used to judge his theory are interpreted in some auxiliary science (e.g., hypotheses about astronomy are judged on the basis of complicated telescopic operations that span a variety of fields in physics, chemistry and computer science?the</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 347 distinction between main and auxiliary science is like that between foreground and background: it shifts as one looks elsewhere). These aux iliary sciences have reached an accommodation with the main view, normal ly after long struggles. A truly radical new view is thus likely to conflict with views in equilibrium with its established rival. It seems, then, that disagree ment with the facts can be a sign of progress. This second requirement of scientific freedom stands Goodman's plea for entrenched theories on its head; but it should not be taken to mean that all views are on a par. The scientist who is permitted to work on unpopular views has not thereby gained parity: his work is still ahead of him. Most hunches will lead nowhere; and it is not easy to develop a hunch to the point that the original vision becomes commanding enough for others to share. Hard work and in genuity in a climate of freedom, however, will provide science with the flex ibility it requires to allow us to deal with new and changing environments. That is to say, if science is organized so as to meet these two requirements of freedom, on the generation and development of alternatives, it will increase the chances of attaining its ends. My evolutionary account thus solves the contemporary problem of the rationality of science. For in the optimal social organization of science we find a strategy to increase our chances of developing appropriate ideas, pro cedures and methods to meet the demands of changing circumstances. And this strategy works while undercutting the authority of an elite whose rigid control would lead to the stagnation of science. Of course the question of how science ought to be organized is dif ferent from the question of whether it is so organized. Thus the question of what it would take for science to be rational is different from the question whether science is in fact rational. But now we can guide our empirical studies of the practice of science. And I would be rather optimistic about the answer. The worst historical case against the rationality of science was Feyerabend' s. But we may notice that my two requirements of freedom are very similar to his principles of proliferation and tenacity. To those familiar with the literature in the epistemology of science, those requirements are echoes of arguments by Toulmin, Lakatos, and others who have insisted on the generation of alternatives. Insofar as their accounts were based on acute observations of the history of science, the parallel should be expected if science indeed comes close to what it ought to be (in my evolutionary ac count). The interpretation of results may be different, though. For Toulmin, for example, the generation of alternatives is necessary for his Darwinian analogy. For me it is a requirement that science must meet to in crease our adaptability. What seems like anarchy (in Feyerabend's account)</page><page sequence="10">348 GONZALO MUNEVAR under a conception that equates individual rationality with adherence to norms, now seems like appropriate structure, and thus rational, under a social conception born from my evolutionary account. Incidentally, the need to meet my two requirements partly explains why science is not inevitable. Satisfying our curiosity may be part of nature. But to do it well in a social manner would require a degree of freedom that many cultures would find intolerable. This is not to say that science can only grow in free societies. Tyrannies may permit freedom of cosmological speculation while exerting tight controls elsewhere. But in some other societies freedom of cosmological speculation would lead to the questioning of the religious view of the origin of man and world. Insofar as any such questioning is viewed as a threat to the social cohesion imparted by the society's religion, it will be resisted. As the problem of justification moves from the individual to the social level, it would be a mistake to suppose that individual irrationality becomes social rationality. The two requirements of freedom must be met by science as a social entity. Different individual scientists can pursue different avenues of investigation in accordance with the promise they see in them. They themselves do not have to be open-minded, nor do they have to enter tain alternative hypotheses, let alone develop them. But science as a whole must. Individual rationality still exists but not regarding the choice of theories. It exists regarding the sub-goals a scientist has set for himself; ob viously some means will be more effective than others in determining, for example, whether heavy leptons result from certain collisions of high energy particles. Nevertheless questions of individual scientific behavior and questions about the coordination of such behavior within research groups, and of the interaction between research groups are all important to determine the fine dynamical structures that permit science the meeting of the requirements of freedom. Within an evolutionary context, the psychology and sociology of science can make us aware of tendencies that would lead to the better or worse functioning of science (with respect to at taining its goals). It is not that we accept whatever is done in this or that laboratory or discipline as the way science ought to be. It is rather that we can use such studies to determine which practices tend to, say, do away with the generation of alternatives. As long as these social studies are employed in this fashion, they contribute to a finer determination of what science ought to be like. To add insult to injury (to traditional epistemologists) it turns out that psychology and sociology are by no means irrelevant to ques tions of rationality and hence of justification. What I have done can be summarized as follows. I have given an evolu tionary account of the genesis of science. From that account I discerned</page><page sequence="11">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 349 some important features of the nature of science. From those features I con cluded that science is a social enterprise and that it has certain advantages to offer. On the basis of these conclusions I was able to determine that ra tionality would have to be a social property, and also how science should be organized so as to exhibit that property. That is, from my naturalistic study of the origins and development of science I have come to determine what science ought to be. This result should not be too surprising. After all, Plato in the Republic tried to describe the nature of justice so he could determine its value. Likewise only by understanding the nature of science can we frame properly the question of its rationality and specify the means by which we an answer it. Some epistemologists may feel uneasy about ascribing rationality when the actions in question are not the result of deliberation. Rationality, they would demand, should result from the careful, certainly conscious, deliberation about the means required to achieve desirable ends. But in my social conception, rationality is divorced from any such conscious delibera tion. Their uneasiness should subside when they remember that until recent ly the very task of philosophy of science was rational reconstruction, and thus the rationality of science could not have depended on conscious deliberation by scientists but presumably on standards which, according to Lakatos, scientists applied "sub- or semiconsciously".11 In any event the means-ends analysis of rationality is compatible with the absence of con scious deliberation. Imagine that on a narrow road a man sees a speeding car about to hit him. He throws himself to the left, where he lands on grass, rather than to the right where he would have landed on rocks. He believed that grass is softer than rock and hence a better place to land in an emergen cy, though he may have never consciously formulated this belief. Any in dividual may acquire many beliefs about his environment without ever flashing them across an inner mental screen, let alone deliberating about them (we might eventually tell that he has some such beliefs by his behaviour towards that environment). Now, in order to achieve some par ticular goals the individual may come to act upon those beliefs. The ra tionality of his actions would depend on whether acting on such beliefs was an appropriate means to his ends, not on whether he consciously deliberated about the whole process. We must now consider an important consequence of my approach to epistemology. The rationality of science depends on the desirability of ends that it has to offer us. And although our values may lead us to see adap tability as a good thing, it is clear that we also have many other values with which the practice of science may conflict. Why should the values associated with science take precedence over conflicting social and moral</page><page sequence="12">350 GONZALO MUNEVAR values? As we can see, epistemological questions lead naturally into ques tions of social theory and ethics. This connection between such distinct areas of philosophy would not be welcome by many epistemologists. It is bad enough to skirt the muddy waters of the rationality of science without having also to trample through the foggy swamps of ethics. Once more, however, we receive guidance from a naturalistic approach. In this century philosophers have tended to separate nature and value. In one respect this is a very strange attitude, since it appears plausible to suppose that all living things favor some objects over others by the mere fact that being a form of life means engaging in the world in some ways but not in others, taking advantage of some chemical arrangements while avoiding others. More complex forms of life have clear likes and dislikes and display emotions accordingly. The dog values the affectionate word of his master while viewing with suspicion the gait of the stranger coming to the door. If this sounds too anthropomorphic for comfort, let me speak in stead of proto-values in animals. But whatever divine final step turns those proto-values into values when we come to humans, it seems clear to me that the very kind of organisms we are predisposes us to find some things impor tant and desirable while others we will be inclined to find of little worth. I do not mean to suggest that our values are hard-wired in our genes, for our development is very flexible, much of it takes place out of the womb, and is thus likely to be heavily influenced by the social environment. For humans and for many other social animals, the social environment becomes the most important factor in their development (even physically, many animals do not mature normally if they are deprived in early life of the typical social interactions of their species). Even in matters of justification there seems to be at first a plausible connection between nature and morality. To justify one's judgment in ethics, as Peter Singer correctly points out, is to give reasons that take into account not only our own interests, but those of others whom we wish to convince.12 Realizing that our own interests do not have greater stand ing just because they are our own (as far as others are concerned) is the key to justification. Values, furthermore, are closely tied to interests in a straightforward manner, for how would values motivate us to action if they are independent of our needs, desires and hopes? This is why appeals to values, via interest, give reasons for action. To fail to give equal weight to the interests of others is to fail to appeal to their interests, and thus to fail to motivate them in the desired ways. But of course, our needs, our desires, and even our hopes are to a large extent influenced by our nature.</page><page sequence="13">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 351 The cause of the present separation between nature and value is that philosophers think of the resolution of conflict of values in terms of an in ferential model. Statements about nature would be the premises, and from such premises no conclusion containing statements about value may follow. For as Hume presumably showed, facts and values belong to distinct logical categories. Actually Hume did not show any such thing. It just struck him as evident. And part of a philosopher's education is to come to be struck in the same manner. But even if Hume's point is logically unobjectionable, the use that philosophers make of it is not. Peter Singer, for example, accuses E. O. Wilson of committing the naturalistic fallacy because Wilson believes that biology can give us new values and justify some of the values we hold. For Wilson, however, the issue is not whether he can derive values from facts, but whether changes in biological knowledge can lead to new values. These two issues may appear similar, but there is a world of difference between them. We all know of cases in which obtaining information about somebody or something leads to a lower or higher evaluation. The standard philosophical response to such examples is that knowledge has not changed our values but has merely made us realize what values we held all along. Thus I run away from the charging bull not because I have suddenly acquired a value that motivates me to run but because the information that the bull is charging me brings in to action my long-held value in favor of survival. The situation, however, is not that simple. Imagine that a black man has grown up hating Whites because he believes that when he was a little child a group of white men drowned his father purely for amusement. This is what the aunts who have raised him have told him; and there is no reason for him to doubt their word, since he has observed firsthand the terrible treatment of blacks in the Southern United States during the 1950's. This man's hatred gets the best of him, and he begins to murder whites. Once he is caught he expresses no remorse?he has very negative values about whites. Some time later he learns from a source he trusts the particulars of his father's death. His father actually was friends with whites. At a picnic with his white friends he fell in the water and drowned. Three of those friends also drowned trying to rescue him. Now, this black murderer may come to change his values precisely as the result of his receiving this infor mation. But Singer denies that any change of values has taken place. Accor ding to him, the following sort of inference describes the change in the man's behavior.13 The man held all along that anyone who would drown another for amusement must be evil (and so must be other members of his race). This proposition which embodies his real value serves as the major</page><page sequence="14">352 GONZALO MUNEVAR premise in an argument. The minor premise is that whites drowned his father for amusement. The conclusion is that whites are evil. This conclu sion, according to Singer, does not express a basic value. The black murderer gives up this conclusion, then, when he finds that the minor premise in the argument is false. I find this inferential account of value very implausible; among other reasons because Singer and I agree that values are the sorts of things that motivate us to action; and the only value expressed in this argument, if Singer is correct, can hardly prompt murder. Moreover, if it did, it seems that anyone else who accepts the two premises should also be inclined to murder. Some psychological supplement may perhaps be offered to strengthen Singer's position, but I think that a much more straightforward account is at hand. The black murderer has a posture of extreme hostility towards the world, and particularly towards whites. This posture comes from having come to think of himself as a victim, as a man who has been robbed of the love of his father by the sadistic whims of white society. His life has been destroyed from the beginning and having thus nothing to lose he asserts himself by brutal revenge. Learning how his father really died does away with the reason for his posture. He has been a victim indeed: of a lie. New knowledge changes his view of himself and his relation to the world. That is why he is likely to change his negative values toward whites: those values do not fit in with his new perspective. This analysis of my example suggests a causal model not only of the origin but of the justification of value. To see the point clearly let me consider a second example. The North American Indians presumably held a high regard for the environment as a cardinal value. Nevertheless, I imagine that they probably did not arrive in North America with that value firmly established in their culture (indeed many species of big animals became extinct as the result of the human inva sion). As they came to adapt to the new environment, a form of that value arose and developed slowly in interaction with the Indians' ideas about their new world and their place in it. After a long time a whole network of beliefs about the world and about themselves came to cohere with a set of ap propriate values. Given their beliefs, those values were essential to their well-being and probably to their survival. I suggest that this causal model applies quite often in individual and social cases. To explain the origin and development of a value (the genetic fallacy again!) may well amount to explaining why it coheres with a network of beliefs about the world. If that network is deemed acceptable we may thus find the value justified. If the relevant views of the world have been undermined, however, the values may come into question; for they may</page><page sequence="15">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 353 now fail to cohere with the emerging alternative views of the world. An ex ample of the first situation we find in the case of the American Indians. An example of the second, in the case of the black murderer. Values may also be criticized by being made to conflict with other values in the network. Our set of values is always potentially inconsistent (in places it may also be formally inconsistent). What I mean is that values arise in connection with our dealings with certain areas of experience. We are complex beings, however, and other circumstances lead to the development of other values. Conflict between these two subsets of values may never arise unless new circumstances bring about a tension between the two ways of behaving towards the world. We may, however, criticize some values or defend others by either pointing to an already existing inconsistency or by making a plausible case that a potential inconsistency will become actual and it would be advisable to make a choice now. The reason for choosing one way rather than another is that the arrangement of the network consis tent with the first is on the whole deemed more likely to produce fruitful behavior. The philosopher in search of justification must then become a rhetori cian in the best sense of the word. His aims to persuade are satisfied only by an account that maximizes the interaction between human nature and the world. A justification that appeals only to a narrow group of desires and in clinations can be easily challenged by pointing to unwelcome disruptions elsewhere in the network of beliefs and values. A decision to prefer a par ticular arrangement of the network is based on a valuation of that arrange ment, of course, and that valuation is itself open to criticism. My references to human nature, and the values thereof, should not be interpreted to mean that there is a fixed, ultimate court of appeal in the resolution of conflicts of values. Seemingly basic tendencies give rise to values in a variety of ways, and those values may also be challenged by arguing for a further rearrange ment of the network of values and views of the world. But the freedom to challenge any such arrangement does not put all arrangements on a par. The situation is the same here as it was in the epistemology of science: the hard work still is ahead of us. In the resolution of conflicts of values, the task of justification is thus very complex. To carry it out successfully, the philosopher is well advised to understand how human nature lays out the pathways and limits within which justification may operate. Let me explain. It may be thought that biological, and perhaps social, factors influence morality only at what we may call the level of conduct. At a deeper, theoretical level we find the basic principles of justification (e.g., the principle of utility). At this level, however, biology has nothing to tell us (nor psychology, nor anthropology,</page><page sequence="16">354 GONZALO MUNEVAR nor history). There is no biological discovery that could possibly count against the principle of utility. Nevertheless, once again, a little biology takes us a long way. Indeed, it takes us far enough to put clamps on the principles of impartiality and utility. The principle of the impartial consideration of the interests of all con cerned would lead us to realize that our individual interests do not count more than the interests of others in our group just because they are ours. Similar considerations will apply to the interests of our group with respect to those of other groups, of our society with respect to those of other societies, and so on. In this manner, Singer points out, we expand the circle of ethics. Nevertheless Singer recognizes some problems with the universal expansion of the circle. The main problem is that it may do too much violence to human nature by ignoring the special obligations that we feel. We cannot be expected to act upon a morality that would have us treat our own children no better than we would treat strangers. This would be a morality suitable for "disembodied spirits" only, as Wilson has remarked. If human nature, in spite of its plasticity, strongly prefers to run down some streams rather than others, it would do us well to understand the lay of the land. Accordingly we restrict the principle. We now wish to say that our need to act in a special way towards our own children does not count more than the need the next fellow feels to act in a special way towards his own children, just because it is our need. With this restriction upon the principle of impartiality, we are now ready to understand the influence of biology upon other basic principles of morality, or perhaps, I should say, of ethics. The best way I know to apply the principle of impartiality is to use John Rawls's veil of ignorance, both to choose a fair society and to decide on the right individual action to take in case that the general moral structure does not provide sufficient guidance.14 Now, in choosing the basic social and moral principles by which a society is to organize itself, agents who would not know what position they are to occupy in that society would find it in their best interest to prefer a fair arrangement, so as not to be unduly vic timized and so as to maximize their lot regardless of their actual position. Behind such a veil of ignorance, thus, a sensible person would choose a social arrangement that would permit the maximum amount of individual freedom compatible with equal freedom for others. A sensible person, however, would reject the principle of utility. The reason is that the princi ple of utility tells us that the right action is that which produces the largest balance of happiness over unhappiness; but the principle is neutral as to whose happiness is enhanced. Thus utilitarianism would permit a great deal of unhappiness for any one person in order to pay for the happiness of others. According to Rawls, impartial consideration of interests will be</page><page sequence="17">EVOLUTION AND JUSTIFICATION 355 assured because each agent will be trying to maximize his chances under the special conditions of the veil of ignorance. But no agent is going to agree to an arrangement under which his happiness may be completely ruled out from the start. This is why the principle of utility would be rejected. As Rawls has pointed out, it cuts too much against the grain of human nature. Singer has argued that if the principle were rejected on these grounds we would be implying that it would make people too unhappy to use it. But in that case we would still use a consequentialist, indeed utilitarian, criterion for what we ought to do.15 His argument misses Rawls's point, though. The point is that, in trying to secure impartiality, it is not sensible to employ the principle of utility. This conclusion is satisfying enough in that it gives a most crucial role to naturalistic considerations. But naturalism goes even further than that. Normally when we talk about the relationship between biology and ethics we deal with the same human biology and ethics. Let us consider what might happen if we vary one of the factors. Imagine the sort of morality that rational ants might have. By rational ants I simply mean that they are roughly as intelligent as humans are. As we know, the biology of ants and other social insects brings about systems of social organization and behavior very different from ours. We may realize also that, as Singer himself puts it, the origin of morality is to be found in the social character of our ancestors. To remain social an organism must, at least in some in stances, restrain its behavior toward others and make some effort in their behalf as well. It is at least plausible to suppose that the different social behavior of the ants would then lead to a different morality. In order to make a firmer determination, let us then place a rational ant before Rawls's veil of ignorance. A rational ant, if Wilson is correct, would abhor the pros pect of individual freedom, since it would cut too much against the grain of its nature to attempt to maximize its own happiness. Thus rational ants would not choose Rawls's principle of individual freedom as a basic princi ple of morality. On the other hand, rational ants would find the principle of utility quite congenial. In crucial respects, then, their morality would be the reverse of ours. The moral of this story is that naturalism indeed must pervade the task of justification, even when we make distinctions between surface and deep levels. We must keep in mind, incidentally, that in my account considera tions about impartiality and the like are to be subsumed under the more general schema for criticising and rearranging the network of values and views of the world. By this I mean that in resolving a conflict of values it is not always enough to give equal weight to the interests of all concerned with respect to the issue in question. In this specific sense of interests, we face a</page><page sequence="18">356 GONZALO MUNEVAR whole network of relationships with other interests, beliefs, and so on. In some cases it may be sufficient to propose parity between the values of dif ferent agents; but in other cases we forego parity and aim instead to have the other agent give up or modify some interests through a rearrangement of his network (which our criticism of some of his beliefs may make urgent). It all depends on whether we share the same interests, as in the case of our wanting to give special treatment to our own children, or not. Both in epistemology of science and in ethics the distinctions and fallacies of the philosophers' invention have become barriers to philosophical understanding. Even if philosophy deals with norms we may profit from a good dose of naturalism. For in understanding how nature made us normative, we gain the proper background against which genuine philosophical questions arise. Our philosophy thus has a chance when we view human thought within the context of natural history. Gonzalo Munevar University of Nebraska at Omaha NOTES 1. C. G.
