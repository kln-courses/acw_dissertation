(Corpus Signorum Imperii Romani, Corpus of Sculpture of the Roman World, Great Britain, I, Fasc. 8.) Pp. xv+46; 32 Plates. Oxford: Oxford University Press (for the British Academy), 1994. ?45. This fascicule covers the counties of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, South Humberside, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. It is a relatively slight affair, with only 97 catalogue entries (three of which are classed as doubtful because of question-marks over provenance or authenticity) and less than 50 pages of text. This reflects the nature of the material, which consists of sporadic (and mostly rather unexciting) finds. The contributors to the Romano-British fascicules have had unequal tasks, depending upon the regions assigned to them, and one cannot help feeling that H. has drawn one of the short straws: many of the pieces which she has to deal with are fragmentary, battered and unprepossessing. In compensation, however, she has a few important and well known items, such as the bronze head from the River Alde in Suffolk, thought to be of Claudius (the rarely published profile view does not, in the reviewer's opinion, favour the identification) and the tombstones of M. Favonius Facilis and Longinus from Colchester, plus one or two pieces which pose interesting questions of interpretation, e.g. a relief of a mounted warrior spearing a snake- like creature from Stragglethorpe in Lincs. (no. 29), the relief of a pair of standing deities(?) within niches from Thorpe in Notts. (no. 18) and the torsos of two figures holding whips from Bedford Purlieus in Northants. (no. 35). H., who is an acknowledged expert on iconography and Roman sculpture not just in Britain but throughout the Empire, is sure-footed in her handling of the heterogeneous material, and this is an excellent catalogue. One can merely question aspects of the organization which are common to all the fascicules. The arrangement into sections of Greco-Roman deities, Romano- Celtic deities, anthropomorphic figures (including portraits), funerary monuments, altars, animals, and architectural sculpture, is not entirely satisfactory, because it is partly iconographic and partly functional, and leads to anomalies. Particular problems arise where function is unknown or there are uncertainties over identification (e.g. some of the 'anthropomorphic' figures could well be Greco-Roman or Celtic deities). The arrangement of deities in alphabetical order destroys the unity of groups such as the three statues from Sibson in Cambridgeshire (nos. 1, 7 and 10). The policy of not separating bronze works from stone is questionable. All these, alas, are faults ingrained in the series, and it is too late to rectify them now.

This handsome volume is based on the proceedings of the Sarkophag-Corpus held in Marburg in 1990. It is not surprising, then, that its contents offer rather less than the title appears to promise - no ash-chests or stele. Indeed, apart from one contribution by Dietrich Boschung partly devoted to funerary altars, and a short contribution by Friederike Sinn on a lost fragment of a relief from the Tomb of the Haterii, the 'Grabeskunst' discussed here is limited to sarcophagi, and then largely to Attic and Roman ones of the first three centuries A.D. Nevertheless within this remit, contributions are varied and wide-ranging. Moreover the contents seem to break down into well defined groups. The first four, for example, are concerned with garland sarcophagi. Fahri Isik and Dietrich Berges deal with the continuity of such sarcophagi from Hellenistic times into the early empire, providing background not only for the apparently anomalous Caffarelli sarcophagus but also for the inner face of the Ara Pacis screen- wall. However, as Boschung shows it was not until the early second century that the main series of garland sarcophagi began in Italy. This theme is taken up by Helga Herdejurgen who discusses the Campanian series, some with garlands and others with confronted griffins. The next two contributions are concerned with mythology. The distinguished iconographer Hellmut Sichtermann discusses the Bellerophon theme on Attic sarcophagi while Margherita Bonnanno Aravantinos looks at the story of Iphigenia in Tauris as shown on various ?

Most satisfactory here is the use A. makes of the reliefs upon a built tomb at Sempeter to reconstruct the fragments from Thespiae, now in Thebes museum. From myth we move on to genre. Most of Nenad Cambi's contribution is concerned with an early third-century Attic sarcophagus from Salona depicting vintaging cupids which provides a parallel to the well known sarcophagus from San Lorenzo fuori le mura at Rome. This is itself fully considered by Doris Bielefeld. Peter Kranz then discusses a group of Roman sarcophagi, related to better-known Attic examples, showing erotes dancing and playing musical instruments; the term 'Komos-sarcophage' certainly seems appropriate to the subject. More general issues of design are dealt with in the following three contributions. First Hans Rupprecht Goette looks at Attic sarcophagi with kline lids. Reference should perhaps be made back to Cambi's paper, for the Salona sarcophagus has a fine empty couch above. Sabine Rogge studies the general chronology of Attic sarcophagi, while Thea Stefanidou-Tiveriou looks at the end of the Attic sarcophagus industry in the later third century. In the last of these contributions revealing use is made of free-standing statuettes, of Eros and Psyche and Dionysos with a satyr, which parallel some of the themes on contemporary sarcophagi. Attention now shifts to private life with papers on the hunt by Guntram Koch and Fernando Rebecchi and other themes, childhood and the feast, in papers by Rita Amedick, Francesca Valbruzzi and Margot Schmidt. These reflect what has been called plebeian themes in art and they are certainly in line with Trimalchio's taste in such matters. They should thus be read in conjunction with a paper from another recent symposium volume (Jane Whitehead, 'The "Cena Trimalchionis" and Biographical Narration in Roman Middle-Class art', in Peter J. Holliday (ed.), Narrative and Event in Ancient Art [Cambridge 1993], pp. 299-325), especially in the case of the last dealing with the sarcophagus of Titus Aelius Euangelus. The volume ends with a miscellaneous collection of papers, Jutta Stroszeck on the dating of the sarcophagus of Julius Achilleus, Theun-Mathias Schmidt on a Roman sarcophagus with scenes of vintaging but also a mounted huntsman, as we here enter the Late Antique world of the Dominus Iulius mosaic in Tunis; in many respects as other contributions here show us the themes are rooted in Roman tradition. Christianity, however, is something new in sarcophagus art though only Arne Effenberger in an interesting publication of fifth-century fragments from a sarcophagus in Berlin, one of which shows Moses receiving the Law, reflects this important area of research. Finally two museum reports should be noted, Francois Baratte discusses a few unpublished fragments from the Louvre. Far more important is the piece by Marina Sapelli on the Museo Nazionale Romano. Here the paper is rightly backed by colour plates which show remarkable instances of the survival of gilding and colour. This article is a warning to us all. The reviewer visits the Ashmolean library almost daily and as he passes through the Randolph Gallery frequently observes sculpture being cleaned. Most colour if it ever existed has doubtless long been obliterated, but this paper does make him wonder whether such fugitive evidence may even now face destruction. Institute of Archaeology, Oxford M A R T I N H E N I G ARIEL LEWIN: Studi sulla citta imperiale romana nelForiente tardoantico. (Biblioteca di Athenaeum, 17.) Pp. 154. Como: Edizioni New Press, 1991. The book makes use of the fact that among the relatively few Late Roman civic building inscriptions, a high proportion derive from military works. It begins with a historical survey of city-walls. L. discusses such topics as the development of the art of fortification, noting for instance that 'proteichisma' makes its appearance in fortifications of Balkan cities early in the fifth century (p. 32). He points out that contrary to the impression given by Ammianus the Goths of Alaric succeeded in capturing a significant number of fortified cities (pp. 44-5), even if Attila's Huns were the first barbarians conclusively attested to have mastered the use of siege- engines (pp. 46-7). The core of the book is argued on the basis of the presentation of a hundred Late Roman inscriptions relating to fortifications of cities in the eastern half of the Roman Empire (pp. 79-98). With the help of this material L. discusses the dates of various circuits, the financing of fortification, and the respective responsibilities of civic and of imperial authorities for the construction of city-walls. He also examines the extent to which wall-circuits of Late Antiquity encompass the whole or only part of the area occupied by the cities in the Early ?
