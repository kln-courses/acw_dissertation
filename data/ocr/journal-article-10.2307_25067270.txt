VARNER Mutilation and Transformation: Damnatio Memoriae and Roman Imperial Portraiture Leiden: Brill, 2004. 340 pp.; 215 b/w ills. $287.00 In the last three decades, scholars and stu dents of Roman art have become increas ingly aware of the fact that a good number of imperial portraits were re?ut or otherwise altered in antiquity, usually because of the damnation of an individual's memory. Me moria damnata, which was generally politi cally motivated, and the resultant reworking of portraits have been dealt with in individ ual articles and as part of larger studies fo cusing on other aspects of portraiture or, more rarely, the destruction of images.1 Var ner's book, volume 10 in Brill's series Monumenta Graeca et Romana, is the first comprehensive work on these topics. Al though his study does not include all muti lated or refashioned portraits of those who suffered some form of condemnation, it has more than sufficient images to provide a clear picture of the issues involved. His study concentrates on portraits essentially from the time of Augustus to Constantine's transformation of the Roman Empire into a Christian one, although damnation did not end with the Constantinian period, as Var ner acknowledges (pp. 223-24). An impor tant and welcome addition to the scholar ship on this subject, this study also provides a starting point for future discussion and reassessment of individual portrait images examined within. Varner's book, a revised version of his 1993 Yale University doctoral dissertation, consists of ten chapters (pp. 1-224), nine separate catalogs of selected individual por traits (pp. 225-88), a selected bibliography (pp. 289-305), an index of museums and collections (pp. 307-16), and a general in dex (pp. 317-33). In his introductory chap ter, he discusses in a broad historical con text the nature of memoria damnata and its effects on the visual arts. The chapters that follow center on individual principes and members of their families. Although Varner is principally concerned with sculptural im ages (both in the round and in relief), he also deals with other media (such as cam eos, gemstones, coins) in which images of the condemned have been intentionally damaged or altered in some way or, by con trast, not affected at all. In addition, he in eludes a discussion of cases in which the name and titles of the damned individual have been obliterated in inscriptions or on papyri, as well as left untouched. The photographs are by and large of high quality, or at least as good as Varner was able to obtain from various photograph ar chives, supplemented by the author's own photographs. It would have been helpful had he repeated in the captions under each of his images the catalog number (when applicable), which would have greatly facili tated finding these images in his nine sepa rate catalogs. In some cases Varner offers only one view of a sculptural portrait head, bust, or statue, even though additional views are often necessary to assess reworking, a judgment that can be very subjective. When many images and views are essential but too expensive to reproduce in plates, authors and publishers might consider providing a DVD that can accommodate the necessary illustrations. Varner's book would also have benefited from better editing. There are a number of inconsistencies in spelling, typo graphical errors, and problems with punctu ation and grammar, as well as some misno mers.2 Varner usually uses B.C. and A.D. for dating, but on occasion we also find "A.C." (as on pp. 8, 22). Despite these flaws, the book is generally well organized and written in a lucid fashion. At the outset of his book Varner rightly points out (p. 2) that the commonly used term lidamnatio memoriae," "the damnation of the memory [of someone or something]," is a Latin neologism created by modern schol arship. Other expressions for the same con cept, however, did occur in antiquity, such as the preferable memoria damnata. Besides damnatio memoriae, there is abolitio memoriae, "the abolition of the memory [of someone or something]," another Latin neologism that refers to the total obliteration of an image. From the literary and epigraphic record we know of a great many bronze im ages of classical antiquity that were melted down, as well as marble statues that were reduced to lime or broken up into small pieces for use as rubble fill in later wall con structions. Varner tends to use abolitio memo riae (as on p. 2 and passim) to mean the not quite complete eradication of an image, so that some trace of the original, no matter how faint, remains. He cites as examples the "Triumph Relief of Marcus Aurelius in the Museo Capitolino in Rome, in which there is still visible the hand of Commodus, who once stood next to his father in the chariot but was later condemned (fig. 142a-c), as well as a relief panel on the Arch of the Ar gentarii in Rome (figs. 158, 159), in which the figures of the later condemned Plautia nus and his daughter Plautilla were chiseled away, leaving telltale signs of their former existence. These large and obvious "hol lows" sent a message to contemporaries, be cause at the time it would have been com mon knowledge who had once been represented and subsequently damned. To my mind, therefore, these reworked reliefs fall in the category of damnatio memoriae rather than abolitio memoriae, since the faint traces of the former images would have spo ken volumes, analogous to Cicero's noted saying (in Catilinam 1.8.37) "Cum tacent, clamant" (though silent, they clamor). Although most of the images that Varner considers were products of politically moti vated memoria damnata, he also speaks briefly (p. 6) about its opposite, consecratio, the official deification of a princeps or mem ber of his family. Important, too, is the re habilitation of memory, as in the case of Nero (pp. 81-83, 85) or Commodus (pp. 147-48). The latter was not only rehabili tated but also divinized by his successor, Septimius Severus, who claimed kinship with the Antonine house to which Commo dus belonged in order to legitimize his own claims to the principate. Particularly useful, under the subsection "Precedents and Parallels" in chapter 1 (pp. 12-20), is the nice sketch that Varner pro vides of the background for the damnation of memory, going back to not only the Ro man Republic but also the ancient Near East, Egypt, Greece, and the Hellenistic world. As he shows, the sensory organs (eyes, nose, mouth, and ears) were usually targets of special abuse or mutilation. Vent ing one's rage on an inanimate statue served as the next best thing to having the actual individual to attack. Some people made almost no distinction psychologically between the person and his or her effigy. The fictive image becomes, in effect, a stand-in for the object of hatred; as such, the image is also imbued with power.3 Although a political motivation could be ascribed to most of the abuse of images in the ancient world before the time of Con stantine and the Christian empire, a notable early exception involves Akhenaten (or Amenhotep IV, 1350-1334 BCE), the pha raon who imposed a monotheistic religious tyranny in Egypt during the Eighteenth Dy nasty. Varner points out (pp. 13-14) that</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS: POLLINI ON VARNER 5Q1 monuments honoring Akhenaten and some times his family "were systematically de stroyed" or defaced. Yet the fact that a num ber of Akhenaten's images have survived unmutilated suggests that attacks on them were not as systematic as believed. Also, the damnation of Akhenaten's memory seems not to have been the work of his immediate successors but rather the result of sporadic vandalism.4 Varner implies that images of the sun god Aten suffered the same destruc tion, but the archaeological evidence indi cates otherwise, since in reliefs in which the image of Akhenaten was defaced, that of the Aten (the solar disk) was not damaged.5 The Aten, whose divinity had been used and abused by Akhenaten, was a traditional god of ancient Egypt, a hypostasis, or mani festation, of the supreme god Amun-Re.6 For this reason, the Aten continued to be worshiped among the other gods of Egypt after Akhenaten's demise. Varner notes (p. 14) that some images were altered over time not because of dam nation of the memory of the individuals represented but because they were no longer of interest. He observes, for exam ple, that numerous images of Amenhotep III, whose memory was never officially damned, were later refashioned into those of Rameses II. Although Varner does not speculate on why Rameses II might have transformed Amenhotep's image into his own, I think we can safely conclude that the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep III (1386-1349 BCE) was of no consequence for the dynastic plans of the Nineteenth Dy nasty ruler Rameses II (1279-1212 BCE). Economic considerations aside, it might be speculated that Amenhotep Ill's images were reused as a subtle way of damning his memory for being the father of the ac cursed Akhenaten. In any case, lack of cur rent dynastic relevance is also a factor in explaining why a portrait of Augustus's much-loved adopted son Gaius in the Sala dei Busti in the Vatican (pp. 69-70, fig. 85a-b) was re?ut some years after his death into an image of the young Nero, who be came princeps in 54.7 Dynastic ideology might also explain why a portrait of Queen Tiye, the mother of Akhenaten, came to be reused centuries later for an image of the Hellenistic queen Arsinoe II (316-270 BCE). Varner postu lates (p. 14) that Tiye's portrait may have been reused for Arsinoe because the Helle nistic queen may have resembled Tiye, whose image would therefore have been relatively easy to convert. However, it is diffi cult to see how resemblance can have been a factor, since Tiye had Negroid features, while Arsinoe was a purebred Macedonian. Moreover, centuries after Tiye's death, with Egypt under Ptolemaic management, there would have been no reason to honor or even preserve Tiye's memory. Perhaps by then, no one even knew who the original portrait represented, especially if there were no longer a surviving inscription to identify her. The reworking of this image may again simply have been economically motivated. Ancient literary testimony reveals a strong correspondence between the abuse inflicted on the corpses of condemned leaders and members of their family and on their stat ues. In the case of males, the general ten dency was to decapitate the individual (the usual form of execution of Roman citizens), mutilate the body, drag it through the streets with hooks, and dump it into a river or some other body of water to purify it. If an individual were slain in Rome, the corpse was sometimes symbolically thrown down the scalae gemoniae ("wailing stairs") of the Capitoline Hill before being dragged off to the Tiber (see pp. 108-9). Elagabalus, whose body was cast into the river, even re ceived the posthumous nickname Tiberinus as a special mark of scorn (pp. 188-89). With the exception of Julia Soaemias, mother of Elagabalus (p. 195), the decapi tated corpses of female members of the im perial family were not dragged through the streets and dumped into the Tiber or the sewer. The ancient authors also provide vivid accounts of the abuse suffered by the statues of the condemned as though these images were living human beings: Pliny the Younger (Panegyricus 52.4-5), for example, describes the destruction of Domitian's por traits in graphically anthropomorphic terms (pp. 114-15). As Varner rightly notes throughout his book, assaults on the images of the wives, sisters, and daughters also tes tify to the power and influence of imperial women in Roman society, despite the fact that they could not hold political office. Varner takes up at various points through out the book the important matter of who attacked images of principes or their family members and whether these assaults were spontaneous reactions (see pp. 9, 199, 204) or responses to orders following official or unofficial damnation. Some ancient sources are unclear while others are specific, espe cially if the army or the urban plebs were involved (as on pp. 200-201). Sometimes the findspot of an intentionally damaged portrait or inscription can provide informa tion about those who perpetrated an attack. For example, the discovery of a mutilated over-life-size bronze head of Severus Alex ander at the military settlement of Carnun tum in Upper Pannonia points to its having been attacked by soldiers, who we know showed support for the new princeps Maxi minus Thrax in 235. Since the historian Cassius Dio was the military governor of Pannonia ("legatus Augusti") from 223 to 228, during the principate of Severus Alex ander, it is likely that Dio set up the bronze statue to which the mutilated head be longed (p. 197). In another instance, an honorific inscription of Diadumenianus, the son of Macrinus, was dumped into the la trine of the vigiles (fire brigade and night watch) at Ostia after the overthrow of father and son. Given the circumstances, it is prob able that the vigiles themselves were respon sible for this act (p. 185). Some information exists about who or what governmental agency was responsible for carrying out the destruction, desecra tion, or removal of images after an official decree was issued. From the ancient literary evidence, it appears that the Senate usually ordered the official damnation (generally at the behest of the new princeps) by issuing a decree declaring an individual to be a hostis, or public enemy (see pp. 95, 109); on rare occasions, the new princeps himself issued the order, as in the case of Caracalla, who commanded the military to destroy images of his brother Geta on the death of their father, Septimius Severus, in 211 (p. 168). In another instance, the Senate was initially prevented by Claudius, the new princeps, from issuing an official decree of condem nation of his nephew Caligula. Instead, Claudius had Caligula's images (presumably those in Rome) removed under the cover of night and later allowed the Senate to order the melting down of senatorial coinage that bore Caligula's image. Any such decree ob viously had its limitations, as demonstrated by the fact that many coins of the damned have come down to us. Nevertheless, as Var ner notes, we find a number of interesting numismatic examples in which the images of the damned were either countermarked or chiseled off (as, for example, figs. 45, 110, I7la-e, I72a-c). Although damnatio might be a factor in some countermarking, we must be cautious here, since counter marking was also used to revalidate a worn coin or as a sign of largess to soldiers.8 Ninety-six percent of the copper coins lost by Varus's legionaries at the battle site of the Teutoburger Wald have countermarks, many of which are on or next to the head of Augustus. Such countermarking probably indicated a donative, or money gift (donati vum, congiarium), to the troops on a special occasion.9 A chiseled-off numismatic por trait, however, clearly signals a memoria dam nata, although intentional damage of this sort was an ineffective form of damnation because of the great number of coins is sued. A recall would have been impractical because of the constant demand for coinage in everyday life. As for the destruction of portrait images set up in public, we know that under Caracalla, Baebius Iucinus, the prefect of Egypt, carried out the order for Geta's damnation (pp. 168, 183). In Rome, after a decree was formally issued by the Senate, it would presumably have fallen to the aediles, who were in charge of the gen eral care of the city (cura urbis), to oversee the destruction or removal of statues, in cluding the cleanup of damaged and smashed images. Throughout his book Varner explains</page><page sequence="3">592 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 what happened to a number of images of the condemned that were removed from public view but not mutilated or destroyed. Many of these were intentionally hidden away or warehoused for future use, some times immediately after the fall of the indi vidual and sometimes many years later. Cer tain unrecut or unreworked portraits survived because they were forgotten until their discovery in modern times. For this reason it is important to know the findspot of a portrait, information that Varner pro vides when it is known. As he notes, in the Roman period many sculptural portrait heads were separately carved in good-quality marble and inserted into statue bodies, of ten in a lesser-quality marble or stone.10 This workshop practice made it relatively easy to remove the head of one individual and replace it with another. However, such substitution, especially if the individual por trayed had not been condemned, was not without its risks, as we know in the case of Granius Marcellus, praetor of Bithynia, who was accused of treason at the outset of Tibe rius's principate for doing just that. As re corded in the Annales (1.74) of the Roman historian Tacitus, a charge was brought against Marcellus for removing the head of the deified Augustus from a statue body and replacing it with a head of Tiberius. This removal was probably somewhat analogous to changing the portrait of a president in an embassy after the election of a new presi dent. In any case, the charge was dropped by Tiberius. Marcellus's action was either misinterpreted or more likely misrepre sented by a subordinate intent on discredit ing him. Nevertheless, the mere fact that such a charge was brought against a promi nent Roman magistrate would have dis suaded others from doing likewise in the future. What has not been considered in the case of Granius Marcellus is whether Tacitus was correct about the head's having been "amputated [statua amputato capite].n Since the incident took place long before in far-off Bithynia, Tacitus would not have had direct knowledge of all the details. There fore, the portrait head of Augustus may have been shaped in the form of a tenon and simply removed from its mortise in the statue body, a less "violent" act than cutting it off a statue body. If, on the other hand, the head were secured (with or without ce ment) with a strong metal dowel in the tenon and mortise, it would probably have been cut off horizontally at the neck and then replaced with a new head that had a metal dowel inserted to secure it to the neck of the statue body.11 In late antiquity, various images were at tacked for religious reasons?a subject not addressed by Varner?or suffered damage or destruction as a result of barbarian inva sions. For example, we know that Christian fanatics in the late antique period willfully destroyed and mutilated all sorts of images, including earlier imperial portraits, whether or not they knew who was represented, be cause these images were thought to possess demons. Thus, a condemned person's por trait that escaped damage earlier may have been attacked later, in the Christian era, although we can rarely be certain of Chris tian culpability unless a sculpture was dese crated by having a cross or crosses carved into it.12 Barring such unambiguous signs, and unless ruled out by the context or cir cumstances, it is more likely that deface ment of a condemned person's portrait will have occurred shortly after his or her offi cial or unofficial damnation. A case in point (not in Varner's book) is an over-life-size bronze portrait statue of a woman discov ered in Sparta, now in the Athens National Museum, that was originally thought to have suffered mutilation at the hands of Chris tians.13 A more recent study, though, identi fied this statue as a portrait of Plautilla, who was exiled and executed by her husband Caracalla, resulting in her damnation and the destruction or defacement of her im ages.14 A portrait of Plautilla is more likely to have been attacked shortly after her death by followers of Caracalla than by Christians in a later era. If, conversely, an image of a person who was not condemned has come down to us intentionally defaced, it is quite possibly the handiwork of Chris tian zealots. A consideration of Caligula's images in chapter 2 (pp. 21-45) gives the reader a sense both of the range of issues and prob lems that will be found in the rest of the book and of Varner's approach to them. An important work that unfortunately did not appear in time for inclusion in his study is Dietrich Boschung's Gens Augusta: Untersu chungen zu Aufstellung, Wirkung und Bedeu tung der Statuengruppen des julisch-claudischen Kaiserhauses (2002), which deals with the portraiture of Caligula and other members of the Julian and Julio-Claudian families. As Varner himself notes (p. 44), "Caligula's de facto damnatio memoriae effectively established appropriate paradigms for the destruction and alteration of the visual representations of the condemned emperors which would endure for the next three centuries of the empire." Caligula, of course, was not the first Roman to have his images removed or destroyed.15 In the late Republic, for exam ple, a marble portrait of Marc Antony in the J. Paul Getty Museum (not in Varner) ap pears to have been re?ut into an image of the deified Julius Caesar,16 and portraits of Augustus's daughter Julia (Maior), who was exiled by her father, were undoubtedly re moved from public view (pp. 86-88). We know from the inscriptional evidence that Julia had been honored throughout the em pire with various images, though only one portrait of her is known to have survived? the front part of a head from Corinth that has rarely been published.17 By contrast, several portraits of Augustus's sister Octavia, whose image was as popular as that of Julia, have been identified.18 Many of Julia's por traits must have been removed from public display out of deference to her father, whom she disgraced (Varner, pp. 86-88). How these works were then treated is un known, but none of them seems to have been re?ut into another's image, at least as far as can be determined. At the outset of chapter 2, Varner briefly discusses the historical record for Caligula and his de facto damnation, rightly dismiss ing much of the nonsense that has been written about Caligula's supposed insanity.19 It is said that he suffered an "unofficial damnation" because his successor, Claudius, for political reasons did not allow the Sen ate to condemn Caligula officially just after his death in 41. Two years later, the Senate formally?apparently without Claudius's op position this time?ordered that "senatorial coinage" bearing Caligula's image (that is, S.C. bronze coins nominally under the con trol of the Senate) be recalled and melted down (Cassius Dio 60.22.3). No similar or der was issued by Claudius recalling "impe rial coinage" (that is, gold and silver state coinage) bearing Caligula's image. Despite the Senate's efforts, a number of S.C. sena torial coins with Caligula's image have come down to us, although some of these have been defaced or have the C (for Caius, or Gaius) of his praenomen obliterated in the coin's titulature (p. 24). Concerning a group of imperial portraits that were set up in the public theater at Caere (Cerveteri), now in the Museo Grego riano Profano in the Vatican, Varner asserts (p. 32) that the colossal head of Caligula, which was later re?ut into an image of the deified Augustus (fig. 18a-b), "attests to [Caligula's] innovations in portraiture pol icy through dissemination of his own like nesses in divine guise." However, since the head alone survives, there is no proof that Caligula had in fact been represented like a god. Even had he been so portrayed, the statues in the theater were set up not by him but by the municipality or a prominent private citizen of the town,20 and so do not reflect Caligula's official policy. Similarly, during the lifetime of Augustus, godlike im ages were set up to Augustus, but not by him.21 Tellingly, official inscriptions and imperial state coinage issued on the author ity of Caligula are free of any of the trap pings or claims of divinity that the hostile literary tradition attributes to him. Of the more than forty-eight sculptural and glyptic portraits of Caligula to have been discovered thus far, Varner concludes (p. 25) that "well over half of Caligula's marble portraits have been altered into other likenesses." When portraits of Rome's principes were reworked, they were typically transformed into images of other principes, be they immediate or later successors or</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS: POLLINI ON VARNER 593 1 Portrait bust of Caligula, 37-41 CE. Private collection, France (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Photo G. Dagli Orti, Paris) predecessors, especially those who had been deified. It is highly unlikely that a portrait of a princeps?condemned or not?would have been re?ut into an image of a private individual. Caligula's portraits, for example, were transformed into images of Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius, Titus, Claudius Gothi cus,22 and even, according to Varner, a god (the sun god Sol). He states (p. 34) that this last sculpture, a colossal head from Iol Caesarea (Cherchel), in the archaeological museum in Algiers,23 is "the only surviving likeness of a condemned emperor which seems clearly to have been transformed into the image of a deity (cat. 1.38)." It is by no means clear, however, that it was originally a portrait of Caligula, since the traces of hair locks at the back of the head indicate only some Julio-Claudian male. As noted above, some portraits were recycled years later, when the personage originally represented was no longer important in the dynastic ide ology of Rome's new leadership. Varner notes (pp. 36-37) that numerous sculptural portraits of Caligula, although removed and warehoused for later recutting or reworking, were never used. We know of a number of well-preserved portraits in the form of small bronze busts,24 to the list of which may now be added an unpublished bust of Caligula in a private French collec tion (reproduced here as Figs. 1, 2).25 Many fewer small busts in gold or silver survived, even if they represented principes who were deified or at least not damned, because of the intrinsic worth of the metals. The fact that almost half of Caligula's extant small bronze portraits came from the Tiber River strongly suggests that they were thrown into the river (as were criminals who perished in 2 Profile view of Fig. 1 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Photo G. Dagli Orti, Paris) the Colosseum) as a sign of dishonor and, at the same time, as a way of disinfecting them, since water was considered a purify ing agent. If small portraits of Caligula es caped the melting pots or were not muti lated or thrown into cisterns, wells, rivers, or harbors, then they may very well have come from a domestic setting. Their owners may have continued to keep them in their homes as a sign of loyalty or affection for Caligula, or they may have put them away for safekeeping, should the political winds shift. The same may be said for small gem stones and cameos (such as figs. 37, 38),26 which rarely reveal the mutilation of facial features,27 not only because of their small size but also because their material was not recyclable. In an exceptional example, Cal igula's image was recarved into that of Clau dius in a large chalcedony cameo (5% inches, or 14.5 centimeters long, carved to a depth of about an inch, or 2.5 centimeters), now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (p. 27, cat. no. 1.33, fig. 8a-b). Be cause of the high value of this cameo and its large size, its owner may have wanted to display it openly rather than hide it away, for which reason it made sense to refashion its imagery. Large gemstones or cameos also lend themselves more easily to recurring than small ones. Some of the sculptural portraits that Var ner describes as re?ut from images of Ca ligula, as well as of other individuals, strike me as dubious examples of reworking. In more debatable cases, Varner should per haps have been less definitive, since an im portant book of this sort will be consulted by nonspecialists who are not in a position to make their own judgments about whether or not something has been re worked. Among the questionable examples are two portraits of Augustus that Varner takes as re?ut from images of Caligula. The first is from the Palazzo dei Conservatori, presently in Centrale Montemartini (p. 31, cat. no. 1.11, fig. 17a-b). Stylistically, it is perhaps more likely that this head was pro duced as an Augustus in the Caligulan pe riod. I do not agree with Varner that the parting of the hair over the inner corner of the left eye derives from a previous portrait of Caligula. This hairstyle is entirely consis tent with Augustus's fifth portrait type ("Prima Porta" type), the type to which the Conservatori head belongs.28 Moreover, I do not see (as Varner claims) an unnatural sloping of the forehead and recutting of the locks over the forehead and behind the lower part of the left ear. The distinctive forking of locks behind the left ear is char acteristic of a number of replicas of Augus tus's Type V, while some of the better-qual ity portraits of Caligula show a pincer in this area. The second portrait of Augustus that does not seem to me to have been reworked from one of Caligula is in the Mus?e du Bardo in Tunis (p. 33, cat. no. 1.14, fig. 22a-c). In this instance, the entire back of the head appears to have been left roughly carved, with no trace of hair locks, however summarily rendered. It is also shaped in a way that further suggests that a separately carved veil was added to represent Augustus capite velatus.29 The treatment of the back of the head resembles that of two unrecut im ages from the theater of Taranto, now in the National Archaeological Museum in Copenhagen: a portrait of Germanicus (inv. no. VIII. 305) and another probably of Dru sus Minor or Nero Iulius (inv. no. VIII. 303).30 In these examples a separately carved veil appears to have been added to the head, or a veil may have been part of the draped statue body into which the head was inserted.31 The back of the head of the Taranto Germanicus has a large hole into which a metal dowel was probably inserted to stabilize the added marble veil. More of the locks are carved on either side of this head than in the case of the other portrait from Taranto. The degree of carving of the locks and the large hole at the back of the head of Germanicus find parallels in a por trait of Caligula from Aenona, now in the Museo C?vico in Trieste,32 which appears to have been cut down in modern times from a full-length togate statue. One unavoidable dilemma in a book that deals with any aspect of Roman portraiture is the difficulty in identifying specific histori cal individuals. There can be considerable scholarly debate on this matter even when members of the same family are shown to gether, as on the famous Grand Cam?e de France in the Biblioth?que Nationale de France in Paris (pp. 75-76, 94) ,33 Particu larly troublesome is the identification of cer</page><page sequence="5">594 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 tain members of the Julian and Julio-Clau dian families, as well as various principes and their families in the mid-third century (that is, ca. 235-84), when a number of leaders were overthrown in rapid succession. Indi viduals who suffered official or unofficial damnation but were in power for only a short time present even more problems, as in the case of Aemilian (p. 209), who was princeps for only a few months in 253 before both he and his wife Gaia Cornelia Supera were condemned. Since few sculptural images survive with their inscriptions, we depend to a very large extent on labeled coins in identifying sculp tural portraits of individuals. But coinage poses its own limitations, as it usually offers only a profile image, which often makes comparisons challenging. Nevertheless, for many of the principes of the third century, the only surely identifiable images are those on coins. An exception is the image of Bal binus on his sarcophagus?in fact, the only reliably identifiable surviving sarcophagus of a Roman princeps. Although Balbinus's body was mutilated and left exposed,34 the fig ures of him and his wife on his sarcophagus were not attacked (p. 204). Unfortunately, even coinage ceases to be of much help in identifying portraits of the later third and the fourth century, because, with the grow ing preference for more abstract forms as the concept of leadership changed, numis matic images of the principes become virtu ally indistinguishable from one another. Varner tracks changing attitudes and trends in the practice of mutilating, rework ing, and recycling portraits of the con demned. He believes that the recutting of images from one personage to another less ens over the period from Caligula to Domi tian and that in the second century imperial portraits were not immediately reworked after the damnation of an individual. Ex cept for the recutting of Elagabalus's por traits into images of Severus Alexander, there is in fact little evidence for the imme diate reworking of the image of one princeps into that of another in the third century. This practice reverts at the time of Constan tine in the early fourth century, when im ages were again reworked just after the con demnation of an imperial personage. In those periods in which portraits were not immediately refashioned, we find ample evi dence for the destruction, mutilation, and desecration of images. The reasons for these shifts are not always clear, although one fac tor might have been the ease or difficulty of reworking a particular individual's images. For example, Nero's rather full and fleshy face afforded a sculptor more latitude in recarving facial features, which might ac count for the recycling of more of Nero's portraits than of any other Roman princeps (p. 85). Conversely, certain types of hair styles and/or beards may have been more difficult to re?ut, thus explaining the lack of reworking (but not of defacing) in certain periods. Some female coiffures resembled each other closely enough to allow for re fashioning, as in a portrait of Agrippina Mi nor that was re?ut from an image of the condemned Messalina (p. 97, fig. 101a-d) or portrait statues of Constan tine's mother, Helena, that were re?ut from images of Commodus's damned sister Lucilla (p. 150, figs. 150a-b, 151a-b). Portraits of Elagaba lus may have been reworked into images of his cousin Severus Alexander just after Ela gabalus's overthrow?unlike what we find before and after this period?because both shared some familial physiognomic features, were of approximately the same age, and had similar hairstyles (p. 190). Statistics on the number of refashioned images may be somewhat deceptive. For ex ample, Varner puts the number of reworked images of Caligula at forty-three, of Nero at fifty-three, and of Domitian at twenty-four. Even if he is correct in all these cases, with out knowing how many portraits of each princeps were originally produced, we cannot know the percentage of surviving images or of those that were completely destroyed, re?ut, reworked, or transformed in some other way. Another factor that has to be considered is the number of portraits rela tive to the length of a given principate (for example, four years for Caligula, fourteen for Nero, and fifteen for Domitian) and at what rate portraits were produced over a particular principate. The fact that Nerva's principate lasted only two years and that almost all of his surviving images were re fashioned from portraits of Domitian sug gests that most recutting would have taken place at the beginning of a principate, when there was logically an immediate need for images of the new leader (p. 135).35 Most of the reworked portraits that have come down to us are in marble, but not in extremely hard stones like basalt and por phyry, which?with only one exception known to Varner (p. 123, cat. no. 5.26, fig. 127a-d)36?were not re?ut because of the difficulty in carving these hard stones. Metal images that were not simply melted down might be refashioned by replacing either the entire head at the level of the neck or the face only (that is, a masklike section). An excellent example of the latter is the bronze equestrian statue from Misenum, now in the Museo di Castello di Baia, in which Domitian's face was cut out and that of Nerva grafted on (pp. 120-22, fig. 123a b), a relatively simple and practical form of ancient "face-lift." By comparison, it must have been a daunting task to replace the head or face of the great 120-foot-high bronze colossus of Nero that once stood in the vestibule of Nero's Domus Aurea (pp. 66-67, 216, 219). On the opposite end of the spectrum as far as size is concerned, gemstones and cameos were rarely altered from the portrait of one individual into that of another because of the complexity of working on a very small scale. The issue of the reworking of images pro vokes much disagreement among scholars. As noted above, not all of the portraits that Varner takes as re?ut or otherwise reworked seem to me to have been refashioned. Since it is not feasible to give a personal analysis of each of the more problematic portraits that he discusses, I shall mention here only some of the difficulties involved in assessing whether or not an image has been re worked. In certain cases, the alterations of a portrait are unmistakable; in others, they are far more debatable, especially when judgment is based on photographs alone. The task is doubly complicated when there are no views of the back of the head, where telltale signs of recutting, reworking, or just summary or incomplete carving of details are commonly found. Although I am famil iar with a number of the images presented by Varner, I would have to reexamine some of these and other portraits in person with a fresh eye in order to offer a fair assessment of his observations. There are instances where we cannot be sure of reworking be cause of the lack of a context or literary documentation to suggest the possibility of alteration. The first portrait that Varner rep resents (p. 16, fig. 1), a work that he consid ers a portrait of Ptolemy IX re?ut from an image of Ptolemy X after Ptolemy IX re turned to power, illustrates several of these problems. Not addressed by Varner is the important question of whether this head might have been attacked sometime after it was re?ut. There is damage to both eyes, the nose, and part of the mouth, the very parts of a person's physiognomy that were most targeted by zealots. It is especially curious that both eyes and parts of the eyelids are seriously damaged, although there is no cor responding significant damage around these areas. Being further forward in the frontal plane, the eyebrows, in particular, would have been damaged if the portrait had suf fered an accidental injury. Deliberate assault therefore seems to be a real possibility, per haps by followers of Ptolemy X or by Chris tians, who were actively mutilating or de stroying images in the late antique period in Egypt. Of particular interest are several images of Caligula that managed to escape such attack. An Egyptian-style relief from Den dera, representing Caligula in pharaonic dress, survives unmutilated in situ (pp. 5-6, 40). Varner rightly observes that the survival of two sculptural images of Caligula from the agora of Gortyn (Crete) indicates the likelihood that others similarly were not de stroyed or removed after his assassination but continued to be displayed.37 One of the Gortyn portraits, a head cut for insertion into a statue body, is totally undamaged; the other, a togate statue, has sustained minor damage to the nose and small sections of</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS: POLLINI ON VARNER 595 the toga, such as occurs accidentally. The two portraits from Gortyn were very likely part of a dynastic group of images, but they alone (contrary to Varner's view, p. 43) could, of course, have been removed from their respective statue cycles. Although Ca ligula was maligned by biased Roman aristo cratic and Jewish writers, his name survives unmutilated in inscriptions found through out the empire. The same appears to be true for Domitian; Varner's report (p. 132) that 40 percent of the 400 surviving texts and inscriptions from the Domitianic period show signs of Domitian's name having been erased after his damnation signifies, of course, that 60 percent were not erased. Moreover, I doubt that we can automatically conclude, as does Varner (p. 41), that the "rather sparse evidence for epigraphic era sure further underscores the fact that Ca ligula's portraits were the primary targets of the damnation In any case, physical and ar chaeological evidence can be used to bal ance an otherwise extremely hostile ancient literary tradition that gives the impression that officially and unofficially damned indi viduals were universally detested. In Varner's opinion, the majority of unde faced portraits of the condemned had been set aside for later recutting or reworking. It seems to me, however, that such a conclu sion is generally merited only when images were being stored in a sculptor's workshop. Unfortunately, we usually lack this sort of archaeological context or any information about the circumstances under which things came to be removed from public view. Cer tain works would have been intentionally hidden by supporters to preserve them from destruction. Some of Rome's condemned principes were popular among the Roman lower classes both before and after their death.38 After Nero's suicide, for example, the phenomenon of pseudo-Neros popping up in the East reminds us of Elvis sightings in our own day. In short, we should not as sume that there was any sort of empire-wide systematic destruction or removal of images and inscribed names of Roman leaders and members of their family who were officially or unofficially condemned in Rome. In vari ous parts of the empire, everyday life con tinued with little notice or concern for the political situation in far-off Rome. What mattered most to the inhabitants of the em pire was that there was peace and stability, enabling them to conduct their affairs ac cording to their traditions. The imperial Roman system of government guaranteed these benefactions to those who behaved in a civilized manner, with the negative effects of the idiosyncrasies and tyrannical behavior of certain leaders by and large confined to the city of Rome. Varner notes (p. 11) that "the wide range and variation of coiffure and physiognomy among re?ut images . . . underscore the in nate diversity present in the portraiture of any given emperor." For a number of princi pes there is, in fact, debate about how many portrait prototypes were commissioned dur ing their lifetimes, the evidence based on surviving sculptural replicas reflecting lost models. For example, it was long believed that only three official portrait types of Au gustus existed, but more recent studies now suggest five, with subtypes.39 In addition, the chronological order in which prototypes were created may be in dispute.40 In identi fying siblings in extant images, it may even be difficult to distinguish which portrait type represents which individual at a given age because of physical or even fictive simili tude, as in the case of two designated suc cessors, who, as principes iuventutis, were typi cally likened to the Castores/Dioskouroi in imperial ideology. Geta and Caracalla, for example, can be easily differentiated in their first boyhood portrait types ("Thron folgertypus I"), but it is very difficult to tell them apart in their second portrait types ("Thronfolgertypus II"). However, circum stantial evidence for distinguishing between the two brothers in their second portrait types is provided by the damnation of Geta by Caracalla after the death of their father, Septimius Severus, in 211, resulting in the survival of relatively few images of Geta.41 For those who are not portrait specialists, it is important in considering refashioned im ages to be aware of the sorts of problems inherent in studying ancient portraiture and the lack of agreement among scholars on a number of issues. Varner does not consis tently point out such debate. A great deal of the variation seen in por trait features can be attributed to the differ ent abilities and interests of individual carv ers and their workshop traditions. For example, a head of Augustus in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (inv. no. 746; fig. 21a-d) does not particularly look like him, at least based on the best extant replicas of his principal official portrait types, but its iconographie hairstyle may situate it as a subtype of his fourth type.42 A lack of re semblance alone is therefore not sufficient reason to conclude that a portrait has been reworked, even though a great number of re?ut images of Rome's condemned principes and members of their family show some compromise in the way that facial features and hairstyles are rendered. Reworking must still always be considered a possibility in such cases, especially since it may help answer questions about the authenticity of some works that in the past have been dis missed as fakes because of oddly rendered features. In some rare?and more compli cated?cases, a portrait may even have un dergone recutting at two different times, thus reflecting the features of three individ uals instead of the usual two. One such ex ample is a cuirassed portrait statue of Nero in the Museo Nazionale d'Antichit? in Parma that was first re?ut into a likeness of Domitian, only to be reworked after Domi tian's assassination and official damnation into an image of Nerva (p. 117, fig. 161a e). Given the compromises in facial features that often result from recutting, Varner might profitably have addressed the ques tion of whether or not Romans were pri marily interested in reproducing an individ ual's actual facial characteristics fairly accurately, even if in a somewhat ennobled form. To be sure, some Romans considered such similitude very important;43 others, apparently, did not. A number of Republi can grave monuments, for example, show rather stereotypical "veristic" images that have more to do with workshop traditions and production than the actual portrait fea tures of the deceased.44 Moreover, the ma jority of provincials living far from Rome probably would not have cared about accu racy in the representation of the princeps' portrait features. For those who were inter ested in knowing who was portrayed,45 most images bore an identifying inscription, about which even the illiterate could in quire. In an extreme case of renaming, a statue of Orestes?undoubtedly an ideal type?that stood before the entrance to the Heraion in Mycenae was identified as Au gustus by the inscription on its base.46 Clearly, economics often outweighed the need for exactitude in portrait features and/or hairstyle. Of course, the princeps himself would not usually have commis sioned re?ut portraits since he had no need to save money in this way and since marble quarries, which were generally under his control, would have provided ample "fresh" material for his images.47 Another complicating factor that Varner neglects is the matter of Zeitgesicht (tempo ral visage), that is, the representation of a private individual as resembling an impor tant contemporary personage in facial fea tures and/or hairstyle. At one time, for ex ample, a head of Vespasian in the Cleveland Museum of Art (p. 53, cat. no. 2.17, fig. 49a-e) was dismissed as one of his portraits, largely because of its lack of conformity to one of his known iconographie hairstyles, and was taken instead as an example of Zeit gesicht.48 Subsequently, a careful "autopsy" of the Cleveland head showed that this im age had been re?ut from one belonging to Nero's last portrait type.49 When reworking is not so clear, consideration should always be given to whether or not a portrait might be an example of Zeitgesicht rather than of alteration from the image of another. In conclusion: it is frequently difficult to know why or when certain portraits were mutilated, altered so as to leave no physical trace of the former image, removed to be buried, recarved into the image of a succes sor or even a deified predecessor, or left standing, sometimes as part of an imperial statuary cycle. The types and costs of materi</page><page sequence="7">596 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 als used in making images, as well as their size and the contexts in which they were displayed, could all play an important role in determining the fate of a particular por trait. Varner's exploration of these issues in this thought-provoking book constitutes a significant contribution to the study of Ro man portraiture and iconoclasm, with spe cial reference to the power of images and the kinds of responses they elicited in Ro man society. These are matters that have implications for broader questions about the important role of portraiture in human history.
