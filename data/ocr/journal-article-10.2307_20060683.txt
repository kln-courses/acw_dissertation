In 1270 the city of Cologne gave Bishop Heinrich III von Neuch?tel of Basel the head of St. Pantalus?the legendary first bishop of Basel, martyred in the company of the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne. Shortly after its translation to Basel, the bishop had this precious relic enshrined within a splendid new gilded silver reliquary bust. The devotional and political significance of the reliquary, which provided both a tangible focus for the veneration of the local saint and a visual assertion of the sanctity of episcopal authority in Basel, underscores the central role played by relics and their containers in the fashioning of identity and meaning in the Middle Ages. Reliquaries and liturgical appurtenances pro vided visual foci?fleshing out collectively held truths of faith, social and hierarchical re lationships, and institutional and civic identity. As the repository of these items, the cathe dral treasury was a nexus of meaning in the medieval urban environment, as its manifold objects were stored, displayed, and processed throughout the liturgical year. Unfortunately, few treasuries have survived in anything other than a fragmentary state (ironically so in the case of reliquaries, many of which were designed to flesh out the form and meanings of the fragments they enshrined). Often we have only cursory references to help us piece together these treasuries. Inventories tell us about the splendid contents of many church treasuries, but few such collections can be reconstructed today. The task of reassembling church treasuries is of the greatest significance not only for augmenting our understanding of the arts of medieval Europe but also for helping us realize the dynamics of social, institutional, and devotional interactions that were thereby channeled. We might note a certain parallel between the reconstitution of the treasury and the way in which its reliquaries reconstituted the saints. The earliest surviving inventory of the treasury of Basel cathedral, made in 1477, lists the reliquary bust of St. Pantalus among its plethora of sacred items. We are fortunate that the majority of objects listed in this, and subsequent, inven tories have survived (including the St. Pantalus bust), thereby enabling the reconstitution</page><page sequence="2">526 Reviews of this important cathedral treasury. In the acknowledgments to the English catalogue of the exhibition of the treasury of Basel cathedral, held in 2001 in New York, Basel, and Munich (p. xi), Timothy Husband notes that so much medieval art history is forced to focus upon membra disjecta?artwork that has been removed from its context. This ex hibition and these volumes provide a felicitous exception to that rule. The exhibition provided an extraordinary and all-too-rare chance to examine the mag nitude, scope, and splendor of objects contained in such ecclesiastical collections. The trea sury of Basel cathedral is among the most important of medieval treasuries, partly because of the high rate of survival but also because of the splendid quality of the objects themselves. Thus the reassembling of the treasury (in actuality for the exhibition and in publication for the catalogues) constitutes a significant scholarly contribution and is worthy of the highest praise. The two catalogue volumes do an admirable job in both illustrating the exquisite quality of these splendid objects and in situating them within the historical, cultic, and institutional contexts in which they were created and used. They present an impressive array of items spanning five centuries, from the founding of the new cathedral by Henry II in 1019 to the outbreak of iconoclastic Reformation zeal in 1529. They provide a window into the sumptuous, dazzling display of sacral objects that provided liturgical focus and expressed the power and presence of the saints in their relics and the role of the church in guarding them. The two catalogues are not interchangeable but rather complementary in intention. A note in the English edition (p. xiv) states: "This volume is not intended as an exhaustive catalogue of the Basel Cathedral Treasury?for that is being produced by the Historisches Museum Basel?but rather as a concise, informative overview with appeal for all readers. In matters of date and attribution we have relied on the scholarship of the Basel catalogue authors, and the resultant consistency in the heading material will allow, it is hoped, the two publications to complement each other." Clearly the principal scholarly thrust of the project is contained in the impressive German edition, which includes more exhaustive articles, catalogue entries, and bibliography, while the English version provides a more general overview directed at a broader audience. The volumes are successful in achieving their respective goals. Scholarly rigor is maintained without sacrificing clarity and acces sibility. Each volume is divided into two sections?a series of essays and the catalogue proper. The catalogue itself is extensive (sixty-one entries in the German volume, some consisting of several similar or related objects; fifty-seven entries in the English volume)?including not only large items, such as figurai reliquaries and monstrances, but also small objects which are often overlooked, including reliquary capsules and mass bells. Another impres sive aspect of the catalogue is the discussion of copies and lost items (such as the chapel reliquary of circa 1330, lost in Berlin in May 1945), thereby making the catalogue truly exhaustive in its attempt to reconstruct the entire cathedral treasury. Both catalogues are well organized, arranging the objects thematically by form and function. The catalogue entries in the German volume are substantial, being particularly extensive in terms of prov enance, dating, stylistic comparisons, and description. These catalogue entries are not as concerned with issues of use and meaning?something that I find a bit surprising in a catalogue on a major cathedral treasury. While such issues are addressed in the essays later in the volume, it might have been helpful to provide a brief introductory overview of the function of each object type as grouped in the catalogues. The listing of the inventory records of each item as part of the catalogue entry is an excellent idea that supports the entire edifice of scholarship around reconstructing the treasury by referencing the sources of much of that knowledge. It might have been useful to include the actual inventory lists (at least for the 1477, 1511, and 1525 inventories?the three most extensive and most often cited, prior to the nineteenth-century inventories). In the slimmer English volume,</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 527 some of the entries are superb, incorporating aspects of the objects' use as well as scholarly debate over such issues as provenance, as in the case of the altar frontal (cat. 2-3). Many of the entries are good but brief, leaving the reader wishing that some of these discussions were more expansive, particularly in regard to the use and iconography of the items. Per haps, however, it is a positive sign that the biggest potential complaint about the English catalogue is that one is left wanting more of it. For those thus enticed, the German volume provides the more complete entries. Both catalogues provide ample and exquisite images of the objects?a nice array of full views and fine details, as well as useful comparative material. This is an impressive and complete pair of catalogues. The English volume begins with four brief historical essays by Timothy Husband and Julien Chapuis. The first two essays succeed in providing a lucid historical overview of the city and its cathedral. The third essay, outlining the history of the treasury, seeks to intro duce the use and political significance of the cult objects. This is a tall order, but Chapuis succeeds in providing a clear overview that is supported by specific examples, such as the use of the true cross reliquary and relic in the Good Friday liturgy and the lavish augmen tation of the treasury at the time when episcopal power was waning. The discussion of storage and display of the treasury objects is also welcome. Particularly felicitous is the discussion of processional display of relics and reliquaries, which helps to explain the spatial-temporal performative nature of display (Chapuis details the arrangements for the Corpus Christi celebration). This attention to the use of cult objects is welcome, as it fleshes out the meaning of the objects in the exhibition, directing the reader to view the pieces as components of a complex liturgical/cultic/political nexus, rather than simply as splendid examples of medieval metalwork. Husband's essay on the dispersal of the treasury helps to underscore the importance of the exhibition that reassembled this treasury. It also ad dresses the way in which the treasury should be viewed as an entity?albeit a changing one. It is not merely a collection of individual objects but an assemblage that encapsulates an image of ecclesiastical, and civic, identity for Basel. These essays, largely based on the exemplary scholarship contained in the German volume, provide an excellent introduction to the catalogue that follows and thus fulfill the stated intention of the English volume to provide a broad overview for a wider audience. Not surprising, given its more scholarly intention, the German volume is more exhaustive and current in its references and bibliography, incorporating recent contributions. It begins with the extensive catalogue itself, followed by the equally substantive Aufs?tze, nineteen essays composed by important scholars in the field. Some of the essays are more specific, while others provide a general overview of the contexts in which the treasury objects should be seen. They are divided into four thematic groupings, the first of which addresses symbols of authority ("Herrschaftszeichen"). Five essays provide useful background on historical and political aspects of the diocese and the city and the role of the cathedral treasury in providing symbols for their standing. As Achatz von M?ller notes, "The treasury of Basel cathedral was born of politics" (p. 218). Jean-Claude Rebetez and Peter Habicht provide the historical and political background that helps contextualize the treasury. Achatz von M?ller and Lucas Burkart discuss the way(s) in which reliquaries create visual foci not only for devotion but also for power and authority. Valentin Groebner discusses issues of the value of materials and donations. This section adds an important historical dimension to the catalogue by providing a wealth of information that allows the treasury to be seen and understood within the political context in which it was situated. The second group, of six essays, discusses the cathedral and its treasury ("Das M?nster und sein Schatz"), examining specific aspects, meanings, types, and techniques of objects in the treasury. Hans-Rudolf Meier examines the location and storage of the treasury in the sacristies, providing a useful background on the details and environment of storage of cathedral treasuries. Johann Michael Fritz then discusses treasuries in general, helping to</page><page sequence="4">528 Reviews contextualize the Basel treasury within the broader spectrum of ecclesiastical treasuries. Fritz also surveys the publication history of various important medieval treasuries, situating this catalogue within this scholarly context. In discussing the magnitude of other treasuries and the dispersion of many of them, Fritz sheds light on the significance of the survival of the Basel treasury and the publication of this catalogue. Barbara Boehm investigates a particular "species" of reliquary?the anthropomorphic, or body-part, type. She provides a background history on the development of various types of anthropomorphic reliquaries and also discusses the significance of the saints and their reliquaries in Basel. Sabine H?berli and Regine Fellmann Brogli analyze the gemstones inserted into the various objects and their meanings. Benno Schubiger examines the group of five tower monstrances in the treasury and their relationship to major goldsmith workshops in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Martin Sauter assesses the techniques of goldsmith work utilized in the creation of the pieces in the treasury. The third section is essentially a continuation of the second group, in that it contains essays by Gude Suckale-Redlefsen and Wolfgang Corjaens on the important high altar and its eleventh-century antependium, donated by Emperor Henry II. This work alone would make the treasury significant, in that it is one of the few surviving altar frontals of the early Middle Ages (the other two are the ninth-century frontal in S. Ambrogio, Milan, and the eleventh-century frontal in Aachen cathedral). The fourth section ("Heiltum und Kult") contains six essays examining the role of relics and liturgical practice in Basel. Romain Jurot provides a summary survey of liturgical manuscripts from Basel, while Franz Egger's brief essay discusses the liturgical uses of oil. Katharina Eder Matt and Dominik Wunderlin's essay describes the cult of saints and relics and their role in medieval Basel. It first provides a general background to the cult of relics. This, like some of the other essays, serves more as a general, contextualizing introduction to the objects in the catalogue, but this essay also contains a useful discussion of the specifics of the relics, contained in altars as well as reliquaries, and their significance in Basel. This is nicely followed by Marie-Claire Berkemeier-Favre's analysis of relics and reliquaries in the religious life of medieval Basel. She describes the physical arrangement of the rood screen, altars, tabernacle, baptismal font, and pulpit?essentially the layout of the liturgical and devotional context of the cathedral. A discussion of the arrangement and display of major objects on the high altar during the major feast days of the year and the processions involving reliquaries and monstrances reveals the performative dynamics of display that animated the objects in the treasury. Gabriela Signori augments the discussion of the social context of the cathedral by examining the commemorative donations for the souls of the dead and funerary monuments and by surveying confraternities and other lay involvement. Lukas Schenker's essay closes the volume with a sketch of the history of the cathedral's relics, from the 1529 closing of the treasury/sacristy to the 1834 transfer of the relics to the Benedictine abbey of Mariastein, including the eventual creation of new reliquaries such as busts for the skulls of Pantalus and Ursula. This is an interesting place to end the catalogue?returning to the most important aspect of the treasury, the relics themselves, the very raison d'?tre for most of the objects in the catalogue. It seems appropriate that the final image in the catalogue shows a relic procession in 1931, with the relics in their nine teenth-century reliquaries?prominent are the Pantalus and Ursula busts. Thus the life force of the treasury is revealed in its dynamic processional performance and brought into the twentieth century. While not all of the essays are intended to provide groundbreaking scholarship, they are all successful in presenting the state of knowledge in a clear and succinct manner. A great deal of scholarly information is presented here, providing a veritable treasure trove for further research. One is presented with a thorough and well-documented examination of the context, use, and meaning of the treasury in the religious, institutional, political, and civic life of a medieval city. This volume in particular gives a most impressive and complete</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 529 overview of the various roles of the cathedral and its treasury in the religious and daily life of medieval Basel. The editor, Brigitte M?les, has amassed a collection of essays that should prove to be one of the touchstones for future studies of medieval Basel as well as of eccle siastical treasuries in general. Both volumes are to be lauded for achieving their respective goals. The German catalogue provides an impressive array of scholarly information, guaranteeing itself an important place in the bibliography on medieval church treasuries. The English volume provides a succinct, though well-delivered, distillation of this material, making it available to an En glish-speaking audience. However, the primacy of the impressive German tome must be recognized for its important contributions to scholarship on medieval art and on church treasuries in particular. This builds upon the contributions of such exhibitions/catalogues as Ornamenta ecclesiae from Cologne in 1985. The Basel cathedral treasury catalogues continue this work, contributing greatly in gathering together the component pieces of a single treasury. This constitutes a significant contribution to medieval scholarship and pro vides a model that one can only hope will be emulated. It seems appropriate, therefore, to close this review of the two catalogues by referencing the two arm reliquaries?of St. Walpert and St. Valentine?that are portrayed in an attitude of benediction.
