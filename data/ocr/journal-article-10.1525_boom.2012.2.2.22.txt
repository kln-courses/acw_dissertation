Popping up during a panel focused on the Discovery Channel’s “Dinosaur Revolution”  series, Herzog pontificated in a Bavarian accent about how the four-day geekfest  represented an epic acting out of the public’s “collective dreams.” We all applauded  with delight as Herzog, known for his art films and documentaries, bubbled with  boyish enthusiasm about fandom’s ritual practices and shared beliefs as breathlessly  as he might have talked about going up the Amazon River to film Fitzcaraldo, or in  search of prehistoric art for his more recent Cave of Forgotten Dreams.  A few years ago, another documentary filmmaker, Morgan Spurlock, found  himself in conversation with comic book legend Stan Lee at one of Comic-Con’s  cocktail parties. The pair got excited about possibilities for documenting the  Boom: A Journal of California, Vol. 2, Number 2, pps 22–36.

If you have a single geeky bone in your body (and who  doesn’t these days?), you have probably heard about Comic- Con, which is held each year at the San Diego Convention  Center. Entertainment Weekly does an annual Comic-Con  cover story. The Los Angeles Times does a special insert.  And trade publications like The Hollywood Reporter also  provide extensive coverage. However, for the most part,  these reporters rarely get outside Hall H (where most of the  film-related programming is held) or Ballroom 20 (where  the high-profile television events take place).
