<plain_text><page sequence="1">XLIX PARALLELS TO IDEAS IN THE LETTRES PERSANES T HE Lettres Persanes, on which Montesquieu worked in leisurely fashion for perhaps ten years, reflect to a large extent the voluminous reading he must have done during this time. Their great variety of sub- jects implies numerous possible sources of inspiration, not all as yet indicated by Montesquieu scholars. It is my purpose to consider as pos- sible sources of some ideas in the Lettres Persanes three authors of Mon- tesquieu's epoch-Malebranche, Leibniz, and Shaftesbury. By the ex- pression "possible sources" I mean that there are between Montesquieu and these three writers some relationships of ideas which may imply influence, since Montesquieu esteemed these writers and knew, or could have known, their works before 1721, the date of the publication of the Lettres Persanes. Two of these authors, Malebranche and Shaftesbury, were in fact greatly admired by Montesquieu. Ranking them as highly as Plato and Montaigne, he even calls these four writers "the four great poets."l That Montesquieu was intimately acquainted with Malebranche long before the publication of the Lettres Persanes is certain. He must have studied the works of this philosopher, for it is known that in 1716 he read at the Academy of Bordeaux a dissertation on the system of Male- branche.2 It is not surprising, then, to find in the Lettres Persanes remi- niscences from this author. When Montesquieu maintains that in order to console a man's grief he must be treated as a sensitive being and not as a reasonable one, he does so most likely under the influence of the system of Malebranche. When he pokes fun at such narrow-minded persons as the geometrician, the lover of antiquity, and the pedant, he makes use of satirical details which very probably are also reminiscences from this author.3 But it is particularly in Letter 83, where Montesquieu gives his idea of justice, that the probable influence of Malebranche is most significant. Montesquieu's conception of justice is a synthesis of various concepts, the most important of which he seems to have derived from Malebranche and from Leibniz. Let us recall his famous definition of justice: La justice est un rapport de convenance, qui se trouve reellement entre deux choses; ce rapport est toujours le meme, quelque etre qui le considere, soit que ce soit Dieu, soit que ce soit un ange, ou enfin que ce soit un homme. 1 Pensees et fragments, II, 490. 2 Strowski, Montesquieu, p. 13. 8 Cf.

In this respect, as a French critic, Jacques Flach, has already pointed out,4 justice is analogous to Plato's ideas; it is an entity. However, the most significant and novel characteristic of justice, as conceived by Montesquieu, is its analogy to mathematical truths; it is, like these, always a relationship, the same in the eyes of all intelligent beings from God on down to man. This is the concept which Montes- quieu very probably owes to Malebranche who, speaking of mathemati- cal relationships, had said in his Traite de Morale: ... Ces rapports sont les memes verites eternelles que Dieu voit; car Dieu voit aussi bien que moi que 2 fois 2 font 4, et que les triangles qui ont meme base et qui sont entre memes paralleles sont egaux ... De la il est evident qu'il y a du vrai et dufaux, du juste et de l'injuste; et cela a l'egard de toutes les intelligences. Que ce qui est vrai a l'egard de l'homme est vrai a l'egard de l'ange et a l'egard de Dieu meme; que ce qui est injustice ou dereglement a l'egard de l'homme est aussi tel a l'egard de Dieu meme; car tous les esprits, contemplant la meme substance intelligible, y decouvrent necessairement les memes rapports de Grandeur ou les memes verites speculatives.5 But if the idea that justice is a relationship seems to have been sug- gested to Montesquieu by Malebranche, the particular expression rap- port de convenance with the concept which it implies is very likely from Leibniz. Although the phrase itself can be found in Malebranche's Recherche de la verite,6 it is not applied to justice (as is the case in the Theodicee of Leibniz, which Montesquieu must have known); for, as M. Carcassonne has pointed out,7 Letter 69 seems to re-echo some of its ideas. The German philosopher in defining punitive justice had said: Cette justice n'est fondee que dans la convenance, qui demande une certaine satisfaction pour l'expiation d'une mauvaise action ... Les Sociniens la croient /tre sans fondement; mais elle est toute fondee dans un rapport de convenance, qui contente non seulement l'offense, mais encore les sages qui la voient... 8 That Montesquieu arrived at his general conception of justice and laws by analogy from mathematical truths is evident, furthermore, from the following well-known passage of the Esprit des lois: Avant qu'il y eAt des lois faites, il y avoit des rapports de justice possibles. Dire qu'il n'y a rien de juste ni d'injuste que ce qu'ordonnent ou defendent les lois "Platon et Montesquieu," Revue Bleue, Jan. 2 and 9, 1909. 6 (luvres, I, 401 (1837 ed.). 6 Book In, Conclusion, p. 228 (1678 ed.). 7 Lettres Persanes, 11, 191. 8 (Euvres Philosophiques de Leibnitz, ed.

It is absolute because it is by nature forever a relationship, the same for all intelligent beings; it is relative because the things in which the relationship lies may and do vary from place to place and from one epoch to another, and, by varying, change the relationship which, when perceived and rec- ognized by the state, becomes a law. Let us now turn from Malebranche and Leibniz to Shaftesbury. Sev- eral ideas expressed by Montesquieu in the Lettres Persanes may be found in two of Shaftesbury's essays, the Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour and the Letter concerning Enthusiasm. This does not mean that Montesquieu was necessarily influenced by Shaftesbury. But consider- ing the fact that Montesquieu greatly admired this English writer, and that the two essays were translated into French many years before the publication of the Lettres Persanes, it is more than probable that the Frenchman was acquainted with them. Indeed, both were translated not once but twice-the Letter concerning Enthusiasm in 1708 and again in 1709, and the Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour twice in 1710.10 At any rate, in adopting and developing the Aristotelian idea that the origin of society lies in the natural ties of kinship, and at the same time rejecting scornfully all other theories on the subject, Montesquieu as- sumes exactly the same attitude as Shaftesbury. The question first arises in Letter 94. Montesquieu begins by stating that it seems ridiculous to him that the subject of international law cannot come up without a careful inquiry first being made into the origin of society. If, he con- tinues, men did not form any societies, if they avoided one another, it would be necessary to ask why they isolated themselves. But, he con- cludes, "ils naissent tous lies les uns aux autres; un fils est ne aupres de son pere, et il s'y tient: voila la Societe et la cause de la Societe." Mon- tesquieu comes back to this theory in Letter 104 where, it is significant to note, he attributes it to the English. According to them, reports Montesquieu, Ii n'y a qu'un lien qui puisse attacher les hommes, qui est celui de la gratitude; un mari, une femme, un pere et un fils ne sont lies entr'eux que par l'amour qu'ils se portent, ou par les bienfaits qu'ils se procurent, et ces motifs divers de reconnaissance sont l'origine de tous les royaumes et de toutes les societes. 9 Book i, ch. i. 10 Lettre sur l'enthousiasme . . trad. par Samson, 1708;-trad. de l'anglais (La Haye, 1709), in-18.

If there be anything of nature in that affection which is between the sexes, the affection is certainly as natural towards the consequent offspring; and so again between the offspring themselves, as kindred and companions, bred under the same discipline and economy. And thus a clan or tribe is.gradually formed; a public is recognized; . .. How the wit of man should so puzzle this cause as to make civil government and society appear a kind of invention and creature of art, I know not.ll Other relationships likewise between Montesquieu and Shaftesbury are to be noted in their conception of God. The Montesquieu of the Lettres Persanes is in this respect as great an optimist and as much a deist as Shaftesbury. Like the Englishman, he talks of a benevolent God, not of a malicious and tyrannical one; of a God entirely free from human imperfections, not of an anthropomorphic one burdened with human and, therefore, contradictory attributes. Thus we find Montesquieu be- ginning the letter on justice with the conditional statement-quite bold in the France of his epoch-that if there is a God, he must necessarily be just; for if he were not, he would be the most wicked and the most imperfect of all beings: "S'il y a un Dieu . . . il faut necessairement qu'il soit juste, car, s'il ne l'etoit pas, il seroit le plus mauvais et le plus im- parfait de tous les etres." Towards the end of the letter he expresses his anger at those theologians who would have God act d'une maniere dont nous ne voudrions pas agir nous-memes, de peur de l'offenser; qui le chargent de toutes les imperfections qu'il punit en nous, et, dans leurs opinions contradictoires, le representent tantot comme un etre mauvais, tantot comme un etre qui halt le mal et le punit. These ideas are essentially similar to those expressed by Shaftesbury in his Letter concerning Enthusiasm. He argues: If we are afraid, ... of thinking with freedom and pleasantness on such a sub- ject as God, 'tis because we conceive the subject so like ourselves, and can hardly have a notion of majesty and greatness without stateliness and moroseness accompanying it.12 Further on he declares that "the best security against all superstition" is "to remember that there is nothing in God but what is god-like; and that he is either not at all, or truly and perfectly good." "But," he continues, "when we are afraid to use our reason freely, ... we then actually presume him bad, and flatly contradict that pretended charac- 1 Characteristics, r, 74, ed. John M. Robertson (New York, 1900). 776 12 Op. Cit., I, 18.</page><page sequence="5">Alessandro S. Crisafulli ter of goodness and greatness.... "18 Finally Shaftesbury says in the same conditional manner as does Montesquieu several years later: ... If there really was a God, the highest goodness must of necessity belong to him, without any of those defects of passion, those meannesses and imperfec- tions which we acknowledge such in ourselves....14 There is still another similarity between the God of Montesquieu and that of Shaftesbury. After having defined justice as being always the same both in the eyes of God and of men, Montesquieu explains why it is that men may overlook it, while God never can. The reason is that God is self-sufficient, and that if he were unjust, he would be so without interest; therefore, it is impossible for him to be unjust. Mais il n'est pas possible que Dieu fasse jamais rien d'injuste; des qu'on suppose qu'il voit la Justice, il faut necessairement qu'il la suive, car, comme il n'a besoin de rien, et qu'il se suffit a lui-meme, il seroit le plus m6chant de tous les etres, puisqu'il le seroit sans interet. Similarly Shaftesbury had argued that God must be good, because he has no particular interest. He says: There is an odd way of reasoning, but in certain distempers of mind very sov- ereign to those who can apply it; and it is this: "There can be no malice but where interests are opposed. A universal being can have no interest opposite, and therefore can have no malice." If there be a general mind, it can have no particular interest: but the general good, or good of the whole, and its own pri- vate good, must of necessity be one and the same.l5 Such are the most important ideas which link Montesquieu with Male- branche, Leibniz, and Shaftesbury. In the case of the first two authors the relationships are of such a close and unusual nature that they strongly imply influence. In the case of Shaftesbury, although the analogies are striking, it would be imprudent to assume that he was necessarily the one who influenced Montesquieu. This is particularly true of the similarities dealing with the attributes of God, a subject frequently treated in the beginning of the XVIIIth century. Therefore, not until most of the theo- logical and metaphysical works then published have been carefully read, should Shaftesbury be considered Montesquieu's only source of inspira- tion in this subject.
