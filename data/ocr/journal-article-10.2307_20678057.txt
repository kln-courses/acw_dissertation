<plain_text><page sequence="1">L'animalite: Hommes et animaux dans la littgrature frangaise, Alain NIDERST, Ed. Tubingen, Gunter Narr Verlag, 1994, 240 p. This publication of the University of Rouen's Research Center for the History of Ideas and of Sensitivity represents a wide range of specializations, but the common purpose of its authors, philosophers, historians and ((litter aires , is to substantiate the relationship between human nature and animal nature and the import of texts that resort to animality to speak to us about humanity. In his crowded Nature humaine et nature animale, Claude Drevet blends philosophy and social sciences, from Plato and Montaigne to Lacan, and from Aristotle and Machiavelli to Levi-Strauss. According to Drevet, the dividing line is not between man and animals but between the soul and the body: ?Between the soul and the body, between the spiritual and the cor poreal we find is called animality, which is only corporeality assumed by different types of souls. Refuting Descartes, he adds that ((what we call Man is an animal, but a 'de-natured' animal because he transformed his</page><page sequence="2">COMPTES RENDUS 255 relationship with other types of animals into one of domination, organized his thoughts, adopted diverse living conditions and embarked upon an imperious civilizing course of action, in a principle of transformation that one may call the principle of perfectibility. Animality is a supplement of being and a comportment to which man can succumb, but it is above all a form of identification. Stressing that the cult of animals was so universally widespread in the past that many considered it more natural than the adoration of anthropo morphic gods, Drevet offers the explanation that men saw the instinctive function of the animal, immediate and sure, as a strength, and reflection, a source of indecision, as a human weakness. Guy Nondiers's Avatars du dragon d'Occident traces the evolution of this fantastic creature found on all continents from most ancient times. He traces to Mesopotamia the first image of the dragon as a horned snake poised on two embryonic front legs, representing Tiamat, the goddess who gave birth to the world and to the forces (good and bad) that must subdue the celestial gods. For centuries, the dragon remained a reptile in Greek and Latin texts, but it is in the Iliad that the word drakon appears for the first time. Dragons play a far more important role in early Norwegian and Icelandic tales that later became part of medieval German legends: while Nidhhoggr, the dragon from Hades daintily consumes the bodies of the dead, the dragon of the ocean occasionally fights Th6rr until the ultimate battle in which both oppo nents die. Nidhhoggr then flies over the ruins, and Nondier indicates that it is the first occurrence of a winged dragon, and of the use of the word dreki, borrowed from Greco-Latin. In Breton legend, the fire-spitting but not necessarily winged dragon sim ply remains an obstacle that the hero must conquer, but the Bible's Leviathan is a devious snake, dragon of the sea, and it is within the Christian tradition that the dragon loses its ambiguous nature and becomes a symbol of evil and the incarnation of Satan. Nondier provides interesting lexical information on new meanings for the word dragon in medieval warfare, and reminds us that it is the dragon's universal image that made it a part of the psychoanalytic repertoire. Jean Maurice studies the desired means to reach God in Signes animaux au XIIIe siecle dans les bestiaires moralises et dans le (&lt;Bestiaire encyclop dique de Brunetto Latini . Nature being the great reservoir of symbols, all its elements were catalogued in the ideal medieval library. The Physiologus, an immensely popular anonymous bestiary of the second century was soon translated, enriched by numerous addenda, and imitated. ((Moralized bes tiaries written in common languages used the real or fictitious characteristics of animals [real or fictitious themselves] for the moral edification of the reader. From mythical beasts to the lowly farm animal, all zoological data was meant to make man seek the allegory for God in a universe that He had created to His image. Maurice studies the process through which, for exam ple, the pelican and the fox symbolizing respectively Christ and the Devil, the signifiant is the description of the animal and the sign-iji the ((silent part of this entity made whole by a gloss.</page><page sequence="3">256 COMPTES RENDUS Brunetto Latini deliberately rejected this type of &lt;Nature&gt;. Like most other XIIIth century compilers who had studied at the University of Paris, he refers consistently to Aristotle, and the encyclopedic tradition thus became the source of bestiaries that meant to inform more than to moralize. The utilitarian role of animals is emphasized, but man can learn from some of them if he can understand their messages, although those are not directed to him. Glosses are no longer needed: the animal world is no longer abstract, and it is man who makes sense out of its behavior. Comparing it to the lan guage of the bestiaires moralisgs, in which animals are symbols or signs, Maurice analyses Latini's use of language to describe the semiotic universe of his pragmatic Livre des Animaux in which they are simple signals or indices to be observed and understood. The bear, often maligned or ridiculed in medieval and renaissance tales, is the subject of Michel Salvat's L'ours dans la symbolique mddievale. In Greek mythology, Artemis often takes the physical appearance of her com panion the bear. Arthur is the bear king, and Ursa Major, the Great Bear, is also called Arthur's Chariot. In heraldry, the bear represented brutal force and was often chosen as a warning of bellicose behavior. Salvat suggests that the disfavor of the bear in the teachings of the Roman church stems from Celtic lore where the wild boar representing the sacerdotal order, hence spiritual authority, was placed opposite the bear, making it the symbol of temporal power. In literature, it is their cruelty and their deviousness that was emphasized. They appear in premonitory dreams and in visions in the Chanson de Roland, in Tristan and in Arthurian legends. What made them a popular subject of folklore was their anthropomorphic traits: Salvat quotes bes tiaries and pseudo-scientific texts describing their upright stance, their behavior in mating [an implausible feat] and at the birth of their young. More appealing yet was their soft fur, not to mention that a tame bear could be made to dance and juggle to entertain men. This anthropomorphic quality of the bear, venerated and respected in Celtic and Germanic lore, may have caused him to lose to the lion the power and the prestige that he had long enjoyed. Because of this vague resemblance to men, bears were used for dissection in anatomy classes in Germany, in Spain and in Italy. Not only could bears transform themselves into men, but they also exhibited typically human flaws such as gullibility, greed and glut tony which the lion seems to have been spared. Salvat nevertheless concludes that it is the Church, imposing the written tradition and Latin culture over the oral tradition of Celtic and Germanic cultures, which brought about the demise of the bear as the king of beasts. Les survivances d'un mythe: quelques images du guerrier-fauve dans la lit tdrature allemande mdidevale, by Jean-Marc Pastr6, introduces the legendary warrior of Northern German literature: the man in a bear skin, sometimes called the man in a wolf skin. Pastre explains that the rites of passage of young warriors included drinking the blood of the bear or of the wolf they had killed, and as the soul of the beast flowed into their bodies, they acquired and retained animal characteristics, some of which were easily visi ble, of their prey. After bathing in the blood of the dragon that he had killed,</page><page sequence="4">COMPTES RENDUS 257 Siegfried somehow assimilated elements of the dragon's nature, including its strength and its fury, of which Pastre gives various examples from the Nibelungenlied. From Parzival, comes the legend of Feirefiz, born of a white father and a black mother. Rather than a blend of the two, his skin and his hair are black and white spots. Pastre deciphers this puzzle with the help of heraldic terms and a deconstruction of the hero's name. Feirefiz is in fact the symbol of a coat of armor representing both his parents and giving him his own iden tity. He retains the physical coloring and the nature of a leopard, an animal that was believed to be black and white. Other examples of mosaic offspring born of a woman with two men of different races, each contributing part of the genetic code, suggest that Feirefiz could have had two fathers, and Pastr6 also establishes an interesting parallel between this hero from Parzifal and the Mahabharata. In Passages de l'animalitg dans les aSonnets pour Helenen, Frangois Roudaut underlines the notion of human dignity according to which man can move on the scale of humanity from the angel to the animal, perhaps even to the stone. Bovelle's four steps are: stone [est], tree [vivit], horse [sen sit] and man [intelligit]. Roudaut, who sees these four degrees in Sonnets pour Heldne, assigns the word animality, linked to sensuality, to the third step. While the division between the third and the fourth is sometimes blurred, Ronsard notes that animals have immediate access to love, but that when man falls to this third level, he does not acquire the innocence that animals enjoy. He no longer looks toward Heaven but bends toward the earth. As long as he is obsessed with his love for H6lene who is, according to Roudaut, depicted as drawing him down to the third level where she remains, Ronsard loses the ability to aspire to the fourth level which should rightfully be his. Love, no longer an elevating emotion, is but a disruptive downward motion because the poet ceases to be a rational being. It is at the end of the second volume that Ronsard's poem becomes a commentary on his recovered ability to reason. Helene's silence is condemned, and the song of the nightingale, free from all bonds with humans, is the pure music that will allow the poet to ascend to the desired level of perfectibility. Since animalitas can be synonymous with sensuality in the original Latin, Frangoise Joukovsky asks whether it still carries a pejorative connotation in the XVIth century. In her remarkable De l'animal metaphysique d l'animal nu (Bovelle, Belon et Montaigne), she uses Bovelle's ontological model with which we are now familiar, but she also stresses that in this scale the animal, who can only see man, is not visible to those below him. At the same time, the opacity of the animal prevents the divine light to fall lower than it is and reverses it toward God. Man can then bring the creation back to God after he has transformed it into a mental world. Belon adds the concept of survival to Bovelle's mode. Through observa tion, he states that animals are mobile creatures that acquire enough infor mation to survive and that plants adapt to their environment. Although he may be God's favorite creation, man is only one among numerous species of animals, and he is part of a constant system of mutual participation that is organic rather than symbolic, for it is part of God's pre-ordained program.</page><page sequence="5">258 COMPTES RENDUS Montaigne's Apologie de Raymond Sebond demolishes Bovelle's model, for he does not believe in man's superiority above animals. He uses animality as a weapon against human presumption and sees very little difference between animal and human behavior from birth to procreation and to daily actions. Man's desire to learn or to know is not an advantage, nor is his imagination for it allows him to play with and distort truth, which animals cannot do. In conclusion, all three believe in a comforting divine plan. Man is part of animality (or vice-versa) above Bovelle and Belon feel that he must rise, but in which he must find his strength according Montaigne, who refutes their hierarchic scale. The last study in our review is Le bestiaire symbolique des (Tragiqueso [Book II and III] in which Roland Guillot analyzes the link between polemic literature and the satirical zoomorphic universe in which humans are stigma tized. Guillot traces d'Aubign6's vocabulary and its hidden meaning to vari ous bestiaries, raisonnes or encyclopedic, studied at length in several articles included in this volume. For d'Aubign6, as for their authors, the animal con stitutes the concrete visualization of a moral or social concept. aIt signifies something else in virtue of an analogical correspondence that finds its basis and its support in a global system of interpretation of natural phenomena. Among many examples offered by Guillot, the wolf (representing the ene mies of the people and a bad king (Henri III and his entourage) in Le bon chasse le loup, l'autre est loup du troupeau also ?reproduces the wolf sym bolizing the Devil 'who feels nothing but hatred for the human race' in de Beauvais's bestiary. Henri III and his entourage are thus assimilated to crea tures of the Devil. In other words, d'Aubigne's symbolic bestiary is a bes tiaire moralise in the service of satire ?reproducing the medieval dualism of Good versus Evil and of God and the Huguenots (lambs of the Church) against Satan to whose side d'Aubign6 places the Catholic, condemned with negative and deprecatory animal images. Guillot stresses d'Aubign6's didactic aim, reflected in the simplicity and the clarity of his style. His choice of univocal animal symbols in the context of an easily understood manichean world also contributes to the efficient form of discourse needed to better reach his readers. However, d'Aubign6's religious zeal goes beyond that of satirizing and his animal metaphors urge his readers to rise above the earth-bound level of larvae or lowly beasts. Once the mystical union of man with the great soul of the world is achieved, vipers of this earth will turn into unicorns or doves. His bestiary itself rose from satire and condemnation of evil to a spiritual message of salvation. Ten additional articles beginning with the seventeenth century, from La Fontaine to Tournier, follow those we have just reviewed. The depth of each of these studies and the multiplicity of their approach make for fascinating, if sometimes daunting, reading and reveal a nearly inexhaustible source of research for new interpretations.
