<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renaissance Studies Vol. 5 No. 3 Foreword Letizia Panizza The articles in this issue of the Journal take their origin from the Spring Symposium of the Society for Renaissance Studies held in Dr Williams' Library, London, 19 May 1990. The purpose of the Symposium was to draw attention to a rich but often overlooked area in European Renais sance letters, that of scientific and philosophical poetry, and stimulate further interest in it. Eight of the nine papers in this issue were presented at the Symposium. Can poetry deal with scientific issues? Can a poet do philosophy? Do the rigours of the experimental method with the accompanying search for utterly 'transparent' language exclude the poet's highly self-conscious preoccupation with linguistic expression and love of verbal ambiguity? These questions, with their underlying assumptions about the incompati bility of the medium and the message, of the imaginative and the rational, of the visionary and the empirically verifiable, are themselves products of recent times. They are the product of the increasing mathematization of all science, beginning with physics and astronomy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and extending to the natural sciences in the nine teenth and twentieth. Such oppositions would simply not have been understood in antiquity, the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, because the caring observation and recording of natural phenomena, and the search for the underlying laws of nature behind them, were shared by the poet and philosopher of nature (as he was called), often one and the same person. Philosophical and scientific issues gave gravitas to poetry; highly wrought discourse lent sublimitas to natural philosophy. The two disciplines, nevertheless, are not and never were inter changeable. Much of the poetry under discussion in this issue uses scien tific and philosophical information for other purposes. In antiquity the study of natural phenomena and of philosophy in general led to wisdom, not the modern goal of disinterested knowledge for its own sake. Wisdom meant among other things understanding your place and purpose in the natural order, and in addition following a way of life. 'Follow nature!' (Sequere naturam) was the Stoics' cry, as if an ethical code could be gleaned from studying the succession of the seasons. More than that, wisdom in the sense of looking for laws behind the phenomena often overlapped with theological questions: Who or what created the natural world? Will it last for ever? Does it have a purpose? Is there a providence? Scientific and philosophical poetry was thus often bound up with theology and ethics, with apologetic and moralistic aims. Since the © 1991 The Society for Renaissance Studies, Oxford University Press</page><page sequence="2">240 Letizia Panizza French, Italian and English poetry discussed here was written during and after the Protestant Reformation, defending 'truth' and attacking 'falsehood' were bound to be woven into the poetry's texture. At its most profound, the natural philosopher's wisdom still excited wonder, amaze ment, awe and reverence - sentiments the poet embellished by powerful visual imagery designed to move and delight as well as instruct. The nine articles represent very different approaches to the above issues: some focus on a specific poem or author, others cut across a wide time-span; some are literary/critical, others historical. They have been arranged in a loosely chronological order and grouped according to the language their subject matter was written in: Latin, French, Italian, English. All the same, there have emerged quite unexpectedly unifying strands. The main one is Lucretius, the great Latin model of sublime natural philosophical poetry, whether the relationship is one of emulation or denunciation or a mixture of both. His De rerum natura was a Renaissance discovery, complementing to the point of supplanting other Latin models such as Virgil's Georgics and Boethius' The Consolation of Philosophy. The Symposium was fortunatf in having David West, author of The Imagery and Poetry of Lucretius (Edinburgh, 1969), start off with fundamental observations about how his poetry works, and about his appeal not only to poets but to artists of Titian's stature as well. Charlotte Goddard illustrates fifteenth-century Italian humanist imitation of Lucretius, concentrating on Pontano's Urania, the first major rival Lucretian poem of the Renaissance, tempered doctrinally to suit learned Christian tastes. I examine how a century later Torquato Tasso composed the grand Catholic antidote to Lucretian 'poison', turning to Neoplato nism and Boethius' poetry; and Stephen Clucas' essay reveals how Lucretius' atomism, which meant the denial of divine providence, in turn fascinated and appalled a vast array of English poets. Commentaries on Plato's Timaeus and on Genesis which blend Neo platonism and Christian theology offered a viable alternative to Lucretius on the wonderful order in the universe, and another common strand is the exploitation of these for poetic use, by both French and Italian writers. Neil Kenny shows how changes in the notion of curiosité could inspire a renewed investigation into natural phenomena, provided the curiosité was not an end in itself! Jean Braybrook gives us an apt example of the frank apologetic use of natural science in French poetry, which, through a Neoplatonic interpretation of myth, even purported to bring spiritual healing. Noel Heather looks at Pythagorean number symbolism, also associated with Neoplatonism - number meant order, symmetry, hierarchy and perfection - in the creation poetry of the Protestant du Barthas. The above poetry is largely cosmological. Giordano Bruno, whose De immenso is a polemically Lucretian and Copernican anti-Catholic poem on the infinite universe, also composed the much lesser-known De</page><page sequence="3">Foreword 241 minimo, examined by Giovanni Aquilecchia. It is devoted exclusively to mathematics, with no apparent apologetic overtones, and could be said to outdo Lucretius in its virtuosity. Another poem standing on its own - its subject matter is physiology - is Phineas Fletcher's The Purple Island, composed in 1633, in what we would today consider the borders of the baroque period. In Tom Healy's exposition, we see how the purple island of the body is both examined minutely as in a dissection and treated as a metaphor of social, political and religious phenomena. Like Bruno, Fletcher is moving poetry in new allegorical and scientific directions at the same time. What emerged in the discussions during the Symposium was a regret that modern tastes have narrowed the number of acceptable poetic genres. On the other hand it was also pointed out that much experimen tal fiction is reviving devices of older poetry. Calvino's Cosmicomiche, for example, invite readers to identify with the mysterious anthropomorphic narrator Qfwfq, present at spectacular developments in the creation of the universe spanning billions of years. Imagination and metaphor, Calvino suggests, can give excitement and vividness to otherwise incom prehensible scientific hypotheses.
