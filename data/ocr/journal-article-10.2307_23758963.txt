In recent years, the site has suffered considerable period [Gifford 1976; Hellmuth 1988;LaporteandFialko 1987; damage from agricultural activities resulting in the truncation Laporte and Iglesias 1992;Reents-Budet 1994; Smith 1955]). of at least one structure (Guderjan et al. 1994:46), and the AlthoughcylindervasesarecharacteristicoftheLateClassic, exposure of bedrock in several locations around the site. In andareconsideredakeydiagnosticmarkerforthisperiod, with a diameter of 15 cm and a height of roughly 17 cm the Bedrock Vase is stockier than the quintessential Late Classic cylinder vase (Fig. 3). Although the form of the vessel may suggests that the Bedrock Vase is not of Early Classic period origin, stylistic and compositional aspects of the imagery more closely echo the artistic canons of the Early Classic period. The images are carved in low-relief onto the surface ofthe vessel, likely during the drying process when the clay would have been leathery. The removed surfaces are not smooth, showing signs of striations from the carving process. Carved vessels have been documented in many different areas of the Maya world and exhibit an equally broad temporal span (Coe 1973; Scheie and Miller 1986; Smith and Gifford 1965:507; Tate 1985:124). Al though this surface treatment is temporally broad, vessel forms and imagery (both context and style) are not, and examination of these elements permits us to narrow the tempo ral range of these ceramics. 100 km Fig. 1.

Each of the large panels is dominated by an anthropomorphic figure, while the narrow bands contain columns of images potentially stacked head-variant' glyphs'. For ease of discussion the panels are designated Panels 1 and 2, while the bands are referred to as Column A and Column B. The vase was carved, likely in a leather-hard state, with shallow bas-relief images less than 1 cm deep. Standing 17 cm high the vessel has an exterior diameter of roughly 15 cm giving the vase a squat, square appearance. The surface was coated with a blackish-red slip that has faded to a purple colour. The follow ing section will detail the imagery discovered on the Bedrock Vase. Panel 1 This panel is dominated by a large kneeling figure with a zoomorphic head and a human body. The large knotted bow on the hip of the figure in Panel 1 on the Bedrock V ase suggests that the loincloth is meant to be construed as a cloth garment. God markings embellish the arms and legs of the principle Fig. 2. Bedrock Site Plan Map figure, clearly indicating that this is a supernatural entity (cf.

Early Classic period. Rented here. Although the iconographic characteristics and details arc Early Classic in nature the composition and arrangement of the images on the Bedrock Vase are more clearly suggestive of early Late Classic period styles. Elaborate and crowded com positions, where the figures and their regalia overwhelm the panels and leave little of the background visible are typical of Early Classic pieces (Scheie and Miller 1986:193, 206-207 plates 73 and 73a), while scenes on Late Classic vessels often provide a more ample view of the background (Scheie and Miller 1986:287,296, plates 116 and 116a). Although the scenes on the Bedrock Vase maximize the available space, leaving little background visible, they lack the intricacy of Early Classic period images. Further, the fluidity and naturalistic rendering of the anthropomorphic forms is stylistically closer to Late Classic period painted polychrome vessels. Based on the fusion of Early Classic period iconographic styles and Late Classic period vessel form and composition the Bedrock Vase is believed to date to either the end of the Tzakol 3period(A.D. 450-600), or the early part of the Tepeu 1 period (A.D. 600-700) (see Smith 1955; Smith and Gifford 1965:503). In the absence of secure ceramic associations and contextual data, the temporal placement of the vase must, however, remain tentative as it relies solely on the appraisal of its stylistic attributes, without any corroborating evidence from a related Fig. 3.

Summary and Conclusion It is not the intention of this paper to provide a definitive interpretation of the iconography of the Bedrock V ase. Rather the intent is to present to the Maya scholarly community a new image for incorporation into the corpus of Maya iconography and make the vessel available for future study. If, as Stuart notes "narratives from Classic Maya mythology were fairly localized constructs" (Stuart 2005: 160), then we have a rare sliver of information about how the Maya in northwestern Belize may have conceptualized their myths. Although corre lations between the images depicted on the Bedrock Vase and mythological events recorded on vessels from elsewhere in the Maya world has yet to be determined, it is clear that the addition of new iconographic images is important if we are to continue to expand our understanding of Classic period Maya ideology. Acknowledgements I would like to offer special thanks to Christophe Helmke for providing the illustration of the vessel and for his extremely helpful comments and contributions that lead to the completion of this work. I would also like to thank Joel Palka, Antonio Curet, and Lorelei Friesen for their assistance in reading and offering revisions on early drafts of this paper, and to Nikolai Grube for his advice regarding the nature of the glyphs in Columns A and B. Thomas Guderjan is also deserving of special thanks both for providing access to the vessel in question and for his patience during the long process of getting the description of the vase to print. I am very grateful to the Institute of Archaeology (Drs. Jaime Awe and John Morris) for their support and kindness in allowing me to work in their country.

Resumen: En 1996, una cerámica extraordinaria fue descubierta en Bedrock, un sitio Maya en el noroeste de Belice. La cerámica se pude fechar tentativamente durante el período de transición entre el Clásico Temprano (es decir, Tzakol 3, ca. 450-600 d.C.) y el Clásico Tardío (es decir, Tepeu 1, ca. 600-700 d.C.). La decoración de la cerámica se divide en cuatro paneles. Los dos principales grupos de escenas retratan seres sobrenaturales entregando ofrendas, mientras que los dos paneles más pequeños contienen seis imágenes de cabezas. El objetivo del presente articulo es presentar un análisis descriptivo del Vaso Bedrock y agregar una pieza importante más al corpus de la iconografía maya. Zusammenfassung: Im Jahr 1996 wurde in der archäologischen Stätte Bedrock im Nordwesten von Belize ein außergewöhnliches Gefäß gefunden. Das Keramikgefäß datiert ungefähr in die Übergangszeit von früher Klassik (Tzakol 3, ca. 450-600 n. Chr.) zur frühen späten Klassik (Tepeu 1, ca. 600-700 n. Chr.). Das Gefäß ist mit vier großen Panels dekoriert. Die beiden großen Panels zeigen übernatürliche Wesen, die Opfergaben darbringen. Die beiden kleinen Panels enthalten jeweils sechs Köpfe. Das Ziel des vorliegenden Artikels ist es, das ungewöhnliche Gefäß vorzustellen und damit eine wichtige Ergänzung zum Korpus der Maya-Ikonographie zu machen.</page></plain_text>
