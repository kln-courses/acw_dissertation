Robbins and Christophe Boesch eds., Among African Apes: Stories and Photos from the Field (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011), XV + 172 pp., illus., $29.95 (hardback) Edited by two primatologists from the Max Planck Institute for Evo- lutionary Anthropology, Among African Apes: Stories and Photos from the Field offers a vivid glimpse of the experiences of field researchers. Composed of several stories, each written by a primatologist dedicated to both the scientific study and conservation of African apes, the volume transports the reader into a range of wild spaces, revealing the complex lives of our primate kin, the multiple ways human behavior is reflected in their actions, and the urgent need for conservation efforts to save the ever dwindling populations of chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas in Africa. For the historian of science and lay reader alike, African Apes pro- vides an interesting introduction to the science of primatology. Boxes containing background information about particular behaviors, such as infanticide and intercommunity aggression, are interspersed throughout the book. These, along with the volume's introduction, can be skipped by a reader already familiar with primate behavior but provide good introductory information and ensure the book is accessible to a diverse readership. The historian of science will find several aspects of the first-hand accounts interesting. Martha M. Robbins begins by stressing that fieldwork is real science and field researchers real scientists: "As with all scientists, we test particular hypotheses or predictions and use system- atic methods and protocols that are designed to provide specific data" (p. 17). Robbins also highlights how challenging field primatology can be, particularly in respect to finding and habituating apes. Many of the authors use anthropomorphism while carefully separating these moments from their scientific persona. After seeing a chimpanzee "spread-eagled on his back" Josephine Head wrote, "I feel as though I am looking at a person who has been murdered in a savage attack" (p. 105). On the following page she reflects; "I am only too aware that as a field scientist, I am expected to be objective and never to attach human</page><page sequence="2">794 BOOK REVIEW values to animal observations, but it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between the two when your study subjects are so similar genetically, and often behaviorally" (p. 106). Such recognition of the multiple facets of a researcher's professional and personal identity is a theme that runs throughout the book. Christophe Boesch, for example, uses phrases such as "the scientist in me was furious... but, at the same time, the man in me understood" (pp. 35-36). Other essays make plain the fact that long-term field research relies on the contributions of indigenous researchers and that primate conservation requires effective relation- ships with local people. Local peoples' perspectives on primates and primatology are mentioned, as is the expertise of indigenous researchers. Although the authors seek to focus more on the primates than on way primatology is done, a fuller discussion of the contributions of indige- nous researchers would have been a valuable addition to the book. Another interesting aspect of the accounts is the scientists' reflections on the potential costs and benefits experienced by the primates who are the subjects of long-term research. In a particularly moving essay, Boesch describes a disease outbreak in the population of chimpanzees he studies in the Tai Forest. Boesch described a night spent with a chimpanzee called Lefkas while Lefkas struggled to breath as "the longest and saddest night of [his] life" (p. 37). Boesch continued, "Now having to sit in the dark with a youngster I had known since he was a tiny baby, I was caught by surprise. Were we, the researchers committed to them, responsible for the disease and thus actually ignorant killers? Could we help them in any way?" (pp. 39-40). Boesch ultimately con- cludes that the benefits of long-term research outweigh the costs, stating that their "constant presence had simultaneously been protecting, not only the chimpanzees, but all the other animals in the forest from poachers" (p. 41). One of the most compelling characteristics of the volume is how the stories chronicle the lives of individual apes in the hope of "draw[ing] special attention to their fate" (p. 2). Essays such as "Is Blood Thicker than Water" that provide details of a moment in the life of a named individual and "Winona's Search for the Right Silverback" that spans a number of years of the life of an individual ape are particularly suc- cessful in achieving this goal. These essays sketch an animal biography that captures the complexity of apes' social worlds and creates an emotional connection between the reader and the welfare of other pri- mates. Including photos of individual apes in each of the chapters would have significantly enriched these life histories. Instead, the 32 photos from the field are collected together near the beginning of the book.

As historians of science interested in animal histories continue to stress, capturing the lives of other animals requires using a wide range of sources. Visual represen- tations of animals are particularly powerful ways to emphasize their individuality, with works such as James Mollison's James &amp; Other Apes demonstrating the potential for photography as a means of creating true portraits of individual animals. The volume's failure to do more with photos is a missed opportunity, one I suspect resulted from the fact that many publishers are reluctant to take on the added cost of integrating color images. Although visuals could have been better utilized, the volume does a good job of dealing with the unseen. Both the first and last chapter point out the invisibility of un-habituated and un-studied apes and the fact that their lives and sufferings are no less real than the characters we meet in these stories from the field. After Robbins shares a brief encounter with a group of wild chimpanzees, she cautions that "although it is easy to garner concern for the threats facing the habituated apes we dis- cuss... this glimpse into the lives of unhabituated chimpanzees serves as a reminder of the thousands of apes that are not habituated yet still facing increasing threats to their survival" (p. 28). By choosing to end the book with a discussion of the mystery that still surrounds the basic question of how many apes are in Africa, Christophe Boesch leaves the reader contemplating how many primates have escaped scientific study, living complex lives that include increasing risks to their survival. In conclusion, African Apes allows readers to access the experiences of field primatologists and the lives of individual primates. The book's first-hand accounts would be particularly effective in the undergraduate classroom as companions to histories of field science that contextualize issues such as anthropomorphism, science and postcolonialism, the human-animal boundary, and science and conservation.
