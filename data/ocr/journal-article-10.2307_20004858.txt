LANGFORD Professor of Philosophy, The Menwrial University of Newfoundland THE PROBLEM OF THE MEANING OF 'MIRACLE' The problems that arise over the concept of the miraculous are of continuing importance for the philosophy of religion, and because of their relation to issues such as the nature of explanation, and of scientific laws, they are of considerable interest to philosophy in general. The central problem is that of giving a satisfactory meaning to the word 'miracle', a meaning by which we can show how a miracle can be distin guished from other events, so that in principle at least, we can point to the criteria for marking off this event from the 'normal'. Unless some principle of recognition is available we could only know that x is a miracle if both this fact and its meaning were revealed, and this seems highly unsatisfactory, especially since two of the traditional uses of miracle have been to authenti cate and to teach. This problem (a), of giving a principle of recognition for the miraculous is prior to other problems that tend to be confused with it, notably (b), can miracles occur? (c), do miracles occur? and (d), in what social and religious contexts (if any) do miracles occur? I am concerned here with problem (a), and with the others only when they impinge upon it. Problem (a) can be approached by indicating the inadequacy of some of the accounts that are often given. One suggestion (S.i) is that a 'miracle is an event that causes amazement'. This certainly fits the casual use of the word, and particularly of the adjective 'miraculous', but as a serious account of how religious people use the word it seems inadequate in that it makes out the class of miracles to be a class of events which is relative to each observer, since it depends on what he happens to find amazing. This is not what most religious people mean by 'miracle', which rightly or wrongly they take to refer to an 'objective' class of events. A further suggestion (S.2) iS often made therefore (which may leave the amazing as an accompanying characteristic), namely that 'a miracle is an event that has religious sig nificance'. This is helpful up to a point since we do find that only certain extraordinary events are selected by religious people as being miracles (e.g. alleged cures, or spectacles that lead to faith or a new doctrine, but not the equally extraordinary birth of monsters). However S.2 suffers from the same kind of objection as S.i, for are not all events religiously significant to the eye of faith? Conversely, are any events specially significant to angels, or others who have all the faith and doctrine already? Some take the bold</page><page sequence="2">44 MICHAEL J. LANGFORD step of saying-'everything is really a miracle', but this must force the con clusion that there is no assignable class of miracles relative to all men, so that it implies the statement-'nothing is a miracle'. I am not suggesting that some kind of meaning cannot be worked out along the lines of S. I and S.2, but that if we are to bring out the significance of the concept of miracle as it has actually been used in many traditions, then the difficulties will lead us to a third suggestion (S.3), which does seem to accord with what most religious people are trying to convey. S.3 identifies a class of miracles by claiming a special kind of causality which contrasts with the causality of the 'natural order'. This leads to statements such as 'miracles are interferences in the natural order caused directly by God (or angels, devils, etc.), in contrast with natural events which God causes only indirectly': or (Hume's) 'a miracle is a violation of the laws of nature'.' Whereas S.i and S.2 seem meaningful in an innocuous sort of way but at the cost of avoiding the main issue, S.3 seems to grasp the real problem, but at the cost of appearing unintelligible to many people. In this paper I want to explore why S.3 appears unintelligible, and to offer a constructive suggestion, S.3bC, which is a variation on S.3 that preserves the usage of traditional religious language (i.e. that of making miracles refer to a class of events that is properly contrasted with the normal), while at the same time rendering the concept of miracle to some degree intelligible (though at the cost, I shall argue, of some consequences that may well be unacceptable to most religious orthodoxies). The problem (a) is most acute in the case of the suggestion (S.3a) that a miracle can authenticate both itself as being a miracle and also God, in that the event is an essential part of the argument that claims that God exists, or that he is of such and such a kind. The trouble with this approach is the main burden of Hume's famous chapter, for Professor Flew is surely right in insisting that he is primarily arguing that a miracle can never 'be proved so as to be the foundation of a system of religion'.2 Hume's approach can be pin-pointed in the challenge-would it ever be reasonable to explain an unusual event by introducing divine causation if we hadn't already got independent evidence for the divine? Would it not always be mnore reason able to assume fluke, trickery, or when all else fails, hypnosis? The force of this scepticism can be brought out by noting the ways in which we would in fact slip from one defensive position to another when faced with a claim that conflicted with our ordinary experience of the world. If a friend alleges that pink elephants are flying overhead we first assume that he is drunk; if he clearly is not we assume that he is joking; if we are forced out of this view by his seriousness plus the testimony of others, we probably accept the good 1 An Enquiry concerning human understanding: X, part I.

'You saw what looked like a pink elephant, but it was really a balloon . . .'. At the next stage of our defence we might be invited to see the phenomenon ourselves by examining the object from a helicopter, but even then, however the object appeared, we would probably reject the suggested interpretation. After poking it we would either say-'it is a flying machine, very cleverly disguised', or-'I am suffering from hypnotic delusions of some kind'. In short the proffered claim would be accepted only if it could be squared with our general experience, e.g. in another planet where there was less gravity. This series of moves seems to suggest that no event could stir a man to a reasonable belief in a special kind of event that evidenced a God (to whom he had not already some independent access). Here however I hesitate, since this position looks a little like that of the prejudiced theorist who refuses to admit contrary evidence. On the same grounds I am unhappy about that part of Hume's argument which implies that miracles (assuming for the moment that we know what they are) cannot happen, partly because I think that his position here is tautological-in the case of any event that is alleged to be a miracle we must look for a naturalistic interpretation (and here I disagree with Flew's analysis of Hume's argument).' It is true that Hume invites us to conceive of examples of miracles, but the examples are mis leading in that what Hume conceives are situations in which other people are mistakenly led to speak of miracles, not situations in which they actually occur. Thus for Hume miracles seem to be impossible in principle, not only because of the paradoxical conclusion that a miracle, if established, would destroy a law of nature, in his sense of the term, and hence would no longer be a miracle (which is defined as a violation of the law of nature)-but more significantly because his whole philosophical position would make him insist on an endless search for a natural explanation on the assumption that one must be there. This again reveals a paradox since his theory of law suggests that we can decide no 'matter of fact' a priori, while his dismissal of chance2 seems to suggest a Laplacian universe, a concept which could not be reduced to Hume's 'impressions'. (The explanation of the puzzle lies I believe, in a confusion between what Hume took to be the exigencies of certain necessary connections in the mind, for human survival and utility, on the one hand; and an epistemological theory on the other.) To return to our main theme, I think that there is a way in which we can combine the openness to unthought possibilities which we clearly need, with an acceptance of the strength of Hume's central argument. In the case of an isolated (alleged) event, like that of the flying elephant, I think that the sceptical line would be reasonable. In the case of a series of similar pheno mena one should radically consider whether one's general picture of the 1 See Flew, op. cit. pp. 178 and 201. Cf.

LANGFORD world did not need rethinking, and this might lead to a revision of what one considered to be possible. However, even if we agree that extraordinary events should, on occasions, make us reconsider what is possible, it is difficult to see how they could lead us to postulate the existence or nature of the necessarily unique being of God, given that we have no independent access to him. In addition to this philosophical objection to suggestions S.3a, one may wonder also whether it in fact accords with the traditional religious way of looking at miracles. For example, it is very important to see how different is the attitude of most Christians to alleged events such as the resurrection of Jesus, from our attitude to alleged events of the pink elephant variety, and not only because of the seriousness of the former. Nearly all Christians would say that they had independent grounds for their belief in God, and the suggestion that Jesus rose from the dead must take this into account (and also the extremely important claim that the alleged event is congruous, in some way, with a series of other events). Without this context it is unlikely that many people, in the first century or now, would have taken the claim seriously. (N.B.-The vast majority of the early Christians were religious before their conversions.) Indeed for claims like this to be acceptable without some special context the world would have to be very different, for what we normally hold to count as an 'explanation' would be undermined. It is even arguable that there could not be a 'world' at all (with the sort of stability, and reducibility to law, that make such a concept possible, let alone habitable). It is interesting to note that even William Paley might accept this criticism of S.3a since he attacks Hume on the grounds that he fails to distinguish the position of one who does not believe from one who does believe in a divine being 'of whose existence and power ... we have previous and independent proof... In a word, once believe that there is a God, and miracles are not incredible'.1 (Italics mine. Paley does not seem to realise that this position implies an acceptance of Hume's main argument.) In the light of the difficulties in S.3a which this discussion has underlined we must move on to the suggestion S.3b which abandons the dual role of miracles, and which claims only that 'a miracle is an event caused directly by God (of whose nature and existence we already have some independent knowledge) in such a way that the event must be contrasted with "normal" events.' For S.3b to be intelligible we need to be able to give some account of what 'direct causation by God' means, and how we can recognise its occurrence (other than by another miracle). In approaching this problem of intelligibility we need to differentiate between three types of position regarding the relation 1 William Paley, Preparatory considerations to Evidences of Christianity; Works, London, I 830, Vol. I, p. 7. However, cf. p. 3 where his position seems rather different. See also the appendix, An adequate occasion for the miracles; Vol. I, pp. ccciv-cccv.</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF THE MEANING OF 'MIRACLEs 47 ship of God to the world (although in practice these positions tend to over lap).1 They are as follows: S.3bA. God works only through 'natural' means, in the sense that the events called miracles, like all other events, are open to a straightforward scientific explanation in principle; but because we are only dimly aware of what is really possible we need to distinguish miracles, for which we have at the moment no ordinary explanation, from events which can be explained within the present field of knowledge. S.3bB. God is transcendent in such a way that his direct action is syste matically inexplicable in principle by any extension of scientific explanation. S.3bC. God's direct action is inexplicable in principle by an extension of physical laws, but it is explicable in principle in terms of another 'level' of activity with which we already have some familiarity, namely that of mind or spirit.2 There are obvious difficulties here since some kind of dualism seems to be implied which would allow the concept of 'mental causation', in addition to 'physical causation'. I believe however that this view can be defended, and that if 'scientific laws' are extended to cover all mental activity, it is only by so stretching the idea of scientific law that some dualism has already crept in unawares, hidden by the breadth of the term 'law'. I shall argue that positions S.3bA and S.3bB are unsatisfactory, but that S.3bC offers a possible approach, and one which will, I hope, become a little less obscure as I proceed. I think, moreover, that if it is desired to speak of an assignable class of miracles, one is committed to an approach along these lines. If the approach is impossible therefore, this may indicate that the word 'miracle' cannot meaningfully be applied to a separate class of events. The first objection S.3bA is that we are in effect back to the difficulties of S. i and S.2 since what goes into the class of miracles depends on the present level of scientific discovery, so that as before the class seems to be dependent on the observer's viewpoint. We have here a 'miracle of the gaps theory' that parallels the 'God of the gaps theory',3 and which suggests the gradual elimination of the concept of miracle. A second, and more controversial objection is the claim that in the case of many of the more important alleged events in the great religions any scientific explanation is ruled out. There is an interesting parallel here to the problem of describing the alleged phenomena of some psychical research (though there is the significant difference that many of these latter phenomena are repeatable, whereas 1 Cf. an alternative set of models relating God to the Universe by G. F. Woods in Miracles, ed. C. F. D. Moule (London, I965) p. 28 f. 2 Throughout this paper I have used the words 'mind' or 'mental' in contrast with the category of the 'physical'. It is possible that a better contrast might be made by using the word 'spirit', or perhaps the word 'person', in place of mind', since I am concerned with the essentially human phenomena which lead many people to make some such distinction. 8 Cf. C. A. Coulson, Science and Christian belief (London, I955), e.g. p. 64.</page><page sequence="6">48 MICHAEL J. LANGFORD miracles seem to be essentially unrepeatable to order, a circumstance which has been used to square their occurrence with the existence of a law which would otherwise be dissolved by the exception to it).' Thus C. D. Broad, for example, found it necessary to speak of the 'paranormal' in contrast with both the 'normal' and the 'abnormal', because of the way in which the alleged phenomena went against certain 'limiting principles' which he held to be assumed in all scientific explanation.2 One such principle runs: 'a person cannot directly initiate or modify by his own volition the movement of anything but certain parts of his own body'.3 To this it might be replied that if an event, whether allegedly paranormal or miraculous, is incapable in principle of scientific explanation, then it makes no sense to speak of an 'explanation' at all (e.g. psychic or divine). For example Professor Nowell-Smith has argued that any explanation must be capable of application to new phenomena; it must have predictive expansion.4 However, I believe that this approach oversimplifies the issue unless one is much more precise about what constitutes having predictive value, for both the paranormal and the miraculous may have predictive value of a kind. The crucial question is whether or not the application of laws and of explanation to mental phenomena involves an important break with their application to physical phenomena. If it does, then it may be helpful to talk of explanations that are not scientific explanations, and this will open up the possibility of S.3bC. When we turn from S.3bA to S.3bB we run into a difficulty of quite a different kind. The more that we emphasise the transcendence of God, the greater the problem of fixing criteria for the occurrence of miracles. This is of course one variation on the general problem that, as we move from an anthropomorphic God towards a transcendent theism, we gain in that God becomes less absurd as a claimant to worship or existence, but at the cost of losing the original intelligibility (e.g. of a super-man) and of generating an ever-increasing need for subtle analogy. With a thoroughgoing transcen dentalism it becomes impossible in principle to describe the nature of God's intervention. Despite this, S.3bB will undoubtedly be a tempting approach to many religious people, especially those of a more mystical inclination, but these people will be unable, in my view, to answer the question with which I am concerned, namely 'how are we to identify a class of miracles?' It begins to look therefore that if it is going to be possible to speak of a class of events as being miraculous, in any significant sense, it will have to be on the basis of some variety of S.3bC, that is of God working through minds 1 E.g. by N. Smart, in Philosophers and religious truth (London, I964) 2; 32. Cf. Paley, op. cit. p. 5 where almost the same argument is used. 2 Lectureson psychical research (London, I962)p. if. cf.

Flew and Maclntyre, pp. 249-51.</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF THE MEANING OF 'MIRACLE 49 in a way that is not totally dissimilar to our previous experience of minds (lest the problems produced by transcendence returns). From a religious standpoint there is a certain initial plausibility in this approach in that it enables miracles to be squared with the traditional reply to the problems of evil and suffering. This reply insists that in order to have anything recognisable as human nature or responsibility, we must have a world in which there is both a genuine freedom to do evil, and a stable system of laws which makes the consequences of human acts generally predictable. (For example, if God interfered in order to prevent car accidents it would eventually cease to matter how we drove, maintained cars, etc.) Miracles have always constituted an embarrassment for this reply since the type of theodicy referred to depends on denying that God can interfere without disrupting the essential preconditions of human life, while miracles seem to be examples of when God does sometimes interfere after all. The religious man thus appears to be trying to keep and eat the proverbial cake. S.3bC looks like a way out of the dilemma, although it involves the un orthodox corollary that God can only do certain types of miracle, that is those that depend on the interaction of minds. In other words, just as we don't claim that human interference in the natural order (which interference undoubtedly exists in some sense) vitiates the preconditions of human re sponsibility, so God's 'interference', I am arguing, can only be an extension of the same phenomenon, of a kind that also does not disrupt either human freedom or the stable order that is the necessary context for human life. There is a second ground for an initial plausibility in S.3bC. If we investigate the contemporary events which are alleged to be miracles, for example at Lourdes, and which have a fair degree of substantiation, we find that they are of a kind that with some imagination can be fitted into a psycho-somatic explanation (and I am suggesting that at least some such explanations are not scientific in any straightforward sense). The legless do not suddenly grow legs, decayed corpses do not get up and walk, but the evidence does suggest that medically given-up cancers sometimes wither, and that some paralytics start to walk. I would hesitate to call all such events merely abnormal, or unusual, partly because they seem to appear with sufficiently dramatic frequency in certain contexts, especially those of enthusiastic belief, to indicate an explanation on psycho-somatic lines. (N.B. The relevance of problem (d).) Despite these two grounds for plausibility it is of course true that S.b3C is open to serious objections, especially the following: (i) As I have already admitted, if we insist that explanations of mental phenomena are essentially irreducible to explanations of physical phenomena, we seem to have brought on our heads all the traditional objections to a mind-body dualism. I do not propose to answer these objections here (indeed I am not sure that I can) since I am more concerned with drawing</page><page sequence="8">50 MICHAEL J. LANGFORD out the implications of any insistence that there is a class of miracles, than in proving that there is such a class. However I would claim that this dualism cannot be ruled out a priori, and further that the two levels of interpretation (mental and physical) are not only brought in so that we can make room for miracles, but that prima facie we are presented already with these two levels in ordinary experience. Perhaps therefore the onus should be on those who feel convinced of the reducibility of one to the other to justify their reductionist assumptions. (2) Although according to S.3bC we no longer say that all events are miracles (so that we have delineated a class of miracles), it might appear that all events in which a mind is regarded as an essential part of the causal conditions are miracles, and this would suggest that raising my arm is as much a miracle as healing cancer. I think that there is an adequate reply to this, based on the fact that the model assumed by the objection is too simple. We have in fact three inter locking levels, rather than two, since we are using a model in which God is represented as a mind which transcends human minds, although he is sufficiently like human minds to allow analogical predication, so that we do not slip into position S.3bB. Thus God (i) works as a mind, in and through human minds (2), in the natural order (3), in such a way as not to destroy freedom or order. This model allows us to speak of grace whenever a human mind is illuminated or strengthened by the divine mind. That this in fact ever happens may of course be denied, but at least this model allows us to 'explain' many of the phenomena of religious experience other than in the sense of 'explain away' (and those familiar with the literature on the subject of religious experience may perhaps be a little sceptical of the reductionist assumptions which attempt to 'explain away' those religious phenomena, which fit so uneasily into the schematic model which the critic may have). Thus the suggested reply to objection 2 runs; a miracle is an event which is the result of grace, which in turn has unleashed little-known or unsuspected human powers, triggered off by the interaction of human and divine minds. It must be admitted however that this reply does not fully deal with the objection, for how are we to recognise acts of grace which are to be called 'miracles', and distinguish them from any more 'normal' contact with the divine mind, for example in daily prayer? We seem simply to have transferred our problem of identification to a higher level. What is the criterion for the special act of grace? I can, I believe, indicate the lines upon which an adequate reply could be made. Within the area of human interrelationships we find the need to make distinctions. There is, for example, heroic courage, and an extraordinary mercy, and above all the quite special love associated with being 'in love'. We mark off the everyday response, even of noble characters, from certain actions which overwhelm and amaze, because they break the expected</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEM OF THE MEANING OF 'MIRACLEs 5I pattern. It is a part of human freedom to live with this possibility. By analogy I suggest that God's relationship with men involves a similar discontinuity, one that is perhaps related to his freedom. There can be both a continuing grace, and a grace that can provoke a new vocabulary-including the word 'miracle'. We recognise the discontinuity, not by one simple and infallible test, but by a number of accompanying characteristics, parallel to the way in which we recognise that someone has fallen in love. The unexpected, the inexplicable (in terms of the ordinary pattern), and the significant, are all involved. In human examples, moreover, we are helped in our identification by the remembrance of vivid, personal experiences, and by an effort of imagination we can begin to see how there can be a similar discontinuity in man's relationship to God. Further, the history of the Hebrew-Christian tradition is highly suggestive of such a discontinuity. (3) If we accept the possibility of psycho-somatic cures, and if we think that this may necessitate a different kind of explanation, it may then be asked, why bring in the third category of the divine? While accepting the importance of this question I must insist that it too lies outside the scope of this inquiry, for I am attempting to provide a schema in which miracles are intelligible if we have independent grounds for belief in God, having rejected position S.3a, and having gone therefore half way with Hume. I would suggest, however, that if the three-level model serves better to interpret to us the whole range of our experience, then by its very comprehensiveness it has the best kind ofjustification that a model can have. (4) From the religious standpoint objection may be taken to S.3bC because it appears to lay down that God can only perform certain types of action. What then (a) of omnipotence, (b) of 'full-blooded' miracles, like turning water into wine (when interpreted literally), and (c) of creation? In outline my replies are as follows: (a) Is my suggestion any different in principle from the self-limiting of God that is normally allowed by theologians in the case of human freedom? If further limitations are necessitated as the preconditions of human life, then presumably God can so limit himself, or if he cannot, he is already limited in a more drastic way. (We are back to the well-known 'paradox of omni potence'.') (b) It must be insisted that we do not know the limits of psycho-somatic influence, but despite this I think it should be admitted that S.3bC does imply a scepticism with regard to those miracles that appear to be quite apart from the working of grace through human minds (with which we can plausibly claim some corresponding experience in the present). (c) Creation raises special problems, especially since this seems to be a divine act par excellence. An easy way out of the problem might be to say that 1 N.B. the remarks ofJ. L. Mackie in 'Evil and omnipotence', Mind, 1955.</page><page sequence="10">52 MICHAEL J. LANGFORD all limitations on God don't apply until after he has made human minds, since it is to preserve their integrity that God has to permit the preconditions of responsibility. However, this would be an absurd reduction of what most religious people mean by creation, which is a permanent and ever re-creative activity. Further, the manner of God's working is still left totally unexplained. Instead of this approach I would tentatively agree that there is a radical difference between 'miracles', as used in S.3bC, which occur within the created order, and 'creation' which is the very establishment of that order (and a fortiori is not something which will undermine the order that is necessary for human life), so that strictly speaking 'creation' is not a miracle at all. In none of the above discussion have I asserted that in order for God to act directly we must know something of the mnanner, and have some prin ciple of recognition of this action; I have said rather that a principle of recognition is necessary if we are to mark out an intelligible class of miracles. Accordingly I suggest that miracles are not utterly miysterious, in that both the manner of working (via minds) can in part be understood, and that we have some principles for recognising the work of grace. On the other hand any creation ex nihilo is a mystery, in the full sense, since to understand the manner of working seems quite impossible within the human condition. The doctrine is asserted as a result of the confrontation with existence, plus the belief in theism, but it does not pretend to delineate a class of evernts, so that it is a problem of a different order. I do not think therefore that S.3bC rules out the possibility of creation. In conclusion, I want to stress that this paper is not offered as a complete solution to the problem (a), but as an attempt to understand it, and to con struct a possible schema in terms of which the word 'miracle' can be seen to be intelligible for someone who believes in God, or who regards such belief as meaningful even though mistaken. (For the latter the class of miracles will have no members, but he will nevertheless know what the believer means when he speaks of miracles.) The fact that the schema raises as many ques tions as it answers does not, I hope, destroy its value.</page></plain_text>
