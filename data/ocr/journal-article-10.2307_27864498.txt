Othello: Why, anything: An honourable murderer, if you will; For naught I did in hate, but all in honour. (From Shakespeare's Othello) This article deals with homicides and blood feuds on the Polynesian outlier Bellona, in the Solomon Islands. Bellona is an elliptically-shaped raised atoll of approximately 20 km2, situated at 1 S, 159?15' E. It is one of the few Polynesian outliers in the Melanesian-dominated Solomon Islands. Although before the introduction of Christianity in 1938 Bellona's population probably never exceeded 500-600 individuals at a time, the islanders lived in a world of strife and social unrest. It is this pre Christian Bellona, with its long history of raids, homicides, vengeance killings and blood feuds, with which I am concerned. The homicide rate on Bellona ranks among the highest among non-industrialized societies. This paper deals with the conditions which generated this truculent behaviour, and tries to unravel the explicit and implicit rules governing the maintenance of blood feuds. It will be demonstrated that the principle 'Honour super omnia' is a strong factor in both generating and maintaining blood feuds. 1. Blood feud: a term with many meanings Reading through the extensive literature on feuds and blood feuds, one ' ROLF KUSCHEL obtained his PhD from the University of Copenhagen. He did extensive fieldwork on the islands of Rennell and Bellona in 1968, 1971, 1972, 1977, 1983, 1991 and 1992. He is presently engaged in a project to enhance research capacity at Tribhuvan University in Nepal. He is a member of The Royal Danish Society of Letters and Sciences. Dr. Kuschel may be reached at The Psychological Laboratory, University of Copenhagen, Njalsgade 88, DK 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark.</page><page sequence="2">Killing Begets Killing 691 can agree with Black-Michaud's statement that the use of the term feud 'yields a bewildering variety of interpretations ranging from individual acts of lethal retaliation for homicide, injury or insult, to repeated acts of full scale aggression between large ethnic groups whose adult male population may number several thousand strong' (Black-Michaud 1980: 1). Not only is the term 'feud' applied to cover a great variety of bellicose and belligerent phenomena, but it is also used synonymously with terms like 'blood revenge', 'vengeance killing' (Beattie 1972: 150), 'vendetta' and 'war'. An example of terminological confusion can be found in Knudsen (1985), who analysed vendetta on Corsica. In one and the same paper she refers to the various killings as 'blood feud', 'vendetta', 1 'war', 'private war' and 'family war'. Uncritical use of these terms has created confusion because different phenomena have been described with identical terms and vice versa. 'Blood revenge', the act of avenging a previous murder in order to terminate a conflict by re-establishing the balance of honour and power,2 is distinct from 'blood feud' not only in its course of events but also in its consequences. Although the political balance seldom changes very much after a 'blood revenge', severe changes do occur in feuding societies where alternating killings go on and on until one of the groups involved has been annihilated. In order to distinguish 'feud' from 'vengeance killing' the number of homicides or homicide attacks is crucial. There must be a sequence of at least three homicides or homicide attempts. In order to differentiate between a feud and 'serial killings', an additional criterion must be added. The homicides, as seen over a longer period of time, must reflect a pattern of alternating killings between the parties involved. 'Feud' should also be distinguished from 'war' since killing in the first case takes place within and in the latter between political entities (Otterbein 1970: 3).3 A prerequisite to feuding behaviour is the existence of group co-responsibility and liability. Before a number of alternating killings can take place, there must be groups of people who share a responsibility to revenge any brutal act committed towards one of its 1 It would be of interest to carry out an analysis of the term 'vendetta' in order to know whether it is synonymous with feud, as suggested by Boehm (1984: 218) or whether it is synonymous with vengeance killing, i.e. an act performed by individuals terminating the conflict, as suggested by Peters (1980: xiii). 2Blood revenge which terminates a dispute seems to be common among the Bedouin and rural Arab societies (Ginat 1987; 40, 157, footnote 2). 3Heider (1970: 100) regards 'conflict between men of different confederations of the same alliance' as feud, whereas 'conflict between members of different alliances' is war. See also Koch (1976) and Pospisil (1968: 392).</page><page sequence="3">692 Rolf Kuschel members and who are co-responsible for the conduct of their members (Gellner 1981: 37-38. See also Radcliffe-Brown's term Collective solidarity' [1933: 204]). Group responsibility and group liability are important features in feuding behaviour, because retaliation is not directed indiscriminately. In most cases it is aimed at the slayer himself or his agnatic kin. In the following, the terms 'feud' and 'blood feud' will be used to refer to at least three alternating homicides or homicide attempts occurring between members of discrete, autonomous groups (lineages, subclans or clans) who perceive themselves as being part of a shared political or ethno-linguistic entity.4 2. Ethnographic background 2.1. A brief history of Bellona Island What makes Bellona an interesting site for study is not only its small size and population, but also its long isolation. Before Christianity's introduction, contact with the outside world was scarce, in terms of interaction with other South Pacific islanders, as well as with Europeans and Americans (Kuschel 1988c). The Bellonese reckon their history to have started 24 generations prior to 1960, e.g. around AD 1350, when the first settlers arrived from Wallis Island and the Loyalty Islands. According to the islanders' oral traditions, their forefathers set out on a perilous voyage several thousand kilometres across the open sea, and landed on Bellona and the neighbouring island, Rennell. It is not known how many individuals originally left western Polynesia, but according to their oral traditions, eight couples are said to have arrived at their destination. As several researchers have demonstrated, Polynesian genealogical dating cannot always be accepted as a reliable source of chronological truth (Buck 1934; Sinclair 1951; Piddington 1956; Suggs 1960; Firth 1961). While Piddington (1956: 200) thinks 'that Polynesian traditions can hardly be admitted as possessing prima facie validity', he nevertheless stresses the importance of distinguishing between 'mythological traditions' and 'tribal narratives referring to the last six hundred years or so'. Whereas the former hardly contain any kind of historical truth, the latter may in certain situations reveal 'the nature of past culture'. Suggs (1960: 770), being interested in the relationship between radiocarbon dates and 4For a more detailed discussion of this definition, see Kuschel (1988a: 16-21).</page><page sequence="4">Killing Begets Killing 693 genealogical records, reached the conclusion that genealogical records are useless for objective chronological placement, but nevertheless may be used as 'relative chronologies'. Bellonese oral traditions and genealogical records suffer from the same ailments found among the tales of Hawaii, Samoa, Marquesas and New Zealand (Piddington 1956; Suggs 1960). Though the Bellonese claim the first settlers arrived 24 generations ago, i.e. around AD 1350, an archaeological excavation revealed that the island was inhabited as early as 2070 ?80 BP, i.e. around 120 BC (Poulsen 1972). The discrepancy between the genealogical and the radiocarbon dating in this case is almost 1500 years and thus too great to be dismissed. This lack of correspondence can be explained by cognitive and cultural amnesia. It is told that on their arrival, the first immigrants encountered legendary people called hiti whom they and their offspring gradually exterminated. However, since archaeological excavations have not revealed a specific hiti culture, they can better be categorized as legendary beings than as an ancient population. When dealing with oral traditions, which can pertain to events many generations back, it is not surprising that some data have been lost, reconstructed, or distorted over the course of time. Some examples of loss of information can be seen by comparing the accounts of killings which occurred in the first few generations (Kuschel 1988b: R3, R4) with those that took place during the lifetime of the informant (Kuschel 1988b: R145). The early narratives are often factual and pallid in form and content, whereas the most recent killings are described with an overwhelming richness of detail and in powerful language. Loss of information has also been documented within the genealogies. Data about the first ten generations are rather sparse and the names of the ancestors in the second and third generations were forgotten but later revealed by a medium. The meagreness of the oral traditions from the first generations is evident in Figure 1, which is a graphic representation of 926 identified persons' burial places over the past 24 generations. Of these persons, 66% were men and 34% women. It is beyond dispute that the early genealogical data are unreliable and should be treated with extreme caution. Much has been forgotten and one can not exclude the possibility that the early genealogies have been the subject of telescoping. From generation 11 onwards the oral traditions, and genealogical data, are rich and detailed (Elbert and Monberg 1965). Great internal consistency is evident in the data collected by various researchers working within several areas and using different informants and methods. Though the genealogical data can hardly be used for accurate counts of years, they reflect great accuracy in their relative chronology, and can serve as a pathfinder to the cultural past of the Bellonese.</page><page sequence="5">694 Rolf Kuschel 140 I 120-j 100 -j S 80 e I 60 J 40 20 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Generation Figure 1: Burials per generation of 609 males (black bars) and 317 females (white bars) 2.2. Social structure The Bellonese society was divided into clans, subclans and lineages. For the 24 generations the Bellonese claim to have been on the island, a total of nine clans, five subclans and 34 lineages have been identified from oral traditions. By 1938, these had been reduced to two clans, two subclans and 21 lineages. The seven clans were allegedly annihilated as a result of heavy losses during many generations of raids. A clan was 'a large patrilineal and patrilocal descent group, whose members all claim descent from the same first immigrant' (Elbert and Monberg 1965: 6). The clan was the largest structural unit and played a crucial role in the individual's political, economic, social and religious life. Members of a patrilineal descent group were formally obliged to help each other in subsistence activities, at rituals, when under threat or encroachment from others, as well as in defending the honour of the family, lineage, subclan or clan. Today there is a correspondence between clan membership and territory. One clan occupies the western part of Bellona, while the other clan occupies the rest of the island. This is, however, a relatively new phenomenon, as in the first fourteen generations the nine clans lived scattered among each other. Only</page><page sequence="6">Killing Begets Killing 695 subsequently has a merging of clan affiliation and territoriality appeared. We can get some idea of the early settlement patterns by looking at where the 609 identified males were buried, since a man - with very few exceptions - always had his grave in his settlement. Subclans were formed by fission of a clan. Besides being a powerful demonstration of the fertility of a clan, the establishment of subclans also reflects a survival strategy. By dividing an otherwise exogamous clan into two or more subclans whose members were permitted to marry each other, the chances for the clan's continued existence were optimized. This was very important in periods of much social unrest. Each subclan was autonomous and politically independent. Its members lived in close vicinity to each other, and in disputes the members of a subclan often united themselves against common enemies. It was also expected that they did not kill each other. This practice was followed for years by all of the subclans except one, whose members raided each other for years (for details see Kuschel 1988a, section 7.4.3). The lineage, an exogamous patrilineal descent group, was formed by fission of a clan or subclan. A man inherited land by virtue of his affiliation to a certain patrilineage whose members were expected to come to the rescue if one was threatened. Strife and killings within the lineage were viewed with great anxiety, as they always constituted a potential risk of splitting into new lineages. Since most lineages had a very small population base, this could have fatal consequences. Traditionally, the Bellonese settled patrilocally. In 1938 there were 82 settlements located north and south of the main trail cutting across the island from east to west. The Bellonese preferred a residence pattern where one family occupied a settlement of its own. The reason given was that too much trouble arose when several families lived in the same place. With patrilocal residence rules, the social structure of patrilineal lineages, subclans and clans constituted a fertile ground for the formation of what Thoden van Velzen and Van Wetering (1960) have termed 'fraternal interest groups'. 2.3. Social status and status rivalry The Bellonese did not have chiefs endowed with power as in many other traditional Polynesian cultures. The social hierarchy consisted of high status men, common landowners and low-status persons. The title of 'high-status man' was not a title which could be inherited. Each man who had the background for earning this title - i.e. the first-born son of a family who controlled fairly large land resources - had to make a personal effort to be recognized as such. He should be active, industrious, and</page><page sequence="7">696 Rolf Kuschet always be helpful to others. Through his own contributions he should add to the prosperity of his kinsmen. A high social status was thus the result of a combination of genealogical and personal characteristics. In a society where social recognition is highly appreciated and not automatically bestowed on members of certain clans or families but has to be earned, status rivalry is almost unavoidable. The oral history of Bellona contains several examples of lengthy quarrels among agnates about social status. Sometimes such envy resulted in homicide (Kuschel 1988b: R110). The foundation of the social organization was the landowners, of which there were 61 in 1938. Only men could own land, and those who did were formally independent, economically as well as politically. In reality, however, a landowner could choose to ally with other landowners or high status men for ceremonial functions or attacks. Had he enough land, crops, trees, manpower and other necessities, he could do as he liked as long as he did not transgress the basic rules of the society. In the case of land shortage, or if land was insufficient in providing some other ecological needs such as trees for building canoes or house rafters, he would turn to his kinsmen or affines for help. His authority was limited to his own family. Females could not be landowners. At the bottom of the social hierarchy were the low-status men. This group consisted mostly of fatherless people, though a few slothful and despicable persons born in wedlock were also incorporated in this group. It was characteristic of low-status persons to be weak, lazy, or physically or mentally handicapped. They usually had to follow the orders of high status men or landowners in order to survive, yet they were free to leave their mentors if they were dissatisfied with their behaviour. 2.4. Religion On traditional Bellona, religion governed and controlled a considerable part of daily life, such as pregnancy, birth, subsistence activities, welfare and raiding activities. The Bellonese themselves made a clear semantic distinction between human beings and supernaturals, a conceptual distinction to be employed in the following. In the traditional religion there were seven different categories of supernaturals: culture heroes, the island's aboriginal population called hiti, sky gods, district deities, unworshipped gods, worshipped ancestors and unworshipped ancestors. There was an active and lively interaction between humans and the supernatural world. Humans could communicate by way of ritual offerings and prayers with the sky gods, the district deities and the worshipped ancestors. The gods were regarded as 'anthropomorphic, anthroposocial</page><page sequence="8">Killing Begets Killing 697 and anthropopsychic' (Monberg 1966: 36), thus enabling human beings to communicate and socially and psychologically cope with them.5 Due to the very sacredness of the sky gods man usually, but not always, directed his requests to this group of supernaturals through his ancestors. None of the other supernaturals were the object of rituals - except for some minor ones to please the aboriginal inhabitants, the hiti. The success of a worshipper's approach to the heavenly abode would show in his prosperity, fertility and protection against major diseases, homicides and major catastrophes. The culture heroes were said to be the creators of heavenly bodies such as the moon and stars, and they were made responsible for how certain animals got their colours, appearance, and characteristic behaviour (Elbert and Monberg 1965; Kuschel 1975). They were also made accountable for the origin of certain anatomic peculiarities in human beings, such as their flexible joints, the female vagina and clitoris, and the emergence of certain forms of behaviour such as the killing of agnates and close relatives (Elbert and Monberg 1965: T31 [A]; see also Monberg 1966: ch. 8). The hiti did not play an important part in daily life. Only very simple rituals were performed for them, before going out fishing, because it was believed that hiti had power to keep the fish away. More dangerous were the harmful 'apai. They were the essence of evil and were made responsible for everything which could not rationally be attributed to the anger or displeasure of the gods or ancestors who were worshipped. The 'apai lived mainly in the impenetrable virgin forest, on the coast or in graves. From a western outlook, it could be said the 'apai were made the scapegoats for misfortunes that could not otherwise be explained. Most important of all were the sky gods and district deities. The sky gods, according to Monberg (1991), were related to nature, whereas the district gods were connected with cultural affairs. The sky gods had control over fish and garden produce, therefore offerings to them consisted of raw, uncooked food. They were violent by nature and sometimes unpredictable, even towards their own worshippers (Kuschel 1988b: R40, R79). As the highest ranking gods in the Bellonese world of supernaturals, they were in possession of great sacred strength (tapu), which made them particularly dangerous. Every person who came into contact with the power of the sky gods outside the formal ritual relationships was at a great disadvantage. The endless killings which have marred the island for generations, as 5Santangelo (1989: 139) believes that man ascribes anthropomorphic features to gods, because man spontaneously could conceive of it.</page><page sequence="9">698 Rolf Kuschet well as any horrendous and exceptional accident taking place during an attack, were also related to the sky gods. Before an attack, a raiding group performed special rituals (Jaiba) to reduce the victim's suspiciousness, enabling them to come within close range and kill him. As one of the last rituals before the attack, the raiders dedicated their weapons to the sky gods. In this ritual, the gods were requested to 'enter' the weapon and aim a lethal blow at the chosen victim. Without the assistance of the sky gods any attack would be unsuccessful. If unusual or socially despised behaviour was displayed during an attack, for example the killing of a brother-in-law (Kuschel 1988b: R145), signs were sought as an indication that the person had been temporarily possessed by a sky god. When during an attack a man gouged out his enemy's eyes, it was said that one of the sky gods had been on a killing spree and, arriving on Bellona, had heard the attacker call for assistance. Immediately, the god threw down his own weapons, took the attacker's hands and buried them deep into the victim's eye sockets. One by one, the attacker could then rip out the victim's eyes with his bare hands and throw them on the ground (Kuschel 1988b: R106). The district gods were of a more pro-social and altruistic nature. They protected people's lives, houses and gardens, provided them with offspring, and acted as a means of communication between people and the sky gods. Why, despite the care of the district gods, there were so many raids with accompanying homicides, does not seem to have particularly interested the Bellonese. Their opinions on this are rather vague. Ancestors were an important link in the interaction between the religious and the sacred sphere. They acted as messengers between the gods and the people. In addition to this function, ancestors were also important in protecting the settlement and its inhabitants. 2.5. Subsistence Although Bellona Island lies in the Coral Sea, which is rich in fish, root crops such as yams and taro were the most important sources of food. Unfortunately, we do not have any means to ascertain the quantity of the cultivated garden areas prior to the introduction of Christianity. In 1966, when Christiansen (1975) carried out his penetrating analysis of the island's subsistence system, 60% of the island was covered by tropical forest and less than 27%, equivalent to 465 hectares, 'was accessible for subsistence crops' (Christiansen 1975: 21). As large areas of the cultivable land in the period of investigation were either planted with coconut trees, lying fallow, or taken over for settlement, only 18% of the island's total</page><page sequence="10">Killing Begets Killing 699 land area was used for horticulture, equivalent to a good 306 hectares. According to Christiansen's calculations, about 500 people could live on the cultivated land, whereas 'about 1,000 persons might be able to live off the island' if the areas used for non-subsistence purposes were also cultivated (Christiansen 1975: 120-121). 2.6. Population The first census is a recording of the population in 1938, the year Christianity was introduced. The study reveals a population of 440 individuals. The male-female ratio was almost even: 218 of the inhabitants were male and 222 female. The age composition has been estimated to be the following: 49% were under the age of twenty years; 47% were between 21 and 45 years and 4% were people above 46 years of age. This age classification is an approximation because the Bellonese did not keep track of a person's year of birth. A tripartition has been selected in order to evaluate the number of the potential fighting force, which mainly consisted of what we call young and middle-aged men, e.g. men between the ages of 21 and 45. Statistically, 42.2% of the total male population was potentially fit to fight. When, in the following, we talk about Bellonese men and women, one should bear in mind that on Bellona, as in many other societies, there were great variations in people's behaviour, more than can be portrayed in a short article. Some men were vindictive, others more peaceful. Some strictly obeyed the rules of abstention from sexual relations, occupying the role of an acting priest-chief, whereas others strayed so far from these rules as to rape their mother's sister while occupying the same religious role. The same applied for women: some had venomous tongues and used racy vocabulary, while others were reserved. Keeping this in mind, we will now proceed to describe and analyse the Bellonese homicides, many of which developed into or were part of blood feuds. 3. Island of conflicts As mentioned in the introduction, Bellona was an island of strife and social unrest. The areas of conflict were numerous, involving claims to land, setting up of borderlines, rights of access to crops, fruit trees and timber for building canoes, envy, deceitful behaviour, spreading of rumours, denigrating insults, taunt songs, jealousy, and trouble between spouses and co-wives, just to name a few. The development and progress of conflicts depended on a number of</page><page sequence="11">700 Rolf Kuschel factors such as: (1) the type of conflict; (2) the strength of the parties involved; (3) the personalities of the people involved; and (4) whether or not a gift of atonement had been presented. If the conflict was serious and the insulted party felt strong enough to contribute to escalating the conflict, a homicide was planned. The characteristic Bellonese form of attack was ambush, utilizing the element of surprise. With few exceptions these raids were carried out by a relatively small attack force, consisting of six to eight men on average. They would sneak close to the victim's settlement at night and attack him at dawn, or they would steal up to his gardens and attack him while he was working. The victims were either clubbed to death with several blows from clubs made out of hardwood or clubs with stone heads, or they were killed by spears or arrows. Steel axes were first introduced to the island at the end of the last century (approximately 1870). Great courage was demanded for fighting at close quarters. Immediately after the killing, the successful raiders twisted off the legs and arms of their slain enemies in order to get hold of the long arm and leg bones (the fibula, shin, ulna, radius and hum?rus). These were needed for preparing spear and arrow points. 4. Results 4.1. Prevalence of raiding In the ensuing discussion, I analyse the socio-political implications of conflicts, beginning with the prevalence of raiding. The more than 150 narratives concerning homicide and homicidal attempts refer to 180 raids in which 195 people were killed. Most of the victims are named and have been identified. This number is a minimal indication, however, since several other raid stories circulate of which nothing more is known than the name of the raider or the victim. Unsuccessful raids seem to have faded into oblivion. In Figure 2, the number of known raids has been plotted. Relatively few data exist from the first ten generations, and from generation 11 onwards, the number of raids steadily increases, reaching a climax in 1938 (generation 21) with 35 raids in one generation.</page><page sequence="12">Killing Begets Killing 701 40-^ 35 30 -? 25 h 1 20 15 10 i 5 0 jljlJLj^ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Generation Figure 2: Raids (N = 180) per generation 4.2. Homicides It is not possible to specify exactly how many people have been killed on Bellona over the course of time. Generally, only killings of important people are remembered, whereas others disappear in the ranks of nameless extras (Kuschel 1988b: R36: 3). Of the 195 victims recorded, 8 were women and 6 children. Thirteen people were killed during the first ten generations, whereas 182 people were murdered in the following generations. For several reasons it is not possible to compare Bellonese casualty statistics with those from other Polynesian, Melanesian or Micronesian societies (see Livingstone's review 1967: 8-9). We cannot with any certainty calculate the average length of a generation and we do not know the exact size of the population on Bellona before 1938. Any attempt at comparison would therefore be a hazardous undertaking. Let us, however, assume that the Bellonese population never exceeded 500 people, and assume the length of a Polynesian generation to be 25 years. Restricting the calculation to generation 21 (approximately 1913 1938), the frequency of murder would appear to be 296 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. This is an astonishingly high figure, even when compared to the data collected by Knauft (1987). The Bellonese occupy a prominent sixth position among the most belligerent societies known</page><page sequence="13">702 Rolf Kuschel today (see Figure 3). But still, as stated earlier, these data cannot stand as hard 'scientific' proof, since there are, to quote Strathern (1972: 94), 'no means of obtaining etic "checks" on ernie statements'.

Ostensible reasons for homicides and feuds In a study of homicidal behaviour it is necessary to distinguish between the ostensible reasons for conflicts and the underlying causes. The ostensible reason is in some cases only an epiphenomenon. Something which appears to be the immediate cause can in some cases simply be the spark which triggers the explosion of a long-standing enmity. It may have been preceded by many years of constant provocation and harassment which escalated to such proportions that the injured party no longer could or would tolerate more humiliation. It is not, however, always easy to elicit the antecedents. They may have been forgotten - which is especially the case with the oldest raids - or the informant may not wish to speak about them because the events have stigmatized his own descent group. In a number of cases, such antecedents were uncovered during the collection of data in connection with entirely different subjects, e.g. humour. The underlying causes identified for raiding are presented in Figure 4.</page><page sequence="14">Killing Begets Killing 703 Cause for killing Number Vengeance and counter-vengeance 101 Usurpation or destruction of others' property Theft Land Fruit trees Property 20 9 3 7 39 Social reprehensible behaviour Humiliation Adultery Rejected suitor 25 6 2 33 Individual conditions Envy 4 In search of fame 3 Jealousy 1 between co-wives Unknown reason Total 190 Figure 4: Underlying causes for killing (Kuschel 1988: fig. 40) 4.4. Honour and vengeance One of the main underlying causes of the generations of bloodshed on Bellona can be found in the defence of honour. Honour must be seen not only as a private affair but as a social and cultural factor as well. Any dishonouring act against a certain person could be generalized to all the man's kin. Persons or kin groups who did not defend their honour would be socially dead. 'Honour and ignominy', says Johansen (1962), 'are as two poles in an evaluation. Honour divides human beings in two groups: those who possess and those who do not possess honour.' Honour can be seen as expressing vitality, whereas dishonour implies a reduction of it. According to Johansen, a dishonoured person can commit suicide, leave home, or take revenge. Since on Bellona it was very difficult to leave the island and since suicide was rarely practised among men, revenge was the reply to an act of ignominy. As Figure 4 shows, more than 50% of the homicides stemmed from a violation of other people's honour, since the killing of a man was regarded as a very dishonourable act. The idea of revenge and counter revenge was deeply anchored in the social practice of Bellonese society. An initial killing demanded retaliation in the form of a vengeance killing. It was an effective demonstration of strength. Not to defend oneself</page><page sequence="15">704 Rolf Kuschet would in the long run be tantamount to handing over power and dominance to one's adversaries. Vengeance or counter-vengeance killing was regarded as a re-establishment of lost honour! As one informant said: '[People] do not forget casualties from the past. They talk and talk and talk and talk, and finally take revenge. [They] keep [their enmities] in their larynx [seat of emotions], and when [they] get children [they] talk about it.' If the political circumstances were such that retaliation was possible, but slow to start, the potential attackers also exposed themselves to internal criticism and social pressure in the form of sarcastic remarks such as: 'All the raids on Bellona have been revenged, but Tauika from Ghongau doesn't talk about avenging the killing of Ha'uhenua [Tauika's father]. Does [he just] look strong but [actually] is weak'? The demand for vengeance was part of the cultural ethos and was implanted in each child during his growing years. 'One-sidedness is bad', they said, 'because it indicates cowardice!' 4.5. Usurpation or destruction of others' property As appears from Figure 4, only 20% of all the homicides on Bellona involved material objects. In nine cases the dispute led to homicide. In only three of these cases were attack groups formed for the explicit purpose of annexing other people's land. In each instance, the aim was to kill the last few surviving men of clans which were dying out. In other instances persons tried to acquire special land areas (as beach settlement, areas adjacent to their own settlement) from still prosperous kin groups. And in five cases obvious violations of land-tenure principles were set right again. Scarcity of land or ecologically needed resources could not be identified in any of these killings. Nevertheless, from a historical perspective, certain land areas have changed hands among clans and subclans. One feud, for example (Kuschel 1988b: feud 5), which continued for ten generations and involved 28 encounters between the antagonistic groups, resulted in the annexation of the defeated enemies' settlements and territories. And yet, in the entire history of this blood feud there is no evidence at all to suggest that it should be interpreted as a simple struggle for territory, or that the annexation was used to test the strength of the opponent. Annexation of other people's land was the consequence of lengthy struggles but not its cause. Some researchers believe that the hidden component behind many feuds is a fight over scarce resources. Vayda (1976: 84) even goes so far as to claim that it is 'the general failure of ethnographers to note the connections between the fighting undertaken for revenge and the fighting</page><page sequence="16">Killing Begets Killing 705 undertaken for territory'. In Vayda's view, acts of retribution can be seen as a way of testing the strength of the enemy for the purpose of annexing his land, as soon as there is any sign of weakness. Vayda continues, 'Following the process simply to a point where some groups fail to defend themselves or to retaliate adequately, and their enemies, perceiving this, respond with conscious attempts to conquer their land, is already sufficient to indicate a connection between fighting for revenge and fighting for territory'. This view does not hold for Bellona, where desire for revenge and the struggle to obtain retribution for being dishonoured were among the strongest and most unequivocal reasons for committing homicides and long-standing blood feuds. It seems that Vayda has devised a somewhat contrived explanation of the relationship between ecological and non-ecological sources of conflict. To suggest that the final consequences of feuds were identical with their causes would indisputably be a distortion of reality. Killing of thieves occurred mainly in connection with temporary food shortages emerging after hurricanes. Twelve people were killed when caught in other people's gardens. Besides being stripped of food resources, theft of garden products was considered a great humiliation. The planter felt he had placed his labour at the disposal of strangers, was dishonoured and had to take up arms against the culprit. The other thefts concerned mainly minor items such as a small plaited bag, turmeric, and human bones (to be used for arrow points). The value of the stolen property was of less importance than the very fact that somebody, by the mischievous act, had dishonoured the owner. Again we see an undercurrent of the culture's ethos: defence of honour. 4.6. Humiliating behaviour Social recognition, honour and prestige were highly regarded in Bellonese society. Nothing was automatically inherited; these were things that each person had to work for to attain. And they were something one had to defend. If one did not defend one's own social position, or that of one's family, kin or perhaps one's clan, something which had taken years or generations to build would quickly dissipate. So, if anyone was humiliated, it was important to take revenge. Failure to do so was considered a serious sign of weakness. The following actions were among those considered humiliating enough to lead to homicide: adultery, verbal insults, being purposely overlooked during the distribution of crops (Kuschel 1988b: R113), being accused of reprehensible behaviour such as eating taboo food (Kuschel 1988b: R98), defecating on the main trail (Kuschel 1988b: R120) or urinating in a water-hole (Kuschel 1988b: R3),</page><page sequence="17">706 Rolf Kuschel and being cheated in a malicious manner (Kuschel 1988b: R6, R87). In a society such as the Bellonese, where a patrilineal descent group's honour was constantly subjected to the appraisal of others, any attempt to besmirch it needed to be repudiated in a clear and unequivocal manner. The descent group could not afford to leave any doubt that it was willing, and had the power, to defend itself. Power and honour were very closely connected. An attack on a man's dignity was also an attack on his position of power and vice versa. 4.7. Feuds One may ask whether the instigating behaviour that set off generations of feuds was in any significant way different from the behaviour provoking other killings. The answer is negative. Looking at the nine blood feuds that have marred the island for so many centuries, it is surprising to note that these lengthy sequences of alternating killings were set off by seemingly minor events (Figure 5). But again, we do not know the antecedents of the conflicts; what to us may seem a trivial incident can be experienced locally as something very serious. Summing up, one could say that the Bellonese did not embark on raids in order to conquer resources but were agile in shouldering arms when their honour was jeopardized.

The rules of the fight In a society that places such great value on honour, and which is very sensitive to any attack on a person's status, one would expect every single instigating killing to be turned into a vengeance killing followed by a counter-vengeance killing, and thus develop into a feud. Such is not the case. Although ideally all killings and attempted killings should be avenged, in reality they often are not. Fifty-eight killings remained unavenged, and nine never went any further than the stage of vengeance killing (Figure 6). Considering the great emphasis placed on revenge, it may seem surprising that so many raids never developed any further. However, an analysis of the determining factors shows that vengeance and counter-vengeance killings were not simple, mechanical acts which started automatically. There were a number of strategic considerations behind each feud as well as behind the decision to let certain acts remain unavenged. Everyone knew that killing could provoke vengeance actions aimed at the killer and his agnatic kin. This could result in many generations of exhausting fighting during which the existence of the kin group would be placed in a grave situation. For this reason, killings of low-status persons were not avenged. It was not worth the risk.

To become involved in a vengeance or counter-vengeance action against a powerful enemy would be pure suicide (see Kuschel 1988b: R81: 5). The last large group of killings which were permitted to remain unavenged were killings between very close kin, such as patricide or fratricide (Kuschel 1988b: R97, R149). In these situations, other relatives tried to urge the parties involved to abstain from reprisal. Whether or not a killing should be avenged was based on rational considerations in which effort and risk were weighed against benefits. Strategic considerations for the survival and welfare of the patrilineal lineage were of paramount importance. 5.1. Who takes revenge? Feuding was governed by certain rules. These rules addressed the question of liability and co-responsibility, as well as whose lives, during an attack, should be spared (women, children, aged people, close paternal or maternal kinsmen, affines; see Kuschel 1988a: 222-223). According to social norms and the demand for group solidarity, it was the closest kin of the injured party who were supposed to take revenge. From the available data it appears that some 78% of agnates avenged their deceased kinsmen. The men who initiated retaliatory actions, 12% of whom were survivors of an earlier attack, were primarily those connected to each other by close emotional bonds: fathers, sons, or brothers. Besides close family members, more remote agnatic kin also took part in revenge killings. In a few cases several generations passed before the act of retaliation was initiated. In one reported case, nine generations passed before a man's death was avenged. Even though, ideally, it was demanded that all agnates within the same patrilineal descent group assist each other, both in matters of subsistence as well as in defending against attacking enemies, it was recognized that the ideal could seldom be met. Internal disputes, laziness, cowardice, and affinal relations to other lineages and clans prevented some men from co operating. If we look at one of the larger attacks, on which detailed data are available (see Kuschel 1988b: R145), it appears that the eight lineages which took part in the attack had a potential of 55 men of weapon bearing age at their disposal. However, of these, only 24 men took part in the attack itself, only 43% of the potential available force. As Peters (1967) has noted, it is an illusion to believe that agnatic groups will always join in a common cause. Initiating or participating in a retaliatory action was not, however, exclusively a matter for agnates. Sometimes the maternal kin and affines</page><page sequence="20">Killing Begets Killing 709 of the deceased would also partake in a raid, thereby paying their tribute to the deceased. This, however, was rare due to the danger of 'inheriting' the feud. 5.2. The selection of victims In a vengeance or counter-vengeance attack the selection of victims was also rule-governed. Retribution was mainly restricted to the raiders' close agnates and those who participated in the original groups. Out of the 116 cases where it was possible to trace the relationship between the victim in a vengeance attack to members of a former raiding group, vengeance was directed against the raider himself in 46 cases (40%) and against the agnatic kin of the raider in 39 cases (34%). In the remaining 31 instances (26%), vengeance was taken on members of the raider's alliance group. Neither the maternal kin nor the affines of the raiders were held responsible for the killings. The retribution principle was thus based on what may be called, using a concept of Coser (1956: 124), 'limited liability'. Even though the action was goal-directed, it differed from those in the blood feuds in other societies, for example, the Montenegrins and the Albanians, where action was based on the principle, 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth'. During an attack on Bellona, one killed as many men of the enemy's agnates as one could find. S3. Changing rules Because the available data on blood feuds in other societies seldom go back far enough in time, it has not been possible to determine whether the rules can and do change over the course of time. However, on the basis of the extensive data from Bellona, such changes in behavioural rules connected with homicides can be documented. The most important change occurred some two centuries ago, when a man killed one of his own kinsmen (his classificatory son [FFFFBSSS]). This homicide was regarded as a heinous act and created much disturbance on the island, starting off a long series of intra-clan killings. Killing of agnatic kinsmen thus became an integral part of the society and continued until 1938. As appears from the above, blood feuds on Bellona were strongly 'rule-governed', that is to say, determined by social rather than by individual norms. In spite of the many possibilities for random killing or killing for immediate gain alone, oral accounts reveal relatively few such instances. Bohannan's (1963: 290) statement that 'Feuds occur when the</page><page sequence="21">710 Rolf Kuschet principle of self-help gets out of hand' does not hold for Bellona.6 5.4. Processes maintaining blood feuds In order to understand the dynamics behind the generations of bloodshed, one has to elicit the processes that maintain the system. There is not a single factor which can be held responsible for the continuation of the sanguinary pattern of conflict resolution. Some of the underlying causes which triggered a killing, like the demand for vengeance, also functioned as the driving force which continued the bloodshed. On Bellona there was a strong demand to avenge an earlier humiliation, including a killing. A person who neglected such a social demand was publicly criticized for it and his children were constantly exposed to mockery related to the collective cowardice of their family and kinsmen. Society's demand for vengeance was a harsh requirement. As soon as the conditions were present, action was required. Being unable to take retribution made the survivors despondent. Sometimes a child, after listening to a story, would be directly requested to avenge an earlier injustice or homicide done to his group. A man, after telling his grandchild about some humiliating events which took place some generations ago, might conclude his narrative with the words, 'When you grow up, you have to take revenge and restore the honour of your family!'7 An extension and complication of the pattern of blood feuds took place as a consequence of the formation of alliances between different groups. These alliances could be based on kinship, as the formation of an alliance group between members of different lineages, subclans or clans. In addition, temporary alliance groups could be formed with maternal kin and affines. Such temporary alliances often extended the duration of a 6 Neither is it tenable for other societies like the Montenegrin (Boehm 1984), the Albanian (Hasluck 1954), the Bedouins or rural Arabs (Ginat 1987). 7 Children learned surprise attack strategies by way of imitation plays with adults and among themselves. These play attacks very much resembled the adult raids. While one group hid, 'the attackers' would try to sneak up on them. 'The attackers' let out the battle cry at the start of the attack, pursued their 'enemies', 'killed' them with spears (made of papaya stalks), clubs, axes and machetes (made from the butt ends of coconut fronds), 'chopped' off arms and legs of their victims (by hitting them with their clubs), and sang the victory songs. Their play was quite realistic and quite violent. It often ended with some of the players crying. This kind of playing taught children the important things necessary in a more concrete situation: stealth, cunningness, agility, quick reactions, cooperation, control of fear and endurance of pain.</page><page sequence="22">Killing Begets Killing 711 feud (due to the liability principle mentioned earlier), and also increased the risk of spreading it to groups other than those originally responsible for the first killings. One feud started as a clash between two men who belonged to two different subclans, the Matangi and Ghongau subclans. As maternal kin and affines became involved in the blood feud, the conflict changed after fourteen encounters to an internal clash between members of only one of the subclans, the Ghongau subclan. A similar development can be seen in another blood feud which originally started as a clash within one subclan, the Ghongau subclan. Because a man from another subclan, the Matangi subclan, felt compelled to avenge his affines in the Ghongau subclan, his own agnates from the Matangi subclan 'inherited' the feud. The reason for the spreading of such blood feuds becomes evident if one looks at the relationships among the attackers (see Kuschel 1988a: fig. 25). On average, almost one third were maternal kin or brothers-in-law. In this way the manpower available to the feuding group was increased and strengthened to the point where the feuds could continue longer than would have been possible between limited agnatic groups. Remembering that each member of the raiding group and his agnatic kin were considered liable for the killing, one has the key to understanding why and how feuds could spread and maintain the bloodshed for generations. 5.5. Are feuds eternal? While many authors do not deal with the question of whether or not feuds can be brought to an end, Black-Michaud takes the position 'that feuds are by definition eternal' (Black-Michaud 1980: 16). As Black Michaud points out, some feuds will be brought to a halt temporarily; one group may have lost a great deal of its men or be unable to reproduce itself sufficiently, in which case a retaliatory attack would be tantamount to suicide. Black-Michaud's view 'that feuds are by definition eternal' is, in its categorical form, untenable if one considers a society to be a dynamic organization whose members can at any time intervene in their own existence and thereby change it. This can happen, for example, if previously antagonistic groups become affines through marriage and decide to end what might be centuries of fighting (see Kuschel 1988a: 232). Black-Michaud's point of view is tenable only if one perceives the organization of the society as static.</page><page sequence="23">712 RolfKuschel 6. Discussion Though some researchers have addressed the question of the origin and development of blood feuds, no satisfactory answers have yet been presented. Around the turn of the century, Gopcevic (1881) laconically reduced blood feuds to a mere biological problem, claiming that 'Dem Menschen ist das Rachegef?hl angeboren' (The sentiment of revenge is innate). At the beginning of the twentieth century, there were psychological explanations such as the one advanced by the Finnish anthropologist Edward Westermarck (see Rivers 1926). The developmental history of human beings could, according to Westermarck, only be understood through knowledge of people's mental processes. He argued that blood feuds were solely determined by people's revengeful emotions. Whereas Westermarck attempted to understand blood feuds as individual phenomena, the Bellona material clearly shows that blood feuds are socially determined. The society not only accepts blood feuding as an instrument to re-establish a lost balance in honour and power, but even demands it, stigmatizing those who wait too long to retaliate. Westermarck's psychological reductionism did not remain uncontested for long. He was strongly criticized by the British anthropologist William H. Rivers, for whom blood feuds constituted a social phenomenon that should be studied and analysed as such. By taking the standpoint that social phenomena cannot be reduced to and understood from a purely individual-psychological point of view, Rivers was in close agreement with Durkheim (1982 [1895]). A radical change in the understanding of blood feuds came in 1940 with the appearance of Evans-Pritchard's book, The Nuer. According to Evans-Pritchard, the basis for the origins and development of blood feuds must be found in the structure of the society. In a classical segmentary system, such as among the Nuer, opposition arises between the different segments. When a man is killed, not only must his agnates take revenge, but his close affines and men who live in the neighbourhood of the victim must do so as well. In this way, 'whole sections are left in a state of hostility toward one another' (Evans-Pritchard 1968: 159). What this structural model implies is that every member of a certain group-constellation will always join in a common cause. This reflects an ideal rather than a real situation however. There will always be people or groupings who do not want to engage in a joint venture (because of enmity, laziness, cowardice) or who are prevented from participating due to kin-related or affinal ties. Stories from traditional Bellona are full of examples of raid leaders having difficulties assembling enough manpower among their agnatic kinsmen because there were too few strong and</page><page sequence="24">Killing Begets Killing 713 trustworthy men. In other situations, when the group against which a raid was being planned included affines of some of the raiders, leaders found it difficult to prevent these raiders from revealing plans of the raid to their affines. As demonstrated in this paper, only 43% of the potential available attack force participated in a lengthy and crucial raid which had been planned in advance. The two raid leaders in this particular raid did not have enough confidence in the other men. In view of such low participation rates, the genealogical model does not hold for Bellonese society. Lineages, subclans or clans hardly ever participated as a single group in an attack against other segments of society. As Peters (1967: 271) observes, Once contingencies are permitted to enter in, the lineage model ceases to be of use, for what is implied is that at all times some parts of sections structurally situated for feuding do not in fact feud'. This makes it impossible to accept an uncritical mechanical form of the lineage model as a description of real-life situations. Socio-structural models to describe the origin and maintenance of blood feuds have also focused on features such as (1) the absence of powerful groups with political authority, (2) the absence of regulatory procedures in conflict situations, and (3) the existence of 'fraternal interest groups'. Among those researchers who assert that blood feuds originate in societies without a central political authority which can maintain control and take action against emerging conflicts are Beattie (1972: 149), Hoebel (1974: 330), Middleton and Tait (1958: 19) and Thurnwald (1930: 598). Concerning societies containing autonomous groups, Thurnwald (1930: 598) writes, Tn the many small politically independent communities where there is no fixed authority, blood reprisals follow the infliction or the supposed infliction of injury'. However, as the studies of Black-Michaud (1980), Boehm (1984), Frauenst?dt (1881), and Hasluck (1954) have demonstrated, blood feuds also appear in societies with a centralized political authority. Furthermore, a cross-cultural analysis of fifty societies by Otterbein and Otterbein (1965: 1476) revealed that there is no connection between the degree of political complexity and the appearance or absence of blood feuds. The degree of political complexity is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the appearance or nonappearance of blood feuds. Closely connected with the theories concerning political complexity is the widely accepted view that neither the absence of arbitrating institutions nor the lack of alternative forms of conflict resolution can be regarded as the underlying cause of homicides in nonindustrialized societies. Koch (1979: 201) writes, Tt is the absence of regulatory procedures in conflict situations that leads to bloodshed and, sometimes,</page><page sequence="25">714 Rolf Kuschel to conquest'. Some years earlier, Harris (1984: 52) wrote, Trimitive people go to war because they lack alternative solutions to certain problems. Alternative solutions that would involve less suffering and fewer premature deaths.' Such explanations appear to confuse 'productive causes' with 'preventive factors'. The absence of one or more institutions or alternatives is unlikely to provide the underlying cause of the phenomenon itself. As Johan Asplund, a Swedish social-psychologist formulated it, 'absent factors can never be causal factors' (personal communication). On the other hand, one can say that once a society with a noncentralized power structure has established a violent pattern of conflict resolution, it can be difficult to intervene and control it. A theory which in recent times has gained an appreciable foothold is the 'fraternal interest group theory' developed by Thoden van Velzen and Van Wetering in 1960. They came up with a straightforward, yet very alluring theory: societies with fraternal interest groups are more violent than those societies without. A fraternal interest group is defined as a group of agnatic males who share some common, vital interests which they are ready to defend (Thoden van Velzen and Van Wetering 1960: 180). Such groups are most frequently found in patrilocal societies. Inspired by Thoden van Velzen and Van Wetering's study, Otterbein and Otterbein (1965) analysed the relationship between the occurrence of fraternal interest groups (indexed by patrilocality) and feuds. They found that 'societies with fraternal interest groups are more likely to have feuding than societies without fraternal interest groups' (Otterbein and Otterbein 1965: 1473). Twenty years later, Otterbein (1985: 80) even claims that fraternal interest groups 'are the basic cause of feuding'. However, the category 'fraternal interest group' is too vague to be useful (for a critique see Knauft 1987), and the 'theory' itself suffers from a severe problem: how does it explain the appearance of violence, homicide, vengeance killings and even feuds within fraternal interest groups? This issue became relevant during the analysis of the Bellona data. On this Polynesian outlier, killings of agnatic kin were found within the lineage, subclan and clan. Of the 180 raids, no less than 52% took place between agnatic kinsmen; participants killed their sons, brothers, classificatory brothers (FBS, FFBSS), nephews (BS), and uncles (FFBS, FFFBSS). Furthermore, in generation 18, two strong, antagonistic alliances were formed within the largest subclan. All members came from different lineages within the subclan, and they acted as allies during periods of social unrest. Keep in mind that these people lived in fairly close proximity to each other, the area of the whole subclan being about 10-12 km2. Thus, not only did agnates within a clan kill each other, so did those</page><page sequence="26">Killing Begets Killing 715 within the subclan. Besides agnatic kin, patri- and matrilateral kin, as well as affines, were killed. It is thus hard to see what kind of 'interest' the fraternal interest group defended. The fraternal interest theory certainly does not hold for Bellona. It seems that even the founders of the theory are becoming concerned, as they have realized, 25 years after the appearance of the theory, that there is a problem with the fighting within the 'solidary bastions'. They even expressed 'doubts about the theory in its present form' (Thoden van Velzen and Van Wetering 1987: 487-488), but a satisfactory solution to this problem still awaits an answer. 7. Conclusion As this short discussion discloses, researchers of blood feuds are still in search of a theory which can satisfactorily explain the conditions that promote the development of feuding behaviour as well as the dynamics that maintain it. There seems to be no doubt that the structural features of society are important determinants in whether disputes are solved in an overtly aggressive way or not; whether homicide demands retaliation; and whether vengeance killings restore the power balance and honour, or whether the fight must go on until one party has become exhausted or annihilated. One of the lessons learned from the study of blood feuds on Bellona Island is that an essential prerequisite for blood feuds to come into existence is the prevalence of honour. Honour is understood as a socially significant value one has to defend if attacked, because a personal humiliation is regarded as a kin-related humiliation. Honour and vengeance are mutually connected. 'Vengeance, then,' says Gr0nbech (1931: 72), 'consists in taking something from the other party. One procures honour from him. One will have one's honour back.' In our society we have come far away from understanding the vigour of honour. This may be one of the reasons researchers, until now, have been unable to apprehend that revenge is more than just a repayment of unrighteousness - it is a re-emergence of the vitality of a kin group's quality of life.
