<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CORPORATION IN THE POLITICAL THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS OF THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES* J.P. Canning I The corporation-theory of the thirteenth and fourteenth-century Italian civilians and canonists constitutes a major contribution to political thought. Their wide-ranging treatment of corporations reflects the structure of contemporary Italian society, which was dominated by interconnecting corporations of various kinds. The number of terms employed by these jurists to designate forms of corporation is correspondingly large, and includes corpus, communitas, respubUca, populus, civitas, collegium, and societas, although the most commonly used generic term is universitas. The political thought of these jurists exists very much within the context of their corporation-theory: it was thus no accident that the founda tions for the modem historical study of the political ideas of the medieval jurists were laid by Otto Gierke precisely within a treatment of their theory of corpora tions.1 One of the major forms of political corporation which the jurists considered was the independent city-republic of north and central Italy. To describe and account for this phenomenon there emerged a juristic theory of government by the people; and the rôle of corporation-concepts within this theory forms the subject of this article. The main focus will be on the works of Baldus de Ubaldis (d. 1400), a renowned canonist and civilian, sharing with his teacher and colleague, Bartolus of Sassoferrato, the greatest fame and influence among the Commentators (or Postglossators). Baldus deserves this attention because of the impact and importance of his thought, and the strange neglect of his writings by modern scholars.2 His ideas serve to illustrate the general problems raised by corporation "This article is based on the author's paper delivered to Professor Nicolai Rubinstein's research seminar on Medieval and Renaissance Italian history at the Institute of Historical Research, University of London. 1 Das deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht, 3 (Berlin, 1881), 186-644.

Why this should be so remains a mystery. There exist, for instance, only three monographs devoted to aspects of Baldus' ideas: Norbert Horn, Aequitas in den Lehren des Baldus, Forschungen zur neueren Privatrechtsgeschichte 11 (Cologne-Graz, 1968); James A. Wahl, 'Baldus de Ubaldis' Concept of State: a Study in Fourteenth-Century Legal Theory' (unpublished University of St Louis Ph.D. dissertation, 1968);and Joseph P. Canning, The Political Thought of Baldus de Ubaldis' (unpublished University of Cambridge Ph.D. dissertation, 1974).

CANNING theory, and in their subtlety and profundity amply exemplify the academic supremacy of jurisprudence in fourteenth-century Italy.3 II The theory of the sovereign, self-governing city-community or populus, com posed of citizens was amongst the medieval jurists first enunciated by Bartolus of Sassoferrato, and developed by Bal dus.4 An examination of the corporational aspect of the populus more clearly illuminates the views of Baldus and other jurists as to both the nature of the populus, and how it governs itself. Indeed, it is in the context of the people as an autonomous and self-governing corporation that Baldus elaborates the details of the people's structure of government. Further more the theme in the treatment of which Baldus surpassed Bartolus, namely that of full and active citizenship,5 can be seen to be implicit in the kind of corporation which the people is, and in its capacity to act and will and govern itself. It should, however, be said at the outset that there is some imprecision in Baldus' and other jurists' use of terms to represent the citizen-body, the commu nity of citizens. The most common, and indeed the major term employed by Baldus to designate the citizen-body is populus; and it appears most convenient to follow his usage in describing government by citizens as popular government. Other terms, however, such as civitas itself, commune, communitas, and corpus (civitatis or civium) are used interchangeably and somewhat indifferently in some passages for populus. It is usually made clear when universitas is applied to the citizen-body. Further the term, populus, itself can convey several meanings: the corporation of citizens;6 all the inhabitants of a particular place including 3 For the intellectual pre-eminence of legal studies in Italy from the eleventh century onwards see, for instance, Denys Hay, The Italian Renaissance in its Historical Background, 2nd ed.

In this last case Baldus makes it clear that the populus only corresponds with the city-community as a whole when the populus holds governmental power. Properly speaking, for the populus to be in this position it must constitute the unified body of the citizens.8 This view fits in perfectly well with Baldus' overall thesis of popular government; and as we shall shortly see the concept of the populus as the unity of the citizens is fundamental to his thinking. The populus in this last passage may very well correspond with the popolo of fourteenth-century Italy. The hint at the idea of a restricted citizen body (sanior civium unitas) suggests the familiar medieval principle of the sanior 1498, edition of Baldus' commentaries on the Digesta and Codex, 1-9 (held in the Old Library, Queens' College, Cambridge); the Pavia, 1495, edition of his commentary on the Feudal Law and the Peace of Constance; the Lyons, 1521, edition of his commentary on the Décrétâtes Gregorii P. IX; and the Brescia, 1490-91, edition of his Consilia (this is in five books: 1, 2, and 4 were published in 1490, and 3 and 5 in 1491). There exist numerous fifteenth, sixteenth, and early seventeenth-century printed editions of Baldus' Consilia. In comparing editions 1 have noticed considerable variation in the ordering of consilia within the overall structure of five books: the same consilium can, for example, appear in a different book in different editions. Much confusion exists: consilia are, for instance, combined together or separated in a different manner in different editions. To be able to say with accuracy that one edition of the consilia corresponds completely with another it would be necessary to compare every word. The Brescia, 1490-91, edition is a good one; and furthermore the references to Baldus' consilia contained in Diplovataccius' life of Baldus correspond to the order of the Brescia, 1490-91, edition (this is made clear in Diplovataccius, De Claris iuris consultis, ed. F. Schulz, H. Kantorowicz, and G. Robotti, in Studia Gratiana 10: 297-307). There can at present be no fully accurate assessment of the number of surviving consilia: different editions purport to contain different numbers of consilia, quite apart from those known to exist in manuscript form. The situation is further complicated by suspicions con cerning the genuineness of some consilia attributed to Baldus (in addition to the overt inclusion of some consilia by other jurists). The Brescia, 1490-91, edition purports to contain 2040 consilia of Baldus. Hermann Lange in 'Die Consilien des Baldus de Ubaldisfj 1400)',Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur: Mainz (Abhandlungen der geistes-und sozialwissen schaftlichen Klasse) 12 (1973), 18 also notices these points about the editions of Baldus' consilia, although he does less than justice to the Brescia edition: 'Einige Ausgaben enthalten sehr viel weniger Consilien.Z.B. bringt die Ausgabe Brixiae 1490 nur 926 Gutachten' (n.76) - Lange may well here only have had access to books 1 and 2, which purport to contain 927 consilia (the British Library, for instance, possesses a volume consisting solely of books 1 and 2). The complete edition is held in the Library of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. 7 See Baldus ad X.1.3.35, n.2, fol. 46r, 'Certe hoc nomen "populus" comprehendit etiam advenas, qui ibi sedem collocarunt'; and also id. ad D.3.5.3,1, fol. 175v, 'Hie quero utrum aliud sit dicere "civis", aliud sit dicere "popularis".

CANNING vel melior pars: the implication is that citizenship would depend upon some qualitative criterion. This suggestion is not followed up by Baldus elsewhere. Indeed, Baldus does not tell us anything about the composition of the citizen body: he does not discuss qualifications for membership of it,9 nor does he give any indication of possible sizes of the citizen-body in relation to the whole of the population. In the light of the restricted citizen-bodies of fourteenth-century Italy this might well seem a strange omission. The answer may well be that Baldus is interested in discussing popular government in general terms without exploring the details of the size and composition of the citizen-body, which would vary from city to city. A certain level of vagueness as regards Baldus' use of terms to indicate the citizen-body has to be accepted. Thus Baldus in the majority of cases employs populus as a term of general application meaning simply 'the people', without further defining it. In considering the medieval jurists' treatment of the people as a corporation the first question to ask is, what did they consider the corporation to be? For the Commentators and the canonists· (certainly from Innocent IV onwards) the corporation is a unity, one entity.10 A passage from Oldradus de Ponte must suffice to illustrate this: 'In sua constitutione universitas quandam unitatem constituit: ut unum corpus représentât, sic in productione actuum, qui progre diuntur ab ipsa, oportet quod sit unitas'.11 This unitary entity is composed of the physical members of the corporation. As a result the universitas possesses two aspects: it is both a unity, and also a plurality of human beings. Cynus de Pistoia neatly expresses this dual aspect of the populus: 'Licet populus sint plures, tamen pro uno reputatur'.12 The point is that a corporation can be viewed both as a legal entity distinct from its members, and as the men who compose it: the aspect which is stressed in any one place in the jurists' discussions depends upon the nature of the argument being put forward. The Commentators and Decretalists give copious attention to the extent to which the corporation is identified with its members or distinct from them; to the respective rights and obligations of the corporation as such and of its members; and to the location of jurisdiction within the corporation, whether in head or members. The Glossators, however, appear not to have so clearly discerned this distinction between the corporation as a unitary entity and its physical constituents; there is a current, but not universal, tendency among them simply to identify the corporation with its members.13 As Accursius himself says in a well-known passage: 'Universitas 9 That is to say apart from considerations concerning birth and legal enactment as the origins of citizenship. 10 See Gierke, Genossenschaftsrecht, 3:277-85, 362-68, and 425-36, and also Francesco Calasso, Gli ordinamenti giuridici del rinascimento medievale, 2nd ed.

It is arguable that there is a sense in which 'the people' or 'the city-community' is an abstract conception distinct from the members of the community. This abstract aspect was not seen in the same way or to the same extent by other medieval thinkers concerned with the nature, organization and government of society. The advance made by the Commentators over the Glossators is clearly illus trated by Baldus who, in his definition of the populus, gives a superbly subtle solution to the difficult problem of how to explain precisely the relationship between the populus as an abstract entity and its physical members. He takes up the statement by Accursius already mentioned, and expressly develops it by maintaining that the populus cannot simply be equated with the individual human beings who compose it. but is rather a collection of men into a unitv: Nec obstat quod glossa diçit in (D.3.4.7) quod populus non est aliud quam homines, quia debet intelligi de hominibus collective assumptis, unde homines separati non faciunt populum, unde populus proprie non est homines, sed hominum collectio in unum corpus misticum et abstractive sumptum, cuius significatio est inventa per intellectum.15 In order to express that the populus as a unity is an abstraction, Baldus employs here the phrase, corpus misticum, which is of canonistic, and ultimately Pauline origin.16 He is presumably using this formulation here to distinguish the populus in its abstract aspect as a corporation from the bodies of the men who make up the populus, which are real in the sense that they can be apprehended by the senses. This abstract entity (it is unum corpus) is a conceptualization of something real: the populus is composed of real human beings. Baldus is, therefore, careful to define the populus as a collection of men into a corpus misticum. In his defini tion he thus embraces both the abstraction and the men, who form the material basis for this abstraction. Elsewhere he expresses these two aspects of an universitas in terms of the relationship between materia and forma: Omnis universitas dicitur corpus, quia compositum et aggregatum. Ubi 14 D.3.4.7, col. 409-10 (ed. Antwerp, 1575). But see Walter Ullmann, The Delictal Respon sibility of Medieval Corporations', The Law Quarterly Review 64 (1948), 80-81 for Johannes Bassianus' discussion of the criteria for determining whether delict committed by all the members of a community acting together constitutes the action of a corporation as such (universitas), or is rather the action of that community's individual members (singuli).

CANNING corpora sunt tanquam materia, dicitur autem forma, id est formalis status (D.8.2.11). Est igitur collegium imago quedam, que magis intellectu quam sensu percipitur(D.41.3.30;et D.4.2.9,l;et X.5.39.53).17 Baldus' definition of the populus is crucial for his treatment of the fundamental question of whether, and how it can act and will — whether it can give effective consent, which it must be able to if it is to be self-governing. The conception that the populus is an abstraction appears to rule out any possibility that it can truly act and will. Baldus with his definition, however, neatly solves this problem. He admits that the populus is at the same time both an abstract entity and real men. Constantly in his treatment of popular government it is clear that he considers that the people can give effective consent: it can legislate; it can govern itself. Baldus never maintains that the populus as a conceptualization performs these legislative and governmental functions. In his treatment of the structure of popu lar government Baldus considers that the abstract entity and the real members are but two aspects of the same thing: the populus. This entity, the populus, acts and wills, in that its members act and will as a unity, that is (as we shall shortly see) either in assembly (unanimously or through majority-voting), or through elected representative councils or magistrates. In short the members are the physical expression of the corporation, which acts through its members who express not the wills of separate individuals but that of the corporation as a whole. Baldus sets out in general terms how a corporation exercises consent through its members: Verum est quod universitas non potest consentire antequam congregetur, sed postquam congregatur bene consentit ... Et sic corpus civile consentit sicut naturale corpus quia per naturalia instrumenta consentit, cum nihil aliud sit collegium quam homines qui in collegio sunt, et sic per homines ipsos collegium consentit, ut no. in (D3.4.7).18 The corporation thus consents in its corporeal aspect. It has no difficulty in consenting, because in one sense it is nothing other than the men who compose it. This corporeal aspect only becomes apparent and operative after the members have come together in a congregation. The point which Baldus makes is that, when it is a question of giving consent, the corporation in law (corpus civile) is none other than its members. That is to say the instruments for giving consent lie within itself: there is no need for recourse to any external agent. As we shall see, there is a direct application of this position to the populus: thepopulus can consent of itself, and does not require a superior to act for it. 17 Χ.1.31.3, n.7, fol. 116r. 18 D.29.2.25,1, fol. 97r.</page><page sequence="7">'THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 15 m Medieval jurists, however, went far beyond these basic concepts: they took the crucial step of maintaining that the corporation being a unitary entity is equated thereby with a single persona, that is to say a human being. The jurists thus arrived at the concept of the legal person. A useful definition of a legal person is that it is an entity capable of bearing legal rights and duties. This application of the term, persona, involves a recognition that entities other than individual human beings can bear legal rights and duties, and are, indeed, endowed (in so far as they can be) with the legal capacity of human beings, are in short 'persons in law'. This set of ideas may appear unremarkable to us because the concept is one of our fundamental legal tools. But the historical point is that it was medieval jurists who invented the concept of 'legal person' by being the first to apply the term, persona, to the corporation. Indeed, the equation of the corporation with a human being was a common-place in the works of the Commentators, and of the canonists from Innocent IV onwards. The concept of legal person is lacking in the Corpus Iuris Gvilis, where the term, persona, is not used in the sense of legal person.19 Certain texts in the Corpus Iuris Civilis did, however, appear to give some support to the application of the word, persona, to the corporation, and were referred to as supporting this interpretation by medieval jurists. Never theless it is clear that the original sense of these passages does not support the medieval interpretation, which was thus creative and innovatory.20 It should not, however, be thought that the full elaboration of the complex of ideas surrounding the concept of legal person was attained by the jurists of the thirteenth and four teenth centuries. For instance, copious evidence of what we may call legal person ality is to be found in their works; but there is no term for this abstraction, legal personality, as opposed to legal person. What we do see in the works of these jurists is a major advance in corporation-theory through the opening up of a wide expanse of juristic possibilities associated with the application of the word, persona, to the corporation. There is a large modern literature on the doctrines of the medieval jurists concerning the legal personality of corporations.21 Within this literature consider able prominence has been given to discussions of the fiction and realist theories. The reason for this is that the founder of the modem study of medieval corporation theory, Otto Gierke, whose great work, Das deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht, 3, still provides the starting-point for any such study, was primarily concerned with the problem of the legal personality of corporations, and argued in terms of the realist and fiction theories. His preoccupations have to some extent remained 19 See Patrick W. Duff, Personality in Roman Private Law (Cambridge, Eng., 1938), pp. 48-50. 20 The texts in question are D.46.1.22; D.4.2.9,1 ; and D.35.1.56. See Duff, ibid., pp. 20-21 for illuminating remarks on the original meaning of these passages. 21 For a recent bibliography see Paradisi, Ί1 pensiero politico' (See.above, n.l), pp. 156-57.</page><page sequence="8">16 JJ. CANNING with the subject in the sense that there has often been a tendency to think in the terms in which he thought or expressly to reject them. It would be ideal to be able to ignore the realist and fiction theories for reasons which will shortly be made clear, but their currency in modem treatments of the subject makes it necessary to consider them. According to the realist theory, which Gierke favoured, a group of men under stood as being a corporation has a real existence, and can truly act and will: in Gierke's terms it has a real personality.2 2 The fiction theory is more complicated and accords to the corporation only a fictive personality. I shall illustrate the theory with juristic passages which appear to support it. According to the fiction theory, the corporation as persona ficta is a mere abstraction and fiction of the law (nomen iuris): nothing corresponds with it in reality. Because it exists only in the mind (it is a corpus intellectuale), it is represented by real people, whether its corporeal members or a rector: it is thus a persona ficta et representata. As a result the corporation itself can neither truly act nor will. The unreal character of the juristic person in comparison with a real, living human being is summed up by the statement that the corporation lacks a soul (anima caret), and is thus in capable of truly giving consent and acting. A crucial point concerning the corpo ration as a fictive person is that as a fictio iuris it depends for its existence on the constitutive will of another (the person who makes or institutes it). This is made clear by Innocent IV, who according to Gierke had the major rôle in the initiation of the concept of persona ficta among the canonists, from whom it spread to the Commentators:23 Et intellige de illa universitate, que constituta per superiores, sic quod sit universitas, nam si tot homines essent simul collecti, quot sunt Rome, et non haberent taciturn vel expressum consensum a superiore, quod esset universitas, non possent sibi iudicem facere, nisi haberent alia iura et privi legium universitatis.24 By way of a penalty for its delict the corporation can be dissolved by its super ior. As Oldradus, following Innocent IV, says, it can be deprived of the privilege which originally made it what it is:'Sicut vera persona per mortem naturalem 22 For a well-known and classic exposition of the realist theory see Frederic W. Maitland's introduction to his translation of Otto Gierke, Political Theories of the Middle Age (Cambridge, Eng., 1900), p. xxvi, Our German Fellowship is no fiction, no symbol, no piece of the State's machinery, no collective name for individuals, but a living organism and a real person, with body and members and a will of its own. Itself can will, itself can act; it wills and acts by the men who are its organs as a man wills and acts by brain, mouth and hand'. 23 Genossenschaftsrecht, 3:277-85, 353-68,425-36. 24 X. 1.3.1.3, n.l, fol. 148r (ed. Frankfurt, 1570). For the rôle of the approbatio superioris in establishing a corporation see Walter Ullmann, 'Juristic Obstacles to the Emergence of the Concept of the State in the Middle Ages', Annali di storia del diritto 12-13 (1968-69), 57 (where this passage from Innocent is also quoted); and Gierke, Genossenschaftsrecht, 3:368-72.</page><page sequence="9">'THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 17 desineret esse quod erat, sic et ista persona ficta per mortem civilem, que est ut privetur privilegiis universitatis, universitas desinit esse quod erat, quia a modo non erit universitas'.2 5 The fiction theory is intimately linked with the concession theory, whereby a superior concedes to the corporation not only all its powers, but also its very existence.26 The idea that the corporation is a persona ficta persisted for this reason: although the conceptual jump of applying the term, persona, to the corporation had been made, there nevertheless remained in the works of some jurists a literally anthropomorphic conception of persona - that properly speaking the term, persona, could only be applied to a human being. The canonist Johannes Andreae provides an excellent example of this view: 'Nomina 'universitas', 'communitas', 'collegium', 'corpus', 'societas' sunt quasi idem significantia . . . ob hoc nullum horum est vera persona, que est rei rationabilis individua substantia;inde collegium dicitur persona non vera, sed representata'.27 This is an echo of Innocent IV's famous statement that corporations (including the populus) 'nomina sunt iuris, et non personarum'.28 In consequence the corporation can only be a fictive person as Innocent had initially maintained: 'collegium in causa universitatis fingatur una persona'.29 It was in great measure because of this anthropomorphic view that the capacity to act and will was in many passages in the jurists' works denied to the corporation. How could it act or will when it lacked the powers and characteristics of a human being, when it possessed neither a mens nor an anima ? If either the realist or the fiction theories are correct, then adherence to one or the other is obviously important for the question of popular sovereignty, because there is involved the crucial question of whether the populus can act and will, an essential prerequisite for independent self-government. In fact both theories are misleading and historically inaccurate. The medieval jurists' ideas simply do not fit into realist or fiction theories which are essentially modem categories. This has certainly been my experience from studying their writings.30 Although 25 Cons., 65, n.8, fol. 23r (ed. Lyons, 1550).

CANNING support for fiction or realist theories can be found by selective reading of these sources, any attempt to fit the jurists' doctrines into either theory results only in the discovery of so-called 'inconsistencies' (and Gierke himself admitted the existence of these),31 which are then deplored. To obtain a balanced view of a jurist's doctrines it is necessary to read his whole opus. The major point is that the medieval jurists in their corporation-theories were only partly concerned with the problem of legal personality: it was far from being their major pre occupation, and they accorded far more space to the structure of the corporation, the location of jurisdiction within it, and other questions. Indeed it is normally the case that passages can be extracted from the work of the same jurist to support both the fiction and the realist theories. An illustration of this misleading method would of course be the way in which I had to select passages to support my account of the fiction theory. A major methodological problem in establishing the theories of the medieval jurists is imposed by the vast bulk of their writings. Modem scholars tend to dip into them; and they often find just what they want. Furthermore the adoption by a jurist of a persona ficta concept does not thereby imply that he adheres to the full-scale fiction theory which is essentially a modern way of thinking.3 2 In any case the medieval jurists do not use the concept of fiction in a derogatory or pejorative sense ; rather for them fictions of the law have the positive function of creating legal entities, relations and capacities which do not exist in reality outside the law.33 Thus Oldradus, for example, in considering the case of delict, constructively uses fiction to endow a corporation with legal personality, the possession of an anima and the associated capacity to act: Universitas sive collegium non habent veram personam nec animam, quia nomina sunt iuris, et quantum ad rei veritatem, cum animam non habeant, Walter Ullmann, 'The Delictal Responsibility of Medieval Corporations', (See above, n. 14), pp. 78-96.

Lewis, The Genossenschaft Theory of Otto von Gierke: a Study in Political Thought, University of Wisconsin Studies in the Social Sciences and History 25 (Madison, Wisconsin, 1935).

Sed licet non habeant veram personam, tamen habent personam fictam fictione iuris. Et ideo dicit lex quod municipium, curia, et societas vicem persone sustinent (D.46.1.22), et sic eadem fictione animam habent, et delinquere possunt et puniri ea tamen pena, que possit cadere in eis.34 This passage immediately precedes that already quoted3 s which can now be seen to signify simply that a corporation which is a creation of legal enactment can be dissolved by the same method; it is thus not necessary to see the fiction theory in operation in the passage as a whole. In general the jurists in their treat ment of the populus use the concept of fiction as legal terminology to convey that the populus in its abstract aspect has legal existence and capacity. On the crucial question of the possession of jurisdiction by the corporation, a major aspect of its capacity to act and will, there is, according to Tierney, among the Decretalists of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries a growing orthodoxy that jurisdiction lies with all the members of the corporation not just with the head, as Innocent IV and Johannes Andreae tended to maintain36 (a view essential to the fiction theory: the head is given authority by the superior, and acts for the members who cannot act for themselves). Certainly among the civilians, when we arrive at the works of Bartolus and Baldus, we find that the sovereign populus, for instance, very clearly possesses full powers of jurisdiction, and can truly act and will. When we look at Baldus' treatment of the populus as a corporation, we see that, in order to express the dual nature of that populus as a unity composed of its corporeal members, he adopts the normal juristic equation of the populus with a single persona, that is a human being: Omnis numerus eorum, qui loco unius substituuntur, pro singulari persona habendus est, ut (D.35.1.56). Est et quedam persona universalis que unius persone intellectum habet, tamen ex multis corporibus constat, ut populus, ut (D.46.1.22); et hec persona similiter loco unius habetur et individuum corpus reputatur . . . facit (D.4.2.9,1). Patet ergo quod hoc nomen persona quandoque ponitur pro singulari quandoque pro universali quandoque pro capite sive prelato, ut (X.3.5.28).3 7 Baldus neatly describes this corporate person as a persona universalis - the person which an universitas is: one person composed of many. As we have seen, a legal person may be defined as an entity capable of bearing 34 Cons., 65, n.7, fol. 23r. 35 See above, p. 16. 36 Foundations, pp. 117, 130, and 136, n. 4. 37 C.6.26.2.</page><page sequence="12">20 J.P. CANNING legal rights and duties. But this definition leaves open the question of the extent of its legal capacity. The legal capacity, which Baldus accords to the populus, is related to the status in law of the persona with whom he identifies it. The clue to the legal status of that persona is to be found in that of the members of the populus. The passage, which I have already quoted, from his commentary on C.7.53.5 containing a definition of the populus38 is followed immediately by that concerning citizenship, where Baldus introduced for the first time into medieval jurisprudence the conception of the populus as being composed of citizens under stood in the ultimately Aristotelian sense of natural, political men: Tertio modo (homo) potest considerari prout est quoddam corpus civile seu politicum ... Si consideratur in congregatione tunc homo naturalis efficeretur politicus, et ex multis aggregatis fit populus ut (D.41.3.30). Iste populus quandoque mûris cingitur, et incolit civitatem;et idem proprie dicitur politicus a polis quod est civitas.39 Baldus perceives that the individual is changed by membership of a corporation: by dint of being subsumed into a unity, an entity of this kind, he takes on a special characteristic. In so far as he is a member of a corporation he ceases to be an isolated individual (homo separatus). As we see, in the case of the populus which inhabits a city, Baldus maintains that this special characteristic is a political one. That is to say, a man incorporated into that populus becomes a citizen. A citizen is a member of such a corporation and not an isolated individual. What Baldus has done is to link the idea of man as a member of the populus, which is a corporation, with the concept of man the citizen. The point is that the legal capacity of the free and autonomous populus resembles that of a citizen, because the populus is the corporation of the citizens. The independent populus is, as it were, a citizen, who governs himself, writ large. The conception of full and active citizenship is implicit in Baldus' idea of the autonomous populus as a corporation. This is shown by the self-governing structure of such a populus, and by its full capacity to will and act of itself and on its own behalf; that is to say, by the full political and legal independence of the body of citizens. Walter Ullmann has expressed the idea that there is a connection between the individual as subditus, and the concep tualizing of the corporation of such individuals as a persona ficta: just as the subditus is dependent for his rights on the grace of his superior, so the corporation as persona ficta has its rights, and indeed its very existence, conceded to it by its superior.40 There is no such idea in Baldus' conception of the independent populus. The appeal to nature is crucial here. Baldus' innovatory resort to the 38 See above, p. 13. 39 The concept of natural, political man was, of course, part of the common-coin of political thought in the fourteenth century. The use of it might seem unremarkable enough;'but the fact remains that Baldus was the first jurist to use the concept as the basis for a theory of citizenship seen as part of a thesis of the sovereignty of the people. For full details see Canning, Ά Fourteenth-Century Contribution' (See above, n.5). 40 See 'Juristic Obstacles', pp. 60-62.</page><page sequence="13">'THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 21 concept of natural, political man by-passes the theocratic system, which claimed a divine source for rulership and a divinely-sanctioned submission of the individual as a mere subject to his monarch. The adoption of the concept of natural, political man facilitates the development of that of the citizen who governs himself by his own consent untrammelled by the restrictions of the theocratic system. In Baldus' political theory it is this concept of natural, political man which forms the philo sophical foundation for the whole structure of his theory of popular government. The theocratic superior is excluded as the source of the people's power. The citizen has autonomous rights which are implicit in the autonomous rights of the populus itself. Indeed, in a passage of the highest originality in the context of medieval juristic writings Baldus goes so far as to say expressly that this corporation of citizens is identified not just with any persona, but specifically with a persona politico: 'Si est congregata (i.e. universitas ) personaliter citabitur, quia ista congregatio est quasi quedam persona politica'.41 This passage occurs later in his commentary than the passages already quoted. Baldus realizes that he is making a uaiing suucmciu. uus is reiiecieu in uic tentative nature 01 ills language [quasi quedam persona politico). If taken up by later jurists and political thinkers this formula could have very great possibilities in the context of the theme of popular government: it could be applied to an entity capable of governing itself by the exercise of its own consent. Baldus' use here of the phrase, persona politico, should be understood as only providing the germ of this idea, because at this particular point in his commentary on C.7.53.5 he is discussing a corporation of citizens, which does not appear to be sovereign in that it can be summoned in law.42 Further Baldus limits the application of the term, persona politico, to the corporation of citizens in its corporeal aspect, which appears in congregation, and does not apply it to that corporation in its abstract aspect. There is no question of the identification of the corporation of citizens as an abstraction with a political person. It is certainly true that Baldus' views concerning the populus as a corporation, like Bartolus' also, cannot be fitted into a fiction theory in the modern sense.43 41 C.7.53.5 (this passage occurs later in Baldus' commentary than the passages already cited). Gierke, Genossenschaftsrecht, 3:426, n.26, refers to this phrase (in this passage), but does not explore its implications for the themes of citizenship and popular government. 42 See also Baldus ad D.3.4.1,2, n.1-2, fol. 212v (ed. Lyons, 1585): 'Ego dico, quod quando civitas, vel universitas non habet syndicum, quod est duplex modus citandi, scilicet in persona, et ad domum. Tunc dicitur personaliter citari quando citatur congregate in capitulo, vel arengo . . . Nam idem est modus citandi contra civitatem, et universitatem, sicut contra singularem personam, ut hie'. 43 Bartolus, for instance, considers that the city-community as a corporation is a person by fiction of the law, but that this fiction does not incapacitate the corporation - rather there are actions which only this corporation can perform: 'proprie (universitas) non est persona, ut dictum est, tamen hoc est Return positum pro vero, sicut ponimus nos iuriste . . . Quedam sunt que tan turn fieri possunt per ipsam universitatem, ut facere statuta, dare iurisdictionem, imponere collectas, et similia' (ad D.48.19.16, s.v. 'Nonnunquam', n.4, fol. 200r, ed. Turin, 1577).</page><page sequence="14">22 J.P. CANNING There are a very few passages which could be fitted into such a theory, but the overwhelming weight of evidence in Baldus' works is that the sovereign community of citizens in the exercise of its jurisdiction acts and wills autonomously without any breath of fiction. Furthermore, at a fundamental level of his theory of popular government Baldus puts forward a point-of-view which cannot be reconciled with the very basis of the fiction theory. As we have seen, it is fundamental to the fiction theory that the corporation is man-made (by a superior), that it is arti ficial: in this sense it is a fictio iuris. Baldus expresses this point of view very clearly as regards one form of corporation — a collegium: 'Cum vera predicatio sit de rebus naturalibus et non fictis, et collegium non natura sed artificio hominum constat, merito non continetur appellatione persone, nisi per interpretationem extensivam'.44 Baldus, however, considers that the city-community is not like other corporations in that it is no artificial creation, being rather the product of man's political nature. In purely juristic terms it gains its existence and its powers of jurisdiction, not from any legally constitutive act of a superior, but from the ius gentium itself: 'Populi sunt de iure gentium ergo regimen populi est de iure gentium . . . Eo ipso quod populus habet esse habet per consequens regimen in suo esse, sicut omne animal regitur a suo spiritu proprio et anima'.45 Furthermore, for Baldus as for Bartolus the very sign of the sovereignty of the autonomous city-community lies in its non-recognition of a superior.46 There remain two further aspects of the populus as a corporation which should be briefly considered. The populus in so far as it is an abstract corporational entity possesses an attribute which sharply distinguishes it from its individual human members: it is immortal. The city-community is sempiternal precisely because it is universal (that is because it is a corporation): 'Quero numquid civitas durans in novis civibus non naturalibus sed adventiciis dicatur eadem civitas? Respondeo sic . . . quia quod universale est non potest morte perire sicut homo in genere non moritur'.47 Thus the city-community as a corporation is not only a persona universalis; it is as such also a persona perpetual* This perpetuity of the 44 X.l.3.15, n.6, fol. 32v. 45 D. 1.1.9, n.4, fol. 9r. See also id. ad D.1.1.5, n. 33. 46 See, for instance, Baldus ad D.l.1.9, n.7, 18-19; D.1.8.Rubr., fol. 36r; Auth. 'Sedomnino' (ad C.4.12.4); and C.7.46.2. Cp. Bartolus ad D.l.1.9, n.4, fol. 9v (ed. Turin, 1577). 4 7 Baldus De Pace Constantie, 'Imperialis Clementie , fol. lv. On the sempiternity of the city-community see Kantorowicz, The King's Two Bodies, pp. 291-313. On this passage by Baldus Kantorowicz comments (p. 304): 'It is possible that the term 'something universal' fquoddam universale) evoked associations with the likewise immortal Universale of philo sophic speech; but what the term universale really meant in legal language was quite unam biguous: it was synonymous with the technical term universitas deriving from Roman Law' (the text of Baldus in fact contains "quod universale", which is the reading Kantorowicz quotes, p. 300, n.61). See also Gierke, Genossenschaftsrecht, 3:364-65, and 430. 48 See Baldus ad D.l.4.3, fol. 21v: 'Item in privilegiis dicimus quod si sunt concessa personis</page><page sequence="15">THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 23 populus was a common-place among the Commentators, and reveals itself in their common opinion that the people can initiate measures with perpetual effect, as regards for instance legislation and banishment.49 The populus is, however, not only an abstract entity; it is also in one aspect identified with its members. They have to five somewhere; they, in short, require a territory. In a notable passage Baldus makes it clear that the populus is nothing less than a territorial entity; that its territorial aspect forms part of what constitutes the populus: Queritur ulterius numquid intrinseci possint facere statuta contra expulsos? Et videtur quod sic, quia intrinseci faciunt populum, non dispersi et vagi per mundum . . . Die quod si quidem sunt expulsi ex iusta causa valet statutum, quia delictum non debet eis prestare exemptionem ... Et concedo quod iurisdictio remanet penes intrinsecos, quia coheret territorio, et intrin seci possident territorium. Item intrinseci sunt universi, et expulsi sunt singuli.50 By identifying the populus with the intrinseci, Baldus defines it as being com posed of those living within the territory. Furthermore, by characterising the intrinseci as universi, as opposed to the expelled who are merely separate indi viduals (singuli), Baldus seems to consider that the people's living within a terri tory is one of the factors which make it into a corporation — the people is a territorial, corporate entity. The implication is that the people through inhabiting perpetuis ut civitati et collegiis sunt realia, si certis singularibus personis sunt personalia, ut supra (D.1.4.1) . . . sed in beneficiis die aut in beneficio principis et tunc aut conceditur tali persone que non moritur et est reale, quia personale esse non potest cum sit perpetuum, ut (D.50.15.4,3), aut conceditur singulari persone .. .' 49 See, for instance, Baldus ad X.l.2.11, n.12, fol. 26v (ed. Lyons, 1551), and id. ad C.6. 24.1; Bartolus ad D.l.1.9, n.52, fol. 12v (ed. Turin, 1577); Raynerius de Forlf, Rep. ad D.1.1.9, n. 80-81, fol. 23r (in Albericus de Rosciate, Commentariorum Pars Prima super Digesto Veteri, (Lyons, 1545)). There is also in D.5.1.76 a passage which was taken by the Glossators and Commentators to indicate the sempiternity of the people, '... et populum eundem hoc tempore putari qui abhinc centum annis fuissent, cum ex illis nemo nunc viveret'. In this connection see, for instance, Albericus de Rosciate ad D.5.1.76, n.l, fol. 322v (ed. cit.), 'Et multum continue allegatur hec lex quod idem est populus et universitas cuiusque civitatis et loci qui fuit retro mille annis, quia successores représentant eandem universitatem'; and Paulus de Castro, ibid., n.2-3, fol. 138r (ed. Venice, 1593). D.5.1.76 itself has no con nection with corporation-theory. Baldus refers to it on occasion as supporting the idea of the sempiternity of the people: ibid., fol. 221 r, 'Populus tamen nunquam moritur, ut hie dicit textus'. The populus is perpetual retrospectively and prospectively: see id. ad D.3.4.9, fol. 174v, 'Idem populus est, licet nemo vivat ex hits qui retro fuerunt per centum annos, ut infra (D.5.1.76)'; and id. ad X.l.2.6, n.10, fol. 11 r, 'Item nota quod statutum presentium canonicorum potest ligare futuros, quia eadem universitas est sicut populus, ut (D.5.1.76)'. 50 D.l.1.9, n. 34-35 (ed. Venice, 1616). Baldus gives detailed attention to the juristic common-place, iurisdictio coheret territorio. For his attempts to determine the precise sense in which jurisdiction can be said to adhere to a territory see his commentaries on C.9.1.11; D.1.12.1,4, fol. 43r; Feud., 2.54, fol. 79v; and C.7.63.4. See also Bartolus ad D.2.1.1, n.15, fol. 47r (ed. Turin, 1577).

CANNING a defined area becomes a unity which is corporate 5 1 IV In recent years Walter Ullmann has put scholars greatly in his debt by focusing attention on another important aspect of medieval corporation-theory. This is the idea current among the jurists that public bodies, such as the respublica and the city -populus are on the same level as a minor under age.52 One of the major sources for this view is a couple of passages in the Corpus Iuris Civilis itself,5 3 where in addition civitates are placed on a par with madmen and infants because of their inability to express a legally valid will.54 The implications contained in these passages for the government of the community were developed by medieval jurists. A minor in Roman Law requires a tutor to act for him. It thus became current in juristic writings for the community to be identified with a minor and its ruler with a tutor on the grounds that the community does not rule itself but is ruled by others. Indeed, the jurists' equation of the public community with a minor is so universal that Walter Ullmann has been able to say in this connection: Ί have not found one jurist who expressed a different standpoint'.55 If one looks at the sources it is perfectly true that the comparison of the community with a minor is a common theme.56 The jurists were in fact giving precision to govern mental concepts long established in medieval political thought. The jurists applied the concepts of the ruler as tutor, and the community as minor both to the government of cities, and to the relationship between the king and his kingdom. As regards the latter it was a common-place of political ideas from Carolingian times that the monarch was the tutor of the minor, his kingdom, which was committed by God to his care, so that he could act on its behalf.5 7 51 The territorial nature of the people's power and authority is in Baldus' thought a large subject, a detailed treatment of which would be out of place here since that would go beyond his theory of corporations. According to Baldus, territorial conceptions do limit the extent of the people's jurisdiction; but more importantly the possession of a territory forms part of the definition of what the populus is. When a populus is autonomous, Baldus considers it to be nothing less than a territorially sovereign entity. 52 For a discussion of the place of this minority-concept in medieval jurisprudence see Ullmann, 'Juristic Obstacles', pp. 48-64. See also Gierke, Genossenschaftsrecht, 3:397 400,484-85,488. 53 C.2.53.4, and C.l 1.30.3. 54 D.4.6.22,2. 55 'Juristic Obstacles', p. 54. 56 Out of a host of possible examples see, for instance, Accursius ad C.2.53.4, 'Sicut enim minores sunt sub curatoribus, sic et respublica sub administratoribus' col. 406 (ed. Antwerp, 1575); and Jacobus de Arena ad C.2.53.4, fol. llr (ed. Lyons, 1541), 'Sed respublica equi paratur minori, ideo quia per alium regitur sicut minor' (I have emended "regetur" in this edition). 5 7 A connection was made between the tutorial function of the ruler, the inalienability of the</page><page sequence="17">'THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 25 As regards the capacity of the city-community to act and will, the significant implications of the minority thesis are these: that the community, being in the position of a mere minor, lacks a legally valid will; and that its ruler, whether he is styled the rector, the podestà, or by some other term, since he enjoys the position of a tutor, acts on its behalf.58 For these reasons Walter Ullmann main tains that there is a connection between the concept of the respublica as a minor, and the idea that the public body as a corporation is a mere persona ficta: neither the minor nor the fictive person can truly will.59 That is to say, the minority thesis appears to fit in well with the fiction theory. The minority-thesis, as expounded in these terms, rested on a secure foundation just so long as medieval jurists adhered to the fundamental thesis that the com munity, not being fully capable of validly acting and willing in a governmental manner, is therefore subject to a rector appointed by a superior to act on its behalf. There would, however, appear to be an obvious conflict between this minority-thesis and Bartolus' and Baldus' theories of popular sovereignty which involve the capacity of the community to act and will in a legally valid sense. It is true that Bartolus in some passages designated the city-community as a minor,60 and that there is some trace of this idea in Baldus' works. But the point is that rights of the community, and the latter's minority: the ruler as tutor of the community, which was in the position of a minor committed to his care, had to conserve and protect the rights of his ward and could not, therefore, alienate any of its rights. For the historical deve lopment of these concepts see Walter Ullmann, The Carolingian Renaissance and the Idea of Kingship (London, 1969), pp. 177-87; id. 'Schranken der Kdnigsgewalt im Mittelalter', Historisches Jahrbuch 91 (1971), 12-18; id., Ά Note on Inalienability in Gregory VII', Studi Gregoriani 9 (1972), 117-40; id., Medieval Foundations of Renaissance Humanism (London, 1977), pp. 22, 36, and 109; and Hartmut Hoffmann, 'Die Unveràusserlichkeit der Kronrechte im Mittelalter', Deutsches Archiv fur Erforschung des Mittelalters 20 (1964), 389—474. For an example of a jurist's treatment of this theme see Baldus ad X.2.24.33, fol. 236v, 'Rex debet esse tutor regni, non depopulator, nec dilapidator . . . nota quod periurium non est causa finalis quare revocentur alienata, quia ex natura officii etiam in iuramento non valeret, nam rex debet salutem reipublice tueri (D. 1.15.1)': this is the highly influential decretal, Intellecto, of Honorius III, which concerned as it was with the King of Hungary's oath at his coronation 'iura regni sui et honorem coronae illibata servare' (Friedberg, col. 373), provided a major locus for juristic discussion of the implications of the Kings' oaths of non-alienation at their coronations. For the significance of Intellecto and the commen taries it attracted see Peter N. Riesenberg, Inalienability of Sovereignty in Medieval Political Thought (New York, 1956), pp. 113-44. Clearly in this passage Baldus considers that the nature of the royal office itself, and not the oath at coronation, provides the primary reason why the King has a duty of non-alienation. For further complex discussion of the question of a promise of non-alienation at royal coronations (especially in England) see H.G. Richardson, 'The English Coronation Oath', Speculum 24 (1949), 44-75; Ernst H. Kantorowicz, 'Inaliena bility: a Note on Canonical Practice and the English Coronation Oath in the Thirteenth Century', Speculum 29 (1954), 488-502, and The King's Two Bodies, pp. 347-58. 5 8" See Ullmann, 'luristic Obstacles', p. 55: 'There is indeed general agreement amongst the jurists that the prelate, the rector civitatis, the praeses provinciae, the podestà, and so on, were no more and no less than tutors of the community in their trust'. 59 Ibid., pp. 59-60. 60 See, for instance, his commentary on C.l 1.30.3, n.1-2, fol. 35v (ed. Turin, 1577).</page><page sequence="18">26 J.P. CANNING neither jurist permitted this concept to interfere with his major thesis of the sovereign and self-governing city-community. It seems to me that in the cases of Bartolus and Baldus the comparison of the city-community with a minor was retained because the respublica was identified with a minor in the Corpus Iuris Civilis. For both jurists, however, the likening of the city-community to a minor does not involve the wholesale adoption of the minority-thesis as enunciated by Walter Ullmann. The likening of a city-corporation to a minor makes its most important appea rance in Baldus' works in his commentary on C.2.53.4 itself ('Res publica minorum iure uti solet ideoque auxilium restitutionis implorare potest'). The context of his remarks is the equation of the public body (respublica) with a minor, and its consequent enjoyment of restitutio in integrum, the minor's legal remedy.61 Baldus is here employing minority-concepts expressly within the context of the city as a corporation. He rejects the opinion of Jacobus Butrigarius that the large corporation has the status of a minor and is restituted, whereas the small corpo ration (including the small city) is not in this position: Distinctio inter parvam civitatem et magnam universitatem non probatur lege nec ratione, quia sive parva sive magna non est ibi reperire verum consensum, nec veram negligentiam, sed fictam, cum multi sint in universi tate, qui non possunt vere consentire, et multi sint ibi pupilli et minores, quorum favore universitas civitatis, castri, vel ville meretur beneficium restitutionis, quia sunt ex eodem corpore ipsius universitatis, et ita teneo.62 Baldus thus maintains that a city-corporation of any size is in the position of a minor on the grounds that it cannot give true consent, only fictive, because many of its members cannot truly consent, an argument which touches the fundamental reasons for the disabilities and privileges of the minor: his inability to express legally effective consent. Baldus may very well be adopting here a concept of the corporation as a fictive person: the factor common to both the fictive person and the minor - their inability truly to give valid consent — might render this interpre tation attractive. And it is in this sense that Walter Ullmann understands this passage.63 This is, however, the only passage, as far as I know, in which Baldus 61 He here sums up the content of C.2.53.4 thus: 'Respublica equiparatur minori, et ideo habet beneficium restitutionis in integrum. h.d.\ 62 The [Lyons, 1498], edition contains 'qui non possmr vere consentire, et multi sunt ibi pupilli . . — my emendation appears to make better sense. The discussion of the view of Jacobus Butrigarius shortly precedes this passage. Cp. Baldus ad D.4.6.8, fol. 204v: 'Nota argumentant quelibet civitas, castrum, vel villa potest in integrum restitui adversus prescrip tionem, quia si hoc conceditur legato eius, ergo multo fortius sibi . .. Communiter nos tene mus, quod universitates fungantar tare minoris et possint restitui... Et est ratio quia semper sunt sub protectione et gubematione administratorum, et ideo equiparantur ecclesiis et minoribus'. I have adopted 'fungantar tare' as in the Venice, 1616, ed. (cp. 'f/ngantar tare' in the [Lyons], 1498, ed.). 63 'Juristic Obstacles', pp. 59-60.</page><page sequence="19">'THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 27 makes this connection. Baldus' remarks here would not, however, seem to affect his theory of popular sovereignty. It is difficult to see how they could apply to an autonomous citizen-body which governs itself by its own consent. He clearly has in mind here a city-corporation in its widest sense as including all those who do not have the capacity for a legally valid consent.64 We enter here an ill-defined area in Baldus' thought, that is to say, the relationship between the citizen-body, meaning those who in one way or another participate in government, and the rest of the city's inhabitants. The crucial point is that in the face of everything which Baldus has to say elsewhere about the sovereign powers of the people, this passage cannot be seen to undermine his contention that the autonomous populus can govern itself through the exercise of its own consent. It now remains only to examine very briefly Bartolus' and Baldus' views of the structure of government of that self-governing corporation, the sovereign city community: that is to say how it acts and wills through the medium of its mem bers. In the works of both jurists their theories of the structure of popular govern ment are directly opposed to those adumbrated by the fiction theory, and the minority-thesis. Whereas the fiction theory and the minority-thesis envisage a rector appointed by an external superior to rule the city-community which cannot rule itself, Bartolus and Baldus maintain that the city-community possesses original governmental power, and exercises this through the medium of, on the one hand, general assemblies and councils representative of the people, and, on the other, officers elected by the people and accountable to it. Both jurists seek to develop a theory to account for the contemporary reality of self-governing Italian cities. Bartolus produced for the structure of popular government a model which is extremely well-known:65 the general assembly of the people elects the council which acts as the governing body of the city, and elects the city's officers. This council is thus an elected, representative body; and Bartolus memorably expresses this representative character of the council in the famous words: 'Consilium représentât mentem populi'.66 In contrast Baldus' 64 Cp. Baldus ad D.46.8.9, fol. 44v, 'Differt collegium ab universitate alicuius loci, quia in collegio omnes habent intellectum, sed in universitate civitatis vel ville non' (intellectus is a prerequisite for the capacity to give consent); and id. ad Durandi speculum iuris, 1.3.1, p. 194 (ed. Frankfurt, 1592), 'Ille qui per se non potest consentire, ut civitas, non potest facere procuratorem ad iudicia; secus in collegio vel corpore, ubi singuli habent immediatum consensum per seipsos (D.3.3.8,2)'. 65 The best modern discussion is in Ullmann, 'De Bartoli sententia' (See above, n.4), pp. 716-23. 66 D.1.3.32, n.10, fol. 17v (ed. Turin, 1577). See also id. ad C.10.32.2, n.8, p. 37 (ed. Basel, 1588), 'Item nota quod de iure communi ad consilium civitatis spectat facere electiones</page><page sequence="20">28 J.P. CANNING treatment of the structure of popular government is in some respects tantalizingly incomplete and jejune, and in others most profound and illuminating. Unlike Bartolus, Baldus does not present a model, but rather gives lavish attention to certain crucial points, while totally ignoring others or treating them inadequately. The unevenness of his discussion could give rise to the impression that it is, through its lack of comprehensiveness, inferior to that of Bartolus. This view may well be justified; but the explanation may be that Baldus was more sensitive to the variety of political forms in Italy, and was unwilling to suggest any detailed model of popular government which must to some degree be removed from the compli cations of reality ,6 7 It is quite possible that Baldus was happy to lay down certain basic principles and to leave to each city the constitutional arrangements which it might happen to develop. Certainly both jurists write in general terms: it is only on occasion that they refer to the constitutions of particular cities. As regards the general assembly and representative councils Baldus has little that is original to contribute, but tends to follow Bartolus' ideas. In his sketch of legislative procedure Baldus treats both the city-community as a whole, and the council as corporations.6 8 When the individual members are brought into congre gation, the corporation assumes that corporeal form which, as we have seen, is necessary if it is to act and will.69 Furthermore voting in the general assembly and councils is by numerical majority which is for Baldus, as for the other Commenta tors, the normal means of expressing the will of a corporation, for by this method the unitary will of the corporation as a whole can be extracted from the multipli city of individual views and wishes.70 officialium, et syndicorum, facit infra (C. 10.32.30); et sic non erit opus arenga vel adunantia generali. Arenga tamen, seu parlamentum illud, ubi non est aliquis superior, habet ab initio consilium eligere, ut (D.1.2.2) circa prin.. Istud consilium sic electum postea représentât totum populum, ut not. supra (C.8.52.Rubr.)'. 67 Bartolus, however, in his tract De regimine civitatis does go some way further in treating the different forms of government existing in Italy in that he distinguishes between a populus 'in primo gradu magnitudinis' which should be governed by the multitude, a populus maior 'in secundo gradu magnitudinis' which should be ruled by the few, and one 'in tertio gradu magnitudinis' for which monarchy is most suitable (nn. 15-24, fol. 156v-157r, ed. Turin, 1577). These are of course very broad divisions, and the point remains that Bartolus, in so far as he is concerned with popular government in this tract, is elaborating his model for general application. 68 Inst., 1.2,1, n.12-16, fol. 3v (ed. Venice, 1615). For further evidence that Baldus is saying nothing new here concerning the forma statuendi cp. Raynerius de Forli, Rep. ad D. 1.1.9, n.37-38, fol. 19v (ed. cit.), where he describes more clearly what is substantially the same procedure. 69 See above, p. 14. 70 See, for instance, Baldus ad D.8.3.11, fol. 245v, 'In eo quod competit pluribus ut universis statur maiori parti'; and id. ad C.10.32.45, 'Die quod ea que competunt alicui corpori facta a maiori parte existentium de corpore videntur esse facta ab ipso corpore'. See Gierke, Genossenschaftsrecht, 3:392-94, and 466-76, for an extensive treatment of the views of the Commentators on majority-voting. In his commentary on Inst., 1.2,1, n.15, fol. 3v (ed.</page><page sequence="21">'THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 29 Baldus makes a major contribution, however, in his extensive treatment of the officers of the people: the men who give executive, administrative, and judicial expression to the people's jurisdiction. The strength of Baldus' discussion lies in his consideration of those general principles which apply to every major office. The nomenclatures employed reflect a wide range of terms: magistrates, decurio, potestas, preses, consul, antianus, and prior. Behind the variety of different kinds of office lies the common denominator of the relationship between every officer and the people. Baldus' fundamental theme is simple: ultimate power lies with the people whose will its officers put into practice. The people is the source of its officers' power, and concedes to them just as much power, and tenure of office as it wishes.71 Baldus' officers are representatives who receive their authority from the people to act on its behalf.72 This is the conception of representation essential to the theme of popular sovereignty. cit.) Baldus requires for legislation the presence of two-thirds of the members of the corpo ration (whether the general assembly or the council), and considers a simple numerical majority of those present to be sufficient for expressing the will of the whole corporation: 'illud quod obtinebitur per maiorem partem dictarum duarum partium erit statutum'. This was the general doctrine of the Commentators: see, for instance, Raynerius de Forlî, loc. cit., and Albericus de Rosciate ad D.l.3.32, n.122, fol. 42r (ed. Lyons, 1545), 'actus universitatis debet fieri a maiori parte presentium ... et debent consentire ut corpus non ut singuli... et sic patet quod in unoquoque actu requiritur consensus maioris partis et quod consentiant ut corpus vel populus non ut singuli'. 71 See, for instance, Baldus, Cons., 1.40, fol. 17r, 'Captura fuit possibilis de iure, quia ipsi antiani habent illam iurisdictionem, quam dat eis consuetudo . . . Minime dubitandum est, quod ea iurisdictione uti possunt, quoniam ex quo hoc concessum est eis nedum per taciturn consensum populi, sed per expressum statutum, tali iurisdictione et eo imperio uti possunt presertim cum carceratio sit executiva iurisdictionis'; and id. ad X.l.36.3, n.2, fol. 125r, 'Quid de potestate alicuius terre? Respon. hoc non potest, nisi hoc sit ei concessum aconsue tudine, vel a lege municipali, quia in re publica nullus potest, nisi quatenus est ei concessum (D.3.4.3 ; et D.43.24.3,4)'; on the question of tenure see id. ad C.6.21.15; id., Lectura antiqua ad D.12.1.33, fol. 21v;andid. adC.9.26.1. 72 This emerges clearly in his treatment of the legal status of the statute of the antiani. Are they merely ius pretorium (as might be suggested by the equation of the antiani with certain Roman magistrates such as the curule aediles - an idea to be found in Bartolus ad D.45.1.5, n.4, fol. lOr, ed. Turin, 1577), or do they enjoy the same status as legal enactments of the people itself: are they, in short, ius civile? Baldus maintains that, because the antiani represent the people, their statutes are, indeed, ius civile: 'Sed pone anciani faciunt statutum, an istud est ius pretorium vel civile? . . . Mihi videtur quod sit ius civile, quia non habent potestatem hanc, quia magistratum gerunt, sed quia per collegium ipsorum representatur totus populus; sed ediles sub nomine magistratus sortiti erant auctoritatem statuendi' (ad D.l.1.9, n.41-42, ed. Venice, 1616). Baldus takes this view, because he has a clear understanding that in making statutes the antiani act for the people: that is to say, their statutes embody the will of the people, and, therefore, obtain their legal force from this, and not from the fact that they are made by magistrates. See also id., De Pace Constantie, "Damna", fol. 92r, 'Item et si potestates, consiliarii, et antiani hoc faciant, tota universitas fecisse videtur' (cp. Albericus de Rosciate ad D.l.3.32, n.46, fol. 37v, ed. cit.: 'quod faciunt decuriones vel magistratus in officio eis commisso populus ipse facere videtur"); and Baldus ad C.8.52.Rubr., and X.2.27.26, n.14, fol. 346r(ed. Lyons, 1551).</page><page sequence="22">30 J.P. CANNING It is only possible here briefly to illustrate Baldus' conception of the relation ship between the people, and its officers. In order to stress that the people is the ultimate possessor of that jurisdiction which its representative officers exercise for it, Baldus borrows from the language of the theocratic system, because the concepts for expressing supreme power had in medieval juristic thought been elaborated in theocratic terms. Thus he describes the populus as being the superior of its officers who are thus its inferiores.73 He also finds other terms useful to express the relationship: the city-community is the dominus of its rector who is in consequence accountable to the community being its agent.74 These conceptions of the rôle of the rector clearly run counter to both the fiction theory and the minority-thesis. The latter view is made clear by Baldus, when he maintains that the officers of a city-community are comparable to tutors, because they are accountable to the community for the way in which they exercise their office ?s There is no suggestion here that the community is in the position of a minor; rather it is in that of the authority appointing the tutor. The officer's tutorial function expresses the rôle of protection and responsibility. There is here involved a different usage of the tutorial concept from that contained in the minority-thesis. Furthermore whereas Innocent IV in his commentary on X.l .2.8 had maintained that the rectors of a corporation, and not the corporation, possess jurisdiction, Baldus in his commentary on the same passage shows that he parts company with Innocent by insisting that the people retains potentially (in habitu) that jurisdiction, which it confers on its officer, who puts its jurisdic tion into action.76 This definition ingeniously explains how the officer exercises See Cons., 2.335, fol. 88v, 'Potestas concessa per statuta generalia dominis prioribus et camerariis non extendit se ad conceptionem vel derogationem generaliter statutorum; oportet enim hoc nominatim mandari . . . Statutum populi maius estquam statutum decurionum;et eius est corrigere et derogare, cuius est condere, non inférions, quia inferior non potest tollere legem superioris'. 74 Baldus ad D.l.16.4,2, fol. 50v, 'Sicut in civilibus est dare generalem actionem domino contra suum gestorem, sic et reipublice contra suum rectorem; et sicut ex probatis super generali actione sequitur specialis condemnatio, ita et super inquisitione generali. Sed adverte rector civitatis tenetur generali iudicio domino suo, id est universitati seu civitati, particulari bus autem, quos lesit, tenetur singulari iudicio'. 75 X.2.19.11, n.58, fol. 192v, 'Et nota quod etiam sine accusatore fiunt contra rectores terrarum inquisitiones générales. Nam sicut libellus generalis procedit contra tutorem, et curatorem, ita contra magistratum, qui tenetur rei publice reddere rationem generalem de omnibus gestis tempore sui officii'. The text of the Lyons, 1521, edition contains 'tenetur ei publice', which I have emended. 76 See Innocent, n.3, fol. 3r (ed. Frankfurt, 1570), 'Et est notandum quod rectores assumpti ab universitatibus habent iurisdictionem, et non ipse universitates. Aliqui tamen dicunt quod ipse universitates deficientibus rectoribus possunt exercere iurisdictionem sicut rectores, quod non credo'; and Baldus, n.10, fol. 16r, 'Habet igitur populus iurisdictionem habitu in confe rendo, sed non in exercendo per se. At si populus est suorum civium princeps et dominus potest sibi potestatem eligere. Si autem alius ei principatur, immediate talis electio indiget confirmatione. Illud certum est quod iurisdictio nisi prius habeatur in habitu, id est in virtute, non potest excitari ad actum suum, ut notât Ioannes Monachusin(Sext., 1.3.11)'. Cp. Johannes</page><page sequence="23">'THE CORPORATION IN THE THOUGHT OF THE ITALIAN JURISTS' 31 the jurisdiction of the people which ultimately as the source of that jurisdiction continues to retain it. Clearly this is a view incompatible with the fiction theory, and the minority-thesis. This creative usage of the philosophical concepts of habitus, potentia, and actus, which is found elsewhere in this connection in Baldus' works,77 reveals his great originality. VI Clearly the corporation-theories of the medieval Italian jurists occupy a unique and important position in the history of political thought. The ideas of Baldus have here been particularly stressed, and surely with justification, because, as we have seen, he achieved something very important: he combined the ultimately Aristotelian conception of the people composed of natural, political men, with juristic corporational concepts, thus adding juristic refinement to the idea of the people as a political entity. The result was that Baldus produced a conception of the city-populus that had not been enunciated before, namely that it is a collection of natural, political men (citizens) into a unitary entity which is an abstract and immortal legal person with a substratum of physical members, and which is both self-governing and territorial. J.P. Canning UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF NORTH WALES, BANGOR Monachus ad Sext., 1.3.11, η.12-13, fol. 36r (ed. Paris, 1535): 'Iurisditio est iudicis dandi licentia (D.2.1.3), unde iurisditio a ius et ditio, id est potestas derivator. Et ideo dato iudice nata est iurisditio, id est potestas iuris dicendi (D.39.5.10) in fine. Et potestas prius nascitur quam excitetor ad actum ... Et notandum est quod iurisditio ut est in termino a quo et in dante est iudicis dandi potestas. Sed prout est in termino ad quern, id est in dato iudice, est iuris dicendi potestas que postmodum reducitor ad actum et exercitium'. Baldus clearly goes beyond these ideas of Johannes Monachus. 77 See Feud., 2.54, fol. 79v, 'In magistrate (iurisdictio) est tanquam in subiecto animato sine quo per se iurisdictio nihil agit, ut (D.1.2.2,13). Et sicut ecclesia dicitor curata habitu et actu, ita iurisdictio quandoque est in habitu, quandoque in actu. Nam in habitu est per potentiam, in actu per exercitium, dixi (D.l.12.1) per Bartolum (D.2.1.1). Est autem iurisdictio prout est in sua substantia, que habitus vocator, plectendi, decernendi, et ius dicendi potestas iure publico propter bonum publicum principaliter et secundario propter utilitatem privatorum introducta. Sed prout inest ipsi magistratoi est regentis officium magistrates, quod in habitu actuque consistit iuxta no. per modernos in (D.2.1.1 et 3)'. Cp. Bartolus ad D.2.1.1, n.9, fol. 46v (ed. Turin, 1577): 'potest considerari officium prout coheret persone, et tunc si quidem acciperetur officium pro totali administratione, differt officium a iurisdictione, quia iurisdictio est ius et potestas etc., ut supra dixi, officium est exercitium illius iurisdictionis, ut (D.50.8.5,1)'. See also Baldus ad C.7.62.6: 'Dicet aliquis nonne in primo casu lex est superior quocunque magistrate. Respondeo sic, tamen non confirmât ut superior, sed tanquam con currens in actu, et ideo lex et magistrates auctoritate legis faciens sunt unum et idem sicut potentia in actu deducta efficitur unum et idem cum actu'. The concepts in question are, of course, the common-coin of Scholastic philosophy. See, for instance, Thomas Aquinas' lengthy discussion of habitus in S.T., la 2ae.49.1-4 where the following statement occurs (art. 3): 'Dicendum quod habitus est actus quidam, inquantum est qualitas; et secundum hoc</page><page sequence="24">32 J.P.
