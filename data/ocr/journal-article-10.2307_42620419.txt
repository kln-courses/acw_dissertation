<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Plaquettes of "Moderno" and His Followers DOUGLAS LEWIS National Gallery of Art , Washington Moderno is widely regarded as the most accomplished artist of Italian Renaissance plaquettes, but his oeuvre is almost as ill-defined as his personality. The historical iden- tity hidden behind his "trade" name has long been a matter of dispute, and in the traditional literature he was not suc- cessfully identified with any town or region, beyond being generally acknowledged as north Italian. Notwithstanding this uncertainty about his artistic milieu , his dozen signed plaquettes1 manifest such technical virtuosity and such aes- thetic appeal as to have encouraged massive accretions to his putative list of works. Emile Molinier in 1886 inaugu- rated the systematic study of Moderno's plaquettes (and the whole field), assigning sixty designs to the artist, who he thought likely to be Venetian;2 Ernst Bange in 1922 enlarged his oeuvre to seventy-three works, with twenty-nine more(!) given to Moderno s immediate following, circle, or influ- ence, all centered on Padua.3 But Rognini's researches of x9754 now convincingly support Bode s 1904 identification5 of Moderno as Galeazzo Mondella (1467-1528), a prominent goldsmith and guild master of Verona; and in an earlier study I discussed his development as a medalist at the nearby court of Mantua.6 An attentive scrutiny of the medals and plaquettes attributed to him can now be based on a clearer understanding of his historical context, including the influ- ence of Mantegna and other artists in his native Veneto, as well as of predecessors and colleagues in Lombardy and Emilia, especially "Antico" (c. 1460-1528), whose associate he probably was, and whose "trade" name almost certainly influenced his own. The first result of such a fresh look at Moderno's corpus of plaquettes is presented here. Continu- ing research will certainly give rise to revisions: at the moment his personal authorship of some forty-five designs seems plausible (see Appendix). This paper will review Moderno's plaquettes in roughly chronological sequence, noting especially formal and iconographie traits among his signed or undoubted works that provide a basis for the identification of others. Our understanding of the chronology of Mondella/ Moderno is still scanty. We know that Mondella was born in 1467 into an active family of goldsmiths, who were among the minor nobility of Verona:7 Vasari tells us (revealingly) that Galeazzo was best remembered as a graphic artist and gem engraver.8 He appears in records of the Verona gold- smiths' guild in 1485 (at the age of eighteen), and after a hiatus was its president for two incumbencies, in 1496-1497 and again in 1506-1507; during the latter tenure he spent at least two weeks in Venice. Apart from these terms in office he was evidently away from Verona for considerable periods, but his presence there is documented also in 1502, 1516, 1517, and 1527. His son Gian Battista was born out 105</page><page sequence="2">of wedlock to his housekeeper in 1506; they were the ben- eficiaries of his will, made on 5 May 1528. Galeazzo's brother and partner Girolamo (1464-1512) had close connections with the Este court at Ferrara; Galeazzo himself is recorded as being on friendly terms, among local artists, at least with Gian Antonio Falconetto, Antonio Badile the elder, the miniaturist Liberale da Verona, and the medalist Giovanni Maria Pomedelli. His whereabouts during his substantial absences from Verona are not recorded, save through Va- sarťs report that he made a trip to France (where indeed two drawings, one inscribed with his name, are preserved in the Louvre):9 this journey - if it did take place - might well have been made in connection with the appointment of Galeazzo's pupil in drawing and gem engraving, Matteo del Nassaro, to the royal mint of François I (who acceded to the throne in 1515). 10 For Moderno we have only one plaquette with an in- scribed date, a middle period Sacra Conversazione with the date 1490 inscribed on the back. It will be shown below that one of his images was copied as a figure in an altarpiece in Treviso dated 1487, and a considerable number relate intimately to other dated pictures of the late 1480s and the 1490s. Several of his designs can be associated with the first years of the cinquecento: an inscription on a medal (if its attribution is accepted) would document him in Mantua on 20 November 1504. 11 The masterpiece of his signed pla- quettes directly "quotes" the figure of Laocoön , from the group discovered in Rome in 1506; and several of his com- positions were reproduced in marble on the Porta della Rana of Como Cathedral in 1507. 12 His most popular late work is a Pietà of which an example in the cathedral at Mantua is inscribed 1513 (significantly, it exists as well in two hard- stone carvings, plausibly by the artist and his pupil Matteo del Nassaro, whom Moderno may have accompanied or joined in France at about this time). After the latter date we have no evidence of Moderno's further activity as a maker of plaquettes. With the restoration of Venetian rule to Verona in 1517, following the Wars of the League of Cambrai, Galeazzo was elected "at the age of fifty" to the reinstated Consiglio Co- munale,13 and may (if he was not in France) have turned more to civic affairs in his later years. The only subsequent documents for his life in Verona are a will he witnessed in 1527, and his own, made in 1528. 14 We must turn for further clues to his works themselves, beginning at the period of his youthful enrollment in the Veronese guild in 1485. I believe it is now possible to confirm Molinier's hy- pothesis that Moderno's "première manière" is to be rec- ognized in his rare Large Saint Sebastian plaquette (fig. 1) - if not, perhaps, to follow him in imputing to it "un charactère assez archaïque."15 The young Moderno would certainly have chafed at the suggestion, for the image is a self-conscious compendium of distinguished recent sources, albeit naively composed. The head, the torso, and drapery of the saint, the rope around his feet, and the column with its necking- band and capital are all reproduced precisely from Man- tegna's Small Saint Sebastian in Vienna: a panel apparently painted for a Veronese patron at the moment of the artist s consignment of the San Zeno altarpiece to that city (before his transferrai to Mantua in 1459), since it includes not only a distant view of Verona but also a direct quotation from the Romanesque portal of San Zeno itself.10 Moderno's "Ve- ronese" borrowings from Mantegna along the central axis of the plaquette are encompassed by an archway in per- Fig. 1.

Kress Collection 106</page><page sequence="3">spective (seen off-center from the right), enframing the par- tially visible figure of an archer aiming his bow at the saint; on one side a broken column stands forward of the arcuated pier, and from it hangs a cartella with the artist's initial. All these details save the signature are replicated (somewhat loosely) from Vincenzo Foppa's newly painted Saint Se- bastian of 1485, now in the Brera:17 that Moderno s source for these components was a very recent fresco in the sacristy of a Milanese church, which he perhaps knew only through rough drawings or a hasty visit, may explain the grating awkwardness of his rendering of these motifs. He substi- tuted for the archers in Foppa's fresco a single executioner, drawn either from the one on the left of an altarpiece also by Foppa for the Milanese church of San Sebastiano, or even from a "proto-plaquette" perhaps by Donatello;18 this stock figure also has interesting parallels in Germany.19 Moderno filled the frieze band of his archway with repetitive classicizing ornament, and the sky seen through it with idiosyncratic small clouds - motifs so specific as to leave no doubt that he took them directly from a great altarpiece of Saint Jerome , painted by Ercole de' Roberti in the 1470s in Ferrara.20 The element that ties Moderno s first plaquette securely to Verona is that of the saint's arms crossed above his head and tied to the column behind, which is isolated against a cloud-strewn sky. The motif appears in this form in a paint- ing of Saint Sebastian by Francesco Bonsignori of Verona, signed and dated 14[8]5, now in Berlin.21 It was replicated within the next decade or so by the same artist, on a sub- sidiary figure in an altarpiece for the chapel of San Biagio in the church of Santi Nazaro e Celso in Verona;22 it was monumentalized again, in the same chapel and immediately alongside, in the great fresco of Saint Sebastian by Barto- lomeo Montagna, painted in 1504-1507. 23 It was thus some- thing of a Veronese speciality; and a proof that the young Moderno had studied the Bonsignori prototype is afforded by his expressive combination of its upraised arms with Mantegna's downturned head, and the angled projection of its flexed leg with the powerful diagonal of Mantegna's load- bearing one. An indication of Moderno's talent for figurai composition, relative to that of his contemporaries, is provided by a com- parison of this very plaquette - which, with respect to its sources and authorship, we may confidently place around 1485 in Verona- with the variants of a rare engraving of the same subject by Nicoletto da Modena. Surprisingly, this relationship is unstudied, though it is central to the un- derstanding of both the plaquette and the prints. Mark Zucker has recently characterized Nicoletto in terms that present him not only as a contemporary, but also as so close a cultural counterpart as to make his description almost equally applicable to Moderno. Nicoletto was born in Modena, was . . . active at Ferrara in the 1480s, worked in Padua in 1506, and was present in Rome in 1507. . . . [H]e may have been in Milan at some early stage of his career, [and] traveled to Venice once or twice. . . . Still at a fairly early point, Nicoletto acquired a knowledge of northern European engravings. . . . From the very start, the heritage of Mantegna had imbued Nicoletto's art with the spirit of antiquity, and . . . direct confrontation with the classical world . . . was an experience never to be forgotten. [I]n no case did his models ever dominate him or turn him into a mere fol- lower. His activity spans a period of some 20-25 years, and the evolution of his style and technique . . . reflects the overall development of Italian [art].24 Such similarities of background, experience, and taste are reflected in repeated parallels between Nicoletto's and Moderno's works: again surprisingly, Moderno s are in each instance the prototypes for Nicoletto's. A diagnostic example is afforded by a comparison of Nicoletto's similar print to Moderno's Large Saint Sebastian. The first state of the engraving shows a figure quoted verbatim from Bonsignori's painting apparently of 1485 - only the saint's gaze is shifted downward.25 The second version of the print radically changes the proportions of the composition, and above all the atti- tude of the saintly figure, precisely to replicate Moderno s early plaquette.26 Nicoletto's revised Saint Sebastian of c. 1515 or later is clear evidence of Moderno's enduring appeal:27 though softened, elaborated, and sweetened, it sensitively recasts in High Renaissance idiom the angular quattrocento expressiveness of Moderno's powerful Mantegnesque prototype. A parallel work that is virtually a pendant to Moderno's first Sebastian plaquette is a large Crucifixion (fig. 2), 28 that is among the most frequently encountered of his designs. None of its many examples bears an inscription, but it is closely tied by composition and details to several signed or unquestioned works. Most of these connections will be no- ticed below, as we encounter cognate motifs in subsequent works; with the Large Sebastian it shares its heavy fillet rim, its clinging, minutely ridged draperies, and the angular torsion of its northern-looking figures. Indeed Pope-Hennessy suggested that "the two thieves seem to depend from a German engraved source," and Wixom identified such a candidate in a Deposition by the Master with the Bande- roles, a Netherlandish artist of the third quarter of the fifteenth century.29 But the whole composition of Moderno s Crucifixion derives from a celebrated source much closer lewis 107</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2. Crucifixion , later 1480s, bronze, 12.8 x 9.1 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Widener Collection to home, Ercole de' Robertťs fresco of the same subject (now destroyed) painted in c. 1482-1486 for the Garganelli chapel at San Petronio in Bologna. Various descriptions - including an enthusiastic encomium by Vasari30 - as well as drawings, fragments, and partial painted copies of the fresco survive,31 but for our purposes the most revealing is a chalk study by Amico Aspertini, of perhaps c. 1510, based closely on Robertťs design.32 It shares with Moderno's plaquette the melée of figures in the foreground (including a small nude child), contrasting with the dramatic silhouettes of the three figures on their crosses in an upper register, empty save for the sponge raised aloft, with Longinus' and other lances, pikes, and halberds.33 Moderno's rather tentative adaptation of this famous design suffers badly from crowding in the foreground and from an awkward discrepancy of scale between the larger surrounding figures and the tiny Christ; but these weaknesses conveniently reveal his composition to be an experimental early effort, probably very close in date to Robertťs completion of the San Petronio fresco in the middle 1480s. Moderno must have been influenced in this early Cru- cifixion not only by Emilian painting and northern prints (we know that engravings by the Master with the Bande- roles, for example, were available in Bologna between 1462 and 1478), 34 but also by at least one image from his native Veneto, a small panel painting of the Crucifixion by Antonio Vivarini, perhaps of c. 1440, now in Ravenna.35 Apart from the absence of the two thieves, this work is an even closer prototype: it is similarly dense and compact, with Longinus' and the centurion's horses framing the center with only their heads and necks visible; the wailing Magdalene em- braces the foot of the Cross, Saint John is isolated with his hands clasped in grief, and the Virgin, about to swoon, is surrounded by the pious women at the lower left; a soldier holding a large shield is seen from the back on the lower right. Moderno's Virgin collapsed in a faint, finally, appears to have been based on a prototype similar to one used by an illuminator of a missal for Matthias Corvinus in the Vat- ican Library;36 two plausible sources are the similar groups on the left of a panel in Mantua of Christ Carrying the Cross , by Moderno's Veronese compatriot Francesco Bon- signori, and in a Deposition in Pavia from the school of Foppa.37 An often noticed instance of self-quotation occurs in an- other Moderno plaquette closely related to the Crucifixion in subject, style, and handling. This is an intermediate- sized Resurrection (fig. 19), 38 forming part of an eventual series of four scenes from the life of Christ (discussed below), but which may have been designed earlier than its pendants. Elements of the composition that support an early dating are all paralleled in the Crucifixion : a somewhat discordant separation into two registers, with a concentration on tensely angular silhouette in the upper; in the lower, tightly grouped figures of upward-gazing soldiers holding large shields dec- orated all'antica (one of whom is the figure essentially copied from the Crucifixion ); and - once more - direct depen- dence on a prototype by Ercole de' Roberti. The idiosyn- cratic form of the dozing guard in the left foreground exactly replicates a grisaille figure of the pensive King David, in fictive relief, in the background of Roberti's great altarpiece of c. 1475 for San Lazzaro in Ferrara.39 The unstable rushing diagonal of Moderno's composition, together with its dy- namic angularity of figure type, as well as the explicit bor- rowing from Roberti (that we saw as well in the early Saint Sebastian ), all suggest the artist's close awareness of Ferrara. As noted above, Galeazzo Mondella' s brother Girolamo was the subject of laudatory sonnets by a humanist member of that court,40 and such learned contacts might well explain 108</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3. Hercules Seizing the Cattle of Geryon , c. 1487?, bronze, 7.1 X 5.4 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Samuel H. Kress Collection the presence here of one of Moderno's rare examples of iconographie arcana: his central soldier's shield is decorated with a crayfish, whose unexpected backward movements - like the crab's - were construed by Renaissance emble- matists to suggest Christ's unimaginable turning back, on both time and death, in the Resurrection.41 Francesco Rossi has suggested that Moderno s twice-used soldier seen from the rear, in the Crucifixion and Resur- rection plaquettes, might reflect such a prototype as the figure of Neptune in Mantegna's engraved Battle of the Sea Gods (although in fact Moderno had a much more local and direct source for the motif, in a manuscript illumination by Liberale da Verona).42 In the widest sense, Moderno s con- tinuing dependence in these early works upon Mantegna, as the most influential Venetan artist of the period of his youth, is certainly credible; but his direct recourse in these examples to Emilian and especially Ferrarese sources, as well as to Veronese and Mantegnesque ones, suggests the strong likelihood of a sojourn at Ferrara. If we were to place such a hypothetical journey in i486 or shortly afterward, Moderno might well have been able to meet Ercole de' Roberti himself and thus have had direct knowledge of the immediately preceding Crucifixion fresco in Bologna. (A point that makes this especially likely is Roberti's inclusion of the unusual small children in his preparatory drawing, but his apparent omission of them from the finished paint- ing.)43 Middeldorf noted a certain formal relationship be- tween Moderno s Resurrection plaquette and a painting attributed to Leonardo in Berlin,44 but in my view the dis- tant similarities in composition and pose of the central figure bespeak once more - exactly as in the case of Nicole tto da Modena' s updated "Renaissancizing" of the Saint Sebastian plaquette - the transformation of an impressive but still sol- idly quattrocento design of Moderno s by an interested (and in this case, a particularly accomplished) artist of the early cinquecento. In my study of medallic designs attributable to Moderno, I explored his relationships in the 1480s and 1490s with medalists at the court of Mantua, particularly Antico.45 One relief that can be attributed to Moderno through connec- tions with his signed works is an isolated medallic tondo (that is a round uniface "plaquette,'' but composed on an exergue and inscribed like a medal) of a Cavalry Charge labeled dvbia fortvna; it displays an intimate awareness of Mantuan medals by Antico and Gianfrancesco Ruberti.46 As with parallel designs by those contemporaries, it angles its progression of rapidly moving forms in a sequence of dramatic diagonals suggesting a sarcophagus frieze; in this sense it recalls the insistent (though less artfully handled) sharp diagonals of Moderno's Resurrection plaquette (fig. 19). 47 The differences between these works, however, are more revealing than their similarities: the spare angu- larity of the rectangular design is replaced in the tondo by an elaborated rhythmic complexity, achieving from a com- pacted multitude of forms a balanced harmony of effect. If the Cavalry Charge were to be accepted as Moderno's, it would demonstrate that his awareness of Mantuan art not only added a new component to his training, but offered him a means of outgrowing his earlier mode of provincially exaggerated and sometimes northern-inspired pathos, in favor of a controlled late quattrocento classicism that became an extended prelude to a majestically resolved late style, inspired by the High Renaissance in Rome. The modest relief that documents Moderno's first ab- sorption of Mantuan art is another "occasional'' plaquette, a medallic design reissued in uniface form. This is a Roman Triumph , made as the reverse of a medal for Agostino Maz- zanti of Verona: it is datable to the middle 1480s by its direct reliance on Ruberti's accession medal for Francesco II Gon- zaga of 1484, and (in my view) is guaranteed to Moderno by being nearly identical to his later Senatorial Triumph , which is signed, and has a closely cognate design. I have previously analyzed both these medallic Triumphs in de- tail;48 for our present purposes they provide crucial testi- mony to Moderno's immersion in the up-to-date world of Mantegna's Mantuan classicism, above all focusing on that master's great cycle of the Triumphs of Caesar. From these models come the gravely measured cadences of Moderno's tondo reliefs, especially the decorated patterning of their lewis 109</page><page sequence="6">trophies, eagles, and standards, moving as isolated vertical ornaments across an open ground.49 Probably the best-known works in Moderno s oeuvre are four signed reliefs of the Labors of Hercules.50 These hand- some though still slightly tentative designs are very fre- quently encountered, and are all signed. Universally rec- ognized as early works, they nevertheless avoid obvious reliances on recent north Italian paintings, sculptures, or prints. Pietro Cannata in 1981 noticed that the series' second scene, Cacus Stealing the Cattle from Hercules (fig. 4), is based closely enough on the Aeneid as to presuppose a recourse to Virgil's text;51 the conclusion can be drawn (on the basis of my study of Moderno s connections with Man- tuan medalists) that he was moved to do so in Virgil's native town of Mantua itself. Francesco Rossi in 1984 observed that the four-part Hercules series shows Moderno moving decisively away from the provincial north Italian eclecticism of his previous designs, toward an increasingly confident style of classically ponderated figure types, in antique set- tings of archaeologizing exactitude.52 We may thus under- stand the ruined Roman amphitheater in the third scene of the series - that of Hercules Wrestling with a Monster , styl- istically the most advanced of these images (fig. 5) - as rep- resenting the arena of Moderno s native Verona; the (bro- ken, but possibly once doubled) archway standing at right angles across an arcaded thoroughfare, in the initial Gery on scene (fig. 3), as a reminiscence of Verona's "Porta Borsari"; and the columned arcade in the final scene of Hercules Triumphant (fig. 6), so much improved over the awkward "pictorial" borrowings of the same image in the early Large Saint Sebastian , as an adaptation from either the "Arco dei Gavi" or the Arch of Jupiter Ammon, both in Verona.53 A particular point is given to these evidences of Moderno s careful study of Veronese antiquities, by Vasari's testimony that Mondella collected the drawings of Gian Antonio Fal- conetto:54 this artist (born c. 1470) and his better known brother Gian Maria Falconetto (1468-1535) were compa- triots and close contemporaries of Mondella/Moderno, and the most accomplished Venetan antiquarians of the pre- Palladian generation;55 not only Palladio but Serlio as well based many published renderings of Veronese and Istrian antiquities on Falconetto drawings.56 William Wixom in 197557 called attention to a recent study by John Spencer of the four signed Hercules plaquettes. Spencer, noting the iconographie anomalies of the third and fourth scenes (Hercules wrestling with an uncanonical cen- taur-monster, and then contemplating a slain human an- tagonist), proposed that all four images, illustrations of the single Labor of Hercules' struggles with Cacus over the Cattle of Geryon, might constitute an integrated allegory Fig. 4. Cacus Stealing the Cattle from Hercules, c. 1487?, bronze, 7.0 x 5.3 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Kaiser Fund of Fortitude.58 In this intriguing interpretation, Hercules' initial theft of the cattle (fig. 3) would represent his seizing the prizes of the lands beyond the west, that is of death, by killing the triple-bodied monster Geryon (a prerequisite event that precedes those shown in this series); his leading the beasts through a formal analogue of a Roman street in Verona would symbolize his "domestication" of these prizes, by returning them to the classical heartland of the central Mediterranean. Hercules' rest after his Labor (as Rossi has pointed out, in the pose of an antique river god) takes place in a proto-historical landscape of the Aventine Hill (fig. 4), whose Roman setting thus justifies a classical amphitheater in the following scene; during the hero's rest a second mon- ster, Cacus (here in the anthropomorphic guise of a giant), steals the magical cattle, pulling them by the tail so as to confuse their tracks, into his cave. As Hercules grapples with the robber in the perhaps slightly later third scene (fig. 5), Cacus is transformed into a lion-bodied centaur: Spencer notes this crucial identification in the allegorizing late antique text of Fulgentius, who (it should now be added) uses the conceit of a dialogue with Virgil himself to uncover the allegorical meanings of the Aeneid,59 recognized by Can- nata as the fundamental source for this series. In this read- ing, the fourth scene would then represent Hercules trium- phant over the slain figure of Cacus, seen once more in human (or giant) form (fig. 6). Panofsky indeed commented on Cacus' dual nature - "Ideo et duplex dicitur" - as not only one of the monsters of nature and death whom Hercules 110</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 5.

Kress Collection vanquishes in behalf of human tranquility, but also, through his metamorphosis into a leonine centaur, as a monstrous emblem of human vice:60 both aspects, finally, being van- quishable only through the constant exercise of Fortitude on the part of both mankind and its exemplar, Hercules. Such a carefully developed concetto , depending as it does upon an arcane late antique/early Christian commentary on a classical text composed in Mantua, presupposes Moderno s access to antiquarian humanists at a learned court, a con- nection, as has already been noted, such as he could have had through Girolamo Mondella's associations with the Fer- rarese humanists Antonio Tebaldeo and Laura Brenzoni- Schioppo.61 The circumstance recalls Sir George Hill's hy- pothesis of 1917 that Moderno s signed Hercules series might relate to the personality of the reigning duke of Ferrara, Ercole I d'Esté (1431-1505, acceded 1471). 62 Given Giro- lamo Mondella's warm relations with that court, such a program is eminently possible; but, as I have previously pointed out, Moderno s own demonstrable intimacy with the artistic life of Mantua- whose cultural affairs were pre- sided over from the end of the 1480s by Ercole's daughter Isabella d'Este - makes it doubly plausible that such a com- memorative commission might have originated at either one of these closely associated courts.03 Indeed the fact that our artist's signature inscription o[PVS] • moderni shows up - for the first time - on the cycle of the Hercules plaquettes in the late 1480s, strongly suggests that the apparently si- multaneous appearance of Pier Jacopo Alari's trade name, in the same town, is not coincidental: he is first called "Antixi" in a Mantuan letter of 1487. 64 The masterwork of this newly coherent style combining late quattrocento eclecticism with Mantegna's Mantuan classicism - and indeed one of Moderno's most appealing designs of any period - is his small plaquette with a "Sacra Conversazione" of the Madonna and Child with Six Saints (fig. 7). 65 It has routinely been assumed to date much later than it does, for Moderno eventually worked out a radically restructured revision of its composition in the celebrated masterpiece of his late years, the large Sacra Conversazione in Vienna, of 1506-1509 (plate 1).66 The element that has been supposed to connect these two differently conceived designs is their elaborate background of decoratively pat- terned ornament;67 but that in the Vienna relief displays an informed understanding of antique "grotesque'' work, as those delicate paintings and relief stuccoes were being ex- cavated in Rome at the moment that Moderno's larger relief was made;68 whereas the background ornament in the smaller plaquette is not composed of interconnected "grotteschi" at all, but rather of individuated candelabra and pendant trophies. In this regard it parallels exactly the isolated tro- phy standards on the attributed Mazzanti medal's reverse: the sources for each are again Mantegnesque - not only from the Triumphs but also from such conveniently circulating intermediaries as the so-called "Mantegna Sketchbook" now in Berlin.69 A unique gilded silver example of the small plaquette, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, might pos- LE WIS 111</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 7.

Kress Collection sibly be Moderno's prime original (fig. 7): it includes two airborne putti hovering above pendant swags in the upper corners that were omitted in the replicated bronze casts.70 The essential source for this graceful exemplar of late fifteenth-century attenuated classicism is Lorenzo Costa's fresco of 1488 in the Bentivoglio Chapel at San Giacomo Maggiore in Bologna, with its Madonna and Child on a high throne flanked by the family of the donors: the gestures of the holy pair, their enframement by pilasters with socles and attic blocks of figurated reliefs, the topmost sculptured tondo flanked by putti, the base of the throne with a hor- izontal panel of rinceaux and a large central relief, flanked by children, the proportions of the foreground figures, and even the gesture of the one on the right, all derive from Costas colossal fresco.71 But its miniature adaptation by Moderno achieves more than a merely gracile delicacy: Cos- ta's composition is episodic and staccato, with disconcerting shifts of scale and an imperfectly resolved perspective; Mo- derno's flickering background ornament unifies his tiny re- lief in a single plane, and his central band of elongated figure types provides a counterpoise to the dematerialized solidity of his central throne. He lightens the summit of that structure by substituting for Costa's multifigured tondo a near-quotation of Tommaso di Callisto's 1482 relief of an Antique Sacrifice ,72 further evidence of his knowledge of contemporaneous Mantuan sculpture. The crowning frieze band just below the topmost relief element of the Madonna's throne presents a microscopic image of Hercules abducting the cattle of Geryon, in essentially the same form as on Moderno's introductory plaquette in the immediately pre- ceding series of signed Labors. His beautiful plaquette with the small Sacra Conversazione soon had a measurable in- fluence of its own: its right-hand figure group seems to have spawned a miniature cognate plaquette of David and Ju- dith,73 while its central superstructure, together with its appealing angelic musicians, furnished part of the inspira- tion for Bernardino Butinone's Madonna and Child En- throned (once attributed to Liberale da Verona)- whose crowning tondo, in turn, reflects yet another plaquette of Moderno's, the Presentation in the Temple (fig. 17). 74 The evident popularity of Moderno's signed Hercules se- ries seems to have encouraged him, within a short time of their production, to issue a slightly larger pair of related plaquettes that presage the development of his mature style. These are his Standing Hercules with the Nemean Lion and Hercules Overcoming Antaeus : we may appropriately con- sider the latter first, for the former (though representing the earliest canonical Labor) is the more developed in style. Moderno's Hercules and Anteaeus75 (fig. 8) - the present census would afford him only this one treatment of the theme - is a regrouping of the figures from the fourth pla- quette of the signed series, here called Hercules Trium- phant over Cacus. The hero is identically draped and hooded, and again shown frontally, standing with clasped arms: within them he crushes the giant Antaeus, seen from the rear, his pose with both legs flexed and head thrown back, essentially 112</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 9.

The victim's gestures are as agonized as those of the thieves in Moderno's Cru- cifixion ; but, tamed for gentler contexts, they recur through- out the artist's mature work. This transitional Antaeus pla- quette betrays its contemporaneity with Moderno's works of the late 1480s through its close congruence with the Slain Cacus and through the curiously retardative provincial clas- sicism of its ruined loggia of broken piers and pedestals. Their meticulous perspectivai rendering and delicate or- namental patterning (in which they closely resemble the throne in the small Sacra Conversazione) are ill-matched with their violent subject; we might compare the much more epic struggle of Hercules with the Monster Centaur (fig. 5), grandly set before a global landscape of imperial decay. The Moderno shop eventually perceived this incongruity in the Antaeus : a later revision shows the piers purged of foliate ornament, continuing upward to support an awkward ar- chitecture of continuous groin vaulting, turning the loggia into a single bay of an open cloister/6 The angular late quattrocento torsion of the main figure group seems slightly to predate a similar but more classically controlled com- position in an engraving of the 1490s by Gian Antonio da Brescia,77 apparently after a lost drawing by Mantegna78 that may also have inspired Moderno. The Standing Hercules with the Nemean Lion 79 (fig. 9) is shown to be a contemporaneous pendant to the Hercules and Antaeus plaquette by identical size and border mold- ings, as well as by a common source of inspiration: and this, for the first time in Moderno's oeuvre, is treated as an archaeologically exact rendering of antiquity. The motif of the tightly coiled body of the lion closely grappled by the standing hero derives from a superb didrachmon of Her- akleia in Magna Graecia, current arount 350 B.C.80 The gen- eral configuration reappears on several gems, mostly me- dieval but some perhaps as late as the quattrocento;81 these show the hero more nearly in profile (anticipating Moderno's image), but with knees flexed and back hunched; this type also inspired a free-standing Renaissance statuette.82 Mo- derno sharply revises these prototypes to depict the hero proudly erect, with only his head bowed in acknowledge- ment of the combat. The resulting monumentality of his design seems clearly to bespeak an intimate knowledge of the antique numismatic original, and Rossi has shown that this can be demonstrated by its influence as well on the companion plaquette: the idiosyncratic pose of Hercules' legs, in the Heraclean coin, exactly recurs in Moderno's Hercules and Antaeus.83 Through its creative adaptation of a distinguished antique source, its monumentality, its majestic balance of solid and void, and the harmonious cadences of its rhythmic structure, the Standing Hercules marks perhaps a more significant milestone in Moderno's development than any work we have yet encountered. It is the first to employ a direct and unfiltered classicism, the inauguration in his oeuvre of per- LE WIS 113</page><page sequence="10">Fig. il. Pietà between Candelabra , c. 1490, bronze, 8.1 x 5.8 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Samuel H. Kress Collection sonally reworked antique imagery, brilliantly thought out and grandly resolved. It is his first design boldly to include large areas conspicuously devoid of both image and orna- ment (though the original state of its companion Antaeus also hints at this discovery, as more tentatively do his four signed Hercules plaquettes). Above all, it is the first of the artist s images, since the hesitant incunabulum of his Large Saint Sebastian , to celebrate the grandeur of one single, dominant, human form. This powerful focus on the mon- umental human figure was to become a recurring ideal in Moderno's art. A more developed relationship of a dominant central fig- ure with an elaborated spatial context is presented in Mo- derno's Small Saint Sebastian84 (fig. 10), a work almost ex- actly commensurate with the two we have just examined. Its commanding central figure is identical to the Saint Se- bastian from the Madonna del Fiore altarpiece in the Trevi- san cathedral, signed and dated by Girolamo da Treviso in 1487. 85 That work, in turn, might well be thought to depend from the painting (or perhaps the preliminary designs) of Mantegna's Saint Sebastian now in the Ca ďOro, a work that remained, however, in the artist's Mantuan studio until his death almost two decades later.86 Because of this fact, as well as the considerably closer (and highly characteristic) dependence of Moderno's image directly upon Mantegna's Mantuan prototype, I should like to propose that this un- studied three-part sequence must run from Mantegna to Moderno to Girolamo. Such a seriation would conveniently offer a terminus ante quern of 1487 both for Mantegna's poorly dated picture (or at least its design), and for Moder- no's dateless plaquette, on the basis of Girolamo da Treviso's obvious quotation of the latter (complete with its arrows in the same positions and its inorganically imported column) in his Madonna del Fiore of that year. It would also make the engravers Zoan Andrea (who copies the image rather lifelessly),87 Nicoletto da Modena (who exactly reverses it),88 and even Dürer (who slightly revises it, around 1499)89 the heirs rather than the originators of this persuasive formal type.90 The archaeologizing detail of Moderno's plaquette, with its lower horseman reproduced from an aureus of Had- rian,91 supporting an "armed Aphrodite" of a type encoun- tered by 1482 in Mantua,92 would thus convincingly refer the several similar antique borrowings that we have just reviewed to the same period of the later 1480s in Mantua. The confident use of open space, the monumentality of the central image, and the creative use of classicizing detail Fig. 12.

Large Saint Jerome , c. 1490, bronze, 7.8 x 6.0 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Samuel H. Kress Collection are all decisive factors in the success of a plaquette that, in my view, has been unfairly doubted as Moderno s, a thoughtful and elegant Pietà , with the dead Christ held upright in the tomb by the Virgin and Saint John93 (fig. 11). The scheme is closely based on pictures by the Bellini - especially the early Pietà with similar sarcophagus and candelabra in the Venetian Ducal Palace,94 as well as Giovanni's Angel Pietà in the Museo Correr95 - that in turn recall prototypes by Mantegna, such as the central figure in a full-length Pietà with Angels now in Copenhagen,96 and a half-length Angel Pietà in the Ove tari Antechapel of the Eremitani in Padua.97 But the Virgin in this plaquette wears the same hooded veil as do the pious women in Moderno s Crucifixion (fig. 2), and we will find even closer analogies among the figures in his Lamentation (fig. 15). The candelabra at the sides of the Pietà (which, as Saxl observed, transform the sarcophagus with its figurai frieze of antique sacrifices into a Christian altar)98 are near duplicates of those at the edges of the small Sacra Conversazione , and the exaggerated perspective of their bases recalls the throne in that plaquette, as well as the awkward piers of Antaeus' loggia (they were recalled, in relation to a similar garland, by Girolamo Mocetto in his altarpiece of 1517 for Santa Maria in Organo at Verona).99 Most interestingly of all, perhaps, the use of haloes is rare to the point of nonexistence in Moderno s work; but three of them show up in the Pietà in exactly the same form as in his undoubted Small Saint Sebastian , which must be nearly contemporaneous. Such haloes occur again in his signed Sacra Conversazione discussed immediately below (fig. 12), and a final one appears in the Resurrection (fig. 19), which may well date from the same period as these designs. The year of the accession of Isabella ďEste as Marchesa of Mantua in 1490 brings us to the pivotal work of Moderno's career, his intricately elaborated plaquette of the Madonna and Child with Saints Anthony Abbot and Jerome (fig. 12), of which the reverse of one example was inscribed with the date 1490, and the obverse of another with the word MANTVA.100 The variant reverse inscriptions on this frequent plaquette are worth citing in full, for they first suggested Moderno's identity as Galeazzo Mondella of Verona. A sin- gle example catalogued in the Alfred Higgins sale in 1904 and published with the Paul Gamier collection in 1906, as well as in the latter's sale of 1916 (but since lost sight of), was inscribed with the artist's name as Mondella;101 a con- siderable number of other specimens bear better or worse examples of a cast-in inscription naming him as Moderno.102 The variant readings are as follows: HOC • OPVS • mondela • VER • ¿/RIFEX • MCCCCXC HOC • OPVS • MO DERNI • C • C • Both inscriptions pose questions that are as yet unanswered. "Mondella's" is reported to have included an elided abbre- viation which subsequent commentators have read as ADER, and some have assumed to represent a family name, others a place name; but apparently the only Italian town ever called "Aderno" (as the inscribed letters have universally been expanded) is the present Adrano, in central Sicily, which is out of the question.103 In consultation with Ulrich Middeldorf, however, Rognini in 1975 proposed that Messrs. Christie had either misread or mistranscribed these letters, and that the supposedly elided A and D were in fact to be interpreted as a single letter V (perhaps with curved or flourished serifs). The resulting form VER[ONENSlS] is both plausible and persuasive,104 and does away with a perhaps overingenious theory that Moderno might have formed his pseudonym by attaching the first syllable of his family name to that of his (evidently mythical) birthplace.105 But "Mo- derno's" inscriptions on the same plaquette of 1490 include lewis 115</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 14.

Kress Collection the abbreviations • C • C • that in turn have never been satisfactorily explained. I wonder whether instead of con- cealing further clues to his identity (established after all on the two preceding lines), they might not stand for something like COMITES CONFECTORES,100 "associated makers," in short, a trademark of "Moderno &amp; Co.," attesting an authorized Veronese edition of a design perhaps initially developed in Mantua. In any event, the artist inscribed his trade name on many of these reliefs, but his family name on only one (indeed, so far as we know, on only one work in his entire career, although his occasional initial M may stand for either form). These proposals should not distract us, however, from the accomplished mastery of the plaquette itself. It is sil- houetted in the form of a miniature altarpiece, and in fact was very frequently mounted so as to be freestanding, with an attractive handle attached at right angles to the reverse. The standard assumption is that a plaquette was equipped with a handle in order to be presented, as a pax, for the "kiss of peace" at the celebration of the Mass; but recent commentators have suggested that some such objects must have been intended or at any rate employed for private use,107 an idea borne out in this case by the nature of the image. Its architectural aedicule is shown (within the com- pass of its small size) as a monumental tabernacle, with a deep shell-headed niche framed by sculptured columns that support a semicircular pediment, containing a lunette relief of the Resurrection - an enframing structure, in other words, of formal and hieratic design.108 But it is populated by sacred figures who treat it very informally indeed. The Virgin has moved her curved and sculptured throne assymmetrically to one side, and she leans on one elbow against the frame of the niche while offering her breast to the Child. He is shown as so engrossed in nursing as to have turned his back on us completely; while Saints Anthony and Jerome - the latter apparently interpreted with close reference to the same figure in a similar placement on Cimas altarpiece of 1489 in Vicenza109 - lean quietly against the flanking col- umns, absorbed respectively in reverie and reading; angelic musicians sprawl lazily underfoot with their lutes, while more acrobatic cherubs swing a jeweled festoon across the frieze. Precedents for such creative informality are rare in late quattrocento Italy, but more frequent in early fifteenth- century Flanders: the Salting Madonna by the Master of Flémalle in London, of c. 1430, offers a precise prototype for Moderno s pose of the Virgin, while Rogier van der Weyden's Madonna of c. 1432 in Vienna, and the 1433 Madonna attributed to Jan van Eyck in Melbourne, both depict the Child whose back is turned while nursing.110 A possible intermediary may have been Foppa's half-length Madonna and Nursing Child of the early 1460s now at I Tatti,111 but Moderno's insouciant children and bearded, self-absorbed saints are paralleled more closely in time and place with works by Montagna and Bonsignori in Verona: several prominent examples indeed shortly postdate Moder- no's plaquette of 1490, as a confirmation of its precocity.112 By the mid- 1490s or the turn of the century its design seems widely reflected: Lodovico Brea of Nice may refer to it in a Nursing Madonna on a Shell-Headed Throne of 1494;113 Cima's Parma altarpiece of 1496/1498 follows the pose of its Virgin exactly;114 Nicole tto da Modena recalls its composi- tion in a sgraffito ceramic plate of the mid-first decade of the cinquecento in Padua,115 and a late Annunciation in the Borromeo collection by Vincenzo Foppa closely reproduces the attitude of Moderno's Virgin.116 At least one example of the plaquette itself was brightly colored with glazed en- amels,117 and such a specimen may have inspired a larger maiolica variant, inscribed with the date of 1562 and a locus of production in Mantua.118 Moderno s two related compositions of Saint Jerome in Penitence bracket a span of some fifteen years after 1490, but the larger of the two may plausibly be assigned to that transitional year. In size, border moldings, and creative use of empty space this handsome plaquette (fig. 13) closely parallels the Pietà (fig. 11): it may be that these commen- surate works of penitential devotion are in some sense a pair. The iMrge Saint Jerome119 features a monumentalized version of an element that first appears (in both the Stealing and the Triumph scenes) in the signed Hercules series: the arched mouth of a rocky cavern, whose dark interior affords 116</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 15.

Kress Collection a circumscribed blank ground with which to frame key ele- ments of the figurai action. The motif becomes a Moderno trademark: it occurs in no less than nine autograph works involving landscapes, and at least seven derivative scenes by his followers.120 The artist may have acquired it from the source that inspired both his Saint Jeromes , an early panel by Vincenzo Foppa in the Accademia Carrara, probably painted in Brescia before 1456. 121 This work contributed not only the four crucial elements of Moderno's design - cave, saint, lion, and crucifix - but also their internal relationships and even their proportions in the closely similar composi- tional frame. Moderno modifies only the pose of the saint - to swing the right arm with its rock free of the newly un- draped torso - in conformity with Crivellis configuration in the predella of his Matelica altarpiece in London, painted at Venice probably shortly after April of 1490. 122 Bartolomeo Montagna in Vicenza in the late 1490s simply combined Foppa's and Crivelli s poses,123 but we can demonstrate Moderno s more inventive amalgam to have been in exis- tence at least by c. 1496, through a replication of its most original element in Cima s Madonna of the Orange Tree for Murano.124 This is the saint s open-handed gesture of sup- plication before the crucifix, with his left wrist sharply bent back and the thumb extended: we may confidently identify the highly characteristic gesture as another "signature mo- tif" of Moderno s, occurring with the thieves in his Cru- cifixion, and in the Antaeus , both in the late 1480s, as well as in several subsequent works, including the Entombment and the signed Flagellation .125 The unique Small Saint Jerome in the Kress Collection (fig. 14), as both Molinier and Ricci recognized, is a beau- tifully characteristic mature work by Moderno,126 indeed the first that we have encountered to exemplify the lyrical gracility that distinguishes the work of his later periods from his wiry, expressive torsion in the 1480s and 1490s. The almost dancing rhythms of the saint's extraordinary pose may perhaps owe something to their rather more angular and awkward parallels in Cima s London Saint Jerome , with arms extended forward and back of a frontward-leaning torso. Cimas picture is assigned by Peter Humfrey to c. 1504 or later; but its previous dating to the years around 1500 may be marginally preferable, since it was acquired from a col- LE WIS 117</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 17.

Kress Collection lection in Verona,127 where it might plausibly have been the catalyst for Moderno s much more fluent redaction (here dated c. 1505-1507). The Small Saint Jerome has a further claim on our attention: it inaugurates an almost miniatur- izing taste in Moderno's work, perhaps occasioned by his inventing the image as a glyptic prototype; a Renaissance intaglio in the Hermitage displays the same composition,128 and reminds us that Vasari (who had better sources for his later periods) thought of Mondella/Moderno primarily as a gem engraver.129 A rare plaquette, idiosyncratic in size and date - appar- ently not belonging to any pair or series, and possibly a good deal earlier than is suggested by its order in sequence here - is the Lamentation of Christ (fig. 15), with the three Marys and Saint John in a rocky landscape.130 Moderno s placement of the body of Christ and its supporting circle of mourners may possibly be related to Cimas Lamentation now in Modena, evidently commissioned about 1493/1495 for Alberto Pio, lord of Carpi;131 but the angular disposition of Christ s legs upon the edge of the sarcophagus derives from an older source such as Antonello's Correr Pietà of c. 1475, 132 and the rest of the image is almost all assembled from elements in a Mantegna school engraving, also of c. 1475, of The Emtombment with the Four Birds.133 From that print comes the exact form of the rocky landscape and foreground, with its angled peaks, clinging tree, view of Golgotha, and caverned sepulchre - though Moderno personalizes this last element, curving its aperture more tightly around his fig- ures. The Mantegnesque print also contributes his figures of the Magdalene and the Virgin Mary, together with the head of the third Mary to the right. Only the Saint John, with his tender support of Christ's extended left arm, is newly composed; but it was sufficiently persuasive to be adopted verbatim by Montagna, in his altarpiece of 1504- 1506 for Santi Nazaro e Celso in Verona.134 The plaquette was more widely diffused by 1509, when it provided a model for an altar at Tirano in the Valtellina, above Brescia.135 A Moderno shop variant, with the plaquette cut out in a sil- 118</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 19.

Moderno's han- dling of the Magi has been cited as an example of an ar- chaizing "neo-Gothic" taste in the last decade of the quat- trocento,138 and in it there may be more than a hint of such an International Style prototype as Domenico Veneziano's Adoration in Berlin-Dahlem.139 But his precise source was Antonio Vivarinťs similar cycle of six panels of the Life of the Virgin now in Wiesbaden, which provided the first two of his compositions, the Magi and the Presentation , almost ready-made.140 Vivarinťs Adoration of the Magi of c. 1445 is a vertical rectangle with the same design in the same proportions as Modernos: its exotic procession (including camels in the upper register) winds through a landscape of pointed peaks to cross the foreground from left to right toward the Holy Family, similarly posed, in front of a similar stable, under a similar star. The two foremost Magi, in turn (as well as certain details of the Holy Family), are derived from Man- tegna's Adoration of the 1460s for the Mantuan palace chapel, now in the Uffizi.141 Only three of Moderno s characteristic attendants are newly added: one is a somewhat uncanonical infant Saint John(?) tugging at the Virgin's cloak on the extreme right, another is a tiny lapdog at his feet, and the third is a groom removing the youngest King's spurs on the extreme left. The latter motif may have originated in a quintessential late Gothic International Style masterwork, Gentile da Fabriano's Adoration of 1423 in the Uffizi; 142 but Moderno s source was closer to home, in a drawing of the lewis 119</page><page sequence="16">mid-quattrocento by Jacopo Bellini; 143 from his plaquette it was taken over by Vincenzo Foppa, in an Adoration of c. 1500 now in London.144 In one more example of direct copying from Moderno, it is used with the same kingly figure and the same horse in a signed Epiphany of the early cin- quecento by Baldassare Carrari da Forlì;145 a late Lombard reflection by Ceasare da Sesto (1477-1523), the only one of these parallels to have been noticed,140 is too indirect and unfocused to be relevant. The formal genealogy of the second plaquette in Mo- derno's christological series, the Presentation of Christ in the Temple (fig. 17), 147 is identical to that of the preceding Adoration. Antonio Vivarini's mid-quattrocento Venetian panels of the Life of the Virgin include a Presentation of Christ whose principal features are all appropriated by Mo- derno, with the minor modifications of left-to-right reversal, an enlivening of poses and draperies, and the addition of three of his little lapdogs in the foreground.148 All the ele- ments indeed that have been thought symptomatic of other sources, as for example the pose of the Christ Child and the head of the bearded Simeon,149 are in fact taken from Fig. 23.

Kress Collection the Venetian prototype: the Child directly, with the type of the High Priest being filtered through the experience of Mantegna's Circumcision for the Mantuan palace chapel (now in the Uffizi),150 that evidently influenced an inter- mediate Milanese Presentation by Foppa as well.151 The most original and characteristic element added to the com- position by Moderno himself is the superb fictive sculptural ornament of the altar frontal, with its graceful arabesque of garlands, medallions, and anthemion foliage held between elegant sphinxes with addorsed wings. An identical pair of sphinxes, similarly placed, shows up on a drawing by Mon- tagna at Windsor; 152 and a miniature plaquette with an or- namental relief of a Harpy between Griffins,153 precisely synchronous in style, is guaranteed to Moderno or his shop by its inclusion in a contemporaneous tabernacle, integrally cast as a frame for his plaquette of the Crucifixion.154 The third scene of the Life of Christ cycle, the Entomb- ment (fig. 18), 155 is one of Moderno s greatest achievements: a masterwork rich with references to other milestones from his finest period, the later 1490s and the first years of the new century. It is also unusual, in his work to date, in its 120</page><page sequence="17">development from a sculptural source, rather than a pictorial or graphic one. We have noted that the Adoration and Presentation in this series were both composed from Vene- tian prototypes with direct reference to paintings by Man- tegna of the 1460s, made for the Gonzaga chapel in the Ducal Palace at Mantua. This third scene confirms that Moderno designed these plaquettes with Mantua strongly in mind, for its imagery depends from a large partially gilt bronze relief of the Entombment at Vienna,156 made in the immediate Mantuan orbit of Mantegna (and almost certainly to his design) in the mid- 1470s. 157 Mantegna's source was Donatello's relief of the Entombment in the Santo at Padua,158 but his 1470s Mantuan revision provided the heart of Mo- derno's composition: the exact pose of the body of Christ, which the attendants handle directly rather than with a winding sheet, with the saint at the feet transformed into a bearded elder. Most intriguingly, the fictive relief scene on the classicizing sarcophagus of the Mantuan bronze em- blematically presents a "Triumph over Death," through its reference to contemporaneous Tuscan cassone reliefs de- picting the Abduction and Return of Persephone; Moderno's counterpart, on the face of his fictive Antique sarcophagus, creatively develops a correspondingly allegorized "Triumph over Death," through a series of scenes from the legend of Saint Helen Overcoming the Reticence of the Jewish Wit- ness (?) and her Proving of the True Cross.159 In fact Mo- derno's whole composition becomes an emblematic allegory on the larger theme: the Cross appears not only on the front of the sarcophagus (recalling its growth, in the Golden Leg- end , from Adam's grave), but also on the road to Calvary in the middle ground, and in the Crucifixion on Golgotha in the distance. Moderno s figurai types here achieve a perfect balance - as in the signed Centaur plaquette (fig. 5) - between late quattrocento expressiveness and proto-cinquecento fluency. His body of Christ is a more gracefully disposed version of the body of Cacus in his signed Triumph plaquette (fig. 6), purged of its angular torsions, and given a rippling, affective anatomy of sacrificial splendor. The composition is grand and spacious, with the cavern of the Holy Sepulchre dra- matically framing the poignant figure of the Magdalene, wailing with arms upraised and hair disheveled, her hands repeating Saint Jerome's (and the crucified thieves') gestures of anguish and supplication. Her formal configuration does refer directly to Donatello's Santo relief, the motif from that model having become a Venetan speciality: examples close in type and date to Moderno's are Jacopo da Montagnana's Deposition of c. 1490 in the Cathedral of Padua,100 and Andrea da Murano's Lamentation of c. 1490-1495 in the Duomo at Cittadella.161 Once more, as so often, significant Fig. 25.

Kress Collection parallels in the Brescian painting of Vincenzo Foppa may just as well be dependent on Moderno as antecedent to him: a similarly composed but differently detailed Depo- sition of the 1490s in Berlin162 seems to me most likely to be a revision of the plaquette. It was mentioned at the outset of this essay that the fourth plaquette in Moderno's Life of Christ series, the Resur- rection (fig. 19), might have been composed earlier than its companions, given its quotation of a figure from the large Crucifixion plaquette. Conversely, of course, one might argue that both are contemporaneous with other works in the Christ series.163 The possibility seems open: the Mag- dalene with flowing hair at the foot of the cross in the lewis 121</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 26.

Kress Collection Crucifixion is closely paralleled by the same saint in the Entombment , and the faces of its Saint John and the Cru- cifixions Longinus share a common type; the latter's horse is almost a twin of that in the Adoration of the Magi , while the hooded women of the Crucifixion and Entombment are in some cases nearly indentical. Not only the replicated soldier but also Christ s fluttering drapery, in both the Cru- cifixion and the Resurrection , bring these two works to- gether; and in the latter Christ wears a tiny halo, which is otherwise restricted to three plaquettes of 1487/1490. 164 If the Crucifixion and Resurrection thus appear contempor- aneous and slightly earlier than the remaining scenes from the Life of Christ , we might also note that the fluttering drapery found in both is encountered in other works ap- parently dating around the turn of the century:165 it may be best therefore to recognize the Christ series as defining a transitional stage, on the threshold of the artist s mature style. A beautiful but neglected plaquette of Moderno s is his miniature tondo with a molded rim enframing a Running Hercules (fig. 20), 166 whose pose is borrowed from the relief on the Entombment sarcophagus: the slightly enlarged but otherwise identical figure is embellished with a fluttering drapery similar to the ones just discussed, placing this fur- ther "self-quotation" in the same transitional phase of the late 1490s. (The Running Hercules has a pendant tondo, an equally graceful David and Goliath (fig. 21), preserved in Berlin.)167 Support for this chronology is offered by the artist s incorporation of the same running figure - again en- larged, and now feminized - on the reverse of a medal of 1504 for Maddalena of Mantua , that I proposed in the pre- vious component of this study as the masterpiece of Mo- derno's occasional activity as a medalist.168 The resulting allegory of Opportunity Seizing Time (fig. 22) 169 is a triumph of that curvilinear calligraphy of fluttering hair and billowing drapery that so consistently characterizes Moderno s tran- sition from Early to High Renaissance forms, within a few years to either side of 1500. The medal's epigraphy is iden- tical (thus confirming Moderno s authorship) with that on his otherwise most "medallic" plaquette, a spectacular tondo inscribed Mars Enjoying Victory- of which the Kress Col- lection at the National Gallery of Art possesses both a trial proof170 as well as a finished version (fig. 23 and cover),171 both signed m[odernvs] . f[ecit]. Pope-Hennessy has deftly analyzed the process of ratio- cination and recomposition that led to the splendid reso- lution of the second state of the Mars; 172 the origins of the first state have been hypothesized but never demonstrated. In fact, the design appears to be a conflation of antique numismatic and modern graphic sources. The pose of the central figure seems to have been derived from a rare north Italian engraving of David Seated on a Trophy , that Hind places tentatively in Brescia around 1500. 173 Moderno's tro- phies, however, fan out radially behind the central cuirass (here functioning, like the engravers's, as a seat) in the same form as they do on an aureus of Marcus Aurelius, where also they are similarly encircled by monumental epigra- phy.174 The calligraphic intricacy and lyrical grace of Mo- derno's turn-of-the-century manner are nowhere more beautifully epiphanized than in the triumphant tondo of the Mars : its intense linear energy coils like a spring around the central figure, which resolves these implicit tensions in a perfect equipoise of delicacy and gravity. My previous study of the relationships connecting Mo- derno's plaquettes with contemporaneous medals from the Mantuan court (some evidently designed by him) estab- lished dates close to his Christ-cycle Entombment and final Mars for several other reliefs. His Orpheus Beaten by Maenads (fig. 24) 175 - possibly derived from the reverse of a Florentine medal of c. 1490, by an artist close to Niccolò Fiorentino- with Orpheus almost a direct reversal of his own Mars , must predate May/June 1503, when Melioli(?) borrowed its design for a medal of Lucrezia Borgia.176 Sim- 122</page><page sequence="19">ilarly, his rare pendant oval plaquettes of the Nemean Lion (fig. 25) 177 and Nessus (fig. 26) 178 can be shown to predate October 1507, when Giancristoforo Romano used a medal- lion on the latter as the reverse composition of his medal for Isabella of Aragon ; Dürer also made a drawing after its central composition in 1511. 179 Moderno' s sprightly Mars and Victory plaquette (fig. 27) 180 is essentially the same size as the Hercules series, and (like them) one of its casts is inscribed OPVS MODERNI; but its style is most comparable to the later Standing Hercules with the Lion, especially in its narrow fillet rim and creative use of- in this case - a completely blank ground. Like the Standing Hercules , it derives its composition from ancient numismatic prototypes (for example on a Flavian sester- tius) 181 of a Striding Mars who carries a sword in his right hand and a trophy of arms over his left shoulder. Such an antique model may also have been the source for Nicole tto da Modena, who made such images of a Trophy- Bearing Mars the subject of two niello-manner prints at about the same moment, around the turn of the century; 182 although in his larger example the pose, composition, and style are so similar as perhaps only to represent another instance of his work reflecting Moderno's. The plaquette design su- perimposes on the coin-type of the Mars a Victory , derived from the figure of Opportunity on the Mantuan medal of 1504 ascribed to Moderno himself.183 This same amalgam- ated composition occurs in a number of pseudo-antique cameos, most of which have been catalogued as post-clas- Fig. 27.

David and a Companion with the Dead Goliath , c. 1504/1505, bronze, 7.1 x 5.6 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Widener Collection sical: 184 since such a "layered" design might well have orig- inated as a cameo carving (though probably not in antiquity), it seems most likely to be an invention of Moderno the gem engraver185 - thus explicating at once its appealing union of linear elegance and volumetric weight, as well as its curi- ously glyptic effect on the plain ground of the plaquette. The Mars and Victory has an unrecognized pendant in Moderno s David and a Companion with the Dead Goliath (fig. 28), 186 a brilliantly composed rectangular plaquette with cognate dimensions and border treatment, and once more with a daringly original use of empty space. As a more fluent successor to the Standing Hercules , it concentrates on the isolated grandeur of the protagonist; again, as in that design, the calligraphic luxuriance of the head of the antagonist serves as a foil to the stark, heroic nudity of the central figure - here, for the first time, fully displayed. Other im- ages of direct classical inspiration are found in the body of the giant and the newly introduced companion (perhaps Jonathan?) -a monumentalization in reverse of the tiny groom in the Adoration plaquette 187 - contributing to the success of one of Moderno s finest designs. The figure of David is taken from an apparently antique prototype drawn by Jacopo Bellini (probably as a direct borrowing from the latter's Louvre sketchbook) 188 but from the waist up it also exactly reverses Moderno s own figure of Mars, complete with re- worked left arm and helmet (which is identical as well with that in the pendant Mars and Victory plaquette). The body of Goliath is typically derived from a Mantuan prototype lewis 123</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 29. Battle Scene , c. 1504, shell cameo, 2.0 x 1.4 cm, formerly Orléans Collection by Mantegna- in this case a monochrome David and Go- liath of the 1490s from the Gonzaga palace, now in Vienna.189 From the waist down the figure of David recalls antique sculptural types of ideal youths, perhaps interpreted via Tullio Lombardo's Adam of c. 1493 at Venice; 190 while the kneeling companion creatively reproduces an iconograph- ically appropriate figure, familiar from ancient sarcophagus reliefs (of which the best example is in Mantua),191 of an attendant at the sacrificial beheading of a bull. The plaquette was immediately popular: as early as 1508 it was reproduced in the cloister of Saint- M artin at Tours,192 and even "il divino Michelangelo" himself seems to have composed directly from David s companion one of the most prominent of the angelic assistants in his Last Judgment for the Sistine Chapel.193 Moderno s awareness of the archaeological phase of the late quattrocento study of antiquity may have been gained through the mediation of Giovanni Maria Falconetto, who is said to have spent twelve years in Rome (most plausibly Fig. 30. Battle of Cannae, 1504/1505, bronze, d. 5.2 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Samuel H, Kress Collection between c. 1485 and c. 1497). 194 This celebrated importer of Roman Renaissance style into the Veneto was born in Verona within a year of Moderno, also worked under Gon- zaga patronage in Mantua, and is attested as Moderno's associate: Vasari says that Galeazzo collected Falconetto drawings.195 Exactly such a sheet is an impressive double medallion drawing in the Albertina in Vienna, with circular compositions freely developed from the Trajanic and Au- relian reliefs on the Arch of Constantine.196 Moderno cer- tainly had access to such images (or possibly to cognate antique reliefs in Emilia or the Marches) when he designed a Combat composition recorded in a Renaissance shell cameo in the Orléans collection (fig. 29), 197 which provided the common source for two small tondi- the Battle of Cannae (a medal that immediately postdates December, 1503; fig. 30) and a plaquette with a Lion Hunt (fig. 31). 198 The three mounted warriors in the Orléans cameo (of whom the two on the left were to become the central elements in the Battle of Cannae , and whose foremost figure is reproduced in the same position on the Lion Hunt ) derive verbatim from the "Great Trajanic Frieze" in the inner passage of the Arch of Constantine.199 That the vehicle of transmission to Moderno may well have been Falcone tto's Vienna drawing is demonstrated by the figure at the bottom center (in both the cameo and the Cannae plaquette), who has fallen with his horse. This motif is again taken directly from such a sarcophagus relief as that of the Battle of Romans and Barbarians , now in the Galleria Borghese:200 Falconetto's synthesizing sketch - though jerky and awkward in this regard - seems to have inspired Mo- derno to his splendidly fluent combination of such motifs, to which he has added (in the cameo and Cannae images, and again from a prototype in the Trajanic frieze) a second fallen soldier beneath the rearing horse. This beautifully equilibrated pyramidal composition201 is framed in the cameo by figures of foot soldiers leaning outward but turning back in upon the battle: there they appear as creative borrowings from such a source as the Battle of the Amazons sarcophagus in the Vatican Belvedere.202 From the cameo they are taken over exactly in the Lion Hunt , where the background horse- man's position and gesture (as again in the cameo) comes directly from the same antique prototype. The lion itself, finally, together with the backhanded gesture of the lateral figure(s) attacking it, and the warrior fallen beneath it, all derive from a late antique sarcophagus type of which an example is at San Elpidio a Mare, in the Marches.203 An early Antonine Amazonomachia sarcophagus relief, of which an example is in the Mantuan ducal palace,204 inspired a late "Moderno and shop" plaquette of a Battle Scene in- scribed DVBIA forty NA (fig. 32), 205 as a somewhat inorganic 124</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 31.

Its leaping horses are unconvincingly reproduced from the Orléans cameo, via the Cannae plaquette (for their extended hind legs) and the Lion Hunt (for their riders' pose). The newly added elements of the shield-bearing soldier toppled backwards by the force of the charge (which is interpreted via Modernos Struggling Antaeus type), and the horse falling face down, are both contributed by the Amazon sarcophagus in Mantua, without quite redeeming the image: at least they suggest some par- ticipation in this design by Moderno himself. As if to insist on this point, the last two letters of the inscription are rather ostentatiously - and uncharacteristically - elided to form an "M," presumably as a shop trademark. The DVBIA FORTV NA and the Battle of Cannae were both reproduced on a plaquette-ornamented bookbinding for Jean Grolier, in Milan, in 1509/1510.206 The masterpiece of Moderno s "archaeologically" classi- cizing style is his magnificent tondo relief of the Fall of Fig. 35.

Etruscan gems show very similar configurations.208 The most celebrated proto- type for the Renaissance, however, was the Phaeton Sar- cophagus formerly on the façade of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in Rome, of which drawings (as in the Codex Escurialensis) had begun to circulate before the end of the quattrocento.209 Moderno had developed his own very free adaptation before about 1508, since Holbein sketched its composition on the reverse of a drafted portrait of that period;210 later Michel- angelo may have used it as well, especially in the first of his three famous drawings of the theme.211 The balance and foil of richy modeled forms, intricate curvilinear detail, and dramatic open space is nowhere better handled by Moderno than in the Phaeton. After this achievement opens the final chapter of his late style. Left: Fig. 37.

Be- yond the rider and foreground gulf a friezelike band of actively gesturing onlookers stands before a sophisticated architectural background, of columns en ressault before a festooned wall. This device becomes a leitmotif of Moderno's late style: we find it again contemporaneously in his beau- tiful plaquette of Augustus and the Tiburtine Sibyl (fig. 35), 213 in which Pope-Hennessy has justly praised the Ra- phaelesque figure group214 (the Augustus is a reversal of Moderno's own Small Saint Jerome , of the same period). Here the double-festooned panels of antique "grotteschi" decorations, on a wall now articulated by Braman tesque pilasters, have exact correspondences with two ornamental prints of 1507 by Nicole tto da Modena, whom we know to have been in Rome in that year.215 Another late work with an ancient prototype for its iconography and composition, as well as for its two pendent "grotteschi" ornaments, is a rare roundel of Prometheus Creating Man ,216 as the first sculptor (fig. 36): its forms as well as its subject are prefig- ured on a Hellenistic relief of a type that was evidently known to north Italian artists.217 Moderno's central figure of the newly created putto stands dramatically forward of its background, as a new feature of his rapidly developing "High Renaissance" style; it presages the full volumetric grandeur of his last works. On a still smaller scale even than on the delicate Pro- metheus medallion, its actively posed child reappears in reverse in a group of the Madonna and Child with two Kneeling Angels on a unique plaquette purchased in 1856 for the Victoria and Albert Museum (fig. 37), 218 where it was eventually joined by its exceedingly rare pendant, a Small Entombment of Christ (fig. 38), through the Salting Bequest in 1910. 219 This tiny pair of Moderno masterworks is breathtaking in its minutely scaled monumentality. In the highly unusual image of the first, the Child stands by the left side but within the embrace of his Mother, whose boldly three-dimensional pose is given a dynamic torsion by the opposing twist of her upper body, as she regards an angel kneeling on her right; a second angel, kneeling beside Christ, looks up to offer him a basket of fruit. The four figures are supported on the wide seat of a relief-fronted throne, whose elaborately decorated rear panel and canopy (in the form of a tapestried or sculptured baldachin) present imaginative variations on ornamental engravings made by Zoan Andrea in 1505, as well as by Nicoletto da Modena around 1507. 220 At the sides of the baldacchino appear the same free-hanging pendants of three-dimensional "grottes- chi" as we saw suspended from the hands of Prometheus' putto: this conceit seems to be an original invention of Moderno's, for almost nowhere else in early cinquecento art are beribboned "grotteschi" seen emerging freely into fictive space. His pendant Small Entombment repeats the ornamental sarcophagus and the attitude of Christ's body (in reverse) from his early iMmentation, though both bor- rowings here display a much more developed classicizing style.

Tannahill Nicodemus set vertically behind the bier, with the Mag- dalene above them again in the background: all three seem to reflect the highly emotional expressiveness of earlier Emilian Entombment groups in terra-cotta, by Niccolò dell'Arca and Guido Mazzoni.221 These tiny triumphs of small-scale design can be paral- leled by another pair of miniature masterworks, recalling once more Moderno s training in goldsmith's work, and his reputation as a gem engraver. These are two very rare curvilinear plaquettes made in shapes resembling inverted pears, to serve as lids to one of the staples of humanist desk- furnishing, the neo-antique oil lamp. A Judgment of Solo- mon is shown on one lamp lid (fig. 39), 222 apparently as an allegory of Temperance, for on the other are the three remaining Theological Virtues, Justice , Prudence , and For- titude (fig. 40). 223 Maclagan recognized that these delicately beautiful designs were guaranteed to Moderno by the typ- ically creative reuse in the Solomon of one his own motifs: the mother rushing to save the threatened child is a reversed variant of the pursued figure in his Opportunity Seizing Time , of 1504 (fig. 22). 224 To this observation we might add the artist's reuse of the setting and scheme of his earlier Solomon medallion, on the oval Nemean Lion plaquette (fig. 25): the tall, stepped throne, however, has undergone a High Renaissance remodeling; and the "grotteschi" in the exergues of both lamp lids exactly parallel the others of about 1505 that we have just examined. A hitherto unrecognized commission to Moderno from metropolitan Venice is established by two other eccentri- cally silhouetted plaquettes, a pair of large butterfly-shaped ornaments designed as the obverse and reverse of a pommel for the handle of a large sword (fig. 41). Three such weapons survive, with the two plaquettes conjoined as their topmost element: one of the swords bears the arms of the E rizzo family of Venice.225 Since those blazons occur on other parts of the handle, they would not by themselves establish that the associated double plaquettes were originally produced for a Venetian client; but the central motif on their "reverse'' side (showing an Allegory of Victory ) is the Winged Lion of Saint Mark holding the open Gospel of the Evangelist, the unmistakable emblem of Venice.226 Furthermore, one of the earliest examples of a sword decorated with such a pommel is prominently depicted in an important private devotional panel, painted in Venice around 1504/1505 by Cima da Conegliano, a three-quarter length Madonna and Child with the Baptist and Saint Paul.227 Moderno's one "documented" sword-hilt was thus definitely ordered before 15°5 by a Venetian client, who evidently was sufficiently pleased as to commission its immediate inclusion in a large painting. We may learn more about this patron's identity by considering the image on its "obverse" plaquette, which presents two sequential scenes from the Continence of Sci- pio.228 Scipio Africanus, perhaps the greatest Roman field commander, was of the clan of the Cornelii , who were claimed as classical antecedents by the great Corner family of Venice (the Tuscanized form of their name being Cor- naro , Latinized Cornelius). The head of this clan in the first decade of the cinquecento, Giorgio Cornaro the elder, was widely regarded as the preeminent field commander in the Venetian state; he was also one of the Republic's most prom- inent statesmen, since he had lately induced his sister the queen of Cyprus to "donate" her realm to the Serenissima.229 128</page><page sequence="25">One of these same "Cornelian" plaquettes by Moderno, finally, has been recovered in modern times from a field outside the Cypriot capital of Famagusta.230 The icono- graphie, heraldic, political, and archaeological evidence thus combines to make it highly likely that this hauntingly beau- tiful and idiosyncratic double plaquette was commissioned by or for Giorgio Cornaro of Venice in the first years of the new century (to which the graceful fluency of its figurai and decorative style so clearly belongs); and that- with its rep- licas-it brought Moderno further patronage from highly placed members of the Venetian patriciate. Such a context of patronage during the artist's last years can in fact be demonstrated by most of his remaining works. One of the most durably popular of these is the finely detailed Madonna and Child with Two Standing Angels (fig. 42), 231 whose original casts seem to have been available either on a plain ground or with the deeply modeled group framed in a wide niche, with its curved top flanked by incised foliate ornament in the spandrels; later versions convert the ornament to relief, and bring it also down the flanking piers. Several examples were eventually mounted in pax form, but most seem to have been destined for private devotion; many are gilded, perhaps reflecting the prefer- ence of metropolitan owners. This is borne out by collectors' inscriptions on at least three good casts, which may be interpreted as citing Venetian patrician names: FLAVIVS CIC0[NIVS?], PIERO FRANCESCO] MALIPIERO, and (by ex- tension) A . P . M [alipiero?] ; 232 while on a fourth plaquette, in this case Moderno's earlier Adoration of the Magi , a Fig. 42.

Once more Mo- derno may have invented the design of this Madonna and Child as a gem engraving, for it is also reported in an intaglio carving in lapis lazuli.234 The considerable Venetian context that we have dem- onstrated for Moderno s increasingly opulent late works, involving the prominent Erizzo, Cornaro(?), Cicogna(?), Malipiero, and Giustinian families, can now be shown - with reference to Moderno's two greatest works - to have had, as perhaps its most important catalyst, the patronage of Venice's richest family, in the person of Cardinal Do- menico Grimani.235 Moderno's largest and most celebrated works are his sublime gilded silver reliefs, a paired Sacra Conversazione and Flagellation of Christ (plates 1 and 2), in the Imperial Collections in Vienna.230 It seems still to be lewis 129</page><page sequence="26">Plate i.

As a confirmation of this, they bear a Vienna silver-assayer's stamp of the period 1805-1807; but previous to 1805 they are documented as components of Cardinal Grimani's mag- nificent ebony "cabinet of antiquities" (the famous studiolo or scrigno Grimant), presented to the Venetian State by his nephew in 1593, and kept successively in the Marciana Library and the Ducal Palace.238 From Vasari's account of the Cardinal's fascination with the newly discovered Lao- coön, we learn why Moderno's signed Flagellation so proudly reflects its central figure: his great silver reliefs must evi- dently have been designed as companions to Jacopo San- sovino's celebrated bronze statuette of the Laocoön , com- missioned in wax by Bramante and cast in bronze for Cardinal Grimani, who held it his dearest possession.239 Thus the traditional debate about Moderno s "graphic sources'' for knowledge of the Laocoön evaporates, since he would have had a three-dimensional model readily to hand: Cardinal Grimani came frequently to the Veneto, and Vasari strongly suggests that he would not willingly be parted from his beloved bronze group. It has long been recognized that the elderly male figure protected and blessed by the Madonna in the Sacra Conversazione is a donor portrait: we may now establish that it represents Domenico Grimani, and that the monastic figure alongside him, behind Saint George, must therefore be his patron Saint Dominic. The patronage and placement of Moderno's greatest com- mission being thus established, the date of his miraculous Grimani reliefs can be newly specified as well. The Laocoön was discovered on 14 January 1506, was acquired by Pope Julius II on 23 March, and was installed (presumably with Bramante s supervision) in the Belvedere courtyard in early July.240 In that same year Sansovino arrived in Rome with 130</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 44. Kneeling Hercules with the Nemean Lion, c. 1508/1513, bronze, 7.8 x 6.6 cm, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Samuel H. Kress Collection Giuliano da Sangallo, and immediately began drawing and modeling the Belvedere antiquities; Cardinal Grimani, in turn, ordered Jacopo's wax reduction of the Laocoön to be cast at once, as soon as Raphael had judged it the winner of Bramante s informal contest to establish the best attitude for the statue's missing right arm.241 A near pictorial parallel for the Flagellation relief, less dynamic but perhaps related to Moderno s source for the principal tormenters of Christ (though his own Centaur and Combat plaquettes furnish fine models), is a Tuscan or Umbrian painting in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, conventionally dated c. 1505. 242 The traditional terminus post of 1506 for Moderno s silver reliefs is thus confirmed; for a terminus ante , contemporary engravings may still be of use. In the setting of the Flag- ellation Moderno developed his own version of Bramant- esque architecture, but as an updating of a Venetian model, provided to him by the ruined vaults in Cima s altarpiece from the mid- 1490s at the Madonna dell'Orto:243 both Gio- vanni Antonio da Brescia and Nicole tto da Modena repro- duced architectural elements from the silver relief, in prints of 1509 and c. 1512 respectively.244 We may confidently date Moderno's companion reliefs to that same span: most plau- sibly perhaps to its earlier years, since he is documented to have been in Venice itself in 1506-1507, 245 potentially in touch with his noble patron. So much has been said about these magnificent master- works - most especially in their brilliant recent analysis by Dieter Blume246 - that we need only comment on their most obvious characteristics. They are hermetically elaborated allegories of Redemption, signed by a Venetan artist, made with an intricately refined goldsmith's technique, in pre- cious metals, for a consummately sophisticated Venetian patron. They provide the unsurpassable climax of Moderno's tendencies toward decorative ornamentation (the rear wall of the Madonna's throne is the ne plus ultra of its type) as well as toward three-dimensional modeling; for his figures of Saint George and Saint Sebastian, in the Sacra Conver- sazione, are actually freestanding silver statuettes, bolted in to the illusionistic (and actual) recession of the relief. These splendid works represent the coming of Christ into the most glorious age of classical splendor, and the eventual destruc- tion of that old order by the sacrifice that is prefigured in the Flagellation, through the parallel with Laocoön's sac- rifice for Troy. They are, in sum, among the most perfect High Renaissance redactions of ancient imagery, hermetic allusiveness, and Christian meaning. In addition to the inspiration for Moderno's flagellated Christ provided by the Laocoön s Belvedere courtyard in- stallation of 1506, another work unveiled in the Vatican Palace in 1511 supplied the model for his rarest relief, the only surviving hardstone carving to bear his signature. This is a milky pearl-gray stone plaquette of Apollo holding his lyre (fig. 43), now also in the Imperial Collections in Vi- enna.247 It reproduces the fictive sculpture in the left-hand Fig. 45.

Moderno s exquisite miniature replica, in the monochrome medium of a special alpine stone, beautifully translates Raphael's fictive marble relief into a real sculpture of even more permanent material. Its ratio of depth to height is one to twelve, giving it a Vitruvian canon of freestanding proportion. Larger and more sculptural even than the detachable Saint Sebastian from Cardinal Grimani's silver relief, the Apollo (which may quite plausibly have been made for the same patron, and have come to Vienna from the same source) represents Moderno at the pinnacle of his confidently robust modeling of a radiant human form. Moderno s last two plaquettes proclaim that ultimate rar- ity, the phenomenon of a radically reconsidered "late style'' by a senior artist of unbounded imaginative potential. We find them familiarly preserved as a pair of medium-size bronze plaquettes, although (like the contemporaneous Apollo) they were very probably invented as semiprecious stone-carvings. Their squarish fields are filled almost to the margins with massively sculptural forms, concentrating in both cases upon heroic male nudes. They present poignantly interrelated and valedictory images of a Kneeling Hercules with the Nemean Lion (fig. 44), 251 and a Pietà with the body of Christ supported on the sepulcher by the Virgin, Saint John, and an angel (fig. 4s).252 The deeply moving Hercules shows the hero in numismatic profile (the compositional scheme comes from a superb Syracusan gold coin by Kimon of the fifth century B.c.),253 his head pressed hard into the frizzled mane of the lion, who though more tightly coiled otherwise repeats his pose from Moderno s earliest version with the hero standing. Here the density and compression of the image, the controlled power of the anatomical mod- eling, and the intense yet intimate embrace of the com- battants produces a design at once of monumental force, and almost tender emotive subtlety. The apparent pendant, Moderno s last plaquette, uncoils as it were the hero from his struggle with death, christianizes him, and manifests the sadness of his sacrifice, as his body is displayed in piety by grieving companions. Yet, by the sheer force of anatomical brilliance, the powerful modeling of Moderno's last Pietà becomes, as it was intended, a potent image of living hope. The profound classicism of its Christ relates intimately to the same figure in the Flagellation , to the silver Sebastian, and to the stone Apollo; indeed a deeply carved jasper version of the Pietà254 makes it an exact parallel to Moderno's contemporary hardstone carving after Ra- phael. But the wailing Virgin and fainting Saint John infuse the best examples of the composition - as for example a silver version on a pax for Cardinal Sigismondo Gonzaga, dated 1513, in the cathedral at Mantua255 - with an ecstatic transcendence: it becomes a kind of summa of Moderno's art, with its poignant memories of Mantegna and the Bellini suffused by echoes of Giorgione and early Titian, yet with foreshadowings as well of the attention to be given it, in the still-distant future, by Paolo Veronese. The remaining plaquettes traditionally attributed to Mo- derno are in my view (following the opinions of most recent commentators) all by followers, imitators, or pasticheurs: a list of such reattributions will be found in the Appendix, following a list of Moderno's canonical works as I have been able to identify them. The family shop of which in 1512 Moderno had become head (thus causing his personal artistic inventions to cease?) was inherited by his son Giambattista Mondella (1506- c. 1572), whose profession was also fine metal-working. Mo- . derno's designs continued for some time to be reissued, as well as augmented, adapted, and further developed: there is some evidence, from their inclusion in good castings on Paduan utensils around 1530 and after (perhaps by Desi- derio da Firenze?), that a few of his. most popular matrices may have been transferred to Padua after his death. His plaquettes were widely admired and conspicuously influ- ential in the Veneto, Emilia, and Lombardy; farther afield, his designs were sketched by Dürer and Holbein, and in- corporated into French Renaissance sculpture; one of the best of them provided Michelangelo with the model of a figure for his Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel. NOTES In 1983-1985 I was assisted by Christopher B. Fulton in the inauguration of a research project to catalogue the Renaissance plaquettes at the National Gallery of Art, including those from the Kress Foundation (the former Gustave Dreyfus collection) and the Widener family (the former Oscar Hainauer collection). Fulton was succeeded in 1985-1986 by Alan C. Braddock, and in 1986-1989 by Donald J. Myers; to all three I offer my warmest thanks, for their invaluable help in compiling the dossiers on each object that have made possible the undertaking of studies such as this. These assistants have assembled principally the materials cited in the specialized literature on plaquettes; Fulton began the assembly of hitherto unreferenced art-historical parallels, and it is particularly this search for 132</page><page sequence="29">stylistic and iconographie cognates that I have continued myself. A more extensive discussion and bibliography on each individual plaquette will be offered in my forthcoming volume of the National Gallery's Systematic Catalogue. All illustrations to this paper are of works by Moderno, except fig. 32, which is noted as by Moderno and his workshop. 1. Moderno's twelve signed plaquettes are listed in Douglas Lewis, "The Medallic Oeuvre of 'Moderno': His Development at Mantua in the Circle of 'Antico','' Studies in the History of Art 21 (1987), 77-97, n. 1. That article is the first in a two-part study of the artist's medals and plaquettes (the present essay). Each should be used with reference to the other, especially to augment the oeuvre list of plaquettes, in the Appendix at- tached to this article, with the proposed oeuvre list of medals, given in Lewis, "Medallic Oeuvre of Moderno," 89-90. 2.

D. Mi. Galeazzo Mondella in. v.ONA. In my view it is a mistake to think of these as late drawings: the Silenus closely reproduces elements from the upper half of a Mantegna School engraving of the 1490s (" Virtus Combusta") attributed to Zoan Andrea, after a drawing by Man- tegna in the British Museum: Mark J. Zucker, ed., The Illustrated Bartsch, Early Italian Masters, (New York, 1980-1984), vol. 25 (in 2 vols.) 1:158 no. 16, 2:126-127. Given the close relationship between Moderno and Mantegna demonstrated in this paper, the Silenus might have been drawn almost from Moderno's first years; indeed the style of these drawings suggests that of other Venetan artists of approximately the 1480s and early 1490s. 10.

The more exact and perhaps more plausible source, of which knowledge might have reached Moderno through a Mantegnesque inter- mediary, is the archer at the extreme right of the large Saint Sebastian plaquette, attributed to Donatello's Paduan period, now in the Musée Jacquemart- André in Paris: Alan Phipps Darr, ed., Donatello e i suoi [exh. cat., Fortezza del Belvedere, Florence] (Detroit, Milan, and Florence, 1986), 163-164, no. 49, and pl. XX. 19. A two-panel Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian in Berlin, once attributed to Dürer in c. 1489, but more recently to Baldung at a later date, seems to be derived in part from drawings by the Housebook Master (Giorgio Zampa, L'opera completa di Dürer (Milan, 1968), 89, no. 8 A and B): it shows archers in a similar attitude, and even similar headdress, to Moderno's. 20.

Zucker, Illustrated Bartsch, 2:220-221, no. 2508.073: this (another unique sheet, in the Rothschild collection at the Louvre) is actually a newly designed image, though its quite radical differences from the version in Pavia seem never to have been described. 27. The most curious aspect of this double Veronese borrowing, by the eclectic Nicoletto, is that he seems to have come upon his models by both Bonsignori and Moderno only thirty years after their creation (perhaps on a trip to Verona?): Zucker dates the engraving - which he treats as a single image, for admittedly the styles of the two versions are identical - to Nicoletto's last period of c. 1515-1520. 28.

In fact Aspertini two decades later seems to have been influenced in part by Moderno's very plaquette - his drafted Christ is similarly small in proportion to his full composition - but the monochrome painting that followed his drawing corrects this discrepancy and makes his final version a more resolved and balanced design than the plaquette s: Daniela Scag- lietti, "La maturità di Amico Aspertini," Paragone 233 (July 1969), 45, n. 17, with fig. 25 (formerly Robinson collection, London, in 1894). 34.

Rossi 1984, 198: in my opinion this particular "Mantegnesque" con- nection is limited to a common depiction of two male nudes seen from the back.

The contemporaneity of the "Small Sacra Conversazione" with the signed Hercules series is demon- strated not only by style, but also by its identical size, within the limits of which it presents the novelty of a narrow double-fillet border, an element that from this point forward was to become almost a standard fixture of Moderno's plaquettes. 67.

Nicoletto's related version (Zucker, 2:248, no. 2508.113) is in my view much closer to Diirer's. 89. Walter L.

A closely related, but distinct, type presents Saint Sebastian in the same general pose but with his head cocked toward his left rather than his right shoulder: it is exemplified by Mantegna's Saint Sebastian in the Louvre (Martindale and Garavaglia, Complete Paintings of Mantegna, 108- 109, no. 56, pls. XXVII-XXX), and in such a Venetan derivation as an altarpiece of 1511 for Montagnana cathedral by Giovanni Buonconsiglio, called Marescalco, Moderno s contemporary: indeed the pondération of his figure makes it clear that he had studied this plaquette as well. 91.

Previous commentators (such as Rossi 1984, 218-220) have seen this fictive architecture as "Lombard"; it is therefore worth pointing out that the idiosyncratic capitals of its columns have exact counterparts in the cloister capitals carved by Francesco da Porlezza for Moderno s own parish church of Santa Maria in Organo in Verona (Marini, Palladio e Verona, xiv, 158), on the question of whose price Moderno was directly consulted (Rognini, "Mondella" 101-102); that Girolamo Mocetto's altarpiece in the same church displays a very closely related "freestanding" tabernacle (see n. 99 above); and that the specific form of the columnar shafts, with intermediate decorative bands or drums, appears widely in Venice itself - as for example on a tabernacle in the style of Antonio Rizzo, now in Paris (François de la Moureyre-Gavoty, Sculpture italienne, Musée Jacquemart- André (Paris, 1975), no. 116). 109.

This connection was proposed by Middeldorf 1944, 33, no. 228, and repeated by almost every subsequent commentator, though with increasing skepticism (especially by Rossi 1974, 25, no. 30; Cannata 1982, 49, no. 24; and Rossi 1984, 196, no. 37). In fact the picture is a full thirty years later than Moderno's Adoration, in a radically different early Mannerist style; and the "shared" figure of the groom that seems to have caught Middeldorf s attention, is based not on the Adoration plaquette at all, but rather on a reversal of the secondary figure from Moderno's David and a Companion with the Dead Goliath, of a decade later, c. 1504/ 1505- 147. Molinier 1886, 1:126, no. 169; Pope-Hennessy 1965, 46, no. 145 (National Gallery of Art, Kress Collection, 1957.14.291, formerly A-444.167B; a late variant with incised rustication lines in the masonry, perhaps of the seventeenth century, is also in this collection: 1957.14.292, formerly A-445.168B). 148. Cannata 1982, 49, no. 24, has commented that the presence of these little dogs in the Adoration and Presentation needs explaining. In view of Moderno's connections with the Este and Gonzaga courts in Ferrara and Mantua (where zoological exotica and iconographie arcana seem to have been equally entertained), it is worth noting that such courtly dogs as these could symbolize Charity, Love, and Friendship - all appropriate to the imagery of the Adoration - as well as Princely Rank, one of the themes of the Presentation as well: Tervarent, Attributs et symboles, 1:93-94. Alison Luchs has suggested that the dogs prefigure the eventual Mocking of Christ (see James H. Marrow, Passion Iconography in Northern Eu- ropean Art [Kortrijk, 1979], 36-43); but this seems unlikely. 149.

Feltrin, Dopo Mantegna, 56, no. 30: this altarpiece is closely related as well by its "cast" of seven mourners - one of whom, with clasped hands and upraised head, stands, as in Moderno's image, directly behind the Virgin. Another related work by the same artist is a Pietà of c. 1490-1495 in his altarpiece for Trebaseleghe: Feltrin, Dopo Mantegna, 53-54, no. 29. 162. Wittgens, Foppa, 105-106, no. XCIX, with pl. 163. Rossi 1984, 195-196, no. 37, indeed, has suggested that the Cru- cifixion might have been intended from the outset as the centerpiece to a thematic grouping of the Life of Christ series, since its subject divides the first two scenes of that set (the childhood of Christ) from the last two, with Christ's victory over death; but I feel that such a grouping would have been logistically awkward, and that Moderno may have replicated the soldier precisely to afford his patrons a thematic link with a previous image, not physically congruent with the new scene (or series). It is possible that the success of the Resurrection - which in the late 1480s would have represented a Moderno plaquette of a distinctly new size and type - may have prompted his eventual development of a Life of Christ series over the decade of the 1490s, culminating in the Entombment. 164.

At first glance their borders might appear uncharacteristically heavy, but in fact an identical molding surrounds the Prometheus (see below); the figure of Goliath exactly reverses that of the Slain Cacus so as to be seen from the left side, while that of the David is developed from the Hercules in the same plaquette - possibly with a subsequent awareness of the celebrated Bellano statuette (Darr, Donatello e i suoi, 254-256, nos. 104-105). See n. 173 below. 168. Lewis, "Medallic Oeuvre of Moderno," 86-87, with fig. 12. 169.

The molded border on the plaquette version is closely related to that on the Hercules, David, and Prometheus, and identical to that on the Orpheus. 170.

Pope-Hennessy thought there to be "some doubt as to the meaning of the inscription [which he rendered as '.M.viCTORi afvnctvs.'] and the exact significance of the relief." I owe to Professor Virginia Woods Callahan the solution to the text (.M. victor^ fvnctvs) and thus the iconography (Mars Enjoying Victory). 172.

Hind, Early Italian Engraving, 1:274, no- E.III.77; 2: pl. 453; this connection was discovered by Christopher B. Fulton. There may be a loose relationship between Moderno s Mars and the engraved figure of Roma Seated amid Trophies, by the (Bolognese?) Master I.B. with the Bird (Zucker, Illustrated Bartsch, 2:148-150, no. 2507.011); but there is no common element close enough to presuppose influence in either di- rection, and the print can only be loosely dated to the first decade of the cinquecento. It inspired eventual copies apparently by Northern engravers (Zucker, Illustrated Bartsch, 2:150-151, nos. C1-C3), as well as perhaps influencing (together with Moderno s plaquette?) a thematically related Standing Mars by Nicoletto da Modena (Zucker, Illustrated Bartsch, 2:205- 206, no. 2508.047), which is also a reversed replica of the pose of the David in Moderno s Berlin tondo just discussed (n. 167 above). 174. Christie, Manson &amp; Woods, Important Ancient Coins, London, 8 October 1985, 37, lot 110. An engraved Ornamental Panel with Trophies, probably derived in part from one of the base reliefs on the Column of Trajan, shared this feature; it is routinely given to Giovanni Antonio da Brescia at the end of the second decade (Zucker, Illustrated Bartsch, 2:366, no. 2511.043), and seems certainly to betray a knowledge of Moderno s plaquette. 175.

Degenhart and Schmitt, Jacopo Bellini, 19, 25, pl. 46: the plaquette reproduces Bellini's image verbatim, including the exact pose of the figure and even the support against which it leans, with the single modification of a more characteristically Modernesque gesture of the left forearm and hand. The source was noticed by Rossi 1974, 36, no. 48, who commented as well on a variant rendering of the same prototype (which I feel must have reached the Veneto, however, via a graphic rather than a sculptural source) in a drawing attributed to Bartolomeo Montagna: Jacob Bean and Felice Stampile, Drawings from New York Collections, I: The Italian Renaissance [exh. cat., Metropolitan Museum of Art and Pierpont Morgan Library] (New York, 1965), 26, no. 14, with pl.

The attributions of both plaquettes have been contested: Maclagan (1924, 39) observed of the Lion Hunt that "the attribution to Moderno appears probable, though not certain"; and the Battle of Cannae has frequently been attributed to the Master of Coriolanus (as for example by Pope-Hennessy), although that artist's rec- tangular version of the design is in my view quite clearly a cut-down copy of Moderno's circular one: see Lewis, "Medallic Oeuvre of Moderno," 83, and n. 40. The Cannae design on the sword of Gonzalo de Cordova himself (see Fulton's essay in this volume, fig. 21) was independently assigned to the "School of Moderno," and dated "1504 or 1505" by Helmut Nickel, LEWIS 137</page><page sequence="34">"The Battle of the Crescent," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 24 (November 1965), 116-120, fig. 10.

Hamberg, Studies in Roman Imperial Art , 179-181, pl. 41. 201. Whose attribution to Moderno, for example in its Battle of Cannae version, can be supported by its details. Both fallen soldiers express their anguish through sharply bent wrists, a standard gesture from Moderno s repertoire, and the double-plumed tails of the horses repeat that idiosyn- cratic feature from his Nessus and Dejanira plaquette: these motifs are lost or misunderstood in the Coriolanus Master's rectangular copy. That derivation also truncates the lateral framing foot soldiers, so necessary to the balance of the composition, and so essentially incorporated by Moderno in all three of these interrelated combats. 202.

Pope- Hennessy proposed to identify the subject as the Death of Hippolytus, "since the sea is represented at the base of the plaquette"; but the water shown there flows from an urn, the standard classical symbol of a river, and (as noted by Wixom 1975, no. 47) Phaeton fell into the river Eridanus. The traditional identification should therefore be retained (as subsequent commentators have done: Rossi 1974, 40, no. 15; Jolán Balogh, Katalog der ausländischen Bildwerke, 2 vols. [Budapest 1975], 1:274, n0- 415)&gt; especially since its iconography is specifically connected to Moderno's image, in exact cognates from both antiquity and the Renaissance (see nn. 209 and 211 below). 208.

A rather clumsy Renaissance or later sardonyx cameo in the Medici collection (for which the sarcophagus itself was acquired be- tween 1600 and 1640) exactly reproduces the central forms of its frontal relief, before restoration: Kris 1929, 153, no. 43, pl. 14; a bronze plaquette cast from this gem is in the Victoria and Albert Museum (Maclagan 1924, 15, and pl. I). The cameo and its plaquette reproduction (both, perhaps, of the early seventeenth century?) replace the antique relief s full figure of a river god with a gushing urn derived from Moderno's, thus demon- strating that the latter was well understood to represent the former (see n. 207 above). 210.

Once it was looted in 1797-1798 and removed from the Consiglio dei Dieci in 1803/1804 (Gallo, "Due placchette del Moderno," 75-76) the studiolo is not mentioned further, and its remnants are assumed to have been destroyed (Gallo 1952, 20). 239. Vasari 1878, 7:488-489. Moderno's paired silver reliefs were prob- ably commissioned, I believe (or, at any rate, soon incorporated), as fronts of twin doors ["silver inserts"] on the studiolo: the cabinet had a central niche for a statuette (Gallo, "Due plachette del Moderno," 73), perhaps originally Sansovino's Laocoön. 240.

The Laocoön s lack of a right arm being the reason for Braman te's competitive challenge to the four young sculptors is my own more recent suggestion. It had previously been noticed that Moderno's Flagellation shows the right arm bent close to the head, thus paralleling Antonio Lombardo's use of the model in his marble Vulcan of 1508 for Alfonso d'Este at Ferrara- as well as some of the early small bronzes, perhaps deriving from Sansovino's: Brummer, Statue Court, 107- 111, figs. 88, 98, 99. 242.

It is fully possible, however, that this picture is in fact a softened repro- duction of Moderno's plaquette - especially if it is (as currently thought) by Bacchiacca, who was born only in 1494. The traditional literature has nominated several antique sculptural sources for Moderno's tormentors, and it does seem feasible that he may have known them all through drawings, given his contacts with Antico and Falconetto, even in Northern Italy (see also n. 250 below). 243.

On the valedictory nature of the image, Molinier 1886, 1:132, no. 175, n., observed that (within the manner of his monumentally developed late style) it is a close reworking of the central images from one of Moderno's first plaquettes, his Lamentation of twenty years before (fig. 15).
