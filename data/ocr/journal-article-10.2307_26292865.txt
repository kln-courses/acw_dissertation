Some of these panels repeatedly depict two archetypes: the “weightless humans”, and the “central monster”. It seems that both acrobatic and mythological aspects similar to these early pastoral scenes may be reflected in later cultural contexts and traditions. KEY WORDS: Egypt – Western Desert – Neolithic pastoralism – Rock art – Archetype – Tradition INTRODUCTION established, any precise correlations between hydroclimatic changes, palaeodemography, cultural development, and rock During the desertification of the Sahara, larger basins filled art are not yet available. The topics – animals and humans, with lakes served as principal human refuges. In addition, static and in action – are similar through the evolution, but elevated plains and mountains such as Gilf el-Kebir, Gebel the size, style and technology of the images changed Awenat, Ennedi-Tibesti, Fezzan, Acacus or Tassili, profitted constantly: paintings, engravings, both deep and shallow, from higher precipitation rates, their escarpments were ground-off surfaces, functional traces of tool polishing, furrowed by numerous at least periodically active wadis, and grattage, picquetage a. o.

Thus, this group of coexistence of the late derivation of this style with inscriptions sites is the most narrative one in what concerns topics and of the Egyptian Old Empire. It is a good example of scenes, realistic as well as supernatural.

Looking at actual African folklore, jumping is a human figurines are distributed around.
