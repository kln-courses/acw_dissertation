<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CASE OF DECOROUS THEFT: QUEVEDO'S IMITATION OF A PETRARCHAN CANZONE There are three versions extant ofQuevedo's cancionfiinebre which, inJ. M. Blecua's monumental edition, begins 'Mire ligera nave' and is dedicated to Luis Carrillo y Sotomayor: one, first published by Gonzalez de Salas in his Parnaso (Madrid, 1648), which Blecua calls A; a second with thirteen minor variants, published in Obras de Carrillo y Sotomayor (Madrid, 16I ), which he calls B; and a third dedicated to a certain 'don Juan', written earlier than the others, but published only subsequently by Aldrete in his Tres Musas (Madrid, 1670), which he calls C. Of the modern editors, Blecua cites A as the definitive text, praising the literary quality of the alterations made to B;2 Astrana Marin had preferred the latter, claiming these changes come from the hand of Gonzalez de Salas, not Quevedo;3 Fernandez- Guerra had used C,4 which the two later editors agree to be a primitive draft. For the purposes of this study I take A to be the standard text, but will refer to variants where appropriate. An additional reason for attributing authorship of the variants between A and B to Quevedo will be suggested later. Whatever the doubts over authorship, there can be, however, no doubt over chronology: A is subsequent to B, and B to C. It is well known that Quevedo's poem is an imitation of Petrarch's canzone 'Standomi un giorno',5 though, curiously, both Blecua and the most recent editor, J. O. Crosby, fail to mention this. Apart from Crosby's explanatory notes,6 the poem has received no critical attention. This neglect derives perhaps from the generally low esteem in which Quevedo's funereal poetry is held. R. M. Price explains the absence of the funereal poetry from his anthology by saying it is 'less interesting' than the other kinds of poems.7 Blecua, in the introduction to his one-volume edition, excepts the laudatory poems to the Duque de Osuna or the great men of the Ancient World, but would draw a veil over those which are 'de puro compromiso'.8 Much has been written on Quevedo's borrowings from Petrarch in his love-poetry,9 and an article has been published on his influence on Quevedo's moral verse.10 But this poem, which forms part of a relatively neglected section of work, constitutes the most sustained imitation of Petrarch in the whole of Quevedo's poetry. Its length offers particular and unique scope for comparative stylistic analysis: where does 1 Obra poetica de Francisco de Quevedo, edited byJ. M.

Two more general questions arise. Quevedo's revisions of the poem (the variants between texts A and B) take his version further away from the original. Are these changes to be explained by fear of the charge of plagiarism? More importantly, there is an apparent incongruity in the adaptation of an amatory poem for laudatory purposes, in Quevedo's substitution of a great man for Petrarch's divine Lady. How can this be related to decorum, that is, to the fit relation of image to meaning? In other words, is it possible to identify stylistic features which might be determined by the genre of the poem and the gender of the person it celebrates? I shall discuss these problems with reference to a version of the same canzone by Luis de Le6n, 'Mi trabajoso dia',11 which I hope to establish as an intermediary between Petrarch and Quevedo and a possible source for the latter. With this comparison I hope to illuminate further the unique interest of Quevedo's version. Petrarch's canzone ends with the following couplet: Queste sei visioni al signor mio han fatto un dolce di morir desio. The six visions related in the previous six stanzas are: I. An unspecified animal ('fera gentil') torn apart by greyhounds; 2. A ship wrecked in a storm; 3. A laurel tree struck by lightning; 4. A spring of water swallowed up by a cave; 5. A phoenix which disappears; 6. A Lady bitten by a snake. Mario Praz comments on the nature of these images: In fact every stanza of'Standomi un giorno' needs only a figure to become an emblem proper, and what could be imagined nearer to the taste of the seventeenth-century than the strange phoenix of one of those stanzas?12 Quevedo's original version (C) written around the turn of the seventeenth century is proof of this attraction. The order of the images is preserved exactly, with the exception of the exchange (pace Praz!) of the phoenix for a goldfinch trapped in a net. In the two final versions (A and B) the images are reduced to four, thus: i. A ship; 2. A laurel; 3. A spring; 4. A goldfinch. Thus, although Quevedo's attraction to the canzone was such that, initially, he reproduced its format almost exactly, in his revisions he moves away from the original. Are such cases imitation or theft? In Antonio Vilanova's excellent summary of the theory of imitation in the Renaissance, we find at one extreme (in el Brocense, for example) the belief that no poet can be good unless he imitates the Ancients. Carrillo y Sotomayor himself says in his 'Libro de erudicion poetica' (published in the Obras of I6I I): 'Pues assi es, que estos [the great poets of old] . . . alcansaron el fin ultimo de los Poetas, que es la fama: luego todos que siguieron sus pisadas de la suerte que ellos, tendran igual fama con ellos.'13 The imitation of the good must necessarily produce the good. The appro- priation of whole lines was permissible to some. El Brocense, again, praises Garcilaso's use of earlier poets by way of Virgil's Homeric allusions: 'Ansi tomar a Homero sus versos y hacerlos propios, es erudicion que a pocos se comunica.'14 Such 11 Obras poeticas del maestro Fray Luis de Le6n, Volume ii, Traducciones de latin, griegoy toscano e imitaciones, edited byJ.

But, if even Quevedo's text C would be judged a case of fit imitation by some contemporary theorists, the latitude inherent in the practice of imitation is sugges- ted by comparison with the schema of Luis de Leon's version. This is much further from the original than any of Quevedo's. It has the following sequence of images: i. A field withered by drought; 2. A palace that becomes a prison; 3. A stream made of fire; 4. A dove that becomes an eagle; 5. A cruel Lady, who accepts the poet's love, only to disappear. There is thus no direct appropriation of imagery, but rather the transmutation of specific elements: the field (I) evokes the setting of Petrarch's tree; the spring of fire (3) is like Petrarch's stream swallowed up by the cave; the dove (4) refers back to the phoenix; the cruel Lady (5) recalls the gentle Lady bitten by the snake. A looser concept of imitation is also found in contemporary theorists, such as Herrera.15 There is, then, at the level of both theory and poetic practice, a freedom of movement between direct reproduction or translation of a source and transfor- matory elaboration upon it. All three texts by Quevedo are thus permissible as examples of imitation, and consequently the reason for Quevedo's subsequent revisions of text C is not to be found in fear of the charge of plagiarism. I will propose later that the revisions to text C and the divergences from Petrarch (and Luis de Leon) must be seen rather in the light of another prevailing literary principle of the Renaissance, that of decorum. The complete texts of Petrarch's original and Quevedo's version A are printed below.

In the poem as a whole Petrarch's six images plus envoi come to seventy-five lines; Quevedo's four images plus conclusion come to eighty lines. Hence one aspect of Quevedo's imitative process is expansion. Quevedo has been much praised for the laconic brevity and condensation of his verse,16 but this brevity relates particularly to the sonnets. In a more discursive verse-form, the cancidn, Quevedo permits himself the space to elaborate on the briefer motifs of his original. Quevedo's ship with its canvas 'wings' (1. 2) may not compete with Petrarch's confection of silk, gold, and ivory (I shall discuss the reason for this difference later); but while Petrarch merely states that the sky was cloudless (1. 17), Quevedo elaborates on the sun shimmering on the waves (11. 6-7). It is of interest that Genette, discussing a similar image in Tristan, suggests that the light of the sun reflected and refracted on the sea is a typically seventeenth-century motif.17 Whatever the case, the personification applied to the sun is extended to the ship. Petrarch's vessel is stowed with goods: 'carca di ricca merce onesta' (1. 18); Quevedo uses the anthropomorphic 'pregnant': 'prenada de riquezas sumas' (1. 8). Petrarch's shipwreck is tersely laconic, 'che la nave percosse ad uno scoglio' (1. 21); Quevedo's extends over four lines (11. I I-I4) and contains the forceful Latinism 'furor' and the discreet alliteration of'velas' . .. 'vientos'. The lexical identity present in the first stanzas (both poets rhyme 'nave' with 'soave/suave') continues in the next pair of stanzas with 'lauro/laurel'. Petrarch's tree merely flourishes, as does Quevedo's in texts B and C. But in Quevedo's final version it reigns proudly over the field: 'reinaba presumido' (1. 19). Likewise, Petrarch's birds are merely passive sources of the music the poet hears (1. 28), while the effect on the poet of their music and the other delights of the place is somewhat distanced by their relegation to the pluperfect tense: 'che dal mondo m'avean tutto diviso' (1. 30). The sensual pleasure of Fray Luis's locus amanus more actively incites him to linger, with an incisive preterite verb: El suave olor, la no vista belleza me convid6 a poner alli mi asiento. (11. 9-Io) Quevedo's songbirds, in a typical intensifying Classical allusion, agressively steal the mind from ever-watchful worldly cares: Que, cantando, robaban el sentido al Argos del cuidado. (11. 21-22) Petrarch, Fray Luis, and Quevedo give their springs the same sound: 'murmor- ando' (1. 39), 'murmurando' (1. 31), 'urmurando' (1. 40), respectively. But while Petrarch's stream springs from a rock ('sorgea' (1. 38)) Fray Luis's is born from it: De entre una pena dura nacia y murmurando dulcemente con su correr hacia el campo hermoso. (11. 30-32) 16 See, for example, Jose-Maria Pozuelo Yvancos, El lenguaje poetico de la lirica amorosa de Quevedo (Murcia, 1979), p. 247. 17 Gerard Genette, 'Une po6tique "structurale"?', Tel Quel, 7 (196I), I3-I9 (pp. 7-i8). 22</page><page sequence="6">578 Quevedo's Imitation of Petrarch This stream, therefore, unlike Petrarch's, animates the landscape around it. Quevedo takes the suggestions of youth ('nacia') and animation of the locus ('hacia ... hermoso') and elaborates on them. His stream is 'recien nacida' (1.49) and behaves with a childlike vitality and innocent flirtatiousness: it plays with the sand (1. 37), enamours the sky (1. 38), and distracts the river bank (1. 4). It is significant that Quevedo, like Fray Luis, omits Petrarch's singing nymphs (1. 42): Nature itself is endowed with anthropomorphic qualities, and this discreet use of personification not only permits the expansion of the source-images but also their affective intensification. Quevedo's ship, tree, and spring, rendered human, demand a more urgent response from the reader. An awareness of the poetic effect of personification is found in contemporary theorists. In Part ii of his Primus Calamus, Caramuel y Lobkowitz stresses the dual function ofprosopopeia: Cum iubent [poetae] montibus et arboribus loqui non narrant quod illi vel illae dicunt, sed qua dicerent si retenta figura et innatis passionibus informarentur anima rationali. Sunt pulchrae et utiles hae hypotheses.18 Such figures are not merely decorative ('pulchrae') but also functional ('utiles'): they enable the poet to express his meaning in a heightened form. Indeed Caramuel y Lobkowitz stresses the didactic value of this figure by comparing its use by the poet to the use of parables by Christ. Quevedo, then, does not merely expand his source material; he also intensifies its affective charge through personification. This intensification, a well-known charac- teristic of Quevedo's verse style, can also be seen in the treatment of the bird of the fourth stanza. Petrarch's phoenix is described in two lines: Una strania fenice, ambedue l'ale di porpora vestita, e'l capo d'oro. (11.49-50) Fray Luis chooses a dove and expands the pintura with conventional epithets: De blanco y colorado una paloma y de oro matizada, la mas bella y ma's blanda que se vido, me vino mansa al lado, cual una de las dos por quien guiada la rueda es de quien reina en Pafo y Gnido. (11. 40-45) This is still close to Petrarch: the scarlet and gold come directly from the original. Quevedo takes Fray Luis's major revision, the substitution of songbird for phoenix, but is obliged to reject, as will be shown below, the explicitly amatory associations of the dove. He does not use the Petrarchan colour scheme but elaborates on the pictorial associations of Fray Luis's 'matizado', which becomes 'pintado' (11. 52-58). Petrarch limits himself to a simple colour scheme. Luis de Leon makes a more general, but no more urgent appeal to the afectos with the adjectives 'bella' and 'blanda'. Quevedo's goldfinch is exceptional both visually ('ramillete') and aurally ('lisonjero', 'cantor', 'parlero'). In the introduction of the bird, therefore, as in the case of the locus amaenus and spring, Luis de Leon may have served as an intermediary between Petrarch and 18 Caramuel y Lobkowitz, Primus Calamus (Rome, I665), Epistle vi, p. I3.</page><page sequence="7">PAUL JULIAN SMITH 579 Quevedo. Fray Luis's poem both expands on the earlier poet and anticipates the more intense elaborations of the later poet. This is not to say that Quevedo is consciously alluding to Luis de Le6n, but rather that he may have drawn, perhaps unconsciously, on the details of a text with which, undoubtedly, he was very familiar, elaborating and intensifying it still further. In her study of Quevedo's notes and emendations to his copy of Gabriele Zinano's Eracleide, Michele Gendreau reveals how the very act of reading was linked for Quevedo with a desire to correct and improve the original text.19 As Quevedo was a fervent admirer and editor of Luis de Leon's work, it seems possible that a similar process of creative rivalry (as described by Vives and Herrera, above) may be at work in this case. To understand the true significance of Quevedo's imitation of Petrarch and the intensification of imagery we find in the former, the modern reader must share the mindfulness of the previous Castilian version, which Quevedo himself could not have excluded from his unconscious. 'Mal se atrevera el indocto a mirar las obras del que no lo es', warns Carrillo himself in his Libro de la erudicion poetica.20 It is advice which the modern reader should bear in mind when discussing Quevedo's learned and allusive verse. However, it has more often been the relative intensity of suggestion in Quevedo's imagery that has proved attractive to the modern reader. Commenting on the funereal sonnet 'Faltar pudo su patria al grande Osuna' (no. 223), Borges praises: La esplendida eficacia del distico: su tumba son de Flandes las Camparias y su Epitaphio la sangriente Luna. es anterior a toda interpretaci6n y no depende de ella .... En cuanto a la sangriente luna, mejor es ignorar que se trata de los turcos, eclipsados por no se que piraterias de don Pedro Tellez Gir6n.21 This wilful (albeit ironic) refusal to consider images within their signifying context can be associated with the modern love of suggestive ambiguity for its own sake: the autonomous image requires no further justification than its own existence. But, as Rosemond Tuve says, the Renaissance poet was bound by 'the requirement that images be "significant" of a coherent meaning rationally imposed by the author and rationally apprehensible by the reader'.22 Thus, meaning is apprehended through the relation of image to context. The identity of words or images is no guarantee of identical significance within different poems. Margo De Ley andJ. 0. Crosby make this point in their discussion of Quevedo's burlesque parody of two heroic romances.23 The bathetic contrast when an originally heroic text is juxtaposed with a burlesque context is readily apparent. The subtle modification when amatory material is used in a laudatory poem is less easy to grasp; the author's intention is less clear, the problem of a breach in decorum, that is, of a lack of necessary connexion between image and significance, may arise. Rosemond Tuve asserts the dual nature of decorum, transcendent and all- pervasive, but inseparable from particular context: 19 Michele Gendreau, 'Quevedo lecteur de l'Eracleide de Gabriele Zinano', in Milanges offerts a Charles Vincent Aubrun (Paris, 1975), I, 313-20. 20 Quoted in Antonio Vilanova, 'Preceptistas de los siglos xvi y xvII', in Historia general de las literaturas hispdnicas, in (Barcelona, I953), p. 645. 21J.

This is accepted by the theorists, who seldom attempt more than a general statement of principle, but who as they proceed call to account every element in poetic technique, however tiny, on these grounds of'aptness', 'decency', 'seemliness'. Discussions take cognizance of the various bases for decorum familiar from classical theory - decorum in respect to the person who speaks, of whom or what, in respect to the time, the place, the purpose. But for practical purposes, in its effect upon imagery, these more or less fall together into the general notion that the poet's images must suit the 'cause and purpose he hath in hand'.24 Such a process is evidently more subtle than the simple distinction between modes of poetic diction or literary genres, which we may associate with the term decorum. First I consider 'decorum with respect to the person who speaks'. Carrillo himself, speaking in defence of poetic difficulty, notes the differing modes in which types of men express themselves: Licito le fue al soldado y cortesano un genero de hablar diferente y no companero al del hortelano y labrador. Licito le sera al Poeta y todo, diferente genero de lenguage [sic] que el ordinario y com6n, aunque cortesano y limado, no en las palabras diferente, en la disposici6n dellas, digo en su escogimiento. (Vilanova, 'Preceptistas', p. 646) It is proper that peasant, courtier, and poet speak in a way befitting their respective positions. Does the more subtle distinction between Petrarch, the distraught lover, and Quevedo, the grieving eulogist, result in different modes of diction in their respective poems? If the status of the poetic voice may be different, what of its subject matter, decorum with respect to the person of whom or the thing of which the poet speaks? I take the true subject of the poems to be the person to whom each is dedicated, not the various images which serve to amplify the death of this person. Herrera criticizes a passage in Garcilaso's first Elegy because it is more appropriate for a woman than for the man who is the subject of the poem: No convienen mas estos versos lascivos y regalados para esta tristeza, y para la dignidad del duque de Alba, que la oraci6n de Lisias, para defensa de S6crates, que lajuzg6 por buena, pero indecente para la gravedad y estimaci6n suya. Porque como dice Aristides en una oraci6n, no conviene a la mujer noble, lo que a la deshonesta y perdida; y mucho menos a los hombres lo que a las mujeres.25 In Fray Luis's version this kind of incongruity is avoided. The poem is implicitly addressed to the cruel Lady of the final stanza, who steals the poet's heart. But Quevedo's difficulty in adapting the canzone, his awareness of the differing modes of diction appropriate for men and for women, is rendered more acute by the nature of Petrarch's original. In an audience trained in allegorical reading, the smallest details evoke not only a generalized amatory ethos, such as we find in Fray Luis's version, but also the particular circumstances of Laura's life and death. The ship is described in the lapidary imagery normally used for the Lady. The golden sails may correspond to the hair. The storm comes from the east, as did the plague which caused Laura's death.26 The laurel is inevitably read as a pun on the Lady's name. The stream is a constant in the amatory locus, often associated with the Lady or her 24 Tuve, p. 192. 25 Garcilaso de la Vegay sus comentaristas, edited by Antonio Gallego Morell, second edition (Madrid, 1972), P. 443- 26 Bezzola, Rime, pp. 512-13 (notes).</page><page sequence="9">PAUL JULIAN SMITH symbols. When Laura appears as a doe, it is between two streams (no. 190). These explicitly amatory associations would have been thought incongruous in an elegy to a man. How does Quevedo manifest that versatile adaptability that the criterion of decorum seems to require of him? A study of the Latin epitaph by Quevedo, published in the Obras de don Luis Carrillo above text B and reprinted in Menendez y Pelayo's revised version of Fernandez- Guerra's edition, suggests a shift in signifying context that could resolve the apparent incongruity. It begins: Quisquis vitae naufragio iactaris, siste, &amp; lapidem consule, &amp; ipse lapis, si siccis oculis, &amp; advorte, repentinos fati insultus.27 Like Quevedo's poem, then, the epitaph begins with the shipwreck motif. But here the motif is placed within a moral context: the passer-by is asked to pause on the stormy sea of life and meditate on the vicissitudes of human existence. Hence, to understand the function within the poem of images such as the shipwreck, I propose a new reading of them in the light of Quevedo's moral verse. The silk and gold of the ship (associated, as I have said, with the Lady) are suppressed: the shipwreck-motif is infrequent in Quevedo's love-poetry (for example, no. 454) and is more character- istic of the moral verse. The danger of the storm teaches the poet the value of spiritual devotion and the iniquity of the easy life in port (nos 32 and 57). The loss of ships within a port (the Petrarchan topos offortuna in porto) reminds us 'que castigos de la providencia divina, fuera del uso comuin, avisan la enmienda de pecados'. The over-confident man's ship is 'rica y usurera' (no. 69); its sails, the shrouds of its owner's imminent death (no. 89). The 'Sermon estoico' (no. 145) gives an unequivo- cal warning: Y no dejes la choza por la quilla pues son las almas que respira Tracia y las iras del Noto muerte en el Ponto, musica en el soto. (11. 82-86) The key-note is that of warning: 'Naufraga nave, que advierte y no da escarmiento' (no. 112). The 'rotas jarcias, parleras de su historia' of the cancidn funebre relate directly to the 'escarmentadas y deshechas | velas proas y popas' of the moral poem, no. 2 (11. 34-35). I have shown how Praz noted the emblematic nature of the stanzas of'Standomi'. If we look in Henkel and Sch6ne's compilation for emblems corresponding to the images of the poem, we find that their significance is often moral or religious. Alciati's figure of a ship in a stormy sea has the motto: Spes Proxima.28 The harbour of heaven is close at hand. The presence of the ship-motif thus inevitably suggests to the reader contemporary with Quevedo not merely the imminence of annihilation found in Petrarch, but also the castigation of human temerity found in Quevedo's moral verse. The immorality of sea-faring was a frequent topic of the period. What of the tree? The pastoral setting would seem amatory, containing as it does most of the elements Curtius deems essential to the locus amanus: grass, tree, birds, 27 Quevedo, Obras completas, edited by A.

Jahrhunderts (Stuttgart, 1967), col. 1462. 58I</page><page sequence="10">Quevedo's Imitation of Petrarch and shade.29 But the way in which these birds wrest consciousness from the formerly watchful observer (the theft which I previously identified as a typically intensified Quevedesque conceit) lends an ominous quality to the apparently innocent delight in Nature. The earth's transparent pride in the tree ('ufana') and the wind's excessive worship of the same ('adulaba') might prepare us, in the same way as does the over-confidence of the 'nave segura', for the disaster that is to come. The contemporary reader might associate the tree struck by lightning with the vengeance of a just God. I quote the heading given by Gonzalez de Salas to a religious poem by Quevedo: Dios Nuestro Sefior, cuando truenan las nubes, despierta del sueiio del pecado al alma adormecida, y con el rayo que hiere los montes solicita el escarmiento de las culpas, que le merecen mejor que los robres. (no. 183) Once more, escarmiento is the key-word. The tree is a vehicle for the angry voice of God, which would blast our sins: Ofensas, y no robres, son despojos de cefio ardiente del mejor zafiro; y sabe el cielo hablar por sus enojos. (11. I i-i4) The laurel in particular has a precise moral significance. The figure of a laurel undamaged by lightning is given the motto Intacta virtus by Camerarius.30 The amatory, pastoral ambience apparently continues in the next stanza, devoted to the stream. Indeed, this motif is extremely frequent in Quevedo's love-poetry, the words fuente and r'o in singular and plural forms occurring no fewer than seventy- eight times. In typical love-poems, the lover orders the stream to run more slowly out of respect for his grief (no. 319), or complains that since his Lady left he no longer understands the river's babbling (no. 351). In a sonnet closer in theme to the present poem, he compares its passage through 'grutas tenebrosas sedientas' to the forced dissimulation of his tears (no. 347). The amatory topic of the tears which serve to swell a river is used extensively in the love-poems (for example, nos. 318, 362, 400) and is indeed alluded to in the final two lines of the stanza of'Mire ligera nave': cuya corriente breve restauraron ojos que de piadosos la lloraron. But it is also found in a religious poem: dCuando mis tristes ojos, vueltos rios a tu mar llegaran desde este yermo? (no. I5) Taurellus's emblem of a spring flowing into the sea ('Sordes adquirit, et auffert') is a similar image of final immersion or extinction.31 The answer to the poet's anguished exclamation is, of course, that only after death will the rivers of tears reach the oblivion of the divine ocean. The seductive virtuosity of the 'parlero cristal', which entrances Nature with its sensual beauty, might have 29 E. R. Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, translated by W. R.

The well-known equation of the course of a river and the life of a man (for example, no. 29) must colour the reader's perception of a superfically pastoral and amatory context. This is not to deny that these moral overtones are entirely absent in Petrarch's amatory elegy (indeed, D. Gareth Walters has shown that the moral dimension of other poems of the Canzoniere held a particular attraction for Quevedo).32 It is rather to note a relative difference in emphasis, deftly and economically brought about by Quevedo. To sum up: Quevedo's elaboration of Petrarch's vignettes is not decorative, but functional: the poem could not have been dedicated to Carrillo without this subtle translation of imagery from one mode to another. Thus, in all three examples (ship, tree, spring) Quevedo assimilates the Petrarchan love-topics by subtly colouring them with the conventional associations discovered in his own moral verse. Moreover, this transformation takes effect precisely at those points where, as I have shown, Quevedo (or Gonzalez de Salas, if we follow Astrana Marin) expands and intensifies the original motifs through personification. The ship is complacent, the tree proud, the stream flirtatious, to distinguish them from the more overtly lyrical and pathetic images of Petrarch, which are given only conventional epithets. Blecua bases his case for Quevedo's authorship of all of text A on the literary skill revealed: 'Las pocas variantes que arrojan entre si los textos B y A demuestran que el texto de B ha sido habilmente retocado.'33 I would suggest an additional reason for attesting the skill of the emendator: the only substantial revisions occur at those same points where it is vital to stress the anthropomorphic vanity, and consequent affective intensity, of the central images if the poem is to be interpreted within a moral ethos. The neutral 'florecido' is replaced by the loaded 'presumido' (1. 19) and the arboreal 'hojas' with the potentially human 'adorno' (1. 23). The tree is first disturbed by the wind ('inquietaba'); later it is flattered ('adulaba' (1. 25)). The goldfinch's predicament is intensified in the elegant bimembracidn 'en lastimero son, en triste llanto', which replaces the less urgent 'bien que contra razon, en triste llanto'. The revisions of B, then, continue the progressive movement away from the Petrarchan plangency of text A and its further association with the moral topos of the vanity of human pride. As it is accepted that Quevedo wrote text B, it seems perverse to ascribe to another the authorship of details consistent with both the original emendations (the differences between C and B) and the true purpose of Quevedo's imitation. What is more, the key-words in the emendations occur elsewhere in Quevedo's verse. In the love-poetry alone there are three occurrences of'presumido' (no. 32, 1. 8; no. 424, 1. 55; no. 43, 1. 5), one of'adorno' (no. 399, 1.44), and one of the verb 'adular' (no. 402, 1. 7 ):34 Astrana attributes none of these to Gonzalez de Salas. I have noted Quevedo's emendations of Zinano; there is no doubt that he applied the same evaluative criteria to his own work.35 With text A, Quevedo further animates his images, making them literally articulate: 'parlerasjarcias'; 'jilguero parlero'; 'parlero cristal'. They can thus voice 32 D.

The epitaph puts it in laconic style: 'Vita brevis, gloria fallax, salus dubia, cura edax, divitiae infidae, vana nobilitas, peritura fama, hominibus ludunt.'36 In the light of this moral concern, the other omissions and transformations which Quevedo makes to his original are fully illuminated. He is scrupulous in rejecting all that does not befit his subject, and in signalling to the more alert seventeenth- century reader from the very beginning the context in which the images are to be interpreted. Why does Quevedo reject Petrarch's first stanza in his later versions? The suppression of the first stanza enables the ship to take a prominent position at the start of the poem; this is relevant when we remember that Carrillo was a naval officer, 'Cuatralbo de las Galeras de Espafia'. In addition, the 'fera gentil' torn to pieces by hounds perhaps suggested a passivity unseemly in a man. Certainly the rejection in A and B of the last Petrarchan visione, the Lady bitten by a snake, present in modified form in Fray Luis's version, must be prompted by a belated realization of its unseemly incongruity; it does occur in the poem to Don Juan, a rough draft of the later versions. The use of the goldfinch is perhaps, as I have suggested, prompted by Fray Luis's dove. Certainly, the bird in a net has a biblical antecedent, particularly apt in a funereal poem: 'Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is broken, and we are delivered' (Psalm I24.6). The goldfinch itself has complex religious association in devotional art. Herbert Friedmann discerns five related categories of meaning: resurrection; recovery from illness; redemption and immortality, the former being the first step towards the latter; sacrifice and the Passion; death itself.37 All but the second of these associations are appropriate for Quevedo's purpose and must subtly colour the reader's perception of the image. On the other hand, the suppression of the phoenix (echoed by Fray Luis) may be in response to formal considerations. The phoenix unambiguously denotes rebirth, and signals (in Petrarch) a premature and partial return to two of the previous images, the tree and the stream. Although Quevedo hints at the possibility of resurrection in the figure of the goldfinch, he delays the explicit promise of rebirth to a more emphatic position in the final stanza. In a brisk and wittily condensed example of Summationsschema he proclaims the immortality of each image in turn, finally and unambiguously asserting their moral-religious ethos and decorous appearance within a laudatory poem (11. 69-76). The ship reaches port as the soul reaches God; the laurel, which had originally seemed the image most intractably linked to the beloved Laura, becomes a wreath, fitting honour for a great man; the stream flows to Grace through the desert of earthly life (a striking parallel with the religious poem already mentioned (no. 12)); the songbird becomes a seraph as the man an angel. The last four lines assert the irrationality of grief when eternal life is certain: why weep for Don Luis (now named for the first time) when all will find satisfaction in the afterlife? This proposition is couched in an unusually intricate example of rapportatio: ansi que el que a don Luis llora no sabe que, pajaro, laurel y fuente y nave 36 Fernandez-Guerra and Menendez y Pelayo (see note 27), I, 176. 37 Herbert Friedmann, The Symbolic Goldfinch: Its History and Significance in European Devotional Art (Washington, D.C., 1946), quoted by W.

(11. 77-80) This could not be further from Petrarch's carefully understated and apparently transparent final lines: Canzon, tu puoi ben dire: - Queste sei visioni al signor mio han fatto un dolce di morir desio. The ending of each poem displays in abbreviated form the profound divergences of the two. If, as Praz claims,38 it is Petrarch's emblematic allegories that attracted seventeenth-century readers, Quevedo's witty intensification of those very symbols, and his assimilation of them to a moral tradition, strip the originals of the plangent, elegiac tone so typical of Petrarch, substituting for it a more rigorous, yet less moving, tone. The inexorable correspondences of the final twin polysyndeton denote an observer as willing as Petrarch to draw general significance from the particular, but less prone to sentimental reverie. Both invoke the Stoic topos of brevitas vitae, but to different effect. For Petrarch the transience of beauty provokes a longing for death, and he is echoed by Fray Luis in his final lines: Canci6n, estas visiones ponen en mi encendida ansia de fenecer mi triste vida. Once more, Quevedo is the exception. For him, the chimera of worldly status provokes a reaffirmation of the value of eternal life. In both versions of the poem, the reader (like the poetic voice) is, in a twin movement, first seduced by sensual beauty, then disabused by human mortality. But while Petrarch inspires pathos, Quevedo would teach desengano. One seeks primarily to move the emotions, the other to convince the intellect. In Gonzalez de Salas's Parnaso, text A is placed in the section belonging to the third Muse, 'Melpomene'. Opposite an engraving of the Muse seated in glory, with crowns and sceptres strewn on the ground, there is a quotation attributed to Seneca: Dies iste, quem tanquam Extremum | reformidas, AEterni Natalis est. I Interea tamen scies, magnorum | Virorum, non minus Praesentia, I esse utilem Memoriam.39 Laudatory poetry thus has a didactic function ('utilem') in promoting remem- brance of a great man, and Quevedo shows that his reader can learn as much from his subject's death as from his deeds while alive. The difference in tone, then, between Quevedo and Petrarch derives not merely from the divergent periods, personalities, and languages of the two poets, but rather from the differing imperatives to which the imagery is subordinated. Petrarch's lachrymose lament might be unseemly if provoked by the death of Don Luis Carrillo y Sotomayor. Quevedo does not seem to find this uncompromising concep- tismo appropriate for Lisi; a genuine love-poem in morte (such as no. 492) is very different indeed. If the decorous relation of image and meaning explains Quevedo's omissions and transformations, it also illuminates the underlying seemliness in the confrontation of 38 Praz, p. 14. 39 Quevedo, El parnasso espanfoly musas castellanas, edited by Gonzalez de Salas (Madrid, 1650), p. IoI.</page><page sequence="14">586 Quevedo's Imitation of Petrarch amatory and laudatory. Both poems are, of course, provoked by a death: the elegy is a unique link between the two modes. But at a more profound level, the two subjects have equal status in relation to the poet. The praises of Lady and great man are equally hyperbolic in their respective worlds. The two associations of laurel, love and glory, to which I have already drawn attention, are not fortuitous. Likewise, the conventional identification of Love and Death reinforces the parallel. In Quevedo's own work we might compare: La Muerte, que ambiciosa en monarquia universal no admite compaiia ... (no. 278,11. 27-28) No admiten, no, Floralba, compafiia Amor y Majestad ... (no. 324, 11. -2) Love and Death are both absolute, united by the power they hold over their victims. Hence the consciousness of explicit Petrarchan allusion, which Quevedo must have assumed in an educated readership, far from diminishing his cancion enriches its theme through the discreet, implied parallelism between Lady and hero. The poem is infused with undertones of the expressive pathos inevitably invoked by allusion to the Italian master. Carrillo's final apotheosis is implicitly enhanced, no less than that of Fray Luis's Lady, by the semi-divine status of Laura. A constant mindfulness of the original while reading the cancion would indeed lead to incongruity, but an unselfconscious awareness of the Petrarchan topoi, such as the seventeenth-century reader would have, enforces the poetic effect. It is this sensibility which Quevedo exploits for his own particular purpose. An awareness of the fundamentally allusive nature of Quevedo's verse40 suggests a more general observation on the nature of originality in Renaissance poetics. The conventional nature of these images, their occurrence in a variety of authors, suggests that despite the seventeenth-century cult of the strange and the marvellous, the true index of creativity does not lie in some quality inherent in the image itself, for without a referential context it is devoid of significance. Originality is to be found first of all in the mode of expression in which the image is couched. This I have tried to illuminate through stylistic analysis. But this style, however peculiar to an individual poet, does not derive merely from idiosyncratic psychological traits. It is also determined to a large extent by the poet's awareness of the kind of poem he is writing and the context within which he wishes the readers to interpret it. Thus, there is in operation a constant and dynamic dialectic between image and meaning, which enables a limited repertoire of images to articulate a broad and subtly- coloured variety of meaning. My examination of'Standomi un giorno' and 'Mire ligera nave' has revealed that decorum could operate in a manner not prescriptive and reductive but, rather, vital and enriching; that the imitation of previous models could be, not a dull and slavish copy, but an imaginative appropriation of poetic substance. The moral preoccupa- tion revealed beneath the formal topics makes 'Mire ligera nave' a poem highly 40 See Close, p. 855.</page><page sequence="15">PAUL JULIAN SMITH 587 characteristic of its author.41 Quevedo's skill in transposing these topics from one mode to another makes him a typical poet of the Renaissance.42 Postscript After this article was sent to the printers, I was informed of Professor Alicia de Colombi's work on Hispanic imitations of this Petrarchan canzone. In 'Las visiones del Petrarca en el Barroco espafiol' (Nueva Revista de Filologza Hispdnica, 28 (1979), 287-305), some ten pages (pp. 289-99) are devoted to Quevedo's version. Professor Colombi stresses the relative depersonalization of both poetic voice and subject matter. She also praises Quevedo's skill in adapting his original: 'El poeta ha tomado cada figura y la ha acomodado a una realidad muy distinta a la de Laura' (p. 229). She does not, however, mention the principle of decorum, which I take to be essential in this process. A subsequent article by the same author (NRFH, 29 (1980), 151-64) refers to an imitation of Quevedo's version. TRINITY HALL, CAMBRIDGE PAULJULIAN SMITH 41 See Price, p. 8: 'An account of Quevedo's poetry from the point of view of the subjects he treated must bear in mind therefore both the formal topics and the underlying moral preoccupation which is the central motive of his poetry.' 42 See Tuve, p. 240: 'How adept were these poets in transposing themes from key to key, with corresponding shifts in tone and what one might term the pitch of the images.'
