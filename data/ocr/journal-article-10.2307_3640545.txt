<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics. By Lisa Mighetto. (Tucson, University of Arizona Press, 1991. xiv + 177 pp. $35 cloth, $17.95 paper) The subject of this book is the social construction of animals. With great conciseness, yet without sacrificing the actual voices of those who have spoken for animals in American life, Lisa Mighetto reviews not only the inconsistencies we have inherited, but also the rapid development of our popular ideas. One finds so many attitudes here, and voiced by so many speakers-informed and uninformed-that finally one is tempted to conclude that American attitudes toward animals have not revealed so much what they are, but have revealed what we are, and the way we value ourselves, as domestic and wild beings. The strength of this exposition is in its sources. The author makes very few judgments herself, but allows the sources to speak. She reveals a set of arguments which finally converge on the two attitudes labelled, for historical reasons, "biocentric" and "anthropo- centric," but which overlap with two preoccupations of animal protectors. One group is epitomized by Peter Singer, preoccupied with the individual animal, and focuses on sentience, while the other group, epitomized perhaps by Aldo Leopold and which grew increasingly strong with the influence of evolution and early ideas of "ecology," is interested in preserving species diversity. Yet this matrix of arguments and preoccupations overlap, as the author is at pains to show, in actual persons and in our culture itself. There are no easy dualities here. Mighetto indicates from the beginning that all discussions of</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 115 the protection of animals must begin with human motivations, and with the sources of value, whether these are to be seen as pragmatic or intrinsic. And she argues convincingly that Americans have learned about animals not from dispassionate scientific discussions but from arguments used to protect animals. This book does not offer a "correct" argument for the protection of animals. Neither does it confront rapidly changing conceptions of zoology and ecology (for instance, the "value" of predators in discussions by "new ecologists" like Daniel Botkin, in Discordant Harmonies, pp. 78-80). Though all human discussions must be human-"biocentric" arguments are only less anthropomorphic--the author indicates that "Despite the forma- tion of new rationales for protecting animals, current studies reveal that utilitarianism is still the strongest of incentives" (p. 118). This leaves us with the following paradox: Up to the present, the most sophisticated discussions of the value of wild animals have been the least effective, and the most effective arguments for the protection of wild animals have been least defensible in their scientific accuracy or philosophical integrity. (Meanwhile, as the author concludes, species are disappearing faster than we are getting to know them.) Southern Utah University MICHAEL PETER COHEN</page></plain_text>
