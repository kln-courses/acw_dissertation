GASKIN Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Dublin THE DESIGN ARGUMENT: HUME'S CRITIQUE OF POOR REASON In an article in Philosophy (I968, pp. I99-2II) R. G. Swinburne set out to argue that none of Hume's formal objections to the design argument 'have any validity against a carefully articulated version of the argument' (p. I 99) . This, he maintained, is largely because Hume's criticisms 'are bad criticisms of the argument in any form' (p. 206). The ensuing controversy between Swinburne and Olding' has focused upon the acceptable/unacceptable aspects of the dualism presupposed in Swinburne's defence of the design argument; upon whether any simplification is achieved by reducing scientific explanation to agent explanation; and upon the problems which arise from taking a man's acting upon his body (or the material universe within his reach) as the analogy for understanding a disembodied agent acting upon matter. In this article I shall refer to the Swinburne-Olding controversy when appropriate but my main concern is to return to Swinburne's original article and argue, seriatim, that Hume's individual criticisms of the design argument are for the most part a great deal more powerful than Swinburne allowed. I shall contend that cumulatively they destroy the design argument as any sort of rational foundation for theistic belief. But first I shall indicate briefly the character of the argument together with one or two of the distinctions and refinements in terms of which it has been found helpful to carry on the discussion in recent years. I. TERMINOLOGY AND FORMULATIONS In I 75 1, when Hume was first working on the Dialogues,2 he wrote to a friend 'I cou'd wish that Cleanthes' Argument [the design argument] coud be so analys'd as to be render'd quite formal and regular'. But this is a difficult thing to do. The version which he eventually gave to Cleanthes is this: The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, 1 The four articles are: R. G. Swinburne, 'The Argument from Design', Philosophy (1968); A. Olding, 'The Argument from Design - a Reply to R. G. Swinburne', Religious Studies (I97I); Swinburne, 'The Argument from Design - a Defence', Religious Studies (I972); Olding, 'Design - a Further Reply to R. G. Swinburne', Religious Studies (I 973) .

Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed (Dialogues, I43). John Stuart Mill suggests an equally careful and somewhat similar formu lation of the argument: Certain qualities, it is alleged, are found to be characteristic of such things as are made by an intelligent mind for a purpose. The order of Nature, or some con siderable parts of it, exhibit these qualities in a remarkable degree. We are entitled, from this great similarity in the effects, to infer simnilarity in the cause, and to believe that things which it is beyond the power of man to make, but which resemble the works of man in all but power, must also have been made by Intelligence, armed with a power greater than human (Three Essays on Religion, 4th ed., London I875, p. I67). The design argument is thus an argument from analogy. It is also empirical in the straightforward sense that it appeals to observed similarities between artifacts and works of nature. Swinburne expresses the formal pattern of the argument thus: Our argument thus proves... to exemplify a pattern common in scientific in ference. As are caused by Bs. A*s are similar to As. Therefore - given that there is no more satisfactory explanation of the existence of A*s - they are produced by B*s similar to Bs. B*s are postulated to be similar in all respects to Bs except in so far as the dissimilarities between As and A*s force us to postulate a difference (Swinburne, 205). Of these three formulations, Mill's is the one which most clearly permits the design argument to appear in either of two distinct but closely related ver sions. His 'certain qualities' can be either the order or the purpose to be found in the natural world. If order is taken as the feature of nature in stating the argument, then what I shall call the Regularity Argument results: the orderly and regular workings of the solar system, like the orderly working of a traffic system, come about by the design of some rational agent. They are neither 'brute facts' incapable of further explanation nor are they attributable to 'chance'. If purpose is the feature of nature used in stating the argument then what I shall call the Teleological Argument results: the camera and the human eye have striking similarities of structure; the camera was made by an intelligent being for a purpose; therefore the purpose which the eye fulfils was also given it by an intelligent being. The analogy in this version of the design argument is almost always between natural objects and things made to serve a purpose; scarcely ever between the workings of the natural world and human purposive actions.</page><page sequence="3">HUME AND THE DESIGN ARGUMENT 333 But the teleological argument is vulnerable to any scientific advance (such as Darwin's theory of natural selection) which might show that the ap pearances of purpose in nature are explainable by reference to the operation of laws which have no foresight of the ends to be achieved.1 The regularity argument is not vulnerable in this way. It could be argued that every advance in the natural sciences which displays another or more general law-governed aspect of the universe is further evidence in its support. The more successful the natural sciences become, the less plausible it looks to say 'all this came by chance alone' and the less intellectually satisfactory it is to say 'the regu larities which science discovers are ultimate brute facts about the way things are'. As Swinburne and others have pointed out, the regularity argument offers an ultimate agent explanation of why things are as science finds them to be. My subdivision of the design argument into a regularity argument and a teleological argument comes very close to T. McPherson's distinction between 'design - A' and 'design - B' (see The Argument from Design, London I 97 1, p. 8). Swinburne's distinction (p. 2oo) between regularities of succession or temporal order ('simple patterns of behaviour of objects', e.g. Newton's law of gravitation) and regularities of co-presence or spatial order ('patterns of spatial order at some one instant of time', e.g. a town plan) is devised in a slightly different way. But the teleological argument would very largely be expressed by reference to regularities of co-presence and the regularity argument by reference to regularities of succession. Both the regularity argument and the teleological argument fit Swinburne's schema. Mill clearly allows for both, but in the passage quoted Hume ap pears to state only the teleological argument. However, in other places in the Dialogues he speaks of 'the order and arrangement of nature' and in the Natural History of Religion (sect. 2) he refers to the being 'who bestowed exis tence and order on this vast machine and adjusted all its parts, according to one regular plan or connected system'. In fact Hume does not usually dis tinguish between the two sub-arguments within the design argument. What he does do is to provide criticisms of immense subtlety and penetration which either apply to both sub-arguments, or which apply primarily to the more enduring regularity argument. These criticisms I shall now explore. For the sake of this article, I shall take it that Hume in the Dialogues is any speaker who appears to be making a good philosophical point and I shall treat the Enquiry,2 sect. xi, and the Dialogues as a continuous body of philosophical 1 Although Hume does not have the theory of natural selection at hand he does make a suggestion which comes remarkably close to anticipating the theory as an objection to the teleological argument: 'It is in vain, therefore, to insist upon the uses of the parts in animals or vegetables, and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain know how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted? Do we not find, that it immediately perishes whenever this adjustment ceases, and that its matter corrupting tries some new form?'

I shall speak of 'the design argument' whenever it is unnecessary to distinguish between the two sub-arguments. II. HUME S CRITIQUE The Dialogues and the Enquiry taken together contain a large number of criticisms of the design argument. I now consider seriatim some of the more important of these. IA. If the gods are the cause of order in the universe, then they posess that degree of power, intelligence and benevolence which appears in their known effect (the world) and nothing more (Enquiry, I45 et seq.). Hume expresses the bones of this criticism in two sentences in the Enquiry which I shall denote P1 and P2. P1 When we infer any particular cause from an effect, we must proportion the one to the other and can never be allowed to ascribe to the cause any qualities but what are exactly sufficient to produce the effect (Enquiry, I45). P2 If the cause be known only by the effect, we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the effect; nor can we, by any rules ofjust reasoning, return back from the cause and infer other effects from it, beyond those by which alone it is known to us (Enquiry, 146; my italics). Thus, for example, if we find in a junk shop a painting of an arcadian land scape, we can confidently conclude that its origin lies in the activity of an artist, and from what we know about human beings we can infer that the artist had a body temperature of approximately 98.40 F. But from the arca dian landscape, we cannot conclude that the artist was also an architect who kept bees. In general, we can know more about a cause than that it is just sufficient to produce a given effect when we know what kind of thing the cause is. But in the case of arguing from the world to a god, we are not, it is to be assumed, already familiar with what gods are like and, if our inspection of the world suggests a designer of limited power who is indifferent to human welfare, we cannot then conclude that he is a god of infinite power concerned with human good. Itwill be noticed that this consideration does not invalidate the design argument. It only restricts its conclusion to what can actually be inferred from the phenomena. Swinburne (p. 207) comments here: 'the universal adoption of this cele brated principle [P1] would lead to the abandonment of science. Any scientist who told us only that the cause of E had E-producing characteristics would not add an iota to our knowledge. Explanation of matters of fact consists in postulating on reasonable grounds that the cause of an effect has certain characteristics other than those sufficient to produce the effect.' But Hume would be in complete agreement with all this as is shown, for example, by his comments (Dialogues, I62-3) on the unsatisfactory character of explana</page><page sequence="5">HUME AND THE DESIGN ARGUMENT 335 tions which have recourse to faculties or occult qualities in accounting for effects. The important question to settle is when am I in the common situation (which Swinburne characterizes) of knowing more about a cause than that it is just sufficient to produce a given effect, and when am I in the special situation (which Hume states in P2) of knowing the cause only through its effects? Hume's answer is that I am in the special situation when the cause is the only one of its kind as far as I can know. Thus when I infer the cause of something to be a human agent I am in the common situation and I can at once infer other human-type activities in the cause because I know from experience what humans are like and what they can do: 'man is a being whom we know by experience' (Enquiry, I52). On the other hand with the cause of the regularities in the world I am in the special situation. This cause is unique, as far as I can know, and is known to us only from the given effect: The Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a single being in the universe, not comprehended under any species or genus, from whose experienced attributes or qualities we can, by analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him (Enquiry, I53). It will be noticed that Hume does not propose the universal adoption of the principle P1 since it describes an inference pattern which is immediately qualified in his remarks by P2. Swinburne's comment misses this point. Hume is himself very much alive to the dangers of mixing up the common and the special situations. If you saw a half-finished house (Enquiry, I51-2) would you not infer that it was a work of intelligent contrivance and that it would be completed? Likewise if you saw one human footprint in the sands would you not infer that there had been another? Why then when you see a world displaying very great signs of contrivance but falling short of perfection do you hesitate to infer that its cause is limitlessly good and powerful, or that the world is moving towards perfection? Because in the former case you know what finished houses are like, and that they are designed, and you know that human beings generally have two legs. This is the common situation. But in the latter case the degree of completeness of the world is not known by com parison with anything else like it and neither is the power and perfection of its cause. This is the special situation. What 'the religious philosophers' are tacitly assuming, as Hume points out, is that they do know more about God than the design argument could estab lish if it were valid. In particular they claim that God has moral attributes and these cannot be established by the design argument. Indeed the situation is worse: iB. If the design argument is valid then the existence of natural evil in the world is evidence against God having the moral characteristics attributed to him in theistic religions (Dialogues, I93-2I3).</page><page sequence="6">336 J. C. A. GASKIN What I here distinguish as a separate criticism of the design argument is clearly a particular and very important application of the first. Swinburne dismisses it: 'this does not affect the argument from design which, as Clean thes admits, does not purport to show that the designer of the Universe does have these characteristics'. I do not know where Cleanthes is supposed to admit this. The entire discussion in the Dialogues takes place within the agreed assumption that 'the question is not concerning the being but the nature of God' (Dialogues, I4I; see also I28) and in sections x and xi, where the problem of natural evil is being discussed, Cleanthes makes it very clear that he does wish to establish the moral attributes of the Deity from the observed character of the world: If you can make out the present point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or corrupted, there is an end at once of all religion. For to what purpose establish the natural attributes of the Deity, while the moral are still doubtful and uncertain? (Dialogues, I99). Cleanthes' question is not merely rhetorical. It poses a vitally important restriction on the sort of conclusion which might be established by the design argument. There is a world of difference between an argument which might establish the moral character of the designer and an argument which leads to Philo's bleakly alien god: The true conclusion is, that the original source of all things is entirely indifferent to all these principles, and has no more regard to good above ill than to heat above cold (Dialogues, 212). This is not the context in which to embark upon a discussion of the problem of evil. Philo concedes that the problem of evil might be solvable: that the facts of the world might be shown to be consistent with the presumption of divine benevolence and omnipotence (especially if talk about infinite attributes is dropped). What he does not concede (and I do not see how such a concession could be defended) is that the facts of the world could them selves be used as evidence from which to infer divine benevolence and omnipotence. It is Hume's contention that the savage, predatory and wasteful economy of nature is alone sufficient to prevent us inferring the benevolence of the designing intelligence unless we give 'benevolence' a new meaning quite at variance with the normal. As Mill wrote more passionately: Not even on the most distorted and contracted theory of good which ever was framed by religious or philosophical fanaticism, can the government of Nature be made to resemble the work of a being at once good and omnipotent (op. cit. p. 38). Thus if the design argument indicates the existence of some gigantically intelligent and powerful agent, it also indicates the amoral character of that agent. If we argue from world to god, we arrive at 'nothing but the idea of a blind nature' (Dialogues, 2II) or at a power which has 'no more regard to</page><page sequence="7">HUME AND THE DESIGN ARGUMENT 337 good above ill than to heat above cold'. As Philo and Demea both agree, the order of nature is not such as to provide evidence of the power and benevo lence of its cause. 2A. The analogy between those objects known to proceedfrom design and any natural object is too weak and remote to suggest similar causes (many locations in the Dialogues and Enquiry). Swinburne concedes that 'if there is a weakness in the argument it is here that it is to be found' but he refuses to assess the weakness since it is perhaps more a task 'for the preacher and the poet than for the philosopher' (Swin burne, 2II: see also Swinburne's Reply, p. 203). But this will not do in the context of his generalization that Hume's criticisms are 'bad criticisms of the argument in any form'. The central and most strongly urged criticism which Hume presents is that the analogy is hopelessly weak. In assessing the design argument it seems quite artificial to ignore this criticism because it is not 'formal' in Swinburne's terminology. I shall later agree with Swinburne that some of Hume's formal criticisms are weak. But this one is powerful, and not to be brushed aside. Swinburne's schema for the sort of analogical argument which the design argument exemplifies (quoted above, p. 332) may be stated thus: As are caused by Bs A*s are similar to As Therefore A*s are caused by B*s where B*s are similar to Bs 'except in so far as the dissimilarities between As and A*s force us to postulate a difference' between B*s and Bs (Swinburne, 205; see also Swinburne's Reply, p. I98). Thus: artifacts are caused by human agents: natural objects are similar to artifacts; therefore natural objects are caused by non-human agent(s) similar to human agents except in so far as the dissimilarities between artifacts and natural objects force us to postulate a difference. My difficulty with this formulation is that the statement 'A*s are similar to As' omits reference to the main element characteristic of argument by analogy. 'How good an analogy is there?' we ask, meaning: 'How close a similarity is there between the objects compared?' Swinburne does of course allow for this question in his concluding qualification: B*s are similar to Bs 'except in so far as the dissimilarities between As and A*s force us to postulate a difference'. But analogical arguments are not usually set up by conceding similarity and then noting differences after the conclusion has been reached. They are set up by establishing explicit points of similarity in the analogy and countered by disputing whether the similarities hold or are of sufficient im portance relative to the dissimilarities. Thus it would seem desirable that the schema for analogical argument should allow the points of similarity between the objects to be stated: objects are similar with respect to certain features which I2 RES I2</page><page sequence="8">338 J. C. A. GASKIN have to be specified if the similarity is challenged. A way in which this could be done in Swinburne's schema is as follows: As are caused by Bs A*s are similar to As in features x1, X2, .. ., Xn Therefore A*s are caused by B*s where B*s are as similar to Bs as the number and relative magnitudes of xl to xn allow us to suppose. Thus the analogy would be weak if either n were a very small number or if the magnitude of any particular x found in association with A*s were very different from the magnitude of the same x found in association with As. Thus the analogy between an orange and a planet is so weak that no one would think of using it in order to postulate similar causes. Why? Because the only feature of similarity is sphericity (n = i) and the magnitude of this feature in the objects compared is vastly different. Now it is Hume's frequent and emphatically repeated contention that the degree of similarity between artifacts and natural objects is exceedingly slight both with respect to the number of features they have in common and with respect to the magnitude of those features which they do have in common. The dissimilitude is so striking, that the utmost you can here pretend to is a guess, a conjecture, a presumption concerning a similar cause (Dialogues, 144). And again: All the new discoveries in astronomy, which prove the immense grandeur and magnificence of the works of nature ... become so many objections, by removing the effect still farther from all resemblance to the effects of human art and con trivance (Dialogues, I65). Put in this way the criticism needs neither defence nor elaboration. Anything whatever manmade is exceedingly unlike the universe at large; so unlike that Hume is moved to suggest that the cause of the universe must be beyond understanding by any possible analogy: But this method of reasoning [from analogy] can never have place with regard to a being so remote and incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper (Enquiry, 155). But it could be argued that the analogy is not between artifacts and the universe at large. In the teleological argument the analogy is between the purpose to be found in both natural objects and artifacts and in the regularity argument it is between the order to be found in both. Thus the design argu ment should read 'Artifacts are caused by human agents. Natural objects are similar to artifacts in displaying the features of order and/or purpose. There fore natural objects are caused by non-human agents etc.' But this, as Hume points out, is to make the analogy incredibly weak. The features of similarity named are only two (or one if we assume that the theory of natural selection</page><page sequence="9">HUME AND THIE DESIGN ARGUMENT 339 has devalued the teleological argument) and the magnitude in which the feature(s) occur in artifacts and natural objects is almost ludicrously different: Admirable conclusion! Stone, wood, brick, iron, brass have not, at this time, in this minute globe of earth, an order or arrangement without human art and contrivance: Therefore the universe could not originally attain its order and arrangement, without something similar to human art (Dialogues, I49). It is, however, sometimes argued that the particular feature chosen in the regularity argument is one which experience gives us special reason to believe is closely related to the activity of an agent cause. The appeal is not to a bad inductive argument: the number of cases in which we know order to derive from an agent cause versus the much greater number of cases in which we observe order and have to infer an agent cause. The appeal is to one highly significant feature of similarity where we know on one side of the analogy that the feature always arises from an agent cause. Hume is aware of this move and I make his answer into a separate criticism of the design argument. 2B. 'Order, arrangement, or the adjustment offinal causes is not, of itself, any proof of design; but only so far as it has been experienced to proceed from that principle' (Dialogues, I46). That the design argument is an empirical argument and that it cannot be forced into a form of the cosmological argument by asserting a priori that 'order can only arise from an agent cause' may seem obvious. But in this remark Hume is also denying that order is always and intrinsically related to an agent cause.' There is nothing which specially relates order to an agent. Is this true? Yes, for the reasons (a) to (c) which follow: these are suggested by what Hume says but I develop them in each case. (a) We can observe that the cause of order is the activity of an agent only in a minute percentage of the examples of order which are known to us: Here we may remark, that the operation of one very small part of nature, to wit man, upon another very small part, to wit that inanimate matter lying within his reach, is the rule by which Cleanthes judges of the origin of the whole (Dialogues, 176). But as it stands this ridicule of Cleanthes' case is not decisive. It is sometimes possible to argue from a small sample. What is found to be a property of one sample of hydrogen in a laboratory, in the absence of any evidence to the con trary, will be presumed to be a property of all samples of hydrogen whereever 1 Hume speaks of order and final causes (purposes). Thus in this instance his objection is directed at both the regularity and the teleological arguments. In my discussion I largely ignore the teleo logical argument. This is because (a) in the Dialogues the context of the remark is concerned with discussion of the origin of order and no further reference is made to purpose; and (b) Hume has no need to try to show that purpose in nature is not specially related to an agent cause (a difficult thing to do if purpose in nature is admitted) since he has an argument (see p. 333n) to explain the appearances of purpose as the consequence of non-purposive regularities. I2-2</page><page sequence="10">340 J. C. A. GASKIN found. On the other hand, if I know of one grove of trees that it has been deliberately planted this does not give me grounds for asserting that all groves of trees have been deliberately planted. When does a sample give grounds for an assertion about a whole population? The hydrogen in the laboratory was a sample taken at random of a stuff which we have no reason to think of as other than homogeneous. What is true of it (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) would be true of any sample. The grove of trees on the other hand was a particular grove known to be planted and we know that groves of trees are sometimes planted and sometimes grow up by themselves; therefore the known origin of a particular grove gives us no guidance about the origin of any other grove. But this is precisely the case with the origin of order. We know, in exactly the same sense of 'know' as with the grove of trees, that order is sometimes found and sometimes imposed by man, and the known agent origin of order in a few particular cases does not give grounds for a pronouncement concerning the origin of order in general. (b) In a space-age film which otherwise stretches the credulity (and the patience) of its audience to the maximum, everyone is instantly supposed to recognize (and does recognize) that a large regularly shaped metal oblong emitting powerful radio signals and found beneath the surface of the moon is an artifact, not part of the order of nature. If order is supposed to be in trinsically and always related to an agent cause, how is it that this distinction between artifacts and natural objects is so readily understood? What is it about agent-imposed order which distinguishes it from the given or naturally occurring order? First, agent-imposed order seems to be recognized in objects which in other respects (e.g. shape, size, function, material) are the same as, or closely similar to, objects we know from experience to be agent-ordered. Thus if I discover on a deserted island a box containing a system of inter connected cogs and wheels, or even a single wheel, or the word GOD outlined in stones on a beach, I instantly recognize this as just the sort of thing I have previously seen done by men. Secondly, agent-imposed order is recognized in objects which are non-repetitive, or repetitive only in contexts where the repetition is not amenable to explanation in terms of scientific laws which take no account of activity of agent causes. Thus systems of concentric ring marks on flat stones are attributed to an intelligent agent since they are only found in areas which have been ancient human settlements and they have no scientific explanation. But, in contrast, cup holes are found in rock formations throughout the world and in almost all geological strata and they have a scientific explanation: the action of water over long ages rocking a small stone or pebble. Thirdly, agent-imposed order is recognized when the object can be understood to serve an intelligible purpose which is not explainable by reference to the working of regularities of succession. Thus if satellite observa tion confirms that a certain area of the moon is normal but whenever, and only when, a human investigator approaches, deadly radiation is given off,</page><page sequence="11">HUME AND TEIE DESIGN ARGUMENT 34I then in the absence of other explanation the radiation might be attributed to some agent whose purpose was to keep investigators away. It is of course true that these criteria are difficult to apply on occasions. Is an oddly shaped stone manmade or water-eroded? But these occasional difficulties neither render the criteria generally unworkable nor show that we should not try to apply them. That we do use and are entitled to use criteria of this kind for distinguishing between the sort of order characteristic of artifacts and the different sort of order characteristic of natural objects sheds light on the confusion in the Shakespeare plays argument. The order in nature, it is sometimes said, could no more have occurred without an agent as cause than the intelligible order in the plays of Shakespeare could have occurred without an intelligent author. But this begs the difference between the kinds of order found in a play and in nature. The plays of Shakespeare are uniquely sophisticated examples drawn from a group of objects (intelligible writings) which in our experience always derive from agent intelligence and which display individuality and purpose. (This is what made the writing on Belshazzar's wall so significant - Daniel, ch. v.) On the other hand, the order, or multiplicity of orders, in the natural world is the repetitive, infinitely extended, non-purposeful order which is never found in artifacts and which is never mistaken for them. So different is the order in nature from the order associated with agent intelligence that on the exceedingly rare occasions when nature does display agent intelligence the occasion is dignified as a miracle.' (c) Finally, according to Hume, we have no reason to suppose that order is intrinsically and always given by an agent since we can observe in the universe other things than rational agents which bestow order (Swinburne, 2IO; Dialogues, I76-8I): A tree bestows order and organization on that tree which springs from it, without knowing the order: an animal, in the same manner, on its offspring... And instances of this kind are even more frequent in the world, than those of order, which arise from reason and contrivance (Dialogues, I 79). Because of this it is, according to Hume, as reasonable (i.e. as implausible) to account for the origin of natural order by reference to vegetation or generation as to account for it by reference to an intelligent agent. Swinburne comments here: This suggestion makes perfectly good sense if it is the regularities of co-presence which we are attempting to explain. But as analogous processes to explain regulari ties of succession, generation or vegetation will not do, because they only produce 1 Since writing the above paragraphs my attention has been drawn to the very interesting remarks concerning the distinction between natural and artificial objects in Jacques Monod's Chance and Necessity (London, 1972), pp. 15-31. In particular Monod notes difficulties in finding criteria which clearly distinguish between living objects and artifacts. His remarks do not, I think, invalidate what I say. But they do suggest that the subject deserves more lengthy discussion than I have given or can allow it in a paper of the present scope.</page><page sequence="12">342 J. C. A. GASKIN regularities of co-presence - and those through the operation of regularities of succession outside their control (p. 2I o). Now this implies that intelligent agents produce regularities of succession (Swinburne's example of which is Newton's law of gravitation) in a way in which vegetation and generation do not. I dispute this. It does not seem to me that the intelligent agents which we experience are ever responsible for making regularities of succession in things 'such as their behaviour in ac cordance with the laws of nature'. What intelligent agents do is to find out the workings of nature and then employ these workings for their own purposes in clocks, antibiotics, atomic power stations, etc. The difference between the order created by generation and the order created by intelligence is not that the former produces regularities of co-presence and the latter regularities of succession, but that the former occurs in accordance with the blind operation of regularities of succession, whereas the latter occurs in accordance with the conscious and deliberate employment and understanding of regularities of succession. Thus I would agree with Hume that the all-pervasive order in nature is no better explained by the analogy of intelligence than by the analogy of vegetation or generation. In summary: the general analogy between the works of nature and human artifacts is very weak. The similarities are few and where they exist the differences of magnitude on the two sides of the analogy further devalue the argument. When reference is made to the particular feature of order it is found: that experience does not show that order always or even frequently has an agent origin; that the order in artifacts is recognizably of a different sort from the order in nature; and that the attempt to account for the order in nature by reference to an intelligent agent is little or no better than the arbitrary attempt to account for the same order by reference to generation or vegetation. 3. If an intelligent agent is required to explain the order in nature then the intelligent agent will in turn need to be explained (Dialogues, i6o-4). But if we stop [at the agent explanation], and go no farther; why go so far? Why not stop at the material world? How can we satisfy ourselves without going on in infinitum? And after all, what satisfaction is there in that infinite progression? (Dialogues, i 6 i: Philo speaking). An answer is given by Cleanthes: Even in common life, if I assign a cause for any event; is it any objection, Philo, that I cannot assign the cause of that cause, and answer every new question, which may incessantly be started? (Dialogues, I63). Philo agrees, with qualification, that it is not an objection if a cause cannot itself be explained: Naturalists indeed very justly explain particular effects by more general causes: though these general causes themselves should remain in the end totally inexpli</page><page sequence="13">HUME AND THE DESIGN ARGUMENT 343 cable. But they never surely thought it satisfactory to explain a particular effect by a particular cause, which was no more to be accounted for than the effect itself? (Dialogues, I64). The qualification in the word 'particular' needs emphasis. An explanation is good and need not itself be explained provided the explanation is more general than, or known apart from, the thing which it purports to explain. Swinburne misses the significance of this qualification in his counter-example: The existence of molecules with their characteristic behaviour was 'no more to be accounted for' than observable phenomena, but the postulation of their existence gave a neat and simple explanation of a whole host of chemical and physical phenomena, and that was the justification for postulating their existence (Swin burne, 208). Precisely! The postulated existence of molecules explained more than a par ticular effect. More is known about molecules than that they explain, say, why water is produced by burning hydrogen. But it is Hume's contention that the postulation of an agent cause to explain why the order in nature is what it is (or is there at all) is a postulation which does not explain: such an ex planation is no more general than the order in nature itself: No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious hypothesis, no event foreseen or foretold, no reward or punishment expected or dreaded, beyond what is already known by practice and observation (Enquiry, I55). Nor is the operation of an agent intelligence intrinsically any better under stood or less in need of explanation than the order in nature: To say, that the different ideas, which compose the reason of the supreme Being, fall into order, of themselves, and by their own nature, is really to talk without any precise meaning. If it has a meaning, I would fain know, why it is not as good sense to say, that the parts of the material world fall into order, of themselves, and by their own nature? (Dialogues, I62). 'It were, therefore, wise in us, to limit all our inquiries to the present world, without looking farther' is Philo's typically Humean conclusion. But it is the contention of Swinburne (p. 204) and others that we have alternatives. Either we can take the regular workings of the universe as brute facts, ultimately unexplainable by reference to anything. Or we can explain the regular workings of the universe by reference to 'the rational choice of a free agent'. Of these alternatives Swinburne prefers the latter because 'we can explain some few regularities of succession as produced by rational agents and the other regularities cannot be explained except in this way'. Hume would seem to prefer the former because, according to him, no greater understanding of the universe is achieved by postulating an agent as its cause. The issue here is not whether the regular workings of the world must be ex plained by an agent cause (clearly they could be left as brute facts). The issue</page><page sequence="14">344 J. C. A. GASKIN is whether any worthwhile simplification is achieved in ultimately reducing agent explanation and scientific explanation to the same thing: agent ex planation. This is one of the matters explored at some length in the Swin burne-Olding controversy (see p. 33I, n. i) and there is not the space to follow that argument here. Suffice to say that if the design argument reduces to a debate about an application of Occam's Razor then it is going to have neither the influence nor the significance given it by writers from Aristotle to Einstein. III. CONCLUSIONS The criticisms I have discussed are amongst the more significant of those with which Hume attacks the design argument. There are others. For example, it could be argued that if the design argument were valid then it would as readily establish the existence of a committee of designing agents as a single architect. Again, it may be that a certain construction put upon the notion of chance, together with the supposition that particles of matter exist over an infinite period of time in a very large but finite universe, could explain why the regularities of nature are what they are. This would provide a positive alternative to the 'brute fact' or 'agent caused' dichotomy. Another possible criticism of the design argument focuses upon the difficulty of balancing the analogy between man and the designer: if the analogy is very remote, the designer may not have enough features to identify him with anything like the God of traditional theism; if it is very close, the designer may appear ludi crously anthropomorphic. These and other criticisms are in the Dialogues. In these cases Swinburne's counter-objections are, in my opinion, either valid or would take so long to discuss that they would require a book, not an extension of this article. Beyond Hume's work there are of course other criticisms of the design argument, notably Kant's: that order and purpose are not so much features of nature but concepts imposed upon the manifold of existence by rational beings in their attempt to understand it. These criticisms lie beyond the scope of this article. Swinburne points out that the design argument is not the only evidence for theistic belief: the design argument is part of a large web of observations, experiences, arguments and historical beliefs which add up (perhaps) to a coherent and reasonable belief in the vast intelligence which men call God. But if theistic belief depends not upon the appeal to any particular argument or observation, so the destruction of the design argument need not depend upon the decisiveness of any one objection. Thus Hume never poses a single knockdown disproof of it as he does with the ontological argument. The effect of his criticisms, particularly his erosion of the plausibility of the analogy upon which the argument depends, is cumulative. At the end he even allows the remote possibility that the principle of order in the universe may bear some faint analogy to human intelligence. But the possibility is so remote and</page><page sequence="15">HUME AND TIHE DESIGN ARGUMENT 345 the analogy so faint that no atheist would be disturbed by it and no theist would make it the foundation of his belief. In such a situation the hesitant agnosticism of Hume seems most appro priate: in the discussion of theology and natural religion 'We are got into a fairyland ... and our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses'.1 1 I am most grateful to Professor E.
