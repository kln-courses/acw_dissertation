<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL BY WINSTON CHURCHILL One sultry August morning in 1919 a writer, whom we shall call Gideon, was seated at an open window of a cottage by the sea when he became aware of certain throbbing sounds. Was it a pump in the neighborhood, which he had never heard before? Or was it the sound of drums ? They must surely be drums. Even as he listened they multiplied until he thought he heard thousands of them throbbing in the heat. Some were louder than others; but the loudest, he conceived, were some two millenniums away,? if we may be permitted to express time in terms of sound, as we shall. They were of about the era, he thought, of the greatest might of the Roman Empire. Others were a little fainter, and others fainter still, and thus he was carried back and back into the remote ages of man. Yet each series?or group?was dis tinct from every other series. All beat together in a mighty, a somewhat terrifying rhythm, which at intervals was syncopated, and at other moments unsyncopated, like the beat of the pump, which he had forgotten. All of ancient history was unrolling itself in those drums. He was gazing into a vista of sound. History, the conflict of passions creative and primitive, was ex perienced and felt in those rhythms rather than seen and thought. The tympanums of the legions as they tramped, the bucinas and the clarions, were scarlet sounds. Here, as his mind swept back, annihilating time, were dark peoples on the borders of that an cient, land-surrounded sea; dark peoples clad in white, swaying, revelling, feasting; archers and chariots going forth to war, pillage and lust; towers crashing, human cries; long lines of bowed captives treading the hot, eastern dust. Mad processions wound through the streets of strange white cities chanting to Tammuz or Sandan or Cybele. Mantis, kedeshim, sacred men of Ishtar sat in the sunbaked temple courts, chewing the sacred food in rhythm. Slaves were driven forth in the hot dawns to</page><page sequence="2">484 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW raise the temple stones in that rhythm; artists chipped, craftsmen beat in it. Then, in another rhythm, all crumbled away. Time rolled back. Gideon seemed to be in the hot darkness of clashing gongs where gods of fear and lust, of war and hate held out brazen arms to be fed, and then these vanished. Now there were only sun-dried villages of the plain where the great rivers, Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel and Euphrates flow down to a sunny sea. Half naked men and women were squatting under the palms, beating soldrums, made of skins stretched over fire-hollowed blocks. Souldrums! Presently Gideon picked up his pen, and instantly his hand began to move across the page, in rhythm: The strokes of the pen made the rhythm audible. It rose, only to fall again impotently. It was jazz time, syncopated, the rhythm of the blood. Again he was impelled to put his pen to the sheet, and now it ran over the paper like this:? This rhythm was unsyncopated, with the accent on the first beat, the rhythm of machinery, of the pump he might have heard, the rhythm of the locomotive, PUFF, puff, PUFF, puff; the rhythm of industry, of the factory and the mill, of the reaper as he swings his scythe; of great poetry and prose, of great music. It swept on and on. Once more Gideon put his pen to the paper, and now he became, as it were, a seismograph. The pen started out in the creative rhythm, but it seemed to be interfered with. It became broken, confused, staggering. Then it would get a start again, only to be slowed down by the syncopated. At the end of the experi ment, of which he was merely a passive agent, the two came to such a mighty grip that the world rocked as with an earthquake?</page><page sequence="3">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 485 What did it mean? It has taken some years to acquire a theory of life to fit this and other experiences which Gideon had. Owing to the limitations of this article, only a few suggestive aspects of our hypothesis can be presented. In the first place we posit what we shall call a primitive mind, as distinct from an "unconscious" or "subconscious". It controls a brain situated on either side of the spine, which is the sympathetic nervous system; and it normally supervises metabolism and digestion, which is carried on by a primitive energy moving a set of muscles in the syncopated rhythm. It controls, in the same rhythm, the beating of the heart; and breathing?which, however, is regu lated in another rhythm by another mind, the creative. When called upon, the primitive mind operates the glands, which are centres of administration for the direction and concentration of energy. Ordinarily man performs in the syncopated rhythm of this mind the acts which are expressions of primitive instincts, such as chewing when he is hungry, laughing?when it is the ex plosion of a primitive emotion?and certain dances, as when he breaks into capers and drags one foot after the other. Savage dancing is in this rhythm; also involuntary acts, as when a sudden noise causes a leap. All this, except humor and dancing, applies to animals. A cub takes the breast in that rhythm. Man, how ever, has habits in it, biting the nails or scratching the head, or twitching?primitive emotions seeking expression. The syncopated primitive energy of this mind is capable of using the voluntary muscles, not only in involuntary acts, but in habits which are acquired from the conscious or creative mind, such as walking, using the hands and body for constructive purposes, writing, tending machines, playing games, and so forth. These, when learned by the primitive mind, are carried on automatically; but in an unsyncopated rhythm, because they are under the direction of the creative mind, whose dominant will-energy is reinforcing the primitive. The primitive mind is ancestral. All our inheritances are in it, from the beginning of animal life, without doubt. The body must be regarded as the phenomenal and physical projection of the primitive mind, the nature of which, in any individual, must have been fixed at conception. It is a unique combination of</page><page sequence="4">486 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW tendencies or forces of countless ancestors, and the result of a compromise of these forces. They are manifested in the features, in the peculiar structure of any body, of any organism; and also in the adaptability of that organism for certain accomplishments or habits acquired by the primitive mind in prehistoric ages, such as the use of weapons, instruments or tools in arts or crafts. Some individuals, for instance, are more combative than others, some play games, or draw or carve, with more facility than others. This structure of the organism and these tendencies could not be dynamically manifested unless the primitive mind were continu ously supplied with this ancestral energy?or what we phenom enally recognize as energy?which the primitive mind distributes to the body. Nevertheless the creative mind?which we are coming to?is able when it gains control of the body to effect modifications in the organism, and hence undoubtedly in the in heritance. The creative mind is therefore the factor in evolution. The primitive mind is concerned with preserving and reproduc ing the body. Its concerns or desires for this end are called prim itive instincts. It is excited and the ancestral energy is aroused by emotions of cupidity, precaution or fear, which strive to be expressed in acts. The acts which express these emotions are often termed instincts, such as eating or combat, or gathering in herds by animals and by men in society; acquiring, holding and possessing money or goods, or those we primitively love. One of the discoveries in which Swedenborg anticipated confirmation by science is that the rhythm of the breathing and the brain is the same, and differs from that of the blood beat. It is unsyncopated. In our hypothesis what is ordinarily called the brain is the instrument of a creative mind whose will-energy is in this rhythm. If we might term the basic function of the primitive mind the digestion of food, then the basic function of the creative mind is the digestion of experience. It makes asso ciations between phenomenal aspects of the universe, people, things, events, recording them in the "memory". The creative mind has instincts, too; and they are similarly, as might be ex pected, of self-preservation and sex. There can be no doubt that sex, in addition to being a passion of the primitive mind, is the mainspring of creative forces. And it was with a profound</page><page sequence="5">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 487 conviction that the ancient religions conceived of divinity as male and female, both in the physical and creative realms. Whether or not this principle was left out of the original teachings of Jesus, which otherwise confirm the true nature of mind, is an interesting speculation. There are indications in the Gospels that it was not disregarded. The self-preservative instinct of the creative mind is exerted to protect the body from mental conflicts, to foster and cherish a certain group of associations to which we shall in a moment refer, and which are the individual so far as it is concerned. Now, just as the primitive instincts are "true", can be gratified, in their value, so also the creative in stincts are "true"; that is, capable of realization,?as may be proved when we learn to trust them utterly. Fundamentally hope and faith, as these emotions may be called, the "will-to believe", contemplate union or emotional identity with those we "love" or depire. The instincts in the relationships are for the construction or coordination of elements hitherto diverse, in harmony, proportion, symmetry?in beauty, for which a better word would be significance. Sometimes, perhaps, the urge seems simply for these, and we do not understand that they always imply a communion of minds. The interesting thing about the creative mind is that it can possess the senses, relegating to the primitive mind its functions of digestion, and so forth, and acquired habits; conferring a more desirable value on eating and drinking and the sex relationship, which in this case is not promiscuous. Paul knew a great deal more about psychology than has been suspected when he wrote that the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace. We do not mean to say that the primitive emo tions may not confer satisfaction and happiness in their own value. There are thus two values of response to sense stimuli; to put the thing broadly, it depends upon which mind we are living in. The . trouble comes when the creative instincts are aroused and we get a conflict with the primitive emotions, of the two rhythms, the two energies which, when it grows acute, Paul characterizes as "death"; and which in the figurative language of the Gospels is referred to as the "everlasting fire"; a very real figure, for in the intense "religious" or creative experience it has an absolute</page><page sequence="6">488 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW resemblance to fire. We venture to say that it is the fire and not the conflict which lasts forever, though the conflict may be pro longed and terrible until a knowledge is gained of the ability of the power of the creative energy to put an end to it, and of the manner of using that power. Instincts are not aroused, as is commonly thought, by sugges tion through the senses, by what we hear or see or read in this phenomenal world. What we have to call the emotional realm is basic, the phenomenal secondary. In the acute creative experi ence emotions are thoroughly realized as manifested by forces, in what is known as "automatism"; they contemplate the kind of phenomenal action expressed in ideas. Ideas are translations by the digestive apparatus of the creative mind of emotions into phenomenal concepts, symbols, words and diagrams, pictures and sounds. All our "knowledge", all our emotional experience, is in these concepts, in order that we may understand the emo tions for action in the phenomenal world. They are our memory associations. When we make an association between two hitherto diverse? to us?elements of the universe this new knowledge always comes by creative emotions, which we recognize by their value, if we have wholeness. But the significance of these creative associa tions is human unity of a special kind, which we shall attempt to explain by illustration. Suppose a man, in the cave-dwelling days, is expressing in rhythm a primitive emotion by rubbing two sticks together. This is akin to savage dancing. Suddenly the sticks take fire. He jumps away, in an involuntary act of fear of a new phenomenon. Perhaps the fire burns him. We shall deal with involuntary acts later on. After a while wonder over comes his fear, and he has the creative emotion which makes the association between friction and fire. This gives him joy; ad venturously he rubs the sticks again, this time in a more desirable emotion than the first; and now he has a "hunch"?another creative emotion,?that if these two sticks will burn other sticks will. He has another flush of joy. Our contention, which we here considerably anticipate, will be that when a creative emo tion is pure, that is, unopposed by a primitive emotion, and there is no conflict in the mind, it expresses a truth; which means that</page><page sequence="7">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 489 the facts in the phenomenal world correspond to the emotional "sense of truth" of our fire-bringer. The emotion is first ex pressed in thought, and again in delight in act when the other sticks do burn, as anticipated. He now has digested or exploded two emotions by making two associations. He makes a third. He connects the heat of the fire with the coldness of the cave. He gathers some sticks and hurries to the cave and kindles a fire before the amazed members of his tribe. We shall suppose speech to have developed sufficiently for him to make use of it, too. The three associations he has made, which we shall call D, E and F, are three advances in knowledge of the unity of the uni verse. As he describes and illustrates each member of the tribe, if he understands?which means if a primitive emotion of desire or fear does not oppose?expresses each emotion as he listens and looks on. That is, the emotions of these understanding members immediately precede what we call the explanation, as the fire bringers did, and are there at the time to be expressed. The sight of the flames, the sounds of the fire-bringers' words, the phenomenal stimuli do not arouse the emotions, but merely make the necessary picture and sound records in the mind. The emotion uses the senses to certify to it. This is also true with a primitive emotion; and except in involuntary acts, the emotion is felt before the making of the association. The essence of fire-bringing is riot humanitarian, laying stress on the material service to mankind, and hence not primitive. It is that a group of minds have expressed, together, a consecutive series of creative emotions which have increased their knowledge of universal unity from D to F inclusive. This experiencing of identical creative emotions is the thing called love. The minds are identical, since a man is at any moment what he thinks and feels. If, with "undivided attention", interest, wholeness, we read the book of a modern fire-bringer, historian, scientist, we shall find our mind anticipating each point, association he makes. He is using, for us, "just the right word", or expression. When we are "learning" from a book we are expressing the symbols on the page, acting them in thought. We are not expressing them</page><page sequence="8">490 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW simultaneously with the author, but we are a "member" of him, of the "body" of our fellow beings who have made these unity associations; capable of creative emotional communion with them?of love. Science, knowledge, may be likened to a vine sprung from a sprout which, when it forked, made the first association in the mind of man in the series attesting to universal unity. One association has grown out of another; there is con tinuity and unity not only of facts but of minds. These are the branches. Sentimentality, which is characteristic of our civilization, is a conflict between the two rhythms, the energies of the two minds, and is the "divided self". Our civilization is based on morality, ethics, the knowledge of "good and evil", a dogma. If we are adherents of these and believe that they are founded upon some "divine" or universal law, and if we are unable to state that law in terms of science,?as have been defined,?then our house of knowledge is built upon the sands of dogma. Dogmas are the danger spots in the conflict of the "divided self". We have seen that the essence of love, social unity, consists in the being in the same emotions with others, in the making of those associations which are, indeed, creating a universe, since with each one it grows more complete. The making of such associa tions is a bond with a fellow being which, at the time of making, we feel to be eternally true. Such is the creative instinct-truth of social unity from which morality and ethics spring. We have all known at moments the joy of this love. The dogma which has been made as an association, or record in our minds, is pronounced by the churches to be true, yet the churches do not connect it up with the continuous series of unity associations which is the vine of knowledge as well as the human vine of the "kingdom of heaven". Our dogma does not say that science is "spiritual"; but that something else is "spiritual"?"doing good" to others, "thinking about others", being concerned about society. Our dogma does not seek first the Kingdom of God in creativeness, and say that these things s(hall be added unto us. But if we seek them first, bestow all our goods to feed the poor and give our body to be burned, we are doing so for primitive reasons and material ends. We "fool ourselves".</page><page sequence="9">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 491 And this is why. We have, though we may not be aware of it, two emotions each seeking to become us, one primitive and the other creative. An emotion becomes us when it is strong enough to seize in our mind the association which it wants and prevent another emotion from getting the association it wants. Now because of a lack of adequate associations of scientific knowledge which would enable us, or our creative emotion, properly to make use of its strength and obtain a victory, the primitive emotion has a great advantage. What does the primitive emotion, the primi tive will, in seeking to become us, to use us, desire? It desires consideration, position, esteem, friends who will help us, no dis agreeable differences of opinion or financial worries. Morality and orthodox religion, it thinks, can get it all these. "We" should be shocked, perhaps, if we thought that we were moral or religious for such reasons. " We " in this case is the creative emo tion which is dominantly us at the moment when the act or thought is in question. But there, in our associations, is the out lying dogma-island of ignorance, the danger spot. The primitive emotion seizes this and becomes the dominant emotion, becomes us; and we think, in practising morality, humanitarianism, in do ing good to others who are not in emotional unity with us, and which therefore demands a dutiful effort, that we are "spiritual". It should be observed here that we must rid ourselves of the notion that these emotions are "inside" of us, in a kind of rubbish garret called the "subconscious". The whole back of the uni verse is our "subconscious". We are instruments which are possessed and played upon by emotion,?will,?and usually very badly played upon. There is a very high type of primitive intelligence, moral and humanitarian. It is summed up, perhaps as well as could be, in a quotation from Green's History of the English People, in a song of one of the old hero kings. "Time's change and chances I have abided, held my own fairly, sought not to snare men; oath never sware I falsely against right." Because of an ignorance of Gospel psychology, it has persisted as an ideal until to-day. It is not sentimental, since no creative instincts, emotions, are involved. In the case we are now instancing, where a dogma does not come into play, such struggles as occur are between primitive emotions.</page><page sequence="10">492 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW With one consistent series, desire for honor and standing and fair material dealing, others of sex, inebriety and dishonesty, are overcome frankly because these latter do not pay in society. This is intelligent. There is here no " divided self ", because both in thought, argument and action it is the nature of the primitive emotions to contend, and the primitive zest is in overcoming or conquest, whether in ousting an opponent from a charity board or getting a stimulus from self-sacrifice, renunciation. It is this primitive will which for generations has been fostered in educa tion, and which is so fatal to creativeness in the child. Hence, when the sentimental conflict overtakes us and we seek to become ourself, we are fain to become as a child again. Education as well as religion has its dogmas, and they are equally dangerous. When we have wholeness in a creative emotion which is ex pressing associations, no primitive instincts are aroused. The primitive mind, and essential part of our personality, is attending only to its routine functions of digestion, and so forth, and per forming the habit, such as writing, for instance, which is used in the expression. It must be under the complete control of the creative emotion which is us, our will. The creative mind under these circumstances calls for a letter or a word, and the primitive mind, which has learned these concepts, responds. They are its patterns. No emotion is able to "think", express itself in thought or action, unless it controls or dominates the primitive mind. It is the nature of the primitive mind to be controlled by emotions; for all emotions, whether creative or primitive, are of the nature of will and exert the creative energy. To express creatively there must be no minority emotion. While we are in this state, then, a primitive emotion attacks the primitive mind, exerts itself to compel that mind to express in concepts in the associations, and hence in thought and action, some cupidity or anxiety, fear. If the invading emotion is strong enough?which means that we have not learned to handle this situation?the association is made, we are conscious of the idea, the emotion has gained entrance into our creative mind and from this vantage point is able to direct the primitive mind to energize the glands for action in anger, fear or lust. When it becomes conscious there is a conflict. In the intervals when we entertain the prim</page><page sequence="11">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 493 itive, when it overcomes the creative and is our will, it acts with the syncopated energy of the primitive instincts it has aroused in the nerves, directing us to what it wants. In the intervals when our creative hopes regain the ascendancy, they must act against the aroused syncopated energy. Here we have the sentimental conflict graphically shown at the beginning of this paper. We cannot here enter into the motives of emotions controlling the will of any individual for acquiring "automatic" writing; but it is common, when acquired, and even before it has been acquired, for a powerful emotion which cannot get expression in any other way to seize the hand or utter itself by the lips in "automatic" speech. One day our friend Gideon was moved by the creative emotion which possessed him to take up a book and read, and with his right hand to put his pen to paper. He was conscious of what he read, but not of what he had written "automatically" until he put down his book and read the writing. This is an experiment well known to psychologists. In this instance the creative emotion dominant allowed a minority emotion to ex press itself, in order that Gideon might understand the presence in him of two emotions. It is to be remarked that if he had not read the sentence he had written it would never have entered his consciousness, made an association, been part of his "memory". "Automatic" writing is never wholeness, although we may have in wholeness a dynamic impelling of the hand, when the creative emotions are intense. "Automatic" phenomena, when the im pulses are primitive, seem to be in the same category with nerv ousness, twitching and involuntary acts, where the minority emotion can get expression in no other way. If we are startled by a strange noise and jump, we must suppose that the noise? although others may be startled by it?is the phenomenal expres sion of an emotional event which has some connection with us. It is the urge to become creative that is causing our neuroses to-day, a struggle in which defeat is inevitable because of a lack of full knowledge of the mental processes involved. The so called "moral", which is really the creative struggle, can best be illustrated, perhaps, by what happens in the artist or scientist when he seeks the creative mood. He cannot, by "taking thought", by being anxious, get the new knowledge he desires,</page><page sequence="12">494 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW add a cubit to his creative stature. And in the intense creative experience, like that of our friend Gideon, in which the opposing emotions evidence themselves by powerful "automatism", he has found, if he attempts to write against them, that they have a more or less forceful grip on his body, and that they are using the motor nerves of the arm to prevent creative expression. He has to push against them. And the result, as he has learned to his cost, is exhaustion. He is thrown into prison. If he is using the typewriter, these emotions strike the wrong letters. The creative emotions can only partially succeed in getting their associations, and then in an adulterated and mutilated form. Words and phrases, even familiar ones to him, are blotted out of Gideon's mind. Here, we are convinced, is the clue to loss of memory. A supreme creative emotion can recall any life experience it desires at the time. Here also is the clue to those disorders of the mind and body caused by forgotten events. If, in such a conflict as we have just described, Gideon chooses, he can permit his hand to write out "automatically" the desire or fear which any opposing emotion wishes to express. Paul must have understood and experienced this'' automatism''. Such were the "motions" or emotions of "sin", dynamically manifested in his "members" when he was "in the flesh"?the primitive mind. In the normal experience these primitive emotions are manifested as disinclination, laziness. If they gain associations, we must agree with these adversaries quickly by expressing and dismissing them. It is as fatal to entertain them, argue with them, as with flesh and blood adversaries.1 There is, in fact, no difference; the wills which belong to these are our obstructors. The thing to do when this "foot", our primitive mind, offends us is to cut it off. We can by degrees gain strength in the creative energy to shut off the primitive emotions from associations. From the practical standpoint we note this fact, that the more we dwell on a desire,?instinct,?the more it possesses us. This is as true of the creative instincts of hope and faith as it is of the primitive. The gaining of creative energy for shutting off the primitive mind and exorcising the primitive emotions is known as prayer; and the process is familiar to every successful artist, though he may *See Petrarch's dialogue with Augustine, and examples in Vol. I of Taylor's Mediceval Mind.</page><page sequence="13">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 495 not call it by that name. Here, psychologically, is the Christian principle of non-resistance, what in religious terms is known as "submission of the will". But let us have it clear what we are submitting to. All we have is the choice between two emotions. If we take the moralist method, as Adam did; if we "try to think'* "by the sweat of our brow", and not be "lazy"; if we are anxious for the morrow, or what we shall eat, or for the ideas or wool or linen wherewith we shall be clothed, we are merely exerting the primitive against the creative; letting these emotions write our book or conduct our life. This seems like will, because men have got it into their heads that will is exertion against opposition; and this is primitive will. We do not exert the dominant creative emotion which we assert. We let it exert itself. It then relaxes the body, and this does the cutting off. We shall find a continual tendency by the cut-off primitive emotions to tauten the muscles in involuntary impulses, attempting to gain associations. In this situation we cannot "think", except in the intervals when the creative emotions gain complete control and we assert and strengthen them. During the other intervals the primitive emotions have a grip on the centres used by the primitive mind for writing and speech. If we try to think or write, we are opposed. If we do not, if we persist in this practice of gaining creative will, we are filled with energy, and in energy alone is happiness and peace. The impulses given to the primitive mind by the invading emo tions, arousing the primitive energy, are utilized by that mind in its normal functions, and we are actually using the energy of our enemies to build up the body, and for digestion, and incidentally "blessing" them. There is no opposition of the rhythms, hence no drop in our energy. When we feel tired, it is because of a clash of energies. It is thus we lose energy. Salvation from sentimentalism demands courage and faith; but the suffering is sweetened. As time goes on we shall get longer and longer inter vals of true expression. As we practice this, in the intervals when primitive centres are cut off and we have no thoughts, these are rather wonderfully replaced by the creative rhythm. Little by little, as we feel this rhythmic energy pulsing through us, the spasmodic efforts of the</page><page sequence="14">496 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW primitive emotions cease, the discord, or the tempest, is stilled. The breathing, which is regulated by the creative mind, grows rhythmic; in deep breaths the surplus energy of the primitive emotions is relieved. From this phenomenon, no doubt, the state is called "inspiration". Sometimes the eyes are shut, in order the better to prevent sense expression; the word "mystic" seems to be derived from the Greek for "shutting the eyes". But we need no longer call the practice a mystic one. As the rhythm gathers strength and sweep, the aroused energy of the primitive subsides, the attacking emotions have no longer any effect upon the primitive mind. The reason for this is interesting. When the "inspiration" comes, the creative emotions express themselves in phrases, patterns of the rhythm, cadences, vibra tions which are ours, our $tyle, our self. These patterns are func tions of the organism, dependent upon the capacity of the chest and other factors; and the body, as an instrument, is a creation of the primitive mind. The body must respond to the emotional pattern that fits it, to the phenomenal expression of this, which is apparently shared by the emotions of the creative mind. In this pattern, as we write or speak in wholeness, we hear the words breaking on our consciousness like waves on the shores of a sea, a sea of all moods. It is the strength of harmony, of exaltation, of unity with other minds which music lovers feel at a concert when the orchestra and the audience are one. Each creative mind, apparently, takes the rhythm in its own pattern. It is therefore the strength of many wills expressing sequential emo tions. In music. Yes, its effect is music, and when thoughts are shut off it can be expressed as music. With this rhythm the soldiers of Cromwell and Huss shattered their enemies. Here is the origin of hymns, and all creative religious music; of heroic, elegiac and lyric verse. Festal hymns in Greece were chanted by the people in unison, and epic verse recited to the lyre. It is inevitably associated with social expression. Mr. Frazer, in an interesting comment,2 observes that the musician has done his part as well as the prophet and thinker in the making of religion. He quotes Pindar who, speaking of the lyre, says that all things hateful to Zeus in earth and sea tremble at the sound of music. 2 The Golden Bough, Adonis, Attis, Osiris.</page><page sequence="15">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 497 Prophets and priests prophesied to the music of harps, psalteries and cymbals. David drove away the evil moods of Saul. The psalmists, in the language of ancient war, drove out with this rhythm their enemies within. Francis Galton in his Memories notes that the human senses when rhythmically stimulated are capable of eliciting overwhelm ing emotions not yet sufficiently investigated. There seems to be such a thing as a rhythmic satisfaction of an instinct not other wise able to be expressed. Early in this paper we gave an example of a cave man rubbing two sticks in a primitive rhythmic ex pression. Here must be the origin of savage dancing to instru ments like the tom-tom, in the syncopated. Some creative music incites to marching, and some to creative thought. We should expect what is called jazz music, when unsentimental, to express not only sense gratification, including sex, in the primitive value, but all of what might be called the secondary instincts acquired by the primitive mind in the prehistoric ages, which lend themselves readily to the competitive and acquisitive aspect of our civilization; combat, but with weapons, superstitious fear, primitive mirth, the herding tendency and cruelty. In brief, all that is included in the term "mammon", which is a Syriac word for riches, but symbolic of the value. In ancient historic times we should have the wild flutes and cymbals of the orgies of Astarte, Cybele and Dionysus. In the other value, the pure creative, we should have such symphonies, for instance, as those of Beethoven, Bach and Brahms, certain hymns and folk songs. Any music lying between the two values would involve a conflict of the rhythms, and the ear of an artist could detect it as senti mental. Hence the unsentimental jazz would come under the head of art, but not of the value of the creative. We find the great masters writing syncopation, for contrast. Music expresses and resolves, as no other art, what otherwise seems to be a universal conflict. What has been written about the remorselessness, the cruelty in the animal kingdom would seem to be sentimental, an anthropomorphic application of man's dualism to that world. Animals, birds and insects have the two minds. The spider spins his web, perfect in art, struc ture and tension, in the creative rhythm. Birds build their nests, vol. ccxv.?no. 797 32</page><page sequence="16">498 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW bee and beaver work in it. The creative energy cannot be any different in man from that in an elephant, in a dog. The differ ence lies in the intelligence of man's creative emotions, which are responsible for his evolution in developing hands for using tools and a mouth adapted to speech. Thus he is enabled to enlarge his universe by continually making associations of unity. The universe of bees and beavers, as we might say, is of the same size for all. Man's dualism is due to the different levels of unity of individuals; while every new discovery or invention tends to change the organization of society and incites opposition? primitive minority emotions in the truth-bringer?from those whose material welfare is threatened. Animals must live in rhythm. When we shut out thought and get rhythm, harmony, we must have the condition of the animal which cannot think in symbols, which has no opinions, beliefs, and hence in all probability no mental conflict. In the wild state, his "thinking" must be the result of what is called "suggestion", and which is the ex pression of an emotion in phenomenal experience. His emotions are satisfied in action, and any energized state, whether of fighting or running away, need not arouse our pity. Fear is not a mental conflict with the animal. Pain is not keenly felt in an energized state, and when he relaxes the creative rhythm takes care of him. Some personal experiments in cutting off invading emotions during pain have led us to believe that its persistence is due to these. Without going into the problem of free will here, it can be said that man has what practically amounts to a choice of living in either one of the two values of emotions, two minds, either of which Can use all the senses in its own value. But our eye must be single, otherwise we shall get blurred expressions, and in conflict we shall be full of darkness. Herein, we think, lies the confusion which has dwelt in the minds of men concerning the psychology of the Gospels. The creative mind can stimulate the glands and give sensual as well as sensuous satisfaction. Its power and adaptability seem limitless. Saints and ascetics "starved the senses". Undoubtedly they made use of powerful primitive emotions in this act of will. It is not the nature of the creative emotions to oppose, and any attempt to use them thus</page><page sequence="17">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 499 brings on the conflict which is darkness. We think that there can be such things as ecstatic, yet possessive and primitive visions. At any rate, no visions have ever been of value to mankind except in the few cases where they have been expressed afterward in art, speech or writing or pictures. The Son of Man comes eating and drinking, enjoying to the full sensual pleasures in wholeness, which seems basically to be reality. Here is seemingly the idea of the Last Supper, of the early Christian custom of eating together, in communion. The taste of food, in the creative rhythm, has an exquisite value not realized in the primitive. A state of wholeness, and therefore a true expression of reality, we have defined as the complete control of the personality by the creative mind; and science as a consecutive series of phenomenal associations attesting to the unity of the universe. We have called the state of the individual of making new unity associations in wholeness, and also of expressing them with others, a state of love. But there also may be a state of wholeness, of truth, of emotional indentity with others, and hence of love, which can be termed not yet science. This is art, and we give the term the widest possible application. We may look at a landscape or a portrait and feel that it is true; or we may observe a phenomenon, and have the same pure emotion. But we cannot prove to others the truths of pictorial or literary art; and no critic, no matter how high his standing, can make us believe that a picture is good, or true for us if we do not feel the emotion. There are, however, what may be called standards of art; such pictures as Leonardo's9 which have been attested to in wholeness, as we infer, by great numbers of individuals. The standard, however, can never be that of science, until art is science. The great products of art bring us into a state of emotional identity with others, but the difficulty is that we do not possess the knowledge to remain in that state because these phenomena, ?with one exception we shall mention?have not been con nected up with the main body of science. The intermediate unity associations have not been made. There is, nevertheless, one branch of art which is provable by the canons of science, known to the Greeks. Mr. Hambridge, in his book on Dynamic Symmetry, proves by mathematical tests that certain Greek vases</page><page sequence="18">500 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW are true to natural law. An artist in a pure creative emotion would have of these vases the same conviction of truth, but he could not have proved it before Mr. Hambridge wrote his book. A musician in a pure emotion can detect sentimentalism in music. Belief, which is wholeness in creative emotions, in persons is in the same category as belief in art. Art is the manifestation or expression of human emotions. In the'moments when we love a person we believe in them. They are true for us. Their features, their gestures and smile express our pure emotions. But we are not yet able, at any rate, to prove that the vibrations of their vocal chords are not sentimental. All we can do in psy chology is to advance a theory which works in the conduct of life, and which may sometime be capable of phenomenal proof. In this paper we have posited that the source of our emotions, and of the energies which they manifest, is in an emotional realm, although these emotions can and do express the wills of individu als in society with whom we deal in this phenomenal world. We cannot prove scientifically the existence of persons in a life after death, but we can have the same personal belief in them as we have in individuals in the phenomenal world, or as in a work of art. We can get what we are convinced are pure creative con victions of them, expressed either in sight or sound; or convictions we are unable to express. For the present the proof of commun ion for society remains in its fruits in knowledge or art. We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. Winston Churchill.</page></plain_text>
