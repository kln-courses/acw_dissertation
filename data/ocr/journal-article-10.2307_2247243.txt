PROFESSOR SIDGWICK ON "TYPES OF ETHICAL THEORY Prof. Sidgwick's Critical Notice of Types of Ethical Theory in the last No. of MIND expresses no more dissent from its doctrine than I was prepared to expect: and his criticisms I should have preferred to weigh in respectful silence, had they been invariably addressed to opinions for which I am willing to answer. On several points however I have evidently failed to make my meaning clear to him: and chiefly from the desire to remove the false issues thus raised, I offer a few notes on his Review. In commenting on the classification of Theories as Unpsychological- studying man as one of the dependent contents of the world, and Psycho- logical-studying him as a self-conscious subject in himself, Prof. Sidgwick raises the question why I begin with the former, which I reject; though another rejected set, arising from a division of the latter-the Heteropsycho- logical-is postponed to the end. The reason, he supposes, is historical; and proceeding on that assumption, he naturally is displeased with the un- historical sequence of Plato, Spinoza, Comte, and with the detached study of each, apart from the continuouis process of intervening development. The arrangement is not historical at all, but purely logical. In the suit between the UnpsychoIlogicaJ systenms and the Psychological, the question is, whether kosmical knowledge provides for self-knowledge: in that between Idiopsychological theory and Heteropsychological, it is, whether unmoral self-knowledge provides for moral. The former compares two wholes ; the latter two sections of the second whole: and as the genera miiust be defined, before the species are differentiated, the very conception of the problem itself settles the order of its discussiomi. In disclaiming the obligations of an historian of philosophy, I certainly forfeit his advantages: and I am very sensible of the dangers of mistake in comparing schemes of speculative thought, originating far apart in place and time. Still it has not proved impossible to produce useful monographs on particular philosophers, where the authors of them have been furnislhed with the critical apparatus required by a competent interpreter. And. why a short series of themn, selected as representatives of distinct schools, should " sacrifice the more positive part of the inlstruction " they have to give us and yield only negative and unprofitable criticism, I aim unable to perceive. If, in attempting such a series, 1 have "unconsciouslv mixed modern categories with those of an earlier period," the fault is in the writer and not in his plan : for nothing is ricber in positive ilnstruietion than the discriminating comparison of ancient with modern categories which the plan itself enforces, and in which it almiost consists. The special interpre- tations of Plato to wbich Prof. Sidgwick takes exception have arisen in the process, not of mixing but of severing the elements of Greek conception and of our own ; while his criticism of them, derived from the maxim that vice is ignorance and that no one is voluntarily bad, falls away of itself when the terms of those maxims are translated back from the English to the Socratic sense. As an example of my "erroneous rendering of Platonic Ethics," "due to neglect of its historical relations," is add.uced imy assertion of Plato's avowed "preference of voluntary pravity to involuntary". This assertion is said to be made " on the strength of a passage in Hippias Minor (373, ff.); where- as," Prof. Sidgwick adds, " it appears to me certain that the argument of this dialogue-which belolngs to the earliest, most Socratic, stage of Plato's development-is purely 'elenchic' and negative in its direct results: the</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. 629 positive doctrine indirectly suggested being that voluntary pravity is impossible". This passagre is however only one of two to which I have referred as authority for my statement (i. 71). The other runs thus: " With regard to Truth, shall we not pronounce it but a crippled soul, that hears and cannot bear voluntary falsehood and is angry beyond measure with itself and others for telling lies, yet lives on easy terms with invollntary falsehoocl and feels no annoyance at being caught in ignorance, but is content to wallow in it like a swinish brute ? " This is from the latest "stage of Plato's development "; being found in the Republic, 535 E. Whether the myths of Plato express anything or nothing of his thought and character is a question too large for these brief notes. I could have hoped that Prof. Sidgwick would not begrudge me the small remnant of Freewill which I have tried to save from the other side of the throne of Necessity. But no: Do you not see, he suggests, that Plato insists on " capacity and skill to choose the better life among the possible alternatives"?- The suggestion implies that the believer in Freewill must set capacity and stupidity on a par for choice of the better, and has no right to stipulate for insight. It is new to me to mneet with such a conception of this problem. I supposed it admitted on both sides that, for right choice, an acquaintance with the relative worth of the possibilities offered, was an in- dispensable condition; and that the divergency arose on the ulterior point, whether such insight, instead of being simply condition, is itself determiner; or whether the soul which has it performs the part of chooser. There is much to be said for Prof. Sidgwick's refusal to accept the nmyth in evidence of Plato's belief. But that, in itself, it is constructed on the hypothesis of free selection at the moment of choice, is so plain from the dicta that the soul itself shall determine its own destiny, that virtue is subject to no lord,, that the responsibility is with the chooser and not with God-that I can conceive of no form of words which should remove it further from doubt. Prof. Sidgwick condemns, as " a profound misapprehension," my infer- ence from the fact that Plato's three-fold division of virtue in the Phcedrus had become fourfold in the Republic, by the addition of &amp;Kicatoo-v, viz., that in the interval he had comne to recognise in Right something other than the perfection of Understanding, and could no longer leave the voi3s of the Phcedrus on the supreme seat of guidance. Without entering upon any general defence of this inference, I will only observe that it is by no means incompatible, as Prof. Sidgwick supposes, with the paranmount place assigned to "the philosophic Reason" in the Socratic schools. It only claims for that " Reason," in Plato's later conception, a fiunction, missing in the earlier, other than that of simple Intelligence, and approximating to that which we assign to Conscience. There would be no occasion to dispossess the word vo,v of its supremacy; provided it were invested (like the corresponding word in many modern languages) with the meaning not only of 'knowing the true,' but of ' ordering the right'. My treatment of Plato's Ethics as 'Unpsychological' is rebuked by more than one of my critics. Prof. Sidgwick sees that, if the philosopher had been true enough to his Metaphysics to give them their due, the epithet would have been correct. But since, in the Republic, his " ethical doctrine " is worked out " by the 'inferior road' of empirical psychology," I am said to have practically misplaced him. If by his " ethical doctrine " be meant his criticism of current notions, his dialectic sifting of proverbial maxims, his analysis of the Hellenic State and his remedial rules for escap- ing its ills, it is true that one result after another is reached bv appeal to experience and manifold readings of character and life. But all this, however large a space it covers, is but tentative and subsidiary; and its result is not an 'Ethical Theory,' but an 'Ethical Art,' whose improved rules are gained by convicting the actual ones of inconsistency and failure.</page><page sequence="3">630 NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. What I mean by a ' Psychological Theory of Ethics' is not constituted by processes of logical search and psychological illustration, but by taking self-conscious experience as the starting point and auithentic interpreter of moral relations. It cannot tlherefore be attribuited to any philosopher who brings his ready-made categories with him from the macrocosm, and tries them as a skeleton-key to pick the lock of the microcosm. Without discussing the vexed question of the construction of Plato's Republic, I may sately say that its avowed plan is to proceed from greater to less, from kosmical to human, from the State to the Individual Soul. In it Right or Justice 'is based,,' as Prof. Jowett remarks, ' on the Idea of the Good, which is the harmony of the worvld, and is reflected both in the institutions of states and in the motions of the heavenly bodies '. 'The mnost certain and necessary truth was to Plato the universal: and to this he was always seeking to refer all knowledge or opinion, just as in modern time we are always seeking to rest them oni the opposite pole of experience.' The term ' Unpsychological' is applied by me to Plato, not in virtue of the 'transcendency' of his metaphysics, but of his descending upon ethics from metaphysics at all: it equially covers therefore the ' Imma- nental' branch. Hence I do not see the appositeness of Prof. Sidgwick's remark that the 'Unpsychological' origin of a " part of Plato's ethics" " is in no way dependent on the ' transcenidency' of his metaphvsics: in fact it is more definitely and emphatically put forward by Aristotle whose metaphysical 'scheme' is distinguished as ' Immanental "' (p. 430). Writing in the Highlands without access to books, I cannot yet re- examine my statements respecting Descartes and Malebranche by the light of Prof. Sidgwick's criticisms. I thank him for calling my attention to whatever seems doubtful in them. Meanwhile, I may say that I was not unaware of Descartes' wide use of the word Cogitatio, to include, in the human being, "sensations" and "volitions" as well as intellections. Else, how could I have used the following language in describing his doctrine? 'The essence of mind is thinking, whether intellectual or volitional' (141): 'Perception through the senses and imagination, he accepts as modes of thinking' (134): With hini 'it was the presence of the Soul' (whose essence is thinking) that turned the nerve-movements into sensations: he habitually speaks of the passions of the Soul, and of the sense-experience as belonging to it' (137). The 'animal feeling' however (the phenomenon on which the remark turns), such as we share with other creatures, is cer- tainly not included, but placed in antithesis to thought : for, in defining what it is that he withholds from the lower animals, he says, ' it is of thought, and not of life anid feeling that I speak': 'I do not refuse them sensation, so far as it depends on the organs of the body'. 2 How this reference of sensation, now to the soul, and now to organs of a body where no soul is, accords with the opinion that " Descartes maintained from first to last a perfect distinctness in conception between psychical and material facts" (p. 431), I am unable to perceive. Prof. Sidgwick doubts whether Descartes ever pushed his doctrine of the independence of mind and body so far as to hold their mutual incom- muni(ability. Is not the dictum-' It is the nature of substances that they exclude each other'-" adequate evidence that he had personally arrived at " this position? Why, else, should he invoke, as he does, the Divine interposition to bring the natural aliens into concurrence ? 3 With regard 'Translation of the Republic, lntroduction, pp. 4, 49, First Edition. 2 cEuvres, x., 207-208, as quoted in Types of Ethical Theory, i. 138. 3 Die Einwirkung der Seele auf den Leib und des Leibes auf die Seele geschieht unter Beihiilfe und Mitwirkung Gottes."

In my account of Malebranche's doctrine of Ideas, I have represented him as holding that 'the difference betweeni inmages or representations and ideas is the difference between knower and known,' and that ' modifi- cations of the mind are confined to the senses and imagination, and do not enter the area of the reason'. This statement is pronounced by Prof. Sidgwick " a not unimportant error," on the evidence of a passage which includes, amiiong 'mnodifications de l'ame,' not merely 'ses propres sensations,' and 'ses imaginations,' but also 'ses propres intellections'. It will be founid, I believe, that Malebranche himself may be cited for both the ex- clusive and the inclusive enumeration ; in conformity with which ray next words give the alternative statemiienit, that 'the changes and differences of sensation, representation, of emotion, impulse, will, are phenomena of the subject, modes of mental susceptibility, lights and shades of the personal history'. 'Will' means, with Malebranche, affirmation or denial, and is involved in the assent or dissent which every intellectual j udgment expresses. The cognitive act therefore, or 'intellection,' of the individuial subject (propre) falls into the class of ' modifications of the soul,' while the ideas cognised are not phenomenal, but eternal objects of Reason, subsisting in God. Prof Sidgwick attributes to me a preference for Malebranche over Spinoza, which he indulgently pronounces " legitimate" in a person of religious convictions, but which does not release me from the duty of exposing the cost of " philosophical consistency" at which the theological superiority is gained. I am unconscious of the alleged preference, and perceive nothing in my quoted comparison of the two to warrant its assertion. And the irreconcilable variance between Malebranche's Christian conception of God and that which he vindicated as a Cartesian I supposed nmyself to have adequately shown in the 'Estimate of the System' (espe- cially in sections 2-4) ; where, I believe, the reader will findn mention of all the inconsistencies which I am censured for failing to notice. In particular, it is contended that, while Malebranche meant to retain ' the characteristics of a sincere Theistic faith,' he sacrificed its essential condi- tions, and was brought, with ' logical certainty,' though unconsciously and by a different path, to a doctrine in 'affinity with Spinoza's'. I share Prof. Sidgwick's regret, and feel for my reader's fatigue, at the preponderance, in my first volume, of metaphysical over ethical discussion. Judgment however should pass upon tlhis fact by other considerations than the counting of pages. The object contemplated in studying this first set of intellectual hierarchs was, to determine the effect-of descending upon the survey of human life with a vast and dominating apparatus of cosmical prconceptions, foreign to its quality, and related to it in quantitv as infinitude to nothing. From the nature of the case, the reader is already pretty familiar with the group of human facts and feelings which are waiting for their interpretation: they may be trusted to say for themselves whether they sit at ease in the categories of a theory beyond tlhem, or pine in banishment when borne over metaphysic seas to the provinces of a new world. They may be taken therefore as so far known and ask no space from the expositor. But the other term of the problem,-the doctrine of the Universe whiclh proposes to pick them up and claim them as its own, -is an intellectual organism of complicated strucLture, of subtle essence, and on the largest scale. To every onie but its author it is the product of another's genius, not readily passed from mind to mind, through the medium of language full of intersecting conceptions. It is no wonder if, in order to seize the character of such a,system, the student has to make</page><page sequence="5">632 NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. sure of his way through many successive stages of investigation, into the security of its postulates, the nexus of its many-membered thought, the completeness and equilibritum of its relations. But when at length he has grasped it, and holds in his hand the forniula of its scope, it will not take him long to test its applicability to the moral experiences which it is ambitious to em-brace. Hence the relative brevity of the ethical sections in my first volunme. The single exception which I have admitted,-in the case of Malebranclhe,-unfortunately displeases Prof. Sidgwick, not indeed on account of its length, but because it reports the contents of a treatise previously unnoticed, and so mixes up exposition and criticism together. The reason is, that this particular treatise is On Morals: and, from this coincidence of subject, report and comment ran easily side by side, with economy of space and sparincg of memory. Prof. Sidgwick wonders that I have thought it worth while to notice Comte,-a writer who, " excluding Metaphysics from his system," could present for consideration no such " theoretic base " of ethics as alone I cared to estimate. I shotuld have justly incurred this criticism if I had placed Comte's doctrine amnong the Mietaphysical theories. But, as he is the chosen representative of the Physical systems, I do not see how his " exclu- sion of Metaphysics " forfeits his claim to consideration. It does not follow from his having no " fundamental doctrine of being," that he " excludes every possible theoretic base," that may be worth examining, for " his Art of Morals ". 0 yes, it does, replies my critic, at least for you; since you acknowledge no theoretic base, except a fundamental doctrine of obligation, which is impossible to a contemner of Metaphysics. Comte however, no less than Plato and Spinoza, may have his theoretic base without its being mine. He also supposes himself armed with a* 'Universal principle' covering ' the ensemble of morality'. And not only am I logically bound, as in the preceding cases, to estimate its adequacy ; but, the more I see to admire in his rules of conduct, the more anxious shall I naturally be to discover whether they rest exclusively on his founidation, or find as firm a support on my own. Turning now to the constructive chapters of the work, and, in particular, to the theory of Moral Authority, I own myself fairly open to Prof. Sidg- wick's demand for more precise explanation of what he not unfitly calls my " Theopsychological " doctrine. By some unguarded use of language I have seemed to lay down as a universal proposition, applicable to all beings of whom character can be predicated, that moral consciousness carries in it, not only a preference among affections as better and worse, but a looking- up to the former as wielding authority and imposing obligation from a higher nature. Such a proposition would of course imply that the highest of all must be witlhout the moral consciousness; that on this side the human mind and the Divine are severed from each other ; and that from the conscience of man there is no passage to the presence of God. Under- standing me thus, mv critic may well challenge my right to speak of " the Supreme Will" as "essentially a moral will," and call upon me "to ex- plain in what sense the term ' moral' is predicated in this affirmation ". I do not mean to claim for the sense of Duty and Authority a place within the essence of the moral consciousness per se and universally ; but only among the modifications to which that essence is subject in dependent minds. It is in the analysis of human character that it comes to light as an inseparable feature: beyond the conditions of that range I do not affirm it. What then remains, as the central essence, subject to be thus modified on entering our humanity ? The consciousness of a graduated scale of excellence among the springs of action in a mind capable of choice. This is the common feature of which I think as establishing ' a Divine kindred and a Divine likeness' between ourselves and God, and constituting 'an</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. 633 inward rule of right which gives law to the action of His power'. In both, it is an order of preferential love; in Him, eternal and invariable ; in us, as finite partakers of His nature, emerging by partial stages, and at every one contested by earlier habit or keener feeling. It is in this experience of resistance, special to the finite andl growing life, that the stringent sense of Duty,--of a must n-ot grappliaig us from below but persuading fronm above, -is born within us, and with the pure harmonies of moral preference mingle the solemn tones of indefeasible Authority. This additional element is a simple adaptation of feeling to fact on the importation of the archetypal excellence into the ectypal being : in the former the moral order is inmmanent ; in the latter it is transcendent : and the human consciousness of obligation higher than self is but the intuitive expression of this transcendency. It does not constitute the moral quality, but reveals its source and home. And the revelation brings a powerful and( muclh- needed aid to the dawvning, apprehension of affections n-obler than our own. As I have failed to convey my thought uponl this point to such a reader as Prof. Sidgwick, there must be something faulty in my exposition ; aind I am more anxious to correct than to defend it. Yet, lest I should seem to be now deviating into new doctrine, I must add two remarks. First, the distinction just drawn betweeni the 'moral' in man and in God is drawn and expressly emphasised on the very page (ii. 85) to which mv critic resorts for my most overstrained "analogy between Divine and human morality ". There, as passimn, it is laid down that only in a nature where there is conflict between the scale of worth and the scale of strength in the springs of action will the experiences and emotions arise wbich the woid moral connotes for us. Hence, ' where perfect harmony exists between the order of strength and the gradations of excellence, we have the true concep- tion of an angelic mind ; it is the true " saint's rest" ; the ultimate recon- ciliation between our personality and God's, in whiclh t'e breach between the natural man and the spiritual man is taken away by our integration with the Divine will. This repose at the upper end once established, the peculiar moral emotions, of apprebation and disapprobation, can no longer be directed towards the character: they are in place onilv among the contingencies of conflict, and have no applicationi either to a nature where liberty has not yet begun, or to one where emnancipation is complete organic necessity is beneath them, free sanctity is above them : a creature, to be atpplatuded, must be more than a creature: a God, to be (in any strict sense) pratised, must be less than a God. These sentimiients are replaced, at such an elevation, by the several degrees of admiration, love, and worship, towards which the ethical feelings ever aspire and in which they ultimately merge.' Having thus shown that only where we see temptation possible through a strife between wish and worth, can we entertain the sentiments due to the choice of duty and obedience to higher authority, I proceed to inquire lhow it is that the Christian ascription of Righteousness to God, instead of being a mere aesthetic contemplation of harmony, is so largely the expression of ethical trust, such as might be felt towards a humlan character of proved justice. The answer is that to us, whose thoughts have to follow the order of our own experience, the idea of inward harniony presents itself as an acme or final perfection towards which spiritual life for ever tends. We cannot otherwise reach it than by a ceaseless climb of reverence, lessening, step by step, the distance from the supreme height. Hence, we are betrayed, by a kind of psychological necessity, into a habit of religious feeling, as if ' both the Divine perfection and the saintly rest were the contrast and outcome of a conflict of moral alternatives, and resembled the repose in which a probationary dramna issues'.' By tllis 1 Types of Ethical Theory, ii. 85.</page><page sequence="7">634 NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. ' approach to God along the pathway of humanity,' I have explained the frequent application to Him of terms which, as previously shown, cannot, in strict accuracy, be cauried beyond the limits of human life. This explanation of an anthropomorphic habit, Prof. Sidgwick has mistaken for an adoption of it, while the exposure of its error which immediately precedes has apparently escaped his attention. Secondly, my critic, having recognised a half-truth in the claim, for "moral reason," of an authority "not merely of qmy own reason," supplies for me the missing half by saying (p. 436) that "it is no less true and no less important to affirm, with the late Prof. Green, that it is my own, and 'that ' it is the very essence of moral duty to be imposed by a man upon himself "'. I owe to Prof. Green so much more than the present of a half- truth, that if I disown this particular gift, it leaves mygrateful memory of him quite uninmpaired. But it certainly surprises me to find quoted against me words of his which I have myself discussed and appropriated as expressing, in spite of their superficial aspect of contradiction, a doctrine identical with my own. The ' self' of which they speak as ' imposing' moral duty' is the communicated self-consciousness of the ' Absolute Self,'-the infinite to the finite ; whereas the self on which it is imposed is the finite humanity which needs the regulative lawi. 'A man therefore is a " law unto himself," not by autonomy of the individual, but by " self-communication of the infinite spirit to the soul " ; and the law itself, " the idea of an absolute should be," is authoritative with the conscience, because it is a deliverance of the eternal perfection to a mind that has to grow, and is imposed there- fore by the infinite spirit upon the finite.'" After accepting the maxim thus interpreted, I did not expect to find it silently produced, as saying precisely what I had failed to see. When the light of this relation, between the Infinite and the finite Self, is brought to bear upon the moral element in both, i.e., when we read the relation downwards instead of upwards, the current language respecting the Divine Holiness loses much of the anthropormiorphic character clinging to it through the opposite movement of thought. If the moral order in our self-consciousness is a miniature photograph of the Divine, liable to be blurred and distorted by finite conditions, it is impossible to exclude the idea that the end of this self-communication is fulfilled or fails according as the archetypal order abides or perishes. No one who conceives at all of 'self-communication of the infinite spirit to the soul' can regard it as indifferent to ' the infinite spirit' whether the communication is realised or spoiled. Hence, the faith which we have in an Infinite ally through all struggles for the Right, in a Divine sympathy befriending our conscience in its resistance to temptation, in a self-identification of God with all the true heroism and patient sanctities of life, is an inevitable product of philosophical ponception: instead of being the magnified shadow of our own figure on the clouds, it is a selection from the solar light itself re- fracted in the little lens of our humanity. From my treatment of the doctrine of Merit and Demerit Prof. Sidgwick elicits the following "paradoxical result ". I have said that the merit of a right volition is proportioned to the vehemence of the tempta- tion it resists: I have also said that from the consciousness of moral obli- gation a belief in retribufory judgment is inseparable. Put these two propositions together, and it follows that the attraction of the temptation and the repulsion of the retribution must balance one another and leave the agent without possible merit. So at least I understand the conclusion (p. 437) " that the more intensely and unreservedly a man holds a belief which the moralist declares to be inseparable from' moral judgment, the 1 Types of Ethical Theory, ii. 98-99.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. 635 more impossible it is, according to the same moralist, that any merit should attach to his moral choice ! " I confess, the reductio ad absurdum does not frighten lile: the paradox in form appears to me common sense in reality: and when I meet with a man who refrains from a guiilty in- dulgence merely because its seductive light is darkened by the black shadow of overhanging punishment, I must still award him no higher epithet that prudent. That this agrees with the natural human sentiment is attested by the frequent and just reproach against the religion of nmere hope and fear, -that it is only ' other-worldliness,' just as self-regarding as worl(dliness, only with a longer head. The hypothesis from which the paradox emerges artificiallv shuts out the conditions of merit, in order that it may be dis- proved in the conclusion. The inseparability from the moral consciousness of a belief in retributioil does not mean that the sinner miiust have it at the moment of his sin, but only that in the total experiences of the human con- science it will assuredly present itself. In point of fact, instead of entering in advance with the colflict of impulses under temptation, it steals in at last with tlle offender's remorse, and leaves a melanlcholy appeal to interest with the weakened mind that has proved deaf to right. The revelation is in itself a falling back upon Prudence of the baffled line of Duty. When it is after- wards present to the mind in probationary moments, it cannot be on the same terms as the contending incentives immediately competing for the will, buit as a surmise of the future, an augury of the unseen. If under these conditions we deem it a merit that it should prevail, it is because when wisdom, like right, is able to dispense with excitements and act upoIn a hint against clamorous inferiors, it miarks a character of higher grade ; still however only on the prudential side, except so far as it works in partnership with a preference of greater worth. Suppose the distanit and unseen interest to become invested, by force of imagination, with the in- tensity of present fact, so as to call for no faith and be at no disadvantage in comparisoni with the instant solicitations of lower passions, and its countervailing influence will earn no recognition of merit. In treating of the objects of moral judgment I am said by Prof. Sidgwick to have confounded together two distinct questions ; viz., (1) the relative order, in the historical evolution of human sentiment, of verdicts on out- ward action and verdicts on their inner spring;' and (2) the direction of judgment, in our mature moral consciousness, primarily upon motrve, or upon intention (both being inward). To me, for reasons which I will immediately restate, these questions are not (listinct, bIut inseparably one; the imagined "psychogonic" order front ouitward to inward, from "legal" to "moral," being simply impossible ; laws of conduct being the mere expressioni of such moral feeling as can be socially enforced ; mischievous acts being resented from aversion to wronig passions ; andl no likes and dislikes of good and evil from purely outward sources having any affinity with moral judgment. Moral evolution I do not call in question: buit from first to last the scene that ever widens before its eyes and comes up for judgment is on the inner side of our humanity, of which the external drania is but the speaking symbol. But then, granting that this has at all events now become tIrue, Prof. Sidgwick complains that I have not accurately discriminated, in the state of mind of a voluntary agent, what it is that we primarily judge; but speak loosely of several things, 'spring' and 'principle' of action,- even of ' motive,'-so as to include what he calls intention as distinct from I I learn with regret tlhat, in dealing with this first branch of the sub- ject, I criticised a passage which no longer appears in the 3rd edition of the Methods of Ethics. My MS. had quitted my hands before I knew of that edition; I believe, before its issue.</page><page sequence="9">636 NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. Motive, as well as what he calls motive as distinct from intention.' My first reply is, that the interchange and combination of these words do not indicate any vagueness in their use, but only that I have to predicate one thing of them all, viz., that what they denote is subject to ilmoral judg- ment, and that the differences among them (lo not take any of them out of that category. When tlherefore I ami only determining the limits of that category, I may speak of thnem generically, or namne any species by way of example. My next reply is, that I have carefully marked their distinc- tions: and, in the case of 'motive' and 'intention,' have (witlh a qualifi- cation here irrelevant) done so in precise agreement with Prof. Sidgwick's own statement, that the 'motive' covers what the agent desires, the 'intention' what lhe designs. This distinction is borrowed by both of us from Bentham, and fturnishes a just and useful psychological antithesis. In the ethical valuation of its two terms, the three writers deviate from each otlher. Bentham, on the ground that there is no human 'desire' without its legitimate place, pronounced all 'motives' good, and so threw all the shadles of right and wrong upon the 'intention,' or designled effects. Prof. Sidgwick, regarding this as " paradoxical," admits ' motives' (in the fornm of desired effects) into estimate as good or bad but contends that the primary object of approval or disapproval is the 'intention,' or designed effects of the act. So preponderant is its influence, that "in many im- portant cases the questioni of motive as distinct from intention is not even raised " (p. 439). Both these doctrines assume that moral juidgment addresses itself ex- clusively to contemplated effects of action. Their terms, accordingly, are all prospective; even the word 'm otive,' wlhich in itself means no more thani present initiation of change, is made to look forward to an end in view. Being unable to accept this assumiiption, or to exclude from relative moral judgment the instinctive impulses of which foresight cannot be predicated, I have preferred a set of ternms which do not prejudge this doubtfiul point, but fix attention exclusively on the immediate energy out of wllich a chosen action issues ;-e.g., ' spring of action,' impulse,' ' incentive,' ' pro- pension,' ' passion, ' affection'. The word ' motive' may be applied to any one of these, no less than to "effects desired". And even where, as in maature reflection, effects are desired, they are so in virtue of some parti- cular affection, in which, rather than in themselves, lies that whiclh we approve or disapprove: so that, for purposes of moral description, I still would not desert the vocabulary which looks inward for that which mlloves forward. A doctrinal formiula wholly made up of 'motive' and 'intention,' and limiting the fornmer to preconceived aims, seems to me faulty, both as ignoring an instinictive type of actioln for which provision is requilred, and as withdrawing attention from tlhe seat in which the moral quality is discerned. Oni confining ourselves to the class of facts covered by the narrower antithesis, we see at once tllat the opposed terms are not irautually exclu- sive. 'Intention' is the larger and inclndes the 'motive' : among the 'designed effects' is founld, of course, the ' desired effect,' though along with it niay be others, in themselves unwelconme, but admitted uinder the witchery of desire. Henlce, in judging action by 'intentions,' we neces- 1 To exemplify this vagueness Prof. Sidgwick says: "E.g., lie speaks of the 'mind estimating its own imiipulses and volitions,' as if the two were convertible ternis ". Surely, that would require ' impulses or volitions': the ' antd' gives two objects of estimation, not one. Cannot the mind esti- mate more things than one? Does not Prof. Sidgwick himself affirm "that the molal sense of mankind judg es motives as well as intentions" (p. 438) ?</page><page sequence="10">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. 637 sarily take accoulnt of the 'motive' as one of them; and when Prof. Sidgwick says that our judgment " refers primarily to intentions as distinct front, motives," lie can mean no more than to deny any isolation of the motive from its companions, as our selected guiide to a true verdict. Yet he niakes statements which seem to say outright that to our estimate of a man's acts it may be no matter what the motive is, provided he keeps within a given external category ; you may change the assumed motive through the whole gamut of initiatives without modifying our approval or disapproval. Thus he says: "We call a man veracious if he has a settled habit of endeavouring in his speech to produce in the minds of others impressions exactly corre- spondent to the facts, wlhatever hiis miiotive be for so doing: whether he is moved solely or mainly by a regard for duty or virtue generally, or by a love of trutlh in particular, br a sense of the degradation of falsehood, or a conviction that trutlh-speaking is in the long run the best policy in this world, or a belief that it will be rewarded hereafter, or a sympathetic aversion to the inconveniences whichi misleading statements cause to other people." 1 If this only means that, however prompted, the supposed agent does not become a liar, but remains witlhin the bounds of the truth-telling class, it shows how we frame and name certain categories of concduct by purely objective considerations. But it does not show that, in the award of approval or disapproval to the cases under each category, the reference to motive is dispensed with, or is secondary. Yet this is the point at issue. The motive may not matter to the name we give a man; while making all the difference to the feeling we have towards him. For purposes of ethical classification, the ilnclusion of the 'motive' within the ' intention' is La very awkward feature. We want an anti- thesis, and we do not get it. The best way to obtain it is to take the ' intention' to pieces by another fundctmentum divisionis, and to separate, among the 'designed effects,' those which plead for the act from those which plead against it,-the persuasives and the dissuasives. The former constitute the motive, which is niamed in the spring of action whose wanalt urges us on. The latter constitute the resistance offered by some other affection, which will be hurt by our surrender. Each of these has its felt place on the fixed scale of wortl ; its place also on the personal scale of pleasure; and addresses our will from botlh positions. Our moral judgment sees at a glance wlhich of the two springs is relativclvT higher: if that which carries the will, the act is approved ; if that ir, spite of which it is done, it is condemned. In thus reducing 'motive' and ' intention,' as previously used, to two competing springs of action, we escape the temiiptation to exclude or isolate or disparage either, and by letting the judgment turn upon the relationi between the two, make all the contents a function of the result. The ethical scale of motives which I have sketched I must leave with scarcely a word of defence. The first critical act perfornmed on it by Prof. Sidgwick is to disturb from its lowest place, as simply inadmissible, the pure malevolence wlhich, 'strengthened by the weighty support of Mr. Sidgwick,' I had pronounced unconditionally bad.2 The softening plea now suggested on its bilhalf is puLt into the mouth of " the jurist," viz., 'that the demand for "vindictive satisfaction" is indispensable to the effective administration of the criminal law'. I need only remark that 1 MIND, p. 439, note, quoted from Methods of Ethics, 3d Ed., book iii., ch. 2, p. 222. 2 Types of Ethical Theory, ii. 176-177, with the quotation from Methods of Ethics.</page><page sequence="11">638 NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. the passion here designated under the phrase "demand for vindictive satisfaction " is not that which I have called ' Vindictiveness' and place on the lowest line, but is identical with the ' Resentment' which stands in the middle of my list. The exceptions taken to the particular cases adduced in illustration of the scale, all run up into this: You think that ouir approval here goes to the motive; I think it goes to the consequences. Arbitrating evidence between these opinions is doubtless difficult to find, or at least to present in any palpable form ; because the approving verdict directed upon external consequences will usually concur with that upon comparison of motives. Nevertheless I am convinced that, if the former were suppressed from view, while the latter were clearly per- ceived as inward phenomena of character, such a valuation as I have assigned would assert its presence. Prof. Sidgwick is unable to reconcile my approximate adoption of Kant's Ethical Theory with my dissent from that of the English 'Dianoetic' school, which, in the person of Price and even of Clarke, camiie near to hini. Having defined my exact relation to both with such poor success,' I can hardly hope to justify nmy loyal feeling towards the philosopher of Konigsberg. The case stands thus. Our Dianoetics referred all moral ideas to the Reason, and made all moral relations objects of the Reason-the same Reason which apprehends, in itself and in its relations, whatever is: for Reason was with them synonymous with Understanding; and ' the proper objects of tlle Understanding,' as Price remarks, 'are truth, facts, real existence'. Ethics, in this view, was no less a science than Chemistry: it stood on the sanie plane with Mathemiatics, and might be perfected by the resources and processes of Speculative Intelligence which produced the Principia of Newton. Accordiiigly, the whole effort of these writers is directed towards the extension of the Intellectual categories over the area of Morals and the removal of ainy supposed boundary between them. Given the conditions of knowledge, the ethical conceptions and pheno- mena are perfectly provided for. Kant, on the other hand, affirms the incompetency of the Speculative Reason to supply or to warrant the funda- iental categories of Morals ; and refers us to another source within our nature for our idea of what ought to be, with all that it involves. It is true that by allowing it to keep the words 'Vernunft' and 'Erkenntniss,' with the distinguishing epithet ' Practical,' he noininally detains it within the cognitive circle. But by limiting it to an object other than Price's 'proper objects of the Understanding-truith, facts, real existence,' he shows that it has no contact with what the English school means bv ' Reason'. ' It is enough,' he says, 'for me here to explain Theoretical cognition as that whereby I apprehend what exists ; Practical, as that wherebv I conceive what ought to be'. From his mode of treatment it is evident that this Practical Reason is identical with the Moral Self-consciousness; and that it retains for Kant its Rational aspect simply because, by analysing its experiences, it yields up as its postulates certain beliefs, without which its feelings of Obligation, of Guilt, of retributive Justice, would be illusory. The disengagement of these beliefs and organisation of them as a system involve methodical thought and save thenm for intellectual survey. Price, as I have poinited out, hlit upon the distinction between ' Specula- tive ' and ' Moral' Reason, and so far ' approached Kant's ethical position'. But it comes in near the end of his Treatise, on which it has no influence whatever: and his Preface, written later, unreservedly relapses into the Dianoetic view. Kant's doctrine, on the other hand, is drawn not from search among the data or processes of the Understanding, but from direct and separate l Types of Ethical Theory, ii. 442-443.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. 639 analysis of the Moral consciouisness. It is therefore, in its essential principle, ' Idiopsychological'. And it results in acceptinig, instead of explaining away, the leading moral ideas by which the sphere of right and wrong is marked off from that of truth and falsehood. Prof. Sidgwick's note on certain of my statenments about Hutcheson will be valuable to me when I can refer to the passages. Should I bave the opportunity, I shall thanikfully correct any error into which I may have fallen. JAMES MARTINEAU. THE ARISTOTELIAN SOCIETY FOR THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF PHILO- SOPHY.-The concluding nmeeting of the sixth session of the Society was held on Juine 15. All the miembers of the Executive Committee were re-elected for the ensuing Session, which commences Monday, October 26, when the President will deliver an Address on "Philosophy and Ex- perience". The following program for the Session was also agreed to. Five evenings to be devoted to the discussion of Kant's Grundlegung der Metaphysik der Sitten, and of his IKritik der JPraktischen Vernunft; and the remaining eveniings to original papers to be contribluted bv members. Proaram-cards for the session, anld informationi concerningn membership of the Society, may be lhad by application to E. Hawksley Rhodes, Hon. Sec., 22 Albemarle Street, London, W. The " Further Illustrations of Primitive Thought " in Appenclix A. of Mr. Spencer's Principles of Sociology have, in a 31d editioni just issued, been increased threefold. They now fill 52 pp. and are so arranged into a coherent body of evidence that. " even by thenmselves, they wouldc go far to establish the general doctrine set forth in the preceding volume ". It will be seen below that the Revue Philosophique has begun to publish the Proceedings of a "' Societe de Psychologie Physiologique ". The Society was founded in the spring with the object of studying psychical phenomena, both normal and pathological, by the method of observation and experiment; and is to consist of 30 titular mieinbers residing in Paris, with corresponding members in the departments. M. Charcot is Presi- dent; MM. Janet and Ribot, Vice-Presidents; M. Ch. Richet, General Secretary; MM. Ch. Fere and E. Gley, Secretaries; M. Ferrari, Treasurer. Prof. A.
