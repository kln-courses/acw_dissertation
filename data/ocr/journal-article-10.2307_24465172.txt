<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton Quarterly, Vol. 39, No. 1, 2005 "Thine Own Inventions": The Environs of Imagination in Paradise Lost 7 and 8 Andrew Mattison Raphael's descent to Eden, which takes up most of the middle four books of Paradise Lost, is an extraordinary gesture of solidarity from a fundamentally alien being. When Milton describes his long conversation with Adam as "Venial dis course unblam'd" (9.5), the suggestion of kindness and freedom, in addition to its contrast with the later trouble between Heaven and humanity, emphasizes that the "discourse" is an exception to the usual order of things. However, there are several moments, particularly in Books 7 and 8, in which Raphael's anxieties about Adam's capacity to understand and interpret make him a little less kind and a little quicker to blame than Milton's summary suggests. Notable among these moments is Raphael's description of angelic song, which is introduced with the warning that heavenly song's structure is not comprehensible "to human ears" (7.177); rather than stressing the similarity between the praise-songs of angels and those that Adam and Eve sing, he is careful to point out the basic inaccessibility of angelic song. Similarly, Raphael reacts harshly to Adam's attempt at astronomy in Book 8, warning him to "be lowly wise" (8.173); as angelic song was inaccessible to his ear, astronomy is inaccessible to "earthly sight" (8.120). Both of these instances are warnings against intellectual hubris, but against a very particular kind of hubris: the human attempt to understand an inaccessible place, whether heaven or the outer reaches of the created universe. Though Raphael's ostensible subject is dis obedience, much of his anxiety seems to be directed at place. The conversation begins as a warning about the possibility of the Fall, and most criticism (following the lead of Stanley Fish and Regina Schwartz) has assumed that that warning governs the interpretive status of the whole.' The argu ment in this essay, however, will be that much of the conversation becomes a dialectic about the ethics of locative imagination: the obligations and risks associ ated with Adam's understanding of his own surroundings and, more so, his imag ination of Heaven. As the conversation goes on, both participants find issues of place to be of greater and greater consequence. In order to warn Adam about Satan, Raphael must describe events in Heaven; in order to narrate those events, he must confront the question of Adam's ability to understand a place unlike the created world. Though the warning's chief content is about action, in the telling the warning necessarily brings up a problem that seems to be more difficult for Raphael: the human understanding of place. That understanding poses risks, but what makes place particularly a problem is that Raphael, Adam, and God as Adam describes him all seem to have different notions of what those risks are. For this reason, Raphael's original purpose does not end up governing the entire conver sation, as issues distinct from the Fall become central. The difficulty of understanding place in Paradise Lost further complicates several already tense issues in Milton criticism. As Bill Readings points out, Eden 23 © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

However, Eden's conceptual status is not the extent of the problem; instead similarities between problems of description relative to the larger created universe and Heaven as well as Eden suggest that place itself is a fundamental site of the resistance of description and of interpretation in Paradise Lost. Indeed, the difficulties of the imagination of place affect the Miltonic narrator, as well as Raphael and Adam, and create a point of doubt in the transmission of divine insight. Recognizing this fundamental instability resuscitates one part of William Empson's argument about Paradise Lost: that the theodicy of the poem—or as Empson calls it, the effort "to make his God appear less wicked" (11)—is more of a struggle or a search than it is a treatise. In particular, Milton must leave the definition of prelapsarian imagi nation ambiguous, not because it suits a rhetorical goal, but because the nature of that imagination is itself made ambiguous by the problem of place. Such a reading of this conversation suggests a Paradise Lost which is not in any way intended to reassure, but which demonstrates, through the complexity of the problems it explores, the difficulty of the poem's project. The poem's defense of itself is more earnest than its defense of its subject. Like Empson, such a view contends that there is a fundamental discontinuity in Raphael's tutorial: that its length, com plexity, and ambiguity interfere with its ability to realize straightforwardly the divine commandment that caused it. That discontinuity does not mean that the Fall is Raphael's fault or anyone else's, but it prevents any reading in which Raphael is seen as a purveyor of a divinely sanctioned truth of which Adam and Eve are unable to take advantage, a reading most famously defended by Stanley Fish. Fish has summarized succinctly this reading of Raphael as mouthpiece: "Everything Raphael says is an expansion and reformulation of God's crucial and controversial characterization of the unfallen state: 'Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall' (III, 99)" (How Milton Works 527). Such a characterization insufficiently accounts for all of the decisions Raphael makes; in fact, Raphael's unease about Adam's ability to understand the context of his unfallen state becomes a part of the subject of the conversation itself. The inherent difficulty of explaining Adam's state to him means that the possibility of temptation and Fall cannot after all be the only issue in the conversation. Raphael frequently demonstrates his concern that Adam is too eager to imagine things he cannot understand. Even the praise-songs, which are the Heav enly events closest to Adam's own experience since they resemble the prayers and songs Adam and Eve create themselves, are affected by Raphael's difficulty in trans lating them into a human sense of time and place. By asking Adam to imagine events in Heaven, Raphael is already creating a problem for his own message. When Adam's imagination of place is the subject, what is otherwise a confident tutorial becomes a cautious, contradictory, and subtle debate about the limitations of Adam's ability to understand Raphael's subject. Those limitations focus not on events but on the environment of those events; it is harder, it seems, to imagine an inaccessible location than it is to understand any particular event in history, even the history of angels. The problem of environment informs the entire con versation, and in different ways the entire poem; the imagination of place is much more vexing and ultimately much more significant in Paradise Lost than the imag ination of events. In Book 8, Raphael questions Adam's attempts to understand his own universe apart from Heaven, implying that any large-scale understanding of © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="3">Milton Quarterly 25 place, not only heavenly place but worldly place as well, is inaccessible to human thought.3 The problems explored here—Raphael's attempt to tell a narrative whose setting he thinks is off limits to Adam and Adam's simultaneous contrition for and defense of his curiosity—suggest a more dialectical and less catechistic understanding of the conversation, since much of what Raphael and Adam say is informed by a group of related concerns that they share and that Adam has appar ently already been considering. Contrary to what God's intentions might lead us to expect, many of the central concerns of the conversation are not introduced by Raphael as part of his warning but are introduced by the two conversants as consequences of their attempts to share their knowledge. These shared concerns suggest that the impending Fall is not the only issue in the conversation; both Adam and Raphael are already concerned about potential disconnections between Heaven and Eden. Rather than Fish's idea of Raphael's demonstration of a proper and balanced worship or a crucially misunderstood warning (about Satan, about appropriate and inappropriate forms of knowledge, or about sin—a chief expo nent of this reading is R.A. Shoaf) to Adam by Raphael, the conversation may be understood as one in which both Raphael and Adam (and, by extension, Milton as well) are struggling with the problem of how to reconcile Adam's overreach ing imagination with a universe that simultaneously requires his ignorance and celebrates his imagination. Milton critics have been aware for some time that much of what Raphael says is tinged with an awareness of the possibility of its failure. That awareness, charged from the start, becomes even greater in the latter half of the conversa tion, in which Raphael answers Adam's questions about creation and the nature of the created world.6 But the idea of Raphael's imminent failure demands an examination of what Raphael is trying to do in the first place, particularly in those latter books. Fish finds the most succinct statement of Raphael's goal in his request that Adam view "the Heav'n's wide Circuit" in a way that can "speak / The Maker's high magnificence" (8.100—01). For Fish the passage indicates a more Miltonic way of reading the heavens (How Milton Works 63). But the passage comes after Adam's attempt at astronomy, and can be read as responsive: a part of Raphael's correction of Adam's hubris. Raphael's adjectives, "wide," "high," attempt to mold Adam's understanding of environment on a basic level; he wants Adam to read width as height—that is, to understand the great size and complexity of the universe as indicating its remoteness from human understand ing. It may be that Adam is willing to accept that reading, at least temporarily, of the heavens as they are in relation to Eden, but Raphael's own narrative prevents Adam from thinking of the Heaven of angels in the same way. The size of the sky might encourage praise of God, but the remoteness of Heaven makes praising God harder. In Adam's most conciliatory acceptance of Raphael's warning of the danger of imagination, he states the risk entirely in terms of place: But apt the Mind or Fancy is to rove Uncheckt, and of her roving is no end; Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learn That not to know at large of things remote From use, obscure and subtle, but to know © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="4">26 Andrew Mattison That which before us lies in daily life, Is the prime Wisdom [. . .] (8.188-94) To speak of imagination as "roving" is already to suggest what the problem is for Raphael and Adam both: at least on a figurative level, Adam is assuming here that when one imagines something, one's imagination is effectively there. Thus Adam's metaphor for safe thinking is "That which before us lies": suggesting not only "daily life" but also, to take the metaphor literally, one's immediate physical surroundings; Adam seems not to make the distinction between the literal and figurative meanings. Adam's rejection of "things remote / From use," beyond the etymological extension of "unusual," is a metaphor of place. Milton's line break is meaningful; Adam is concerned about "things remote": the imagina tion of place beyond the garden. In fact, the main thing he is apologizing for here is his own inquiry into astronomy (a passage discussed in detail below), and the word "remote" is in his mind in that context. Raphael earlier explained the dis torting effects of astronomical observation using the same word; he says of the stars: By tincture or reflection they augment Thir small peculiar, though from human sight So far remote, with diminution seen. (7.367-69) For Raphael, then, remoteness is specific to perception, not just location: the stars are "remote" "from human sight." Adam (with or without Raphael's en couragement) associates literal remoteness (remoteness from human perception) with figurative remoteness (remoteness from human understanding). Because of that association, the gratitude Adam implies in response to Raphael's warning not to worry about "things remote" would seem to conflict with the gratitude he continually expresses for Raphael's accounts of things to which he would not ordinarily have access.7 Adam's eager acceptance of Raphael's warning is not final; on the contrary, it is qualified if not countered by the rest of the conversation. Despite Raphael's stated desire to influence Adam's thought, he does not make much effort to control the content of the conversation, which is remarkably inter active; its latter half consists mostly of Raphael's responses to Adam's questions. For that reason, the imaginative curiosity for which Adam is so apologetic in the lines quoted above actually governs the entire exchange, which is about knowledge beyond "what concerns thee and thy being" (8.174); in fact, the ostensible reason for the conversation is that the danger of temptation makes it necessary for Adam and Eve to consider some larger issues than those of their daily life. Raphael's function in these books is to provide Adam with precisely the kind of knowledge he tells Adam not to want. For Raphael, the discrepancy between the need to answer Adam's questions and his concerns about the appropriateness of Adam's intellectual ambition pre vents him from answering those questions with much confidence; he is eager to © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="5">Milton Quarterly 27 avoid becoming an authority on the kinds of knowledge that are only partially available to Adam and Eve. When introducing to Adam the subject of the history of Heaven, and frequently thereafter, Raphael warns him of the difficulty of describing Heaven within "the reach / Of human sense" (5.571—72), as if to apol ogize in advance. (When Raphael calls telling the story of the War in Heaven a "Sad task and hard" [5.564], he is offering a similar apology both for the inac cessibility of the subject matter and for his own emotional difficulty in relating it.) Thus, throughout the conversation, Raphael reminds Adam of the inherent problems in a conversation designed to both enhance and check Adam's knowl edge, by reiterating warnings for Adam not to overstep his intellectual bounds while requiring Adam's full creative participation in the conversation. What Raphael offers to Adam is a locative dualism, in which places inacces sible to Adam can only be understood through fuzzy analogies with accessible places. Against the difficulty of describing heavenly events to a human ear Raphael rather tentatively offers the unity of creation: [. . .] what if Earth Be but the shadow of Heav'n, and things therein Each to other like more than on Earth is thought? (5.574-76) Raphael's consolation suggests the way he is thinking about the problem of imagining Heaven from Adam's point of view: things and events are determined by their setting, so that what goes on in Heaven is, to Adam, merely "invisible exploits" (5.565); Raphael contrasts that invisibility with the more expressible life on Earth. Raphael's formulation shows that the representation of angels or other heavenly occupants is not in itself the problem for his narrative. Just as Adam can accept that Raphael is a spirit in corporeal form, Raphael expects Adam to imagine that the things he is describing are superficially similar even if fundamentally dif ferent from the way that Adam must imagine them. The problem is Heaven itself: he is trying to locate a narrative in a setting that, because time and space are not structured there as they are on Earth, resists narrative.8 This anti-narrative context, however, is not Raphael's problem alone; Adam experiences something very similar in trying to describe Eden back to Raphael. Raphael wants Adam to make an ironclad distinction between Earth and Heaven, but to Raphael, Adam's attempt to make sense of the divine logic of creation suggests that he either unwilling or unable to make that distinction. Well before Adam's troubling thought experiments, Raphael is already strug gling with the presentation of events whose surroundings are not accessible to Adam. Raphael's descriptions of angelic song, far from being the emblem of perfect worship (as Schwartz has read them), are in fact loci of the intensity of Raphael's anxiety about the human imagination of Heaven.9 Raphael does seem to intend song to be the aspect of creation most comprehensible to Adam; he considers praise, its basic subject, to be one with which Adam ought to be concerned. But he also stresses, both directly and indirectly, that the audience of angelic song is itself necessarily angelic. Because angelic song is sung in Heaven, it is already too remote for Adam to fully understand. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="6">28 Andrew Mattison Part of the function of these songs is to describe the culture of Heaven; they are glimpses into the way creation works. After all of Raphael's talk about the esotericism of creation, Adam might expect a description of an obscure, isolated creator. Instead, after God's announcement that the Son will take charge, Raphael reiterates the impossibility of human knowledge within an image of a rather public creation: So spake th'Almighty, and to what he spake His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. Immediate are the acts of God, more swift Than time or motion, but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notion can receive. Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heav'n When such was heard declar'd the Almighty's will; Glory they sung to the most High [. . .] (7.174-82) The requirements of that publicity seem to be at odds with Raphael's under standing of the temporality of creation. The progression of ideas here sounds like non sequitur: if the acts of God are indeed "more swift / Than time" then there could not be enough time for the apparently centrally significant angelic song. Both the temporal and conceptual connotations of the word "Immediate" (176) cause a certain amount of puzzlement here: if the actualization of God's creation is indeed instant, then it is not clear when the "triumph and rejoicing" takes place (180), but there is a broader question of immediacy as well, since one wonders what the function of the singing is if not to provide some form of mediation— an explanation, an interpretation, or at least a confirmation of God's acts. On the contrary, the effect of the problem of time is to divorce the praise of the act from the act itself, since the praise is available to "human ears" (177) only in a way that does not fit with Raphael's narrative of creation. Raphael's description of creation emphasizes its instantaneousness, and it is clear that whatever knowledge Raphael is attempting to convey to Adam, the idea of the instantaneousness of God's acts matters to that knowledge. If song, translated into human language, is not instan taneous, then it would seem that Raphael is making a distinction, already, between Adam's understanding of creation itself and Adam's knowledge of the angelic response to creation. Raphael requires him to understand that creation is instan taneous, but does not seem to think that he could imagine song as anything other than extended. The sheer presence of song acts as a means of connection between Adam's worship and angelic worship, but the instantaneousness of the context of the song interferes with that connection and prevents Adam from understanding heavenly music in terms of his music. Complicating the temporal issue, Raphael says that the Son began his mission during the song: "Meanwhile the Son / On his great Expedition now appear'd" (7.192-93). Raphael's insistence on the difference between the immediate reality and the necessity of time in his narration suggests that the duration of the song is a con venience for Adam's sake, and that the Son in fact appears in his chariot imme diately upon God's pronouncement. The contradiction stresses the physical nature © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="7">Milton Quarterly 29 of Raphael's speech "to human ears" (177). The idea of an instantaneous action that takes more time to be told than to happen makes sense to anyone, but accord ing to "earthly notion" (179), that model cannot be applied to music; music's inter est in repetition (an interest reflected in the very organized structure of Raphael's songs) means that it exists by definition in time. Just as Raphael refers to speech literally even as he uses "His Word" as a metaphor, the song here is in part a metaphor as well, in this case a metaphor for some instantaneous expression by the singers. The angelic songs Raphael discusses are more than simply praise of creation, because they are so carefully placed in close proximity to creation itself. They are, in fact, responses to creation, further demonstrating the distinction between heav enly song and edenic song, which is simply praise. The specificity of the songs' function requires Raphael to comment on the formal aspects of the song: struc ture and audience. Those aspects give him trouble, as becomes clear in the most specific song, the one just before the beginning of creation. The past perfect tense of the verbs describing God's actions indicates that Raphael reports rather than quotes the content of the song: Glory they sung to the most High, good will To future men, and in thir dwellings peace; Glory to him whose just avenging ire Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight And th' habitations of the just; to him Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd Good out of evil to create, instead Of Spirits malign a better Race to bring Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. So sang the Hierarchies [. . .] (7.182-91) The song begins and ends with God's current project, the world and "future men"; in between it covers recent heavenly history (hence those past perfects).The theme of the song is the relationship between the history and the project ("Good out of evil" [188]); the climax is contained in the word "thence" (190), which succinctly suggests the continuity of all of God's actions in the poem. If this song happens instantaneously, if music here is a metaphor for something else, the content of the song would suggest that the metaphor is for the angels' acknowledgment of the continuity of divine decision-making. The song indicates and celebrates the angelic understanding of the unity of the divine project, which depends on the angels' access to the whole; its instantaneousness, its ability to present itself at once to its heavenly audience, allows this vision of the glory of creation. In that sense, the songs of praise are Raphael's careful reminder to Adam that earthly praise is not the same as heavenly praise. On the other hand, the triple repetition of "Glory," always at the beginning of the line and with one more line between the second and third than between the first and second, is choral; it suggests not only repe tition but structured repetition, so that even with Raphael's heavenly non-time the musical ordering of time still applies. But the structure is more than simple rep etition. The last sentence, from the last "Glory," opens up into a larger phrase with © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="8">30 Andrew Mattison a grand crescendo, rising over two enjambments: the rapid movement from the small space of the "vacant room" to the massive one of "Worlds and Ages infi nite" (190—91). The structure suggests an expanding sound in the moment of an expanding universe. The structure of the "glory" song is mirrored in the final song in Raphael's narrative of creation: Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, Open, ye Heav'ns, your living doors; let in The great Creator from his work return'd Magnificent, his Six days' work, a World; Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign To visit oft the dwellings of just Men Delighted, and with frequent intercourse Thither will send his winged Messengers On errands of supernal grace. (7.565-73) Once again, the crucial word, "Open," is repeated three times; once again, there is more space between the second and third than between the first and second, and as with "Glory," the final repetition is followed by a longer coda. This repeated structure is significant. It cannot be coincidence that the two songs have the same form; the repetition implies genre. But the genre is not traditional song form, which would be ABA: two similar entities interrupted by a contrasting middle section. The form of Raphael's angelic songs is AAB; the traditional organization is reversed. In both songs, the third statement connects the first two to a larger time-scale and a larger function, and incorporates a much more complex meta physics; to describe the world as "Magnificent" is praise; but to imagine "the dwellings of just Men" (570) is an extracurricular bit of prophecy. The form of the angels' song, established by repetition, includes a final idea that moves beyond praise. Even as he urges praise, Raphael makes clear that praise cannot be sepa rated from the greater anxieties caused by the limits of human understanding. Raphael describes angelic song as having a subject, praise, that is accessible to Adam, a form that both includes him and moves beyond what Raphael thinks of as his capabilities, and a context that is inaccessible to human beings. Neither time nor space functions in Heaven as it does on Earth, and music needs to be heard in time (or it has no structure) and space (or it has no audience, not to mention acoustics).These contradictions represent the greater contradictions involved in the relationship Raphael describes between Heaven and Eden. Raphael never gives Adam, in Book 7, a clear idea of what the boundary is between the two, even as he repeatedly insists on the importance of that boundary. For this reason, it is not surprising that when Adam begins discussing his own experience and observations he is primarily concerned with location, since that is the issue with which Raphael has left him the greatest doubt. Not only is Adam not sure where he is, he does not even know to what extent he can know where he is. Raphael does not help him. Adam's questions, some of which Raphael answers and some of which he suggests Adam should not have asked in the first place, structure Book 8. Most ot © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="9">Milton Quarterly 31 those questions concern place, and in fact most come back to the very question I have suggested Raphael has trouble with himself: how possible it is and how necessary it is for Adam to understand the nature of environment, both his own and that of the angels. The first question of Adam's life, as he narrates it to Raphael, is the question that continues to occupy him during the conversation: [. . .] Thou Sun, said I, fair Light, And thou enlight'n'd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, ^oods, and Plains And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? (8.273-77) Adam seems to make a direct connection between the characteristics he observes of the natural world around him—its variety, its beauty, its brightness—and his decision to ask that world his question. In that sense, he is suggesting that the two questions he asks, how did I become and how did I become here (277), are ver sions of the same question; that is, if Adam understood how he came to be a part of the "enlight'n'd Earth," he would understand necessarily how he came to be at all. As we will see, this version of Adam's basic question is aptly placed after Raphael's description of creation and warnings not to think too much about the nature of the universe. For Adam, the separation Raphael calls for between his understanding of himself and his function and his understanding of the world around him is essentially impossible. Of course, Adam mostly accepts Raphael's insistence that the solution to the problem is simply not to try to imagine the unimaginable. However, there is a sig nificant sub-strain within Adam's conciliation, particularly in his account of the creation of Eve. Adam's portrayal of a God who not only approves of but responds materially to Adam's imagination is a defense of his ability to understand his location. The defense never becomes explicit, however, because Adam has no answer to Raphael's warnings of the danger his intellect presents. It is not alto gether clear whether the amount of thought about environment that is necessary simply to live in and understand Eden might itself carry a fair amount of risk. Adam proceeds carefully, presenting alternatively ambitious and self-effacing inter pretations of his environment, as if testing for Raphael's approbation. Ultimately, however, his previous conversation with God indicates that Adam is determined not to give up on his attempts to make sense of his surroundings. From the moment of his creation, Adam thinks of himself as a part of a larger landscape: [. . .] As new wak't from soundest sleep Soft on the flow'ry herb I found me laid In Balmy Sweat, which with his Beams the Sun Soon dri'd, and on the reeking moisture fed. (8.253-56) At first glance there are two distinct connections with the landscape here. "The flow'ry herb" describes a passive environment, the sun an active one. But there are © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="10">32 Andrew Mattison several features that combine the two into an environment in which Adam's place is difficult to determine. The use of "soft" as an adverb here is surely more than just slightly elevated diction: within ordinary Miltonic hyperbaton,11 the line can also suggest "soft" as an adjective modifying "herb." "Laid" can have at least two meanings, one directly transitive, assuming that someone as yet unknown had laid Adam in that spot, as well as an intransitive one that only implies that Adam is lying there (the QED, as one meaning of "to be laid," gives "to lie down," includ ing Renaissance citations).Thus, the care with which God has placed Adam, Adam's relaxation, and the malleability of the surface he is resting on all exist in the word "soft." Adam perceives the world as personified, and at the same time, the world is charged with the deliberate choices of its creators. The personification both con nects Adam to his environment by suggesting that the environment cares for him, and disconnects him by making the process of that care so mysterious. ~ From Adam's birth, then, he has reason to be confused about his own place in the landscape. Immediately after this moment Adam discovers the whole world at once: [. . .] about me round I saw Hill, Dale, and shady Woods, and sunny Plains, And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, Creatures that liv'd, and mov'd , and walk'd, or flew, Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, With fragrance and with joy mv heart o'erflow'd. (8.261-66) Here, the personification ("all things smil'd") explicitly refers to the entire landscape, physical, vegetable, and animal, at once. Adam discovers the world as a place as friendly to him as whoever put him there. Adam's instant reckoning of landscape at the moment after his creation anticipates a natural world that will continue to include him. Adam expects a kind of pathetic fallacy turned true, a landscape that both smiles at him and smiles with him. But he discovers very early in his life that he is not going to get that perfect environmental connec tion; almost immediately after this passage, Adam's discovery that "answer none return'd" to his call (285) makes him "pensive" (287). The beginnings of Adam's loneliness, which he describes to God a few lines later, are so close to his discov ery of landscape as to be inseparable; Adam's wonder leads directly to his anxiety. As his doubts about astronomy will demonstrate, that anxiety is still developing after the creation of Eve. After the Fall, Adam has many more significant doubts than these about man's connection to the environment, but his uncertainty about landscape exists even before the Fall. That uncertainty could be evidence of a fall that is already clairvoyantly present, but is, in fact, the chief of a related group of concerns that exist within Adam's world because they are fundamental to the world God created. Whereas Book 7 was an extended metaphysical tutorial with Raphael as master and the unity (however complex and obscure) of the world as subject, Book 8 is a dialogue in which Adam brings up increasingly pointed doubts about the unity of the world from his own perspective. Hoping that Raphael will assuage these doubts ("only thy solution can resolve" [8.14]), Adam begins © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="11">Milton Quarterly 33 with a question about the proportions of the respective motions of planetary bodies: When I behold this goodly Frame, this World Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a grain, An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd And all her number'd Stars, that seem to roll Spaces incomprehensible (for such Thir distance argues, and thir swift return Diurnal) merely to officiate light Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, One day and night; in all thir vast survey Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire, How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions, with superfluous hand So many nobler Bodies to create, Greater so manifold to this one use, For aught appears, and thir Orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated, while the sedentary Earth, That better might with far less compass move, Serv'd by more noble than herself, attains Her end without least motion, and receives, As Tribute such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; Speed to describe whose swiftness Number fails. (8.15-38) Adam responds to Raphael's complex and esoteric pedagogy by creating the most syntactically sophisticated sentence of his short life. After Raphael's at times elegant and complex depiction of creation, Adam wishes to show that he can describe his own surroundings with comparable skill, but at the same time the complexity of his argument reveals the extent of his uncertainty. The main verb of the sentence is "admire" in line 25, a verb of so much doubt that even its doubtfulness is uncer tain, and Raphael uses it in the other, certain meaning in response, warning that God has prevented "His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought / rather admire" (8.74—75). The OED cites line 19 as its first use of the word "roll" in this pecu liar, transitive meaning. Invention and complexity are everywhere here, but there is considerable caution in the rather vague "commit /such disproportions" (26—27) and considerable anxiety about the remoteness of creation revealed in the distance between the charged word "create" (28) and its subject, the neither divine nor not divine "Nature" (26). However, though his doubts bother Adam, it is also clear to him and to Raphael that he is very good at expressing them. What bothers Adam in particular is proportion: the heavenly bodies move such distances and at such speeds "merely to officiate light / Round this opacous Earth." Adam's "merely," like Yeats's "mere anarchy," refers more to the greatness of what is notably absent than to the paucity of what is present; he is not deni grating the earth, but having gotten a sense of the vastness of the universe, he now © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="12">34 Andrew Mattison understands relativity. He could accept more easily that he is the center of the world if that circumstance did not seem to require such effort of the universe. Of course, Raphael's decidedly large-scale description of creation reinforces the dis crepancy between the small but needy earth and the huge and generous cosmos. That troublesome proportion is in part a form of inefficiency ("in all thir vast survey / Useless besides"), but he is also very aware that the universe's inefficiency is the product of his own, and the earth's, uniqueness. It is interesting that Adam questions speed and not motion. He does not argue that the unity of the world prevents any motion within it (the thesis of Parmenides); his logic is not even nec essarily metaphysical, in that the essence of astronomical bodies does not concern him nearly as much as how they behave in relation to him. He questions not what the stars do but how much they do. His image is almost of a laboring universe, and he thinks of that labor in terms of its product. In that sense, Adam is relying on personification to understand the relationships among heavenly bodies. For a human being, to travel a greater distance is always more tiring. On the other hand, when Adam remarks that his current understanding of the universe would require the planets to possess "Speed, to describe whose swift ness Number fails" (38), he is talking not about impossibility but about inde scribability. The choice is significant, since Adam is already experimenting with ways of describing relativity: "this Earth a spot, a grain, / An Atom (17—18)," search ing for the best and smallest metonymy, suggests a very sophisticated understand ing of perspective. The implication is that Adam could use a relative measurement to describe the speed of the planets, but even that measurement would be insuf ficient. By imagining the scale of the universe through analogy or metonymy, he can get a sense of its impressiveness, but his inability to conceive of a mathemat ics that would go up, so to speak, to the speed that would be necessary for the model he has in mind still seems to him to be a failure. He expects from Raphael either a different model, which would be comprehensible for what knowledge of physics Adam commands, or a different methodology for understanding the current model, which would require a still more powerful sense of relativity in description. To a limited extent, Raphael gives him both. He describes various other possible structures for the relationship between Earth and the other bodies, but at the same time, Raphael wants to move Adam closer to an idea in which he could be the center of nature and dwarfed by it simultaneously, without contradiction: Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries Officious, but to thee Earth's habitant. And for the Heav'n's wide Circuit, let it speak The Maker's high magnificence, who built So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so far; That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill [. . .] (8.98-104) The final two lines of this passage contain the essence of Raphael's paradox: the purpose of the nature of the universe is human development and education, but © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="13">Milton Quarterly 35 the actual lesson is humility, and of course Raphael is preaching a kind of blind acceptance; he does not appease Adam's doubts so much as urge Adam not to have them, "let it speak / The Maker's high magnificence" (100—01) is a command to think of significance as distinct from description. Raphael attempts to change Adam's understanding of meaning in relation to environment to one in which all meaning is essentially praise. In doing so, he poses what becomes a central ques tion of Book 8: is praise sufficient, or is knowledge needed distinct from praise? According to Raphael's method, if a workable model of the cosmos is impossible, God is that much more impressive. Raphael clearly understands that the question of the layout of heavenly bodies is only part of the problem; Adam's expectation that he can formulate a science that will account for that layout is the reason for Raphael's talk about knowledge. When Adam tells Raphael his own story somewhat later on, it becomes clear that Raphael's lesson was not sufficient, if only because Adam's ideas about his place in the world are already more sophisticated. Adam perceives instantly that he must be humble, but that perception does not prevent him from questioning his status (though this level of questioning is acceptable to both God and Raphael). But through that questioning Adam returns to the idea that a sophisticated under standing of place, in particular the difference between Heaven and Eden, is nec essary in order to live as God wishes. This idea is a version of Adam's anxiety over the speed of astronomical bodies: what understanding he has impresses him, but it does not satisfy him. Adam understands the significance of God's statement that "all the earth / to thee and to thy race I give" (8.338-39). He is not ungrateful; he genuinely appreciates [. . .] all this good to man, for whose well being So amply, and with hands so liberal, Thou hast provided all things [. . .] (8.361-63) Adam does have a knowledge of the complexity of the universe that functions, like Raphael's description, as praise. But he cannot stop there; he cannot limit his understanding of his surroundings to a notion of their generosity. Adam sees himself surrounded, yet alone, because he sees his surroundings not as extensions and aids to himself, but as arrangements of discrete entities. He only recognizes that the animals are arranged in pairs, for example (in a passage quoted below), because he is interested in them in relation to each other and not just to himself. This interest is perhaps not so remarkable in itself, but the speed with which Adam arrives at it is; within moments of recognizing his place in the world, he per ceives that his solitude is unique, and assumes that, being unique, it must also be undesirable: [. . .] In solitude What happiness, who can enjoy alone, Or all enjoying, what contentment find? (8.364-66) © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="14">36 Andrew Mattison If Adam's question about astronomy demonstrates the way his mind works, the leap to loneliness here makes sense. The peculiar type of personification Adam employs, one in which the personified landscape is always divided into discrete entities comparable to himself, leads him to object, once again, to a perceived dis crepancy between him and everyone else.lD Without the personification of the animals, he would have no comparison that would allow him to conceptualize solitude. God's response suggests that Adam should get companionship enough from the world God created for him: What call'st thou solitude? is not the Earth With various living creatures, and the Air Replenisht, and all these at thy command To come and play before thee; know'st thou not Thir language and thir ways? (8.369-73) Unlike Raphael, God does not ask Adam to see his environment without dis tinctions between discrete parts. The difference between Adam's and God's under standings of the Garden here has to do with the kinds of connections possible. God wants Adam to recognize connections of all types, and take different kinds of comfort in different ones. But the only connections that Adam sees are, essen tially, sexual ones: [. . .] the brute Cannot be human consort; they rejoice Each with thir kind, Lion with Lioness; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd [. . .] (8.391-94) Just as the description of the universe meant to Adam accounting for the rela tionship between earth and the planets, the categorization of fauna means rethink ing relationships between categories. If all animals were unique, Adam might be willing to accept a simple hierarchy, but since all animals other than Adam arrange themselves in pairs, Adam perceives something from which he is excluded that is built into his environment. God's suggestion that the world exists for Adam's enjoy ment is belied, for Adam, by the very existence of "kind" (393). God's term, "Replenisht" (371), indeed implies a much vaguer sense of creation than Adam's "combin'd," as if God preferred to think of reproduction as independent from species, and from sex. But Adam reminds God that this state of affairs is his doing; the extra clause—"So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd" (394)—is not actu ally relevant to Adam's argument that species determines social compatibility, nor is it intended as mere flattery; the word "fitly" is a reminder to God that arrang ing things in pairs is actually a more logical way of doing it. It also represents a certain amount of imaginative ambition on Adam's part, since to define one way of being as "fit" is necessarily to imagine and reject other ways of being: Adam can picture himself in a pair, or can picture the animals in his solitary state. Though © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="15">Milton Quarterly 37 this observation of God's power is in the form of praise, beyond praise it is inter ested in the way that power is put to use. Remarkably, God's response to Adam's imaginative ambition is to suggest an even more ambitious act: imagining God himself. If Adam can take no pleasure in solitude, God wonders: What think'st thou then of mee, and this my State, Seem I to thee sufficiently possest Of happiness, or not? who am alone From all Eternity, for none I know Second to mee or like, equal much less. (8.403-07) God's characterization of himself is the opposite of the rather mystical praise Raphael had in mind; he is asking Adam to think about the nature of God's rela tionship to his creation, not simply his status as its creator. The question is a reduc tio ad absurdam, a form that depends on imagining other perspectives. God asks Adam to experiment, to hypothesize, in thinking about divine nature. Responding to Adam's interest in making connections between things of disparate categories, God makes a connection so stretched as to create what a logician would call a cat egory error: the application of a predicate to a subject that does not belong to the category of things that take that predicate. To question whether God is happy is surely an absurd degree of anthropomorphism. God's question goes in two direc tions at once; on the one hand, it mocks Adam's willingness to think of the bestial pleasure in sexual connection as one necessary for his own happiness by compar ing it to a clear category error. On the other hand, by asking Adam to think about whether or not it is possible to imagine the emotional life of an infinite being, God is approving Adam's willingness to think beyond the immediate—his own state—and to consider himself authorized to contemplate the greatest questions. Of course, Adam's answer is the only one possible: [. . .] To attain The highth and depth of thy Eternal ways All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things [. . .] (8.412-14) It is the necessary answer, but by phrasing his answer in this way Adam does point out a distinction between imagining the state of God and imagining alternatives to his own state. That is, his answer is not that the analogy God has made is of a sort that cannot or should not be made; he says only that he cannot answer it because it happens to be beyond his abilities. He never abandons (and God, unlike Raphael, never asks him to abandon) his theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between himself and his environment. Eventually God admits that the sexual connection is indeed more close than the connections Adam has available to him already, and in fact asserts that he had always planned to provide Adam another human: Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, And find thee knowing not of Beasts alone, © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="16">38 Andrew Mattison Which thou has rightly nam'd, but of thyself, Expressing well the spirit within thee free, My Image, not imparted to the Brute, Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike [. . .] (8.437-43) What separates Adam from the animals, the freedom of his soul, is the same thing that allows Adam to recognize that separation. In other words, God affirms that it is only by thinking about the world around him not just as it relates to his use and pleasure and to the praise of God but in itself—that it is only by contem plating the meaning of the world around him—that Adam achieves his human ness. Given that Adam reports this conversation immediately after Raphael tells him not to worry about astronomy, it does not seem like much of a stretch to read Adam's anecdote as a very subtle and very polite rebuke to Raphael's instruc tion, and as evidence that Adam's apologetic acquiescence to that instruction was, at best, temporary.16 It is important to Adam that his imagination of place has not only been acceptable to God in the past, but has actually done him some good. Adam uses his conversation with God to defend himself from Raphael's accu sation that he is thinking too much, but God still leaves Adam in a somewhat precarious intellectual position. The creation of Eve answers Adam's immediate question, since it abates his loneliness, but it notably fails to respond to the under lying question: what is supposed to be the relationship between human and envi ronment?17 How close does God expect that connection to be? Adam and God seem to agree that the kinds of connections that God has with the world, the connection of creator to created, are not available to Adam. But Adam refuses to find the kind of connection he has with Eve in his landscape. His need to observe and describe nature prevents him from a completely cooperative model, in which nature's ability to provide for him would not need examination. Throughout his life, Adam makes a distinction between what merely sustains him and what cannot be taken for granted. Of course, the whole problem seems to be something God wants Adam to go through. In their debate, God demonstrates his reason for delaying introducing Eve: he wants Adam to conceive of the possibility of multiple forms of connec tions. In particular, he wants Adam to be able to recognize an incomplete con nection and long for a better one, a basic skill of any religious person. But the process leaves Adam with a problem; since he does not know what to do with the incomplete connections, he has particular trouble understanding how to relate to landscape. This problem puts Raphael in a difficult position, since he must simul taneously give Adam a larger idea of his surroundings by describing the history of Heaven while trying to put some limits on Adam's investigations of the nature of the world. It is reasonable for Raphael to ask Adam to concentrate on the local, since the remote is the problem, but the local inevitably involves the remote. If the remote is at issue in any discussion of place, and if the remote is dangerous in itself, then there does not seem to be any safe way for Adam to think about his surroundings. If it is unsafe for Adam to contemplate the nature of the environment, and unsatisfactory if not dangerous for Raphael to describe a physically inaccessible environment, then the poetic description of that environment, after the fact, would © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="17">Milton Quarterly 39 seem to come under question as well. Milton's ambition to create a comprehen sible version of both Heaven and Eden puts him in a similar position to Raphael's. As much as the physical distance and strangeness of Heaven, remoteness of time is a problem for Milton, a problem he acknowledges by never quite making the distinction between the prelapsarian time he is describing and the history that has passed since. His description of Eden seems to have trouble sticking to a particu lar kind of temporal setting. It is clearly important to him (as it is to Adam) to stress the interconnectedness of the Edenic landscape: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling Vine Lays forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; meanwhile murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crown'd Her crystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir choir apply; airs, vernal airs, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance Led on th' Eternal Spring. (4.257-68) Milton's vines are almost seductive and the presence of Pan fascinating, but the birds are even more striking. Milton interprets birdsong simultaneously as formal and formed music and as so much a part of the landscape itself that it induces a double synesthesia: smell becomes the breath of song; leaves shaking in the wind become harmonic vibration. Air (surely the pun is deliberate)'8 can exist in a dis tinct natural state to be smelled even as it takes on the already personified musical agenda of the birds in order to extend their music, in the style of an Aeolian harp, to the leaves. As the waters "unite thir streams" (263), Milton's "Breathing" in line 265 unites the birds, the air, the fields, and the leaves into a single musical project. Infinite complexity—those grapevines, "mantling" themselves over every thing (258), "Luxuriant" (260), are principally responsible for the feeling of excess in this passage—and infinite unity are in accord. That wildly tamed personification occurs at the end of the description, encir cling it with descriptive immediacy. It begins, however, with a different kind of immediacy: the nearness to Eden both of creation and of fall: [. . .] in this pleasant soil His far more pleasant Garden God ordain'd; Out of the fertile ground he caus'd to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by, Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. Southward through Eden went a River large, © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="18">40 Andrew Mattison Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggy hill Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd Upon the rapid current [. . .] (4.214-27) The rhetorical device of "he caus'd to grow" and the metaphor involved in "God had thrown / That Mountain," are hard to describe (the latter suggests, in com parison to a potter's wheel, that the motion involved is circular, physical, and quick, whereas the former is gradual and organic). Milton begins with a grand anthro pomorphism, making God a gardener and also, with the interest in "sight, smell, taste" (217), someone who appreciates what he tends, as Adam and Eve will later. He ends with a description of river and hill that suggests personification, so that God seems to be grappling with a landscape that plays along. The juxtaposition is striking, and the description of the two trees makes clear why it is there: Eden is so saturated with meaning that the immediate association of the Tree of Knowl edge with our death takes nothing away from the power of the Tree of Life. The description of Eden has a number of concerns; the prelapsarian mean ingfulness of the Edenic landscape is one of those concerns, while the postlapsar ian futility of landscape is another. To refer to the tree specifically as "Death" (221) is to introduce a suggestion of a different kind of landscape, the kind that will later emerge starkly in Book 10, at the very center of Eden. The different gardens present are intertwined; death, bacchic exuberance, the heavy presence of creation, and pastoral unity all exist at once. The description is quoted out of order to suggest that there is no linear direction governing these contradictory elements; they are parallel. Death, in the form of the Tree of Knowledge, comes before the eternal spring, but it could just as easily go the other way, and certainly the reader is expected to remember that temporally the order is as quoted, not as Milton writes it. Any attempt to account for Milton's inclusion of a clearly postlapsarian description of the landscape of Eden must say more than that the description is not from Adam's point of view and his innocence does not apply to it. The ambiva lence of the description so closely mirrors Adam's own ambivalence about land scape in Book 8, in which there seems to be no way to describe the world that does not include danger, that the landscape's lack of innocence seems to apply retroactively to Adam. Adam seems to be responding to a property of landscape that is built into it throughout Paradise Lost, even though both he and Raphael identify the problem as having to do with the limits of his knowledge. Like Adam, Milton cannot seem to find a way to describe Edenic landscape that does not include the possibility of the Fall, as if a truly innocent Eden were literally unimag inable. But it is not necessary to ascribe the presence of the Fall to the potential of the Fall; landscape itself, as Milton describes continually, reaches toward the Fall. Milton cannot intend his readers to disregard Raphael's warnings about ambi tious imagination, but he is careful to include with those warnings a sense of the necessity of the kind of imagination that is so dangerous, along with an acknowl edgment that Milton's project itself depends on that imagination. This duality informs Paradise Lost as a whole; the poem has much in common with Raphael's praise songs, but its praise exists in a very unsettled context. For Milton's readers to take sides, as it were, in the conflict between praise and ambitious knowledge © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="19">Milton Quarterly 41 would be beside the point; Milton includes both because the two are inseparable. But the conflict inevitably comes back to environment. The problem with angelic song is not the subject of the song but the setting of the song in heavenly time and space; the problem with Adam's understanding of astronomy is not the scien tific principle involved but the anxiety inherent in the human relationship with the Edenic landscape. Both of these examples are about the ethics of imagination: the moral difficulty involved in understanding something inaccessible. However, Milton's own difficulties in describing Eden demonstrate that environment is not by happenstance a representation of intellectual conflicts in the poem but that environment is itself the locus of those conflicts. The difficulty of imagining the inaccessible then is not ultimately a moral problem in Paradise Lost; it is a problem of description. The conflicts and contradictions outlined here arise from Milton's project itself: the poetic depiction of prelapsarian Eden. The remoteness of Eden renders its description essentially impossible; Milton hedges against that problem by including a sense of future in the description in the form of the ref erence to the Fall: a connection to, and therefore beyond, the transforming event that has caused the inaccessibility of Eden. But the hedge works only partially, because there is no way to separate Raphael's and Adam's dialectic from the inac cessible settings it continually invokes. Because remoteness is a quality of place, setting is more affected by inaccessibility than anything within a setting. In that sense, one possible response to Raphael's advice that the greatness of the universe should signify the greatness of God is that the greatness of God is easier to make sense of; place cannot be a route toward religious understanding if place is itself incomprehensible. Raphael is doomed by his own project; he is trying to use place—the immediacy of Adam's function within Eden—to create certainty, but the project is undermined by the uncertainty that governs environment throughout. Raphael's predicament shows the power of place: the indescribability of Eden presents a serious obstacle to a discourse of the human condition and the Fall. Brandeis University Notes Fish's 1967 book Surprised by Sin provides a reading of the passage clarified and further developed, but essentially unchanged, in his recent How Milton Works. Schwartz's focuses more on Raphael's dis cussion of heavenly actions in which Adam can participate, such as praise, but still regards the warning as the interpretive center of the conversation. 2 After the Fall, according to Readings, and after Michael's already somewhat revisionist reading of postlapsarian history, Eden as such becomes accessible only indirectly through a sort of self-history: "The immediate truth of Eden is disbarred, and has been transferred into the realm of subjective historical speculation, whence it may arise as the idea or concept of Eden" (460). This essay ques tions Readings s emphasis on the historicism of Eden because of the presence of a generalized anxiety about the description of place that reaches its apex in the description of Eden but does not neces sarily originate there. However, Readings' warnings about the difficulty of the historicism of a poem that more or less invented literary history are important to the rather ahistorical idea of Miltonic place suggested here. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="20">42 Andrew Mattison " Marshall Grossman seems to assume that the problem of imagination applies only to Heaven. Gross man comments on the difficulty of describing Heaven: "When Milton intends to relate 'things invis ible to mortal sight,' he faces a specific and language-bound problem. He conflates two visions—one temporal, empirical, mimetic; the other eternal, revelatory. These visions are double, but each is pro jected into the single linear discourse of a poetic narrative" (178). This discrepancy may be part of the problem, but the difficulty of place extends to Earth as well as to Heaven. 4 For Fish Book 8 is the clearest point in a pedagogical exercise governing the whole poem: "The point is that in Milton's universe interpretive labors of a world-constituting kind are performed by everyone, and these labors begin by constituting or conceiving God, after which everything else follows. In book VIII of Paradise Lost, Adam learns from Raphael exactly how it is done" (How Milton Works 518). Various permutations of the reading that the warning is there but does not work are pos sible; Shoaf believes that Raphael has given Adam adequate reason not to fall but that "Raphael's lesson is forgotten, unheeded [. . .]" (151). If the lesson is "forgotten," it follows that it must have been heard and made sense. In other words both of these critics regard the problems with Raphael's warning as somehow external to it, an assumption here considered undermined by Raphael's anxieties. 5 A. J. A Waldock, for example, says that Raphael's speech toward the end of Book 8 is a sign of Milton's growing uncertainty, and that in delivering God's and Milton's message "Raphael does his work rather clumsily and gives us little confidence that his props will hold" (52). Fish mentions parenthetically that Raphael is "imparting a warning he knows will go unheeded" (Surprised 192). Waldock's claim, though strong, is probably an accurate depiction of a reader who expects that Raphael has the power to prevent the Fall and is waiting for him to do it. Fish, however, simplifies Raphael's position; even if Raphael knows his warning will fail, he has every reason to think that Adam will pay attention to it, and as the reading of Book 8 below shows, Adam takes the warning seriously enough to make distinctions between those parts that make sense to him and those that do not. Adam, at least, is determined not to let Raphael's shortcomings cause him to fall. 6 Schwartz, arguing that a central concern of the poem is the proximity of chaos to creation, assumes that Raphael's uncertainty while describing creation reflects Milton's own concerns about the problem of the description itself: "To say that Milton's creation is imperilled even as he describes it is not to say enough; it is especially when Milton thematizes creation, both the divine cosmic one and his own, that the danger is most acute" (61). Schwartz stresses the relationship between God's creation and Milton's because her argument depends on the idea that Milton perceives his poem as freeing creation from chaos in a way similar to God's own function. Similar relationships between Milton's and God's respective projects occur elsewhere in the criticism as well; central to Angela Esterhammer's argument, for example, is the idea that "Raphael addresses Adam and Eve at the same time that the poet addresses the reader" (114); like Schwartz, she would assume that whatever ironies are present in Raphael's speech, they do not prevent Milton from speaking through him in deliver ing an account of creation. 7 Even from the point of view of a theodicy, Adam's ability to imagine the remote is one of his best characteristics; Dennis Danielson, for example, points out Adam's intellectual accomplishment in deducing, "from his own existence and from the wonders of creation that he beheld round about him," the necessity of God's existence (121). Raphael's discouragement of this kind of thinking has little support; Danielson approves of Adam's ambitious imagination, and God does as well. 8 Charles Eric Reeves finds a similar problem but locates it within the literary depiction of Raphael: an "apparent incompatibility of his ontological and narrative presence," caused by his rhetorical and moral dilemma resulting from the foreknowledge of the Fall (93). Reeves devotes considerable atten tion to the possibility that Raphael has heard God's prediction of human sin, but since Raphael stresses to such a degree the difficulty of Adam's understanding of any heavenly event, the incom patibility would seem to exist regardless of whether Raphael knows about the Fall. 9 Schwartz argues that angelic song solves the paradox of human knowledge: "Knowledge born of a will to dominate an objectified creation 'out there' leads to the return of chaos; knowledge which celebrates creations furthers the continual process of creation. This is why the battle between kinds of knowledge is waged in such proximity to the creation narratives; it is also why legitimate expres © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="21">Milton Quarterly 43 sions of the creation—ones that are unblamed—are framed as song of praise" (41). Schwartz is right about the unity of the relationship between chaos and creation in Milton's thought, in God's, and in Raphael's, but that unity is why "legitimate expressions of the creation" are tinged with the same anxiety about Adam's ability to imagine Heaven that we find in his attempts to imagine, as it were, secularly. If creation were in itself the solution to the problem of knowledge, then Adam would be able to participate in angelic praise, but as it turns out there is no part of Heaven that he can have access to without risk. Theodor Adorno has in mind something like this supplanting of one idea with a related but larger scale idea when he calls the Abgesang, the "B" in an AAB form, "the fulfillment of a musical context by something fundamentally new" (42). The most significant thing about AAB form for Adorno is that unlike most musical forms it is not "closed": it ends on a new idea rather than returning to an old one. A directly analogous example to "soft on the flow'ry herb" is the narrator's description of Adam waking Eve: "Her hand soft touching" (5.17). "Soft" modifies "touching" as an adverb, but also suggests a modification of "hand" (as an adjective); the line contains both Eve's beauty and Adam's gentleness. 12 Geoffrey Hartman calls the image of the sun at the center of Adam's description "startling" and "extreme" (124-25): the directness and physicality of the relationship between Adam and nature it describes seems out of place, particularly in response to Raphael's austere image of creation. 13 Fish explains the presence of seemingly posdapsarian aspects in Eden before the Fall as risk: "the 'raw material' of the Edenic character exists in potential, and can go either way [. . .]" (How Milton Works 532). This reading does not, however, explain the disconnection from landscape Adam feels (or the disconnection from Heaven Raphael enforces)—not only the potential causes of the Fall, but the actual effects of the Fall in prelapsarian Eden. 14 As William Flesch puts it, both Adam and Raphael "speak in the vocabulary of a possible scarcity" (227). For Flesch, the issue here is economics: "As in his conversation with Raphael [about astronomy], and as in his talk with Eve about the children who will soon share in all this plenty, Adam expresses a sense of proportion that is finally utilitarian. All this wealth must have some use" (228). Flesch thinks that this logic is part of a general dynamic throughout this part of the poem, but in all of these instances Adam returns to the kind of logic he believes God has approved during his request for Eve. Michael Allen makes a similar point about the distinct kinds of education Raphael and God pursue; for Allen, "Raphael is far from a perfect exponent of Milton's pedagogy" (114); Raphael has too little control and Michael is too severe, but, Allen says, only "the Father is able to attain the desired educational end while delighting his pupil" (117). 17 Hartman observes that even in their basic function, gathering food, Adam and Eve are anxious, since they have so little to do in relation to the work of the rest of the landscape; "their noble ease is perplexed by the energy of the sun and the radiance of the stars" (129). 18 Empson is certain the pun exists: "The airs attune the leaves because the air itself is as enliven ing as an air" (129). 19 Christopher Kendrick thinks of this passage the other way around: "The birds' 'choir' is made to seem born from the earth, like the smell of field and grove, while the earth itself is humanized by the metaphor of breathing" (191). His cooperative image works well, although the subject of "Breathing" is "airs" (not air): the pun suggests an even more remarkable metaphor than the one Kendrick thinks is there; not only are the birds personified, but their song is personified separately. "Vernal airs" seems to have entered the language in the gaseous meaning; the OED cites it in Pope. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005</page><page sequence="22">44 Andrew Mattison Works Cited Adorno, Theodor.
