Discovered in 1994 on a back terrace of the main pyramid at the largest pre-Chavin civic ceremonial complex in the Lurin Valley, this remarkable jointed figure is believed to have been used in the religious ceremonies carried out on the pyramid's summit. A large bottle gourd was used for the figure's body and a handle to hold the effigy was produced by wrapping the lower section of the gourd in cotton thread. The head and limbs were attached to the body by cotton string, portions of which still remain, and the arms and legs were designed to move. Reminiscent of the shadow puppets of Java and Bali, this puppetlike sacred effigy suggests a previously unsuspected form of ritual activity. The effigy was found buried face down and dressed in a woven cotton cloak. Its face and limbs were naturalistically sculpted and painted with red, yellow, black, and white colored pigments, and its elaborate coiffure was formed out of human and rodent hair. This fragile and perishable object has only survived for some three thousand years because of the aridity of the Peruvian coast and its protection from irrigation and other potentially destructive human activities. While most of the figure's attributes are human, its facial ornamentation is inspired by the features of the Aplomada falcon and the male Andean condor. The figure's prominent upper fangs are typical of the iconography of Peru's central coast during the late Initial Period, and these features are interpreted as representing the awesome and supernatural character of the effigy. The attributes of soaring birds, like the falcon and the condor were used to symbolize access to the celestial sphere, and the anthropomorphic effigy may represent a mythical ancestor of the Mina Perdida social group.
