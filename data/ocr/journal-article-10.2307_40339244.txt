Unfortunately, they will not yield to academic wisdom. They cannot be classified or counted . . . but have to be seen or felt Next to nothing can be said about these things in books [but] they can no more be omitted from the theory of the art of war than can any of the other components of war. - Carl von Clausewitz, On War KEY STROKES AND KEY STRIKES H he key strokes and strikes by which we introduce an open dossier on "war" in its visible and invisible dimensions will also, clearly, be those of the typographic "key" - of the writing of tele-polemeology codes, war machines, and in the wars la- tent in critical impasses today, as a certain mutation has begun for which the global credit collapse may be, at once, mere catalyst and symptom. War, today, involves writing, encoding, the technesis of perception, the stupefaction of citizenry, the ap- parently suicidal orders of hyper consumption and so on. This riff within the visible as well as between it and its others seems to assign a double discourse to that of "war" today - an account of the military vision and strategies of always past and future wars, and the logics by which this new, totalizing order, appears installed aestheti- cally, mnemonically, archivally. Hence two typographic dossiers, inter (in) dependent, not to say at war with one another or themselves (italics, here, will do to shade this switching of voice). In the present collection the topos of "war" plays a conceptually viral rather than descriptive role. It seems, in the twenty first century, the "global" exists simultaneously with three other realities: first, a post-global order has become too visible which is the underbelly of what now looks like a twentieth -century chap- ter of geopolitical and hyperindustrial culture; second, a retreat from the anthropic Vol. 3:1 1</page><page sequence="2">models and humanism that attended that episode before the mutations of climate change, global warming, extinction events, etc.; and third, a bizarre relation to fu- turity, in which diverse geomorphic consequences for current and past depredations appear calculable, some cataclysmic in implications. It is a recently suppressed report by the US Department of Defense on "climate change," after all, that predicts water and resource wars, some local and nuclear in nature, in tandem with a regression to more or less feudal techno-states.1 In this environment, war has morphed into strangely totalizing forms. Having moved beyond war with an enemy, with anthro- pomorphic doubles (including, however faceless, the "terrorist") one now hears in credible tones of a war against animals, or against "life" itself that has become iner- tial, driven by mediacracies and hyperfinance. Once one opens that gate, one may easily address implicit wars against disappear- ing futures (or on behalf of the unborn), autogenic wars (in America), and wars against and within the "autos," the species, or oneself All of these participate in representational histories and writing modes, all today imply wars within and between archival pro- grams in a state of mutation - epistemqlogical wars. It is the last wars, as if over the primary inscriptions that human cultures and histories have organized themselves around (the "Western," the "Chinese"), that suffuse the more literal or lethal ones. Today, the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan; the narco-wars in the global south (surging in Mexico and beyond), cannot be dissociated from the intra-psychic wars waged by media streams or the corporate wars against addressing global warming or food crises. This buckling of times, these time wars, lead us nonetheless back to Clausewitz. By admitting "moral" elements to what he hopes will be a "revolutionary theory of war," Clausewitz wants to highlight the more elusive "components" of a complex tapestry of organized violence.2 As in the epigram above, the empha- sis here is on the intangible, indeed invisible, qualities of force and power that are all the more decisive for animating the "whole mass of force" because of their imperceptibility. This complex force-arrangement that Clausewitz must simply call the "mass" remains incalculable, without categorical certainty, simply un- willing to "yield" conventional forms of scholarly "wisdom." In this sense, war is only available to writing in a way that approximates some crucial and inescap- able "nothing," a "nothing" that both resists and necessitates whatever bookish contribution we might make to understanding the "art of war." This terra incog- nita of war, this "area of intangibles," or call it after Clausewitz, this "moral," "living," or "subjective nature of war" (27), is "the precious metal, the real weapon, the finely-honed blade" (142) that eventually factors human agency into (and eventually out of) the "war machine" (223): there are "factors in the war-ma- chine itself," he continues, that "can corrupt and modify the principle of enmity as embodied in its agent, man, and all that goes to make up warfare" (223). By evoking the "modifications" of war in a subjective if not also existential way, what once may have looked like policy at a different extreme appears on the verge of turning war on itself. Time and again there is in Clausewitz a certain 2 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="3">inseparability between the "physical and psychic forces" (10) of war that renders violence unavoidable and worth having, as well as subject to outcomes that can- not be conceived in advance. Through the necessary ambivalence of war, which is as difficult to name as it is impossible to neglect, one side of the question of war offers the possibility of victory; the other side of war escapes the distinction of sides altogether, annihilating the very presence of the agent - "man" - who would otherwise prefer a stable distinction about "enmity" on behalf of this or that political will. In the interstices ofClausewitz then, a touchstone for war that exceeds the visible and invisible axis, as if it posed as an extra-social and extra-anthropic point of inter- section that would need to be posited as affecto-reactive and tele-mnemonic as well - to be subject to making or masking its representation, and to inhabiting representational programs at the microdynamic level, as we see occurs with consumption today, which bears a direct relation to local wars across the planet from the imbiber, siphoning en- ergy and cacao: ultimately, "it" will become a desemanticized and destroying marker for what, today, occurs with a "threat without enemy," without human other quite (since the enemy is the home state or state of hyperindustrialization, etc.), without even an extra-terrestrial other or attacker to rally against in Hollywood style (an alien, an asteroid), and within the settings of visibility and the programming of sen- sations as such. A double structure of "war" that, today, pacifies its non-combatants and then enrolls them as passive troops, tropes, or at least consumers. According to this same ambivalence, a certain version ofClausewitz at his most agonized and perhaps also most revealing begins to emerge (recall, On War is an incomplete and posthumously published text about which its author offers self-critique - if not self-indictment - at every other turn). There is no such thing as writing on war, we might suggest, following Clausewitz, as he wrote from his position as administrative director of the Military Academy in Berlin, between 1815-1830. Rather, we are more likely faced with episodic if not also fluid sets of allegiances, co-conspiracies, and tactics at various opera- tional levels: non-representational and intra-representational struggles, mate- rial and immaterial modalities of violence, writing as embedded within the other networked factors of force that Clausewitz - perhaps recalling Napo- leon's retreat from Russian guerrilla warfare, or forecasting the Polish insur- rection he was later sent to face - conjures forth as simply "mass[ive]." So there is an anti-humanist if not finally anti-anthropomorphic strain within Clause- witz, though it is a subterranean one. When Clausewitz is musing on the in- tangibility of war, its formation within "moral" processes, its tendency toward the reversal of political will and the scattering of something once called "man," he is at his strongest and most vulnerable. This ambivalent condition, where "enmity" is inconsistent, and power, tending toward the non-objectifiable, is dispersed and concentrated in equal if oscillating extremes, is an apposite one. As every citizen/target/suspect in the US Homeland already knows, we are Introduction / Mike Hill &amp; Tom Cohen Vol. 3:1 3</page><page sequence="4">always friend and enemy at once. And this state of ambivalence - which is also, inarguably, the current state of the state - is an apposite condition not only for Clausewitz, the penultimate war theorist, but also for twenty-first century war discourse in general. At other times in On War, for example, when he is pitching the more fa- mous definition of war as "political intercourse with the addition of other means' (emphasis original, 252), the "nothing" that always goes next to the attempt to theorize war is itself set up as an obstacle that clear-headed thinking might one day overcome. In this, at least superficially less agonized version of Clause- witz - he has learned his lessons from Hobbes - there is a feigned separation between "war" and "every other human interest" that, he says, "should ... be neutralizing one another" (emphasis added, 252). Thus, in tidier Hegelian fashion, the able-minded theorist of war "must seek out the unity into which these [the social and the martial] contradictory elements combine in real life" (252). And yet, for our purposes, the key phrase in Clausewitz's placement of politics and war on a reversible continuum is neither "politics" nor "war," but the more neglected phrase: "the addition of other means!' With this phrase in mind, the essays that follow in this special issue of The Global South begin to look again - and look today - at that other term above in the citation from Clausewitz, "real life," which we could say has become surreal in that it is both fully "otherized" in a time of absolute planetary violence, as well as completely "mediatized" by the techno-"real[ities]" that are all but collapsing past notions and worn out allegiances to global law and order. The "revolutionary" "addi- tion" of "war" to "politics," in this instance, then, takes on an almost prophetic cast in foreshadowing a time of total war and common risk that Clausewitz himself may have glimpsed but could not possibly surmise. On war this time, consider, for example, the distinctly twenty-first cen- tury security document, World at Risk (aptly acronymed WAR), which is a US Congressional report on the future s geological, bio-technical, genomic, com- municational, environmental, and indeed atmospheric, arsenals of planetary violence.3 Addressed perhaps all too appropriately to a then vacant addressee - the empty seat of the "next US President" (xi) - this text surmises the coming of certain "keystrokes" of warfare that will reveal the weakness in conceiving of conflict through only military applications and according to a logic of an- thropomorphic power. Indeed, before the absent reader of a new President can settle into office, before we can congratulate ourselves for ushering in the ful- crum of civil rights reform in the body of a mixed race, black-identified com- mander-in-chief, a cruel and bitter irony is unveiled: what is being called the biggest civil rights victory in history occurs right at the tipping point of civil society's self-imposed disintegration. 4 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="5">BORDER WARS: THE COMING FAILED STATE We cannot afford to have a narco-state as a neigbour. - General Barry McCaffrey (US) On our Southwest front, in the border cities of Juarez and Tijuana, Mexi- co's ongoing narco-wars rage on with little distinction between police, military, and armed criminal gangs. Along the Northernmost black-market corridor of an emerging global south, more people were killed in Mexico in 2008 than were killed in Iraq (where in 2009 "success" still means 142,000 troops de- ployed, $12 billion per month, about 1 million killed, 4.5 million displaced, 1-2 million Widows, and 5 million orphans4). Quite in line with the Bush National Security Doctrine of 2002, which sutures neo-liberal market fundamentalism to the new security state, narco-terrorism's dark inversion of NAFTA political will supplants transnational corporate power with an equally militarized ap- proach to waging and fighting organized crime.5 Hemispheric militarization on this order is already well enough on-line in the US, as the nation scans its own horizon for a coming "failed state" scenario. The US Army War College today reports on the "uncharted strategic territory" which pits US military forces against the coming violence of a citizenry engaged in "purposeful do- mestic resistance or insurgency [spurred on] by pervasive health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters."6 While the Pentagons Joint Forces Command prepare to engage the political catastrophes of Mexico (as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan), a potential stampede of war refugees just outside the US Southwest border threatens to combine in some unholy trinity with the consequences of Wall Street kleptocracy (more than half a million US jobs lost a month and accelerating), the next terrorist strike, and the certain arrival of Katrina s younger siblings along our own gulf front. The new contours of civil society include the legitimate use of US military force inside the nation itself to the tune of 20,000 "domestic duty" troops.7 As "global" political will is displaced by Black Swan events, and pop-up militias weaken state agency, the word revolt hardly captures the breadth of turmoil already in our midst. To be able to muster public outcry against the de-civilianization of civil society on this order - or to be silent on doing so - is a privilege attendant to drawing in the last breaths of disappearing air in our so-called first-world "American" bubble. Contrasted with relatively quiet responses to the financial crash of 2008, social turmoil of a kind only feared in the US comprises today's planetary order: Athens, China, Haiti, Riga (Latvia), Santa Cruz (Bolivia), Sofia (Bulgaria), Vilnius (Lithuania), Vladivostok (Russia), Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Senegal, we could continue, have arguably entered the analytical no-man's land of intra-state as well as stateless rebellion. Introduction / Mike Hill &amp; Tom Cohen Vol. 3:1 5</page><page sequence="6">(And this is not to mention Somali pirates, the killing fields of Bosnia, Libe- ria, Sierra Leone, or the Dafur region of Sudan.) China records so-called "mass incidents" approaching the high thousands each month, and the Mum- bai model for global guerrilla warfare echoes across the Muslim world from Gaza to the Kashmir and beyond. According to the recent World Bank's re- port, Global Economic Prospects 2009, while banks and corporation in the wealthier countries pull out from previous investments in the developing world, and while the thirst for bio-fuels and carbon-caps push food costs be- yond the reach of hundreds of millions of people, the episodes of violence seen in 2008 will extend to regime threatening capabilities throughout the devel- oping world and, indeed, are poised to spill over and become a global, better, a "post-global/' phenomenon.8 In a country like Haiti, where 80 per cent of the population lives on between one and two dollars a day, the 30-40 per cent increase in basic food staples in 2008-09 will simply amount to a tacitly sanc- tioned culling of the human population.9 The consumption of "dirt cookies" (cookies of mud with salt and shortening) is on the increase in Haiti this year - such are meal rations in the trenches of wars for food sovereignty, yet to be recognized as such. These "dirt cookies" open a further dossier with a future - the "disposable" class exposed in the U.S. during the Katrina inundation, and evident in the planetary underclass, harvested for organs and without potable water, the rehearsal of what is predicted as a global "population culling referenced to global warming and dwin- dling food supplies for a population set to plateau at 2050, by UN. calculations, at 9.5 billion, each with carbon needs. What this window opens on presents an aporia for the very premise of the "political" today, where that is conceived, as we all do, under the rubric of historical justice, identity resurgence, even the phantom raising of the underdeveloped world to "American" life-style standards promised by neo-liber- alism - what would require four planets of materiel. When Chris Hedges recently spotlighted this in an essay on Alternet, "Are we breeding ourselves to extinction?,10 there was an immediate feminist reply beating down population scare-mongering as politically harmful to women and, implicitly, racist, a distraction from current at- tempts to address global warming, and so on, as if this were still the 8O's.n If popula- tion is an issue - "if" - it will not go away because it is politically monstrous, which may be why the DoD report mentioned above speaks, casually, of "population cull- ing" (the preferred forms are not listed). This irresolvable contradiction, between twentieth-century narratives of social justice and the inclemencies of species survival, is not likely to get easier to resolve, and puts on display the complicitous blinds of progressivism before the advent of twenty-first century implosions at once cultural and speciesist (credit, biodiversity, resource). Another quiet war, but also within the "political" itself, where the premise of survival overrides, at all ends of the political spectrum, the ideals of "emancipation," closing any current future of democracy. Thus the "global" confirms itself as the planetary while bottoming-up to reveal an always 6 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="7">post-global underbelly and suicidal drift which the remarkable "Bush" era - as anomaly or as pure American logic - accelerated beyond possible reversal. As tipping points pass that are to play out in decades or more, nothing in geomorphic time, the entirely banal and non-apocalyptic specter of extinction appears before what may be called no longer a problem of polity but of species, energy transference, the endless re- inventions of what cannot quite be roped off, here and there y as capital any more. Here the anthropomorphic yields, despite itself to the violence of chemical orders (ocean acidity), mass extinction events, parabiotic and geomorphic times. In this new order of violence that exceeds human agency, or epistemographies received by mono- theistic and alphabetical legacies, at least, a profound dis-orientation occurs, resonant in the infantilization or pacification of the populace, the citizens ofthepolis (as op- posed to those without any national borders). All this is simply to update, if you like, what we already alluded to as that certain prophetic element, detectible in Clausewitz today, that says: "nothing" can be said of war outside of war because, by superseding human agency and mere political will, the dynamics of war exist ubiquitously, in the act of eating and breathing, in everything and everywhere. With the "revolutionary" addi- tion of "politics" to "war," it could be argued on one hand that Clausewitz is maintaining the rear-guard modern myth of Western style civility, the separa- tion of war and peace, or at least, the careful exportation of war outside "mo- dernity s" borders. But on the other hand, we should emphasize that in choosing the titular phrase for this cluster of essays, "War as Other Means," the concern in what follows is less about war in the circumscribable sense of opposing state forces - which in todays geopolitical climate seems almost quaint - and more with such items of war as stateless insurgencies, newly invigorated mediational capacities, emergent technicities, and bio-ethical mutations. This "other" dimension of war, at work in the most passive and oblivious global citizen today, might be called invisible except it inhabits the very orders and con- structions of (blind) visibles themselves - and operates from within the calculation of disappearing futures and reserves to aesthetics, marketing, mnemotechnics of all va- riety, including those of the favored critical idioms and definitions of the "political" that accompanied academic culture into the Bush era. The premise of the symposium from which this volume derives, titled Ecologies of War or Eco-War, posited this now horizonless domain as its point of departure - asking different idioms, critical projects, and political queries to turn toward it in their own ways (through finance, image, rhetoric, technologies, or all in some combination). The premise derived from that of the hosting entity, the intra-SUNY "Institute on Critical Climate Change" (http://www.criticalclimatechange.com/), which asks the question: if we have en- tered a non-anthropic era of "climate change," what mutations in our critical lan- guages - in programs of reference, conceptuality, or hybridity - stand to replace the twentieth- century idioms and politics that seems unprepared and systemically out- stripped, with their residual humanisms, for twenty first-century horizons in which Introduction / Mike Hill &amp; Tom Cohen Vol. 3:1 7</page><page sequence="8">tipping points, resource wars and a retreat from twentieth-century political prem- ises &gt; down to species extinction, appear on the menu? Even if we call these agencies, now, X-factors since they lay outside representational networks, without charisma or face, is it only to defer what we do not yet have proper names for, or the accelerations they purvey? In this sense, one has moved from war as a horizon of the human enemy, of the double still readable in twentieth-century wars, to something like what Hitchcock calls the ubird war," the turning of the without, in the form of animation and technics both, against the Bodega Bay of human sensorial programming, mne- monics, imaging, and consumption at once. This collection of essays both focuses on, and is designed to trouble, the "moral" or "subjective" imperatives for war that hover, like unhappy ghosts, above political will in any of its usual guises. Racial, ethnic, national, eco- nomic, and other life divisions are both intensifying and, arguably, re- or dis- orienting into some wickedly complicated promise of equality as a universal (if still uneven) exposure to this or that order of planetary violence. Perhaps the prospect of equality has become a matter not simply of living well as individu- als, if living also according to one's place in the planet's economic food chain, but of dying in a collectively unspeakable way, that is together and in common, without the luxury of designating any longer between war and peace. Clausewitz's notion of "real life," we should note, hardly ever rests on a uni- fied reciprocal action of forces with an outcome of equilibrium, whether this so-called reciprocity is supposed to exist in war as "a duel on a larger scale" (12); or analogously, in "political relations" as what Habermas dreamed about as communicative reason. Rather, as a "total phenomenon," with "next to noth- ing" that can be account for by writing, war is what Clausewitz more appropri- ately calls "a true chameleon" (31). War is acutely "paradoxical" because it is laden with as much force as politics, as much calculation as chance. It is not a rupture in the social fabric that designates the problem of war but the intensi- fication of a determinate communal substrate, an occulted pattern within the more visible patterns of sociality and conflict that exists within an "extreme diversity of factors and relationships" (134). These relationships, let us empha- size, include so-called "moral" or "subjective" relationships, but they do not surrender to individual control or necessarily to the political will of the state. War plays sinister and sometimes redeeming games of fortune with its con- stituencies at all levels. And in this sense, war both includes and supercedes whatever good conscience "academic" war writing may wish to introduce to Clausewitz s "mass offeree." On this order, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates announces a change in the "fundamental nature of conflict" that operates precisely according to what he insists is war's new dependence on "non-military instruments of power."12 Gates moves the contemporary scene of warfare from a clearer sense of conflict between members of armed nation-states to what he calls a "gray area" that 8 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="9">blurs the "friend, adversary" distinction. A historian, former University Presi- dent, and career CIA officer, he also assigns the "obligations of citizenship" a supporting if not also paradoxical role along the "blurred line between civilian and combatant" (108). The term here, highly prominent in the new epistimo- military arts behind such ventures as the "Human Terrain Systems" program, is "soft power."13 And according to "soft power," Clausewitz's interest in "morality" - what we might call instead cultrual transmission - finally comes into its own. In an "age where friends and enemies alike will seem out of focus [on the] irregular battlefield" (108), and where violence intensifies at the level of self-identification, memory and thought, would it be too much to suggest that twenty-first century war discourse has expanded on Clausewitz, intensi- fied his "psychic" drift, but also reversed him? For Clausewitz, the notion of war as policy with "the addition of other means' simply offers a way of one state to enforce its will upon another. But this is a superficial reading of him. The hardest riddle and most nagging pre- occupation in On Wary the unfinished book six, is the problem of popular in- surrection, the uses of time and environmental terrain (Mao and Che Guevara seized on this in Clausewitz directly), that is, war within and at the borders of states, and even war on what Kant, in his essay on cosmopolitan peace, half- ironically calls "the graveyard of the human race."14 The intricacies of a so- called "peoples war," which annihilates the notion of representative government based on prefiguring a "people," are especially difficult to represent in "aca- demic" terms. As Clausewitz again insists, the "turn of fortune" (189) that is implicit to the power of the weak (and who today is not weak?) is of such an uncertain capacity and illogical duration that it cannot by definition be pre- scribed in written formula. Clausewitz thus resists such a typology, in particu- lar, of intra-state or stateless conflict, because typology itself is simply another way of missing the fundamentally "incalculable" aspects of war that he links to the invisible theaters of violence. Thus the emerging "soft war" theorists, which as Secretary Gates might well insist, is a group to which every twenty-first century "cultural" thinker must more or less consciously belong, are faced with a discomfiting task, and this is where Clausewitz is both expanded and reversed. To begin thinking through his expansion, we must add to "morality," as we do in what follows, not only the imminent warification of "culture," but the arming of ecology, species mutation, communicative terror, the rank interpenetration of war and the financial markets, all as inter-related arenas of planetary violence. And to surmise our reversal of Clausewitz, we must begin by admitting not only the extension of politics to war, with the usual and necessary "academic" caveats about representational certitude, but visa-versa, the reverse extension of war back into politics, and on a scale - the discomfiting part - that renders the political project not altogether certain of itself. This is today's routine of war. Introduction / Mike Hill &amp; Tom Cohen Vol. 3:1 9</page><page sequence="10">UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS As we know, there are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns. The ones we dont know we dont know. - Donald Rumsfeld, former US secretary of Defense The only thing stranger than the poetry of Secretary Rumsfeld when he free- styled this now famous epigram at a press conference on Iraqi insurgency some years ago is the decisive influence it has had on current strategic thinking. Today we have armed the "unknown unknowns." There is real epistemology here, and the investment in "strategic shock" doctrine has made serious use of it. Consider, first, the known/unknown pairing as the philosophical analogue of the friend/enemy distinction, or more simply still, as a simple opposition between positive and negative value. We know what we know because of what we exclude, that which upsets knowledge but can also set it right. This double principle of connection and repudiation, the need for, and need to exclude, that which cannot be named but authorizes the naming, is one way of summing up the last decade and more of humanities work in mainstream(ed) cultural theory. But Rumsfeld is smarter than that. At stake in not knowing on a Rumsfeldian order is neither simply to know, nor to pose a question of simply seeking to know more or know differently. In fact, there is no question at all in what the Defense Secretary is after, no conceptual basis whatsoever for even directing an inquiry into that which is so unknown - the "unknown unknowns" - because this kind of unknown is absent even as a trace from the known/unknown ar- rangement. "Unknown unknowns" - and the emphasis must be resolutely on the plural - can therefore strike from a point of absolute alterity. A 2008 document released by the Strategic Studies Institute (SSI) at the US Army War College seeks to reorient decades worth of Department of Defense (DoD) war doctrine toward a more sustained focus on "unconven- tional, non-military, hybrid and irregular, catastrophic" events.15 As we have mentioned above, here too war-as-catastrophe is written outside the formal mechanisms of the state-manned war-machine. It includes the "homegrown domestic violence/civil disorder" (17), "toxic populism, identity politics . . . , [and] underdevelopment" (16), phenomena that subtends the "collapsed strate- gic state" (30) in a new era of impossible containment. Thus war-as-catastrophe also includes the "hybrid challenges" (30) of "epidemics, environmental disas- ters," and other Black Swan events that would "entail the rapid dissolution of public order in all or significant parts of the United States" (32). This docu- ment does not go the distance of a future that already exists, where "human 10 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="11">security" if not human population is a bearable casualty of planetary war. But it does admit that tomorrow's wars will be won and lost on "conceptual terri- tory" in a uniquely prominent way. More discomfiting still, war will exist in the "analytical no mans land separating conventional contingency events from highly incredible or speculative ones" (10). This "conceptual territory" or battlefield may reflect another order of contest - whaty too, may entail a deep shock for how the "political" has been defined, theoreti- cally and otherwise. As aputatively totalized war with a "threat without enemy" it occurs internal to the species-culture and perhaps without a "capitalism" to organize an enemy as empire (the auto-dismantling of America by Bushy ending with the im- plosion of the neo-liberal bubble itself where credit and credibility coincide). Without an enemy other explicitly \ it may find itself without even a designable "we" that is not itself fluid, open to reconfigurationy doubled against itself or its own interests. Such a twenty-first century "war" horizon suggests two things: first \ that before the horizons of climate changey that isy not of ideological hegemony but of planetary survival by humanSy the relevant war may occur within epistemographic zones, be wars over al- ternative cognitive and referential modalities; and second, that the narratives of social justice - post- colonial histories, identity politics of all varieties - appear more and more to recede in import before a more or less permanent state of so-called "crisis" in which survival becomes a new polemological motif The most curious thing about the alogos of war today is its spellbinding pacification and normativization, removed from statist and nationalist - that is, fratricidal, twentieth century - others. THE NEW WAR IMAGINARY A soldier who accepts murder as a fine art . . . accept[s] the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. - Franz Boas Let us pause over the so-called "incredible." If Defense Secretaries Rumsfeld and Gates have sketched out wars episte- mological terrain as a matter of engaging "soft power" - the contemporary ana- logue to Clausewitzs investment in the "moral" contours approximate to war (echoed, too, by the well-known American antrhopologist Franz Boas, above) - then beyond simply remapping war we must also admit the "re-rolling" not simply of political will but also of a new war imaginary. To return briefly to the SSI document above, the goal here, consistent with a doctrine predicated on "unknown unknowns," is to make the "truly incredible," the "extreme," the "ac- cidental," and the "design-less" (12-15), a routinized and defense-relevant part of the national security condition. The keyword in this process of non-military militarization is not "culture" Introduction / Mike Hill &amp; Tom Cohen Vol. 3:1 11</page><page sequence="12">this time but '"imagination." When the SSI document insists that traditional war analysis has " lacked sufficient imagination" (emphasis original, 1), the goal is to "re-roll" the "speculative" and "truly incredible." Two things are impor- tant to this re-rolling, one obvious, one not: first, the DoD is being tagged with a "failure of imagination" for being unable to forecast and defend against so many Black Swan events. But that is merely a failure on the order of a "known unknown." The way imagination ultimately figures in the SSI docu- ment is in a more substantive and complex way such that the realm of the "speculative and incredible" - our "unknown unknowns" - might be made available to war application. Think here of Hurricane Katrina as a preemptive first strike in an undeclared US civil war. The SSI document recommends a constant practice of "sophisticated horizon scanning" (2) that rests on the as- sumption that working the "imagination" itself - or failing to do so appropri- ately - is a security risk. In this sense, war mingles with banality as the so-called "human condition" (5) is recalibrated to routinize strategic surprise. In this sense, the "unconventional future" (3) of "defense relevant shock" (9) is both celebrated and feared in the SSI document. It insists that the DoD invest in the term "future" in the fullest possible sense as the very arming of time. War has thus mobilized a new chrono-politics in that the measure of duration between whatever "shock" is decreasing: the very substance of dura- tion has become part of our conceptual armament. From a different perspec- tive, Clausewitz was clear on what he called the strategic "temporalizing" of conflict, that is, "waiting," engaging in "a waiting war," as the single most effec- tive strategy in reversing a battle: the war in non-war, or in merely imagining war (177; 249), is what we tried to address by way of Clausewitz s subterranean anti-humanism. Hobbes, too, spoke about the vital (and volatile) quality of what he called "war in a tract of time," that is, the presence of war "wherein the Will to contend by Battell is sufficiently known."16 Here Hobbes focuses not only on the fiction of a shared, linear, or syncronized "tract of time" as imma- nent to peace - his goal is create a contractual condition against war, where tomorrow is the same as today - but he also introduces the existence of "Bat- tell" in our imagination of it, war's likelihood to pop-up at any otherwise pea- cable moment. In closing let us offer a more graphic and aptly contemporary example of what we might call the arming of time, this one on the order of the new war machinery, something happening right now, if you like, in real time. An extraordinary expose by Stephen Graham entitled "US Military vs. Global Southern Cities" reveals page after page of Defense Department docu- ments outlining temporal adjustments in the future of war.17 Such conflict will be born out of the ways that "global southern" cities have been targeted full- time by military satellites as potential locations of "urbaniz[ed] insurgence" (1). Through the use of unmanned aerial video surveillance, either deeply "embed- ded" within city architecture, or "loitering" in the atmosphere over potentially 12 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="13">insurgent areas, computer software is being designed to profile "normal move- ment patterns." From these patterns, one can detect anomalies in the micro- geographies of the urban populations. Such pattern recognition will be used to set aloft "fan-propelled swarms [that] disperse their nano-payloads" even before the insurgent act of violence can occur (3). In the straight talk of US war doc- trine these new capabilities enable warfare to "compress the kill chain" by a "first look, first feed, first kill" operation, as the Raytheon Corporation puts it. "Before [you] can drop your weapon and run," the R&amp;D publicity reads, "[you're] probably already dead" (4). Preemptive war technology on this order effaces the enemy even before that enemy proves itself to be one. Seeing the target is its destruction. Or not seeing - not seeing seeing itself, which has perhaps always targetted or "killed" what it clicks on from the prey animals ofLascaux ony and brings into play that other site where the generation of war occurs, in the programming of the senses themselves (as eating, as consumption, as "seeing," as touching). Hence the long theo- rized interface of cinematics and war, of war machines within the technicization of mnemonics and the visible, not to mention tele-marketing, propaganda, the infan- tilization of the current citizenry or so-called public space become the mobile screen. For one is not in an information war only, nor a corporatized espionage zone re- doubled by the hypersurveillance techniques of a new society of control - before which the democratic era seems palpably closing: one is also in a zone where "information" is its own anodyne, where the "secret" has no scandalous effect on the socius, and where the question of a redefined resistance remains open side by side with the prob- ability of political regression noted above (what the DoD report on "climate change" envisions as the emergence of feudal techno-states with limited nuclear abilities, and what in another scenario appears not "national" at all but that of a world hyperclass threatened by a newly defined global underclass - models for which are already well- evolved, with the disappearance of middle-class strata, including Germany, the U.S., etc.). According to the full-time, real-time monitoring of anomalies in urban social movements, independent groups as well as individuals are destroyed at the very moment of identification. As with GPS technology, any target on the planet can be destroyed as long as it can be seen. Kill chain compression on the tele-technical order means that war exists without "duration," and that the desire to make the Black Swan event defense relevant means coaxing war into the psychic substrate of a new war imaginary: I am always and already tar- geted and therefore only alive by a momentary luck of the draw. The point here about time becoming a security-relevant issue is that there is no longer any such option as tactical "temporalizing" in the way Clausewitz would have it, that is, along the lines of war (think here, the Cold War) as a more or less peaceable, strategic waiting game. The "real time" video is the use of images not of but as war. And as war, the image offers no duration between violence Introduction / Mike Hill &amp; Tom Cohen Vol. 3:1 13</page><page sequence="14">and representation, no empty pause between the time it takes to take a picture and the time it takes to strike. Yet here, too, lies a rift in temporalizations - what amounts, too, to time-wars, which in this case are something more than allowing the viral metonymy of "war" to totalize itself This rift is exacerbated, once again, by the shift from war as between human enemies to a logics of war attending a suicidal acceleration, in which the hu- mans valorization of itself above all entities and life-forms appears to put its premises, reserves, sanctuaries, climactic protocols at risk, together with its futures. The prospect of a slow irreversible mutation creates a counter-moment to human life as a form (among others), contracts its time-span and geographemes, highlights what Benjamin called a perpetual prehistoriality to shadow human narrative as well as the logics of auto-ex- tinction. Non-anthropic temporalities criss-cross, appear activated in accelerated feed- back loops - glacial meltoff, mass extinction events. These alter and, literally, dispossess across a new time-metrics that exceeds one generation, territorialities and resources for "life" in what is now called, geologically, the anthropocene era. This seemingly new premise, on which future resource wars are being planned, complicates immeasurably and displaces not only the model of mere fratricidal wars of ideology and enmity, empire and acquisition, but again war directed against the totality in impassive and relentless ways emanating from within the human enclave ("civilization? "the species'), the "eco,n the commodification of semantics as well as entities. This unprecedented crystal- lization, following a relatively rambunctious 5, 000 or so years ofscriptive history (and a mere century and a half of oil, hyperindustriaization, and so on), raises new questions that cannot be answered from within the critical models that accompanied us here - including the theoretical revolutions in philosophical and cultural criticism. Among else, it places the "present" in a certain time-bubble similar to the tech and real-estate bubbles of our recently deceased "free market." With tipping points passed, accelerations irreversible, the present has begun to address calculable and disappearing "futures" as it had until recently worried, and wished to rewrite, the historial archives. For Walter Benjamin, the structural event of a textual caesura that suspends temporal chains and options re-writing the past itself is paralleled by what he terms "natural history" or the contraction of non-hu- man, biomorphic time - displacing mans histories to a micro-instant within earth's lifespan when regarded as a twenty-four hour cycle parade of life forms (and not). This would suggest that the invisible wars of today that accompany the extraordinary itinerary reviewed above - since war has always been linked not only to tele-tech- nologies or the eye, techno-genocides and media, but to scientific advance and the archive as such. Key strikes. To some degree, the essays gathered for this special issue inquire into this archival war, this war within mnemonics and writing as well, from a variety of idioms and starting points. Here, now, there are no non-combat- ants just as, in a sense, there is no "collateral" damage merely. In his critique of the state's monopoly on violence, Benjamin speaks nega- tively and enigmatically against depriving the individual of the violence that 14 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="15">the rule law pretends to hide. It is worth considering today whether or not we should any longer tolerate being deprived of the dynamics of war.18 But then again, to paraphrase the famous words of Leon Trotsky, in whatever its myriad manifestations, war is interested in us whether or not we are interested in war. SOME FURY FROM THE NON-COMBATANTS War has no fury like a non-combatant. - Charles Edward Montague So are we all combatants now? It is certain that one of war's current demands is to recognize the pervasive fluidity of contemporary violence, the "chameleon" like guises of war, its visi- ble and invisible actions, which must be partly responsible for the world-wide intensification of violence in so many different forms and registers. The con- tributors collected here are not only willing to recognize such a burden but, we are convinced, they have also made important use of it. We thus begin, again, with Clausewitz, this time in the form of Jan Miesz- kowski s essay on the fleeting distinctions between rhetorical and non-rhetori- cal models of battle. In the final analysis, Mieszkowski argues, war is not politics waged otherwise; rather, politics depends on an appeal to a verbal mili- tarism that should, politically speaking, be impossible. Moving next in the di- rection of ecology, in his essay on "invasion ecology" Jason Groves introduces certain unexplored life-dimensions of bio-geographical conflict that work ac- cording to a logic of outbreak that exceeds geography per se. Extending this thread of interest in the figure of the animal, Jody Berland's essay on the animal as medium is an apt extension of Clausewitz's earlier extension, here not only from politics to war but also to a post-human or intra-species condition, with its appropriate communicative and commercial modes of exchange. Beginning from US President Barak Obama's 2009 Inaugural speech, Angela Mitropoulos examines how the coincidence of crises financial and climatic might unfold and recompose a certain oikopolitics. Henry Sussman s interest in terror in its full domesticity aptly follows Mitropouloss post- autonomist contribution to discussing the familial and the national. Sussman investigates the possibility that domesticity serves as a key breeding ground for the attitude invariably ventilated by Insults. Broadening the interest in social abjection and destitution at the communicative level, Kevin Bell explores the incommunicability of physical and psychic suffering in Claudia Rankine's 2004 multi-genre text Don t Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric, In his essay on the entanglements of cultural and financial catastrophe, Randy Martin brings political economy under the twin headings of commu- Introduction / Mike Hill &amp; Tom Cohen Vol. 3:1 15</page><page sequence="16">nicative practice and planetary risk. Martin shows here how financialization discloses the power of a derivative discourse that joins and travels through interdisciplinary worlds. And further on the issue of political economy satu- rated by war, Warren Montag details the agency of war as an essential feature of the market system in the seminal writing of the arch-free-marketeers Lud- wig Von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. The perpetuation of war on an episodic basis, from the point of view of neo-liberal theory, is both morally just and economically necessary. Robert P. Marzec bookends Mieszkowski's meditation on the discourse of war according to Clausewitz, and opens up a future oriented by certain governmental mutations in civil or "civilian" life. Here Marzec introduces the new terms, "militariality" and "metamilitarization," in order to delineate the ways in which war has become an essential technique of the US polity rather than an exceptional measure. Most of the essays collected in this special issue of The Global South were presented in short form at the November 2007 conference, "Ecologies of War," at the University at Albany, SUNY. This symposia was initiated by the Insti- tute for Critical Climate Change in the Humanities (IC3), with generous sup- port from Academic Affairs, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Center for Humanities Arts and Techno-science (Mary Valentis, director), and not least the UAlbany Department of English. A special mention is in order here of the former editor of The Global South, Al Lopez, who not only participated in the IC3 war conference, but promoted and encouraged further review of our efforts, which now exist in printed form thanks to him, and to the generosity (and patience) of the current TGS editor, Adetayo Alabi.
