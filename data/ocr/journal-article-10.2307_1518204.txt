<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vetus Testamentum XXXIV, 1 (1984) THE FIRST PERICOPE IN THE BOOK OF ISAIAH by JOHN T. WILLIS Abilene, Texas The determination of the extent of a pericope in any section of the Bible is vital to a proper analysis and understanding of the text. It is inseparably bound up with analysing the structure of the passage, determining the various elements which may belong to a certain genre or Gattung represented by that passage, reconstructing the Sitz im Leben in which an oracle or literary piece was at home or out of which it was produced, and ascertaining the theological message intended by the speaker, writer, editor, or redactor. Fre- quently, scholars differ as to where pericopes begin and end, and accordingly they disagree on these related matters. This is the case with the pericope beginning at Isa. i 2. Scholarly views vary on the extent of this pericope, ranging from i 2-3 to chapters i-iv, with several critics considering i 2-31 as a unit. The purpose of this arti- cle is (a) to re-examine critically views which have been advocated as to the extent of the first pericope in the book of Isaiah, and to de- fend the view which seems to be supported by the best evidence; (b) to analyse the genre reflected in this pericope; (c) to suggest a possi- ble Sitz im Leben for its emergence; and (d) to make a brief proposal concerning the relationship of its theological message to Isaiah's other oracles. Apparently, one problem lying behind the attempt to determine the extent of a pericope is the definition of the word "pericope" itself. This English word is a transliteration of the Greek teptLxo7:n, which meant "act of cutting around, section", and the Late Latin equivalent meant "section of a book". In some churches, it refers to a selection from the Bible appointed to be read in church or to be used as a text for a sermon. However, in scholarly usage it seems to refer to a (usually small) unit of scripture which is thought to have been what a prophet or some other speaker delivered at a specific time to a certain audience at a certain place, or to a literary unit which appears to form a complete whole because of either its poetic</page><page sequence="2">JOHN T. WILLIS form, content, consistency of speaker or audience, and the like, or a combination of these. I think that either of these is helpful when one keeps in mind the nature of the material with which he is dealing. For example, Jer. xxix 4-23 preserves a "letter" which Jeremiah wrote to Jews who had been carried into Babylonian exile with Jehoiachin in 598/597 B.C. On the other hand, Isa. i 2 ff. contains an oracle the prophet uttered orally to some audience (note "hear", "give ear", and "has spoken" in v. 2). This is not to say that the entire oracle has been preserved, or that the MT preserves the pro- phet's ipsissima verba, or that this oracle has not passed through a history of its own, or that the present Hebrew text should be allow- ed to stand as it is without emendation. Instead, the intention is to affirm that there is good reason to believe that Isa. i 2 ff. represents at least a part of an oracle Isaiah of Jerusalem delivered on some occasion, which the later editor of the complex to which chapter i originally belonged or the final editor of the book of Isaiah incor- porated into his work because of its relevance to his own generation and circumstances, and thus adapted to his own theological pur- poses. This is just as likely (if not more so) as the view that this was a literary creation from the beginning, constructed perhaps to serve as an introduction to a literary complex on the entire book of Isaiah as a summary of Isaiah's message. The Extent of the Pericope beginning with Isaiah i 2 i 1-iv 6. Recently J. D. W. Watts suggested that Isa. i-iv forms the first "pericope" in the book.' Yet he does not mean Isaiah delivered this block of material to a single audience at one and the same gathering, but that chapters i-iv compose the first literary unit in the book. Now this is questionable in the light of the new superscription in ii 1, the change of subject from chapter i to chapter ii, the inner coherence of chapters ii-iv apart from chapter i, and other considerations. i 2-ii 5. In three separate publications, P. R. Ackroyd argues that i 2-ii 5 is a coherent unit.2 Just as Mic. iv 1-3 forms an excellent "The Formation of Isaiah Ch. 1: Its Context in Chs. 1-4," Society of Biblical Literature 1978 Seminar Papers 1 (Missoula, 1978), pp. 109-19. 2 "A Note on Isaiah 2:1", ZA W75 (1963), pp. 320-1; "The Book of Isaiah", in Charles M.

The doom-hope pattern in i 2-ii 5 corresponds to the same pattern in iii 1-iv 6, and the thoughts expressed in ii 2-5 are very close to those found in i 21-23, 26, 27-31. ii 1 was written by some- one who knew that the same passage occurred in Mic. iv and Isa. ii, and wanted to affirm it was genuinely Isaianic. However, ii 2-5 is more naturally connected with iv 2-6 as the introduction and conclusion of a prophetic complex following the pattern hope (ii 2-5)-doom (ii 6-22)-doom (iii 1-15)-doom (iii 16-iv 1)-hope (iv 2-6). Thus ii 2-5 and iv 2-6 form an inclusio. Also, Ackroyd seems to have in mind a literary unit, not an oral prophetic oracle. i 2-31. An impressive number of scholars have regarded Isa. i 2-31 as a unit.3 Some view it as a single oracle which the prophet delivered orally on the same occasion (Barnes, p. 73; Ley, p. 23), while others think of it as a literary unit.4 This analysis is based on three fundamental arguments. First, these verses compose a coherent structure with a logical flow of thought. Zorell argues that this poem of thirty-six lines falls into two equal parts of eighteen lines each: in the first (vv. 2-15) the people are reproached for their sins, and in the second (vv. 16-31) they are called to repentance and threatened with destruction if they do not (Zorell, pp. 69-70). On the other hand, Mattioli finds a tripartite structure, each section beginning with the summons to "hear" (vv. 2, 10, 24). Since the hearers addressed in v. 24 are not specified, they must be identical with those addressed in vv. 2 and 10, which suggests that the whole chapter is a unit (Mattioli, pp. 350-1). Second, this chapter con- tains but a single genre, a covenant lawsuit. The lawsuit ordinarily consists of three essential parts, all of which are present in this 3 J. A.

WILLIS chapter: an appeal to witnesses (vv. 2-9), an appeal to the guilty (vv. 10-23), and the pronouncing of the sentence (vv. 24-31). Everything in this section fits into a lawsuit (Mattioli, p. 351). Third, there are several connections of words and ideas throughout this chapter. For example, vv. 2-3 describe Yahweh's vexation over his unfaithful children, and v. 21 depicts his vexation over his unfaithful wife. The text speaks ofJudah "revolting" (v. 5, Heb. swr) or "rebelling" (v. 23, Heb. srr) against the Lord. "Zion" occurs three times throughout the chapter (vv. 8, 21 [LXX], 27). Three times the pro- phet comments on what Yahweh says (vv. 8-9, 21-23, 27-31). Several other examples might be cited. While there is some validity to these observations, other factors need to be taken into consideration. First, v. 24 does not really con- tain the appeal to "Hear" as do vv. 2 and 10. In fact, a major divi- sion at v. 24 severs vv. 21-23 from vv. 24-26, thus destroying the chiastic structure of vv. 21-26. Second, it is questionable whether there is only one genre in Isa. i. 'ekdh (at the beginning of v. 21) is the normal beginning of a lament (cf. Lam. i 1, ii 1, iv 1), and the content of vv. 21 ff. reflects this genre. Third, the recurrence of words and themes does not necessarily demonstrate a single oracle delivered on the same occasion. Isaiah may have used the same words or spoken on the same subjects to different audiences on dif- ferent occasions, and his oracles may have been arranged in their present order later because they contain the same words or ideas. i 2-3 + 21-31. Recently S. Niditch has argued that Isa. i 2-31 consists of two originally independent pericopes: i 2-3 + 21-31 and i 4-20. The latter is personal; it is a sermon, following the structure of a woe oracle leading to a cultic polemic; its language is formulaic; and it follows a logical thematic development. On the other hand, the former is impersonal, and takes the form of a lawsuit.5 However, this does not really explain why vv. 2-3 were separated from their original sequel in vv. 21-31. Niditch herself admits that vv. 4-20 contain several elements which belong to the lawsuit form.6 Vv. 21-31 conform to the genre of a lament, not to that of a lawsuit. i 2-17.

Condamin, "Les Chapitres I et II du Livre d'Isaie", RB 13 (1904), pp. 10-14; Le Livre d'Isaie (Paris, 1905), pp. 1-7, divides Isa. i-ii into two pericopes: i 1-27 and i 28-ii 22, but advances no arguments in support of this. 66</page><page sequence="5">THE FIRST PERICOPE IN THE BOOK OF ISAIAH century argued that the first pericope in the book of Isaiah is i 2-17.7 They reasoned that (a) the mention of Sodom and Gomorrah in v. 10 would not be understandable without v. 9; (b) vv. 2-17 seem to date from the same period; (c) the introductory formula in v. 18 sets off vv. 18-20 from that which precedes; and (d) the form and content of vv. 18-20 are different from that of vv. 2-17. While the first two arguments appear to be valid, the last two are not convincing (see the discussion of i 2-20 below). i 2-9. A widely held view is that i 2-9 is the first pericope in the book of Isaiah.8 This is based on the following arguments. (1) "Hear" (simcu) and "give ear" (halazinu) in v. 10 point to a dif- ferent audience from that addressed in vv. 2 (or 4)-9. (2) "Sodom and Gomorrah" are used of destruction in v. 9, but of sin in v. 10. (3) The theme of vv. 2-9 is different from that of vv. 10-17 (or 20): the former has to do with God's punishment of Judah and Jerusalem because of the sins of the people, whereas the latter con- tains a reproof against those who put their trust in external ritualistic acts of religion but whose hearts and daily lives are ungodly. (4) Vv. 2-9 come from a time of national collapse, while vv. 10-20 reflect a period of prosperity when external worship was being practiced regularly by those who could afford extravagant sacrifices. These arguments will be evaluated below. i 2-4.

Over the past thirty-five years or so, many scholars have adopted the view that the first pericope in the book of Isaiah consists of i 2-3.10 Several arguments have been advanced in defence of this position. (a) The meter or rhythm of vv. 2-3 is different from that of vv. 4-9. (b) The genres of vv. 2-3 and of vv. 4-9 are different. The former is an accusation, whereas the latter is a reproach giving way to a lament. (c) The tone of vv. 2-3 is different from that of vv. 4-9. (d) Yahweh is the speaker in vv. 2-3, but the prophet speaks concerning Yahweh in vv. 3-9. (e) hoy (v. 4) always stands at the beginning of a pericope. These arguments will be evaluated in the following section. i 2-20. A detailed study of Isa. i has led the present writer to believe that the first pericope in this prophetic book is i 2-20.11 This is supported by the following considerations.

This fits well his references to Yahweh in the third person in vv. 4-9 (cf. Budde, p. 21). Second, whereas hoy often stands at the beginning of a pericope, this is not always the case. hoy occurs toward the end of a pericope in Jer. 1 27 and Zech. xi 17 and in the middle of a pericope in Jer. xlvii 6, and the closely related word 'oy, in the middle of the pericope in Jer. xlviii 46. Further, hoy is used in the middle of a pericope a second time in Isa. i (i.e., in v. 24). The chiastic struc- ture of vv. 21-26 with the repetition of words and ideas demonstrates that the pericope begun at v. 21 extends at least as far as v. 26,12 thus negating the view that a new pericope begins at v. 24. Third, vv. 2-3 lack a conclusion and vv. 4-9 lack an introduction. Vv. 2-4 contain an accusation against Israel (udah) for responding improperly (unnaturally) to God's love, then vv. 5-9 proclaim that this ingratitude is the reason for the recent calamities which have befallen the land. Fourth, several words and ideas are repeated and intertwine in vv. 2-20. "Hear" (simcu) and "give ear" (ha"zini and ha zinu respectively) occur in vv. 2 and 10. The use of the father-son rela- tionship as a figure for the relationship between God and Israel appears in vv. 2 and 4 (note bdnim in both verses, as well as the synonymous term zerac in v. 4). Four times reference is made to Israel's rebellion against Yahweh (vv. 2-ps; 4-Czb; 5-swr; 20-mrh). The typical words for sin are found throughout the chapter (kht in vv. 4, 18; Cwn in v. 4; rc in vv. 4, 16 [twice]; 'wh in v. 13). Israel is called a "people" (Cam) three times (vv. 3, 4, 10). V. 7 states that aliens "devour" the land of Israel, whereas in v. 19 Yahweh declares that if Israel is willing and obedient her people will "eat" the good of the land, and v. 20 warns that if the people rebel they shall be "devoured" by the sword. The Hebrew root used in all these passages is 'kl. tosipu occurs in vv. 5 and 13.

WILLIS to various types of injustices in v. 15, explaining the figure of washing and making clean in v. 16, and of sins being "scarlet" or "crimson" in v. 18. Yahweh is depicted in highly anthropomorphic terms throughout. He has "nourished" and "brought up" children (v. 2), he has "had enough of" animal sacrifices (v. 11), his "soul hates" the appointed feasts ofJudah, they are a "trouble" to him, he "is weary of bearing" them (v. 14), he "hides his eyes from" and refuses to "hear" those who pray to him (v. 15), his "eyes" are upon the people's evil (v. 17), and he asks his people to "reason together" with him (v. 18). Various parts of the human body are used throughout this pericope in a figurative sense refer- ring to the people and to Yahweh. The prophet compares the af- flicted condition of the people with an individual who is sick all over, including his "head", "heart", and "feet" (vv. 5-6). God denies that he requires animal sacrifices from the people's "hand" (v. 12), and declares their "hands" are full of blood (v. 15). God hides his "eyes" from those who pray (v. 15), and calls on sinners to put away their evil from before his "eyes" (v. 16). Fifth, vv. 2-4 contain a general description ofJudah's apostasy, vv. 11-17 make this description specific, and finally v. 20 returns to the general description. Sixth, the address to "rulers of Sodom" and "people of Gomor- rah" in v. 10 would not have made sense to a Judean audience at the beginning of an oracle without some prior context or background.13 V. 9 provides that background. So vv. 10 ff. are not the beginning of a new oracle delivered by Isaiah to an audience at a different time and place from that found in vv. 2-9. Perhaps the prophet's words in vv. 2-9 caused an agitated stir and hubbub among his hearers, and he used the new address in v. 10 to get the audience quiet and to regain their attention. Or possibly an angry hearer responded to or interrupted his oracle to challenge the validi- ty of its message, and vv. 10 ff. contain the prophet's response to that interruption.'4 13 Feldman, p. 11; Betteridge, p. 45; Marti, p. 9; Wade, p. 5; Duhm, pp. 23-4, 28; Budde, p. 25; E.

That Old Testament prophetic books preserve dialogues between a prophet and his hearers is well-known.

The common procedure in attempting to ascertain the structure of a "lawsuit" is to compare passages in which the lawsuit is thought to exist and to deduce the probable original structure from the elements which the various passages have in common.15 But this is precarious because of the paucity of texts at the scholar's disposal, the subjectivity of determining the extent of a pericope, and the fact that no "pure rib" exists. In other words, even if we assume that there was a rigid "lawsuit" structure in Israelite society, a prophet could have adapted and reshaped that structure to suit his own message and purposes in almost any conceivable way. He could have expanded it, shortened it, or used a portion or all of it'in the larger context of his own proclamation. It has long been recognized that vv. 2-3 and 18-20 reflect a legal suit. Since Yahweh the plaintiff at least begins his case as a father bringing charges against his own sons (vv. 2-4; cf. Deut. xxi 18-21), the genuine concern of the speaker for his hearers (vv. 2, 5-6), his expressions of compassion (vv. 7-8), his plea for his audience to change their ways (vv. 16-17), and his offer of deliverance if they repent (vv. 18-19), are under- standable. Admittedly, in a normal lawsuit a more legalistic, im- personal approach would be expected; but in the light of the per- sonal relationship of the plaintiff and the defendant assumed here, these warmer, more personal touches are in order. Eighth, the offer of forgiveness in v. 18 and the choice given the hearers in vv. 19-20 form a natural conclusion to the admonitions in vv. 16-17.16 Without vv. 18-20, vv. 10-17 do not have a good conclu- sion, and without vv. 10-17, vv. 18-20 lack a specific, meaningful context. It is also conceivable (though not absolutely necessary) that a protest from the audience was expressed between vv. 17 and 18. A hearer may have declared that even if the people's sins were manifold and rebellious, they could be forgiven by the external acts of worship in spite of Isaiah's words. In this case, the reply in vv. 18-20 would mean that they could be forgiven only by God's grace 15 E.g., the analysis of H. B.

In this case, the response in vv. 18-20 would mean that God's grace and forgiveness would empower them to do this.'8 Ninth, vv. 2-20 may well reflect the same historical setting (see below). Tenth, the statement kzyhwh dibber in v. 2a3 and kl piyhwh dibber in v. 20 are almost identical, and form an inclusio or envelope pat- tern around the material in between. The Genre of Isaiah i 2-20 Space prohibits a full discussion of the different scholarly posi- tions on the genre of Isa. i 2-20 in the present study. The most pro- minent views of the various portions of this section are these: (1) vv. 2-3 are a lament,'9 a lawsuit (Wildberger, pp. 9-16; Holladay, pp. 46-8), or an accusation; 20 (2) vv. 4-9 are a punishment oracle in the form of a lament (cf. Mowinckel, p. 77; Fohrer, Die Propheten, p. 155), a woe oracle (Scharbert, p. 287), or a reproach;21 (3) vv. 10-17 are a lawsuit,22 a lament (Penna, p. 51), or a prophetic torah;23 (4) vv. 18-20 are a lawsuit,24 a discussion in a lawsuit,25 or a threat of punishment and conditional promise (Mowinckel, p. 79). 17 So Fohrer, Jesaja 1, p. 39; Die Propheten , p. 114. 18 So H.

And, indeed, the term which appears to describe this pericope most accurately is "lawsuit". Yahweh is the plaintiff and judge (vv. 2a[3, 10, 1la[3, 18a3, 20c), the heavens and earth are witnesses of the veracity and appropriateness of Yahweh's accusations (v. 2aa), the prophet is Yahweh's spokesman or legal representative in the trial (vv. 2a, 4, 9, 10), the rulers and people of Judah are the defendants, and the (implied) defence of the accused is their present well-being (vv. 8-9) and the frequency and quantity of their ritualistic worship (vv. 11-15). All the elements in vv. 2-20 may be regarded as vital aspects of a lawsuit, if it is kept in mind that the plaintiff is a father who feels compelled to bring accusation against his own son in order to turn him back from the path of destruction he has chosen to the care and security of his father. As the pericope progresses, the father-son figure is abandoned for a straightforward presentation of the actual situation in Judah. Accordingly, vv. 2-4 are not a "lament" in the normal sense of the word, like many psalms, but an expression of the father's deep regret over his son's rebellion against him. Vv. 5-8 are not a reproach or a punishment oracle or a lament as usually understood, but a father's moving and pleading appeal to his son to turn away from his sinful course in order that the severe calamities he is presently experiencing might come to an end. V. 9 emphasizes that the only explanation forJudah's survival is Yahweh's gracious mercy. Vv. 10-15 express Yahweh's strong disapproval of his peo- ple's attempt to appease his anger by a mere external show of religion; then vv. 16-17 proclaim the ethical qualities which Yahweh demands. Finally, vv. 18-20 contain a tender plea for the people to return to Yahweh with the assurance that he will then forgive them, followed by a clear statement of the alternative consequences of returning or rebelling. This analysis suggests the possibility that a "lawsuit" may con- tain the following elements. A summons to the heavens and earth - v. 2a The regret of the plaintiff over the behavior of the defendant - vv. 2b-4 The moving plea of the plaintiff that the defendant abandon such behavior, which is responsible for the present distressful condi- tions- vv. 5-8 73</page><page sequence="12">JOHN T. WILLIS The observation that the only reason for the survival of the defen- dant is the mercy of the plaintiff - v. 9 The plaintiff's disapproval of the defendant's insincere show of repentance - vv. 10-15 The plaintiff's proclamation of conditions for the defendant's genuine repentance - vv. 16-17 The plea for the defendant's return with a promise of subsequent forgiveness and declaration of alternative consequences of returning or rebelling - vv. 18-20. This is not to affirm that all these elements are present in every lawsuit, or that they are all absolutely necessary to the lawsuit genre, but that in the right circumstances it is possible for them to be part of the lawsuit. The Sitz im Leben of Isaiah i 2-20 There has been a great deal of discussion concerning the "for- mal" Sitz im Leben of the "lawsuit", that is, the situation in the life of the people in which it was at home. Three major views have been defended: (1) it belongs to the sphere of international law and is to be connected with the Hittite suzerainty treaties; 26 (2) it is at home in the cult;27 and (3) it is based on the court case at the gate of the city (Gemser, p. 122; Huffmon, p. 293). The third seems most like- ly to the present writer, although Nielsen has a good point when she suggests that the rzb-pattern was an ancient Israelite frame of mind which could be expressed in any of the ways mentioned here. In other words, the forensic way of thinking was the Hebrew way of resolving a disagreement.28 Helpful as this concern may be, it is more important for a proper understanding of Isa. i 2-20 to attempt to determine the "actual" Sitz im Leben of this oracle, that is, the historical setting or kind of historical setting in which it was originally delivered and the mind- frame of the people for whom it was intended. Scholarly opinion is 26 J. Harvey, "Le 'Rib-Pattern', requisitoire prophetique sur la Rupture de l'Alliance", Bibl 43 (1962), pp. 172-96; J.

Some critics connect this pericope (or por- tions of it) with the Syro-Ephraimite crisis in 735-732 B.C.29 The following arguments are advanced in support of this date. First, the tone and teaching of chapter i closely resemble Isaiah's early oracles in chapters ii-v. Second, the "aliens" (zdrim) mentioned in v. 7 could well be the Edomite, Philistine, and Syrian invaders allied with the Israelites in the Syro-Ephraimite crisis (cf. 2 Chron. xxviii 5, 17-18). Third, Isa. i appears at the beginning of the book. Fourth, the severe denunciations of this pericope fit the degenerate time of Ahaz much better than the reformation period of Hezekiah. Fifth, the abundance and frequency of sacrifice and ritualistic wor- ship assumed in vv. 11-15 suggests a time of peace and great pros- perity, which would have existed in Judah just before the Syro- Ephraimite invasion but not during the period of Sennacherib's in- vasion in 701 B.C. Sixth, v. 8 does not state that Jerusalem was under siege at the time this oracle was delivered, but only that it was "like a besieged city". However, the weight of evidence seems to favor the view that this oracle was originally delivered in connection with Sennacherib's in- vasion of Jerusalem in 701 B.C.30 This is supported by the follow- ing arguments. (1) The devastation described in vv. 5-8 is much more extensive than that resulting from the Syro-Ephraimite war, 29 Dillmann, p. 3; Skinner, p. 3; Ruffenach, p. 148; Fischer, pp. 27, 29; and Ziegler, p. 11, assign vv. 2-31 to 735-732 B.C.; Condamin, RB, pp. 17-19, vv. 2-27; Kissane, pp. 4, 9, vv. 2-20; Whitehouse, p. 89; Feldmann, p. 24, vv. 2-17; Robertson, pp. 232-4, vv. 2-7, 10-15, 18-20; Steinmann, pp. 107-8, 108, n. *, 74-5, n. *, vv. 4-20; Auvray et Steinmann, p. 22, vv. 4-9; Vaccari, p. 22, vv. 7-9; Procksch, pp. 37, 44; Bright, p. 490; Moriarty, p. 267, vv. 10-20; Scott, p. 171; Wildberger, p. 37.

WILLIS and fits Sennacherib's own statements concerning his invasion of Judah in 701 B.C. (see ANET, p. 288; DOTT, p. 67). (2) The aliens (zdrim) of v. 7 could well be Assyrians, but hardly North Israelites, even if accompanied by Syrians. Neither North Israelites norJudeans are ever called zdrimr in the Old Testament. (3) Ancient peoples, including the Israelites andJudeans, increased their exter- nal ritualistic practices in times of national or personal crisis in the hope of appeasing the deity and persuading him to intervene in their behalf in order to deliver them from their affliction (see e.g., Isa. xxii 12-13; Mic. vi 6-8; Jer. xxxiv 8-22; Ps. lxxviii 34-37). Thus an intensification of ritualistic activity does not necessarily point to a time of peace and great prosperity. (4) The text and precise meaning of Isa. i 8c is widely debated. But even if one emends the text to kecir nesordh, as possibly suggested by the LXX and as adopted by many scholars,31 this is not necessarily an argu- ment against dating this oracle in 701 B.C. Rather, it may reflect a time when Jerusalem was not actually under siege, but was cut off from the rest of the Jewish people by garrisons of enemy soldiers stationed at strategic places throughout the country. In any case, the statement in v. 8c fits the events which occurred in connection with Sennacherib's invasion in 701 B.C. There seem to be clues in the Bible which may shed light on the "actual" Sitz im Leben of this pericope more specially. Scholars have assigned it variously to the time just before, during, and just after Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem.32 In one sense, all these sugges- tions may point in the right direction. Isa. xxii 1-14 may indicate that Sennacherib lifted his initial siege of Jerusalem temporarily.33 This led the people to rejoice and offer abundant sacrifices because the immediate threat to their survival was removed (vv. 1-2, 13). This temporary withdrawal of Assyria's troops may have been 31 So e.g., Dillmann, pp. 8-9; Feldmann, p. 10; Bentzen, p. 6; Penna, p. 50; Donner, p. 120. 32 Of the scholars mentioned in n. 31, Feldmann and Fohrer date it before the siege; Bentzen, Kaiser, Claassen, and Frey during the siege; and Ley, Mowinckel, Eichrodt, Donner, Wildberger, and Clements after the siege. 33 Over a hundred years later, during Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem, the Babylonians withdrew from the city for a brief period to fight the Egyptians under Pharaoh-hopra who were advancing from the south. During this time the Judeans, who had released their slaves as a sign of repentance in the hope of persuading Yahweh to deliver them from their enemies, re-enslaved them (er. xxxvii 6-11, xxxiv 8-22). A short time later, the Egyptians returned to their homeland and the Babylonian resumed the siege of Jerusalem and captured it (Jer. xxxix 2-10). 76</page><page sequence="15">THE FIRST PERICOPE IN THE BOOK OF ISAIAH occasioned by the approach of Ethiopians and Egyptians from the south (2 Kings xix 8-9; Isa. xxxvii 8-9a). A short time later, in an attempt to bluff Hezekiah and Jerusalem into surrender, Sen- nacherib sent a detachment of soldiers to Jerusalem with a threaten- ing letter demanding that they submit immediately or suffer the consequences (2 Kings xix 9b-13; Isa. xxxvii 9b-13). It is con- ceivable that, throughout the period when the siege was lifted but the Assyrians were still in the land and constantly loomed as a potential threat to return to the capital and resume the siege, the Judeans frequented the temple to engage in numerous ritualistic acts in order to persuade Yahweh to protect them from danger and to deliver them in case of renewed Assyrian attack, and that on one of these occasions Isaiah delivered the oracle now preserved in i 2-20. If so, xxii 1-14 and i 2-20 are closely related. The former was proclaimed shortly after the siege was lifted, and the latter a short time later, but before the siege was resumed. Isaiah i 2-20 and Isaiah's Theology It is a commonplace among scholars to refer to Isa. i 2-31 as a "programmatic introduction", "poetic concentrate", or "sum- marizing overview" of Isaiah's message.34 This may be an overstatement. For example, vv. 11-15 contain a polemic against mere external ritualistic acts, but one would be hard pressed to find a similar emphasis elsewhere in the oracles of Isaiah (perhaps the most likely passages are xxii 12-14 and xxix 13-14). But, even if we assume for the moment that this is the case, the general scholarly view that this is to be explained by supposing a later redactor arranged Isaianic and non-Isaianic oracles to create this sort of introduction is not the only viable option. If the conclusions reach- ed in the present article are correct, it may be that vv. 2-20 appear to be a summary of the prophet's message because he delivered this oracle near the end of his long career, when the various major emphases of his earlier oracles were paramount in his mind and seemed to be appropriate to the new situation with which the people were faced, a situation strikingly similar to several former ones experienced during his lifetime. 34 Fohrer is usually credited with this insight as a result of his article in the ZA W, pp. 251-68. However, it goes back at least to Whitehouse, p. 89; and G. A. Smith, p. 4; if not earlier. 77</page></plain_text>
