The dust jacket of Fracture and Fragmentation in British Romantidsm ends with an unexplained but tantalizing claim: "Regier 's discussion of fragmentation exposes a philosophical problem that lies behind the definition of Romanticism." Having read the book, one might want to reconfigure the statement into something like "Regier's discussion of fragmentation exposes disruptive Romanticism that problematizes the methods of philosophy." The very concepts of fracture and fragmentation, Regier contends, are "central to Romanticism," and, in turn, "it is Romanticism that teaches us how to think about, and investigate critically, many of the central pillars and assumptions of our conceptual frameworks" (3, 2). The idea of Romanticism developed in this book is not the familiar historical period of literary production, though it is certainly associated with "the time between the mid-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries" (10). Neither is Romanticism an ideological or aesthetic sensibility of the sort that was once counterpointed against the Enlightenment or Neo-Classicism. Rather, for Regier, Romanticism becomes a quasi-theoretical position whose influences are most evident in the concentration on fracture and fragmentation, and whose signature idea - sometimes enacted in literary works and sometimes elaborated in theoretical tracts - is that fragmentation is inherent and inescapable in any "linguistic, conceptual, grammatical, or philosophical structures" (13). While Regier disavows the suggestion that the book is a deconstructive study (at least in the precise Derridean sense of the term), his "overarching argument is that Romanticism is pardy defined through its broken origins" (13). Deconstruction or not, this is an impressive study, often thought- provoking and occasionally just provoking. Regier is writing into a critical-historical context that might be summarized as follows. Not too long ago, following the lead of books like M. H. Abrams's Natura I Supernaturalism or David Perkins's The Quest for 'Permanence , it was held that the visionary company of canonical Romantic poets were engaged in a poetic project that enabled them to glimpse some ultimate unity beyond the increasingly complex chaos of modernity. Certainly, fragmentation is an element of this visionary poetics - Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" is the paradigmatic example - but the very existence of the poetic fragment implies some overarching whole of which the fragment is a part and toward which the poetic</page><page sequence="2">172 Book Reviews Imagination aspires. This critical perspective changed (dramatically when more historicist approaches came into prominence (think of Jerome McGann's Romantic Ideology or Marjorie Levinson's Wordsworth's Great Period Poems). The basic argument was that the then-dominant criticism was essentially a mystified continuation of the Romantic ideology - a veneration of Romantic "genius" rather than genuine critique. Because more than 150 years have passed since the era of the Romantics, the argument ran, the time was right for a properly critical and historical perspective on the Romantic Imagination and its purported aspirations toward some transcendent symbol, some unity beyond fragmentation. According to this critical line, the very idea of an unfragmented, organically unified linguistic structure was a kind of compensatory myth or necessary fiction - it said more about the projections and desires of poets and readers than about any transhistorical "truth." Regier's study takes a somewhat different approach in that it does not focus on the fragment as a Romantic genre. Instead, adopting a disconcerting intentionality to his own discourse, Regier contends that "this book wants to shift the focus from the question of 'the fragment' as genre to 'fracture' or 'fragmentation'" (25). Conceived more as processes than embodied forms, these concepts reveal a Romanticism that is "much more meta-critical and doubtful about itself than is often assumed" (19). As such, Regier's reading develops a critical concept of Romanticism that does not require the historical perspective of the previous wave of critics. Such a perspective would in fact be misleading because, as Regier puts it, "we are still within Romanticism" (9). The book as a whole is divided loosely into two large sections. The first is more theoretical in orientation, with readings of The Ruined Cottage examined in the broader context of a rupture in language symbolized most profoundly by the Tower of Babel, of the figure of anthropomorphism in the many essays on the origin of language published in the late eighteenth century, and of the discursive aftershocks of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. The second section focuses more on the influence of an aesthetics of fracture and fragmentation as it appears in the work of Wordsworth (his use of parenthesis in The Prelude ), Keats (the letters rather than the poems), De Quincey (on the fracturing function of citation and quotation), and de Man ("Fracture becomes a fundamental marker which underlies de Man's entire theoretical position" [166]). Regier's inclusion of de Man's work along with his more typically "literary" predecessors is indicative,</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review 1 73 by the way, of the current rather than merely historical relevance of Regier's Romanticism. These chapters offer surprisingly varied approaches and thus resist the homogenizing impulse of overarching summary; nonetheless, a brief sketch of an exemplary chapter may offer a useful sense of the book's method without being overly reductive. The Lisbon earthquake was, of course, utterly catastrophic, and Regier's chapter includes several quotations from eyewitness accounts which strive to describe the destruction, but which then claim that they simply cannot capture the horrors - this unpredicted and inexplicable rupture of a major node of European civilization and even of the earth itself is excessive, beyond the grasp of language. The accounts suggest that, as Regier writes, "it is impossible to find a vocabulary for such an event: geographical, temporal, and mental classifications no longer hold" (81). The inadequacy of language in the face of such catastrophic fragmentation becomes a repeated trope in the first-hand accounts, and the reverberations work their way through European consciousness, Regier suggests, in the familiar Romantic trope of meditations on ruins and in the development - especially in Burke and Kant - of the "taming category" of the sublime (84). Through its distance (both geographical and temporal) from Lisbon, the sublime strives to aestheticize the inexplicable destruction, but the effort is not finally successful: "the fragmenting moment exceeds the possible taxonomies of a discourse of aesthetics, including the sublime" (86). The beginning of the chapter describes the dominant interpretation of the Lisbon catastrophe as fitting into a "progressivist narrative," the notion that the late eighteenth century saw the rise of a secular understanding of natural phenomena that is in turn the foundation of scientific geology in particular and science itself in general (76). The progressivist narrative, which Regier develops with reference to Kant's essay on Lisbon as then "mythologised" by Walter Benjamin, must inevitably be shaken by the unspeakable and inexplicable rupture - fracture and fragmentation - that is its ineluctable precursor (93). In Regier's language, "the secular sublime, together with its ruins, discloses a disruptive and breaking quality at its core" (94). The Lisbon chapter offers one instance of the "philosophical problem" mentioned in the dust jacket notes. The discourses of Romanticism - the sublime, for example - are founded upon, and are readable as compensations for, some moment of fragmentation wherein</page><page sequence="4">174 Book Reviews the dominant modes of understanding, perhaps including even science itself, are shown to be inadequate. The recognition of this pervasive epistemological gap is the enduring essence of Romanticism - it is evident in the Romantic texts Regier discusses, and it is evident in Regier's monitory suggestion that, while Romanticists may be prone to theoretically comprehensive claims, "it is advisable not to overestimate our results" (186).
