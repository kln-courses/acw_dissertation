There are other books that deal with evolution at this level, but most don't explain the theory of evolution in this detail while still using language that can be under- stood by upper elementary and middle school students. This book explains Darwin's theory in detail, citing recent research and discov- eries that add information about the theory of evolution. The author takes the time to break down the different ideas that Darwin used to explain the process of evolution, discussing how small changes occur over long periods of time and how these changes have brought about the huge diversity of living things on Earth. The writing is engaging and will keep the interest of students in this age group. The graphics and illustrations support the writing and help students better un- derstand the process of evolution. Some concerns that can be trou- blesome to teachers when discussing evolution with students are covered by the author. This author goes a step further by answering many common questions people have about evolu- tion. The questions are answered concisely, yet in a way that effectively communicates the information from an evolutional view. There are, however, some areas that teachers should clarify or pres- ent with caution. A few illustrations have some anthropomorphism that teachers may want to point out to students, explaining that these are just an illustrator's decision rather than scientific information. This book could be used in differ- ent ways and is an excellent resource for both students and teachers. It is formatted in such a way that allows teachers to read certain sections aloud. Students or groups could present various sections to the class. Questions and answers could also be read as separate pieces. This book complies with the ideas set forth about evolution by the National Sci- ence Education Standards and fills a gap in books about evolution for this age group. Carla Billups</page></plain_text>
