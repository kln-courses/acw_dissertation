<plain_text><page sequence="1">INSTITUTE NOTES The Annual General Meeting of the Institute will be held at the Royal Society of Arts, 18 John Street, Adelphi, London, W.C.2, on Monday, July 16th, at 5.30 p.m. The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Balfour, K.G., O.M., F.R.S., will preside and deliver a short address. Tea will be served from 4.45 to 5.15 p.m. The Session which ended on June 27th may be regarded as having been an unqualified success. The Institute has been honoured by a most dis? tinguished company of lecturers. Professor Alexander has lectured to us on "Value," Mr. Bertrand Russell on "The Philosophy of Physics," Professor Laski on "Economics in Relation to Ethics," Dr. Ginsberg and Dr. William Brown on "Psychology," Professor Lloyd Morgan on "Mind in Nature," Professor Leonard Russell on "The Approach to Philosophy," and Professor Clement Webb on "The Philosophy of Religion." At our Evening Meetings members have had the privilege of hearing discourses by Professor Nunn on "Anthropomorphism in Science," Dr. Broad on "Main Problems of Ethics," Professor Laird on "The Possibility of Rationalism in Ethics," Dr. Delisle Burns on "Ethics in Industry," and Drs. J. Rickman, H. G. Baynes, H. Crichton Miller, and Mr. Kenneth Richmond on "The New Psychology." BROADCAST TALKS ON PHILOSOPHY The British Broadcasting Corporation has decided to lend its valuable services in the interests of Adult Education. Its "talks" in the future will be designed to introduce listeners to the wide field of human knowledge in its manifold aspects. We understand that some of these talks will be on philosophical subjects, and the Institute desires to co-operate with the B.B.C. in making this part of its wrork as fruitful as possible. From time to time we shall therefore acquaint our members with the philosophical pro? gramme arranged by the B.B.C. The next talks on a philosophical subject will be by Dr. H. J. W. Hethering- ton on "The Meaning of Good." The aim of this course is to give an intro- ductory discussion of the opinions which men have entertained (and still entertain) as to the things that are best worth living for. "Thoughtful men have always distinguished between various kinds of goods, and have regarded some as more important than others. Sometimes, indeed, men have believed that they knew and could define the aim which is best worth while of all?the 'supreme' good, the good to w^iich every other is subordinate. And they have sought to justify and defend their views by considerations and arguments of very various kinds. " The first talk will set the question, and consider the views of those who say that no answer is possible. The second will inquire into the meaning of the fact (or the apparent fact) that men feel themselves under an obligation to pursue what they discern to be 'good/ The third will consider the source DD 405</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES of our knowledge of the good, and especially the notion of 'conscience.' The fourth and fifth will deal with some common formulations of the good? happiness, perfection, social service. The last talk will put the various answers together and see if any reasonably satisfactory conclusion can be reached." The talks will be on Wednesdays from 7.25 to 7.45 p.m. as follows:? June 27.?The Question: Is an Answer Possible? July 4.?Good and Obligation. July 11.?Conscience. July 18.?Happiness. July 25.?Personal and Social Good. August 1.?Reflections. It is hoped that the "talks" will awaken an interest in philosophy in many to whom hitherto it has been merely a name. Should this happen, the Institute might then consider the possibility of arranging courses of lectures as "follow-ups" to the "talks," thus affording an opportunity to those who wished it for more intensive and systematic study. VISIT OF PROFESSOR DEWEY Recently Professor Dewey, the distinguished American Philosopher and Psychologist, has honoured London with a short visit on his way to the Continent. We are very glad to hear that the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Institute, Sir Lynden Macassey, managed at short notice to arrange a small luncheon party at the Carlton Club on June 8th to welcome this eminent guest. STUDENT-MEMBERS "AT HOME" The Student-members of the Session which has just closed held an "At Home" on Tuesday, June 12th, from 8 to 10 p.m., at University College, Gower Street. The object of the "At Home" was to enable students to know each other more intimately, and to discuss questions and problems which had interested them in the various courses of lectures given during the Session. The Director of Studies and some of the lecturers were present, and this gave the students an opportunity of discussing their needs with them, and expressing their views as to how far the activities of the Institute had helped them in their studies. All those who were able to attend seemed to think that occasional "At Homes" of this kind would be both enjoyable and likely to prove valuable in helping forward the objects of the Institute. An unanimous desire was expressed that similar meetings should be arranged in the future. 406</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PSYCHOLOGY The Ninth International Congress of Psychology will be held at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A., probably in August or September 1929. The officers of the Congress are as follows: President, J. McKeen Cattell of New York; Vice-President, James R. Angell of Yale University; Secretary, Edwin G. Boring of Harvard University; Treasurer, R. S. Woodworth of Columbia University; Foreign Secretary, Herbert S. Langfeld of Princeton University; Executive Secretary, Walter S. Hunter of Clark University; Chairman of the Programme Committee, Raymond Dodge of Yale University; Chairman of the Committee on Arrangements, R. P. Angier of Yale University. Besides these men, the National Committee includes: J. E. Anderson, University of Minnesota; Madison Bentley, University of Illinois; E. A. Bott, University of Toronto; H. A. Carr, University of Chicago; Knight Dunlap, Johns Hopkins University; S. W. Fernberger, University of Pennsylvania; William McDougall, Duke University; W. B. Pillsbury, University of Michigan; C. E. Seashore, University of Iowa; L. M. Torman, Stanford University; E. L. Thorndike, Columbia University; H. C. Warren, Princeton University; M. F. Washburn, Vassar College; R. M. Yerkes, Yale University. This is the first meeting of the Congress in America. The previous meetings have been as follows: Paris, 1889; London, 1892; Munich, 1896; Paris, 1900; Rome, 1905; Geneva, 1909; Oxford, 1923; Groningen, 1926. It is expected that the Congress in the United States will be truly international in character. The Americans hope that the appointment of some foreigners for lecturers and lectureships can be arranged near the time of the Congress, so that foreign attendance can be increased and international solidarity within psychology furthered still more. Most appointments of this kind at American Universities would have to apply only to psychologists who speak English. ANNUAL JOINT SESSION OF THE ARISTOTELIAN SOCIETY AND MIND ASSOCIATION The Annual Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society and Mind Associa? tion will be held at Bristol, July 13th to 16th. The meetings will be held and accommodation provided at Clifton Hill House, the Hall of Residence for Women Students in the University of Bristol. The fee for membership, including the volume of papers, will be 10s., and the inclusive charge for accommodation will be 35s. Application for membership should be sent, with remittance, to Professor G. C. Field, The University, Bristol, from whom further particulars may be obtained. 407</page><page sequence="4">THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES (Incorporated under the Companies Acts 1908-1917 as a Company not for Profit but limited by Guarantee.)
