<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS IN PHILO, PSEUDO-PHILO'S BIBLICAL ANTIQUITIES, AND RABBINIC MIDRASHIM BY Louis H. FELDMAN Josephus (Antiquities 1.5) tells us that he has directed his work to all the Greeks, who, he thinks, will find it worthy of zealous attention. In examining his account of the history of the Biblical period, one can perceive the changes, sometimes obvious, sometimes more subtle, that he has made so as to present a greater appeal to this Greek audience. These modifications are particularly manifest when Josephus' version is compared with those of Philo, Pseudo-Philo's BiblicalAntiquities, and rabbinic midrashim. The pericope in which Josephus describes Noah and the flood is an excellent example of Josephus' goals and methods, es- pecially since this is an episode that has its counterpart in the pagan Babylonian, Greek, and Roman traditions. Thus far there have been only two studies of any note concerning this passage. The first, by Lewis,' is a mere summary of Josephus, which concludes, quite erroneously, as we shall see, that Jose- phus' treatment is a mere paraphrase of the Septuagint. It alludes only once to a pagan parallel and only twice to rabbinic 1 Jack P. Lewis, A Study of the Interpretation of Noah and the Flood in Jewish and Christian Literature (Leiden, 1978), pp. 77-81. Lewis had been preceded by Salomo Rappaport, Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus (Wien, 1930), who notes many rabbinic parallels for Josephus' additions and modifications; but Rappaport is far from complete and suffers from the attempt to force parallels where there are none. He, moreover, fails to consider that many of the modifications of Josephus, as well as Josephus' decision whether or not to include rabbinic midrashim at any given point, may be due to a conscious appeal to his audience of Greek-speaking Jews and non-Jews.</page><page sequence="2">parallels, and attempts no specific comparison with Philo or with Pseudo-Philo. Franxman2 has a more detailed paraphrase of Josephus and concludes3 that in this segment Josephus has struck a more or less even balance between version and original; but he has missed several points where Josephus significantly diverges from the Bible (whether Hebrew or Greek), and he alludes to no pagan parallels, to only three rabbinic parallels, to one parallel in Philo, and to none at all in Pseudo-Philo. The first thing, though unnoticed by previous commentators, to strike us about the Noah narrative is that it is much less concentrated than it is in the Bible. In Genesis, after Noah is first mentioned (5.29) as the son of Lamech, the narrative continues with the account of man's wickedness and G-d's decision to wipe out the human race and his directions to Noah to build an ark (chapter 6), the description of the Flood (chapter 7), the subsiding of the waters and Noah's sacrifice to G-d (chapter 8), G-d's commandments to Noah, the covenant of the rainbow, and Noah's drunkenness and nakedness (chapter 9), and the genealogy of Noah's sons (chapter 10). The net effect of this is to highlight the character of Noah. In Josephus the centrality of Noah is very much diminished, inasmuch as after he is first mentioned (Ant. 1.74) and we are told of the wicked- ness of mankind (1.75) and of G-d's instructions to Noah to build an ark (1.76-78), there is a long digression concerning the date of the Flood (1.80-88), followed by an account of the Flood itself and of the abating of the waters (1.89-92), which, in turn, is followed by another digression, noting non-Jewish witnesses to the authenticity of the Flood (1.93-95), after which comes an account of Noah's sacrifice to G-d and of G-d's covenant (1.91-103), followed by still another digression, explaining the longevity of the patriarchs (1. 104-108), followed by the account of the refusal of Noah's grandsons and later 2 Thomas W.

Hence, whereas Noah's drunkenness is in the Bible mentioned only four chapters (and only 90 verses) after the first reference to Noah, in Josephus this incident is mentioned some 65 paragraphs later, even though the account of the Flood itself is considerably condensed. In each case of digression in Josephus, it will be noted, the chief factor is apologetic, namely to explain the apparent discrepancy in the chronology of this period (1. 80-88), the apparent objection to the historicity of the whole narrative (1.93-95), the apparent objection to the Bible's state- ments about the long lives of the patriarchs (1.104-108), and the fact that the Greeks and the other nations, which claim such antiquity, are actually descended from the Biblical Noah (1.122-1 39).4 Connected with this factor of apologetics may be the desire not to build up Noah too much, inasmuch as he is the direct ancestor of what the Talmud (Sanhedrin 56aff.) refers to as the "Sons of Noah," that is, all Gentiles. We may note that in Pseudo-Philo also, while there are not as many digressions as in Josephus, from the first mention of Noah until the statement of his death there are three chapters (3.4-5.8, that is, 33 subsec- tions), much of which is taken up with an extra-Biblical list of the names of the descendants of Noah and an extra-Biblical census of their numbers (4.2-5.8); his motive also, presumably, is apologetic, namely, to diminish on the one hand, the relative importance of Noah himself, while, on the other hand, endeav- 4 Shaye J.D. Cohen, Josephus in Galilee and Rome: His Vita and Develop- ment as a Historian (Leiden, 1979), p. 32, notes that Josephus (Ant. 1.17) promises to narrate everything in proper order (cKara Tfv oiKsiav Tgtv) and that he felt free to set in order (z/&amp;ai) the Biblical material thematically, since Moses left what he wrote in a scattered condition (atop6lirv), "just as he received each several instruction from G-d." This is true, but what must be added is that the rearrangement is motivated not merely by stylistic but also, more particularly, by apologetic considerations.</page><page sequence="4">34 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [4] oring to show that the nations of the world are actually derived from Noah. That Josephus' account is motivated, above all, by apologetic concerns may be deduced especially from the fact that his readers would, in this episode, be expected to equate Noah with Deucalion of the Greek flood, as, indeed, we find that Philo (De Praemiis 4.23) does.5 It is true that Josephus makes no such equation, presumably because he wished to keep the Penta- teuch's words concerning G-d "pure of that unseemly myth- ology (a&amp;oXilgovoS; gu0oooyiag, Ant. 1.15) current among others"; but the parallel would certainly be recognized by his readers, especially in view of Josephus' terminology, as we shall see. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that Josephus was thinking of such a parallel from the fact that he (Ant. 1.73) goes out of his way to note a resemblance between the angels (&amp;yyeXoi) of G-d (Genesis 6.2), who consorted with women and begot sons who were overbearing and disdainful of every virtue, and the giants, who, according to the Greeks, did audacious exploits. That others had made the equation of Noah with Deucalion seems clear from the statement of the Church Father Theophilus (Ad Autolycum 2.19) in the second century, noting that both called mankind to repentance. Theophilus also, we may note, inveighs (Ad Autolycum 3.29) against those who had said that Noah's Flood was as local as Deucalion's.6 Indeed, 5 Fran6s H. Colson, Philo, 8 (Loeb Classical Library, Cambridge, Mass., 1939), 451-452, says that this is the only instance where Philo makes an explicit equation between a Biblical personage and a character in Greek mythology. That others, however, had made such equations is clear from such a passage as De Confusione Linguarum 2.2-5, where he notes the identification made by impious (6sUacepeTi) scoffers in their godlessness (0e60 Toq;) of the story of the Tower of Babel with the account of the attempt of the giants to pile Mount Pelion on Ossa on Olympus in order to reach heaven. 6 Similarly, Lactantius (De Origine Erroris [Patrologia Latina 6.326-327]) reproaches the heathen for claiming that Noah was merely another name for Liber (i.e. Dionysus, the god of wine), presumably because of the incident of his planting a vineyard and his becoming drunk (Gen. 9.20-21).</page><page sequence="5">[5] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALT .T S 35 Celsus (ap. Origen, Contra Celsum 1.19, 4.11, 4.42) bitterly attacks Jewish writers who alter the Deucalion story. Finally, we may also suggest that Josephus was acquainted with the story of the Ogygian Flood (mentioned by Varro, ap. Augustine, De Civitate D-i 21.8 and Nonnos 3.204ff.), since Josephus (Ant. 1.186), in a curious departure from both the Hebrew text and the Septuagint (Gen. 13.18, which mentions the "oaks of Mamre"), speaks of Abraham as living near an oak called Ogyges.7 The very first problem that confronts the reader of the Biblical narrative of the Flood is to explain why G-d, Who is perfect and presumably unchanging, should have changed His mind and repented (Gen. 6.6) that He had created man. We may remark that the oldest manuscripts of the Septuagint have "was angry" ( wve)uifrl, , "took to heart," "was concerned"); other manuscripts read "pondered," presumably to avoid this problem. Philo is clearly troubled by the theological problem and attacks (Quod D-us Immutabilis Sit, 5.21-22) those who regard the passage as meaning that G-d changes His mind. Indeed, he says explicitly that those who interpret the words to mean that G-d repented are wrong, since G-d is without change. Rather, the meaning is that G-d was concerned or reflected on the reason why He had made man. Similarly, the rabbis (San- hedrin 108a) translate, "And the L-rd was comforted that He had made man in the earth," although some (Genesis Rabbah 27.4) left the anthropomorphism intact and translated "repented," citing, in typically Midrashic fashion, an analogy with a father who rejoices when a son is born to him although he knows that he will eventually die. One of the rabbis, Rabbi 7 Michael Astour, Hellenosemitica (London, 1967), p. 212, notes that Ogygos (or Ogyges), who was the ancient king of the region where Cadmus the Phoenician later built Thebes and after whom one of the seven gates of Thebes was named, had a wife named Thebe. Her name and that of the city of Thebes (Astour, p. 158) may be derived from the Hebrew word teba ("ark," "chest"), which is employed in the Noah story in the Bible (Gen. 6.14ff.).</page><page sequence="6">36 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [6] Nehemia (ibid.), however, is troubled by this and translates the verb "repented" as "consoled," and explains that G-d was consoled that He had not created man as an angel, since then He would have brought about a revolt of the angels against Him; and another, Rabbi Levi (ibid.), explains it to mean that G-d was comforted that He had made man from the earth and that he would, presumably, therefore, be subject to death. Pseudo- Philo (3.3) piously quotes the passage as it appears in the Hebrew text and translates "repented" (penitet me). Such a notion is an obvious anthropomorphism, as admitted by such medieval commentators as Ibn Ezra and Nachmanides. It is not surprising that Celsus, Marcion, and Hiwi al-Balkhi cite the passage in support of the charge that G-d is not omniscient.8 Josephus, in a fashion often paralleled elsewhere,9 seeking to avoid such theological hornets' nests, solves the problem (Ant. 1.73) by omitting the passage altogether. Another theological problem arises when we ask why G-d should have created man only to destroy him in the Flood. In the Bible (Gen. 6.13) G-d justifies this action with the single statement to Noah that he is doing so because man has filled the earth with violence. Josephus (Ant. 1. 100) anticipates the objec- tion that it would have been reasonable (oaoppov, "discreet," 8 See Judah Rosenthal, "Hiwi al-Balkhi," Jewish Quarterly Review 38 (1947- 48), 327. 9 See, e.g., Josephus' omission (Ant. 1.28) of reference to Genesis 1.5, which declares that "there was evening and there was morning, one day," a passage which presents difficulties because the Jewish day did not end at sunrise and because it is hard to understand how there could be evening before the day on which light was created. Again, the statement (Gen. 1.26) "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" has anthropomorphic implications. Josephus (Ant. 1.32) avoids this difficulty by omitting this phrase completely and by simply reporting that G-d formed man. For additional examples, see my "Hellenizations in Josephus' Portrayal of Man's Decline," E.R. Goodenough Memorial Volume (Studies in the History ofReligions, 14, ed. by Jacob Neusner; Leiden, 1968), 345 (on Gen. 3.16); and my "Josephus' Commentary on Genesis," Jewish Quarterly Review 72 (1981-82), 125 (on Gen. 2.17) and 127 (on Gen. 8.21).</page><page sequence="7">[7] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 37 "prudent," "temperate") for G-d not to have created man rather than to create him and later destroy him.10 "No," says G-d in a strong apology, "it was the outrages (oL; fi6{Dptpov) with which they met my reverent regard (euoapetav, "piety") and goodness (dp£f )v) that constrained me to impose this penalty upon them." Philo, without raising the problem considered by Jose- phus, also stresses (Quaestiones in Genesin 1. 100 on Gen. 6. 13) that the Biblical statement (Gen. 6.13) that "the earth was filled with injustice" is as much as to say that no part of it remained empty so as to receive and support righteousness. We may note that Philo and Pseudo-Philo do not expand on this verse. The rabbis, on the other hand, in predictable fashion, identify the chief sins of the generation of the Flood as immorality (Gen. Rab. 26.5 and parallel sources cited by Ginzberg"), idolatry, violence (Gen. Rab. 31.6 and parallel sources cited by Ginz- bergl2), and rapacity (Gen. Rab. 31.3-5). Josephus likewise (Ant. 1.73) mentions the immorality of the age, when he notes that many angels now consorted with women and begot sons who were overbearing (Upp5toxi ) and disdainful of every virtue (RavTo6; D6ncpO6ag KcaXoi) because of their confidence in their strength (8&amp;a rfv tl7i T t 8Iuvagit 7CE7roieTolnv). Josephus' posture, particularly its reference to the overweening pride (63ppiToKt;, a key word in Greek tragedy) of this generation, is clearly re- dolent of Greek tragedy, where veCLEat follows ippt;. 13 The fact 10 One is reminded of the famous debate ('Erubin 13b), which lasted for two and a half years, between the Schools of Hillel and Shammai as to whether it would have been better if man had never been created. "' Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, 5 (Philadelphia, 1925), 173, n. 17. 12 Ibid. 13 Josephus similarly presents his depiction of the generation of the Tower of Babel (Ant. 1. 113-119) in terms of 5pptp; and v6Co.agt. Following the typical Greek sequence of prosperity, insolence, and punishment, Josephus first notes their prosperity (r&amp;6aiLoveiv, Ant. 1.113), then their insolence (i5ppt, Ant. 1. 113), and finally their punishment through the discord which G-d created among them. For another parallel, see my "Hellenizations in Josephus' Version</page><page sequence="8">38 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [8] that Josephus (Ant. 1.100) repeats the idea that the generation obliterated by the Flood had been guilty of ippt; (ol; t5ptiov) shows that he is looking upon the punishment meted out by G-d as the ve£Get; which follows the i5pp5t of a Greek tragedy. Ovid, likewise, in his description of the Iron Age (Metamorphoses 1. 128-162), which was the generation of the Flood, is explicit in enumerating the evils of the age: immodesty, falsehood, trickery, slyness, plotting, swindling, violence, greed, injustice, and contempt for the gods. Similarly, Lucian (De Syria Dea 12) mentions that the Flood was brought on because men were very insolent (fpptoxai tKapra) and did unlawful deeds (6eOgRtoTa Epya). A reader of the Bible might well be disturbed by the fact that G-d decides to destroy the world by a flood without apparent warning. Hence, Josephus (Ant. 1.70) goes so far as to have Adam already predicting to his contemporaries the destruction of the universe (d(pavtogbv ... Tcv 6Xcov), at one time by a violent fire (Kca' ioaXv mwp6;) and at another time by a mighty deluge of water (Kcaxd 3iav Kai ntki0o i58axoS),'4 so that two pillars were erected, one of brick and one of stone, not merely, as Josephus says, to inform mankind of the astronomical discoveries of Adam's day but also by implication to warn mankind of the impending destruction of the earth. Philo also speaks of such an alternation of fire and flood, noting that of Esther," Transactions of the American Philological Association 101 (1970), 160-162. 14 There is some question as to whether Josephus is referring to two catas- trophes that may destroy the earth or whether he means a single catastrophe, and that the world will be destroyed partly by water and partly by fire. Cf. my "Hellenizations in Josephus' Portrayal of Man's Decline" (above, note 9) p. 351, n. 3, where I indicate that it is more likely that one catastrophe is referred to; in the one case, Josephus is saying, a brick pillar will survive, whereas in the other case (water) a stone pillar will survive. Josephus' passage is found almost verbatim in the Pseudepigrapha in Vita Adae et Evae 49.3. Cf. the eschatologi- cal apocalypse in Sibylline Oracles (3.689-690): "And G-d shall judge all with war and sword, and with fire and cataclysms of rain."</page><page sequence="9">[9] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 39 "because of the constant and repeated destructions by water and fire the later generations did not receive from the former the memory of the order and sequence of events in the series of years." Pseudo-Philo (3.9), on the other hand, speaks of these alternatives only after the Flood, when he has G-d declare that if men sin He will judge them by famine, sword, fire, or pestilence, but not again by a flood. The rabbis (Zevahim 11 6a), to be sure, speak of the tumult accompanying the giving of the Torah at Sinai and the question put by the heathen kings to the pagan prophet Balaam as to whether a flood of water or a flood of fire might be coming to engulf the earth; but they do not speak of G-d pondering whether to destroy the earth by water or by fire in the days of Noah, nor do they point it out as a prediction, in fact denying that the cataclysm will occur, inas- much as G-d has sworn that He will not destroy mankind. Elsewhere, where the alternatives of a flood of fire and a flood of water are mentioned (Sanhedrin 108b) as ways by which G-d will destroy the earth, it is in connection with the ridicule which Noah's fellow men pour upon him when they see him building an ark and when he warns them that G-d will bring a flood upon them. We may here suggest that Josephus' source may well be Plato's Timaeus, 5 which declares (22C) that "there have been, 15 Moses Hadas, "Plato in Hellenistic Fusion," Journal of the History ofldeas 19 (1958), 3-13, and Hellenistic Culture: Fusion and Diffusion (New York, 1959), pp. 72-82, has noted that Plato was the most important intellectual factor in the process of Hellenization in the East during the Hellenistic period. Josephus displays his knowledge of Plato in a number of places. Thus (Against Apion 1.7) he borrows (without specifically mentioning it) from the Timaeus (22 B-C) the notion that "in the Greek world everything will be found to be moder, and dating, so to speak, from yesterday or the day before." Moreover, he correctly remarks (Against Apion 2.168-169) that the philosophy of Plato is addressed only to the few, whereas the Torah's teachings are intended for the many. Again (Against Apion 2.192), he deliberately combats the idea that G-d had collaborators in the work of creation, though he mentions the names of neither Plato nor Philo, who held such views. Furthermore, he cites Plato by name (Against Apion 2.223) as one admired by the Greeks for his dignity of character and persuasive eloquence but who is ridiculed by self-styled expert</page><page sequence="10">and will be hereafter, many diverse destructions of mankind, the greatest by fire and water, though other lesser ones are due to countless other causes." Plato here explains that confla- grations and floods alternate in destroying the inhabitants of the earth, the former allowing the dwellers by the sea to survive, the latter allowing those who live in mountainous regions to survive. But the closest parallel to Josephus is Ovid (Metamor- phoses 1.253-261), who alone, like Josephus, speaks of a divine pondering in connection with the Deluge as to whether to destroy the earth by fire or by water. Because thunderbolts are the usual weapons of Jupiter (Zeus), one might have expected, as Ovid indicates, that Jupiter would have preferred to use them, but he decided not to do so when he remembered that it had been fated that there would come a time when earth, sea, and heaven itself would burn. The reader of the account in Genesis may well wonder why both G-d and Noah did not do more to warn mankind of the impending destruction. The Bible (Gen. 6.5) states merely that statesmen. That he is acquainted with Plato is clear from his remark (Against Apion 2.224) that if one examines Plato's laws, they will be found frequently easier than the Jewish code and more closely approximating the practice of the masses. He knows, moreover (ibid.), that Plato himself (Timaeus 28C) has admitted that it is not safe to express the true opinion about G-d to the ignorant masses. He cites the opinion (Against Apion 2.225) of those who regard Plato's discourses as brilliant but empty. He likewise is aware (Against Apion 2.256) that Plato banishes the poets, including Homer, from the ideal state in order to prevent them from obscuring with their fables the correct doctrine about G-d. Finally, he declares (Against Apion 2.257) that Plato followed Moses in prescribing that the citizens must all study the laws and learn them verbatim, and that foreigners must not be permitted to mix at random with the citizens. On Josephus' indebtedness to Plato, see further Berhard Briine, Flavius Josephus und seine Schriften in ihrem Verhaltnis zum Judentume, zur grie- chisch-romischen Welt und zum Christentume (Gutersloh, 1913), pp. 194-198. See also David J. Ladouceur, "Masada: A Consideration of the Literary Evidence," Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 21 (1980), 250-251, who notes the profound influence of Plato upon the speeches of Eleazar ben Jair at Masada. 40 [10] LOUIS H. FELDMAN</page><page sequence="11">[11] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 41 G-d saw that the wickedness of man was great and that (Gen. 6.9) Noah was a righteous and wholehearted man, but it does not indicate that either G-d or Noah did anything to get mankind to repent so as to avert doom. Neither Philo nor Pseudo-Philo says anything about any attempt by G-d or Noah to induce the inhabitants of the earth to repent. The rabbis, however, expatiate on Noah's attempts to induce his fellow men to mend their wicked ways, only to have them deride him (Sanhedrin 108a-b). The very fact that Noah waited for many years, until the cedars which he had planted had grown, was due to his desire to warn his fellow men to repent in the meantime (Tanhuma Noah 5); indeed, Noah took fifty-two years (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 23) or 120 years (Sifre Numbers, end),16 in order to induce the evil-doers to repent. In fact, the rabbis (Gen. Rab. 30.7) interpret the phrase "a righteous man" (Gen. 6.9), which is applied to Noah, to mean that he was one who forewarned others, since only such a person deserves a designa- tion of this type. Josephus, similarly (Ant. 1.74), stresses that Noah, in indignation (6uosxpaivcov) at the conduct of his fellow men, and viewing their counsels with displeasure (&amp;6r5i); EXwv), urged them to come to a better frame of mind (&amp;6tvotav) and to change their deeds (Tg tpiet; ie;acptpepv).17 More- 16 Cited by Ginzberg (above, note 11) 5.174, n. 19, with parallels. 17 Henry St. John Thackeray, Josephus, 4 (Loeb Classical Library, Cam- bridge, Mass., 1930), 35, note c, remarks that Book 1 of the Sibylline Oracles (which contains Jewish, Christian, and even some pagan material) devotes fifty lines to two of Noah's addresses. The parallels, however, which he cites with 1 Peter 3.20 and with 2 Peter 2.5 in the New Testament are not apt, since in the former case we read only of G-d's patience during the days of Noah, while in the latter instance we read of Noah as a herald (KcpuKca) of righteousness, an honorific term that does not necessarily indicate that he preached to his fellow men. This portrait of Noah the preacher is reminiscent of a Cynic proclaiming "diatribes" on street corers - a scene that was frequent during this period of antiquity, as we can see from the works of Horace (see especially Satires 2.3), Menippus, Meleager, Petronius, Epictetus, Dio Chrysostom, and Seneca. It was such a diatribe that profoundly influenced the style of St. Paul in his sermon to the Athenians on the Areopagus (Acts 17.22-31). See Moses Hadas, Hellenistic</page><page sequence="12">over, Josephus, in his downplaying of theological concerns, does not agree with that rabbinic tradition (Book ofJashar 5.6- 8, 11) which ascribes to G-d the credit for Noah's concern with preaching to his fellow men. In a unique apology for Noah, Josephus adds (Ant. 1.74) that Noah feared that his fellow inhabitants, far from listening to his pleas, would even murder him,18 and so he, with his wives (yuvatiKcv), sons, and sons' wives, left the country. This is calculated to answer the implied charge that Noah should not have separated himself from his fellows but should have sought to influence them to repent. Again, one might well be critical of G-d for his negativism in simply seeking to destroy the human race without presenting any plan to start anew. The Greek reader might well have contrasted this apparent callousness with the statement in Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound (232-233) that Zeus intended to blot out (ator6cioa;) the entire race of mankind and to create (q(pti at) another new race. Similarly, Ovid (Metamorphoses 1.250-252) notes Zeus' promise to the other gods on Olympus Culture: Fusion and Diffusion (New York, 1959), pp. 142-146; Rudolf Bult- mann, Der Stil der paulinischen Predigt und die kynisch-stoische Diatribe, in Forschungen zur Religion und Literature des Alten und Neuen Testaments, vol. 13 (Gottingen, 1910); und Paul Wendland, Die hellenistisch-romische Kultur, in ihren Beziehungen zu Judentum und Christentum, 3rd ed. (Tubingen, 1912), pp. 75-81. 18 Rabbinic tradition (Sanhedrin 108b) remarks on the derision which his contemporaries cast upon Noah and indicates (Gen. Rab. 32.8) that if his fellow men had really known why he had entered the ark they would not have allowed him to do so; but the rabbis do not speak of threats against his life. Ginzberg (above, note 11) 5.177-178, n. 25, remarking that Josephus' detail that Noah emigrated to another country is unique with him, comments that Josephus probably wished thus to explain how the ark came to rest on Mount Ararat in Armenia, whereas Noah had lived in Palestine. But, we may counter, it is not remarkable for the ark to have floated in the flood-water that had lasted so long. It seems more likely that Josephus introduced this detail to defend Noah against a possible charge of having deserted his fellow men in order to save his own life and the lives of his family. We may, as a parallel, note Virgil's defense of Aeneas' departure from Troy in Book 2 of the Aeneid against similar possible charges. 42 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [12]</page><page sequence="13">[131 JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 43 that he will replace the wicked race of man with another race of wondrous origin not like the earlier one. The Bible (Gen. 6.13) declares simply G-d's decision to destroy the inhabitants, with no indication that He had any positive goal of starting anew to complement this negative decision. Neither Philo nor Pseudo- Philo nor the rabbis have any parallel to Josephus' unique comment, offered to defend G-d against the charge of mere negativism, that G-d had decided not merely to blot out the existing race of mankind but to replace it with another race free of vice (Ant. 1.75). One of the most enigmatic phrases in the Biblical account of Noah is the statement (Gen. 6.9) that Noah was a man "right- eous and wholehearted in his generations" (zaddik tamim hayah bedorota v), which the Septuagint renders 5cKacto0; rEt0o 6v v v r yevE cF auroi ("just, perfect in his generation"). Prof. David Daube has called my attention to the parallel in Luke 16.8 in the parable of the steward. Philo (Quod D-us Immutabi- lis Sit 25.117) quotes the Septuagint and consequently praises Noah to the highest degree (De Abrahamo 5.27), since he says that justice is the chief of the virtues. Inasmuch as Noah is perfect, Philo (DeAbrahamo 6.34) declares that he possessed all the virtues; and yet, he, too, qualifies this view by remarking (De Abrahamo 7.36) that the statement that Noah was perfect in his generation indicates that he was not absolutely good but only in comparison with the men of his time. Pseudo-Philo (3.4) describes Noah as iustus et inmaculatus in progenie sua ("a just man and unblemished in his generation"); but he, too, qualifies this praise of Noah by saying (3.4) that Noah found grace and mercy (gratiam et misericordiam), implying that Noah did not really deserve all the kindness and concern shown to him by G-d, whereas the Bible (Gen. 6.8) speaks more positively about Noah in declaring that he found favor (hen) in the eyes of the L-rd. The rabbis similarly found themselves in a dilemma. To declare Noah, the ancestor of all non-Jews ("sons of Noah") perfect, would, indeed, raise a question as to where Moses and the Torah marked any advance. Indeed, there is a</page><page sequence="14">debate in the Talmud as to how righteous Noah really was. One view, that of the second-century Rabbi Nehemiah (Gen. Rab. 30.9) and of the third-century Resh Lakish (Sanhedrin 108a) is that Noah deserves even greater praise, since he was righteous in a wicked generation. On the other hand, the third-century Rabbi Judah (Gen. Rab. 30.9) and Rabbi Johanan ben Nap- paha (Sanhedrin 108a) remark that Noah was righteous only in comparison with those of his time. Rabbi Johanan even goes so far as to declare (Gen. Rab. 32.6) that Noah was so lacking in faith that if the water of the Flood had not reached his ankles he would not have entered the ark. We may suggest here that one factor in this debate was perhaps the fact that the Church Fathers'9 looked upon Noah as a type of Christ and stressed that he was pleasing to G-d despite the fact that he was not circum- cised. Josephus, likewise seeking to steer an even course between excessive praise for the father of the Gentiles and a disdainful sneer, twice remarks (Ant. 1.75 and 1.99) that G-d loved Noah for his righteousness (Tf; 8tKatooiovlg; fiynraoe, ,'ni 8tKato(iUvt .... tayaTov) but omits completely the statement that he was perfect. There is a striking similarity between Josephus' language (Ant. 1.76) in stating that G-d had put into Noah's mind (brnoOeevoo) "the device and means of salvation on this wise" (rqXavOv ... Kal nbpov 7pbo acwzOrpiav), and the account of the flood in Apollodorus (1.7.2) (whose date is uncertain though he is probably a contemporary of Josephus), where we read that Deucalion constructed his ark through the advice (bnoOejevov) of Prometheus. Again, the second-century Lucian (De Syria Dea 12), using language similar to that of Josephus (Ant. 1.73), declares that Deucalion's salvation was on this wise (f 86 ocoTpi r f8e Fyevexo), namely, that he (Deucalion) built a large chest (ia'pvaKa) into which he put his children and their wives (7ai8a TS icai yuvatKcag taurou) (cf.

FELDMAN</page><page sequence="15">[ 15] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 45 was, indeed, thinking of Deucalion is, moreover, indicated by the fact that the word which Josephus uses for Noah's ark (;Ao,vaKa, Ant. 1.77) is the same word which is used by Apollo- dorus (1.7.2), by Lucian (De Dea Syria 12), and by Josephus' contemporary Plutarch (2.968f), in connection with the ark of Deucalion, rather than the word which is employed by the Septuagint (KlPtozbc, Gen. 6.14) and in Philo (De Plantatione 11.43).20 That Josephus' choice of the word Xdpvac for Noah's ark is significant is to be seen from the fact that when the same word "ark" (tebah) occurs in the Bible (Exodus 2.3) as the place where Moses' mother placed him when he was an infant, whereas the Septuagint renders it by the word Oitpi; (a word presumably derived from the Hebrew), Josephus, perhaps because he wished to avoid a word which is not found in classical writers, did not use the word Xcapvc, which he had used for Noah's ark, but instead adopted (Ant. 2.224) the word n;tiy,ia ("plaited basket"), even though Xapvat would appear to be the appropriate word for a basket in which a baby is exposed, to judge from Simonides (37. 1), Apollonius of Rhodes (1.622), and Diodorus Siculus (5.62). It would seem, moreover, that Josephus adopted the word )Xpvat directly from Nicolaus of Damascus, whom he quotes (Ant. 1.94-95) (even to the point of giving the number of the book - 96 - where the passage appears), as saying that many refugees found safety on a certain mountain in Armenia at the 20 It is this same word, kXpvct, that Josephus employs when he refers (Ant. 20.25) to the remains of the ark in Armenia "in which report has it that Noah was saved from the flood." We may here suggest that one factor that led Josephus to select the word Xdpvga for Noah's ark was his desire to keep the word Ktlp3o6; for the Ark of the Covenant. We may note, indeed, that there is only one place (Jewish War 5.384) where he uses the word 3Apvca for the Ark of the Covenant. We may also remark that whereas the Hebrew has the same word (tebah) for the ark in which Moses was placed (Exodus 2.3) and where the Septuagint has the word Oiptv, Josephus (Ant. 2.220) has a different word, nXk/yia, presumably because he did not, as he did with Noah's ark, have a Greek source that employed the word XOpv4t.</page><page sequence="16">time of the flood, including a man, transported in an ark (AaapvaKoc)21 "who might well be (yF/votro 86'v) the same man of whom Moses, the Jewish legislator, wrote." That Josephus, indeed, identified Noah with the survivor of the Babylonian flood is clear from Josephus' remark (Ant. 1.93) that the Flood and the ark are mentioned by all who have written histories of the barbarians, whereupon he cites, in particular, Berossus, Hieronymus the Egyptian (the author of an ancient history of Phoenicia), and Mnaseas of Patara. Especially significant is Josephus' statement (Ant. 1.92) that the dove which Noah sent to explore the condition of the earth returned smeared with mud (7ne7rl3XCotv1;), a detail which, as Thackeray22 has remarked, is not found in the Bible (Gen. 8. 11) but does appear in Berossus (ap. Syncellus, 53-56). Finally, that Josephus iden- tified Noah with the survivor of the Babylonian flood is clear from the passage in his work Against Apion (1. 130), in which he states that Berossus mentions the ark (iapvaKos, though this is not actually the term used by Berossus) in which Noah was saved when it landed on a mountain in Armenia. In the passage in question, Berossus refers to Xisuthrus, rather than Noah, as we see from Syncellus, who here quotes Berossus; but the fact that Josephus relates it as pertaining to Noah shows that he (and presumably his readers) had identified the two. We may remark that such an identification of Jewish religious concepts with pagan ideas is seen already in the Letter ofAristeas (16), where the presumably Jewish author identifies G-d with Zeus: "G-d ... is He Whom all men worship, and we, too, Your Majesty, though we address Him differently as Zeus and Dis." In making such an equation the author is following in the time-honored footsteps of Herodotus, who constantly makes such equations: for example, the Egyptian deities Bast and Isis are equated with 21 In Berossus (ap. Syncellus 53-56) the ship of the Deluge is called aK6(po;, itPSiov, and vawi, but not XApvat; and hence it would seem that Josephus has adopted the word from the account of Deucalion. 22 Thackeray (above, note 17), vol. 4, pp. 44-45, note b. 46 [16] LOUIS H. FELDMAN</page><page sequence="17">[17] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 47 Artemis and Demeter (2.59) and Horus with Apollo (2.144). Philo (De Confusione Linguarum 2.2-5) also notes that atheist intellectuals denounce the Jewish inconsistency in, on the one hand, proclaiming that the Bible is unique, while, on the other hand, including in the Bible stories which are very similar to the Greek myths. They cite, in particular, the parallels between the story of the attempt of the Giants to reach heaven by piling Mount Pelion on Ossa on Olympus, which is said to be similar to the story of the Tower of Babel. Josephus' contemporary Plutarch likewise (Quaestiones Conviviales 4.6.2) cites what he considers to be conclusive evidence identifying Tabernacles and even the Sabbath as festivals in honor of Dionysus. In response to the charge that the Flood is only a myth, Josephus, in addition to citing the evidence of Berossus and others (Ant. 1.94), as noted above, also remarks that relics of the ark have long been preserved in Armenia (Ant. 1.95), though elsewhere (Ant. 20.24-25 he states that the remains of the ark are still to be seen in a district called Carron, presumably identical with Korduene in Mesopotamia near the Armenian border, where rabbinic sources (Onkeles on Gen. 8.4)23 and Berossus agree that the ark came to rest. Neither Philo nor Pseudo-Philo nor the rabbis - none of them being historians - cite external evidence for the historicity of the Flood, nor do they claim that remains of the ark are still to be seen. When Noah emerges from the ark, the Bible (Gen. 8.20) declares simply that he built an altar unto the L-rd, but it gives no reason for the sacrifices which Noah then proceeds to offer. Neither does Pseudo-Philo (3.8), who simply quotes the Bibli- cal text. Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 2.50 on Gen. 8.20) asks why Noah did so when he had not been ordered to do so, and replies that it was an act of gratitude. The rabbis also ask how Noah was able to arrive at the idea of sacrificing, and they typically, with their emphasis on the process of reasoning, conclude (Gen. Rab. 34.9) that he was able to deduce it logically 23 See Ginzberg (above, note 11) 5.186, n. 48, and parallels noted there.</page><page sequence="18">from the fact that G-d had commanded him to take into the ark more clean than unclean animals, the surplus being presumably for the sacrifices later to be offered. Another explanation, to be sure found only in late sources,24 is that Noah brought the sacrifice because he sought forgiveness for his sins. Josephus (Ant. 1.96), attempting to give a reasonable explanation, states that Noah, fearful that G-d might send another flood, offered a sacrifice to beseech Him not to do so. There is an obvious anthropomorphism in the Biblical state- ment (Gen. 8.21), retained in the Septuagint, which Josephus generally followed, that G-d smelled the sweet savor of Noah's sacrifice. Philo (De Congressu Quaerendae Eruditionis Gratia 21.115) removes the anthropomorphism by explaining that the word "smelled" means "accepted," "for G-d is not of human form (tv0pon7c6iop(po;), nor has he need of nostrils or any other parts as organs." Likewise, Pseudo-Philo (3.8) removes the anthropomorphism by paraphrasing "and it was accepted" (acceptum est) by the Lord as an odor of rest (odor requietionis). Josephus (Ant. 1.92) once again avoids the problem by omitting this detail and by stating simply that Noah sacrificed to G-d and that G-d, Who loved him for his righteousness, signified to him that He would grant his prayers (Ant. 1.99).25 The figure of Noah gains in stature through the fact that he does not sacrifice to G-d silently, as in the Bible (Gen. 8.20), but is concerned with the future of mankind and, like Abraham (Gen. 18.23-30), reasons with G-d (Ant. 1.96) to maintain the primitive good order (eiTa5iat) of nature and not to send another calamity upon mankind,26 but to spare those who, because of their goodness (Xpraozr6Tira), had survived the Flood. In the Biblical account (Gen. 8.21-22), the attention is 24 See Ginzberg (above, note 11), 5. 186, n. 49, who cites Zohar Hadash Noah, 29a, and parallels. 25 For other examples of Josephus' avoidance of anthropomorphisms, see the literature cited above, note 9. 26 The Agada also knows Noah's motive in sacrificing; see Tanhuma Noach 1 (ed. Buber, 17). 48 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [18]</page><page sequence="19">[ 19] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 49 focused on G-d, Who promises not to make any wholesale destruction of man in the future. Josephus shifts the attention to Noah, who, through his pleading (Ant. 1.97) that if there were another flood the just people would suffer still more than the miscreants who had perished in the first deluge, persuades G-d to promise that there would be no such deluge again in the future. In Genesis (9.11) G-d makes His promise without reference to Noah; but Josephus exalts Noah by having G-d say that it is at Noah's petition that He has decided to refrain in the future from exacting such a penalty for the crimes of men. Noah thus becomes a champion of mankind, similar to Abraham, asking G-d not to send another flood, so that men may devote themselves to recultivating the earth and building cities - the hallmark of civilization. In Genesis 8.21 there would seem to be a theological problem in the apparent allusion to a doctrine of original sin, since G-d declares that He "will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth." Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 2.54 on Gen. 8.21) seems to subscribe to a doctrine of original sin when he declares that man's inclination toward evil exists from his youth, "which is all but from his very swaddling bands, as if he were to a certain extent united, and, at the same time, nourished and grown, with sins." Pseudo-Philo (3.9) quotes the Biblical pas- sage without further exposition.27 The rabbis have ambiguous feelings on the matter. On the one hand, in answer to the question of the Emperor Antoninus, Rabbi Judah the Prince (Sanhedrin 91 b) was at first ready to subscribe to the view that the evil impulse bears sway over a man even from the formation of the embryo, and only later promulgated the view that the evil 27 The manuscripts of Pseudo-Philo (3.9), however, read desiit, and the meaning would then be that the guise (figura) of man's heart has ceased (desiit) from his youth. Leopold Cohn, "An Apocryphal Work Ascribed to Philo of Alexandria," Jewish Quarterly Review, Old Series 10 (1898), 310, plausibly emends desiit to desipit, "is foolish," and the emendation is adopted by Daniel J. Harrington, ed., Pseudo-Philon: Les Antiquites Bibliques, 1 (Paris, 1976), 70.</page><page sequence="20">50 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [20] impulse holds sway only from the moment of birth. On the other hand, they insist (Gen. Rab. 9.7) that the impulses natural to man are not in themselves evil. Josephus (Ant. 1.92), seeking to avoid theological controversy, omits this passage completely from his paraphrase. One of the anomalies of Jewish law is that in the case of the prohibitions of blasphemy, murder, and theft, the Noachides ("Sons of Noah," that is, Gentiles) are subject to greater legal restrictions than are Jews. Thus, for example (Sanhedrin 57b), the killing of a fetus by a non-Jew is regarded as murder, but this is not so regarded if done by a Jew. To be sure, the Septuagint renders Genesis 9.6: "He that sheds a man's blood, instead of his blood shall his own be shed," but the rabbinic interpretation (Sanhedrin 57b) is to punctuate the verse differently: "He who sheds the blood of man within a man [i.e., an embryo], shall his blood be shed." Elsewhere, as numerous scholars, most recently Goldenberg,28 have shown, Josephus was amply aware of rab- 28 David Goldenberg, The Halakhah in Josephus and in Tannaitic Literature: A Comparative Study (Diss., Ph.D., Dropsie University, Philadelphia, 1978). As to Josephus' knowledge of Aggadah, we may note that he himself (Vita, 8-9) says that he received an excellent education in his native Jerusalem, "gaining a reputation for an excellent memory and understanding," and that while a mere lad of fourteen he won such universal applause for his love of letters that "the chief priests and the leading men of the city used constantly to come to me for precise information on some particular in our ordinances." While it is true that Josephus is hardly averse to exaggeration, he had so many enemies that it seems hard to believe that there would be no basis to such a boast. For a listing and discussion (hardly exhaustive) of many parallels between Josephus and rabbinic midrashim, see Salomo Rappaport, Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus (Wien, 1930); Geza Vermes, Scripture and Tradition in Judaism: Haggadic Studies (Leiden, 1961); and my own articles, in addition to those listed in notes 9 and 13: "Abraham the Greek Philosopher in Josephus," Transactions of the American Philological Association, 99 (1968), 143-156; "Abraham the General in Josephus," in Frederick E.

It would have been embar- rassing presumably to expect more of Gentiles than of Jews, and hence Josephus omits any such interpretation. On the contrary, Josephus goes so far as to declare that abortion is prohibited for Jews (Against Apion 2.202), going beyond the point where the rabbis themselves go, who, while opposing abortion by Jews, did not regard it as a variety of murder. "Josephus as a Biblical Interpreter: The "Aqedah," Jewish Quarterly Review 75 (1985), 212-252; "Josephus' Portrait of Deborah," in A. Caquot, M. Hadas- Lebel, and J.

On the numerous parallels between Josephus' pre- sumed contemporary, Pseudo-Philo, in his BiblicalAntiquities, and midrashim, see my Prolegomenon to the re-issue of M.R. James, The Biblical Antiquities of Philo (New York, 1971), especially pp. lxviii-lxx. The question of Philo's possible knowledge of midrashim was much debated at the time when Harry A. Wolfson issued his monumental work, Philo, 2 vols. (Cambridge, Mass., 1947). See, in particular, Bernard J. Bamberger, "The Dating of Aggadic Materials," Journal of Biblical Literature 68 (1949), 115-123, who notes, for example, that, inasmuch as the second-century Rabbi Meir (Megillah 13a) states, as does the Septuagint (Esther 2.7), that Mordecai had married Esther, it is more likely that the translators of the Septuagint were acquainted with this ancient tradition than that Rabbi Meir consulted the Septuagint (if he consulted a Greek translation it would surely have been Aquila's, which does not have this tradition). Similarly, the plague of 'arob is understood by the second-century Rabbi Nehemiah to consist of stinging insects (Exodus Rabbah 11.3), whereas the Hebrew is generally understood to refer to varied wild beasts; again, this is the explanation of the Septuagint (Exodus 8.17). Moreover, one of the frescoes of the third-century Dura Europos synagogue depicts Hiel (1 Kings 16.34), one of the confederates of Baal, crouching beneath the altar while a snake approaches to bite him; but such a story is not mentioned in a Hebrew source until much later midrashim (Exodus Rabbah 15.15; Pesikta Rabbati 4.13a) and not fully until the thirteenth-century Yalkut (on 1 Kings 18.26). Hence, that tradition must have been much more ancient.</page><page sequence="22">52 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [22] Josephus, in his eagerness to point out parallels between Jewish and non-Jewish stories and symbolism, notes (Ant. 1. 103) that the rainbow, which G-d established (Gen. 9.13) as a token of the covenant between Him and man, is "among the people there" (nap&amp;a tro; FcKEl) believed to be G-d's bow (6roov). Inasmuch as the context of the Noah story is Babylonia, the reference would seem to be to the Babylonians rather than to the Greeks; but since, as we have noted, the Greeks commonly equated their gods and their tales with those of other peoples, the reader would more probably identify the bow with the implement of the deities Apollo and Artemis, both of whom are called xo0o(p6po;, "bow-bearing" (Homer, Iliad 21.483; Homeric Hymn to Apollo 13.126). A favorite epithet of both Artemis (Sophocles, Fragment 401) and especially of Apollo (Iliad 1. 14 etc.) is eKflPooXo; ("attaining his aim," understood by later writers as "far-shooting"). The rainbow to the Greeks (Homer, Iliad 17.547), however, was Zeus' sign of war or of a storm that forces people to stop their work and afflicts their flocks. It is interesting that Philo, perhaps because of this identification of the rainbow with war, argues (Quaestiones in Genesin 2.64 on Gen. 9.13-17) that the bow that is spoken of in this Biblical passage cannot be the rainbow, inasmuch as the bow in Genesis has its own special nature and substance, whereas the rainbow does not. Pseudo-Philo says nothing about the rainbow in that part of the narrative dealing with Noah, but mentions it only when he quotes G-d's assurance to Moses that his (Moses') rod will be in His sight a sign comparable to Noah's rainbow. The rabbis apparently are troubled that G-d should have set the rainbow in the cloud as a kind of afterthought of the Flood and that He seemingly did not have the foresight to do so earlier. Hence, they declare (Aboth 5.6) that the rainbow is one of the ten things created on the eve of the Sabbath of creation at twilight. Josephus carefully avoids stating that G-d created the rainbow, but rather declares that He displayed (aicoorlaivov) it; presumably it had been created long before. Moreover, in the Bible (Gen. 9.16) there is a clearly anthropomorphic picture in</page><page sequence="23">[23] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 53 G-d's statement that He will look upon the rainbow that He may remember His covenant with mankind. Philo, Pseudo- Philo, and the rabbis omit reference to this last anthropomor- phism, and Josephus (Ant. 1.103) reduces the anthropomor- phism by having G-d state that by His bow He will indicate the truce from destruction by flood that men are to have. Neither the Bible (Gen. 9.18), nor Philo nor Pseudo-Philo, nor the rabbis say anything about the descent of Noah's sons from the mountains to the plains after the Flood; and only later does the Bible (Gen. 11.2) note that the generation of the Tower of Babel found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there. Josephus (Ant. 1. 109), however, declares that Noah's three sons were the first to descend from the mountains to the plains (eiS &amp;a 7re&amp;ia) and persuaded the rest of mankind, who, fearing another flood, were afraid of settling in the plains and hence reluctant to make a descent (Kar&amp;flaanv) from the heights (&amp;aro rCov bti&amp;C)ov), to take courage and to follow their example. The rabbis (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer, 11) similarly remark on mankind's fear of a second flood; but a much closer parallel to Josephus' account will be found in Josephus' favorite, Plato (Laws 3.677B1-3), who notes that only the hill shepherds - "small sparks of the human race preserved on the tops of mountains" - managed to escape the Flood, and that since the cities in the plain and on the seacoast were utterly destroyed they feared to descend (Karaflaivelv) from the heights (eK ... riiv b6¢lAiov) into the plains (im ra neSia). The discussion that follows in Josephus (Ant. 1.110-112), which has no parallel in the Bible, in Philo, in Pseudo-Philo, and in rabbinic literature, of the failure of Noah's descendants to send out colonies (aoXXetv aTCnotiac), due to an increase in population (noXuavOpo7nriav), is, indeed, reminiscent of Hero- dotus' description (1.94) of the founding of Etruria by Lydians due to lack of food, presumably owing to overpopulation. To be sure, the Midrash (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer, 24) also notes a rapid increase in population, remarking that women gave birth to sextuplets; but it says nothing about the founding of colonies.</page><page sequence="24">54 LOUIS H. FELDMAN [24] Josephus also cites another motive for sending out colonies, namely so that the inhabitants might not quarrel with one another (giL araCai6oitsv), a motive which is reminiscent of that which led Abraham to divide his land with Lot (Ant. 1.169). It is such quarreling (oa&amp;aotS, in Corcyra) which Thucydides (3.82- 84) so bewails and which David (Ant. 7.372) asks his sons to cease and which Solomon (Ant. 7.337) asks to be free from. The episode of the drunkenness of Noah raises the question why, if it was Ham who had seen his naked father, Noah pronounced a curse not upon the culprit but upon Ham's son Canaan. Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 2.77 on Gen. 9.27) asks this question and replies, though with no Biblical base, that both father and son practiced the same wickedness and, secondly, that actually the father, Ham, in any case, felt greatly saddened by the fact that his son Canaan had been cursed. Elsewhere Philo (De Sobrietate 44ff.) goes to great lengths to explain that Canaan actively participated in the insult and that wherever Ham is a name for vice in the quiescent state, Canaan is the name for vice when it passes into active movement. Pseudo-Philo omits the incident altogether, presumably because he felt it unbecoming. The rabbis (Gen. Rab. 36.7) explain that Noah could not curse Ham himself because the latter had already been blessed by G-d (Gen. 9. 1). Others (Gen. Rab. 36.7) say that Canaan deserved to be cursed because it had been he who had drawn the attention of Ham to Noah's nakedness and drunkenness. Still others (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 23) actually declare that it was Canaan who had castrated Noah. Josephus (Ant. 1.142), however, realizing that such rabbinic interpretations are not readily derived from the plain meaning of the text, prefers to abide by the literal meaning of the text and explains very simply and reasonably that Noah did not curse Ham himself because of his nearness of kin (oyy7evetav). To justify the severity of the punishment, Josephus (Ant. 1.141) adds that Ham showed the sight of his naked father to his brothers with mockery (fTciyeck)v), a detail paralleled in Philo (De Sobrietate 7.32).</page><page sequence="25">[25] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALILELS 55 In summary, Josephus' version of the Noah pericope, far from being a mere paraphrase of the Biblical narrative, whether based on the original Hebrew or on the Septuagint, shows careful and deliberate additions, modifications and substrac- tions, largely motivated by apologetic concerns, but also arising from his aim to synthesize Jewish and Hellenistic culture. On the one hand, Josephus desired to highlight the character of Noah, the ancestor of the "Sons of Noah," the nations of the world as we see, for example, in the scene in which Noah after the Flood appeals to G-d, like an earlier version of Abraham reasoning with G-d, asking Him to maintain good order and not to repeat the calamity of the Flood in the future. With such a portrayal Josephus sought to compliment the Gentiles. On the other hand, he set for himself the goal of defending and glorifying the Jewish people by reducing the role of Noah, and by not expecting more of the Sons of Noah, as did the rabbis, in those commandments incumbent upon them. In particular, the fact that Josephus' account is much less concentrated than it is in the Bible would appear to diminish the centrality of Noah. Inasmuch as during the period that Josephus was writing his Antiquities, the Jews were apparently experiencing some suc- cess in winning converts,29 pagan intellectuals had counterat- tacked with ridicule of Jewish theology and historic leadership. Hence, Josephus felt obliged to defend his people and, in particular, the historicity of the Bible upon which Jewish history rested. In the case of the Noah story, he does so not merely by appealing to the evidence of such non-Jewish writers as Berossus, who had mentioned a flood, but also by employing language which would clearly identify the Flood with the flood of the Greek mythical figure Deucalion. Moreover, Josephus 29 For a summary of the evidence, see my "Proselytism and Syncretism" (in Hebrew), in Menahem Stern and Zvi Baras, eds., World History of the Jewish People, First Series: The Diaspora in the Hellenistic-Roman World (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 188-207, 340-345, 378-380; and my article, "The Omnipresence of the G-d-Fearers," in Biblical Archaeology Review 12.5 (Sept.-Oct. 1986), 58- 69.</page><page sequence="26">has removed troublesome anthropomorphisms and has defended G-d against the charge of capriciousness. The fact that he casts the generation of the Flood in the classical mold of those who have shown insolence and who now receive their deserved punishment presents the narrative in the outline of a Greek tragedy, which his intellectual readers would surely have understood and appreciated. Parallels with Plato and Herodo- tus, as well as with Apollodorus and with motifs later found in Lucian, would likewise serve to make the narrative more readily intelligible to a Greek audience. The special flavor of Josephus' version may be especially appreciated when it is compared with that of Philo, Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiqui- ties, and the rabbis, particularly in the midrashic tradition. In general, Philo is more philosophical and more attuned to allegory, and Pseudo-Philo is eager to remain closer to the Biblical text, while the rabbis take greater liberties, but with no primary intention toward apologetics, whereas Josephus' chief goal is precisely to defend his people against the canards that were circulating so widely in his day. On the whole, he avoids the theological discussions of which Philo is so fond, since his main goal is to write factual history. In point of fact, however, his history is a glorious, if sometimes subtle, defense of his people, fully comparable to his work Against Apion.30 30 I am grateful to Professors David Daube and Daniel Schwartz for helpful suggestions in connection with this article. Most recently an article by Andre Paul, "Flavius Josephus' 'Antiquities of the Jews': An Anti-Christian Mani- festo," New Testament Studies 31 (1985), 473-480, appeared, in which the author argues that Josephus' substitution (Ant. 1.103) of the word gaOlxav ("truce") for the word berith (Gen. 9.9, Septuagint 8tailKlnv) is due to his desire to dissociate himself from the New Testament's emphasis on the doctrine of the "new covenant." We may, however, reply that if, indeed, Josephus is thus writing an anti-Christian manifesto, we would have expected him to be more open about it, since he had nothing to fear from the Christians at the time that he wrote the Antiquities, inasmuch as they were few in numbers and were hardly held in favor by the Emperor Domitian, during whose reign Josephus issued his work. A polemic which takes about 1,900 years to be revealed is hardly an effective polemic. Moreover, the fact that Josephus (Ant. 20.198-200) (a 56 [26] LOUIS H. FELDMAN</page><page sequence="27">[27] JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF NOAH AND ITS PARALLELS 57 passage whose authenticity has seldom been questioned) is so laudatory of James, who is termed "the brother of the one called the Christ," seems hardly consistent with this view that he was carrying on a polemic against Christianity. The absence of the term &amp;tafiKrv, we may suggest, is due to Josephus' desire to avoid the national complications of the covenant and to his eagerness (es- pecially important in view of his relations with and his indebtedness to the Roman government) to view Judaism as a religion rather than as a state, as Betsy H. Amaru, "Land Theology in Josephus' Jewish Antiquities," Jewish Quarterly Review 71 (1980-81), 201-229, has suggested.</page></plain_text>
