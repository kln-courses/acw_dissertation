<plain_text><page sequence="1">86 A " new " culture from Northern Rhodesia is fully described and its relationships are assessed. THE NEWLY DISCOVERED Nachikufu Culture of Northern Rhodesia AND THE POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN SMITHFIELD CULTURE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS J. DESMOND CLARK, MI.A., F.R.A.I. (Read April 4, 1950.) Before the war little or nothing was known of the prehistoric cultures of the great plateau country between Lakes Mweru and Nyasa, which comprises the greater part of what has conveniently been called North-eastern Rhodesia. From the apparent ease with which bored stones were collected by Sir Robert Codrington at the beginning of the century, it was inf erred that this adjunct to the digging- stick was at one time in common use in that area, but whether by Stone Age or Bantu inhabitants was unknown.1 The occurrence also of occasional pecked and polished stone axes hinted at a possible flowering here of a Late Stone Age culture. In 1944 and 1945 Mr. F. B. Macrae and Mr. D. G. Lancaster began collecting from several surface sites at Mporokoso on the western side of the plateau, at Mpulungu on the southern shore of Lake Tanganyika, at the Kalambo Falls, at Chibote near the edge of the Pambashye Swamps and elsewhere. From an examination of the material from all these surface sites it became apparent, if the associations could be accepted as true ones, that there occurred on the plateau a group of industries showing a number of traits in common with the Smithfield, and in particular the Smithfield " N ", culture of South Africa. Under the title "A Proto-Smithfield (?) Industry from Mporokoso, Northern Rhodesia I, I wrote a description (unpublished) of the most interesting of these sites, but while it proved possible to draw attention to these typological affinities between North-eastern Rhodesia and South Africa, it was impossible to show that any cultural connection existed between the two places. Within this area also there occurred numerous examples of a schematic or geometric art which might or might not be connected with the Stone Age Cultures. It became abundantly clear therefore that excavations were essential if we were to learn more of this interesting group of industries. In distribution these possibly new elements were found to occur from the Luapula and Lake Mweru in the north-west to Lake Tanganyika following the highlands south of the Rukwa Rift; probably into Nyasaland, down both sides of the Luangwa Valley, but not apparently in the Valley itself; into Mkushi district to the Lunsemfwa River and along the Zambesi/Congo Watershed. Apart from the Luangwa Valley, the whole of this area is one of rather undulating plateau country, the flatness of which is relieved by occasional belts of higher uplands giving place locally to long broken ridges or isolated rocky hills. The most notable</page><page sequence="2">87 hill feature is the 5,500-foot (1,675 m.) high Muchinga Escarpment which forms a backbone of older rocks running north-east/south-west down the middle of our area and constitutes the western boundary of the Luangwa Valley. The remainder of the plateau west of the Luangwa slopes gently from 5,500 feet near Abercorn in the north-east, to 3,500 feet (1,675-1,065 m.) and less at the Luapula and Lake Mweru. East of the Luangwa the plateau resumes its undulating surface sloping gradually up to the Luangwa/Nyasa Watershed. The Muchingas and the eastern part of the plateau abound in caves and rock-shelters, as also does the eastern part of the Zambesi/Congo divide. All this fairly high country is comparatively well watered and is (with the exception of the swamp areas and the valleys of the Chambesi and other of the large rivers) heavily wooded. This savannah or savannah woodland (predominantly Isoberlinia and Brachystegia) enjoys a some- what higher rainfall than the rest of the territory, being on an average between 40 and 60 inches. Temperatures vary between 600 and 80? F. as an average. The 50-mile-wide (80 km.) and hot Luangwa Valley, on the other hand, is entrenched some 1,000 feet (300 m.) below the plateau. Much of it is still infested by tsetse-fly and supports only a Copaifera mupane woodland, but teems with game of all kinds. Ecologically, therefore, the setting is one of open savannah woodland, well watered and comparatively cool, a type of country which stretches over the western and north-western territorial boundaries into the Congo and Northern Angola. THE COURSE OF EXCAVATION MPIKA In the dry season of 1948, the opportunity for which we had been wait- ing occurred and excavations were con- ducted at Nachikufu, in the Muchinga Escarpment some 30 miles (48 km.) south of Mpika. The potentialities of this site had been noted by Professor C. van Riet Lowe when he visited Nachikufu in 1936.2 The site consists of a small rock-shelter and a cave, situated at the north end of a prominent bluff from which the site derives its name. Both semi-naturalistic and schematic paintings occur., the former confined to the cave. the latter in the main to the rock-shelter. The full report on these and subsequent excavations has not yet been completed, but a summary of the findings must be given here. The main cave is some 100 feet (30 m.) in width at the drip line and at the left-hand side extends some 80 feet (24 m.) into the rock, the roof being on an average 20 feet (6 m.) above the cave earth-floor. The deposits were found to slope fairly steeply from the left towards the right wall. Two excavations were made, the larger at the right side of the entrance to the cave proper and the other some 30 yards (27 m.) to the right of the first. It was found that, in the</page><page sequence="3">88 left-hand wall of Area I, bed-rock was reached at a depth of 5 feet (1.5 m.), but this depth rapidly increased to the right of this, and in the second excavation a total depth of more than 13 feet (4 m.) of deposit was found. Fossil bone occurred, exhibiting varying degrees of preservation. In some instances lime percolating through the deposits had covered the bones and stone with a hard calcareous " skin ". The surface deposit, a fine grey dust, yielded sherds and some beads indicating a Bantu occupation of the caves in fairly recent times. This evidence confirms the tradition among the present-day Bisa and Lala inhabitants that the caves were used as refuges during the Bemba and Ngoni raids of the last century. It is this occupation which no doubt blackened the roof and much of the walls of the main cave and so obscured many of the paintings. At this time also iron smelting was practised in the outer part of the cave, and numerous fragments of iron ore and a semi-vitreous iron slag, pieces of broken clay from a furnace and tuyeres were recovered. In the second excavation this Bantu occupation level was effectively separated from the underlying deposits by a layer of artificially placed quartzite slabs at the 3-foot (1 m.) level. The evidence of the beads suggests at the earliest an 18th-century date for the Bantu occupation. PRE-BANTU LEVELS Beneath the Bantu occupation zone occurred a stony black or grey earth with bored stones, polished axes, pottery, bone tools, a microlithic stone industry including also hollow and waisted scrapers, and perhaps a trace of iron. It was at first thought that this layer represented a disturbed zone between the Bantu and the Stone Age deposits; but the fact that in Area II the deposit below the "paving slabs" contained microliths and pottery but no iron slag, while above, the stone industry was entirely absent, suggested that this was not in fact the case, and that there existed here a kind of "chalcolithic industry" which repre- sented the latest development of the Stone Age at this site. The pottery was in the main the same in both occupation layers. This strongly indicates that while these latest Stone Age inhabitants used pottery and perhaps iron, they certainly did not manufacture either, but obtained it perhaps by barter from the contem- porary Bantu population. The potsherds were derived mainly from thin-walled spherical pots and bowls with plain rolled-over rims and no decorations; bowls with comb and impressed decoration round the rim and neck also more rarely occur. The microlithic industry consisted of small but well-made semi-circular and crescent-shaped microliths and, more rarely, pointed forms. There also occurred grindstones, mullers, pestle stones, with pencils and lumps of pigment in quantity. Beneath this layer was found a thickish deposit of reddish-brown earth, more compact than the layers above, and containing a very distinctive industry. The microlithic culture consists of fairly large trapezes, triangles, and semi- circular microliths, presumably used as transverse arrow-heads; rare pointed and double-backed microliths also occur. In addition are found micro-drills, bipolar and micro-disc cores, hollow and strangulated scrapers of Smithfield "N" type, large end- and side-scrapers and choppers in quartz and quartzite, pencils of red</page><page sequence="4">89 and yellow pigment with the grindstones and pestles for grinding this. Grinders and mullers and dimple-scarred anvil stones (some with scars on four faces) are also common, as are also large and small bored stones and reimers, and pecked and polished stone axes and adzes usually of basalt. Bone points of two kinds are found, but pottery is entirely absent. The cultural material does not occur as a consolidated "floor", as it does in the over- and underlying layers,, but is scattered throughout the deposit and is suggestive of intermittent occupation over a longish period. At about 6-7 feet (1.8-2.1 m.) from the surface in Area 1, and at about 11 feet 6 inches (3.4 m.) in Area 2 this reddish-brown earth gave place to a compact black earth, which in places rests on bed-rock and in others on stony, yellow earth, mainly sand with partially broken-down nodules of a softish buff- coloured breccia. This latter deposit contained occasional debitage of Middle Stone Age affinities, and the fact that the brecciated nodules had been partly broken down before the deposition of the black earth suggests that a time interval, possibly of some length, separates the two deposits. This black earth again contained a distinctive industry, comprising very small pointed microliths (some of the smallest I have ever seen), double-backed microliths, both pointed and lenticular in shape, very small bipolar cores, rare small trapeziums and triangles, micro- drills (these being crudely pointed boring tools which have had the points rounded and worn smooth by rotation in use), grindstones, mullers and pestles, pencils of red, some yellow and some black pigment and the grindstones and pestles which have been used for grinding this, anvil stones with dimple-scarring, end-scrapers, crude side-scrapers or trimming stones, choppers and numerous fragments of bored stone both large and small. Bone points also more rarely occur. One flake from a polished axe is also doubtfully ascribed to this horizon, but it is more likely that it belongs to the overlying layer. In the lowest industry the microlithic element was manufactured from crystalline quartz, but in the upper two predominantly in milky quartz. Thus at Nachikufu the cultural succession is as follows, from the base upwards:- Middle Stone Age-A trace (largish and crude). Late Stone Age Industry I-Very small microliths, bored stones, end- and side- scrapers and choppers. Late Stone Age Industry II-Large trapezes, triangles and semi-circular microliths, Smithfield "N" types of seraper, bored stones and polished axes. Late Stone Age Industry III-small lunates, bored stones, polished axes, pottery, and a trace of iron. Bantu-Bisa/Lala. (Present surface.) These Late Stone Age industries differ from the typical Wilton of Rhodesia in the type of microliths, in the quantity of bored stones (nearly 100 specimens in all were recovered from the three layers) in the comparatively large number of polished axes found, in the numbers and form of the pestles and in the Smithfield type of end-, side-, hollow-, and waisted-scrapers. FURTHER EXCAVATIONS AT NSALU AND BIMBE It was obvious that confirmatory evidence of this succession was necessary, and accordingly in the dry season of 1949 further excavations were undertaken at</page><page sequence="5">90 other sites in the Muchinga Escarpment. The first of these was at Nsalu 60 miles (95 km.) south of Nachikufu, where occurs a cave situated some 150 feet (45 m.) up on the north side of the hill and somewhat difficult of access. The walls of this cave, from a height of 18 feet (5.5 m.) or more down to 3 or 4 feet (1 m.) above ground level, are decorated with paintings in a schematic style. The deposits in the floor at Nsalu proved rather disappointing, but nevertheless amply bear out the succession noted at Nachikufu-even though the total depth of deposit was rarely more than 2 feet (60 cm.) and often less. On the surface was a scattering of Bantu occupation; beneath this occurred an industry similar to the third and latest of those at Nachikufu. The second of the Nachikufu industries was found to be completely absent-unless one or two largish microlithic crescents may be taken to indicate its existence here. Immediately below the third industry, there- fore, there occurred the typical very small microliths in crystalline quartz, bored stones, pigment and other material culture of the lowest of the Late Stone Age Nachikufu industries. This rested on a deposit of reddish-brown earth loosely compacted, and with numerous small angular fragments of rock. It contained a Magosian industry, and is thus the first of its kind to be found in a cave site in Northern Rhodesia. In places the rock floor was covered by a thin loosely brecciated deposit of sand and lime; this was sterile. The Nsalu evidence immediately raised the question as to whether the second Nachikufu industry might not be merely a very local development. The answer was found in a small rock shelter at ground level at Bimbe wa Mpalabwe- a large ridge some 30 miles (48 km.) south of Nsalu. At the north end of Bimbe we found several small rock-shelters with a number of rather debased paintings, usually considerably weathered. Excavation in the largest of these shelters yielded in a black earth a stone and pottery using industry identical with the latest at Nachikufu and Nsalu and, underneath and resting on bed-rock, an industry similar to the second at Nachikufu; the microlithic element, grinders and mullers, waisted and strangulated scrapers, polished axes and pigment all occurred, but no bored stones were recovered. The deposit in which this industry occurred was a yellowish-brown earth. DEDUCTIONS This evidence from Nachikufu, Nsalu and Bimbe, when viewed in con- junction with the distribution of surface sites of a similar nature may now, it is considered, be taken to indicate the presence of two, perhaps three, rather distinc- tive industries in North-eastern Rhodesia, during successive stages of the Late Stone Age. The earliest demonstrates the antiquity of the bored stone in these parts. The evidence from the eaves and rock-shelters is confirmed by certain open-station sites (notably on the Copper-belt) where bored stones have been found in situ in a fine grey clay underneath several feet of superficial deposit. Corroborative evidence of a similar nature comes also from the Congo and from Northern Angola. The association of pottery with the latest industry is confirmed by a small dig in a shell-midden at Mpulungu on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. This midden has yielded bored stones, a polished axe, Smithfield " N " type scrapers, microliths and pottery, all in association.</page><page sequence="6">91 The changing nature of the cave-earth in which these characteristic Late Stone Age industries are found may be taken to indicate a change in the prevailing climatic conditions; wet or wetter conditions during the time of the earliest of these deposits; dry or drier conditions during the time the second was accumulated, and wettish conditions again during the time of the latest Stone Age occupation. The latest of these can be identified with the present climatic conditions, the second with a time when the climate was drier than it is to-day, and the first with a time when it was as wet or wetter. This earliest period may be tentatively identified with the Nakurun Wet Phase which lasted from approxi- mately 850 0 B.C. Representative series from each of the three layers at Nachikufu were submitted to Professor C. van Riet Lowe and Dr. L. S. B. Leakey (members of the Standing Committee on Nomenclature set up by the first Pan-African Congress on Prehistory in 1947) when they met in Johannesburg for the Regional Scientific Conference in October last year. Both agreed that the assemblages present new characteristics and have accordingly recommended that a new cultural term be used to describe them. It has therefore been decided to use the term Nachiklufu Culture, called after the type-site, and to distinguish the three industries by the use of the numbers I, II and III from earliest to latest. The Nachikufu sequence shows therefore firstly the introduction of the bored stone; secondly the introduction of the polished axe; thirdly the introduction of the use of pottery and perhaps also iron. The Later Stone Age succession as evidenced in caves and rock shelters in Northern Rhodesia may now, therefore, be given in table form: THE LATER CAVE SEQUENCE IN NORTHERN RHODESIA CAVE OR ROCK SHELTER _ North-Eastern Rhodesia.

Stillbay PAINTINGS In close association with these Nachikufu industries there occur rock paint- ings and some engravings and certain flat surfaces of rock with numerous lenticular grinding grooves. The association of these grinding grooves is now seen to be a very close one, but until we find fiakings from painted walls in the cave deposits themselves or some indication of an "art mobilier", an element of doubt must</page><page sequence="7">92 remain as to whether the paintings could not perhaps be of a later date. The evidence for suggesting that such an association does indeed exist is as follows: numerous pencils and faceted lumps of pigment, as well as a few grindstones and pestle stones, occur in association with all three of the Nachikufu industries. A characteristic form is a small circular, cup-shaped mortar used for grinding haematite. One such was found at Nachikufu at the base of the Nachikufu II layer. A second occurred on a flat projecting piece of rock in the shelter at Bimbe. Here the paintings were all schematic and in red, while immediately below them occurred the mortar-the association is suggestive. At Nachikufu the earliest paintings, which were semi-naturalistic and in black, were some of them only one inch (2.5 cm.) above floor-level, suggesting that when they were painted the floor was considerably lower than it is to-day. At a rock-shelter, situated some 15 to 20 feet (4.5-6 m.) above the Chifubwa Stream at Solwezi, occur painted-engravings, again of a schematic nature. The lower half of these engravings was covered by 7 feet (2 m.) of sterile sand washed or blown into the shelter. Under the sand lay the occupation layer (containing quantities of pigment) which rested on bed- rock.3 A small collection in the Rhodes-Livingstone Museum from this shelter shows without any doubt that the microlithic industry is Nachikufu I. Only one occupation layer (18" to 1' 6" thick) is present, and apparently only one industry (Naehikufu I), resting on bed-rock and covered by sterile sand. This latter also covered the lower five feet of the painted engravings. The great importance of this shelter will be appreciated. The engravings must either be contemporary with the stone industry, or else earlier. The circumstantial evidence that they are con- temporary is very strong. The earliest paintings yet recorded from Northern Rhodesia are naturalistic or semi-naturalistic. Those at Nachikufu are typical. At Nachitalo, near Msofu Mission, the earliest paintings are on a completely protected surface of rock and show representations of antelope. They are equally oxidised with the surface of the rock and are overlain by some schematic paintings. The schematic nature of the art tentatively associated with the later of the Nachikufu industries finds some corroboration from two finds from neighbouring territories. The one is a polished axe with fine geometric engravings from the Congo (possibly also to be included is the " engraved figurine " found with Middle Smithfield-type (sic) side- and end-scrapers near Elisabethville).' The other5 found at Luxilo, in Northern Angola, is a bored stone of schist engraved with geometric motifs, found associated with microlithic bipolar cores and debitage, similar to that found with the earliest Nachikufu industry, on a thin gravel under 5 feet (1.5 m.) of red alluvium. The anthropomorphic engravings on this specimen appear to be reproduced on the walls of the Chifubwa shelter. Finally it is considered significant that the paintings are almost always heavily weathered and, in general physical condition, differ in no essential respects from the rock paintings of the naturalistic art-groups south of the Zambesi. GRINDING PLACES Brief mention must also be made of the associated grinding-places usually near the sides of rivers and streams. Several of such places are known to exist. They are intimately connected with the Nachikufu industries, as several such rocks</page><page sequence="8">93 with lenticular grinding-grooves were found at Nsalu, as well also as one or two portable grindstones bearing identical grooving which occurred within the Nachikufu I layer at this cave. In West Africa they are considered to result from the grinding of polished axes, and I have no doubt that this was also their use in North-eastern Rhodesia.6 There is as yet no evidence that these Nachikufu peoples were anything other than hunters and food-gatherers. The fauna and carbonised fruits from the type-site are all of wild species. Physically we know practically nothing about them. Dr. Wells has examined the few isolated human fragments (notably an ulna), but has said that all that can be inferred from these is that, like many of those from Mumbwa, they belong to a type larger and more robust than the Bush- man. Various Bantu tribes in North-eastern Rhodesia and in Nyasaland have traditions of small-statured hunting people whom they found inhabiting the country on their arrival. SUMMARY To sum up briefly, therefore, from perhaps the earliest half of the first millennium B.C. until recent times the plateau country of North-eastern Rhodesia was inhabited by a Stone Age people who lived by hunting and gathering wild, edible fruits, nuts and roots. Their weapons were the bow and arrow, both with transverse heads of stone and points of bone, the stone-headed knobkerry and later the polished stone axe. Their domestic tools were the weighted digging-stick, grindstones, pestles, heavy scrapers and spokeshaves (suggesting a fairly extensive knowledge of woodworking), bone needles, and polished adzes. Perhaps also the "axe " was sometimes hafted on the working end of a digging-stick as the local Bantu sometimes do to-day. The evidence is also not inconsiderable that these people were at first practising a naturalistic style of rock-painting, which later changed to a schematic art. This latter is thought by some authorities to result from Arabic influence, and one expert has identified one of the motifs at Nachikufu as representing a debased form of the Cufie word for Allah dating to the 12th century A.D. or possibly later.7 ORIGINS AND ASSOCIATIONS What are the origins and associations of this culture? It seems possible that the scrapers and choppers could be developed from a Sangoan tradition-a developing complex found universally in Rhodesia during the Last Pluvial-but for the rest we must look elsewhere. Surface collections from Northern Angola and the Katanga Province of the Congo have yielded elements of a similar stone culture, notably the Smithfield " N " types of scraper, the bored stone, the polished axe, and a microlithic element.8 In this region there also exists the same schematic art style.9 The Smithfield "N " scraper form occurs also in French Equatorial Africa,10 and again in French Guinea," and the Southern Sahara,12 and the Gold Coast." With the exception of the first, these areas and Nigeria13a have also vielded (besides pottery) quantities of polished axes, and the grinding-places where they were manufactured, together with the microlithic tranchets and transverse arrow-heads, such a characteristic feature of the Nachikufu II industries. It is</page><page sequence="9">94 worthy of note also that Shaw, after examining pottery of Schofield's R.I. type and that from Mumbwa, considered that it resembled pottery from the microlithic occupation level at Abetifi in the Gold Coast. The Abetifi shelter (Bosumpra) also yielded a number of small discs and a micro-drill similar to those found with the Nachikufan. In this equatorial area the digging-stick weight, except in the Katanga, appears to be rare, though two are recorded by Fagg from the Rop Shelter.13b The biconically pierced stones of quartz (perhaps used as an early form of currency) must not be confused with the !kwe stone, nor must the mace- heads which occur in the north-eastern part of the Congo Basin. In the Southern Kavirondo district of Kenya, west of the eastern Rift, Leakey and Owen recovered an industry (associated with skeletal remains) in a rock-shelter at Nyarindi, which they have termed Kavirondo Smithfield. Dr. Leakey informs me that it comprises anvil-stones, pestles and grindstones, bored stones and a crude Smnithfield-type industry: it is possible also that microliths are associated.'4 The crude microlithic industries found by O'Brien in rock-shelters at Nsonrezi and Walasi Hill in Uganda, and termed by him "Wilton-Neolithic A" and "B " respectively, may in fact prove to be related to this general com- plex.'5 The microliths, small discs and crude scraping-tools all occur, and some of the pottery appears to resemble forms from further west. MORE DISTANT COMPARISONS We might perhaps seek further north in our search for cultural parallels, and point to the similarities which exist between the Nachikufan and the Meso- lithic culture of Early Khartoum,16 and also the later Neolithic Culture of Jebel Moya,17 both in the Sudan. The semi-circular microliths and tranchets, grooved stones, crude scrapers, grinders and pestle-stones of both, and some of the polished axe forms, bored stones and stone drills of Jebel Moya, compare well typologically with those from Nachikufu and the western Equatorial zone. The occupation of the Jebel Mloya site dated from 1000 B.C. to 550 B.C., and may in fact have been contemporary with the earlier occupation of the Nachikufu Caves and associated sites. The polished stone rings of the Sudan sites have not yet been found at Nachikufu, but it must be remembered that they occur in the South African Smithfield and also with the Wilton. A bone palette was found at Nachikufu. Lest it should be considered that a comparison with cultures so far to the north is too tenuous to be of value to us here, I would point out that it should also be remembered that the bone harpoons and spear-heads which formed the outstanding feature of Early Khartoum are repeated on Neolithic sites in the Southern Sahara,18 and again on sites as far south as the Albert National Park.'9 It is of interest also that, whenever human remains have been found in association with cultures and industries of this western Equatorial type, they have always exhibited negroid characteristics. This comparison has shown, therefore, that there is a similarity of culture at this period throughout the western Equatorial zone; a deduction based not merely on a few isolated products, but on the general cultural make-up as a whole.</page><page sequence="10">95 It must, however, be emphasised that no detailed comparison between the Nachikufan and any of these industries and cultures from the western Equaforial zone and further north can be attempted or justified at this stage of our knowledge, but from the evidence that has been given above, it is abundantly clear that the roots and general associations of the Nachikufan lie further to the north-west in the Equatorial region of the Congo Basin and very much less to the eastern side of the continent. Particularly is this the case with the Nachikufan II and III, though rather less so with the Nachikufan I, which may have had a different origin to the industries which succeeded it. The differences between the Nachikufan and the known forms of the Wilton from East down to South Africa are quite clear. The Wilton appears to be confined more to East Africa, and more locally in our own region to North-western Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia (in particular to Matabeleland), perhaps the Transvaal, and the Cape. SOUTH AND EAST AFRICAN PARALLELS From North and West Africa we may now turn to South and East Africa in our search for comparable forms. Nyasaland is still very much a closed book, but the microlithic industries there and the schematic rock-shelter art closely resemble that from the Northern Rhodesia Plateau east of the Luangwa, while the bored stones are of the same types as occur with the Nachikufan.20 A similar schematic art style is found in the Tete district of Portuguese East Africa north of the Zambesi,21 but as yet we know nothing of the Late Stone Age cultures there. Similarly, nothing is known from the country east of Lake Nyasa, between the Lake and the Indian.Ocean, though recently dos Santos has published a painted frieze from Namapa in the Nyasa Province which shows affinities with the semi- naturalistic and schematic art-groups in North-eastern Rhodesia. In North-western Rhodesia the occasional presence of a waisted scraper, or microlithic triangle or trapeze, suggests influence from further north, and this is the case also in Matabeleland; the Late Stone Age culture in this region is however essentially Wilton. In Mashonaland a somewhat different state of affairs is found to exist. Robinson's excavations in rock-shelters in the Wedza area,22 the late Mrs. Martin's dig at Nyazongo,23 the late C. N. de C. Peele's dig at Alexandra Farm near Ruzawe,24 and many surface collections have shown that, while the Late Stone Age industries must be considered as basically of Wilton form, yet they show very important divergences from the forms found in Matabeleland. As early as 1934 Goodwin25 had pointed out the possible connection between certain elements of the Smithfield "N " culture of the Union, and the material recovered since then has shown that his inference of possible connections was justified. OPEN-SITES Some open-station sites occur, and these may perhaps be earlier than the culture in the rock-shelters. The chief features of the open-station sites are numbers of fairly large hollow, waisted and strangulated scrapers, associated at Glendale with a microlithic element.26 In rock-shelters notably those near Wedza, on Echo Farm, Nyazongo, Mtoko, etc., the industries are smaller, but exactly the</page><page sequence="11">96 same types of hollow and strangulated scrapers occur (I noted only one doubtful hollow scraper in the Nyazongo assemblages), associated with polished axes of Nachikufan form, diminutive bipolar cores, thumbnail scrapers, microliths, usually crescents and lunates, but not infrequently small trapeziums, triangles and half- moons, and rarely, also, bored stones. Also (and I do not think this is generally known) there occur double-crescents of Cape Wilton form, and numbers of what have been called crescent-scrapers, which are associated elsewhere with the Smithfield " C ". From shelter D at Matimwa south of Marandellas, Robinson found a piece of dolerite, with engraved lines such as also occur on some Smithfield sites. It should in passing be noted that the double-crescent scrapers do occur at Nachikufu, but are rare. In fact, if it were not for the microlithic crescents and the number of Smithfield " N " forms, these industries from the rock-shelters of eastern Mashonaland (Nyazongo excepted) could equally well belong to the Smithfield "' C '27 as to the Wilton complex. The Glendale and McKay Farm material is much more closely associated with the Natal Smithfield described by Goodwin28 and later by Lowe,29 the latter g-ing a list of tool types. The polished axe appears certainly to be more common in Mashonaland than it is in Matabeleland; both Father Stapleton80 and Goodwin81 have described a number of specimens, and the majority of these, as also those from Nyazongo, show the general sub-rectangular shape of the typical Nachikufan form. The choppers from Nyazongo are another possible link with the Nachikufan, as are also certain forms of circular mortar, the dimple-scarred anvil stone and the extensive use of the bipolar technique. The apparent rarity of the bored stone is, however, significant. NATAL PARALLELS In Natal the characteristic variant of the Smithfield culture there exhibits the same forms of hollow, waisted and strangulated scrapers, the bipolar technique with its typical cores and dimple-scarred anvil-stones is common,32 while Lowe has recently drawn attention to the association of two polished axes with Smithfield " N " industries.33 Obviously, therefore, excavation of one of these Natal Smithfield sites is much to be desired. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS From the above brief review it is apparent that there are distinct typo- logical similarities between the Nachikufan II and III industries and the Late Stone Age industries of Eastern Mashonaland and again with those in Natal. The associations of the Nachikufan I are more difficult to determine, and it would seem that we may have here an early element (Nachikufan I) with very small microliths, bored stones, etc., giving place to a totally distinct microlithic industry (Nachikufan II) with polished axes, but without the bored stone-except where locally this was taken over by the newcomers. We have three alternatives, therefore, to explain this similarity of types in such widely separated areas as West Africa, North-eastern Rhodesia, Mashonaland and Natal. Either they result from the parallel development of basically similar culture-complexes, influenced by the same ecological conditions; or they are the result of the diffusion of certain ideas and elements of a material culture developed</page><page sequence="12">97 further north; or they are the result of a direct migration of peoples bringing with them a new material culture. Much more evidence is required before we can determine which of those alternatives is the correct one. The evidence that we have at present slightly favours, I consider, the second or third alternatives rather than the first. It would be very tempting to point to a migration during Late Stone Age times of peoples from the Congo Basin area, both northward and southward. South from the Katanga to North-eastern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, thence down the high country, across the Zambesi Valley into eastern Mashonaland, and thence down the coastal plain of Mozambique into Natal. Is it possible also to see in the earliest of the Nachikufan industries evidence of an earlier diffusion from the north (moving, in the main, west of the Zambesi down into the Orange Free State), bringing into that area a knowledge of the bored stone and engraving, firstly on wood and later on rock? Whether these hypotheses will later be established as facts only future research will show,, but it is claimed that the newly recognised Nachikufan Culture has raised important and intriguing speculations as to the origin of the South African Smithfield Culture, and in particular of that variant known as Smithfield "cN ", confined mainly to Natal.
