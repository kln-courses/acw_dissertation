Richard L. Staadt, International Harvester Co. This paper discusses the basics of heavy diesel truck exterior-noise analysis and reduction. Subjects addressed are noise and its measurement, truck component noise sources and their contribution to overall noise level, analysis methods, and steps required to reduce noise levels. Data from a truck noise analysis and reduction program are presented to illustrate the application of noise control principles. 740003. (SP-387) How Finite Element Methods Improve the Design Cycle. R. L. Davis, Chrysler Corp. This paper points out the features of finite element methods that allow design cycle improvements. One of the most important of these features is that models can be constructed, tested, revised, and retested faster and at less cost in the computer than in the laboratories. This allows evaluation of more proposals and sensitivity studies than might not otherwise be feasible. Another feature is the level of confidence that can be put into the results. An illustration is presented of how finite element methods improve a typical design cycle in the automotive industry. 1974 SA E Transactions 740004. (SP-387) Illustrations of Automotive Finite Ele- ment Models - Statics. Charles S. Davis, Ford Motor Co. This paper, through example, illustrates the use of the finite element method in analyzing automotive compo- nents. NASTRAN, the large-scale, general-purpose digital computer program based on the concept of finite element was used for predicting structural behavior. Each exam- ple is discussed in sufficient detail to describe the general finite element analysis procedure. 740005. (SP-387) Illustrations of Automotive Finite Ele- ment Models - Dynamics. Curtis F. Vail, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper illustrates the use of finite element methods for modeling automotive structures for their dynamic char- acteristics. Several illustrations are given, with the results being compared to test data. One example, the modeling of a vehicle for its dynamic beaming and torsion characteristics, is discussed in sufficient detail to illustrate the steps and resources required for such an analysis. Data preparation, typical finite element models, outline of the analysis, and the display of the data in a movie form are covered. The emphasis here is on the modeling process and test correlation and not on the theoretical aspects. The vehicle used for the illustration is not dressed to a curb weight condition, but for the purpose of this paper does illustrate the modeling process. 1974 SA E Transactions 740006. (SP-387) How Finite Element Methods are Introduced in Large and Small Organizations. E. J. Carl, Structural Dynamics Research Corp.; and W. C. Hamann, Ford Motor Co. Once the need for finite element techniques as a computer-aided design tool is realized, the managers of design, analysis, and production engineering groups are faced with the problem of introducing these techniques within their organizations. This paper discusses a plan for introducing finite element techniques into both large and small organizations where the strategy for implementation will vary according to the size of the organization. Discussion of resources required, including manpower, computer hardware, computer software, and training, are presented. Guidelines will be given for setting budgets, integrating the approach into the product design process, reviewing the state-of-the-art, and planning for continued growth in the area. 1974 SA E Transactions 740008. (SP-387) Future Developments in Structural Analysis. J. E. Thompson, Chrysler Corp. The power and generality of the finite element approach to structural analysis is evident from the literature. However, this very generality demands that the user define his problem to the finite element computer program in great detail and with precision. To extend the use of this method within industry and to approach more complex dynamic, nonlinear problems requires new solutions to the problem of generating large, error-free piles of data and improvements in the efficiency of the computer programs and in the flexibility of model description. This paper describes near- and long-term developments aimed at solving these problems. 740009. (SP-388) Basic Solid-State Physics. J. A. Olm- stead, RCA Labs. A basic knowledge of solid-state physics is necessary if intelligent application of its resultant devices is to be achieved. This paper surveys solid-state physics from the user's point of view. The approach is essentially non- mathematical and phenomenological. Analogues are used wherever possible. The survey begins with a brief review of atomic theory. After a model of a single atom is established, combinations which introduce solid bonding, crystallinity, and energy-bond concepts are reviewed. Electrical con- duction is reviewed and the differences between metals, insulators, and semiconductors discussed. The introduc- tion of local defects (impurities) is then studied and the p-n junction established. 1974 SA E Transactions 740010. (SP-388) Discrete Solid-State Devices. J. A. Olmstead, RCA Labs. A fundamental knowledge of solid-state physics is used to gain understanding of the two basic active solid-state devices - bipolar and field-effect transistors. The bipolar 43</page><page sequence="3">740010-740016 transistor is treated as two junctions communicating through a common region (the base). The functions of charge injection and collection are studied and developed to explain the observed static (d-c) volt-ampere charac- teristics. Major bipolar-transistor parameters are then reviewed. Finally, the limitations in gain, voltage, and power are discussed. There are basically two forms of field-effect transistors: the junction field effect transistor (JFET) and the metal oxide semiconductor (MOS). Both forms use a voltage applied to a gate electrode or region to control charge (current) flow between source and drain terminals. This action is studied and used to develop the observed state (d-c) volt-ampere characteristic. The major field-effect transistor parameters are then reviewed. Finally, the limitations in gain, voltage, and power are discussed. Included in the appendixes is a brief review of transistor evolution, which serves as an introduction to device processing information, and an introduction to some of the lesser known solid-state devices. A third appendix explains thermal resistance. 1974 SA E Transactions 740011. (SP-388) Integrated Solid-State Devices. C. Frank Wheatley, Jr., RCA Labs. The field of integrated solid-state technology is most broad. In this paper, hybrid monolithic thin-film and thick-film technologies are discussed with emphasis on monolithic integrated circuits. Processing, component construction, characteristics and limitations of the com- ponents, and pertinent parasitic effects are described and illustrated. Packaging, thermal considerations, reliability, and cost are discussed as well. 1974 SA E Transactions 740012. (SP-388) Linear Monolithic Circuit Techniques. A. J. Leidich, RCA. This paper is a general discussion of the basic circuit design techniques used in monolithic linear integrated circuits. Basic diode and transistor circuit behavior is defined, and basic general purpose circuits characteristic of monolithic designs are analyzed. These circuits include current sources and mirrors, differential amplifiers, d-c level-shift circuits, Darlington gain blocks, and output stages. The discussions are summarized by an analysis of a simplified CA741-type operational amplifier design. 1974 SA E Transactions 740013. (SP-388) Digital Electronics. Dennis Block, RCA. This paper constitutes an introduction to the world of digital electronics and assumes little or no previous knowledge of the subject on the part of the reader. A pragmatic approach is taken in the presentation of the basic building blocks: inverters, gates, flip-flops, etc. Boolean algebra and the mathematics for mapping digital circuits are not treated here. Rather, this paper explores the terminology of digital circuits and the realization of circuit elements in popular digital IC technologies. A table of possible areas of application for digital circuits the automobile is included. 1974 SA E Transactions 740014. (SP-388) Electronic Closed Loop Controls for the Automobile. John F. Cassidy, Jr., Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the application of control system technology to the design of electronic closed loop controls for the automobile. A number of basic theoretical concepts which are pertinent to auto- motive problems are discussed; these include open and closed loop control, step response, time delay, and the proportional-integral controller. These concepts are illus- trated by an analysis of the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio control problem. 1974 SA E Transactions 740015. (SP-388) Sensors, Displays, and Signal Con- ditioning. Robert B. Hood, Fairchild Semicon- ductor. This paper is an introductory survey of sensors, displays, and signal processors of potential value to automotive control designers. The sensors section discusses position sensing, pressure sensing, and temperature sensing. Spe- cific attention in the position sensing portion is given to magnetic (permanent magnet field), magnetic variable reluctance, magnetostrictive, photon coupled, capacitive, and microwave technologies. The pressure sensing section discusses five types of pressure sensor ranging from the compliant diaphragm-inductive pickup sensor used for electronic ignition to the crystal diaphragm-silicon strain gage. Temperature sensing covers resistor (and diode), wire sensor, thermister, and thermocouple types. The interface section discusses general use semicon- ductor signal processor-to-sensor interface components and of single chip subsystem components. The displays and interface elements section covers standard digital displays and the interface elements required to drive them. The paper makes a case for the ultimate success of "combinational components" which are defined as single chip components that combine the sensor and interface circuits. 1974 SA E Transactions 740016. (SP-388) Actuating Devices for Electronic Con- trolled Systems. Frank Berger, Essex Interna- tional, Inc. The output signals from electronic circuits in suggested computerized systems can seldom be used directly to accomplish intended results in a vehicle. It is necessary to introduce a device that must transduce or amplify this signal as instructed by the electronic controls. These devices can be electromechanical, electromagnetic, or electrofluidic in nature. The intent of this paper is to 44</page><page sequence="4">740016-740023 describe these devices and their intended use in a system and to suggest criteria in order to select the proper device for desired results. 740017. (SP-388) Environmental Guidelines for the De- signer of Automotive Electronic Components. O. T. McCarter, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper describes the climatic, dynamic, and elec- tromagnetic environments in which electronic packages must survive at various locations in the automobile. Previously available climatic data is organized to be useful to the designer. New dynamic information that provides power spectral information for various locations on the automobile is presented. The electromagnetic information includes power line transients, voltage regulation, and steady-state noise information. 740018. (SP-388) Electronics and Automotive Engineer- ing. Joseph F. Ziomek, Ford Motor Co. A discussion of the automotive industry's reluctance to implement new electronics applications, this paper ex- amines the basis on which design engineers accept or reject automotive electronics designs. Unless these new designs demonstrate economic or other advantages over designs emanating from traditional technology, they will be rejected. However, there are now several areas of uncontested electronic application: fuel metering, emis- sions/diagnostics, antiskid, radio, headlamp dimmer, and seat interlock. A careful cost effective study of future implementation of electronic systems is recommended. 740019. (SP-388) Electronic Aids to Determine and Diagnose Automobile Health. J. Peter Bartl, AMP, Inc. During the past few years, a combination of political, economic, social, and technological factors have created a new interest in the diagnosis and repair of automobiles. The field received considerable publicity with the intro- duction by Volkswagen in 1972 of a limited diagnostic system. We find that most auto manufacturers today are either considering or planning to introduce similar systems. This presentation will review some of the systems that have been developed and discuss some possible approaches for the future. 740020. (SP-388) Fundamentals of Electronic Fuel Injec- tion. J. Gyorki, The Bendix Corp. Electronic fuel injection of internal combustion engines is an accurate means of preparing the proper air-to-fuel mixture for the individual cylinders under all operating conditions. The precise amount of fuel required by the engine for any given cycle depends directly upon the amount of air ingested during each stroke. Fuel delivery is accurately regulated via a number of sensors located strategically around the engine. These sensors covert physically measurable quantities, such as engine speed and manifold absolute pressure, into pro- portional electrical signals which are processed by an electronic control unit (ECU). The ECU, in turn, is programmed to determine nearly instantaneously the amount of fuel necessary to ensure the highest torque, best fuel economy, and lowest exhaust emissions under the prevailing conditions represented by the input sensor signals. Fuel delivery to each cylinder is controlled by a precision electromagnetic valve (injector) whose on-time is determined by the width of the command pulse generated by the ECU. The information required to calibrate the ECU for a given engine is obtained from characterization studies; the data thus acquired are reduced to a matrix which can be described as a three-dimensional control surface. The basic calibration can be modified to enrich the fuel mixture for cold start, warmup, hot engine restart, and transients by means of the temperature and throttle angle sensors. 740021. (SP-388) Electronic Breakerless Inductive Stor- age Ignition. Howard Weber, Motorola Semi- conductor Products, Inc. To improve engine performance, reduce air pollution, and increase spark plug life, electronic ignition redesign may be necessary. This report covers the advantages and some of the practical limitations that can be involved in electronic breakerless inductive storage ignition design. Basic principles such as dwell control are examined in detail. Specific conclusions regarding Darlington coil- switching transistors and current-limiting vari-dwell igni- tion circuits are drawn. 740022. (SP-388) Electronic Speed Control. William C. Follmer, Philco-Ford Corp. A second generation automotive speed control system using electronic circuits to perform the necessary logic and memory functions is described. Important considerations, such as performance and environmental factors, are discussed in relation to their design implications. Com- ponent function and system operation are covered using generalized circuit concepts. The unique Philco-Ford electronic speed control system is described in detail. 740023. (SP-389) The Program of University Research: Its Objectives, Organization, and Progress to Date. Robert H. Cannon, Jr., U. S. Dept. of Transportation. The U. S. Department of Transportation Program of University Research aims to focus interdisciplinary research on all phases of transportation problems. This involves the work of economists, geographers, dem- ographers, city planners, behavioral scientists, as well as technologists. The very best minds in our universities will be needed to help us understand the complex, critical relationships between transportation and the society it serves. This paper outlines the objectives of the Program 45</page><page sequence="5">740023-740027 and DOT's philosophy in granting contracts to the universities. In contrast to many other programs, in this one the federal government is the sponsor of the research - the "customer" is the transportation commu- nities. Thus, proposals involve a high degree of com- mitment between the universities and their local trans- portation communities. 740024. (SP-389) Mobility of People and Goods in the Urban Environment - A Status Report. Louis J. Pignataro, Kenneth W. Crowley and William R. McShane, Polytechnic Institute of New York. The research in progress under the Polytechnic Institute of New York's contract under the University Research Program of the U. S. Department of Transportation is presented. Some description of the University Research Program itself and of the Polytechnic's structure relative to the contract is first given. This includes student involvement and interdepartment participation. The research is focused in two topic areas in what was proposed as the first year of funding: mobility of the aged and handicapped, and facilitation of urban goods move- ment. Research objectives, current status, and directions are discussed. 740025. (SP-389) A Measurement of Highway-Induced Changes in Land Use, Population Density, and Minority Business Opportunities. Roosevelt Steptoe, Southern University. The impacts of locating and operating highways and other transportation facilities in disadvantaged, minority neigh- borhoods are being assessed in the inquiry that this report is based upon. The major impact areas being investigated are the changes in: land use, population and residential densities, and the growth and development of minority business enterprises. This is a report of a partial inventory of conditions in the study area before the highway; it will be completed for comparison with the data to be assembled for the area after the highway. The partially complete baseline inquiry reveals that the study area has been developed partially in a very piecemeal and haphazard manner. This is evidenced by the existence of large tracts of undeveloped land, a mixture of light industrial and commercial activities with residential neighborhoods, and the fact that a high proportion of the local streets are dead-end and are poorly maintained. The area is low in population density per square mile, the housing is overwhelmingly of the single family type, with about one-third of the housing units in the "substandard" category. These and related data are described and will be used for later comparison in the impact assessment and will provide insights for developing remedial community planning approaches. 740026. (SP-389) Transportation to Fulfill Human Needs in the Rural/Urban Environment. W. Ronald Hudson and C. Michael Walton, The University of Texas at Austin. This paper presents background and initial funding on a multidisciplinary program sponsored by the U. S. De- partment of Transportation, University Research Pro- gram. This program considers transportation problems involving urban and rural travelers and relates to all modes of travel. In several parts of the program, particular emphasis is involved with the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport, one of the largest in the world. Work reported in this paper include: 1. Evaluation transportation problems related to providing essential services to rural and urban dwellers. 2. Study of the effect of interurban transportation systems on the rural environment and the development or demise of the small rural communities. 3. Study of the movement of goods and freight in the Southwest including the impact of the new Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport. 4. Development of methodologies for considering human response to the quality of ride and service in developing criteria for the various transportation modes in both urban and rural areas. 5. Study of human response in developing methods of evaluating possible modal choice decisions in both urban and rural areas. While these are broad program areas which will require two to three years for fruition, preliminary results are reported herein which indicate the potential of multidisciplinary university research. 740027. (SP-389) A Comprehensive Transportation Re- search Program for the Commonwealth of Vir- ginia. John W. Dickey, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.; and A. Robert Kuhl- thau, University of Virginia. The program described in this paper has been initiated through support provided partially by the U. S. Depart- ment of Transportation under its Program of University Research in response to a proposal submitted jointly by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the University of Virginia with the endorsement of various state agencies and of the Secretary for Transportation and Public Safety. The objective of the program is to bring together the talents and interests widely scattered through- out the academic institutions of the state and provide a mechanism for interaction with state officials and agencies directly concerned with transportation and with other problems related to transportation. A Steering Committee has been formed to serve as a focal point for this activity. Membership includes rep- resentatives from the state government, including the Secretary for Transportation and Public Safety, from local and regional groups within the state, and from the academic institutions. The ultimate goal for this Com- mittee is to develop a well-coordinated program of research, study, and demonstrations utilizing the talents and facilities in the state to assure that the state's problems are being explored from the broadest possible 46</page><page sequence="6">740027-740034 viewpoint and that Virginia is keeping abreast of the rapidly changing picture in all fields of transportation. 740028. (SP-389) Interregional Analysis of United States Freight Shipments. Karen R. Polenske, Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology. This paper discusses the United States multiregional input-output model. The model is a flexible technique of analysis that can be used for many different regional economic studies. To illustrate its use, a description is given of the application of the model in an analysis of the regional and industrial interrelationships between the transportation and energy sectors of the American economy. 740029. (SP-389) An Integrated Engineering-Planning Approach to the Preservation, Improvement, and Replacement of Elevated Transportation Struc- tures. Marshall L. Silver, Ted B. Belytschko and Michael Gelick, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. This paper outlines the considerations surrounding the community acceptance of elevated railroad and rapid transit structures, both old and planned for future construction. Covered are such factors as type of neighborhood affected, land use, traffic surveys, urban renewal plans, and environmental considerations. Par- ticular emphasis is placed upon methods of improving existing elevated structures: evaluation of the physical condition and load-carrying ability of the structure, need for structural repairs, and improved analysis techniques. Computer modeling techniques have been applied to these studies. It is shown that through use of these techniques, the transit operator can more accurately plan renewal pro- grams to reflect the community's needs. 740030. New 2.3L Ford OHC Engine for 1974. Edwin A. Hardy, J. W. Fostey and R. A. Sbroglia, Ford Motor Co. A new 4-cyl 2.3L overhead cam engine has been developed for introduction in 1974 Ford Pinto and Mustang vehicles. The reasons for tooling a new engine of this particular size and configuration are both interesting and logical in light of the background explanation. The engine has several original features including a die cast aluminum intake manifold and a unique automated method of setting ignition timing. Highlights of the development program include the intake manifold and the lubrication system. Several durability problems were uncovered during the program and details of the causes and solutions are described. 740031. Alfa-Sud Flat Four Engine. D. Chirico and C. Bossaglia, Alfa Romeo - Alfasud. The new Alfa-Sud engine is a 4-cyl, liquid-cooled "boxer" type layout with a single overhead camshaft for each bank. Discussed in this paper are some of the design approaches used in meeting the criteria of a high- performance, small-displacement engine for a subcompact sports sedan. Bulk reduction during the design stage is outlined, along with results of crankshaft load studies. Serviceability was one of the criteria affecting the design, as is shown by the interesting valve adjustment system. The appendixes contain crankshaft load data and illustrations describing design, assembly, and service features. 740032. Recovery of Corrosion-Resisting Zinc from Junked Automobiles. K. C. Dean, E. G. Valdez and J. W. Sterner, Bureau of Mines, U. S. Dept. of Interior. Zinc galvanized coatings, zinc-rich primer coatings, and zinc die-cast are used in automobiles to combat corrosion. Most of the zinc in an automobile is present as die-cast that is rejected with other nonmagnetic components when the iron is magnetically separated from the shredded automobile, or melts away from the iron if the automobile is incinerated before being compacted into bundles. Such zinc is readily recovered and recycled. If bundled automobiles are melted in iron foundries without prior die-cast removal by melting or hand-stripping, the flue dusts produced contain as much as 35% zinc. A double distillation procedure has been developed to produce a prime western zinc product from such enriched dusts. 740033. Differentially Coated and Other Effective, Eco- nomical Galvanized Sheet Products. Alan C. Preble, National Steel Corp. The need to eliminate underbody corrosion through the use of precoated sheet steel is recognized. New and modified hot dipped galvanized sheet steel products have been developed and tested for automotive applications. Development of practical to produce, one-side coated galvanized continues to be heavily researched and effec- tive, economical galvanized alternates are now available. A new differentially coated grade has been developed and is the least costly to produce product available for solving the problem of one-side underbody corrosion. 740034. Fatigue Properties of Galvanized Steel and Hot Rolled Steel Before and After Exposure to Salt Spray. E. A. Loria and G. W. Bush, National Steel Corp. This paper outlines the advantage of using galvanized steel to protect critical structural members from corrosion. For example, the mean 2 X 106 cycle fatigue strength for 0.070 and 0.085 in thick galvanized steel was approxi- mately 26,000 psi. It was unaffected by exposure to 96 h of salt spray before testing. Comparable fatigue strength for 0.095 in thick hot rolled steel of nearly equivalent chemistry was about 28,000 psi. Exposed to 96 h of salt spray, it dropped to about 25,400 psi. 1974 SA E Transactions 47</page><page sequence="7">740035-740041 740035. Corrosion of HSLA and Mild Steels Beneath Vehicles. R. J. Neville and S. H. Melbourne, Dominion Foundries and Steel Ltd. (Canada). High-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels are being consid- ered as replacements for mild steel for certain vehicle structural parts for weight saving and additional safety. Their corrosion behavior in this environment had not previously been investigated in detail. Vehicles subjected to southern Ontario winters were fitted with samples and used to compare corrosion of HSLA steels and mild steel. Our results indicate that both types of steel undergo uniform corrosion and pitting. The HSLA steels mostly show similar weight loss and were equal to or better than the mild steel from a pitting standpoint. Two of the six HSLA steels tested showed definite susceptibility to crevice corrosion. 740036. Cummins K-Series Engines. J. L. Butler, J. H. Garrett and J. L. Hoch, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. New heavy-duty diesel engines of 6-, 8-, 12-, and 16-cyl rated 75 hp/cyl turbocharged and 100 hp/cyl turbo- charged and aftercooled are being developed. Design and development objectives include maximizing engine du- rability/reliability and use of common parts in all engine models. Fuel consumption, smoke, exhaust gas emissions, and engine noise equal or better than the best current engines within engine configurations readily adaptable to current automotive and construction equipment are also prime considerations. Initial models of the engine series meet the design and development objectives. 740037. Detroit Diesel Allison's Series 92 Engines. D. B. Field and S. J. Hinkle, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the philosophy behind and design features of a new family of high-speed 2-stroke cycle diesels of 270-860 hp, some of the mechanical and performance problems encountered during their devel- opment, and some of the test methods used and the results obtained. The good power-to-weight ratios and growth potential of these 92 in3 (1508 cm3) per cylinder engines make them strong contenders as highway truck, industrial, earthmover, and marine prime movers. 740038. Caterpillar 3400 Series Engines. Edwin J. Kirk and Donald R. Krull, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new family of heavy duty diesel engines, the 3400 series, has been developed by Caterpillar Tractor Co. The family includes in-line 6-cyl, V-8, and V-12 engines covering the 270-750 hp range. Stringent program objectives were established in the areas of durability, reliability, common- ality, flexibility, and serviceability within defined limits of cost and weight. Design, development, and manufacturing planning were closely coordinated to ensure economical manufacturing with high volume tooling. This paper deals with the design, development, and certain aspects of engine applications. 740039. Elasto-Plastic Analysis of Automobile Body Structure by the Finite Element Method. K. Kirioka, Y. Hotta and H. Saji, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Japan). This paper describes an elasto-plastic analysis based on a plastic hinge mechanism with large deformation analysis for the prediction of the collapse load of an automobile body structure. An analysis of a body structure subjected to tensile load of the seat belt is presented. Numerical calculations were made on a body structure subjected to tensile load of the seat belt as regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and then computer-calculated results compared with test results. The calculated result is in good agreement with the experimental one. 740040. Mean Crushing Strength of Closed-Hat Section Members. Y. Ohkubo, T. Akamatsu and K. Shirasawa, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. This paper presents a method for approximately calcu- lating the amount of energy absorption of closed-hat section members subjected to axial loading. The analytical relation by which the static mean crushing load is computed when a closed-hat section member is quasi- statically crushed was obtained by the method of limit analysis in consideration of a rolling action. Experimental verification indicates that this method of analysis is very effective. In order to examine the amount of energy absorption of a member under dynamic crushing load, dynamic crushing tests were performed on the same members, and the correlation between the static and the dynamic mean crushing loads was determined. 1974 SA E Transactions 740041. Effects of Flexible Connections on Body Struc- tural Response. David C. Chang, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The analysis method presented in this paper provides a systems approach to determine the influence of body connection flexibility upon automobile body structural response. In this approach, a baseline finite element model is created to simulate the in-plane response of the passenger compartment of a production car. To bypass the difficulties in analytically predicting the flexibility of body connections, experimentally obtained connection stiffness data for the baseline model are used in the analysis. The influence of the flexibility of the six major body connections on the elastic response of the body structure is evaluated for four representative loading conditions over the full range of connection stiffness. The connection efficiency and the compatibility between connection flexibility and total structural stiffness distribution are discussed from a design viewpoint. The analysis of the baseline model correlates well with results of tests of a production body structure. 1974 SA E Transactions 48</page><page sequence="8">740042-740048 740042. An Investigation of the Noise and Overpressure Generated by the Safety Air Cushion. Robert Hickling, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The results of an experimental study of air cushion noise and overpressure are presented, and methods to reduce these effects are investigated. Free-field studies of inflator noise are made in an open anechoic room, and various silencing devices are tested. Studies are also made of the combined inflator noise and overpressure in a closed passenger compartment. Tests are made for different window openings in the compartment. Results are presented for a new experimental air cushion that draws in air from the passenger compartment as it inflates. Some of the implications of the data with regard to risk criteria for damage to human hearing are discussed. 740043. Lateral (-Gy) Impact Tests with Inflatable Re- straint Systems for Air Force Crew Escape Module Applications. J. T. Shaffer and J. W. Brinkley, Air Force Systems Command. Designers of emergency escape capsules cannot meet current Air Force biodynamic limits describing tolerable impacts encountered during the escape sequence. A major reason for this is the lack of an efficient lateral body support system. The objective of this program was to demonstrate the feasibility of using an inflatable restraint system in crew escape modules for lateral impact protec- tion. Tests were conducted on both dummy and human subjects. Human impact tests using the restraint inflated to 8 psi were conducted up to 15.6 g without reaching a subjective tolerance endpoint. The conclusion was reached that the prototype system would improve lateral impact protection and that it was compatible with the crew escape module recovery sequence. 740044. A Systems Engineering Evaluation of Passive Restraint Systems for Crash-Impact Attenuation in Air Transport Aircraft. D. Hurley Robbins and Richard G. Snyder, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The University of Michigan. Advanced crash-impact protective equipment and tech- niques which have application to crew and passenger crash safety in jet transport aircraft have been evaluated. Thirty-two state-of-the-art concepts have been analyzed from a systems engineering viewpoint with respect to several engineering, psychological, and medical disci- plines. In order to provide a framework to determine the function level of each concept, an event-oriented flow chart of the crash and escape event has been prepared. The 17 events occurring during a crash are included, beginning with system installation and concluding with emergency evacuation of a disabled aircraft. Performance with respect to the events on the flow chart are rated in terms of hazards of system use, maintainability, reliability, human factors, and other technological considerations. 740045. Tests of Current and Experimental Child Re- straint Systems. Richard L. Stalnaker, The University of Michigan. The objective of this study is to investigate the protection potential offered by various production and prototype child restraint systems. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to determine which parameters of child seat performance are relevant to injury prevention. A detailed discussion of these parameters is given in the text. The dynamic performance of 10 child auto-car seats, two harnesses, and three infant restraint systems are discussed. The head excursion, head and chest accel- erations, and overall system performance are presented. 740046. Description of the Volkswagen Restraint Auto- matic (VW-RA) Used in a Fleet Test Program. Ulrich Seiffert, Klaus Oehm and Hannu Paitula, Volks wagenwerk AG (Germany). The paper describes a new passive restraint system, the Volkswagen Restraint Automatic (VW-RA). The system consists of an upper torso belt and an energy-absorbing knee bolster. The operation of the system is automatic as it is attached to the door of the vehicle. The comparison with the three-point belt having a vehicle-sensitive locking retractor and airbag systems shows that the overall performance of the VW-RA is superior to the other systems. A fleet test of 50 vehicles in the United States will determine acceptability to the consumer. 740047. The 1974 Toyota Belt Interlock System. Akihiro Wada, Fumio Sugiura and Kazuo Okamoto, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. Various types of belt systems with emergency locking retractors (ELR) have been developed and evaluated for their efficiency and comfort. The optimum belt system in combination with the starter interlock system is consid- ered to be the three-point belt system with separate lap and shoulder electromagnetic ELR. We have developed a reliable and comfortable OFF-lock type retractor by incorporating a locking release mechanism that will operate when a predetermined length of belt is pulled out. This device is small enough to be embedded in the roof side structure of a vehicle by using narrower webbing (24 mm) and an electrical locking retractor which is smaller than the conventional me- chanical type. The electromagnetic ELR system, combined with a mercury g sensor, was tested and evaluated for locking time, comfort, and injury criteria, as well the strength of the narrow webbing. 740048. Increased Seat Belt Use as a Result of Improved Seat Belt Systems. M. R. Appleby and L. J. Bintz, Automobile Club of Southern California. A study was conducted to discover if the long-term effect of the lap belt reminder system on 1972 cars would be to increase belt-use frequency. Automobile Club of South- ern California employees driving fleet vehicles equipped with specially designed hardware were used to perform the 49</page><page sequence="9">740048-740055 study. Driver lap belt usage was measured with the buzzer and light reminder system disconnected (to determine use rates under normal conditions) and then with it operating (to determine use rates in response to the reminder system). Conclusions are: 1 . Approximately one third of the individuals who did not use lap-belts will become users for the majority of vehicle trips when the reminder system is operative. The reminder system will also increase usage of lap belts by individuals who used them only on occasion. 2. This study could not establish a significant relationship between lap belt use (with and without reminder system) and miles per vehicle trip, trips per day, and test subject demographics. 3. Approximately one half of the individuals will circumvent the reminder system. The majority will manipulate the lap belts, not increasing lap belt use. The minority will disconnect the electrical system. Their subsequent behavior in terms of an increase, no change, or decrease in lap belt use may vary. 740049. A Fleet Operator's Comments on FMVSS 121 Braking System Compatibility. James M. Lewis, United Parcel Service, Inc. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 121 has introduced many new and varied problems for vehicle manufacturers, component manufacturers, and vehicle operators. An area of great concern to vehicle operators, particularly fleets, is the question of compatibility asso- ciated with antilock system intermix, old and new vehicle intermix, and control standardization. This paper discusses the compatibility related prob- lems observed during limited fleet tests and evaluation of FMVSS 121 braking systems. Test data, observations, and possible solutions are presented with emphasis on the need for more extensive investigation in this area to ensure that the goal of FMVSS 121 - increased truck safety - is achieved. 740050. A Laboratory Study of Automatic Transmission Thrust Washer Wear. Ralph McClintock, Re- search Labs., General Motors Corp. The wear and load capacity of automatic transmission thrust washers was investigated in a laboratory study in which flat, steel-backed washers with successive overlays of bronze and lead-tin alloy were rotated against alloyed cast iron surfaces. Test results demonstrated that the thrust washer antiwear quality of a Dexron automatic transmission fluid containing no sperm oil derivative was comparable to that of a sperm oil derivative-containing Dexron automatic transmission fluid, whereas thrust washer load capacity with the nonsperm oil automatic transmission fluid was somewhat higher than that with the sperm oil fluid. Wear was not appreciably affected by additive package concentration or type. Thrust washer load capacity was increased and wear decreased sub- stantially by a reduction in the surface roughness of either the thrust washer or mating cast iron surface. 740051. Automatic Transmission Fluids - Some Aspects on Friction. Edward J. Friihauf, The Lubrizol Corp. Automatic transmission fluids with different additive systems are compared in several bench friction tests and car friction tests. The correlation between car friction tests and bench friction tests is discussed. 740052. Wet Clutch Lining-Lubricant Additive Interac- tions. Roger K. Nibert and Clarence E. Albert- son, Borg-Warner Corp. Lubricant and lubricant additive interactions with clutch linings and lining materials were measured at elevated temperatures. Swelling, weight, and compressibility changes were related to material chemistry and endurance test results. Interactions of specific clutch lining ingre- dient-lubricant additive combinations were identified to help explain why different clutch linings perform better in some lubricants than in others. 740053. Dexron-II Automatic Transmission Fluid Per- formance. M. L. Haviland, R. L. Anderson, E. D. Davison, M. C. Goodwin and R. E. Osborne, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The General Motors Dexron-II automatic transmission fluid specification, issued in August 1973, defines phys- ical, chemical, and performance requirements of a new class of fluids developed to meet increasingly severe service in passenger car and commercial automatic transmissions. Four new tests for determining fluid performance and durability have been developed for the specification. Results from these tests with Dexron-II prototype fluids are compared to those with Dexron fluids. It was found that the prototype fluids are much more oxidation- resistant than typical fluids in the Turbo Hydra-matic oxidation test; a 60% improvement in fluid durability has been realized in the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission cycling test; and Dexron-II prototype fluid friction and wear characteristics are about equivalent to those for Dexron fluids in the high energy, friction characteristics and durability test, and the wear test. Fluid deterioration in the transmission tests was determined from shift times, transmission cleanliness, increases in fluid total acid number and infrared carbonyl absorbance, and the oxygen concentration decrease in the transmission gas. Tests were repeatable, and results correlated with those obtained in service. The application of Dexron-II-quality fluids in hy- draulic equipment and the General Motors gas turbine and rotary engines is reviewed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740055. Transmission Air Breathing Suppressor (TABS) Valve - A Device for Improving Automatic Transmission Fluid Life. E. D. Davison and M. L. Haviland, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. 50</page><page sequence="10">740055-740064 Automatic transmission fluids can oxidize with use, causing marginal transmission performance and eventual transmission malfunction. Periodic fluid changes are presently recommended to alleviate this problem. Fluid oxidation is promoted in current transmissions because they breathe air freely through a vent tube. To reduce fluid oxidation, and thereby improve fluid and transmission durability, a one-way check valve, called the Transmission Air Breathing Suppressor (TABS), was designed to restrict the intake of air into the transmission and to replace the conventional vent tube. The effectiveness of the TABS valve in reducing fluid oxidation was determined in high temperature transmis- sion cycling tests and in taxicab tests. Fluid oxidation results with the TABS valve-equipped transmissions were compared to those with normally vented transmissions. By reducing the amount of oxygen in the transmission gas, the TABS valve nearly eliminated fluid oxidation. With such improvement, fluid change intervals may be ex- tended or eliminated. 1974 SAE Transactions 740056. Steel Cable Bumper Decelerator. William J. Riffe, United States Steel Corp. A new concept in bumper energy absorption is presented in which the longitudinal impact energy is absorbed transverse to the vehicle. A disc brake actuated by steel cables under tension dissipates the energy as frictional heat. The adaptability of the system to various decel- eration rates and/or vehicle weight is presented along with test results. 740057. Painted EPDM for Body Components. S. A. Banks and L. Spenadel, Exxon Chemical Co.; W. G. Pierii and D. F. Kruse, Elastomers Technology Div., Exxon Chemical Co. This paper describes the development of a factory acceptable paintable base EPDM compound and paint technology package meeting automotive company re- quirements for sight shields, end caps, stone deflectors, etc. The development of high stiffness EPDM compounds through the incorporation of glass fiber is also underway. With the addition of 15% wt. glass fiber, it is possible to increase the flexural modulus of the EPDM materials more than threefold. Progress has also been made in the development of color pigmented EPDM systems. The success to date has been achieved largely as a result of extensive ingredient screening studies. 1974 SAE Transactions 740061. The General Motors Hydraulic-Pneumatic En- ergy Absorber Applied to 1974 Bumper Systems. Lamar L. Kerr, Delco Products Div., General Motors Corp. A stipulation of the 1974 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 215 is that no portion of the test vehicle is permitted to contact planes A or B of the test pendulum. Planes A and B are surfaces located, respec- tively, below and above the impact ridge of the federally designed pendulum. One situation in which the bumper could contact plane B, and therefore fail the test, occurs while the bumper and pendulum are separating after impact. The return stroke of the energy absorber can delay bumper- pendulum separation and influence test results. This report presents the technical procedure used to establish energy absorber rebound performance charac- teristics and the modifications made to the General Motors hydraulic-pneumatic design to obtain rebound control on certain 1974 car models. FMVSS 215 also necessitated the application of energy absorbers to the rear bumper systems of most 1974 vehicles. One real world use of the rear bumper is for trailer towing with bumper mounted hitches. Accordingly, tests were conducted and load values on the hitch ball and energy absorbers for various trailer weights, road con- ditions, and speeds are presented. 740062. The Production HELP Bumper: Evolution, Test- ing, and Evaluation. Jack E. Gieck, David A. Weitzenhof, Mark S. Prichard and Floyd M. Smith, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Firestone has now released its production High Energy Level Pneumatic (HELP) bumper system, designed to fit all transit coaches presently made by prime bus manu- facturers; it is also adaptable for retrofit to older coaches. Vehicle tests have demonstrated 6 mph barrier crash capability and 10 mph collisions into pre- 1973 passenger cars with no damage to bus or HELP bumper. Collisions with a 1974 passenger car at speeds to 8.5 mph resulted in no damage to either vehicle. 740063. Linear Impact Sled for Automotive Bumper Testing. P. A. Weiler and J. V. Scrivo, Davidson Rubber Co. A linear impact sled has been set up to develop energy-absorbing bumpers made of urethane foam. The design, development, instrumentation, and use, including advantages and disadvantages, are discussed. The equipment used to impact under high- and low- temperature extremes is also discussed. The sled, while simple, is extremely safe due to numerous built-in interlocks. The equipment can test foam samples, bumpers, or vehicles. Vehicle masses to 5000 lb and velocities to 10 mph are within the machine's capabilities. The methods developed for testing bumpers separate from the vehicle have achieved excellent correlation with testing done on vehicles. 1974 SAE Transactions 740064. Design and Damageability: Persuasion or Regu- lation? Jack E. Martens, Allstate Insurance Co. Designers have the capability to produce damage resistant bumpers - bumpers that can protect automobiles against 51</page><page sequence="11">740064-740070 low-speed collision damage. If design changes are not made in the areas of truck underride, panic brake dip and dive, and the multipurpose vehicle bumper interface, the automotive industry faces further increased federal reg- ulation. Crash tests and real-world experience indicates that improved bumpers are cost-effective and can bring about better loss control. There is a gap that must be eliminated between current car designs and their future repair costs. The alternative could be even more stringent federal regulations. Professional societies and designers can provide the answer through self-policed future designs that recognize both the initial sales appeal of cars and the latent consumer cost of repair when operating automo- biles. 1974 SA E Transactions 740065. Patterns of Automobile Crash Damage. Wayne W. Sorenson, Richard E. Gardner and James Casassa, II, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. An analysis of 15,000 repair estimates written nationwide on 1973 model passenger cars has been completed by State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. Among the findings presented in this paper are the distribution of impact points around the car, distribution of repair cost, repair and replacement frequencies of certain compo- nents, and an analysis of repair cost spending by component assembly. A procedure is described which will monitor the crash damage sustained by new cars through the systematic collection and analysis of insurance company damage repair estimates. In the future, performance comparisons of various model year vehicles will be possible. The availability and limitations of other insurance industry data sources are also discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740066. Tire Roughness - Which Tire Nonuniformities Are Responsible. K. D. Marshall, T. R. Wik, R. F. Miller and R. W. Iden, The B. F. Goodrich Co. A technique has been developed to determine which tire nonuniformities are responsible for tire roughness. The measurement and interpretation of high-speed uniformity and instrumented vehicle data is discussed. The results presented emphasize the necessity of viewing the tire and the vehicle as a dynamically coupled system rather than as two separate and distinct components. 1974 SA E Transactions 740067. The Effect of Tire Construction on Fuel Econ- omy. William Bezbatchenko, The General Tire and Rubber Co. A vehicle test procedure for determining the effect of bias, belted-bias, and radial tires of different designs on constant speed fuel economy was devised. Test results were analyzed on a statistical basis. Results at a 95% confidence level indicate that the use of steel belted radial tires decreases the fuel consumption approximately 6% when compared to bias and belted-bias tires. 740068. Transient Tire Properties. Walter Bergman and Claude Beauregard, Ford Motor Co. This paper identifies and analyzes steady-state and transient tire properties affecting vehicle directional response characteristics. The study is limited to the relationship between lateral force and slip angle. It shows fundamental differences between steady-state and tran- sient properties. Tire transient properties are described by a force-slip angle loop with cornering stiffness and dynamic lateral force offset as parameters. Cornering stiffness is presented as a variable that changes with speed and steer rate. An interrelationship between cornering stiffness and dynamic lateral force offset resulting from the time lag between lateral force and slip angle is shown. Ramp steer techniques for measuring transient tire properties on a road trailer and on an external drum machine are described. A need for transient tire data for computer simulations of vehicle transient steer maneuvers is shown. Subjective evaluations of a vehicle equipped with different tires are described and compared with results of evaluations of 21 foreign and domestic vehicles. The significance to vehicle handling of tires having different characteristics, as determined by subjective evaluations in a lane change maneuver, is shown. Correlation between measurements of tire properties and subjective evaluations may be feasible with additional work utilizing a larger test sample size, improved test devices, and additional test criteria. 740069. Mathematical Model to Simulate Safe Handling of Automobile-Tire Combinations and Driver's Skill Interactions. L. Rinonapoli and R. Ber- gomi, Industrie Pirelli S.p.A. A driver's mathematical model has been developed in an attempt to find a satisfactory simulation of man's sensitivity and reaction to road stimuli. A merely theoretical approach to study the interaction between driver's behavior and car response thus becomes possible, since a 14 degrees of freedom car model is already available, which reproduces car handling on both smooth and bumpy roads. Any car maneuver can now be simulated, irrespective of its hazardousness and no longer neglecting man's behavior. Thus, a mathematical approach to safety problems is possible and advantageous, since it does not require, as does the experimental one, a test driver to simulate the average man's behavior at the limit condition. 740070. Laser Gauge Tire Dimensional Measurement System. Donald G. Anderson and Hal H. Hoffman, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A laser-optical system for measuring tire tread depths for treadwear analysis is described. Other tire dimensional 52</page><page sequence="12">740070-740077 parameters that can be measured include the -outside diameter, section width, and rib or groove runout of the tire. This noncontact measuring system provides indi- vidual rib height information instead of an average groove depth. A cross-sectional profile of the tread can also be generated on an X-Y plotter. A minicomputer is used for both machine control and data acquisition. The programming capability of the minicomputer provides much flexibility in measuring depths on various tread designs and in defining rib heights on worn tires. The system is evaluated in terms of gage accuracy, system repeatability, comparison with hand measurements, and problems encountered with tread geometries and states of tire wear. 740071. Holographic Inspection of Tires. Michael J. Cannazzaro and Fredrick W. Hill, Jr., Proving Ground, General Motors Corp. A method of nondestructively detecting internal anom- alies or void areas in tires can be a valuable tool for tire structural analysis. Such a system has become com- mercially available. This system uses holographic inter- ferometry in conjunction with vacuum stressing to nondestructively inspect tires for internal voids or anom- alies. A holographic nondestructive testing (HNDT) system has been purchased by General Motors Proving Ground and has been utilized by the Tire &amp; Wheel Development Lab. for structural analysis of tires prior to, during, and after testing. The HNDT equipment is described and the process and utility of passenger car tire analysis explained. 740072. The Distributions of Stress Between the Tread and the Road for Freely Rolling Tires. S. A. Lippmann and K. L. Oblizajek, Uniroyal, Inc. This paper outlines the nature of the measuring equipment used in the investigation of tire-road interactions and presents the results of a study of the interfacial stress distributions of a radial-ply, a bias-belted, and a 4-ply bias-angle tire. There is a discussion of tractive ratios and effective coefficients of friction. Distributions of tractive ratios are displayed for all of the conditions treated and for the three types of tires. The paper also covers the changes in stress distri- bution that result from steering and the relation of these alterations to the lateral thrust and self-aligning torque of the tires. 1974 SA E Transactions 740073. Predicting the Tread Wear of Nondriven Front Axle Tires from Laboratory Measurements. K. L. Oblizajek and S. A. Lippmann, Uniroyal, Inc. A method is derived and confirmed for predicting the tread wear configurations of tires positioned on nondriven axles of passenger vehicles. The method is based on laboratory measurements of the interfacial stresses of freely rolling tires and takes account of perturbations in these stresses that occur during the road test procedure. Wear is found to occur primarily at the exit end of the tire-road interface, and the degree of wear is related to the interfacial pressure and slip determining conditions at that location. The steering properties of the tire also enter into the determination. Abrasion resistance of the rubber, temperature, char- acter of the road surface, the test course^ and the procedure all appear in the equations of wear in aggregate as a coefficient. In addition, there are interference effects between adjacent ribs of the tire that are established and taken into account. 740074. Tire Conicity and Ply Steer Effects on Vehicle Performance. Bruce E. Lindenmuth, The Fire- stone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Conicity and ply steer are lateral forces developed by tires whose importance has surfaced with radial tire popularity. Understanding their significance is enhanced by knowing their dependence on measurement and usage parameters and tire construction features. Their effects on vehicle performance are manifested in vehicle pull and vehicle drift or dog tracking. Knowing their individual vehicle performance characteristics offers insight into handling related field-service problems more effectively. 740075. Construction Experience on Aluminum Exper- imental Body. K. F. Glaser and G. E. Johnson, Reynolds Metals Co. This paper compares the construction of an aluminum body with an identical steel body. The design parameters set forth for the steel body governed the overall approach resulting in a realistic comparison between aluminum and steel weight of a body-in-white. The paper discusses specific techniques used in the construction of the aluminum body and outlines areas of difference between aluminum and steel of interest to automotive engineers. 740077. Development of Aluminum Alloys for Body Sheet. W. A. Anderson, R. D. Blackburn and B. S. Shabel, Alcoa Labs., Aluminum Co. of America. A study has been made of the various alloys for body sheet. These include the non-heat-treatable Al-Mg alloys and heat-treatable alloys of the Al-Mg-Si and Al-Cu-Mg types. Tests have shown that each alloy has a different combination of properties with no alloy excelling in all characteristics. At this stage in the development of aluminum body sheet, it would appear that the Al-Cu-Mg alloys 2036 and X5020 should be preferred over other types for general body sheet application. Where Lueder bands can be tolerated, Al-Mg alloys such as 5182 and X5085 offer an advantage of superior formability and are recommended for use as inner stiffening panels and supports. 53</page><page sequence="13">740078-740084 740078. Adhesive Bonding of Aluminum Automotive Body Sheet. J. Dean Minford and E. M. Vader, Aluminum Co. of America. The different response of various aluminum body sheet alloys to adhesive bonding procedures was studied using a variety of adhesive bonding materials. The bond dura- bility performance was evaluated under a variety of weathering conditions where different surface prepara- tions and surface contamination were present. 1974 SAE Transactions 740079. Finishing Considerations for Aluminum Body Sheet Alloys. F. W. Baker and M. K. McGinnis, Alcoa Labs., Aluminum Co. of America. Finishing of aluminum is discussed with emphasis on its compatibility with existing systems employed for the repair, pretreatment, and electropriming of steel auto body components. Included is a comparison of the finishing practices used to repair fabricating damage on steel versus alu- minum components. The need to modify the chemical pretreatment and electrodeposition priming systems presently used for steel bodies is minimal with aluminum or biometallic assem- blies. Initial results from ongoing laboratory finishing studies indicate that no major alterations of either equipment or processing techniques will be required to accommodate aluminum as an auto body material. 740080. Automobile Panel Sweep - Stiffness Analysis. David G. Adams, Chrysler Corp. An empirical and a theoretical analysis is developed and employed to predict the stiffness of doubly curved surfaces such as those found in exterior automotive body panels. The dependent variable stiffness is a function of the independent panel variables which are: 1. Panel principal radii of curvature. 2. Panel chord lengths. 3. Panel thickness. 4. Panel boundary conditions. The empirical analysis based on measurements made on actual automotive panels substantiates the theoretical analysis based on finite-element computer techniques. Finally, the finite-element technique is used to compute the curvatures required for an aluminum panel to maintain the same stiffness as a steel panel. 1974 SA E Transactions 740081. Design Criteria for the Dent Resistance of Auto Body Panels. J. A. DiCello and R. A. George, Chrysler Corp. One solution to the problem of spiraling automotive weights is the substitution of thinner high strength steels or thicker aluminum alloy outer body panels. In doing so the dent resistance of these panels must not be sacrificed. This study investigates the dent resistance of doubly curved rectangular panels in various steels and aluminum alloys. Dent depth on the order of magnitude of the panel thickness was studied. An empirical equation is de- veloped that relates dent resistance to the yield strengths, metal thickness, and panel geometry. 1974 SA E Transactions 740082. Analytical Studies of the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). Clifford C. Chou, Wayne State Univer- sity; and Gerald W. Nyquist, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) in FMVSS 208 for evaluating the potential head injury requires maximization of a mathematical expression, involving the time-average acceleration, by varying the limits (tl5 t2) of the time interval over which the average is calculated. This paper describes the HIC behavior through the analysis of a function of two independent variables tx and t2. The analysis is carried out for any arbitrary accel- eration profile a(t). It is found that maximization requires that a(tļ) = a(t2). Also, for the unique values of q and t2 that maximize HIC, the average acceleration between tj and t2 is 5/3 times the acceleration at q and t2. Illustrative examples are provided by applying this condition to simple pulses. Numerical results are presented in tables and graphs. 1974 SAE Transactions 740083. Evaluation of Head Injury Criteria. Sunder H. Advani, West Virginia University; and Ray- mond P. Owings, Delex Systems Inc. An impact model of the human head characterized by an elastic spherical shell (skull) containing a low modulus core (brain) is studied using experimentally determined geometric, material, and structural properties. Injury criteria represented by skull fracture, brain cavitation, and brain shear deformation are interpreted and investigated in terms of effective acceleration-time thresholds. Contact stresses and durations are identified for head impacts typical in automobile collisions. In addition, selected comparisons of results with experimental data and head severity indices are given. 1974 SAE Transactions 740084. Prediction of Heat Release in a Quiescent Chamber Diesel Engine Allowing for Fuel/ Air Mixing. N. D. Whitehouse, University of Man- chester Institute of Science and Technology (England); and B. K. Sareen, University of Saskatchewan. Early work on heat release in diesel engines has generally been based upon the simple single-zone model which assumes uniform conditions throughout the combustion chamber. The quiescent chamber engine, lacking vigorous air movements, is most dependent upon air entrainment into the fuel sprays and the single-zone model has proved less successful than with other types of engines. A computer program based on a two-zone model using jet mixing has been developed to synthesize a cylinder pressure diagram and the results compared with 54</page><page sequence="14">740084-740090 data from a quiescent chamber engine over a range of conditions including off-design conditions of nozzle hole number and size and air supply. Allowance for the effect of hole size on atomization of the fuel was made, using published data, and good correlation was then obtained. 740085. The Effect of Changes in Design and Operating Conditions on Heat Release in Direct-Injection Diesel Engines. N. D. Whitehouse and E. Clough, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (England); and J. B. Way, University of Bath (England). Heat release data have been obtained from a 5 in bore direct injection diesel engine operating over a range of conditions including off-design conditions, such as run- ning at low air to fuel ratios, using six-hole injector nozzles in place of the standard three-hole nozzles, and reducing compression ratio and thereby swirl ratio at tdc. The paper shows that when operating with adequate utilized air fuel ratios (A/Fs) the experimental heat release data could be correlated with a single zone combustion model and that changing the number of nozzle holes or compression/swirl ratio had little effect on the correlation after the initial period of heat release. At inadequate A/Fs a modification to the model to allow for partial combustion was introduced. This im- proved correlation and enabled reasonable heat release prediction in the cycle synthesis program. Examples are given of heat release and cycle pressure diagrams computed using these models. 740086. Experimental Investigation and Mathematical Presentation of Rate of Heat Release in Diesel Engines Dependent upon Engine Operating Con- ditions. G. Woschni, Institut fur Kolben- maschinen Technical Univ.; and F. Anisits, MAN Augsburg, Agt. GFA. To predict the behavior of diesel engines with altered operating conditions by means of cycle simulation, a knowledge of the rate of heat release is necessary. On a medium-speed diesel engine, experimental investigations were carried out to determine the relationship between the heat release diagram and parameters such as equivalence ratio, charge air pressure, charge air temperature, engine speed, and injection timing. For a mathematical repre- sentation of the results, the actual heat release diagrams are replaced by simplified "Wiebe" heat release diagrams, which have the same beginning and duration of combus- tion; the shape, however, is simplified and chosen so that if they are used for cycle simulations, the calculated values of peak pressure, power output, and fuel consumption are in agreement with the measured data. Such a simplified Wiebe heat release diagram is characterized by four parameters: the beginning and duration of combustion, the Wiebe parameter m, and the equivalence ratio. Empirical correlations are established whereby it is possible to predict variations of these parameters with altered operating conditions. If, for an engine under consideration, the heat release diagram and the rate of injection are known from a measurement for one partic- ular operating point, by means of these correlations it is possible to predict the heat release diagram for any altered operating conditions. 740087. Computer Simulation of Automotive Cooling Systems. Frank G. Tenkel, Chevrolet Engrg. Center, General Motors Corp. Mathematical modeling of conventional automotive type cooling systems has been developed at Chevrolet for vehicle design and evaluation. Solution methods are based on system air and coolant side interrelationships. The computer program utilizes either experimental, analyti- cally derived, or empirically calculated steady-state performance characteristics for system components. Typ- ical examples of application to design problems and parametric studies are included in the presentation. 1974 SA E Transactions 740088. A Rational Approach to Automotive Radiator Systems Design. K. D. Emmenthal and W.-H. Hucho, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany). A method is presented to design the cooling system of an automobile. At first each individual component is characterized separately. This description is supported by experimental data. Then the interaction of all compo- nents is considered by computation. A parameter study is carried out showing the way to a low cost design. Finally, a criterion is deduced by which different matrix designs can be rated quickly. 740089. Optimization of Vehicle Cooling Systems. C. J. Davenport and R. A. Beard, Associated Engi- neering Developments Ltd.; and P. A. J. Scott, COVRAD Ltd. This paper describes an approach to vehicle cooling system design which combines experimental work on installation characteristics with a predictive technique for the isolated heat exchanger performance in an opti- mization procedure, whereby the cooling matrix may be matched to the installation, according to chosen value criteria. The installation system characteristic is evaluated using calibrated gauzes of varying resistance in place of the vehicle cooling matrix. Airflows through the gauzes are measured for various vehicle operating conditions. Examples of such measurements are given for a wide variety of passenger cars. A simple mathematical model of a vehicle cooling system is proposed by which the predominant system behavior can be interpreted. The measured examples are discussed in terms of this model. 740090. Extension and Application of Oxidation aud Oxide Spallation Mechanisms to the Selection of Automobile Emission Control Hardware. John 55</page><page sequence="15">740090-740095 K. Tien, Mahendra K. Malu and Jeffrey M. Davidson, Henry Krumb School of Mines, Columbia Univ.; and Norman A. Gjostein, Ford Motor Co. The basic principles of oxidation and oxide spallation are extended in order that the cyclic oxidation behavior of constitutionally complex alloys can be predicted with minimal experimental input. The analytical predictions are applied to many ferritic stainless steels, austenitic stainless steels, and nickel-base alloys, and are found to be in qualitative agreement with experimental results. Based on the extended principles of oxidation and oxide spallation, general guidelines are developed for the selection of cyclic, oxide spallation resistant alloys. These guidelines are used to rank alloys according to their potentials as automobile emission control exhaust mate- rials. 740091. An Evaluation of Alloys and Coatings for Use in Automobile Thermal Reactors. Charles P. Blank- enship and Robert E. Oldrieve, NASA Lewis Research Center, NASA. Several candidate alloys and coatings were evaluated for use in automobile thermal reactors. Full-size reactors of the candidate materials were analyzed in cyclic engine dynamometer tests with peak temperature of 1900° F (1040°C). Two developmental ferritic iron alloys - GE1541 and NASA-18T - exhibited the best overall performance lasting at least 60% of the life of the test engine. Four of the alloys evaluated warrant consideration for reactor use. They include GEI 541, Armco 18 SR, NASA-18T, and Inconel 601. None of the commercial coating substrate combinations evaluated warrant con- sideration for reactor use. 1974 SA E Transactions 740092. Corrosion Performance of Austenitic and Ferritic Alloys in Automobile Exhaust Train Environ? ments. H. T. Michels, International Nickel Co., Inc. The performance of several commercial austenitic and ferritic alloys has been evaluated from 1300-2000° F in cyclic air + 10% water vapor and a gasoline engine exhaust gas from 1300-1 800° F. The engine exhaust environment was found to be the most aggressive. This was attributed to the gas having passed over the specimens at a relatively high velocity (20-30 ft/s). The significance of undescaled and descaled weight losses, metal loss, depth of internal attack, and total depth of damage is discussed, along with visual inspection and microstruc- ture. It was concluded that several corrosion parameters must be considered in evaluating an alloy's performance. For the austenitic alloys, a general trend of increasing performance with increasing nickel content was observed. As a class, the austenitic alloys exhibited better behavior than the ferritic alloys, with the exception of 18 SR. This latter alloy was equivalent to alloy 601 in oxidation resistance, but suffered significant edge attack at higher temperatures. 740093. Performance of Heat-Resistant Alloys in Emis- sion-Control Systems. A. Roy, F. A. Hägen and J. M. Corwin, Chrysler Corp. An extensive program has been established to screen and evaluate heat- and corrosion-resistant alloys that may have some potential application in emission-control systems anywhere from the exhaust manifold to the tailpipe. The various phases of this program, which include tests conducted in air and controlled exhaust atmospheres at temperatures between 1300-2200° F are described. Some selected test data and the results of metallo- graphic studies are presented to illustrate how represen- tative alloys react to the various test conditions. The characteristics and functions of the basic emis- sion-control devices are reviewed in light of their effect upon materials requirements. 1974 SA E Transactions 740094. Automatic Braking by Radar. John B. Flannery, AutoStop Corp. Braking system, developed by AutoStop Corp., uses Doppler-generated signals to reduce stopping distance of vehicle in danger of collision. Safety device acts on conventional controls of vehicle, provides backup where driver's reaction time is not adequate, and rapid decel- eration is required to avoid collision. Actuation of controls to achieve deceleration is accomplished by two vacuum bellows, one mechanically linked to the brake pedal, another linked to throttle and accelerator. Braking action is initiated by driver. System discriminates be- tween objects which present danger of collision, and false targets such as traffic in adjacent lanes and signposts. 1974 SA E Transactions 740095. Automotive Radar Brake. William C. Troll, Bendix Corp. An automatic braking system for automotive vehicles is described. The system employs an onboard radar sensor to measure distance and relative closing velocity to obstacles in the vehicle path. This range and range-rate information is processed to generate a control signal which is a measure of the critical braking level existing in the dynamic environment. In response to selected control signal thresholds, the system provides the driver with advance warning of potential collision situations and can subsequently automatically apply vehicle braking if the driver response to the warning is judged inadequate. The critical threshold at which automatic braking is activated is selected to be well beyond that of a normal alert driver, thereby allowing him time to exercise his own options. Problem areas associated with practical implemen- tation of the automatic braking system on the production automobile are discussed. 56</page><page sequence="16">740095-740101 Approaches to the problem of similarly equipped vehicles mutually interfering with each other consider controlled radiation, modulation, and signal processing techniques. All-weather performance is discussed in terms of radar operating frequency and road surface conditions. The problem of false alarming on off-path nonhazardous objects typified by signs, bridges, and other lane traffic is treated with respect to suppressing false alarms while maintaining adequate detectability and performance response on true obstacles. System-driver interface considerations and related human factors are discussed in terms of impact on system design and operational philosophy. 1974 SA E Transactions 740096. A New Kind of Radar for Collision Avoidance. J. Shefer, R. J. Klensch, H. C. Johnson and G. S. Kaplan, RCA Corporation. An experimental automobile radar has been demonstrated which is designed to avoid rear end collisions on highways. A completely passive reflector, mounted on the back of vehicle, returns the second harmonic of the frequency transmitted from the trailing vehicle. The radar is immune to clutter since its receiver is tuned to the second harmonic frequency only. It is also immune to blinding by cars traveling in the opposite direction, as well as to other interference problems inherent in a dense environment. 1974 SA E Transactions 740097. A Vehicle Headway Control System Using Q- Band Primary Radar. A. P. Ives and P. M. Jackson, Joseph Lucas Ltd. This paper deals with some work currently being carried out at the Lucas Group Research Centre into the control of vehicle headway using Q-band primary radar. Earlier work is described in which a "sawtooth" frequency- modulated continuous wave radar system and analog controller were fitted to a Ford Zodiac with automatic transmission and used to investigate the viability of such a system. This is compared with later work in which a miniature radar of improved performance and a digital microprocessor control system are fitted to a Triumph 2.5 PI. The latter approach is enabling several types of control law and radar modulation parameters to be tried so that the overall ability of primary radar systems to cope with varying road conditions can be ascertained. 740098. Proximity Measuring for Use in Collision Detec- tion Systems. Paul Tartaglia, University of Massachusetts. The various methods available for proximity measuring are described and evaluated, resulting in the choice of radar as the best method available. Radar does have its drawbacks, however, and its major liability is the production of a possible health hazard in the form of microwave radiation. Limits imposed by the U.S. gov- ernment are presented and compared to values obtained from a proposed system. 740099. Zinc Phosphate Pretreatment Systems for Alu- minum-Steel Assemblies. Mark A. Kuehner, Amchem Products, Inc. The critical component for maintaining uniform zinc phosphate coatings on aluminum is fluoride. The control of free fluoride is critical to the operation of the process, because aluminum is dissolved in a zinc phosphate bath as a step in the coating reaction. If the dissolved aluminum is not removed from the bath, it will inhibit the formation of coatings on all metals being treated. This paper presents the characteristics and compo- sition of zinc phosphate coatings on aluminum and steel, and lists some practical considerations of the transition from steel to aluminum components. Some possible problems areas discussed are: galvanic corrosion, under- paint quality, surface finish, electropainting, and new paint surfaces. 740100. Priming of Bimetallic Assemblies. F. M. Loop, PPG Industries, Inc. It is often desirable or necessary to use more than one metal type to fabricate a unit in the automotive industry. These bimetal assemblies may present problems with regard to proper initial painting and performance under field conditions. Good painting practices for use with galvanized steel-steel and aluminum-steel assemblies are presented using solvent-type and electrodeposition type primers. Some of the associated problems and their effects are discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740101. The Prevention of Galvanic Corrosion in Bime- tallic Assemblies. Leonard C. Rowe, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. It is difficult to avoid the use of bimetallic assemblies in the manufacture of most products. When these combi- nations of dissimilar metals are exposed to an electrolyte, corrosion of one of the metals can be accelerated; this is referred to as galvanic corrosion. The tendency for it to occur depends on the thermodynamic instability of the metals involved, and the rate at which it occurs depends on the resistance of the system to the corrosion processes. The critical parameters affecting galvanic corrosion are the potential difference between metals, the polarization behavior of the metals in a particular environment, the characteristics of the electrolyte, and the ratio of the cathode to anode areas. Galvanic corrosion can be minimized through good design. Metal combinations that lead to excessive cor- rosion should be avoided. In some cases a metallic coating can be applied to reduce the potential difference between metals or to provide sacrificial protection. If susceptible metal combinations must be used, it is necessary to disrupt the metallic contact by the use of 57</page><page sequence="17">740101-740109 insulators, sealers, coatings, or other nonconductive materials. Equal consideration should be given to fab- rication techniques, methods of joining bimetallic assem- blies, and means for minimizing exposure to corrosive environments. 1974 SAE Transactions 740102. Design and Development of a Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Camshaft. Carl A. Schiele, En- vironmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp.; Stephen F. DeNagel and James E. Bennethum, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The development of a variable valve timing (VVT) camshaft was initiated as a potential means of controlling exhaust emissions from a spark ignition piston engine. This approach was based on the fact that valve overlap influences internal exhaust gas recirculation which in turn affects spark ignition engine emissions and performance. The design, fabrication, bench tests and engine durability tests of a unit incorporating splines to allow the intake cams to move relative to the exhaust cams is discussed. Preliminary test data from a 350 CID (5700 cm3) engine fitted with the VVT camshaft are discussed with regard to durability and emissions. 740104. Optimizing Engine Parameters with Exhaust Gas Recirculation. James J. Gumbleton, Robert A. Bolton and H. Walter Lang, Engrg. Staff, General Motors Corp. In addition to designing and developing hardware to control the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate, it is equally important to tailor the other engine variables. Optimization of air-fuel ratio (A/F) and spark timing is required to achieve the best combination of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) control, while minimizing the losses in fuel economy and drivability. This paper describes an engine dynamometer and vehicle study which defines the relationship between the above parameters. In general, increasing the spark advance with increasing EGR rates will minimize the losses in fuel economy and vehicle drivability while achieving significant reductions in NOx emissions. This approach is limited by a deterioration in HC emisson control. The loss in HC control can be minimized by spark retard, but with a loss in fuel economy. The A/F must be tailored to maintain good combustion for HC emission control without excessive richness and loss of CO emission control. 1974 SAE Transactions 740105. Extension of the Lean Misfire Limit and Reduc- tion of Exhaust Emissions of an SI Engine by Modification of the Ignition and Intake Systems. T. W. Ryan, III, S. S. Lestz and W. E. Meyer, The Pennsylvania State University. The lean misfire limit air-fuel ratio of a spark ignition engine was extended by various modifications of the intake and ignition systems. The effects of long duration spark, extended spark plug gap projections and gap widths, and a vaned collar intake valve are reported. These modifications allowed for reliable operation up to air-fuel ratios of 24:1. The experimental apparatus and procedure used in this study are described. Conclusions are drawn concerning the optimization of the various modifications to extend the lean misfire limit and reduce the exhaust emissions. In general, all modifications extended the lean misfire limit, but increased gap width had the most profound effect. In all cases, the exhaust emissions were reduced by extension of the lean misfire limit. 740106. Development of Interstate Motor Carrier Noise Regulations. William H. Close, Office of Noise Abatement, U.S. Dept. of Trans. Decisions have been made regarding the federal regu- lation of noise generated by motor carrier operations which are subject to the provisions of the Noise Control Act of 1972. This paper presents a brief discussion and analysis of the technical information developed by the interagency task force and public docket, which was made available to the government for development of a regulatory strategy. Substantive research is underway to ascertain the technology and cost involved to significantly lower the engine-related and tire noise generated by trucks. 1974 SAE Transactions 740108. Instruments for Analyzing and Evaluating Au- tomotive Noise. Anthony J. Schneider, B &amp; K Instruments, Inc. A wide variety of frequency analysis instrumentation is available for sound and vibration analysis. But unless the optimum instruments are chosen for each task, the engineer will be bewildered by either insufficient or excessive data. This paper outlines instrument usages that have been standardized upon in the automotive industry. 740109. A Single- Wheel Trailer for Tire Noise Research. Irvin D. Wilken, Robert Hickling and Harold V. Wiknich, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A single-wheel trailer has been designed and built to study the origins of tire noise and its basic characteristics. The single test tire, nominally the 10.00/20 size usually mounted on large trucks and semitrailers, is located 12.2 m (40 ft) behind the rear axle of the towing vehicle to isolate it from other noise sources. Reflective surfaces that could interfere with noise measurements are mini- mized by the high, single-beam construction of the trailer. The towing vehicle is modifed to reduce its noise and wake in the vicinity of the test tire, which can be loaded to 22.2 kN (5000 lb) by dead weights and rolled at expressway speeds. 58</page><page sequence="18">740109-740115 Because of its unusual configuration, the dynamic behavior of the trailer was studied prior to design to help determine several design parameters and show that the trailer would follow well. Extensive stress analyses of the trailer beam and other structural elements were also required. The trailer has been built and operated, and ade- quately overcomes anticipated mechanical problems. A program of research into the mechanisms of tire noise generation which employs this trailer is now under way. 1974 SAE Transactions 740110. Axle Gear Noise Quality Inspection. John J. Bair, William Pickornik, Richard Melkerson and Thomas O'Boyle, Eaton Corp. A gear tester has been developed that can predict the relative level of axle noise in the cab of a truck. This paper documents the development in five parts: establishing the characteristics of noise generated by the axle in the cab of a small gas powered truck, developing a viable gear tester for the noise quality measurement of spiral bevel gear sets, establishing correlation between gear tester ratings and in-truck ratings of axle noise, testing a random sample of gears to determine the population's noise quality distri- bution, and predicting the errors associated with using the gear tester in quality control. 740111. Relationship Between Spark Plugs and Engine- Radiated Electromagnetic Interference. Richard R. Burgett, Richard E. Massoll and Donald R. Van Uum, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. The ignition system of any spark-ignited internal com- bustion engine-powered device is well recognized as a major source of radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI). Spark plug designs can be selected to aid in reducing ignition-related EMI. The effects of various spark plug designs such as resistor spark plugs, inductor spark plugs, and shielded spark plugs upon both EMI and ignition system performance are presented. In addition to studying the effect of spark plug design, the use of the SAE standard (J55 lb) and other EMI measurement techniques to determine effect of spark plug suppression designs are discussed. Generally, the addition of a resistor to the spark plug provides the most effective spark plug suppression. However, other designs may be effective as an addition to the resistor or as a substitute where resistors cannot be practically used. 1974 SAE Transactions 740112. Is There a Best Method to Suppress RFI from Small Engine Ignition? James F. Hoffman and Richard W. Bensman, Champion Spark Plug Co. Increased demand for reduced electromagnetic radiation from small engine operation has necessitated an evalu- ation of the effectiveness of various suppression methods available to the engine manufacturer or end-user. This investigation studied the effectiveness of different sup- pressors in spark plugs, spark plug boots, shielded connectors, and ignition leads. Suppression from resis- tance, inductive resistance, and shielding were evaluated. This work was undertaken on "bread-boarded" ignition systems of the battery coil inductive, magneto, and capacitor discharge types. Results from these were then compared to actual spark ignited engines mounted in lawnmowers, snowmobiles, chain saws, and a motorcycle. 740113. A Report of Some New Developments in RFI Suppression. Norman H. Berry and Peter C. Bertelson, Pyrohm, Inc. The methods of radio frequency interference (RFI) suppression presently widely used in automobiles have operating problems when employed with capacity dis- charge or magneto ignition systems in "off-the-road" types of equipment. Tests have shown that several new methods have been extremely effective with these two types of ignition systems and are compatible with satisfactory engine performance. RFI has been recognized for many years as a considerable source of interference to television, aircraft navigation equipment, mobile-two-way radio installations, and the rapidly expanding use of many new electronically controlled devices requiring a radio signal to operate. This paper describes a series of tests using several suppression devices on snowmobiles, power mowers, chainsaws, and a motorcycle. Although the varied elec- trical characteristics of the ignition system do not affect RFI suppression, the construction details of the engine and the geometry of the cable routing do. 740114. Combustion Bomb Tests of Laser Ignition. Robert Hickling and William R. Smith, Re- search Labs., General Motors Corp. Tests of laser ignition are conducted in a combustion bomb. A range of fuels is investigated comprising isooctane, cyclohexane, n-heptane, n-hexane, clear indo- lene, and No. 1 diesel fuel. The ignition characteristics of laser-induced sparks are compared with sparks generated with a spark plug for different air/fuel ratios. The power density required to produce laser induced sparks is investigated. Although laser ignition appears to be impractical as an ignition device because of its low efficiency and high cost, it presents some interesting possibilities compared to the standard spark plug in that the laser spark is electrodeless and can be positioned anywhere inside the combustion chamber. Its primary use appears to be as a research tool. 1974 SAE Transactions 740115. The Development of United Kingdom Standard Occupant Protection Assessment Test Dummy. Peter Warner, David Ogle Ltd. This paper describes the test dummy specifications being developed as a part of the United Kingdom's Experi- 59</page><page sequence="19">740115-740121 mental Safety Vehicle program. The requirements for the dummy were that it be humanlike in its behavior, be able to produce repeatable results under similar test conditions, be robust and suitable for repeat testing, be economical in use and supply, be built to comply with a performance specification, be easy to adjust and set up for testing, be calibrated against known real-life accident data, and be able to stand upright for pedestrian work. It is intended that the specification will allow users a choice of suppliers and will allow dummy manufacturers to develop and refine dummies further within the scope of the standard specification. This paper describes the details of the specification with regard to the head, neck, shoulders, chest, abdomen, lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur/knee. Testing to date has proved that it is possible to attain practical standards of humanlike performance combined with relative simplicity, robustness, and economy of manufacture. 740116. Anthropometric Golden Shell Models and Their Description by Stereometric Measurements. V. G. Radovich, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and R. E. Herron, Baylor College of Medicine. The Crash Test Dummy Task Force of the Human Factors Engineering Subcommittee (the SAE Automotive Safety Committee) during the 1968 meetings decided to establish master models of seated human body forms, representing the 95th and 50th percentile male and 5th percentile female United States adult size population. A seating posture and basic measurements were adopted for sculpturing of the models which, after being verified by anthropometrists, were reproduced in fiberglass gold- painted shells, thereafter named "golden shells." Dupli- cates of the golden shells were made, having humanlike body construction, for the purpose of establishing the weights and mass distribution of the models. The golden shells were measured stereometrically, which yields a quantification of body shape and size in the form of point coordinates in three dimensional shapes and cross- sectional profiles throughout the body. Thus, the point coordinates constitute a quantitative record of each master model's spatial configuration and the graphical output comprises a set of templates for physically reconstructing or verifying reconstruction of any of the models. The accuracy of stereometric measurements is comparable with the accuracy obtained by conventional methods. The procedures employed in obtaining stereo- metric measurements of the master models and use of these data for extraction of desired information are described in this paper. 740117. Sensitivity Study of Occupant Response in Sim- ulated Crash Environment. Stanley H. Backaitis, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion. The sensitivity of response of crash victim simulation was investigated using a two-dimensional, mathematical eight-mass model. The model was exercised in the forward collision mode in a three-point restraint system using a trapezoidal forcing function. Mass and inertia parameters of the occupant simulation, its setup, and the restraint and environment systems were evaluated individually and as groups, in terms of their effects on the occupant's head and chest acceleration. The study also investigates and rates the effects of shape and time duration of the forcing function upon the response of the occupant. 1974 SAE Transactions 740118. Use of Synthetic Lubricants in Multigrade Motor Oils. L. Imparato, F. Berti and G. Mancini, SN AM Progetti (Italy); and G. Pusateri, AGIP (Italy). The use of several different synthetic lubricants in the formulation of multigrade motor oils is examined from the point of view of their physical and chemical character- istics and their commercial suitability. The influence of synthetic lubricant bases upon some of the performance characteristics of conventional addi- tives has been considered. Engine test results using an SAE 10W/50 oil con- taining an ester base are compared with the performance of a similar SAE grade motor oil based upon mineral oil alone. 1974 SAE Transactions 740120. Synthetic Engine Oils - A New Concept. B. J. Miller, Mobil Oil Co., Ltd. (England); T. W. Rogers and D. B. Smith, Mobil Research and Development Corp.; and W. P. Trautwein, Mobil Oil AG (Germany). A new class of synthetic fluids has been developed with specific physical and chemical properties, which can be used to formulate automotive engine lubricants with a performance range far exceeding that obtainable with conventional mineral-oil-based lubricants. New, unique synthetic engine lubricants are described that provide improved low-temperature fluidity and cold-starting performance, better high-temperature stability and engine cleanliness, outstanding viscosity stability, reduced oil consumption, better oil pressure retention, and reduction of engine wear. The superiority of these new synthetic lubricants is documented with results of evaluations conducted in a wide range of engines and vehicles using standard and newly developed test procedures. Testing under severe rally and field conditions is also discussed. 1974 SAE Transactions 740121. Heavy-Duty Dual-Fuel Diesel Engines for Smoke Reduction in City Bus Service. G. Antonucci and L. Zandoná, Fiat S.p.A. This paper discusses a method of smoke reduction for city buses with diesel engines. A mixed diesel fuel of liquified 60</page><page sequence="20">740121-740128 petroleum gas and the standard fuel, diesel oil, was found to reduce smokiness. Bench tests, vehicle road tests, and actual service tests were carried out. Bench test evalu- ations were made of smokiness, hydrocarbon, N02, and CO emissions. Road tests evaluated exhaust smokiness, performance, fuel consumption, and running cost. Al- though the cost of liquified petroleum gas can be twice that of diesel oil, this increased running cost is virtually offset by the lower engine maintenance costs. The possibility of extending the use of this dual fuel to other types of bus engines is raised. 740122. High-Speed, Multifuel Engine: L9204 FMV. A. G. Urlaub and F. G. Chmela, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG (Germany). The L9204 FMV engine developed by Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG (M.A.N) is an air-cooled, 4-cyl, in-line unit with remarkable multifuel capabilities. With a displacement of 162 in3, it is rated to produce 70 hp at 3800 rpm. The use of the FM combustion system, in addition to conferring multifuel ability, has made it possible also to achieve a high power/weight ratio. This paper presents details of the engine design and operating data, and results of endurance testing are given. 740123. Emissions Study of A Single-Cylinder Diesel Engine. R. P. Wilson, Jr., Arthur D. Little, Inc.; E. B. Muir and F. A. Pellicciotti, White Motors Corp. Exhaust measurements of NO, soot, and hydrocarbons were made on a 2340 cm3 displacement, single-cylinder, diesel engine operated over a range of speed, fuel-air ratio, and timing. Modifications systematically tested include chamber shape (open and divided chamber, prechamber volume ratio, and compression ratio), air swirl, ther- modynamic state of the intake charge (EGR, turbo- charging, water injection, and air temperature), and fuel injection parameters (orifice size, rate of injection, cam shape, pilot injection). Exhaust data suggest that the phenomena of air swirl, fuel spray, and diffusion flames are key elements in diesel combustion behavior. The sensitivity of emissions to time-dependent phenomena such as mixing rates, ignition, heat transfer, and burning rates is apparently connected to the extent to which heat release is delayed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740125. Application of Electro-Optical Techniques in Diesel Engine Research. J. D. Trolinger, H. T. Bentley, A. E. Lennert and R. E. Sowls, ARO, Inc. This paper presents preliminary results of studies of the feasibility of applying electro-optical diagnostic tech- niques to diesel engine research. A 2-cycle, 3-cyl, diesel engine was modified by installing quartz windows in the combustion chamber to provide optical access. Tech- niques investigated include photograph, holography, laser resonance absorption spectroscopy, and laser velocimetry. Droplet formation, breakup, and combustion can be observed in the combustion chamber in three dimensions using holography. The same hologram can be used for particle sizing and flow visualization studies. Formation of certain hydrocarbons can be observed in real time with resonance absorption, using a tunable He-Ne laser. It has been established that laser velocimetry can give com- ponents of air velocity in the combustion chamber of a motored diesel engine. The techniques described are currently being developed for application to diesel engine research and to evaluation of a stratified charge spark ignition engine. 1974 SA E Transactions 740126. Brake Fluid Temperatures Obtained in Alpine Vehicle Trails. I. Burgess, Burmah-Castrol Co. The brake fluid temperatures of three passenger cars were monitored during Alpine vehicle trails in Italy and Switzerland. Comparison of the data obtained with those from similar evaluations in the United States shows that European conditions can make greater high-temperature demands on brake fluid, temperatures above 150°C being frequently experienced. The high-temperature perform- ance requirements of European brake fluids are discussed. 740127. Glycol Ether Brake Fluids. R. G. Brown, Wagner Electric Corp. The primary function of a motor vehicle brake fluid is to provide a means for transmitting pressure from the brake pedal to the wheel cylinder or caliper where the pressure is transformed into the braking effort required. In order to perform this function efficiently, the brake fluid must remain in a liquid state free of gas or air bubbles so that compressibility is not a significant factor. The perform- ance of brake fluid in braking systems in service is a matter of primary interest to brake engineers. The effect of water contamination on conventional glycol ether type brake fluids is discussed and compared with the capabil- ities of water intolerant fluids in conventional braking systems. 1974 SA E Transactions 740128. Performance Characteristics of Silicone Based Brake Fluids. G. R. Browning, General Electric Co. Silicone based brake fluids have demonstrated perform- ance characteristics that are improvements over current brake fluids. They do not absorb water through elasto- meric brake hoses, and their boiling point and low temperature viscosity do not change in service. The tendency toward brake system corrosion and the vapor pressure of silicone brake fluids are minimal. Silicone brake fluids are compatible with brake system compo- nents and will function as an effective brake fluid even when mixed with glycol brake fluids. 61</page><page sequence="21">740129-740133 740129. Engineering Design Benefits of Silicone Brake Fluids. D. R. Chapman, Stauffer Chemical Co. For several years a search has been conducted for improved motor vehicle brake fluids not regulated by present SAE or federal specifications. Safety performance needs are exceeding the present capability of conventional brake fluids, and federal improvement of performance specifications is currently under way to remedy this situation. Silicone-based brake fluids have been the only viable product developed to date. The primary goal of this search has been based on the need to identify a fluid that can be used in any vehicle on the road with no detrimental effects on any component of the braking system. This paper discusses silicone hydraulic brake fluid formulations that are capable of performing this first and most important task. Physical properties of silicone fluids that provide improved safety and per- formance are presented. Such fluids provide cost savings in reduced structural damage and the means for potential cost savings in new safety design capability for warning light systems, brake power boosters, smaller and lighter components, and antiskid, automatic, and wheellock control devices. Silicone brake fluids offer an infinitely superior all-weather, all-climate brake fluid for reduced maintenance and replacement costs. 740130. Silicone Brake Fluids; Friend or Fœ? G. W. Holbrook, E. J. Hobbs and E. R. Jakubczak, Dow Corning Corp. Extensive toxicological studies of polydimenthylsiloxanes, popularly referred to as "silicones," have shown that these materials rank among the least hazardous of all industrial materials. Nonetheless, adoption of silicone brake fluids by only a portion of the automobile industry could result in appreciable environmental imposition, thus posing a potential ecological problem. Considerations such as toxicology, biodegradability, disposal or reuse, and effects on manufacturing personnel and processes are as impor- tant as the more visible performance parameters, and must be resolved satisfactorily. These topics are the subject of this paper. 1974 SAE Transactions 740131. The Economic Effectiveness of Vehicle Inspec- tion/ Maintenance as a Means for Reducing Exhaust Emissions: A Quantitative Appraisal (Report on CRC-APRAC Project CAPE-13-68). Owen P. Hall, Jr. and Neal A. Richardson, TRW, Inc. A program of vehicle inspection and maintenance has emerged as potential strategy for reducing harmful exhaust emissions from automobiles. Of the several short-term approaches now available for controlling vehicular emissions, an inspection program has the capacity for affecting the largest number of vehicles within the population. The purpose of this study is to attempt to characterize the economic effectiveness of a mandatory inspection maintenance program. Results from this analysis will show that under proper conditions an inspection program can serve as a viable component of an emission control strategy. 740132. The Economic Effectiveness of Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance for Reducing Exhaust Emis- sions: A Supporting Experimental Program. J. S. Welstand, Scott Research Labs., Inc.; and C. H. Oki, Systems Group, TRW, Inc. A series of experimental programs was conducted to provide an empirical data base for a computer model of the economic effectiveness of mandatory inspection and maintenance of light-duty vehicles. The experimental programs provided four basic data sets: 1. The frequency and extent of engine maladjustments and component failures of in-use vehicles. 2. The change in exhaust emission levels that results from changes in engine adjustments and component condition. 3. The deterioration of engine adjustments and components and the associated deterioration in exhaust emissions with the accumulation of time and mileage. 4. The ability of automotive service organization to detect and repair engine maladjustments and failures. The data that resulted from these experiments were effectively employed in the computer model. 740133. Idle Emissions Testing - Part II. J. Panzer, Esso Research and Engineering Co. Data from two test fleets, representative of the United States car population, were used to evaluate the relative merits of procedures using idle and short loaded emissions tests to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions. The incidence of engine malfunctions and the effect of each on idle emissions were determined. From this, a diagnostic procedure based on nonloaded testing (idle and 2500 rpm emissions) was developed. Tune-up repairs beyond those indicated by the procedure produced no significant further emissions reduction. The data show that nonloaded emissions testing combined with the nonloaded test diagnostic procedure can be as effective as loaded testing combined with a loaded test diagnostic procedure in reducing emissions both at idle and under load. The study also showed that the nonloaded test diagnostic procedure more correctly identified the malfunctions responsible for cars failing the emissions tests than did the loaded test procedure. In a number of cases, this involved carburetor replacements that did not have to be made for cars to pass idle and loaded emissions tests. Nevertheless, analysis of EPA data suggests that such carburetor replacements would reduce emissions still further. Idle adjustments only (air-fuel mixture, idle speed, basic timing) were capable of repairing 55% of the rejected test cars so that they would pass emissions tests. Further repair of this group pro- duced no significantly additional emissions reduction. 62</page><page sequence="22">740134-740138 740134. Evaluation of Idle Inspection and Maintenance Equipment Network. A. J. Andreatch and J. C. Elston, Dept. of Environmental Protection (New Jersey). In the first year of the nonmandatory phase of New Jersey's idle inspection/maintenance program, over 3 million vehicles were tested in the state's 39 inspection stations. This paper investigates some equipment, pro- cedural, and vehicle-oriented variables that can occur in an on-line system. The relationship of garage types of analyzers to the inspection network is also presented. The inspection equipment is described, and an assessment of its performance with design specifications is made. Operational procedures and manpower constraints are also described with relevancy to mass-production, quality-control applications. A recent proliferation of low-cost, garage-type, infra- red exhaust equipment has made it necessary to evaluate and correlate such equipment to the inspection equip- ment. Special design features are presented, and a comparison of these features is discussed for those analyzers approved by the state of New Jersey. Finally, variables of the inspected vehicle population itself are investigated and compared with New Jersey's inspection standards. The authors conclude that, when taken collectively, inspection testing variables place an upper limit on the rejection rate that can be implemented in an idle inspection/maintenance control strategy. 740135. Lube Effects on Exhaust Gas Oxidation Catalyst Activity. R. A. Bouffard and W. E. Waddey, Esso Research and Engineering Co. The effects of API SE engine oils on the activity of a 1975 prototype monolithic, noble metal oxidation catalyst have been studied in long-term multicylinder laboratory engine tests. Results of this work showed that oil consumption rates, up to 1 qt/1000 miles, and lube ash up to 1.6%, do not significantly affect catalyst activity in 500 h tests, equivalent to 20,000 miles (32,180 km). A commercial type 1% ash SE oil showed only a small effect on catalyst activity in an extended 1250 h test, equivalent to 50,000 miles (80,450 km). At the end of the test, the catalyst met the original 1975 emissions standards of 3.4 g/mile CO and 0.41 g/mile HC. A higher-than-normal phosphorus-containing oil (0.32% P) caused significant loss in catalyst activity after testing for 30,000 miles (48,270 km). This suggests that any need for increased phosphorus-containing additives in future oils could cause catalyst poisoning before 50,000 miles. This work provides added assurance for the compat- ibility of SE oils with oxidation catalysts on 1975 cars. However, reactor-equipped vehicles in actual service undoubtedly will provide a more severe test of the lube effects on catalyst life and durability. 740136. Analysis and Computer Simulation of the Four Elliptical Leaf Spring Tandem Suspension. C. B. Winkler, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The Univ. of Mich. Many commercial vehicle manufacturers are now using computer simulation as an aid in assuring compliance with FMVSS 121. One particularly important aspect of such a simulation is the analysis of the interaxle load transfer during braking due to tandem axle dynamics. In this paper, two analyses of the four spring tandem suspension with short load leveler are presented. One, a simplified model, serves to illustrate the mechanism of interaxle load transfer and to identify the design param- eters which affect this phenomenon. Improved accuracy is obtained by the second model through the inclusion of frictional forces that develop at the points where the leaf springs contact the frame. Comparison of effectiveness test data indicates good agreement between empirical and simulated results when this advanced suspension model is used in conjunction with existing commercial vehicle simulations. 1974 SA E Transactions 740137. The Utilization of a Computer Simulation as an Aid to Predict Compliance with MVSS 121. John W. Gurney, Ford Motor Co.; and James E. Bernard, University of Michigan. Certain sections of Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 121 require that air braked commercial vehicles have the capacity to produce an average deceleration of more than 17 ft/s2 from 60 mph to stop without prolonged wheel lockup on a surface characterized by an ASTM skid number of 75. Since commercial vehicles commonly include a wide variety of geometric and load configu- rations, careful steps must be taken by the manufacturer to assure conformance of each vehicle produced. Ford has found it useful to approach this problem with a program combining vehicle testing and computer simulation. A simple computer model is employed to select critical vehicles for subsequent testing. These vehicles serve a twofold purpose: to demonstrate em- pirically conformance to the stopping distance require- ments of MVSS 121, and to permit correlation of a more sophisticated simulation. This more comprehensive model is then utilized to calculate the longitudinal braking performance of other vehicles. In this paper, some details of the Ford program are given, with particular attention to the testing and simulation of vehicles equipped with antilock braking systems. 1974 SA E Transactions 740138. A Digital Computer Method for the Prediction of the Directional Response of Trucks and Tractor- Trailers. James E. Bernard, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The Univ. of Mich. It has long been recognized by vehicle dynamicists that tire properties are of utmost importance in the deter- 63</page><page sequence="23">740138-740143 mination of vehicle handling. Trucks and tractor-trailers are no exception; thus, to provide a reasonable simulation of commercial vehicle handling, careful attention must be paid to the representation of the mechanics of the tire-road interface. In this paper, a newly developed simulation of commercial vehicles is discussed, with special consideration given to the modeling of the tire-road interface. Comparisons are also presented which show a high degree of correlation between commercial vehicle test data and simulation results for steady turn and braking-in-a-turn maneuvers. 1974 SA E Transactions 740139. A Study of Lengthened Engine Oil-Change Intervals. Loren G. Pless, Research Labs., Gen- eral Motors Corp. Lengthening the engine oil-change interval would reduce the frequency of automotive maintenance, reduce the amount of oil required to service the car population, and reduce the potential pollution problem resulting from the disposal of the used oil. Tests were run using 1967-1972 model United States passenger cars, operating in several types of service. Using unleaded instead of leaded gasoline reduced deposits and wear. With unleaded gasoline, doubling the oil-change interval had no significant effect on deposits and wear, but did increase oil filter plugging frequency. Deposits and wear were less with unleaded gasoline and doubled oil-change interval than with leaded gasoline and "stan- dard" oil-change interval. Doubling the concentration of additives used in current quality oils was more effective at reducing deposits and wear than was doubling the engine crankcase ventilation rate. These studies indicate the feasibilitv of eventually lengthening the engine oil-change interval for General Motors cars provided that only unleaded gasoline and SE or better quality engine oil are used. 1974 SA E Transactions 740140. Anti-Rust Performance of Ash and Ashless Crankcase Oils in Short Trip Service. A. R. Nolf, Shell Canada Ltd.; and R. T. Schlobohm, Shell Development Co. A short-trip rust test was conducted on both ash- containing and ashless oils, using both leaded and nonleaded fuels. Our findings show that ash-containing formulations are greatly superior, particularly during the last phase of this test. When one of the ashless formu- lations was used with nonleaded gasoline, a 3 average lifter rust number improvement was obtained over that found in leaded gasoline. Pushrods and oil pump relief valves, in general, rusted very little, which is contrary to rusting found in Sequence Test IIC. Ash-containing oils allowed spotted patches of rust on the nontraveled areas of the hydraulic lifter plunger while ashless oils allowed an even rust on the total area of the traveled part. New lifters installed at the intermediate inspections had accumulated as much rust by the final inspection as those present from the beginning. This short-trip rust test in comparison to Sequence Test IIC has demonstrated an appreciation of ash-containing oils and a depreciation of ashless oils. 740141. Low Ash Motor Oils - Laboratory and Field. R. D. Robins and W. C. Gergel, The Lubrizol Corp. Three low ash motor oils were compared to a conven- tional SE motor oil. The comparisons were made using the following test methods: laboratory dynamometer, road simulator, and Aunt Minnie short-trip test. The test results demonstrate that it may be possible with present technology to produce a motor oil approaching SE quality having 60-95% lower sulfated ash than most currently marketed SE performance level motor oils. 740142. Automatic Urban Transportation in Britain. Roy C. Baker and Henry W. Groves, Hawker Sid- deley Dynamics, Ltd. For several years the British Government's Transport and Road Research Laboratory has been working on ad- vanced, automatic, urban transportation systems. Further to this in July 1973, the British Government placed its first contracts with industry for studies leading to the devel- opment of these new forms of PRT-like systems. This paper describes the work of one main contract, intended to lead to a public demonstration system in Sheffield. A description is given of the scenario to which this Minitram system must relate, and the organization and institutional situation in Britain is outlined. A brief history of affairs leading to the placing of the contracts, including the Transport and Road Research Laboratory and Hawker Siddeley participation in the Autotaxi and Cabtrack PRT projects, is given. 740143. The Aramis PRT System. Jean P. Maury, MATRA Transportation Div. The Aramis is an intermediate capacity transportation system providing high traffic capacity (up to 15,000 passengers/hour/route) and direct service capacity. De- veloped jointly by MATRA and the Paris Metro Author- ity, the system is expected to be in commercial operation by 1977. The system is made up of autonomous vehicles, each of which has a capacity of 10 seats, runs on four rubber tires, is guided by four lateral wheels, and has a conventional electrical engine. The control system is decentralized at the station level, while a central computer handles the overall deployment of vehicles. An experimental track has been operating near Orly airport. Results to date show that Aramis is a viable solution for intermediate capacity transportation in the Paris suburbs. Studies to date indicate that the cost of the system is competitive with existing subway systems. Details of the economics are given. 64</page><page sequence="24">740144-740153 740144. The Transurban System. Ernst Rieser, Trans- urban Systems Canada Ltd. The design of new urban transportation systems must take many factors into consideration, including passenger comfort and safety, reliability and cost of service, economy of operation and installation, integration with existing modes of transportation, varying capacity re- quirements during peak and off-peak hours, need for low exhaust and noise pollution, and compatability with a city's character. This paper describes one system which tries to meet these requirements, the Transurban system developed by Krauss-Maffei. Use of 12-passenger vehi- cles enables the make up of varying train lengths to meet fluctuating demand up to about 15,000 passengers/h. The vehicles are powered by electromagnets controlled by an electronic system. The system is presently undergoing test and will be installed at the Canadian National Exposition by the end of 1974. 740147. Applications for Flame Sprayed and Plasma Sprayed Coatings in the Automotive Industry. Vincent Meringolo and Frank N. Longo, MET- CO Inc. Some of the many flame sprayed and plasma sprayed coating applications in the automotive industry are outlined, including coatings applied in original manu- facture as well as for salvage and repair. Experimental programs on turbine engine regenerator seal coatings and abradable coatings are discussed in detail. Coatings for the Wankel engine are examined. Many of the coatings being considered for rotor housings, side housings, and seals are reviewed and discussed. 740149. The Influence of Steering and Suspension System Degradation on Vehicle Limit Performance. P. S. Fancher, R. D. Ervin and L. Segel, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The Univ. of Michigan. The influence of degraded steering and suspension components on open-loop vehicle performance at the limits of tire-road frictional coupling is examined in this paper. The major conclusion obtained is that, with the exception of the shock absorber in certain maneuvers, the range of limit performance exhibited by new cars, as derived from design differences, is much larger than the in-use changes in limit performance of individual vehicles deriving from degradation of steering and suspension system components. This result should lead to future studies in which: 1. The influence of steering and suspension system degradation in the nonlimit regime of vehicle operation is examined. 2. Equipment for on-the-vehicle evaluation of sus- pension damping is investigated. 3. Greater emphasis is placed on the degradation of tires and brakes. 740150. The Role of Steering and Suspension Degrada- tions and Failures in Accident Causation. John R. Treat and Kent B. Joscelyn, Institute for Re- search in Public Safety, Indiana Univ. Despite inherent difficulties of assessment, accident investigation can provide useful estimates of the role of steering and suspension degradations and failures in causing accidents; studies conducted by the Indiana University Institute for Research in Public Safety indicate that such factors probably account for no more than about 5% of accidents, and other causation studies record similarly low involvement percentages. However, neither the influence of different original equipment capabilities nor the role of degradations as a source of driver fatigue has been adequately considered. Another group of studies has shown that degradations in steering and suspension components can adversely affect vehicle handling, and that such degradations are common in the vehicle-in-use population. 740151. Passenger Vehicle Brake Faults - Effects on Handling, Prevalence, and Criteria for Detection. E. L. Cline, W. C. Wickersham and Frank W. Hartman, Clayton Manufacturing Co. The results of an investigation of the relationship between course deviation and quantified brake faults are presented in this paper. The development of chassis dynamometer brake testing criteria, correlated with road test and physical inspection results, is discussed. Statistics on the prevalence of in-use vehicle brake system faults are given. The improvements in perception and repeatability ena- bled by computer automation of the dynamometer brake tester are described. 740152. Opto-Electronic Ignition. Eric H. Ford, Lumen- ition Ltd. Since the autumn of 1967, we have been developing ignition systems using opto-electronic bistable triggers which accurately sense engine position at any speed and produce a constant crank angle dwell function in the same way as would a perfect set of cam-operated contacts. To date, over 10,000 of these systems are in use, and many have exceeded 150,000 miles of operation with only spark plug maintenance. This paper explains our preference for the bistable opto-electronic trigger and our reasons for choosing the engineering paths we have taken. 740153. Engine Position Transducers for Electronic Ig- nition. John H. Moore, Joseph Lucas Ltd.; and John Longstaff-Tyrrell, Lucas Electrical Co. Ltd. The function of the position transducer in electronic ignition control is discussed and a desired performance evolved. The transducer characteristics which influence aspects of the performance, and the imposed environmental conditions, both mechanical and electrical, are considered and a specification is proposed. 65</page><page sequence="25">740153-740159 A number of transducer systems at present in use are examined in detail against this specification, and the main features of some alternative types are reviewed. 740154. A Successful Electronic Ignition System thru Fundamental Problem Analysis. Donald W. Carlson and Walter L. Doelp, Jr., Ford Motor Co. For 1974, Ford is providing, as standard equipment, a solid-state ignition system on all 400 CID and 460 CID engines as well as on all California vehicles equipped with 200-351 CID engines. This paper explains the Ford solid-state ignition system and the objectives and design philosophy that was used in the development of the system. Further, a review of the design and production validation test plans is discussed. With this background, specific examples of the effectiveness of complete problem analysis for fundamental cause and corrective action is presented, in addition to control methods and evaluation of corrective action. This problem analysis system allowed this automotive electronic product to go into production with a high degree of confidence in meeting the reliability goals. 740155. Programable Electronic Ignition Equipment for Study of Engine Behavior. M. Cops and P. R. Wentworth, Joseph Lucas Group Research Centre. This paper describes two instruments for electronically controlling ignition timing that were developed for the investigation of ignition timing control surfaces. The first instrument described generates straight-line advance curves with break-points as a function of manifold pressure and engine speed. The second instrument described is more versatile and allows the generation of advance curves that are a general function of two independent variables, one of these being engine speed. Use of the equipment to provide specifications for the design of mechanical distributors and also for the design of more sophisticated types of electronic advance systems is described, and some results are given. 1974 SA E Transactions 740156. Development of the Sierracin Electrically Heat- able Safety Glass Interlayer. B. P. Levin, Sier- racin Corp. A new concept for providing electrically heatable auto- motive safety glass for rapid, silent removal of ice and fog condensation has been developed, based upon continuous deposition of a transparent conductive coating on plastic substrates. This concept is embodied in an electrically heatable interlayer. The technical foundations and an- tecedents of this product are discussed. The major components of the interlayer are described, and the use of the interlayer in subsequent lamination is illustrated, as well as special design features of the interlayer particular to its use in current production automobile windshields and backlites. Generalized system considerations, in- cluding connection to a typical production power source, are described together with a discussion of the relationship among the electrical parameters which characterize the system. Optical characteristics of the conductive coating as they relate to occupant vision and comfort are described. 740157. Electrically Heatable Windshield and Backlite System. P. T. Boaz and J. D. Youngs, Ford Motor Co. A new quick-defrost system for automotive use has been developed as an option for the 1974 T-Bird and Mark IV carlines. It can defrost the heated area of the windshield and backlite with 3.5-5 min under standard test conditions at 0°F. The system, which evolved from aircraft wind- shield technology, employs conductive materials deposited on a transparent plastic sheet. The conductive sheet is then laminated into a conventional automotive glass windshield or backlite sandwich with suitable electrical connectors attached. A summary of the development work required in power sources, power levels, product and process requirements, and quality standards is covered. 740158. Defrosting of Automobile Windshields Using High Light Transmitting ElectroConducting Films. R. D. King, Triplex Safety Glass Co. Ltd. The development of a new high light transmitting electroconducting film for defrosting of car windshields is described. The film, called Hyviz, is deposited on glass by vacuum sputtering and consists of a complex of indium oxide and tin metal. This paper considers the electrical design of windshields, having films with electrical resis- tance between 10 and 20 ß/ square and supply voltages between 30 and 80 V. Data are given on defrosting with a Hyviz windshield at power levels between 0.3 and 1.0 W/in2 (approximately 50-150 W/ft2) showing a defrosting time of about 5 min from 0°F for the higher power level. 740159. A Rotary Engine Test to Evaluate Lubricants for Control of Rotor Deposits. J. J. Rodgers and N. E. Gallopoulos, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. During development of the General Motors rotary engine, the lubricant was recognized as important to its success because certain lubricants produced deposits which tended to stick both side and apex seals. Consequently, it was decided to develop a rotary engine-dynamometer test, using a Mazda engine, which could be used for lubricant evaluation. In an investigation using an SE engine oil with which there was rotary engine experience, engine oper- ating variables and engine modifications were studied until the greatest amount of deposits was obtained in 100 h of testing. The most significant engine modifications were: omission of inner side seals, plugging of half the rotor bearing holes, pinning of oil seals, grinding of end and intermediate housings, and using a separate oil reservoir for the metering pump. 66</page><page sequence="26">740159-740165 Using this 100 h test procedure, three engine oils and five automatic transmission fluids were evaluated. Gen- erally, the automatic transmission fluids controlled de- posits better than the engine oils. No definite advantage was noted for apex seal wear. The performance ranking of lubricants in the dynamometer test was the same as that in car tests. 1974 SA E Transactions 740160. Rotary Engines - A Fuel and Lubricant Com- position Study. Jh du Jeu and B. Brandone, TOTAL, Research Center. In former papers, results of the study of test methods for wear and preignition in the NSU RO 80 engine were given. Conclusions were reached on the effects of the quantity and the viscosity of engine oils, the influence of the apex seal materials, the speed, the load, and the temperatures (coolant and oil). This paper is devoted first to a study of sulfur compounds and lead antiknock additives in the fuel (wear versus sulfur, lead, and scavengers contents), and second to a study of lubricating oils. 740161. Low-Temperature Starting Experiments with a Mazda Rotary Engine. E. A. Brown and J. J. Heithaus, Shell Development Co. A study of the low-temperature cranking and starting characteristics of the Mazda engine is described. Meas- urements were made at around -10°F, using a Mazda R-100 car in a cold room. For these experiments, the seal lubrication system - in which the oil is mixed with the fuel in the carburetor - was separated from the conventional bearing lubrication system. Cranking speed was found to vary inversely with the viscosity of the oil in the sump and to be independent of the viscosity of the seal lubricant. Compression pressure was proportional to cranking speed; oil viscosity had no direct effect on compression pressure, but was important only as it affected cranking speed. A brief investigation was also made of an apparent icing problem which hindered starting of our Mazda engine at low temperatures. The results suggest that water of combustion, produced in the first few cycles of cranking, may freeze and prevent the sealing grid from functioning properly. 740162. Energy Method Synthesis of Torsion Bar-Cam Balance Systems. James E. Ford, Chrysler Corp. A general method of optimizing the design of torsion bar-cam balance systems has been developed and applied to the design of automotive hoods and deck lids. Synthesis rather than analysis is achieved by allowing the design engineer to choose the precise effort curve desired for the customer. This method has been used to provide a new hood balance system for the 1974 full-size Chrysler cars. A user-oriented FORTRAN computer program has been developed which provides the balance solution as tabular results and a plot of the cam follower path. Theoretical work/energy principles are outlined for rotational torsion bar-cam systems and related to the more commonly applied rectilinear work principles. A typical problem solution is included along with the computer program flow chart. 1974 SA E Transactions 740163. Analysis of the Transmission of Engine Vibration to the Body by the Mechanical Impedance Method. Toshio Sakata, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). The route of engine vibration transmission to the vehicle body is regarded in this paper as a tandem system comprising engine mount, cross members and other chassis elements. Therefore, on this premise, vibration characteristics have been analyzed by the mechanical impedance method, and parameters identifying the res- onant frequencies of the powerplant, the spring content, and damping coefficient of mount rubber interfaces have been clarified. The equations and formulas presented in this paper offer solution to the problem of body vibration. 740164. The Measured Influence of Flow Distribution on Regenerator Performance. James A. Kutchey and Howard L. Julien, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The distribution of flow in a gas turbine rotary re- generator can have a significant influence on its per- formance. The results of an experimental study, con- ducted in a full-scale regenerator test facility, demonstrate the effects of measured flow maldistributions on re- generator performance. Test facility plenum modifica- tions on the gas side and a change in the regenerator cover contour on the air side are shown to result in an increase in effectiveness and an improvement in pressure drop characteristics. Comparisons are made between effec- tiveness data and estimates obtained using an analytical model. 1974 SAE Transactions 740165. Lycoming's LTS 101 Engine Design. J. Moore and E. Pease, Lycoming Div., AVCO Corp. This paper shows how the LTS 101 engine - the product of an extensive design and development program - resulted in a powerplant in the 600 shp class. It also gives all the low-cost features contributing to this competitive class. Although the LTS 101 engine was originally designed and considered for helicopter applications, its primary objective was for a low-cost industrial engine that would also comply with aircraft standards. Through the inte- gration of low-cost design concepts, a core engine design which offers remarkable installation flexibility has been created. 67</page><page sequence="27">740166-740173 740166. Variable Compressor Geometry in the Single- Shaft Automotive Turbine Engine. David C. Sheridan, Gary E. Nordenson and Charles A. Amann, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The single-shaft gas turbine engine has been proposed as a reduced-cost alternate to the previously used two-shaft turbine engine for application to passenger cars. The power output characteristics of the fixed-geometry single- shaft engine have been found to create performance difficulties, particularly with respect to standing-start acceleration of the vehicle. A review of the fundamentals responsible for these difficulties leads to the observation that variable compressor geometry can provide relief from this situation. Use of variable inlet guide vanes is identified as the simplest means of gaining this relief. Design factors influencing the susceptibility of the compressor to control by inlet guide vanes are considered. A method by which inlet guide vanes can be used to improve vehicle acceleration, without penalizing fuel consumption, is illustrated. 1974 SA E Transactions 740167. Design of High Heat Release Slinger Combustor with Rapid Acceleration Requirement. Casimir Rogo and Richard L. Trauth, Teledyne CAE. Reliable turbojet engine ignition and rapid acceleration at high combustor heat release rates have recently gained in importance for drone and missile applications. These requirements are imposed due to the necessity to minimize engine size and booster needs. Because of the mission and flight envelope, the combustor must also be capable of high-altitude variable Mach number and windmill starts. Design and development of a 10 lb/s airflow combustor delivering in excess of 12 X 106 Btu/h-ft3-atm (1.22 kW/m3Pa) is described. Pyrotechnic devices are used for ignition and acceleration. Optimized fuel scheduling combined with efficient combustor and fuel slinger characteristics have demonstrated engine start and accel- eration to maximum power in less than 5 s at sea-level conditions. 740168. Using Hydrogen Fuel Cells for Urban Trans- portation. Y. Bréele, Institut Francais du Pétrole. Considerable advances have been made in recent years in the field of hydrogen-air fuel cells, and plans are already being made to use such power generators for urban transportation. This is shown by a study of the possibility of equipping a vehicle of the Renault 4L type with a hydrogen-air cell. This paper describes a detailed study of such an installation. The weight of the power source is acceptable, as are the rates of acceleration. A speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) can be sustained continuously, and an autonomy of between 230 and 560 km (143 and 348 miles) can be attained depending upon the speed of the vehicle, with an effective load of 340 kg (750 lb). Two important obstacles (power source and use of hydrogen) are in the process of being solved by using inexpensive materials and by storing hydrogen by means of hydrides. Thus, the hydrogen-air fuel cell should be a decisive contribution to the use of electric vehicles, and its influence could become even greater if, on a long-term basis, the trend to make intensive use of hydrogen as an energy extension is confirmed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740169. The Design of d-c Commutator Motors for High Performance Electric Vehicles. M. A. Thompson and L. A. Walters, Joseph Lucas Ltd. A study has been made of the design of d-c commutator motors for high performance drives in electric vehicles. Details are given of the power/speed characteristic which the motor must provide, and of the influence on the design of quantities such as motor speed, efficiency, winding details, and weight. An outline is given of a computer program which optimizes the motor design for electric vehicle duty, and an example of a 40 kW traction motor which powers an electric delivery vehicle. 740170. Electrobús - Review of 9000 Miles of City Transit Demonstrations. B. Borisoff, Electrobús. A simple, battery-operated, long life, low maintenance, city transit electric bus has been developed with low pollution and low noise emission features. The Electrobús, built to accommodate 21-31 seated passengers, has been test driven in demonstration service more than 9000 miles in several large cities in the United States and Canada. Performance and power measurements have been taken from demonstrations at several typical urban center city bus service operations. From test results detailed in this paper, it is shown that the electric bus obtains 11.5 miles/gal of fuel compared to 3.5 and 6.0 miles/gal for equivalent sized gasoline and diesel engine buses in similar urban transit service. 740171. Conservation of Petroleum Resources by the Use of Electric Cars. Neville Mapham, Energy De- velopment Associates. The thermal content of a typical grade of crude petroleum is used as the input energy and road load is used as the output energy. Efficiencies in refining, transportation, storage, and conversion to mechanical energy are con- sidered, assuming in all cases the performance expected of equipment installed in the late 1970s. The conclusion is reached that electric propulsion is significantly more efficient than gasoline engine propulsion and can reduce the consumption of petroleum appreciably. 740173. Marketing of the Sunroof Option: From Product Inception to Final Sale. Dale D. Haskin, Chrys- ler Corp. The technical design and development of a new product is only one step in the long chain of events between the time that an unfulfilled customer need has been identified and a product to fulfill that need is finally sold and serviced. This paper attempts to provide the automotive engineer 68</page><page sequence="28">740173-740182 with an overview of the total procedure for marketing a new product - from product inception to final sale. Specifically, this paper analyzes the evolution of the sunroof option at Chrysler Corp. from the earliest recognition of the need for a product to replace declining convertible sales through to the selection of the adver- tising theme used to promote the sunroof. 740174. Development of a Formable Low Carbon Colum- bium Bearing High Strength Hot Rolled Sheet Steel. W. E. Heitmann, R. R. Hilsen, P. L. Manganon and T. E. Moss, Inland Steel Co. The purpose of this paper is to show the approach used by automotive and line pipe steel producers to develop a higher strength sheet steel with improved formability, toughness, and welding characteristics. Also covered are the appropriate stages of steelmaking and hot rolling leading to the development of a columbium-bearing steel with a minimum yield strength of 50 ksi. Typical mechanical properties and forming capabilities are pre- sented, together with a discussion of the strengthening mechanisms and ductility factors utilized to achieve this formable 50 ksi product. 740177. Strain Rate Effects on the Properties of High Strength, Low Alloy Steels. D. A. Chatfield and R. R. Rote, National Steel Corp. New design techniques will require that more be known about the response of metals to various service conditions. This paper discusses experimental work which was done to define the response of several hot worked metals to several deformation rates. The results show that ferrous materials with low alloy contents are very strain rate sensitive under the conditions of testing, regardless of the static strength level. These materials exhibit strength and absorbed-energy increases and uniform elongation losses with strain rate increases. A 6061-T6 aluminum alloy tested for comparison showed no strain rate sensitivity over the range of testing conditions. In a practical sense, ferrous alloys will be stronger at high loading rates than expected from ordinary mechanical property measure- ments. This can be an important advantage when considering dent and crash resistance. 740179. Application of High Strength Steels to Wheel Manufacturing. J. A. Lumm, G. M. Hughes and B. J. Bastian, Kelsey-Hayes Co. Vehicular weight has increased in the last few years, and wheel material must be thicker to maintain adequate wheel performance. But as gage increases, processing problems arise in welding and forming. This means that higher strength materials must be used for fabricating wheels so that material thickness can be held to a minimum. The approach Kelsey-Hayes Co. took is the topic of this paper. Automotive wheel spiders were press formed and fatigue tested, using various grades of high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels. Press performance of non- inclusion shaped steels was poor, but that of inclusion shaped grades was good. Fatigue properties ranged from slightly higher to three times higher than SAE 1012 commercial quality mechanical capped steel. 1974 SAE Transactions 740180. The Forming of Vanadium Bearing HSLA Steels into Automotive Components. B. N. Ferry and E. J. Paliwoda, Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp. The newest grades of hot rolled, high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels, characterized by an ultrafine grain size (ASTM 11-13), exhibit an excellent combination of strength (50,000-80,000 psi yield strength) and ductility. Various formability tests demonstrate that these steels are highly formable in spite of their high strength. Compared to mild steels, plane strain and stretch deformation characteristics of HSLA steels are reduced by only 25-40%. In the drawing mode deformation, HSLA steels perform similarly to mild hot rolled steels. Because of higher strength, the ductility of sheared work-hardened edges is low and sensitive to inclusion shape. When sheared edge deformation is necessary, the cracking tendency can be substantially reduced by converting stringer inclusions into globules. HSLA steels have been formed into various com- ponents on dies originally designed for mild steels, indicating that with somewhat more generous contours the steels can be used effectively for mass production. Current failure limit diagrams are inaccurate for grid analysis of hot rolled steel parts; new diagrams are needed which will reflect strain gradients in the thickness direction. 1974 SAE Transactions 740182. Design and Test Limitations on Reducing NOx in Gas Turbine Combustors. R. A. Breton, T. R. Koblish and R. L. Marshall, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. Analytical estimates of NOx formation as a function of peak flame temperature and residence are potentially useful in the conceptual design studies of combustors for low NOx emissions characteristics. It is apparent that the accuracy of these design studies depends upon the actual flow conditions and the variations of the time and temperature occurring within the combustor relative to the estimates. An experimental program was undertaken to deter- mine the limitations, as imposed by practical combustor and fuel systems designs, on the potential reduction of NOx emissions based on flame temperature and residence time predictions. A premix combustor designed to operate at an equivalence ratio of 0.75 was tested with an ideally mixed gaseous fuel. This produced data demon- strating the lower limits of NOx that might be attained and is compared to analytical model predictions. Further, burner designs incorporating lean equivalence ratios, 69</page><page sequence="29">740182-740188 premixing, and rapid mixing concepts were also tested. The results of the program indicate that the effects of nonuniform partially vaporized fuel-air mixtures as well as restrictive mixing rates attainable in practical combustors severely limit the full attainment of theoretical NOx reductions. 1974 SA E Transactions 740183. The Influence of Flow Path Geometry and Manufacturing Tolerances on Gas Turbine Re- generator Efficiency. M. Kohler, Volkswagen- werk AG. The heat exchanger of a regenerative gas turbine is usually calculated for uniform flow distribution. In practice, however, the flow distribution is not uniform. Non- uniformity of flow is caused by the geometry of the flow path and manufacturing tolerances of the regenerator discs themselves. The consequence is a drop in regenerator efficiency. Cold airflow tests were carried out on a model gas turbine to find optimum flow path geometry and data to calculate the drop in heat exchanger efficiency. The entire test was conducted under true Newton number condi- tions. The efficiency calculation of the heat exchanger based on test results shows that the efficiency drop can be several percent. Suggestions are made as to the shape of the regenerator cover and power turbine diffuser. 740184. Chemical Vapor Deposited Silicon Carbide Tur- bine Rotors. Richard E. Engdahl, Deposits &amp; Composites Inc. In a ceramic gas turbine, the rotor is the component with the most demanding requirements, and its performance limits will determine the turbine operating conditions. Chemical vapor deposited (CVD) silicon carbide (SiC) has been shown to be one of the most promising materials considering strength, creep, oxidation, fabricability, and cost. The CVD process has produced rotors in the desired configuration and test samples with strengths of 100 ksi at 1400°C and peak values of 200 ksi at 1500°C. CVD SiC is a pure material with very low creep rates showing potential for operation to 10,000 h and possibly beyond at 1600°C and 30 ksi compared to 1000 h at 1200°C and 10 ksi for the best silicon nitride (Si3N4) available. Under equal heat flux conditions, the thermal stress generated in CVD SiC is similar to Si3N4, and CVD SiC has superior oxidation resistance to other materials tested. 740185. Low-Cost Turbine Wheel Manufacturing Pro- cesses. V. Strautman, Lycoming Div., Avco Corp. The small gas turbine engine, such as Avco Lycoming's LTS 101, has many intended applications. Use of improved materials and processes, which minimize labor input and material costs while maintaining standards of reliability and performance, makes it possible to meet customer requirements and acceptance for intended application. In the turbine section, the turbine wheels offer an opportunity to effectively combine reliability, performance, and cost-saving techniques. This paper describes the various process approaches used in manufacturing LTS 101 turbine wheels which proved to be successful in achieving these goals. 740186. Predicting the Emissions and Performance Char- acteristics of a Wankel Engine. Guido Danieli, Colin Ferguson, John B. Heywood and James C. Keck, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A performance model of a Wankel engine is developed which performs a leakage mass balance, accounts for heat transfer and flame quenching, and predicts the mass fraction burned as a function of chamber pressure. Experiments were performed on a production Wankel engine to obtain chamber pressure-time diagrams, and engine performance and emissions data. Model predic- tions of mass burnt, global heat transfer, and hydrocarbon emission gave good agreement with measurements. Pre- dictions of NOx are high, especially at low loads. This is thought to be due to the adiabatic core gas assumption in the model. The need for a Wankel boundary layer study is identified. 1974 SA E Transactions 740187. Emission Control with Lean Operation Using Hydrogen-Supplemented Fuel. R. F. Stebar and F. B. Parks, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Hydrogen-supplemented fuel was investigated as a means of extending lean operating limits of gasoline engines for control of NOx. Single-cylinder engine tests with small additions of hydrogen to the fuel resulted in very low NOx and CO emissions for hydrogen-isooctane mixtures leaner than 0.55 equivalence ratio. Significant thermal efficiency improvements resulted from the extension beyond iso- octane lean limit operation. However, HC emissions increased markedly at these lean conditions. A passenger car was modified to operate at 0.55-0.65 equivalence ratio with supplemental hydrogen. Vehicle emissions, as established by the 1975 Federal Exhaust Emissions Test, demonstrated the same trends as the single-cylinder engine tests. The success of the hydrogen-supplemented fuel ap- proach will ultimately hinge on the development of both a means of controlling hydrocarbon emissions and a suitable hydrogen source on board the vehicle. Reported efforts to develop a satisfactory onboard hydrogen generator (gasoline reformer) appear restricted by fuel economy considerations. Discussion: John Stocky 1974 SA E Transactions 740188. A Study of Ignition System Effects on Power, Emissions, Lean Misfire Limit, and EGR Tol- 70</page><page sequence="30">740188-740195 erance of a Single-Cylinder Engine - Multiple Spark versus Conventional Single Spark Ignition. J. A. Harrington, R. C. Shishu and J. R. Asik, Ford Motor Co. The characteristics of multiple spark ignition systems with respect to engine performance, emissions, lean misfire, and tolerance to exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) have been investigated using a carbureted single-cylinder engine. The results, which were compared to those obtained with a standard single spark ignition system, show that both lean misfire limit and EGR tolerance are extended with the multiple spark system. The amount of extension varies with engine load, being largest at the lighter loads studied. Engine power and emissions at non-misfiring conditions are the same with both ignition systems. 1974 SA E Transactions 740189. Analysis of Nitric Oxide Formation in Spark Ignition Engine with Heat Transfer and Effect of Ignition Point. G. G. Lucas and K. Varde, University of Technology, Leicestershire (Eng- land). The formation of nitric oxide in the combustion chamber of a spark ignition engine is formulated by developing a simple model. The state of the gas in the chamber and its thermal properties are estimated during a complete cycle. The estimation of the nitric oxide formation is based on the Zeldovich mechanism and assumes the burned gas either in a fully mixed or unmixed state. A simple heat transfer relation is used to estimate the heat loss from the gas to the chamber walls. The effect of the position of the ignition source relative to the exhaust port is also taken into account, and the predicted nitric oxide concentra- tions are compared with experimental results from a single-cylinder variable compression ratio IFP engine. It is found that the nitric oxide concentration pre- dicted by the model agrees well over most of the operating range with the experimentally measured nitric oxide concentrations in the exhaust gas. The effect of the location of the flame initiation point with respect to the exhaust port is also interesting. When the flame is initiated nearer the exhaust valve, the nitric oxide concentration is higher in the exhaust than when the flame is initiated at a point farther from the exhaust valve. 740191. Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of Turbulent Burning Model for Internal Combus- tion Engines. Norman C. Blizard and James C. Keck, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., M. I. T. A model for describing turbulent flame propagation in internal combustion engines is presented. The model is based upon the assumption that eddies having a char- acteristic radius /e are entrained by the flame front at a turbulent entrainment velocity ue and subsequently burn in a characteristic time t = /e/u„ where u, is the laminar flame speed for the fuel-air mixture. An approximate analytic method for determining the equilibrium state of the burned gases is also presented. To verify the predictions of the model, experiments were carried out in a single-cylinder research engine at speeds from 1000-3200 rpm, spark advances from 30-110 deg btc and fuel-air equivalence ratios from 0.7-1.5. Simultaneous measure- ments of the cylinder pressure and the position of the flame front as a function of crank angle were made, and good agree- ment with the predictions of the model was obtained for all operating conditions. Correlations were developed that per- mit both the entrainment speed ue and the eddy radius ß to be calculated from a knowledge of the engine geometry, fuel type, and operating conditions. It is anticipated that the model will be useful for design studies directed toward improving the ef- ficiency and pollution characteristics of internal combustion engines.

Pozzi, SN AM Progetti (Italy). Carbonaceous material associated with potent carcino- gens such as 3-4 benz(a)pyrene (BaP) and other poly- nuclear aromatic (PNA) hydrocarbons constitutes by far the greatest part of the particulate found in the exhaust gases of an internal combustion engine. The probable precursors of carbon particles are radicals formed in the incomplete combustion zone while their nucleation is made possible by ions originating in the flame. Ion current instantaneous values were measured by means of a modified Langmuir's probe, thus calculating thickness and speed of the flame in an engine cylinder. Relations between ion current and collected soot weight were examined. Fuel quality and additive influences over carbon and PNA formation were obtained. Discussion: James C.

Hodgetts, Cranfield Institute of Technology. A mathematical model of an open-chamber diesel engine has been programmed for solution on a digital computer. The program incorporates an automatic procedure which, given the limits of design variables, will predict the values of these variables that will optimize engine performance. This technique can provide these results in a fraction of the time taken by parametric methods and provides a quick and efficient tool that can be used directly by the designer or the development engineer. Examples are given to demonstrate how the technique can be employed to maximize engine power to torque. 1974 SAE Transactions 740195. The Impact of Emission Control Systems on Material Resources. Karl Schwartzwalder and 71</page><page sequence="31">740195-740203 Dana W. Stewart The Clean Air Act has imposed new standards for the maximum allowable amount of emission to escape from vehicle exhaust systems. Catalytic converters were con- sidered as a way of satisfying the standards. The American automotive industry has decided to use plat- inum and palladium in the manufacture of catalytic converters for 1975 model cars. Discussed here are the results of this decision. Two effects of the converters are better fuel economy and increased use of limited material resources. This means that lighter weight cars and increased reclamation of used cars will be necessary to conserve such resources. 740196. Analytical Investigation of the Performance of Catalytic Monoliths of Varying Channel Ge- ometries Based on Mass Transfer Controlling Conditions. W. C. Johnson and J. C. Chang, 3M Co. This paper presents a new criterion for comparing the performance of catalytic monoliths of various channel geometries and a better geometry for analyzing channels of wave-like pattern. Under mass transfer rate controlling conditions, the performance of ducts of different geometry is analyzed and compared on the basis of equivalent duct open area. Results indicate that the monolith length required for a 99% CO conversion is in the following ascending order: conduits of rectangular cross section, wave ducts, equi- lateral triangles, squares, circles, and hexagons. 740198. Low Expansion Ceramic Material for Catalysis Supports. J. L. Pentecost and J. K. Cochran, Georgia Institute of Technology. The characteristics of cordierite type compositions and the relationship between thermal expansion and raw mate- rials, processing, and gross composition are examined. Other possible support materials are reviewed briefly. These include mullite, zircon, beryl, spodumene, alu- minum titanate, silicon nitride, and other low expansion compositions. Raw material cost, processing, and reac- tivity with the catalysis are discussed for these materials. 740199. High Temperature Seals, Automotive and Other Vehicles. L. G. Hiltner, Parker Seal Co. The need for seals to perform at higher and higher temperatures has caused seal manufacturers to continually pursue the upgrading of seal performance. This paper not only discusses the general limits normally associated with polymer types but indicates where progress has been made in upgrading certain materials. In addition, the interdependence of sealing design relationships such as design performance and reliability are presented in an organized format that is designed to help overall evaluation. A few statements are included to summarize the status of International Standardization of Sealing Devices with regard to the implications of the United States going metric and its effect on world trade. 740200. A Study of the Relation Between Used Temper- ature and Sealing Characteristics on Oil Seals. Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Hitoshi Chikamori and Yasuo Mikami, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co. Ltd., (Japan); and Akira Matsushima, NOK- USA, Inc. It is well known that the low-temperature test is successful for rating sealing characteristics of oil seals. Therefore, a compound with good thermal resistance to an ambient temperature range from -40 to + 150°C is needed by the oil seal industry and should be developed. On the other hand, it is indicated that low temperature affects the sealing characteristics and the lip abrasion of oil seals. This paper examines the relation between temperature and the sealing characteristics of oil seals. It is clear that the condition of the rubbing surface is closely related to the sealing characteristics of oil seals, and that the lower the ambient temperature falls, the rougher their rubbing surfaces become. Moreover, the roughening condition of the rubbing surface is intimately related with the environmental temperature, the rubbing period, the lubricating condition, the lip design, and compounds. 740201. Triangular Asperities Control Seal Leakage and Lubrication. Dennis Lee Otto, The Timken Co. Arrays of triangular asperities have been developed for surface treatment of rigid sealing members of either radial lip or face sealing systems. The arrays consist of multiplicities of closely spaced triangular asperities and can be varied in geometry to control the flow of lubricant within the lubricant film which separates the sealing members. The asperities are oriented so that the base of each triangle is parallel to the direction of seal travel. Lubricant flow is directed toward the apex of each triangular asperity. Asperities can be modified in shape to increase fluid film thickness. This technique provides control of seal leakage, temperature, and wear, the primary factors affecting seal performance. 1974 SA E Transactions 740203. Rubber and Lubricant Compatibility. A. S. Berens, National Seal Div., Federal-Mogul Corp. This paper is a review of some of the rubber-lubricant compatibility problems facing the rubber compounder, the oil seal designer, the seal user, and the lubricant supplier as the result of anticipated higher operating temperatures. Lubricants are specified primarily with gears, bear- ings, or total system performance in mind, frequently with little consideration being given to their effect on seals. Rear axle lubricants are reviewed here in some detail along with their effects on various rubber compounds at elevated temperatures. Automatic transmission fluids and engine oil are also considered. The solution to the high-temperature seal problem will 72</page><page sequence="32">740203-740213 be found not only in better seal compounds but also in better high-temperature lubricants which are less severe in their effect on rubber. 740204. Spring Position Measurement: A Review of Current Techniques and a Proposed Non- destructive Measurement Technique. S. N. Smith, National Seal Div., Federal-Mogul Corp. This paper reviews the current terminology, measuring techniques, and definition of this most important radial lip seal parameter. It then attempts to resolve the current controversy by standardizing the terminology, redefining the parameter, and proposing a nondestructive meas- urement technique. The proposed measurement technique can be of value to radial lip seal users as well as suppliers. 740205. Shaft Lead Measurement - A New Technique. J. A. Bentley, Federal-Mogul Corp. A highly magnified picture of the surface of a shaft can be generated by running the profile signal from a stylus scanner into an X-Y recorder. Successive traces across a surface area can then be put together much the same as is the picture from a scanning electron microscope. Thus, a permanent record is made in which not only the lead of a shaft is identifiable, but also the surface condition including pits, flaws, burrs, and cracks. 740206. Toyota ESV Energy Management System and Weight Analysis of a Safety Vehicle. Akihiro Wada, Hiroyuki Watanabe and Masahiro Naka- mura, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). The basic elements of the Toyota ESV energy manage- ment system consist of silicone rubber-type front bumper shock absorbers, an efficient energy-absorbing frame, and upper members for preventing vehicle pitch during impact. The Toyota ESV proved to have satisfactory performance in an 80 km/h frontal impact against flat and pole barriers by adequately balancing the strengths of these elements and effectively arranging the energy- absorbing members of the frame. In addition, based on experiences with the ESV tests, the relationships between crashworthiness variations and vehicle weight or size were studied in detail. 740207. Experimental Safety Vehicles in the 1500 lb, 2000 lb, and 2500 lb Weight Classes - Body Design and Crashworthiness. Giuseppe Puleo, Fiat S.p.A. (Italy). This paper describes and illustrates the more significant results obtained from development and test work on crashworthiness of three European ESVs in the 1500, 2000, and 2500 lb classes of current production cars. The diversity of weight, mechanical layout, and body features of the three types of cars - each type considered in the standard, reinforced, and ESV versions - has allowed a detailed survey of the more significant problems that may arise in improving crashworthiness. Emphasis is placed on the effect of the high specification requirements for the 4000 lb ESV in relation to the weight and cost of these car classes. 740208. On Crashworthiness of Nissan ESV. Kenichi Mitsuhashi, Hideo Shimoe, Norimoto Aya and Makoto Tsutamoto, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. It is very difficult for small cars to protect occupants in high-speed collisions. The Nissan ESV is of lightweight monocoque construction, and its body possesses crash- worthiness designed to match the occupant protection system. This vehicle has experimentally proved to be effective in occupant protection. This paper primarily deals with the most difficult problem of crashworthiness in frontal collisions, first referring to the basic analyses and test results acquired in the development process, and then setting forth the body construction and test results of the two types of Nissan ESV (Ex and E2). 1974 SAE Transactions 740211. Effect of Ground on Near-Horizontal Sound Propagation. J. E. Piercy and T. F. W. Embleton, National Research Council (Ottawa). The propagation of sound from a small source over the ground, considered as an impedance boundary, is dis- cussed theoretically and compared with measurements over short grass and asphalt. Interference phenomena relevant to the measurement configurations in SAE standard procedures for testing vehicles are emphasized. The effect of the ground impedance on propagation at the longer distances relevant to airport and highway design is also discussed. 1974 SAE Transactions 740212. Relating Acoustical Measurements to SAE Pro- cedures. Anthony J. Schneider, B &amp; K Instru- ments, Inc. The measurement of noise can be a rather complicated task. At least, it must not be taken for granted. One problem is that noise is a dynamic phenomenon. The other problem is that a microphone often affects the acoustical field it is trying to sense. These are strange phenomena to those of us who deal only with slowly varying signals and with transducers which do not affect their environment. The object of this paper is to list and explain the precautions that must be taken when meas- uring noise and documenting acoustical data for SAE criteria. 740213. Progress in Diesel Odor Research. C. William Savery and Richard A. Matula, Drexel Univer- sity; and Thomas Asmus, Chrysler Corp. Only 2 of the 1 1 laboratories which have had diesel odor research projects underway during the last 16 years are still active in this research area. Much of the earlier work was devoted to developing diesel odor sampling, stan- dards, and measurement techniques. Subsequently, work became generally focused upon the chemical identifi- cation of the odorants, a very difficult task due to their 73</page><page sequence="33">740213-740217 large number and low concentrations. After three years of concentrated effort involving the development of new odor measurement, sampling, and diesel exhaust analysis and preparation techniques, odorants comprising the two major diesel odor characteristics were identified. Com- pounds which are also components of diesel fuel were shown to contribute to one odor characteristic. Oxydized derivatives, generally of the same classes of compounds as those shown to contribute to the first odor characteristic, were tentatively identified by structure to comprise the second major odor characteristic. The recent work has resulted in the development of a laboratory prototype instrument for determining diesel odor. Although re- search has been hindered by the requirement of subjective odor measurements, the limitation of analytical tech- niques, and the limited understanding of the diesel combustion process, significant progress has been made in diesel odor research which has already led to the reduction of diesel odor emissions. 1974 SAE Transactions 740214. Public Opinion of Diesel Odor. Charles T. Hare and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Insti- tute; Joseph H. Somers and Thomas A. Hüls, Environmental Protection Agency. This paper describes the results of a public opinion survey on testing of diesel exhaust odors conducted during 1969 and 1970. Major goals of the research were to relate public opinion of the odors and the objectionability associated with them to odor intensity, and to obtain a dose-response curve as the primary result. The dose- response curve was needed to assess odor-control tech- nology by providing a criterion for deciding whether or not the effect of a given control item would be noticed by the general public, reduce complaints, or be worth the cost and effort required for its implementation. The engine used as the live odor source for the subject research was a two-stroke cycle type similar to those used in many buses. This engine type was chosen because its exposure to the public in urban bus applications is very widespread, and because a large portion of the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency's odor research had been performed with similar engines. It was found that a relationship existed between perceived diesel exhaust odor intensity and the object- ionability of these odors. The nature of this relationship was that increasingly intense diesel odors were considered increasingly objectionable. The data also show that a substantial reduction in diesel exhaust odor intensity would be required to cause a worthwhile reduction in the objectionability of these odors. 1974 SAE Transactions 740215. Diesel Exhaust Odor Analysis by Sensory Tech- niques. D. A. Kendall, P. L. Levins and G. Leonardos, Arthur D. Little, Inc. The odor profile method has been applied to the measurement and analysis of diesel exhaust odor. The human sensory panel has described the odor of diluted exhaust and analytical fractions isolated from the exhaust in terms of total intensity of aroma (TIA), and individual odor character notes. For convenience, diesel exhaust odor can be described in two character groups - oily- kerosene and smoky-burnt odor. The odorous species were determined by detailed chemical analyses supported by comparative data from reference compounds. To achieve reliable quantitative odor intensity measurements, it was necessary to present the odor panel with a series of concentrations (dilutions) of exhaust in air over a wide range. The odor intensity at a given exhaust concen- tration is computed from a least squares analysis of the entire panel data. The results demonstrate an odor intensity range of slight to moderately strong for diesel exhaust at 1000:1 dilution. Discussion: Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute.; W. F. Marshall 1974 SAE Transactions 740216. Chemical Analysis of Diesel Exhaust Odor Spe- cies. P. L. Levins, D. A. Kendall, A. B. Caragay, G. Leonardos and J. E. Oberholtzer, Arthur D. Little, Inc. Sensory studies have described diesel exhaust odor in terms of two major odor character groups - oily-kerosene and smoky-burnt. The odorous compounds have been identified in a detailed analytical chemistry-odor study. The oily-kerosene odor group is associated with the aromatic portion of the unburned fuel - principally, the alkyl substituted benzenes, indans, and tetralins. The smoky-burnt odors arise from partial combustion prod- ucts of the paraffin and aromatic fuel components. Our studies have shown a good correlation between exhaust odor intensity and abundance of the partial combustion products. An analytical method has been developed, based on liquid chromatography, for the quantitative expression of exhaust odor intensity by measurement of the smoky-burnt odor group. Initial survey studies show the method to be applicable over a wide odor emission range. Fuel variation has little effect, whereas injector variables do influence odor intensity. 1974 SAE Transactions 740217. Sinusoidal Simulation of Fatigue Under Random Loading. R. B. Thakkar, A. O. Smith Corp.; and K. G. McConnell, Iowa State University. A new theory was developed to obtain an exact sinusoidal simulation of material fatigue life when subjected to a gaussian narrow band random loading. The theory was based upon duplicating the probability density distri- bution of peak amplitudes that is Rayleigh. An experimental investigation was conducted to obtain validity of this theory. The fatigue lives obtained under the two types of loading compared within 10%. The statistical probability density distribution of input and output acceleration processes for both types of loading compared very well. It is believed that the approach of 74</page><page sequence="34">740217-740223 the theory described herein can be applied to any real loading time history where the probability density dis- tribution of the actual field service peak amplitudes is known. 740218. Quality Exponent Method for Planning and Interpretation of Results of Full-Scale, Low- Cycle Fatigue Tests. E. Schaap, Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd. A method is presented for safe-life calculations of aluminum structures subjected to low-cycle fatigue load- ing. The method is based upon the linear relation between log S and log N in the domain of low-cycle fatigue. Miner's Rule obtains the following new formulation: n^ (Srnax/ Ks)qj = 1 with qj = qo (Smax/Saj) 2/7 • The use of the formulas involves a single parameter, q0, or an equivalent-quality exponent to be found by test. Other quantities in the formulas are the variables: nj - number of cycles, Smaxj - maximum stress of the loading cycle, Saj - alternating stress of the loading cycle, and a material constant, Ks, named virtual ultimate fatigue stress. The selection of a safe-life quality exponent results in specifying safe-life coupled to a certain probability of survival at a certain confidence level. 740219. Automotive High-Density Digital Tape Recording System. T. J. Flis, Ford Motor Co.; and F. B. Cupp, Edmac Associates, Inc. A high-packing-density digital tape recorder has been developed for long-term mobile recording of low-fre- quency analog input data. The recorder operates un- attended directly from the car battery and offers signif- icant advantages over conventional FM instrumentation tape recorders in size, power, weight, channel count, and record time. A separate playback unit enters the digital data directly into a computer for analysis, and provides an analog reconstruct of any one of the input channels for graphic analysis. The recording system is discussed with the aid of a functional block diagram, and samples of reconstructed data from actual road tests are presented to illustrate the performance of the recorder in a severe shock and vibration environment. 740220. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics and Its Appli- cation to Fatigue. Ralph I. Stephens, University of Iowa. This paper summarizes the major aspects of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) as a quantitative design criterion against brittle fracture. It describes the extension of LEFM to subcriticai crack growth under fatigue conditions. To apply this design criterion, however, the engineer must accept the notion that his structure or component does contain flaws or cracks. Fatigue design using LEFM thus assumes preexisting flaws or cracks; hence, fatigue life is based on subcriticai crack growth followed by final fracture. Subcriticai crack growth under both constant amplitude and variable amplitude loading is considered along with peak tensile or compressive over- loads. 740221. Effect of Periodic Large Strain Cycles on the Fatigue Behavior of Steels. W. R. Brose, Uni- versity of Illinois; N. E. Dowling, Westinghouse Electric Corp.; and JoDean Morrow, University of Illinois. Data are reported for smooth specimens of SAE 4340, RQC-100, and Man-Ten steels subjected to constant stress amplitude cycling below the conventional fatigue limit. The presence of occasional large strain cycles, or over- strains, in the history resulted in finite lives. Possible causes of this effect are discussed, and it is shown that the deformation response of these steels is altered by over- strain. Inelastic strain-life data for the periodic overstrain and initial overstrain tests fall on the same line in a log-log plot that represents the nonoverstrain tests at shorter lives. The use of inelastic strain as a fatigue damage parameter is discussed. 740222. The Effect of Composition and Microstructure on the Pitting Fatigue of Carburized Steel Cases. M. A. H. Howes, IIT Research Institute; and J. P. Sheehan, Packer Engineering Associates. The pitting fatigue of a wide range of heat-treated carburizing steels has been investigated. The effects of compositions conforming to 1024, 8620, 4620, 4027, 2048, 4419, 4817 and 9310 at two levels of case carbon content were studied in lubricated concentrated contact. Dif- ferent microstructures were produced in the 4817 and 9310 steels by combination of case carbon level and subzero treatments. Testing was carried out on geared roller test machines. Pitting fatigue was found to be dependent on micro- structure rather than steel composition. As long as the steel possessed sufficient hardenability to avoid trans- formation products, then fatigue life is not markedly different. It appears that the presence of retained austenite can improve pitting fatigue resistance. 1974 SAE Transactions 740223. Fatigue Crack Growth Delays. Robert Dubensky, Ford Motor Co. The effects of single and multiple tensile overloads on precracked enter-notched sheet specimens of Ti-8 Al-1 Mo- IV titanium alloy were investigated under laboratory conditions. Single tensile overloads always delayed sub- sequent fatigue crack growth at lower stress levels. Multiple tensile overloads caused a delay in fatigue crack growth greater than a single overload, with the amount depending on the number of overloads. The quantitative values of fatigue crack growth delay are reported for overloads ranging from 116-233%. Single intermittent overloads applied within the delay caused by previous overloads produced the greatest delays. Conditions sub- 75</page><page sequence="35">740224-740231 sequent to overloading and encountered in realistic environment - including time at zero load, temperature, and a sea-water environment - were found to reduce the delay effects greatly and should be incorporated into theoretical models. These effects are explained in terms of fatigue crack closure concepts. 740224. Systems Approach to Mass Transportation. Roger H. Harrison, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Tu- dor, Bechtel. Construction of a mass transit system is usually among the largest of civil projects, running into billions of dollars. The disruptive act of building exclusive mass transit rights-of-way through densely populated areas will further aggravate existing modes of transportation. The general case of a metropolitan area whose population is in excess of a million people is examined with regard to selection and design of a mass transpor- tation system. Systems that can handle 100,000-200,000 passengers during morning and evening rush hours are discussed. 740225. Modern Transportation Systems. D. L. Hearn and N. H. Van Dorn, Rohr Industries, Inc. There is a crisis in ground transportation arising out of the increasing mobility of a growing population, heightened by the increasing mobility and consequent resource depletion of the world at large. Rohr Industries is committed to developing multiple ground technologies to satisfy transportation's varied needs. This paper discusses the company's diversification from aerospace into ground transportation, starting with rapid transit systems and leading to advanced transportation systems. The two most promising advanced transportation developments include an aerotrain, a tracked air cushion vehicle, and the Romag, a magnetically levitated and propelled vehicle. This paper reviews these events and describes in detail the two new developments. 740226. ACT - Ford's Automatically Controlled Trans- portation System. J. S. Logan, Ford Motor Co. This paper contains a technical description of the Ford Motor Co. 's ACT system which has been designed to meet transportation needs in a wide variety of urban appli- cations. The discussion covers the systems design features and operation of the driverless rubber-tired vehicles, the guideway, and the system's ability to meet expanding needs by a modular approach to the command and control design. Descriptions of Ford's new Cherry Hill Test Track and the first installations at the Fairlane Town Center in Dearborn, Mich., and the Bradley International Airport, Hartford, Conn., are also presented. 740227. The New United States Standard Light Rail Vehicle. Martin Lenow, The Boeing Vertol Co. This paper presents details of the new United States standard light rail vehicle (LRV) being built by the Boeing Vertol Co. for the Boston and San Francisco public transportation authorities. System operation, design features, and performance are described for the LRV, successor to the ubiquitous President's Conference Com- mittee car, last built in the United States in 1951. Used most effectively for an intermediate mass transit volume of 8000-24,000 passengers/h, the Boeing LRV incorpo- rates much of the available state-of-the-art technology. 740228. Rubber Tire vs. Steel Wheel Tradeoffs. Matthew C. Harrison, Tudor Engineering Co. The choice of rubber tired or steel wheeled vehicles for a mass rapid transit (MRT) system or for a personal rapid transit (PRT) system involves a number of considerations. For the PRT system, the rubber tired vehicle possesses advantages in its ability to utilize steeper grades and shorter radius curves. The rubber tired vehicle can, if required, operate without a fixed guideway. It is more economical than the steel wheeled vehicle for PRT application. The steel on steel system seems to have little application to PRT as PRT is defined in this paper. For MRT systems, the advantages of the steel on steel system seem quite evident. Capacity, operating speed, and passenger comfort are increased with the steel on steel system. Energy requirements and the need for environ- mental control are decreased with the steel wheeled system. Capital costs for the infrastructure and the systemwide elements of the system decrease with the use of a steel wheeled MRT system, as do maintenance and operations costs. 740229. Personal Rapid Transit System in Morgantown, West Virginia. Richard T. Crowley, Boeing Co. A unique personal rapid transit system is currently being installed at Morgantown, West Virginia. The system consists of small, automatically controlled vehicles oper- ating on a dedicated guideway either on a scheduled basis or on a passenger-demand basis. The rubber-tired, electric-powered vehicles will carry up to 21 people. The transportation system will connect the business district of Morgantown and the widely separated areas of the West Virginia University campus. The overall project is being built in phases, with the first phase being the construction of approximately 2.1 miles of guideway, five vehicles, three stations, and a maintenance facility. Final instal- lation will be approximately 4.0 miles of guideway, 70-100 vehicles, six stations, and an expanded maintenance facility. 740231. Kinetic Energy Systems for Moving People. J. W. Baxter and L. J. Lawson, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., Inc. This paper considers the need for improving urban transportation and the proposed air quality plans that have been recently announced by the Environmental Protection Agency for several of the more populated regional basins. The "transit diversion mandate" (the need 76</page><page sequence="36">740231-740237 for diversion of a considerable portion of urban travel from the automobile to public transit) is discussed. One proposed diversionary approach, the rubber-tired trolley coach, with its quiet, reliable, and pollution-free char- acteristics and an advanced LMSC kinetic energy flywheel which can be used to broaden considerably the capabil- ities of the trolley coach are described. 740232. Concrete Vs. Steel - Aerial Guideway Tradeoffs. Stanley H. Froid and Joseph J. Sacco, Tudor Engineering Co. The designer of an aerial guideway structure for new transit systems has a choice of two major construction materials - concrete and steel. His selection will depend largely on four considerations: esthetic, structural, eco- nomic, and acoustical. Esthetic considerations cover such matters as con- figuration, compatibility of the structure with the envi- ronment, color, and surface texture. Structural consid- erations cover foundation requirements and size and shape of members to accommodate the design loads. Economic considerations include comparative costs of girders of various lengths, ease of installation in available right-of-way, comparison techniques possible through the use of one material or another, capability of local materials producers in terms of both technological expertise and plant capacity, and comparative cost of maintenance. Acoustical considerations include the abil- ity of the material to minimize noise or to permit treatment which will absorb noise. Neither steel nor concrete offers all of the charac- teristics sought. By a process of both objective analysis and good taste, the designer selects one of the other, or produces a composite design to incorporate the better features of both. 740234. Spin Testing of Ceramic Turbine Rotors. K. H. Styhr, Ford Motor Co. A major portion of the Ford ceramic turbine rotor fabrication program is directed at a multielement ap- proach in which elements of various complexity and property requirements such as the ring of blades, the hub, reinforced platform, etc., are individually formed and subsequently jointed together to form a complete rotor. Testing of such rotors included a cold spin test of each element of the assembly, designed to establish its strength level while photographing the failure to establish the failure mode. Assemblies of two or more elements joined or bonded under a variety of conditions have also been cold spin tested during the development of the joining technique and the evaluation of various design modifi- cations. A wide range of failure conditions have been identified during the cold spin testing phase allowing the development of improved rotors suitable for subsequent hot test and engine development. 740235. Gas Turbine Ceramic Vane Testing. C. G. Nessier, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Prototype silicon nitride vanes for industrial and aircraft engines were constructed and tested. Relevant material properties were determined for hot pressed silicon nitride and silicon carbide. The capability of these ceramics was compared to vane superalloys in tests relating to high pressure and temperature gas turbine environments. Ceramics in current favor are superior to those which failed in decades past. However, they probably need further improvement if they are to replace cooled superalloys in long life cyclic applications. In more advanced engines, cooling may be required to keep ceramic vanes within their useful temperature range. The primary limitations revealed were a propensity for sudden thermal fatigue crack propagation and low impact damage resistance. Nonetheless, ceramics still offer great potential benefit in improving performance and efficiency. To achieve success in the use of ceramics it will be necessary to attack their limitations directly. Required work will include establishing specialized performance criteria, careful design analysis, and goal-oriented material development. 1974 SA E Transactions 740236. Testing Ceramic Stator Vanes for Industrial Gas Turbines. R. J. Bratton, Research Labs., West- inghouse; A. N. Holden and S. E. Mumford, Gas Turbine Systems Div., Westinghouse. A program to design and test ceramic stator vanes of the size required for large industrial gas tubines has been in progress for the past two years. These ceramic vanes are designed for operation at 2200-2500°F (1204-1341 °C) without cooling. The first testing phase was completed. This consisted of subjecting a full-scale prototype stator vane assembly and all supporting structures to 100 cycles of startup and shutdown for a turbine inlet temperature of 2200° F (1204°C). Details of the test assembly, the Si3N4 ceramic parts, and the test rig are described and the results of the tests are discussed. Results completed to date indicate that a viable design has been achieved which can be translated into high- temperature testing and future turbine design with only minor modifications. 740237. Aluminum Nitride and Silicon Nitride for High Temperature Gas Turbine Engines. Katsutoshi Komeya, Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd.; and Fumiyoshi Nöda, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. High-strength A IN and Si3N4, which have been produced by hot pressing powder compacts with available sintering aids, are potential candidates for high-temperature vehic- ular gas turbine engines. In this paper, typical properties for both materials, rotor testing results at room temper- ature using model blades, and some designed ceramic components are presented. 1974 SA E Transactions 77</page><page sequence="37">740238-740244 740238.

Evaluation of Ceramics for Small Gas Turbine Engines. Robert J. Beck, Teledyne CAE. Ceramic components for small gas turbine engines offer both reduced cost and increased performance compared to cooled metal components. Results of cost and performance studies are presented for metal and ceramic components. Thermal shock data are presented on various ceramics which show the superiority of hot-pressed silicon nitride and vapor-deposited silicon carbide.

Probst, NASA Lewis Research Center. This report summarizes programs at the NASA Lewis Research Center evaluating several classes of commercial ceramics, in a high gas velocity burner rig simulating a gas turbine engine environment. Testing of 23 ceramics in rod geometry identified SiC and Si3N4 as outstanding in resistance to oxidation and thermal stress and identified the failure modes of other ceramics. Further testing of a group of 15 types of SiC and Si3N4 in simulated vane shape geometry has identified a hot pressed SiC, a reaction sintered SiC, and hot pressed Si3N4 as the best of that group. SiC and Si3N4 test specimens were compared on the basis of weight change, dimensional reductions, metallography, fluorescent penetrant inspection, x-ray diffraction analyses, and failure mode. 1974 SA E Transactions 740241. Ceramic Roller Bearings for High Speed and High Temperature Applications. David V. Sund- berg, Federal-Mogul Corp. Hot pressed silicon nitride has excellent rolling contact fatigue resistance, good wear characteristics, and excellent dimensional stability in addition to its known physical properties of a low density and excellent elevated temperature strength and hardness. Precision quality roller bearings have been fabricated with silicon nitride rolling elements and M-50 steel races and, also, with both races and the rollers made from silicon nitride. These bearings, tested at speeds to one-half million DN (bore diameter X speed in rpm) and under heavy loads to give accelerated test conditions, show promise for the use of hot pressed silicon nitride as a bearing material. 1974 SA E Transactions 740242. Ceramics for Gas Turbines, Present and Future. M. L. Torti, Norton Co. Silicon nitride and silicon carbide, the two material systems of most interest for gas turbine applications are both consolidated by two different procedures - hot pressing and sintering. Hot pressing results in a fully dense structure with comparatively higher strength and cost, and limited shape capability. Sintering on the other hand results in a less dense structure with lower strengths and costs, but extensive shape capability. Typical properties are reviewed highlighting differ- ences .between these ceramic systems and the metals commonly employed. Recent advances in the state-of-the-art are presented pointing out areas of likely future developments and contrasting these to areas where improvements are most desired. 740243. Flow Through Catalytic Converters - An Ana- lytical and Experimental Treatment. Charles D. Lemme and William R. Givens, Maremont Corp. A method for measuring and comparing the flow distri- bution of a monolithic catalytic converter is developed and the important parameters influencing flow are determined. The pressure losses through a converter are measured and analyzed and a theoretical relationship between flow distribution and converter life is developed. 740244. Flow Effects in Monolithic Honeycomb Auto- motive Catalytic Converters. J. S. Howitt and T. C. Sekella, Corning Glass Works. This paper describes the results of durability tests of monolithic catalytic converters with mechanical devices used to tailor the exhaust gas flow. Deflectors of several different shapes show promise of extending the useful life of the converter by improving conversion efficiencies of hydrocarbons and CO. The tests were run on en- gine/dynamometers with round cross-sectional area sam- ples and with symmetrical inlet cones. Improvements are found in initial activity and reduced deterioration. The penalty for altering the flow is in slower catalyst light-off and increased pressure drop. Sequential photographs of catalyst light-off with different flow distributions are included, as well as postmortem analysis of catalyst loading and poison 78</page><page sequence="38">740244-740249 deposition. The potential benefits appear to be a result of a more balanced exhaust gas flow over the monolith cross section and thereby providing more effective use of the catalyst. 1974 SA E Transactions 740245. Catalytic Converter Testing with Portable Engine Dynamometers. Bruce D. Lockhart and Stanley L. Genslak, Engrg. Staff, General Motors Corp. A test facility has been developed utilizing engine dynamometers to age catalyst. The engine operating parameters and thus the input to the catalyst were set to duplicate the environment of the catalyst during vehicle test on the federal Appendix D durability schedule. Results from the experimental car durability test have shown that the primary cause of catalyst performance loss on this schedule has been due to contamination buildup on the catalyst surface. Catalyst aged on the engine dynamometer facility has shown very good performance loss correlation to similar catalyst aged in the vehicle test. This correlation has allowed the use of this engine dynamometer facility to investigate various catalyst parameter effects on the durability performance of the catalyst. 740246. A Technique for Endurance Testing of Oxidation Catalytic Reactors. R. A. Haslett, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd. The conventional method of catalyst endurance testing on vehicles is unsuitable for large-scale catalyst development, since the time and cost are prohibitive. This paper reviews a series of experiments comparing the effects of two methods of engine test-bed aging on catalyst deterioration with the normal vehicle endurance test. The test-bed engines caused a higher rate of catalyst deterioration than the vehicle, and there are indications that this effect is related to the intake mixture strength of the engine. From these experiments, a technique for accelerated catalyst aging was derived. The reactor is aged on a test bed for three periods, each of 100 h. At the 0, 100, 200, and 300 h stages, the reactor is removed from the test bed and transferred to another engine for detailed tests of catalyst performance. A 1975 CVS test on a vehicle is also included in each set of experiments. Results from some of the catalytic reactors, tested by this technique, are presented. 740247. The Influence of Vehicle Parameters on Catalyst Space Velocity and Size Requirements. J. G. Hansel, K. Aykan and J. G. Cohn, Engelhard Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corp. A linear correlation between catalyst volume requirements and inertia weights allows sizing of monolithic emission control catalysts without the need for other measure- ments. Despite the fact that this correlation is only approximate, neglecting factors such as variations in the air/fuel ratios, actual emission levels in the exhaust, exhaust temperatures, it is practically sufficient for groups of engines or automobiles with similar emission control systems. After the required catalyst volume has been determined for one car adequate to meet the Federal emission standard at 50,000 miles, the catalyst require- ments for other vehicles in the group can be computed. 740248. Fuel Effects on Oxidation Catalysts and Oxi- dation Catalyst Systems, II. Eugene L. Holt and Eric E. Wigg, Esso Research and Engineering Co.; and Arthur H. Neal, Esso Research Labs. The study of the effects of lead on noble metal automotive oxidation catalysts has been continued using engine and chassis dynamometer units as well as laboratory evalu- ations. Work has been carried out with monolithic and pelletized catalysts and with lead levels ranging from trace to 3.5 g/gal. Engine and chassis dynamometer studies with mono- liths have confirmed earlier findings that trace lead up to the 0.07-0.10 g/gal level has almost no effect on activity maintenance during long term aging. At higher trace levels, deactivation effects become apparent over the long term. However, brief exposures to fully leaded fuels in dynamometer or customer testing do not seem to affect catalyst life. Thus, single tankfuls of fuel at up to 3.5 g/gal had no measurable permanent effect on catalyst activity measured by the Federal Test Procedure, although conversion efficiency was temporarily lost while the leaded fuels were in use and some permanent loss in steady-state conversion was noted. Halide scavenger compounds used in conjunction with lead additives are responsible for much of this temporary activity loss. Initial testing of beaded catalysts indicates they are no more sensitive to traces of lead than the monoliths. Catalysts subjected to dynamometer aging for the equiv- alent of 25,000 miles with fuel containing 0.10 g/gal of lead easily met CO and HC emission standards of 3.4 and 0.41 g/mile, respectively in vehicle FTP testing. Laboratory studies of aged catalysts showed a cor- relation between lead content and activity, with the first increments of lead causing the greatest deactivation. These results contradict vehicle test results showing a linear deactivation trend with lead accumulation, accen- tuating the difference between laboratory and vehicle studies of lead effects. An effect on HC conversion activity of oxygen concentration was also found, which may be relevant to the quantity of excess air supplied to vehicle mounted catalysts. 1974 SA E Transactions 740249. Nitrogen Oxide Removal Catalysts for Purifi- cation of Automobile Exhaust Gases. D. R. Ashmead, J. S. Campbell, P. Davies and K. Farmery, Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (England). The chemistry involved in the selective catalytic reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOJ to nitrogen is outlined and the requirements of a practical NOx reduction catalyst are summarized. The effects of temperature, gas composition, 79</page><page sequence="39">740249-740256 NOx concentration, and sulfur dioxide on the activity of some potential NOx catalysts have been studied. Steady- state engine dynamometer endurance runs with ruthenium and non-ruthenium catalysts are described, and some vehicle durability data with particulate and monolithic base metal containing NOx catalysts are also presented. 740250. Stabilized Ruthenium Catalysts for NOx Reduc- tion. T. P. Kobyliński, B. W. Taylor and J. E. Young, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co. Some of the problems encountered in the use of ruthen- ium as a NOx reduction catalyst are described. The major problem of volatilization in high temperature oxidizing atmospheres has been overcome by providing a stabilizing matrix for the ruthenium. The stabilized catalyst, how- ever, does not have good CO and HC oxidizing per- formance, such as is required when the NOx catalyst is used for oxidation under cold start conditions. Co- impregnation of Pt and Ru is ineffective in improving this situation, and it was necessary to develop a novel procedure to improve catalyst oxidation activity. Engine dynamometer tests showed that the final catalyst performs well under all of the conditions to which it is subjected. The questions which remains unanswered is the durability of the system. 1974 SA E Transactions 740251. Initial Performance of Supported NOx Reduction Catalysts in a Dual-Catalyst System. Gerald J. Barnes and Richard L. Klimisch, General Mo- tors Corp. The initial NOx reduction activity of several alumina- supported, platinum-group metal catalysts is evaluated in vehicle tests. The experimental vehicle was equipped with two 36 in3 NOldx converters, and a 260 in3 oxidation converter containing a pelleted platinum catalyst, rich carburetion, and exhaust gas recirculation. The NOx catalysts included Ru, Ru-Pt, Ru-Pd, mechanical mixtures of Ru and Pt, Pt-Ni, Pt, and Pd. As evaluated over the 1975 FTP, the NOx reducing effec- tiveness of these catalysts was: Ru combinations &gt;Pt- Ni&gt;Pt&gt;Pd. Modulated air injection was used, enabling the Nox converters to be used as oxidizing converters during vehicle start-up. Operation in this mode greatly reduced HC and CO emissions, with an acceptable increase in NOx emissions. In addition, the NOx reduction performance of all the NOx catalysts was enhanced by bleeding a small amount of air into the NOx converters. Minimum NOx emissions corresponded to air bleed rates of 3-4% of the total engine airflow. The air bleed effect was due to decreased NH3 formation over Ru, and to increased NOx activity due to higher catalyst temperatures over Pt. 1974 SA E Transactions 740252. Factors Affecting Dual Catalyst System Per- formance. R. J. Lang, W. R. Leppard and L. S. Bernstein, Esso Research and Engineering Co. Results of warmup and fuel economy studies on a dual catalyst system using GEM reinforced Ni-Cu Nox reduc- tion catalysts and PTX-II B oxidation catalysts are reported. Rapid warmup of this system is required to control emissions to the target level of 3.4 g/mile CO, 0.41 g/mile HC, and 0.4 g/mile Nox. This rapid warmup can be obtained only by oxidizing the CO, HC, and H2 in the exhaust during the first 30-60 s after start-up. Methods of inducing oxidation are described. Controlling Nox to 0.4 g/mile requires GEM catalyst temperatures of ~1300, 200-300°F hotter than exhaust temperature during warmed-up operation. The additional temperature can be generated by enriching carburetion and oxidizing the CO, H2, and HC formed, or by spark retard. Studies conducted on a 1973 350 CID Chevrolet indicate a - 4%/100°F fuel penalty for increasing tem- perature by richer carburetion and air bleed at constant spark timing, and a ~8%/100°F penalty for spark retard at constant carburetion. Reducing the fuel economy penalty associated with meeting stringent Nox emission standards with dual catalyst systems, will require the development of durable NOx reduction catalysts which show high activity at normal exhaust temperature. The purpose of this paper is to report the latest results from these continuing studies of factors affecting the level of emission control and the fuel economy of vehicles equipped with dual catalyst systems incorporating GEM NOx reduction catalysts. Discussed are catalyst system warmup, its effect on emissions; and maintenance of catalyst temperature and its effect on emissions and fuel economy. 740253. Can Adhesives Help You? G. L. Schneberger, General Motors Institute. This paper reviews briefly the widespread use of adhesives and gives reasons for their popularity. Common types of adhesives are presented with examples of their use. The life expectance of adhesive bonds is briefly discussed. Some of the problems to be expected when converting to adhesive bonding are described. 740255. Anaerobics - An Answer to the Ideal Gasket Search. J. William Paris, Loctite Corp. A new anaerobic material has been developed which overcomes many of the problems associated with pre- formed, precut and other formed-in-place gaskets. This new material does not migrate or drip, can be applied by either tracing or stenciling, offers instant sealing capa- bility, and cures upon confinement into a tough, non- relaxing, gap-filling solid. 740256. Bonding of FRP Structures with Room Tem- perature Curing Acrylic Adhesives. John F. Coleman, The B. F. Goodrich Co. Modified acrylic resin adhesives bond well to a wide variety of metallic and nonmetallic substrates. They may also be used to bond dissimilar materials such as 80</page><page sequence="40">740256-740264 aluminum to glass fiber reinforced polyester (FRP). These room temperature curing structural adhesives equal or exceed the inherent strengths of many engineering thermoplastics. When properly prepared, these adhesives give bonds of outstanding durability to heat, moisture, and outdoor exposure. Both static and dynamic adhesive durability studies have been carried out on several systems which are representative of this type of acrylic resin adhesive. Bonding of FRP structures requires some surface preparation prior to application of the adhesive. With proper application, modified acrylic adhesive bond strengths are superior to either room temperature (RT) epoxy or urethane adhesive bond strengths. The RT cures can be thermally accelerated to give even more durable bonds. Some durability data for the acrylic, and RT epoxy, and a urethane will be compared. 740258. A Review of Recent Developments in the Holo- graphic Observation of Disbonds. Paul J. Kisat- sky and Modesto Barbarisi, Picatinny Arsenal, U. S. Army. Holographic techniques have been employed to observe nondestructively the presence of disbonds or bond degradation in adhesives of thin and thick laminates. It is shown that when panels of honeycomb aircraft skin are exposed to prolonged humidity, the time history of bond weakening can be holographically observed as the humid- ity attack proceeds inward from the edges. While heat stressing is suitable to the holographic observation of disbonds in "thin" laminates, it generally fails in thick structures. A second technique of exciting resonance patterns of disbonds and observing them with time- averaged holography is suitable for use with thicker materials. Various mode patterns of disbonds have been observed in "thick" laminates of the ceramic-fiberglass epoxy composites considered for use in applications such as missile radomes. 1974 SA E Transactions 740259. Adhesively Bonded Laminated Metal Structure. Robert J. Stout, General Dynamics Corp. Adhesively bonded metallic laminates are a fabrication concept for providing fail-safe structure. This type of structure was evaluated under Air Force Contract AF33(6 1 5)-73-C-300 1 , "Advanced Metallic Air Vehicle Structures Program." Development of a bonding process for large-area bonding, adhesives test data, and com- ponent test data from the program are discussed. 740261. Hot Melt Bonding with High-Strength Thermo- plastic Rubber Polymers. Jeffrey J. Bell and W. J. Robertson, Shell Chemical Co. This paper presents a discussion of Kraton thermoplastic rubber in its application as a raw material for hot melt adhesives. There is a description of the physcial and chemical properties of Kraton thermoplastic rubber resulting from its unique molecular structure: a rubbery midblock with two polystyrene endblocks (the simplest molecule); the raw material is thus though and elastic in addition to being soluble. A two-phase system is formed with the midblock being the continuous phase and the endblocks the dispersive phase. Basic to the formulator's understanding is this two-phase system. Practical starting formulations are given and general principles of Kraton thermoplastic rubber are outlined enabling the formulator to adapt the raw material to his specific needs. 740262. Material and Design Guidelines for Reinforced Thermoplastic Body Panels. C. R. Grimball and N. J. Jackson, Guide Lamp Div., General Motors Corp. This paper describes new reinforced thermoplastic mate- rials that have been developed for rigid exterior, painted automobile panels. Traditionally, these panels have been fabricated from zinc die cast, steel, or more recently from sheet molding compound (SMC). Guide Lamp Division, General Motors, is injection molding mineral filled nylon, fiberglass reinforced nylon, and fiberglass reinforced thermoplastic polyester rigid exterior automotive panels that are painted car color for 1974 Chevelles, Cadillacs, Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, and Buicks. The applications, material properties, paint performance, and design rec- ommendations for these three reinforced thermoplastic materials are reviewed. 740263. Glass Reinforced Nylon 6 Copolymers - A New Level of Performance. A. C. Bernardo and R. J. Welgos, Allied Chemical Corp. Wide ranges of properties are obtainable from nylons via the incorporation of various fillers or by the chemical alteration of the polymer chain. Using the latter route Capron nylon copolymers offer a high degree of flexibility and impact resistance at both low and ambient temper- atures. Using several different Capron copolymers as base materials, various levels of fiberglass have been incor- porated resulting in high heat distortion temperatures and increased dimensional stability, coupled with improved impact resistance. The comparison of glass reinforced Capron co- polymers with glass reinforced homopolymers show these unique resins to possess superior impact resistance while retaining high levels of stiffness and heat deflection. 740264. Fiber Orientation in Fiber-Reinforced Plastics and How it Affects Automotive Applications. E. M. Rowbotham, Ford Motor Co., Ltd. This paper discusses how the orientation of fiber in fiber-reinforced plastics affects automotive applications. Orientation can adversely affect moldings in applications where stress is important, especially in engine components such as front timing covers, pump flanges, oil sump bosses, and crankshaft housing. The paper examines these problems in detail and suggests ways to avert serious difficulties relating to fiber orientation. 1974 SA E Transactions 81</page><page sequence="41">740265-740272 740265. Techniques for Broadening the Capabilities of Polypropylene. Robert H. Heinold, Hercules Inc. New technology is presented illustrating how poly- propylene can be modified to broaden its structural capabilities beyond the limitations of present com- mercially available materials.

Electronically Controlled Semi- Automatic Trans- missions for Heavy-Duty Trucks. Gerald L. Myers, Spicer Transmission Div., Dana Corp. The driver of a heavy-duty vehicle with unsynchronized manual transmission has been required to make several precise movements in order to make a ratio change. Driver error during shifting, due to inexperience or carelessness, can cause damage to the transmission which increases maintenance cost. To overcome these problems in an efficient and economical manner, a system of controls has been added to a basic mechanical trans- mission which will complete the shift at the command of the driver. Electronic logic is used as a controlling media over an electropneumatic shifting system and an electro- mechanical synchronizing system. The various new com- ponents of the system and how they interract will be presented. 1974 SA E Transactions 740267. The Fiat-SRM Hydraulic Transmission - A Typical City Bus Application Employing an Electronic Control Unit. Franco Pinolini, Mon- tuschi Mario and Tasselli Vincenzo, Fiat S.p.A. The Fiat-SRM hydraulic transmission in a version suitable for city buses is described with regard to its basic features and to the different operational modes. The transmission uses a two-stage torque converter with fixed and rotating reactor, which provides two phases of hydraulic drive in the medium- and low-speed range. In the latter, the reaction torque on the reactor is added to the output torque by planetary gears, obtaining ex- ceptionally high ratios at the stall point. A third phase in direct mechanical drive is used in the high-speed range, using a clutch bypassing the converter. The different modes of operation are automatically controlled by an electronic unit, which is described with particular regard to its characteristics and to the possi- bility of obtaining high continuous decelerations on steep gradients, using the hydraulic braking offered by the transmission. 740268. A Look at European Developments in Truck Transmissions. W. M. Morrison, Turner Man- ufacturing Co., Ltd. (England). The object of this paper is to review developments taking place in Europe on truck transmission design. The existing design principles used in synchronized mechanical trans- missions are reassessed. A new approach where the main emphasis is given to synchronizer duty is described. The paper also discusses the logical extension of the use of stepped transmissions into semiautomatic versions and the possibilities of stepless transmissions. 740270. Using SAMMIE for Computer-Aided Workplace and Work Task Design. M. C. Bonney, K. Case, B. J. Hughes, D. N. Kennedy and R. W. Williams, University of Nottingham. The SAMMIE computer-aided workplace and work task design system is intended to facilitate the consideration of human factors within the design process from the conceptual, pre-mock-up stage of design onwards. The software consists of six main parts: a computerized man-model, a workplace modeling system, a language with which to describe the work tasks to be performed in that workplace, heuristic rules for workplace layouts, various measures of effectiveness which can aid the assessment of the suitability of the workplace, and finally a system for interactive man-machine communication. The workspace model and the model of the operator are displayed on a screen of an interactive graphics terminal and the workspace is then evaluated for an operator performing specified tasks. The dimensions and ar- rangements of the workspace, the dimensions of the operator, and to a lesser extent the work task may all be interactively changed, and the proposed design then reevaluated. Measures of effectiveness include reach, checks on visual suitability, and an evaluation of the methods and times required to perform the task. These, and other measures, may be used by the computer itself, and interactively under the designer's control. 740271. A Model of Reach Capabilities of Man. Henry Luming, Continental Can Co., Inc.; and Horst E. Krause, Research Institute, University of Dayton. A mathematical modeling technique for simulation of human motion is reviewed, and the technique is utilized to develop an approach to the analysis of reach. The modeling technique uses the Euler angles as geometric variables. The reach analysis approach involves the optimal location of intermediate joints to attain maximum reach. 740272. A Biomechanical Model for the Upper Extremity Using Optimization Techniques. M. M. Ayoub and Arun Walvekar, Texas Technological Uni- versity; and Mike Petruno, U. S. Air Force. A biomechanical model has been developed using dy- namic programming as a solution technique. The criterion selected for optimization is power-generated to perform a movement. The model predicts the position of the hand in space while performing simple movements, but the study indicates a need for more detailed considerations of model assumptions. However, the basic assumptions and the 82</page><page sequence="42">740272-740279 principles of theoretical mechanics used in dynamic analyses of man in motion continue to be valid and are not refuted by this study. 1974 SAE Transactions 740273. Development of a Model for Truck-Cab Design Based on Operator Task. Paul B. Young and G. F. Rabideau, University of Waterloo (Ontario). A methodology has been developed which is capable of generating design criteria for truck-cab control and display elements. The method combines driver behaviors determined by a task analysis with graphic theories of system interactions to analyze the influences of cab design features on safety-critical driver behavior. The end product of the method is a series of control and display categories, each containing the desirable design criteria of the category elements. All criteria and categories are assigned weighting factors to be used during "hard design" tradeoffs. 1974 SA E Transactions 740274. A Mathematical Study of the Effect of Nect Physical Parameters on Injury Susceptibility. D. H. Robbins, R. G. Snyder, D. B. Chaffin and D. Rę Foust, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The University of Michigan. Analytical man motion models have bee used to study how basic physical measurements may relate to suscep- tibility to cervical hyperextension-hyperflexion injury in an automobile collision. The parameters considered in the computer study are head-neck mass and moments of inertia, anthropometry, neck muscle strength, and loca- tion, as well as strength of motion-limiting "stops." In addition, related environmental parameters such as seat structural properties and crash acceleration pulse have been included. The data used with the computer program span the range of physcial and sexual variation in function and structure of the neck in a representative United States population and have been obtained in an extensive experimental program. Results are presented which attempt to relate injury susceptibility to physcial stature, age, and sex. 1974 SA E Transactions 740275. A Three-Dimensional Vehicle-Man Model for Collision and High Acceleration Studies. Ronald L. Huston, Richard Hessel and Chris Passerello, University of Cincinnati. The basic elements of a mathematical analysis of a three-dimensional vehicle (cockpit) - occupant simulation model are presented. The model employs Hanavan's finite segment human body model and possesses 31 degrees of freedom. The dynamical analysis is based upon Lagrange's form of d'Alembert's principle, which systematically provides for an efficient computer-oriented derivation of the governing dynamical equations of motion. The model possesses a broad range of appli- cation. An elementary study of a front-end collision is presented as an illustrative example. 740277. Consolidated Presentation of Fatigue Data for Design Applications. R. C. Rice and C. E. Jaske, Columbus Labs., Battelle Memorial Institute. Analytical methods have been developed to consolidate fatigue data for use in design of aerospace metallic structures. Fatigue data from constant-amplitude uni- axially loaded specimens of 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys, TÌ-6A1-4V alloy, and 300M steel were consolidated and statistically analyzed. An equivalent strain parameter was used to account for the influence of stress ratio on fatigue life. Notched-specimen data were consolidated by using a cyclic stress-strain approach to account for fatigue damage at the notch root. An arc-hyperbolic tangent function was used to relate the equivalent strain parameter to the common logarithm of fatigue life. After computing mean fatigue curves by least-squares regression, 90 and 99% lower-level tolerance curves were determined for a 95% level of confidence. These curves were constructed to represent a statistically based lower bound on fatigue life for any combination of strain amplitude, maximum stress, and stress-concentration factor within the defined bound- aries of the function. 1974 SA E Transactions 740278. A Cycle Counting Algorithm for Fatigue Damage Analysis. F. D. Richards and N. R. LaPointe, Ford Motor Co.; and R. M. Wetzel, Instron Corp. A cycle counting algorithm that will reduce a complex history into a series of discrete cycles is presented. The cycles determined by this technique are defined as closed stress-strain hysteresis loops of the type obtained from constant amplitude tests. Using the computer cycle counting algorithm, life predictions were made and compared with experimental results. These predictions were found to be typically within a ±3 factor of error. Also, the computer counting method was found to yield more accurate life predictions when compared to the histogram and range counting methods. 1974 SA E Transactions 740279. Proposed Technical Report on Fatigue Properties for the SAE Handbook. Lee E. Tucker, Deere &amp; Co., R. W. Landgraf, Scientific Res. Staff, Ford Motor Co.; and W. R. Brose, University of Illinois. A new section on fatigue properties of metals is currently being written under the guidance of the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee. This paper presents a preliminary copy of the proposed section which includes an introduction, a table of monotonie stress-strain properties, a table of cyclic stress-strain and fatigue properties, definitions of properties, and an example application. The main purpose of the paper is to provide engineers with the available data at the earliest possible time.

R. W. Landgraf and N. R. LaPointe, Ford Motor Co. Substantial improvements have been made in the accu- racy of component fatigue life predictions through the incorporation of cyclic stress-strain concepts in fatigue analysis procedures. This paper describes recent advances in material characterization, complex history analysis and notch analysis, and their application in computer-aided fatigue analysis procedures. A simplified strain-based approach, which offers conceptual and computational advantages, is then described and shown to be useful in many ground vehicle problems. Finally, several appli- cations of these techniques in engineering design practice are presented. 1974 SAE Transactions 740281. Waterjet Propulsion for High Speed Ships. M. I. Rudnicki and R. G. Sjogren, Aerojet Liquid Rocket Co. Waterjet propulsion and its optimization for modern water crafts were considered and some comparisons were made between waterjets and propellers. The waterjet optimization process presented includes considerations of inlet drag, weight of the propulsor, and the effect of the head and flow rate design parameters of the waterjet on the range of the craft. The waterjet/propeller comparison showed that the waterjet is the preferred propulsor in applications requiring high maneuverability, and appli- cations requiring shallow draft and immunity to water- borne debris. 1974 SAE Transactions 740282. Some Aspects of Water Jet Optimization. G. S. Wong and H. L. Barham, Rocketdyne Div./ Rockwell International. Recent developments in technology have contributed significantly to the selection of waterjets as a lightweight, efficient, and reliable propulsion system for high-speed planing crafts, hydrofoils, and surface effect ships (SES). The excellent takeoff thrust capability, simple arrange- ment with the engine and power transmission, low susceptibility to high-speed collision damage, and low water borne acoustics are some of the design features that have made the water jet an extremely attractive marine propulsion system. This paper describes the water jet optimization analysis necessary to achieve vehicle design thrust, speed, and range for a given gross weight with optimum propulsive efficiency, maximum obtainable payload, or minimum total propulsion system and fuel weights. The sensitivity of vehicle performance to water jet system parameters are identified. Significant tech- nology developments in the axial flow inducer pump that has led to its selection for the Jetfoil waterjet and for the SES water jet application are also described. 740283. Water Jet Propulsion - Competition for Pro- pellers? Ralph E. Lambrecht, Outboard Marine Corp. The increasing acceptance of water jet propulsion as an alternative to propeller drive in recreational size boats is evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the consumer. Comparative performance data for water jet and inboard-outboard propulsion units powered by identical engines installed in identical boats are presented. These include data on fuel mileage, speed, and accel- eration with various loads, engine rpm versus boat speed, and horsepower requirements. 740284. Practical Application of Water Jet Propulsion in Pleasure and Commercial Boats. Jack Seastrom, Jacuzzi Brothers Inc. A working knowledge of such factors as power-to-weight ratios, the effect of longitudinal center of gravity, differences in basic boat designs, and the limitations of water jet propulsion is mandatory for successful appli- cations of water jet propulsion in the pleasure and commercial boat markets. Field-tested formulas, rules, and tables are presented in this paper to reinforce these performance factors and to help both naval architects and less formally trained designers or boat builders to make wise installation decisions. 740285. Assuring Public Health Protection as a Result of the Mobile Source Emissions Control Program. John B. Moran, Environmental Protection Agency. Provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments are explained in this paper. Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen are specifically regulated emis- sions; fuels, fuel additives, and lubricants can be regu- lated, and a host of nonregulated emissions can be regulated on need. In examining these three categories of pollutants, the paper describes the health consequences of regulated and nonregulated emissions, the effects of various components on nonregulated emissions, and the effect of advanced control systems on regulated and nonregulated emissions. Finally, current EPA research on fuel and fuel additive registration, emissions characterization, health, and sur- veillance is discussed. 740286. Measurement of Vehicle Particulate Emissions. Morton Beltzer, Raymond J. Campion and William L. Petersen, Esso Research and Engi- neering Co. A constant volume sampler compatible auto exhaust particulate sampling system has been built and suc- cessfully operated. The system can be used to sample exhaust isokinetically at constant temperature, yields internally consistent results, and can be operated con- veniently and frequently. 84</page><page sequence="44">740286-740293 Studies with the sampling system have shown that vehicles equipped with oxidation catalysts convert some of the sulfur in the gasoline to sulfuric acid containing particulates. Bound water was shown to be a major component of the sulfuric acid exhaust particulate. Catalyst type and system design are believed to have a marked effect on the sulfuric acid conversion with additional research required to determine what features result in lower sulfate emissions. Emission tests have shown that platinum emission rates are lower than 2 X IO5 g/mile. More sensitive analytical techniques will be required to obtain infor- mation on a more quantitative basis. Short-term tests with NOx reduction catalysts have shown that the catalyst attrition rates can be readily measured. Discussion: G. M. Cornetti 1974 SA E Transactions 740287. Sulfuric Acid Aerosol Emissions from Catalyst- Equipped Engines. William R. Pierson, Robert H. Hammerle and Joseph T. Kummer, Ford Motor Co. It has been reported by Dow Chemical Co. that oxidation catalysts cause increased particulate emissions from automotive exhausts. We find that this particulate consists of aqueous H2S04 droplets. Current work undertaken between Ford and Battelle Columbus Labs., using an engine dynamometer, shows that the fuel sulfur emerges from the engine as S02. At 60 mph road load, a monolithic oxidation catalyst converts almost half of the S01d2 into S03, the bulk of which is emitted from the tailpipe as H2S04. The mass median diameter is smaller than 0.25 /im. Some ammonium sulfate is present, but the predominant sulfate species is H2S04, totalling some 40% of the gross particulate mass depending on humidity. The rest is primarily water, associated with the hygroscopic H2S04. Without a catalyst, the H2S04 is &lt;1/50 as much as with catalyst, the bulk of the fuel sulfur being emitted as S02.

Elastic fuel tanks have several advantages over those made of conventional sheet metal: greater flexibility of design which allows for better space utilization and increased fuel capacity, lower weight, absolute corrosion resistance, better thermal insulation, and improved safety performance. Made of a high-molecular, high-density polyethylene, the tanks can be produced by a variety of techniques. However, blow molding proved to be the most reliable and economic. Lengthy testing has proved that the tanks have long life, are resistant to fuel permeation, and are fire resistant. Because of its more efficient manufacture, the cost of the plastic tank is less than the sheet-metal one, even though the material costs are greater. Described are details of the manufacturing process and testing of the plastic tank. 740290. Problems of Using Plastics in the Car Industry. Rudolf Fernengel, Bavarian Motor Works. This paper discusses the necessity of careful testing in the design of plastic parts for automobiles. It gives specific details of tests on polypropylene plastic parts, such as radiator grilles, toolboxes, and fans. Microtome photo- graphs show details of good and poor connections of varied plastics when they are welded. Different types of plastic are discussed. 740291. Poly(amide-imide) Polymers - Properties, Pro- cessing Techniques, and Bearing Performance. R. H. Walker, Amoco Chemicals Corp. The properties offered by poly(amide-imide) molding resins allow design engineers to consider plastics for applications formerly considered too severe for polymers, and allow plastics to penetrate markets for fluid valves, bearings, gears, and other functional parts which, until this time, have primarily been the province of metals. In addition, these resins can offer a practical substitute for other plastics which must be replaced as the conditions under which they must perform exceed their inherent capabilities. 740292. Properties of Reinforced Propylene/ Acid Com- pounds. R. A. van Brederode, R. A. Steinkamp, K. W. Bartz, K. L. Trachte and D. G. Stenmark, Esso Research and Engineering Co. A new generation of glass fiber or asbestos filled propylene/acid copolymers is described in which the matrix resin adheres chemically to reinforcing filler. The adhesion results from the incorporation of the functional comonomer and produces enhanced physical properties of the composite even in pigmented parts. Other benefits of the adhesion include reduced wicking and reduced warpage of the molded object, improved surface gloss and reduced loss in physical properties due to glass fiber attrition during the compounding step compared to conventional polypropylene polymers. Compounding techniques for incorporating the glass fibers into the resin are discussed. 740293. Fracture Control Planning - Prerequisite to Structural Reliability. D. J. Baron, A. O. Smith Corp. An engineer-user point of view supporting the desirability of rational fracture control planning in critical structural designs is presented. The impending need for its consid- eration in future truck frame design is cited as an example. A general discussion of applicable fracture mechanics and fracture planning concepts is given. The application of these principles in the formulation of a fracture control philosophy for selection of steel for heavy truck frame fabrication is discussed. Data obtained from appropriate 85</page><page sequence="45">740293-740300 fracture tests of several truck frame steel compositions are given for exemplary purposes. 740294. Cab Isolation and Ride Quality. Michael J. Crosby and Rush E. Allen, Lord Kinematics, Lord Corp. Improved ride quality through cab isolation on tractor semitrailers is predicted. Analysis techniques, test data, and ride evaluation criteria are described which have been used to design cab isolation systems. Computer simu- lations of improved cab ride are presented for both conventional and cab-over-engine tractors. 1974 SA E Transactions 740295. Design Features and Initial Performance Data on an Automotive Steam Engine Part I - Overall Powerplant Description and Performance. L. C. Hoagland, R. L. Dernier and J. Gerstmann, Scientific Energy Systems Corp. The closed Rankine cycle steam powerplant is currently being reexamined as a low exhaust emission alternative to the gasoline spark ignition engine for use in automobiles and other transportation vehicles. This paper summarizes the progress to date on a program sponsored by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to develop an auto- mobile Rankine engine employing water as the working fluid and a 4-cyl uniflow reciprocating expander. Design details of the system are presented including a description of major components and packaging arrangements of the system in a six-passenger car. Results of development testing to date are presented illustrating that the exhaust emissions are well below the current 1977 federal standards and the fully condensing prototype system will be capable of performance and fuel economy substantially equal to current emission-con- trolled gasoline engine vehicles. 740296. Design Features and Initial Performance Data on an Automotive Steam Engine - Part II - Reciprocating Steam Expander - Design Fea- tures and Performance. W. D. Syniuta, Scientific Energy Systems Corp.; and R. M. Palmer, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927), Ltd. The paper describes the approach taken in the design and fabrication of a 4-cyl in-line trunk piston steam expander suitable for a standard six-passenger automobile. Series poppet admission valving is used with variable cutoff of steam to the expander attained by variable phasing of one camshaft with the aid of a hydraulically operated cam phasing mechanism. A specially formulated lubricant is used which allows expander operation with steam at 1000°F/1000 psig. Preliminary performance measurements for the ex- pander are presented and results are thought to be good considering the maturity of the system. Improvements to the expander which will result in increased efficiency are discussed. 740297. Automotive Organic Rankine-Cyle Powerplant - Design and Performance Data. P. Patel, E. F. Doyle, R. J. Raymond and R. Sakhuja, Thermo Electron Corp. An automotive powerplant using an organic Rankine- cycle engine has been designed, built, and tested in a preprototype configuration. A description of the system and results from expander, combustor, and preprototype system testing is presented. Emission results show that the system could meet the 1976 emission standards specified by Congress in the 1970 Clean Air Act. Performance and fuel consumption predictions are presented for a proto- type system based on both experimental and analytical results obtained to date. 740298. Turbine Rankine Cycle Automotive Engine De- velopment. J. N. Hodgson and F. N. Collamore, Aerojet Liquid Rocket Co. Aerojet Liquid Rocket Co. is evaluating the potential of the Rankine cycle engine as a low emission alternative to the internal combustion automotive engine. An organic fluid turbine engine has been designed, fabricated, and tested. A steam turbine engine is being prepared for vehicle road tests. Based upon fuel economy of 10 miles/gal, emissions less than one-fourth of 1975-1976 federal standards have been demonstrated. Performance equivalent to the internal combustion engine without exhaust emission controls appears feasible with further development. 740299. Consistency Study for Vehicle Deformation In- dex. J. Robert Cromack, Southwest Research Institute; and Scott N. Lee, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Dept. of Trans. In November 1970, an international program of accident investigation was undertaken by 33 teams representing nine European and North American nations. A stan- dardized protocol was formulated for collecting vehicle damage and occupant injury data. Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), as consultant to the project leader, collected a total of 520 case reports from these teams and reduced the common data to card images for automatic processing. The participating teams classified vehicle damage according to the Vehicle Deformation Index (VDI). A consistency study was performed to determine how well the diverse group of investigators, many with limited investigative training and/or experience, could use the VDI. One-half of the team ratings, excluding SwRI cases, compared identically with the control ratings; approx- imately 75% of the ratings compared identically or differed by only one character. A detailed report is made. 740300. Can an Automotive Designer Find Happiness with AIS? William L. Carlson, St. Olaf College. The abbreviated injury scale (AIS) is an ordinal measure of automotive occupant crash injury severity. This paper 86</page><page sequence="46">740300-740308 uses multiple regression analysis for empirically estimating expected AIS as a function of crash parameters. It is proposed that the estimated AIS provides a standardized measurement of crash severity. The difference between the actual crash severity and the standardized crash severity provides a measure of how well particular vehicle and/or road characteristics contribute to higher or lower injury severity. This procedure requires additional devel- opment with respect to improved measures of injury severity and application of the prediction procedure to specific crash analysis problems. 740303. Vehicle and Occupant Factors that Determine Occupant Injury. James F. Marquardt, Envi- ronmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. The actual injury incurred by a vehicle occupant in a given crash is determined by many factors. The large number and wide variation of these factors make it difficult to design widely effective vehicle safety features and to evaluate accident data. These factors can be classified into two groups: vehicle-related, which deter- mine the deceleration pulse applied to the occupant compartment and consequently the potential for injury; and occupant-related, which determine the actual injury incurred for a given injury potential. The relationships among the vehicle-related factors (velocities, masses, crush, and rebound characteristics) which determine injury potential are analyzed. It is shown that the injury potential can be estimated for actual crashes from some of the better defined vehicle-related factors. Computer-simulation results for injury-related criteria as a function of occupant-related factors over the range of injury potential of interest are given. The analysis results in conclusions applicable to many areas of automotive safety. 1974 SAE Transactions 740304. Symbol Study - 1972. Elizabeth A. Heard, International Organization for Standardization. The International Organization for Standardization, Technical Committee 22, Subcommittee 13, Working Group 5 was given the task of determining which symbols should be proposed for standardization for fifteen con- trols, indicators and telltales. A test was devised in which three different symbols for each given control, indicator or telltale could be appraised by licensed drivers in a simulated driving situation. Data from 2593 licensed drivers from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States were obtained and statistically treated. The procedure and results are herein reported. On the basis of these results, symbols for 12 controls, indicators, and telltales were proposed as standards. 740305. Automobile Damageability and Insurance Costs. Michael R. Appleby and Alan G. R. Morris, Automobile Club of Southern California. This paper concerns automobile damageability resulting from low-speed collisions. Both crash test and real collision data related to speed and repair costs are examined, as are current legislation and new engineering practices and hardware designed to reduce damage. Examination of the data led to several conclusions, among them that, contrary to widespread belief, manu- facturers are not building more fragile cars now. It was also found from crash test data that 1973 model cars will incur lower repair costs. Other consumer benefits and cost penalties are examined in detail. 1974 SAE Transactions 740306. Heavy Duty Truck Tandem Suspension for On/Off Highway Applications. Thomas H. Wat- son, Oshkosh Truck Corp. This paper describes the design, development, and testing of a heavy duty truck tandem suspension intended for vehicles that must operate both on and off the highway. The notable features of this suspension are a nonlinear spring rate, improved axle vertical travel, the wide span over which the suspension is mounted to the frame, and the ease with which the suspension accommodates different spacings between the tandem axles. 740307. Temperatures of Fluids in Passenger Car Power Trains. N. E. Gallopoulos, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The temperatures of engine oil, automatic transmission fluid, and differential lubricant were measured under a variety of steady-state conditions in 1969, 1971, 1972, and 1973 model year cars. Increases in engine speed and stroke and coolant temperature caused significant in- creases in engine oil temperatures. Engine load and coolant temperature increases appeared to be the principal causes of automatic transmission fluid temperature in- creases. Differential lubricant temperatures increased as engine speed and load increased, but speed was the more influential variable. The effect of ambient temperature was negligible in all cases over the narrow range of ambient temperatures investigated (65-85 °F). Analysis of the data for year-to-year trends showed that only engine oil temperatures increased from 1969 to 1973. This trend, and several observations of engine oil temperatures greater than 300° F, suggest that improved resistance of engine oils to oxidative thickening may be required. 740308. Automobile Fuel Economy with Hydromechanical Transmission by Simulation Studies. Eli Orshan- sky, Peter Huntley and William E. Weseloh, Orshansky Transmission Corp. In order to achieve greater fuel economy, it is desirable to operate the engine on a prescribed schedule of rpm and bmep for each load condition. To accomplish this, a continuously variable transmission is used to establish the proper ratio for each horsepower requirement, and this ratio has to vary continuously with variation of load 87</page><page sequence="47">740308-740316 imposed on the engine. A simulation study is made to show the fuel economy achieved with a hydromechanical transmission, as compared to a conventional automatic transmission. For comparison, both engine-transmission combinations were studied over identical city and sub- urban driving cycles, taking into account the losses in the transmissions, as well as the inertia of the components during acceleration and deceleration. The hydro- mechanical transmission is used in this study, because it presents a near-term solution to the fuel economy problems. All of the parts that make up such a transmission are well-known state-of-the-art components, thereby considerably reducing the required development time. 1974 SAE Transactions 740311. Computer Simulation Evaluation of Current U.S. and European Headlamp Meeting Beams, and a Proposed Mid Beam. Rudolf G. Mortimer and Judith M. Becker, Highway Safety Res. Inst., University of Michigan. A computer simulation of a nighttime meeting between two vehicles is described, including results showing the correspondence between predicted visibility distances and those obtained in field tests. The simulation is used to compare visibility distances and glare effects in meetings between vehicles equipped with the U.S. low beam, European low beam, and an experimental mid beam, in various conditions of aim. Results of this study suggest that differences between European and U.S. low beams are of little practical consequence. By comparison, the mid beam appears to offer a potentially improved meeting beam, pending resolution of problems of rearview mirror glare, beam switching, etc. 740312. Analysis of Sources of Error in Headlamp Aim. Paul L. Olson and Rudolf G. Mortimer, High- way Safety Res. Inst., The Univ. of Michigan. The literature on headlamp aiming is surveyed in detail to pinpoint the various sources and magnitudes of aim variance. Four major sources of variance are identified (differences between beam and mounting plane, pho- tometric changes in use, long axis alignment, and human factors) along with a number of others of lesser conse- quence. Illustrations are offered showing the expected population variance under a variety of conditions. It is apparent that, at the present state-of-the-art, a substantial percentage of the lamp population can be expected to be beyond the limits recommended in SAE J599c. It is further apparent that this would be true regardless of whether or not a vehicle inspection program is in operation. Recommendations are given regarding research em- nhasis in headliehtine.

Important new braking regulations for motor vehicles and trailers have recently been introduced by Sweden, the Economic Commission for Europe (Geneva), and the European Economic Community (Brussels). This paper describes the relevant rulemaking pro- cedures and the international organizations which provide for industry participation. The technical content of these regulations is summarized and specific examples of difficult, interesting, or unusual demands are highlighted. Some comparisons with the appropriate United States federal standards have been included and the European method of type approval is explained against the back- ground of self-certification in the United States. Several new European proposals for tractor/trailer compatibility, brake apportioning, and antiskid systems are reviewed to illustrate the current status of legislative progress in Europe. 1974 SAE Transactions 740314. Methods of Investigating Spark Timing and Its Scatter. M. J. Werson, E. M. Stafford and R. W. Todd, Department of Electronics, University of Southampton. The investigation into spark timing characteristics was carried out on a 2000 cm3 Ford Pinto engine mounted in a test cell. Autolite, Lumenition, and Bosch ignition systems have been investigated. Two methods of measurement of spark timing and timing scatter are proposed, and evaluated in terms of dynamic and static engine behavior. The relationships between mechanical and the electrical aspects of ignition are discussed, particularly with regard to contact breaker and optoelectronic firing. 740315. Further Developments in the Manufacture and Applications of Steel Chrome-Plated Cylinder Liners with Special Reference to Cavitation and Erosion Problems on the Water Side. J. Retolaza, Aplicaciones Industriales de Cromo Duro S.A. This paper describes a method of obtaining greater power in internal combustion engines, especially for industrial vehicles, by increasing the cylinder bore through the fitting of thin steel chrome-plated cylinder liners to substitute the heavier conventional cast iron liners. At the same time, these chrome-plated steel liners have a longer life due to the chrome coating and their adequate surface finish, both on normally aspirated and on supercharged engines. A comparative study is made of the resistance of steel and cast iron materials; furthermore, the problem of cavitation on the water side is examined and a well-proved solution is offered. the most significant sources are considered and rec- 740316. Occupant Protection in Car-to-Car Impacts. ommendations offered. Raymond G. Fischer, Engrg. Staff, General 88</page><page sequence="48">740316-740322 Motors Corp. An analytical study defines the interaction of the occupant and the vehicle as a system for car-to-car impacts. Using basic relationships, the question of vehicle stiffness and mass differential effects on the occupant is discussed. The vehicle characteristics used for the car-to-car impacts are developed from barrier impact data. 740317. (P-52) Survey of Solution Procedures for Non- linear Static and Dynamic Analyses. James A. Stricklin and Walter E. Haisler, Texas A&amp;M University. This paper presents a review of the solution techniques most widely used for solving the governing equations for static and dynamic, large deflection, elastic-plastic re- sponse of structures. For the transient response, one explicit direct integration method (central differences) and three implicit methods (Houbolt, Newmark Beta, and Wilson) are compared with respect to accuracy and stability. A modal superposition technique is developed and compared to the direct integration methods. It is concluded that the choice of a suitable method depends on the structure and loading involved and on the frequency response desired. For the static response, the available techniques are grouped according to whether they yield exact or approximate solutions to the nonlinear equations. The convergence characteristics for each method are summarized. Although it is concluded that the choice of methods depends on which type of nonlinearity (geometric or material) is most significant, the first-order self-correcting method is recommended as the best method overall for static problems. 1974 SA E Transactions 740318. (P-52) Elastic-Plastic Plate Bending with Con- stant Curvature Elements. Lawrence A. Larkin, A. O. Smith Corp. A constant curvature triangular plate bending element is developed for the elastic-plastic bending of laterally loaded plates. First, a constant curvature element is developed which eliminates the mid-side degrees of freedom found in elements of previous investigations. Next, the convergence of this modified constant curvature element to elastic theoretical results is demonstrated for several plates. Finally, this element is used to predict the elastic-plastic behavior of these plates. Good agreement is indicated with the collapse load for ideally plastic plates. 1974 SA E Transactions 740319. (P-52) Finite Element Analysis of Automobile Structures. Robert J. Melosh, MARC Analysis Research Corporation. The structure of an automobile offers a formidable challenge to the analyst who wishes to predict its response using numerical methods and the digital computer. Accurate representation of geometry, materials, and boundary conditions with discretized models may be an intrinsically uneconomic objective compared with phys- ical testing in most practical applications. This paper reviews the success of efforts to predict linear static, dynamic, and nonlinear transient behavior of car components and structural systems. It relates the analysis of accuracy to essential features of car structure. It shows how these features, the existing level of quality control of structural characteristics during fabrication and assembly and the complexity of geometry, conspire to make accurate simulation using current practices un- necessarily costly, in dollars and time. It reviews work currently being done to justify broader use of numerical methods in the industry. 1974 SA E Transactions 740320. (P-52) Finite Element Structural Analysis as Applied to an Automotive Door Structure. S. W. Park and F. W. DuVall, Ford Motor Co. Structural problems encountered in engineering design tend to be inherently complex in nature. Establishing the structural idealization which approximates the true struc- ture constitutes a prime problem. Finite Element Struc- tural Analysis leads to better results than current classical practices because it permits a more accurate represen- tation of the true structure. The objective of this study was to determine if finite element structural analysis can provide meaningful struc- tural design predictions within the allotted design cycle and provide better designs at reduced costs. Application was made to a door structure. Various techniques were developed covering analytical modeling of complex structures and automated input data generation and output data interpretation using the graphic system. The results of the study show finite element structural analysis, when used with an interactive graphic system, can be used successfully as a powerful design tool for automobile body components. 1974 SA E Transactions 740321. (P-52) An Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis of the Mechanical and Thermal Stresses in Brake Drums. P. A. Fensel, Dayton-Walther Corp. A linear elastic finite element analysis of brake drums is presented. The axisymmetry is assumed for the geometry of the structure; however the loads may be arbitrary. Laboratory measurements of the mechanical stresses support the computational analysis. 740322. (P-52) Application of Finite Element Methods to Complete Automobile Structural Design Evalu- ation. K. H. Wadleigh, Chrysler Corp. The need for minimum complexity models of complete body/chassis structures is discussed. Calculations of deflections, loads, and stresses resulting from load applications to this type of model are presented. Com- parisons with similar though not exact actual vehicle test results are presented.

(P-52) Static Analysis Via Substructuring of an Experimental Vehicle Front-End Body Structure. L. I. Nagy, Ford Motor Co. A static analysis of the front-end structure of an experimental vehicle which identified the high stress areas is presented in this paper. NASA Structural Analysis (NASTRAN), a finite element computer program, was used for the analysis. The size of the mathematical model was large (17,000 degrees of freedom); therefore, substructuring techniques were utilized. Procedures pertinent to NASTRAN sub- structuring are described, and the theoretical relationships are summarized. Interpretation of results, comparison between analytical and experimental results, as well as computer cost and manpower requirements, are also discussed. 740324. (P-52) The Use of Elastic-Plastic Finite Element Analysis in the Calculation of Cumulative Fatigue Damage. G. E. Barron, A. O. Smith Corp. A NASTRAN elastic-plastic finite element analysis of a notched fatigue specimen was performed and the results compared with experimental notch root strain. The calculated notch stress and strain were used in a cumulative damage procedure for determining specimen life which was compared to experimental fatigue life for three different loading spectrums for a Man-Ten steel material. The finite element analysis shows promise in replacing the full scale testing of prototypes now required to determine notch factors. Fatigue prediction from the drawing board could allow redesign of critical areas before expensive prototypes are built. 1974 SA E Transactions 740325. (P-52) The Computation of Tearing Energy of Nicked Rubber Strips in Extension. Hilario L. Oh and Neng-Ming Wang, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. To compute the tearing energy of nicked rubber strips in extension, one has to solve first the associated stress- deformation involving finite elasticity. In the past, this was a formidable task so that the tearing energy had been determined solely by experiments and only for a few testpieces. With the aid of the finite element method (FEM), it is shown that this may now be done simply through the use of the Rice's J integral. Tearing energy for two testpieces are computed and results compared with existing experimental data. The agreement is good. Because of FEM's ability to treat general geometric and loading conditions, the use of the J integral in combi- nation with FEM to compute the tearing energy now allows a wider application of the tearing energy concept to more complex units than hitherto known. 1974 SA E Transactions 740326. (P-52) NASTRAN for Dynamic Analysis of Vehicle Systems. Wayne A. McClelland and Albert L. Klosterman, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. In general, the dynamic analysis of vehicle systems has been an extremely difficult task. However, the emergence of sophisticated finite element programs such as NAS- TRAN and computer interfaced testing equipment has created a new dimension in the analysis of vehicle dynamics. This paper describes an approach to the dynamic analysis of vehicle systems which takes advan- tage of pre-processor programs, NASTRAN, post-proc- essor programs and computer interfaced testing equip- ment to perform an efficient vehicle dynamic analysis. The technique uses a building block approach to the analysis of the vehicle system which allows for the overall analysis to be determined from the dynamic performance of various subsystems. The dynamic characteristics of the subsystems are determined by various computer codes and experimental investigations. 1974 SA E Transactions 740327. (P-52) An Interactive Hybrid Technique for Crashworthy Design of Complex Vehicular Struc- tural Systems. Kenneth J. Saczalski, Department of the Navy; and Kwang C. Park, Lockheed- California Co. An interactive hybrid technique has been investigated as a feasible method for allowing the designer a means to predict failure modes and general crashworthiness re- sponse of complex multi-degree of freedom structural systems, such as the automotive vehicle, without the necessity of innumerable, costly destructive tests. The technique employs average internal energy of deformable elements and internal reaction load density spectrums, with a simplified yield and buckling criterion, as the mechanism for predicting collapse modes of the shock excited system containing large arbitrary shaped rigid bodies which are linked by structural elements, composed of nonlinear, rate-sensitive, materials. Incre- mental finite element approximations account for the system nonlinearities in critical regions, identified by the predicted collapse mode, so as to allow judicious modeling of the system. By predicting where and in what manner failure is most likely to occur, the technique provides a simplified analytical type tool to aid in the crashworthy design of a broad class of shock excited structural configurations with general constraints. An outline of the technique, along with results of preliminary investigations are given. Relationships to the present state of knowledge in the field regarding analytical techniques for crashworthy design are discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740328. (P-52) Power Spectral Density Analysis of Vehicle Vibration Using the NASTRAN Com- puter Program. L. J. Howell, Research Labs., 90</page><page sequence="50">740328-740333 General Motors Corp. Frequency response and power spectral density analyses are implemented on the N ASTR AN computer program for the purpose of assessing the vibratory response of automotive vehicles. A review of theoretical concepts related to the frequency domain techniques is presented, followed by a derivation of the equations of vertical motion for a linearly elastic automotive vehicle. Special emphasis is given to the discussion of random loading, and the cross-spectral density matrix for the terrain input to a four-wheel vehicle is derived. Example calculations are performed for a compact-size vehicle exposed to moderately severe road roughness. 1974 SAE Transactions 740329. (P-52) A Modal Synthesis Technique for De- termining Dynamic Properties for a Structure for Mass and Stiffness Changes. Curtis F. Vail, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The assembly and particularly the reduction of the mass and stiffness matrix for a large system can be a significant portion of the computational cost of finding the mode shapes and natural frequencies. Therefore, parameter studies for design purposes can be prohibitive if these matrices are reassembled and reduced for each change. The purpose of this paper is to outline the procedure for using the modes of the original system to determine the dynamic characteristics of the changed system. The method also results in computational savings for bound- ary condition changes and for large systems that are nearly-symmetric except for a few mass and stiffness changes. To illustrate the method several changes are made to a ladder frame. The results from an analysis using the reconstructed mass and stiffness matrices and the modal synthesis technique are compared to show the accuracy and freedom requirements. 1974 SAE Transactions 740330. (P-52) The Use of Condensation Techniques for Solving Dynamics Problems. Mark F. Nelson, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The advent of large computer systems for structural analysis has sometimes led to the use of little-understood approximation techniques which can lead to undetected errors. For example, for dynamic analysis, only dynamic degrees of freedom at the points of significant mass and moment of inertia are needed, which allows a large degree of freedom problem to be condensed to a more man- ageable, smaller size. This paper explains the theory behind such condensation techniques, illustrates their use, and outlines numerical techniques for efficiently gener- ating the condensed equations. Three examples of con- densation are given to illustrate the approximation involved and the error that can be expected. 1974 SAE Transactions 740331. (P-52) A User-Oriented Program for Crash Dynamics. Richard N. Karnes, James D. Sebas- tian, James L. Tocher and David W. Twigg, Boeing Computer Services, Inc. This paper describes the conversion of a crash analysis program from its original batch program form with awkward input to an efficient, user-oriented interactive tool. The program simulates a vehicle occupant with a two dimensional, seven link mathematical model re- strained by a seat belt and shoulder harness. A nonlinear finite element capability was added to enable modeling of a seat which would interact realistically with the occupant. A new differential equation solver was developed which achieved a sixty per cent reduction in the computer time required for the transient response analysis. The modified program incorporates user aids such as free-field data input and an on-line data edit capability. Output was reformatted to provide user-selected time history and occupant configuration plots as well as readable printout. 740332. (P-52) The Role of Finite Deformation Analysis in Plane Stress and Strain Fractures. Ali Youssef and Leslie G. Jaeger, University of New Bruns- wick (Canada). A full nonlinear analysis, geometric as well as constitutive, of cracked plates in plane stress and strain is given. The theory is formulated in a Lagrangian frame of reference. The Newton-Rahpson method is used to solve for generalized displacements in the resulting nonlinear equilibrium equations. An elastic-perfectly plastic behav- ior is assumed. An example of a plate containing a sharp crack and subjected to tensile load is solved using a developed finite element computer program. The analysis reveals the extent to which linear elastic-plastic approximation can be used with confidence. The inclusion of changes of large geometry results in higher and more intense strains directly ahead of the crack tip. Also a limited value of stress is achieved in the near crack tip zone. In general, the full nonlinear analysis presents a better representation of ductile fracture mechanisms than does linear elastic- plastic analysis. 740333. (P-52) Elasto-Plastic Analysis of Stress in a Gas-Turbine Wheel. Sing C. Tang and Robert C. Petrof, Scientific Res. Staff, Ford Motor Co. This paper is concerned with the development of a finite element method for the elas to-plastic analysis of a gas turbine wheel under severe thermal and mechanical loads. A computer program based upon this development has been written and checked by running sample problems for which the solutions exist in the literature. The output of the computer program gives the transient displacements and stresses for a specified set of discrete points in the structure. As an illustration of an actual application, one power turbine wheel has been analyzed by using the developed method and running the checked computer program. The method developed in this paper should serve as a useful tool in turbine wheel design and should 91</page><page sequence="51">740333-740339 result in improved wheel designs and extended engine durability. 1974 SAE Transactions 740334. (P-52) Large Displacement, Nonlinear Transient Analysis by Finite Elements. T. Belytschko, University of Illinois at Chicago; R. E. Welch and R. W. Bruce, IIT Research Institute. A method is presented for the transient analysis of structures including nonlinearities in material behavior and geometry. A system of rigid convected (or coro- tational) coordinates that rotate and translate with each element is used to simplify the governing equations so that an efficient computer code could be developed. For purposes of applying the method to problems with moderately large relative rotations within an element, this paper introduces additional terms to account for these variations of the rotation. Results are presented for a variety of elastic and elastic-plastic problems. 1974 SA E Transactions 740335. (P-52) Stiffness Analysis of Sheet Metal Shells under Concentrated Loads. Kuo-Kuang Chen, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and David S. Fine, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The objective of this paper is to study the applicability of the finite element method in calculating both small and large deflections of sheet metal shells subject to concen- trated loads in the elastic range. In the small deflection case, three types of elements - the Hsieh-Clough-Tocher triangular plate element, the Felippa quadrilateral plate element, and the Dupuis triangular shell element - are used to calculate the stiffness of two simple panels (a sectional circular cylinder and a paraboloid) and a spherical cap. The calculated results show that all three elements give solutions converging to the exact shell solutions. Using meshes of 300-500 degrees of freedom, the errors of the finite element results relative to the exact values are about 5% or less. For the spherical cap, existing experimental data is also included in the comparison study. For large deflections, load-displacement curves of the spherical cap are computed for deflections up to three shell thicknesses using the Dupuis element. Measured data show that the departure of the load-displacement curve from the linear extrapolation based on its initial slope is substantial for deflections greater than one shell thickness (40% or more reduction in load). Using meshes of several hundred degrees of freedom for a quarter of the cap and several load increment sizes, the calculated results compare reasonably well with measured data both in trend and in magnitude. 1974 SA E Transactions 740336. (P-52) Application of Grid Selection Procedures for Improved Finite Element Stress Analysis. D. J. Turcke, Queens University (Canada); and G. M. McNeice, University of Waterloo (Canada). This paper presents a set of procedures that the stress analyst can use in laying out a finite element grid such that a near optimum mesh of elements will result. These grids lead to marked improvement in the displacement and stress estimates, especially in high gradient regions. Examples are given of direct application to problems encountered in automotive stress analysis. 1974 SAE Transactions 740337. (P-52) Diesel Engine Component Design Using the Finite Element Method and Interactive Graphics. J. M. Fleming and M. J. Percy, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. An inexpensive, flexible and convenient finite element analysis system can be implemented with limited capital and resources. A system of this nature can be a functional tool of the designer and stress analyst for the analysis of many types of mechanical components. The finite element models generated by this system can approach a high degree of complexity with a small time investment compared to the time required to do this job without the aid of the system described. 1974 SAE Transactions 740338. (P-52) Finite Element Analysis, an Automobile Engineer's Tool. D. Radaj, A. Zimmer and H. Geissler, Daimler-Benz AG (Germany). The finite element method as a modern technique for the automobile engineer will become fully effective provided that all its possibilities and requirements are taken into account. As a basic prerequisite for such a development, the importance of computer analysis, experimentation and mechanical design are illustrated and expectations with regard to finite element programming systems are shown, coupled with explanations covering the verification of the finite element method and its qualified use as an absolutely necessary prerequisite for success. Systems used or taken into consideration by Daimler-Benz are critically reviewed and some successful computer projects conducted are presented. 1974 SAE Transactions 740339. (P-52) A Technique for Connecting Beam Ele- ments to a Plate Model of a Complicated Box Section. Dennis D. Schwerzler, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. In automobile structures some box sections cannot be adequately defined using beam finite elements. These sections require detailed plate models to represent holes and rapid changes in cross sections. Complications arise in connecting these detailed sections to those sections that can be adequately defined using beam elements. This paper shows one technique for connecting the two sections together. An example of this technique is demonstrated on a section of an automobile frame, and the results are compared to experimental data. 92</page><page sequence="52">740340-740345 740340. (P-52) The Flexibility of a Tubular Welded Joint in a Vehicle Frame. James L. Lubkin, Michigan State University and Ford Motor Co. Automotive frames frequently consist of thin-tube mem- bers thick enough for much of the structure to be modeled adequately by bar elements. However, previous results show that a typical welded joint cannot be handled by the classical "rigid joint" assumption of frame analysis. Those results include tests of a joint type common in passenger car frames, and establish errors of over 60% in analytical predictions for some of the lower natural frequencies. The present paper attempts to see how much improvement we can achieve by simply accounting for the actual tubular shape in the vicinity of the joint, without allowing for the flexibility of the weld line itself. The study uses the NASTRAN computer program. The joint region is treated as a small substructure in a model otherwise composed of bar elements. This procedure is economical because only those portions which really have to be analyzed using plate elements are so treated. Parameters investigated include joint length, and two ways of attaching a shell to adjacent bar elements. The present results reduce the worst two frequency errors, 38% and 60%, to less than 7% and 11%, respectively. This is good enough for many purposes. Residual discrepancies are believed to be due, in part, to actual weld line flexibility. In vibration modes involving a particular kind of bending deformation, the slightly larger discrepancies are also tentatively attributed to a nonlinear effect, that is, changes of cross-section shape in the relatively thin rectangular tubing used. 1974 SAE Transactions 740341. (P-52) Finite Element Model Data Checkout with Interactive Graphics. A. Wotiz, Ford Motor Co. Features of an interactive graphics computer program which provides structural analysts with a method of inspecting and correcting the input data for a large structural analysis computer program are discussed. The structure defined by the input data is displayed on a high-speed graphics display and can be viewed in dynamic rotation, studied at a large scale, tested for correct definition, and corrected when errors are detected. The program has been found to be a great aid in correcting and verifying input data and has considerably reduced the time and cost of data preparation. 1974 SAE Transactions 740342. (P-52) Generation of Finite Element Models via Computer Graphics. David J. Fawcett, Ford Motor Co. The objective of this paper is to illustrate an interactive computer graphics program developed to simplify the creation of finite element data which will be used for computerized structural analysis. Three-dimensional, part definition data in the form of basic design lines is input to the program and displayed on a cathode ray tube, and then a structural engineer creates the finite element definition using various computer graphics techniques. The procedures involved are dis- cussed in detail, as well as the advantages over the traditional manual approach to element generation. Actual experience has demonstrated that this interactive computer graphic approach, in addition to being both accurate and reliable, is approximately fifteen times faster than the tedious manual method. 1974 SAE Transactions 740343. (P-52) NASTRAN Plotting at a Remote Ter- minal. J. J. Soboleski, A. O. Smith Corp. A system has been developed for obtaining NASTRAN plots using a plotter at a remote terminal. This provides the NASTRAN user with a convenient way to use the plotting capability of NASTRAN. 740344. (P-52) Using Interactive Graphics for the Prep- aration and Management of Finite Element Data. R. K. Leverenz, B. L. Ng and W. D. Birchler, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; A. R. Periard and L. Esselink, Mfg. Staff, General Motors Corp. Interactive graphics is an aid which eliminates the data management problems that arise when manually prepar- ing finite element models. Line and surface data repre- sentations of sheet metal automotive stampings are displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT), and these data are then used for building finite element models. Elements are built by creating node points with the light pen or by using automatic mesh generating techniques. By using the interactive capability, the user immediately sees the results of his modeling decisions and can make changes in his model as a result of viewing his work. The interactive graphics system allows the user to define his elements, load cases, boundary conditions, and freedom sets without worrying about the grid point or element numbers. All information is communicated through the use of either the light pen or the keyboard. As information is supplied about the model, it is stored in a data base for review and possible change. After the structure is complete, the data base is processed and the information is formatted for either of three finite element codes. Use of interactive graphics has helped to produce low error data at a rate not possible by manually modeling from blueprint data. 1974 SAE Transactions 740345. The National Microwave Landing System (MLS). Jack W. Edwards, Federal Aviation Administration. The microwave landing system (MLS) is being developed as the next generation approach and landing system to replace the present worldwide instrument landing system (ILS). In order to satisfy diverse users such as civil and military aviation and conventional and V/STOL aircraft, 93</page><page sequence="53">740345-740351 the MLS employs compatible modular configurations. The five-year National MLS Development Program, half over, has just completed a hardware feasibility demon- stration phase, is about to choose the best technique, either scanning beam or Doppler scan, and in the next phase will select a single national system from among competing contractors. Meanwhile, the International Civil Aviation Organization has initiated a program directed toward the selection of a new "nonvisual approach and landing system." The United States is one of five member countries proposing candidates for international stan- dardization. Operational advantages provided by the MLS include far greater flying precision and flexibility, in- cluding curved or segmented approaches in three dimen- sions; and flare guidance for all-weather automatic landing capability, resulting in greater safety while increasing airport capacities. At the same time, on a compatible basis, the economic and performance needs of general aviation are being satisfied. 740346. System Integration in Business Aircraft Avionics. A. K. Wohlers, Sperry Rand Corp. There is an increasing need for improved efficiency in flight operations of business aircraft while preserving the operational flexibility that is essential to the business aircraft mission. The growing complexity of the air traffic control environment coupled with new regulatory de- mands has spawned the development of new avionic devices to meet the new requirements. These devices must be integrated into the avionic equipment complex in a manner that fits the normal pattern of pilot activity and does not increase his workload. The operational inte- gration will result in less overall avionic system com- plexity, fewer interface compatibility problems, improved reliability, and lower cost of ownership. 740347. Simulation and Flight Evaluation of a Heads-Up Display for General Aviation. Randall L. Harris, Sr., NASA Langley Research Center. A landing-site indicator (LASI) has been devised as a relatively simple heads-up display to show the pilot the magnitude and direction of the airplane's velocity vector superimposed over the pilot's view of the landing area. A total of 160 landings were performed in a fixed-base simulation program by four pilots with and without the LASI display. These tests showed the display to be of beneficial use in making the approaches more consistent. Some inferences were also made that the physical workload would also be less with its use. The pilots generally agreed that the LASI, as represented in the simulation was a useful landing aid. Additional pilot comments from preliminary flight tests of a breadboard LASI display unit tend to confirm the simulator results. The LASI unit might also be useful as a training device for student pilots; however, specific tests would have to be performed to verify this possibility. 740348. A Unique Approach to the Development of a Light Helicopter Automatic Flight Control Sys- tem. Donald R. Korte, The Bendix Corp.; and Robert Bakotich, The Enstrom Corp. The requirements and implementation of the Enstrom Cruise-A-Long flight control system are described. This includes a review of the need for better helicopter stability, in terms of pilot work load, and separation of maneuverability from stability. The flight control system configuration is defined with block diagrams, hardware implementation, actuation analysis, and failure monitoring. System interface with aircraft performance characteristics, along with flight test results, are highlighted. 740349. A Simplified Criterion to Certify Light Aircraft for Flight in Icing Conditions. David H. Gollings, Piper Aircraft Corp.; and Dennis W. Newton, Pennsylvania State University. General aviation aircraft are, for the most part, prohibited from operating in icing conditions even when equipped with ice protection systems. This prohibition exists primarily because the FAA imposes transport category certification conditions on all categories of aircraft, and there is presently no appropriate alternative. This paper outlines the evolution and application of a method of substantiation which was proposed to the FAA as a more realistic basis for certification of light airplanes in icing conditions. The paper is presented in two parts: a discussion of the method and its application to the Piper Seneca flight test program. 740350. A Study of Light Airplane Pilot Landing Per- formance. T. C. O'Bryan, M. W. Goode and R. L. Harris, NASA Langley Research Center. The results of a total of 289 landings performed with a low wing airplane by a group of private pilots on a long and short runway have been analyzed to determine the landing performance of these pilots. Both the long and short runway landings show significant variation from straight or uniformly curved trajectories, denoting considerable "jockeying" on the part of the pilot during approach. Considerable float followed by touchdown at speeds well above stall were noted. The short runway landings were quite similar except that approach speeds were slightly lower as a result of the use of two-thirds to full flaps, and touchdown occurred closer to the threshold. 740351. Applications of Fluidics to Light Aircraft In- strumentation and Control. H. D. Garner, Lang- ley Research Center, NASA. This paper reviews NASA/Langley's program for the development of advanced fluidic components and the application of these components to general aviation instrumentation and control. The major project in this category has been the development of a simple, reliable, two-axis autopilot for light aircraft, using a fluidic inertial 94</page><page sequence="54">740351-740361 rate sensor for stability and roll attitude control, and a simple magnetometer for azimuth reference. This auto- pilot has been successfully flight tested. Fluidic hardware developed for this autopilot is described, and projected improvements and extensions are discussed. Application of fluidic components to such flight instruments as turn coordinators, artificial horizons, and true airspeed indi- cators is explored. 740352. NASA General Aviation Research Overview. Joseph W. Stickle, Langley Research Center, NASA; Roger L. Winblade and Judy A. West- fall, NASA Headquarters. An overview of current NASA research programs directly focused on general aviation is presented. Significant accomplishments are cited in the areas of airfoil research, stall/spin technology, crashworthiness, and propulsion noise and efficiency. Highlights of recent NASA organ- izational developments affecting general aviation research are outlined. 740353. Light Aircraft Crash Safety Program. R. G. Thomson and R. J. Hayduk, NASA Langley Research Center. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have joined forces in a General Aviation Crashworthiness Program. This paper describes the research and devel- opment tasks of the program which are the responsibility of NASA. NASA is embarked upon research and development tasks aimed at providing the general aviation industry with a reliable crashworthy airframe design technology. The goals of the NASA program are: reliable analytical techniques for predicting the nonlinear behavior of structures; significant design improvements of airframes; and simulated full-scale crash test data. The analytical tools will include both simplified procedures for esti- mating energy absorption characteristics and more com- plex computer programs for analysis of general airframe structures under crash loading conditions. The analytical techniques, being developed both in-house and under contract, are described and the comparison of some analytical predictions with experimental results is shown. 740354. Stall/Spin Research Status Report. James S. Bowman, Jr. and Sanger M. Burk, Jr., NASA Langley Research Center. This paper presents the scope of an NASA program aimed at improving the design and evaluation techniques relative to stall/spin characteristics of general aviation aircraft. The program encompasses analytical studies, full-scale and model wing-tunnel tests, radio-control model, and full-scale flight tests. Initial spin-tunnel results of several tail designs on a representative light airplane is discussed. The most significant results of tests indicated that an improvement in the recovery characteristics may not necessarily be obtained by increasing the tail damping power factor by raising the horizontal tail position, and that the addition of a ventral fin usually gives only a small improvement in recovery characteristics. Both tail damp- ing ratio and unshielded rudder volume coefficient are important for good tail configurations for spin recovery. 740358. Crash-Resistant Fuel Tanks for Helicopters and General Aviation Aircraft. H. D. Smith, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Crashworthy fuel tanks have been developed for U.S. Army helicopters which have demonstrated excellent performance in over three years of service. Although design guidelines evolving from this work have a direct bearing on the application of crashworthy fuel cells for general aviation aircraft, additional devel- opment work is required to provide tanks with minimum cost and weight penalties. 1974 SA E Transactions 740359. A Quiet Propeller for Commuter and General Aviation Aircraft. W. B. Harlamert, Hartzell Propeller, Inc. An aircraft propeller with five blades has been developed for application on relatively high horsepower turbine engines. This propeller is capable of absorbing high horsepower at low engine rpm to effect a low propeller noise emission. Propeller performance remains satisfactory, as its design is intended for a commuter type aircraft. Struc- turally, the addition of a blade has not created serious design problems. For its intended application, the five-blade best satisfies the requirement for a "quiet" propeller. It is doubtful if the addition of more blades would be desirable. 740360. Evaluation of Aircraft Internal Noise. Narayanan Ganesan, Gates Learjet Corp. From the standpoint of marketing as well as safety, control of aircraft interior noise is of considerable interest to the manufacturers of business aircraft. The interior acoustics engineer in the industry, having no fund of accumulated experience or research to draw from in the industry itself, has to piece together a working design procedure from a knowledge of boundary-layer theory, jet noise, random vibrations, and architectural acoustics to meet an acceptable cabin noise criterion for the small aircraft. In this paper, methods are outlined to calculate the cabin noise level due to the three main noise sources - the boundary-layer pressure fluctuations, jet exhaust, and internal equipment. Formulas for quick estimation of overall noise levels due to these sources as well as methods to obtain octave band levels are given. The paper also discusses manufacture or service-related noises and methods for identifying their sources. 740361. The Background to Propeller Airplane Noise Regulations. Edmund W. Sellman, Federal Avi- ation Administration. 95</page><page sequence="55">740361-740371 The objective of this report is to outline the development of noise standards applicable to light, propeller-driven aircraft. The new noise abatement standards required under the Noise Control Act of 1972 are discussed in regard to their impact on future aircraft designs and their economic effect on the general aviation industry. Since no type certification requirements for noise abatement currently existed for propeller-driven aircraft (other than for those in the transport category), it was necessary to set up a testing procedure to determine how the standards could be modified for such aircraft. Discussed in detail are the noise evaluation measures, testing procedures, and maximum noise level standards. 740362. The Variation of Noise Footprint with Propeller Characteristics. Thomas L. Galloway, Ames Research Center, NASA. The potential for reducing the noise footprint area of general aviation aircraft through propeller and engine modifications while maintaining good aircraft perform- ance is investigated. The analysis considers propeller changes on representative single- and twin-engine designs and the use of geared engines on the twin design. A reduced diameter, four-bladed propeller was attractive for both designs, and the potential exists for reducing footprint area by an order of magnitude for the geared engine twin. 740365. A Fowler Flap System for a High-Performance General Aviation Airfoil. W. H. Wentz, Jr. and H. C. Seetharam, Wichita State University. As part of a general aviation airfoil development program being carried out under the direction of the NASA Langley Research Center, a 30% chord Fowler flap has been developed for the GA(W)-1 airfoil. Wind tunnel tests at Wichita State University have demonstrated a clmax value of 3.80 for 40 deg flap deflection at a Reynolds number of 2.2 X 106. Effects of flap slot geometry have been systematically tested and optimum flap settings for any flight cx have been obtained. Modifications of the reflexed lower surface contour resulted in a reduced clmax with flap nested. Vortex generators provided an increase in clmax of 0.2 for flap nested and 40 deg flap along with a drag penalty at low Cj values. Flow visualization studies show that the stalling patterns for the new airfoil are characterized by an absence of leading edge separation for both the flap-nested and the 40 deg flap cases. 740366. Low-Speed Aerodynamic Characteristics of a 13.1 Percent-Thick, High-Lift Airfoil. Kenneth R. Sivier, Allen I. Ormsbee and Randal W. Awker, University of Illinois. This paper is concerned with the experimental study of the low-speed, sectional characteristics of a high-lift airfoil and the comparison of those characteristics with the predictions of the theoretical methods used in the airfoil's design. The 13.1% thick, UI-1720 airfoil was found to achieve the predicted maximum lift coefficient of nearly 2.0. No upper-surface, flow separation was found below the stall angle of attack of 16 deg; it appeared that stall was due to an abrupt leading-edge flow separation. 740368. Flight Test Results for an Advanced Technology Light Airplane Wing. David L. Kohlman, Flight Res. Lab., University of Kansas. Filght test results are reported for a Cessna Cardinal single-engine light airplane modified by the installation of advanced technology wings incorporating reduced area, Fowler and Kruger flaps, and spoilers for roll and flight path control. Comparisons with the unmodified airplane show increased cruise speeds, smoother ride in turbulence, and major increases in maximum lift coefficient. Excel- lent roll control is achieved with spoilers. Several design features incorporated in the new wings show considerable promise for incorporation in future light airplanes. 740369. Flight Test Results of a Separate Surface Wing- Leveling System. J. Roskam, Roskam Aviation and Engineering Corp. A wing-leveler system using a separate surface aileron driven by a linear electro-mechanical actuator is being developed for a Cessna 172. The separate surface aileron is installed in the left wing only. Flight tests indicate that the system performs the bank angle hold function quite well for a wide range of bank angles. After hardover failures of the system, the pilot still has adequate control over the airplane. Takeoffs and landing with the system failed hardover have been performed. The system can be retrofitted to existing airplanes. 740370. T-Tail Aerodynamics of the Super King Air. R. R. Tumlinson and H. L. Walter, Beech Aircraft Corp. The Super King Air Model 200 is Beech Aircraft's latest entry into the executive turboprop airplane market. Principal design features include a T-tail empennage and 850 SHP PT6A-41 powerplants widely spaced on a high-aspect-ratio wing. This paper presents a discussion of the preliminary studies of the T-tail and the results of preliminary wind tunnel tests. The rationale and design philosophy for satisfactory stall characteristics are dis- cussed; and the development wind tunnel tests, the flight simulator tests, and the development flight-test program are reviewed. 740371. A Digital Simulation Technique for Crashworthy Analysis of Aircraft Seats. David H. Laananen, Ultrasystems, Inc. A new digital computer program has been developed for crashworthy analysis of seating systems in light aircraft. The program utilizes a three-dimensional mathematical model of a seat, occupant, and restraint system to predict the effectiveness of the seat and restraint system in protecting the occupant from the injurious environment of a survivable crash. Input data include detailed descrip- tions of the seat and restraint system designs. The 96</page><page sequence="56">740371-740383 three-dimensional response of the occupant is predicted for any given set of aircraft impact conditions, impacts of occupant extremities against cabin surfaces are recorded, and the injury potential for a given case is measured in terms of various criteria. The paper includes descriptions of the mathematical development of the model and the organization of the computer program. 740372. What's Next in Energy Absorption of Restraint Systems. James F. Gamble, Pacific Scientific Co. The impact loading of an occupant during crash condi- tions can be significantly reduced by absorbing a portion of the impact energy within the restraint system. A new energy absorbing device has been developed which is incorporated into the tension-type restraint system itself and provides an efficient method for passenger restraint while effectively reducing the acceleration. 740374. NASA Langley Impact Dynamics Facility. V. L. Vaughan, Jr. and E. Alfaro-Bou, Langley Re- search Center, NASA. This paper describes the NASA Langley Impact Dynam- ics Facility that will be used to crash test full-scale light aircraft under the Joint FAA/NASA General Aviation Crashworthiness Program. The aircraft are crashed into the ground as free bodies, using a pendulum swing method to obtain desired flightpath angles and velocities. The aircraft are unrestrained during impact to obtain realistic reactions. Accelerations and strains of the aircraft structure are measured during impact. The crash se- quence and structural deformations are obtained by external and internal camera coverage. 740376. The Design of Crashworthy General Aviation Aircraft. Karl Bergey, University of Oklahoma. An analysis of general aviation accident statistics for the years 1964-1967 has been made for the purpose of identifying specific aircraft or aircraft features which have proved in service to be effective in reducing crash fatalities. The results indicate that none of the current general aviation aircraft will serve as a suitable model for the design of future crashowrthy aircraft. Furthermore, the value of certain design features recommended in the crash safety literature is not confirmed by the statistics. Recommendations are made for further analysis of accident statistics as well as for programs of research and demonstration in the field of crashworthy design. 740378. Job Enrichment in a Union Environment - A Progress Report. L. C. Barry, Gates Learjet Corp. This paper describes the implementation and results of a job enrichment program at Gates Learjet Corp. The first such program at Learjet, it was set up in a small plastics shop which was relatively isolated from the rest of the plant. With the support of the union and subsequently the shop supervisor, the program was eagerly accepted by the employees. Since its inception, the shop has operated three to four people under budget with an efficiency rate of over 100%. As a result of its success, Learjet plans to introduce job enrichment into other departments. The paper details the planning for the program and some of the problems encountered. 740380. A Control Concept Combining the Best of the Current Hydromechanical and Electronic Tech- nologies. M. F. Keck, J. J. Fredlake and G. V. Schwent, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of Arizona. The AiResearch TFE731-2 Turbofan Engine Control system was created out of a recognition of engine and aircraft operating requirements in which a free weighting of candidate control components and logic was made. From this free design iteration process, which considered both conventional and advanced concepts of control, the control described in this paper has evolved and has fulfilled the in-flight operating requirements of the engine. 740381. Fuel System Requirements for Small Gas Tur- bine Engines. R. G. Moore, The Bendix Corp. Fundamental engine configurations and general fuel control functional requirements for 250-1000 hp engines are discussed. A basic fuel control system and functional options developed to meet specific requirements of several engine models are described. Design details of several example options are presented to illustrate the degree of complexity required to obtain desired functions. 740382. Fuel System Requirements for Light Aircraft Turbocharged Reciprocating Engines. J. M. Kir- win and E. A. Hasse, The Bendix Corp. Due to the desire to fly light aircraft higher and faster, the turbocharged reciprocating engine has been developed. The turbocharger supplies more air to the engine at increased manifold pressure and temperature than a naturally aspirated engine can breathe, thus producing more horsepower. When different powers are selected from a turbocharged engine, manifold pressure and temperature changes occur very rapidly. Operating a turbocharged engine also produces problems in engine cooling and detonation. The fuel system for the turbocharged engine, while similar to those on naturally aspirated engines, must be more intricate to compensate for the above mentioned conditions. 740383. Mathematical Simulation of a Vibrating Light Aircraft Piston Engine and Correlation with Engine Flight Test Data. R. H. Syson, Teledyne Continental Motors; and R. P. Caron, Arthur D. Little, Inc. Piston engines used in light aircraft occasionally expe- rience extreme in-flight vibrations, especially while driving a two-bladed propellor during a severe yaw maneuver. This paper provides experimental evidence that this condition can be avoided by the judicious selection of the 97</page><page sequence="57">740383-740391 propeller and propeller shaft masses and stiffnesses. The paper also describes a digital computer program which successfully predicts the engine speed at which resonance will occur for a given propeller-engine combination. Because new airframe applications require the successful matching of both the engine and the propeller to the airframe, this program could provide airframe, propeller, and engine manufacturers with mutually acceptable solutions to their respective design requirements. 740385. Semimonocoque Beam Analysis: A Displacement Formulation. Everett L. Cook, Wichita State University. A displacement formulation of the engineer's theory of bending which can be used to calculate the shear flows in closed-cell semimonocoque beams is derived. A computer program that utilizes this new formulation for the analyses of linearly tapered beams is also included. Three example problems illustrating the application of the method are presented. 740386. The SNKf Concept - A Method of SN Data Development for Aluminum Aircraft Structures. Richard Abbott, Cessna Aircraft Co. The SNKf concept is a method of selecting unique stress-endurance diagrams to describe the fatigue per- formance of aluminum aircraft structural elements. The SN curves are defined by the fatigue severity index (Kf). The shape and location of previously established control curves are modified by interpolation based on constant life diagrams to match each analysis or test requirement. 740387. Shell Instability Analysis Using the Finite Ele- ment Method. Terry L. Janssen, Wichita Div., The Boeing Co. The finite element displacement procedure is used to compute the instability load for a general shaped, orthotropic sandwich construction shell. For general shaped shells, failure usually occurs by means of collapse at a limit point rather than through bifurcation. Both a linear bifurcation buckling load and a geometric nonlinear analysis collapse load are computed for the nose radome of a large aircraft. The analytical solutions are compared with static test results, showing the nonlinear collapse load to be in excellent agreement. 740388. A New Method of Bulkhead Analysis in Aircraft Structures. Mihailo P. Djuric, Cessna Aircraft Co. A new method of bulkhead analysis has been developed using two-dimensional finite element analysis as a tool. The method determines the internal forces, deflections, and stress distribution along the bulkhead, and the shear flow distribution in the adjacent skin. Several bulkheads next to each other can be analyzed simultaneously if the study of interaction becomes necessary. The results of this method compare favorably with the results of a three-dimensional finite element stress analysis and test measurements. The method can be used with any existing two-dimensional finite element computer program con- taining just a beam element, and it does not require large computer storage. 740389. Structural Finite Element Analysis Aided by Computer Graphics. John A. Wallace, Beech Aircraft Corp. The use of finite element structural analysis has grown rapidly as digital computer technology has improved. An increasing portion of the engineer's time is spent building and checking finite element models and interpreting results of these models. The purpose of this paper is to propose a graphically oriented system to aid the stress analyst in his job of synthesizing finite element data. The analyst is required to decide on a solution procedure and divide the data into two basic parts. The first part is obtained by preprocessing the structural data into four basic sections. These sections are grid coordinates, element grid definitions, element section properties, and external loads. The second part is obtained by post- processing the program internal loads output into margins of safety for ultimate strength, for fatigue life, and for structural joints. This paper discusses the solution procedure for axial member shear plate idealization and presents some typical graphic displays for the input and output data. 740390. Finite Element Airplane Cost Analysis. Howard W. Smith, University of Kansas. A finite element structural analysis was extended to calculate the dollar cost of the structure and then linked to an "optimizer" to minimize the cost. This paper describes the initial effort to develop a computer program which will analyze a given structure under a known loading envelope and then optimize the member sizes to give a minimum total cost. The output from a structural analysis program forms the input for a linear optimization program. Since the optimizer was linear, and the problem in this case was nonlinear, the program was written using an iteration loop around the three FORTRAN subroutines, STRUCT, CONVRT, and SMPLEX. Iterations stop when the change in two successive cost calculations is within a limit set by the engineer or when the number of iterations exceeds a preset limit. The method is applied to some simple examples, and results are compared with the work of other authors. 740391. Aerodynamic Design Approach to the Stall/Spin Problem - The VariViggen. Burt Rutan, Bede Aircraft, Inc. Stall/spin is the major cause of general aviation fatal accidents. The VariViggen, which now has logged 300 flight hours, was designed in the wind tunnel with specific emphasis on eliminating the common stall/spin accident. Flight tests of the prototype have been most encouraging in this respect. The design is immune to the common stall 98</page><page sequence="58">740391-740415 accident while still being more maneuverable than the conventional aircraft. Design considerations relative to the susceptibility of loss of control at high angle of attack and adaptability of the canard-delta configuration to general aviation aircraft are discussed. 740392. The M. I. T. Man-Powered Aircraft. Paul Hooper, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Man's desire to fly under his own power has been given stimulus and a defined goal in the form of the Kremer Competition. A group of students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology formed a team for the purpose of designing and constructing an aircraft for this compe- tition. The result of this effort is an aircraft of biplane canard configuration. A two-person crew powers a pusher propeller. The structure of the flying surfaces is balsa wood. The fuselage is constructed of aluminum tubing. Polypropylene film covers the frameworks. The results of the test program to date have brought out several problem areas. These include the need to strengthen the canard spar, relocate the canard hinge point, provide for ground steering, and replace the rear wheel with a stronger version. Other problems have occurred in the areas of the propulsion system and spoiler control actuation. The design of the aircraft, wich is named the BURD, its construction, and the results of the tests to date are covered in this paper. 740393. The Aerocar "Flying Automobile". M. B. Taylor, Aerocar, Inc. This paper presents a discussion of the Aerocar, the flying automobile, which has been undergoing continuing development for many years. In the past, the lack of utility and of transportation convenience had caused the conventional light airplane to be attractive to only a few individuals as compared with the omnipresent automo- bile. Technical developments in the flying automobile field have proved the basic soundness and practicability of such vehicles. The engineering problems involved in arriving at a technically successful model are enumerated along with a description of interesting features unique to the Aerocar. 740395. Amphibian Aircraft Design. David B. Thurston, Schweizer Aircraft Corp. This paper opens with a brief review of service conditions satisfied by amphibian operation such as: increased single-engine safety due to water areas available for emergency landings plus protection of a rugged hull bottom; sport, business, and pleasure flying; and utility transportation into undeveloped areas. It presents basic design parameters and analyses of operational problems peculiar to the amphibian, with emphasis placed upon the flying boat type of hull. Design considerations include wing layout, engine placement and power requirements, hull shape plus beam loading and water trim limits, spray effects, landing gear arrangements, flight stability problems, docking and handling procedures, and brief market specifications for two amphibians. The study concludes with a discussion of converting existing landplanes into the amphibian con- figuration. It is the purpose of this brief paper to outline basic design parameters essential for an amphibian satisfying FAR Part 23 requirements as well as the practical considerations of flight handling, water safety, and economic operation. 740397. EPA's Responsibilities to a Changing Environ- ment. Randall S. Jessee, Environmental Protec- tion Agency. Rapidly increasing demand, not the Arab oil embargo, is the cause of the current energy crisis. This paper outlines some of the background of this problem, emphasizing that it is not the result of environmental regulations on automotive emissions, oil desulfurization, etc. EPA programs which will lead to a reduction on energy demand include development of an energy conservation program, transportation control plans, mass transit, resource recovery, fuel economy labelling, land use, and development of more efficient auto propulsion systems. 740398. Potential Use of Work Hardening Aluminum Alloy X5090 Sheet in Civil Aircraft. D. L. Graham, Conalco, Inc.; P. R. Sperry and J. Winter, Metals Research Laboratories, Olin Corp. Aluminum alloy X5090, containing a nominal 7% mag- nesium, is a recent introduction to the moderately high-strength class of alloys, but it represents a change from a heat-treatable to a work-hardening type. Advan- tages of low density, corrosion resistance, fatigue, and fracture toughness are stressed. Mechanical, physical, and corrosion properties are presented, with emphasis on problems related to stress-corrosion and formability, and their solutions. Potential uses are discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740399. Aircraft Applications for Electroless Nickel Plate. Donald W. Baudrand, The Richardson Co. Electroless nickel plating is a process of uniformly depositing a nickel-phosphorus alloy on a suitable basis metal. The source of electrical energy comes from within the plating solution. Aircraft use of electroless nickel plate has increased in recent years. Desirable properties, such as lubricity, high hardness, and good wear resistance, are described. When to select electroless nickel, specific aircraft applications, and undesirable properties of elec- troless nickel are also discussed. 740415. Friction Coefficient of Automotive Friction Ma- terials - Its Sensitivity to Load, Speed, and Temperature. S. K. Rhee, Research Labs., The Bendix Corp. Commercial "organic" friction materials were obtained from three different manufacturers, and were evaluated 99</page><page sequence="59">740415-740424 for their frictional properties. In all cases, the friction force (F) was found to be a power function of the normal load (P) and sliding speed (V) at a fixed temperature, F = K-Pa-Vb at Tj, where K is the coefficient of friction which is constant and independent of the load and speed, and a and b are one set of parameters at the temperature TP Usually, the exponent a ranges 0.80-1.25 and b from -0.25 to +0.25, depending upon the temperature. Thus, brake torque becomes a power function rather than a linear function of the line pressure. Brake fade is found to be governed by the three mechanisms - load fade, speed fade, and temperature fade. 1974 SA E Transactions 740416. Twenty-Five Years of Progress in Tires for Earthmoving Equipment. E. V. Semonin and M. A. Wilson, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Significant performance developments in most design phases of off-road tires have been made during the past twenty-five years. These advancements have been both chemical and mechanical in nature, with improved compounds, better reinforcements, and new mechanical combinations of shape, construction, and materials. In 1935, Charles F. Kettering said, "The automobile industry isn't simply the product of a single large industry, it is the product of many industries. It moves ahead as a result of new discoveries and developments in the rubber industry." This paper reflects upon some of these developments relative to the earthmoving equipment sector of the automotive industry. 740417. Fifty Years of Earthmoving in West Texas. L. P. Gilvin, Gilvin-Terrill Inc. The author reviews earthmoving as it took place in Texas from the 1920s to today. He recounts early highway and railroad development, where much of the work was done by a combination of horses or mules and machinery. Equipment introduced in the 1930s included diesel engines for tractors, power shovels, bulldozers, and carryall scrapers. The 1940s saw the advent of the first pneumatic tired scrapers and tractors in Texas. Post- World War II has seen bigger and better equipment, with new machinery being developed each year. 740418. The Evolution of Contemporary Concerns in Mobile Hydraulics. John R. Link, Hydreco. The growth of hydraulics applied to construction equip- ment has been qualitatively and quantitatively dramatic in the past 25 years. The purpose of this paper is to review the past, view the present, and speculate on the future hydraulic systems with particular focus on the evolution of operator comfort and safety, air, and noise pollution control and energy conservation. 740420. Application Considerations for Self-Lubricating Bearings in Construction Equipment. Warren C. Reynolds, Lear Siegler, Inc. Nonlubricated bearings are playing a key role in the trend toward reduced vehicle maintenance in the construction equipment field. This paper provides an overview of tetrafluoroethylene fiber bearing performance as it relates to applications on heavy-duty off-highway machinery and discusses the design parameters and problem areas which must be considered by engineers interested in taking advantage of this type of bearing. 1974 SA E Transactions 740421. Evolution of Inertia Welding in the Manufacture of Earthmoving Machinery. William M. Hallett, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The inertia welding process as developed by research engineers at Caterpillar Tractor Co. has found many applications in the manufacture of earthmoving machin- ery. This metals-joining process derives power from energy stored in a rotating flywheel system. When two components to be joined are brought into contact by thrust pressure, the energy is converted to heat through friction at the interface, permitting formation of a solid-state bond. Initially applied to replace other metals-joining methods, to solve specific problems, or to effect cost savings, inertia welding is now a basic consideration in new product design. The evolution of the inertia welding process and inertia welders from the laboratory to today, in relation to earthmoving machinery applications, is discussed in this paper. 740422. Ferrous Die Castings - the Past, the Present, and the Future. Sher Temkin, Tembro Engi- neering Inc. A practical approach to the ferrous die cast process was initiated by a research and development team at General Electric Co. The team studied the feasibility of casting ferrous metals under pressure into permanent metal molds. Detailed here is the method, castable shapes, properties, and what alloys can be cast, as well as its economic advantages. 740423. A Simplified Method for the Measurement of Vehicular Rolling Resistance. Paul R. Thomas and Ronald H. Till, General Electric Co. A method for measurement of rolling resistance of vehicles using only a single accelerometer measurement has been developed and a simple instrument has been constructed. Results of typical measurements on large, electrically propelled off-highway trucks are discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740424. Applying Numerical Optimization to Earth- moving Equipment Design. Paul D. Sandberg, John Deere Dubuque Works. Numerical optimization is a new, powerful, flexible tool which can aid engineers in the design process. This paper presents guidelines for the selection and formulation of optimization problems. It also provides insight into how to choose and program an optimization algorithm for the computer. Two example problems are solved to illustrate 100</page><page sequence="60">740424-740432 the use of optimization in earthmoving equipment design. 1974 SAE Transactions 740425. Improved Techniques for Dynamic Analysis of Earthmoving Equipment. Jack W. Martz, Wayne A. McClelland and Jason R. Lemon, Structural Dynamics Research Corp.; and Donald W. Kinsey, United States Steel Corp. A proved concept in dynamic analysis of complex machinery is the "building block" approach. Individual components, or building blocks, of the total system are analyzed separately, and then mathematically combined to predict the total system dynamic behavior. The building block concept has become a practical design tool with recent developments in sophisticated finite element techniques and computer interfaced testing equipment. This paper describes the state-of-the-art analytical and experimental methods used to determine the component properties and assemble total system models. Specifically, the application of these methods to the dynamic analysis and design of earthmoving equipment is demonstrated. 1974 SAE Transactions 740426. Computer Model for Comprehensive Evaluation of Cross-Country Vehicle Mobility. C. J. Nuttall, Jr. and A. A. Rula, U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station; and H. J. Dug- off, U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. A primary goal of U.S. Army mobility research is the development of validated, objective methodology to support decision processes relative to the design, pro- curement, and deployment of military vehicles. As a step toward that end, a comprehensive analytical model for evaluating the mobility of vehicle systems has been realized in a large-scale digital computer simulation. The model employs existing vehicle mechanics technology to predict individual facets of system performance and new analysis and programming techniques to account for their synergistic interaction. This paper describes the comprehensive model, dis- cusses its promise and its limitations, and illustrates its application. The illustrations depict the various contexts and levels of details in which the model can be applied, depending upon the specific objectives and requirements of the user. 1974 SAE Transactions 740427. The 560 Pay Loader - A Design Experience. Harry R. Wilson, International Harvester Co. The 560 PAY loader design includes the normal engi- neering requirements of performance and reliability. It also presents some interesting problems of subjective operator evaluation and vehicle appearance. This paper deals with the identification and solution of these problems. 740428. Design and Development of the JD740 Grapple Skidder. Victor C. Pierrot, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. The diminishing labor supply and the increasing demand for wood products are forcing the timber industry to look for new machines to provide less expensive ways of bringing in the wood. The grapple skidder is one such machine. This paper describes the design of a 145 hp grapple skidder and the test procedures used to evaluate its reliability. 740429. 910, D3, 931 Concept to Production. Richard K. Liess, Caterpillar Tractor Co. This paper describes the design and development of the new 60 hp class 910 wheel loader, D3 crawler tractor, and 931 track loader. Special emphasis was placed on designing all vehicles concurrently to achieve lowest possible cost by utilizing a high degree of commonality. 1974 SAE Transactions 740430. Brazil - A New Frontier. Vincent Miller, Caterpillar Americas Co. This paper discusses some of the political and social forces which led to the tremendous surge in earthmoving that we have in Brazil today. The text describes major highway and dam construc- tion and covers new airport and railroad jobs beginning today. It is hoped that this paper will bring a better understanding of today's "Brazilian Miracle" as well as the internecessity of transport and energy in the devel- opment of a nation. 740431. Management Styles and Team Effectiveness. John G. Miller, Sangamon State University; and James R. Stephens, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. By definition management is getting things done through people. It is, and always has been, a team concept. A manager's beliefs about people determine his management style, and the style used in moments of stress is extremely important. The paper describes seven management styles - crit- ical and demanding, supportive and encouraging, in- formed and problem solving, angry and put-upon, clever and manipulative, spontaneous and uninvolved, and combinations of these - stating that most managers use some combination of these styles. The relationship of managerial style to team effectiveness is then evaluated. 740432. Introduction to Fault Tree Analysis. J. L. Recht, National Safety Council. This presentation includes a brief history of fault tree analysis, its relationship to systems safety analysis, and a description of how to do a fault tree analysis both on a simple and complex level. It will demonstrate how this analytical technique can give new insight into safety problems and thereby improve proposed answers or countermeasures. The application of this approach to management problems is also discussed. 101</page><page sequence="61">740433-740440 740433. Engineering Managers as Experimenters. Charles W. N. Thompson, Technological Institute, Northwestern Univ. The methods of administrative experimentation were introduced five years ago in a graduate course for engineering managers. By concentrating on how man- agement research is done rather than on the theories and findings of academic researchers, it was proposed that the engineer would be better able to evaluate (and apply) the reports of others, and, in some cases, to use the methods of research in his own administrative decision making. This paper provides a brief and selective review of the experience of the 58 engineering managers who have taken the course. 740434. Development of an Excavator Hydraulic System for Maximum Controllability. D. L. Bianchetta, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The hydraulic system for a new excavator was designed to provide maximum operator control and comfort without sacrificing machine speed and productivity. The final characteristics are a result of the use of a hydraulic system featuring variable displacement pumps with a horsepow- er-compensated control arrangement, the optimizing of the main control valves for controllability, and the development of a pilot system with convenient operator controls to further enhance the total system performance. 740435. Hydrostatic Steering with Power-Beyond Capa- bility. J. L. Rau, Ross Gear Div., TRW Inc. Integration of the power steering function into varied control hydraulic systems of mobile equipment requires an adaptive steering valve. The new Ross 5-line Hydra- guide meets the criteria and introduces unique flexibility to steering circuit design. This paper highlights a positive displacement-type hydrostatic steering unit with an integral priority steering feature and an additional fifth port connection for a secondary hydraulic function. This concept of power- beyond capability in hydrostatic steering is discussed and its versatility demonstrated. It is shown that the power- beyond Ross Hydraguide provides simplified hydraulic circuitry and increased power utilization at moderate cost for off-highway machinery. 740436. An Acoustical Performance Appraisal Technique for Fluid Power Pumps. G. E. Maroney and L. R. Elliott, Oklahoma State University. Recent noise legislation has forced designers to evaluate carefully the acoustical characteristics of each system component in order to keep total machine sound levels within acceptable limits. Fluid power pumps represent one of the principle sources of noise which need to be acoustically evaluated prior to installation on a machine. The airborne sound power level of a fluid power pump can be appraised in several ways. This paper presents an engineering method for appraising the sound power output of fluid power pumps. The appraisal technique, based on a minimum number of tests, provides an engineering method for predicting a pump's sound level as a function of speed and pressure, and also allows reproducible rank ordering of components for accurate engineering discrimination. 1974 SA E Transactions 740437. Current Exhaust Systems for Earthmoving Equip- ment. L. J. Eriksson and L. F. Hall, Nelson Industries, Inc. This paper discusses the status of exhaust system devel- opment for earthmoving equipment. A brief review is made of single-plug and manifold mufflers followed by a discussion of quieter exhaust mufflers with aspirating sections. Possible future trends are suggested including the use of more effective spark arresting, noise silencing, and power tuning sections in increasingly complex muffler designs. 740438. Noise Reduction of Rubber Tire Front End Loaders. Donald F. Rudny, International Har- vester Co. Methods of measurement, identification, and solution of problem noise and vibration sources on front-end loaders are discussed. An actual noise reduction program suc- cessfully completed on a 6.5 yd3 vehicle is used to illustrate the effectiveness of source elimination, appli- cation of barrier and absorption materials, and vibration isolation mounts as techniques for the attenuation of noise and vibration. 740439. A Noise Control Study of Certain Diesel-Pow- ered Strip Mine Vehicles. Allan E. Nagel, U. S. Bureau of Mines. This paper describes the work performed in three distinct noise studies on typical diesel-powered strip mining equipment and discusses their results. Mufflers lowered diesel exhaust noise exposure for adjacent workers and the community at large, but had little effect on the noise level at the operator's position. Properly designed and installed noise control kits can be an effective method of reducing the operator's exposure to an acceptable level, and can simultaneously dampen vibration inside the cab. 740440. Meeting the Noise Legislation on Industrial Equipment in France (Decree of 11 April 1972). J. Fructus, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works; and C. Eline, John Deere Usine de Saran (France). The decree of 11 April 1972 has introduced stringent limitation on bystander noise of industrial equipment in France. The maximum permissible level of 80 dB(A) at 7 metres constitutes today's lowest limit proposed by any legislation. The specificity of the decree is analyzed and an attempt has been made to review the situation from a manufacturer's standpoint. 102</page><page sequence="62">740440-740448 Various difficulties encountered by the manufacturers have resulted in extensive development programs and longer lead time to produce the modified equipment. Thus, the effective date of 2 May 1973 initially adopted in the decree could not be met by most manufacturers, and general or individual deviations have been accepted by the Ministry of Protection of Nature and Environment. The general deviation of 21 December 1973 indicates ultimate dates of availability accepted for each machine. The noise reduction on four wheel drive loaders is presented as an actual example of application of the decree. 1974 SA E Transactions 740441. Some Recent Developments in the Surface Mining of Coal. John J. Breslin and Richard J. Anderson, Battelle Memorial Institute. This paper discusses mining and reclamation practices observed in Germany. Although German methodology is not directly applicable to most mining and reclamation situations encountered in the United States, on the conceptual level much that is being done in the Rhineland is worthy of study by American surface mine operators. Technical problems in American surface mines are becoming increasingly difficult each year as the more accessible deposits become exhausted and as the regu- latory constraints related to environmental impact and reclamation stiffen. But probably nowhere in the United States do these difficulties approach in magnitude the mining, environmental impact, and reclamation problems being encountered and resolved by the German operators. Moreover, the German surface mining industry has managed to maintain a largely favorable public image even though it has disrupted, for a time at least, the lives of thousands of people. 740442. Civil and Criminal Liabilities of Professionals in Business: Insurance as a Partial Solution. Thomas F. Sheehan, GATX Insurance Co. This paper discusses the legal responsibilities of business professionals in terms of civil and criminal liabilities. Individuals are now facing lawsuits for violations per- formed within the corporation, and the paper gives details of several such cases. The paper concludes that liability insurance for directors and officers of corporations is necessary to protect such individuals. 740443. Achieving Maximum Reliability Through Statis- tical Monitoring. Gary A. Roberts, Oklahoma State University. A new concept has been developed for data acquisition from equipment operating in the field. This technique, called statistical monitoring, offers unique potential for improving product reliability and performing system diagnostics. This paper presents the principles underlying the statistical monitoring concept, the techniques for applying the data to reliability and diagnostic problems, and a discussion of the program for incorporating the method in a general reliability improvement program. 740444. A Service Department's Input to Design. P. R. Stephens, Fiat-Allis Construction Machinery, Inc. The Service Department influences product design continually by evaluating product-reliability, acceptabil- ity, and serviceability from a customer's point of view. Design sections require precise technical information on all three items. This paper describes several Service Department systems utilized to provide this information in a consistent and orderly fashion. 740445. Engineering Design from the Dealer's Point of View. Gilbert D. Herr, Norwel Equipment Co. Engineering design of industrial and construction equip- ment can heavily influence the saleability of the product and the attitude of the dealer who sells and services it. Engineers should design from initial concept for: ease of operation, maintenance, and repair; safe operation; and esthetic appeal. We take for granted that the machine will incorporate reliability and productivity in its basic design. 740446. Dealer Development from a Manufacturer's Point of View. C. C. Cushman, John Deere Industrial Equipment Co.; and P. T. Quinlan, Deere and Co. Dealer development is a composite of policies and procedures blended with guidance and counsel for the express purpose of developing one of the manufacturer's most important assets - his retail dealer organization. By properly utilizing the combination above, a manufac- turer-supplier's objective should be to develop the dealer organization to the point where they maximize sales potential and profitability. We will consider the subject of dealer development from a manufacturer's point of view from three aspects: 1. What is a dealer development program? 2. When is the appropriate time for a manufacturer- supplier to consider a dealer development program? 3. Basic ingredients and implementation of a dealer development program. 740447. Overseas Marketing Problems. John C. Tucker, Westinghouse Air Brake Co. Trade deficits in recent years led the U.S. government to take a hard look at its international trade policy. The result was a dollar devaluation and other government incentives to industry to increase exports. These increased exports mean more problems to corporations already selling overseas and new problems to corporations who have not previously marketed overseas. This paper will examine some of the problems involved in overseas marketing as opposed to domestic marketing. 740448. Maintenance and Design Problems with Current 103</page><page sequence="63">740448-740455 Earthmoving Machines. C. E. Sanders, Green Construction Co. Contractors continue to purchase manufacturers' ma- chines which are designed for an intended operation, although such machines cause operators, mechanics, and owners undue downtime and increased operation and maintenance cost. Some of the recurring problems identified by contractors' personnel are included in this presentation. 740449. Earthmoving Equipment: Its Effect on the Op- erator. Donald Hess, Caterpillar Tractor Co. During the last decade, performance of earthmoving equipment has improved tremendously, but changes to increase operator comfort and ease of operation have not always kept pace with these improvements. The intent of this paper is to spotlight some of the problem areas that can affect operator comfort or performance and suggest possible improvements. 740451. Application of Hydrogen to Commercial Trans- ports. Don L. Kelly, Lockheed-California Co. This paper documents the design analysis of the conver- sion of a current wide-bodied jet transport aircraft from jet fuel to hydrogen fuel. A current NASA sponsored study is defining the design, performance, and cost characteristics of a new hydrogen fueled subsonic transport scheduled for entering service in the 1990-95 time period. This aircraft embodies advanced technology engines having high thrust to weight ratio and low specific fuel consumption, advanced composite structures, and active controls. The net effect promises substantial reduction in gross weight and fuel consumption, and improved operating economics. This paper addresses a corollary task: it may become desirable or necessary to convert in-production air transports to hydrogen circa 1985. Determine the feasi- bility, characteristics, cost, and operating economics of a typical wide-bodied transport conversion. 1974 SAE Transactions 740452. ACLS for a Commercial Transport. T. Desmond Earl, Bell Aerospace Co. Application of air cushion landing gear to a commercial transport is considered. An example aircraft based on a modified configuration of a Boeing 737-100 is used to derive weight and cost figures. Effect on takeoff and landing field lengths due to use of a suction braking system is analyzed. Comparative safety of ACLS versus wheelgear is argued. It is concluded that an ACLS aircraft can show economic and cost advantage and its operation differences are acceptable within the existing and developing air transport system. 1974 SA E Transactions 740453. Advanced Controls for Commercial Transport Aircraft. Henry A. Shomber, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.; and Richard B. Holloway, Wichi- ta Div., The Boeing Co. Advanced control concepts, e.g. Control Configured Vehicle (CCV) and Advanced Controls Technology hold considerable promise of more efficient operation for commercial transports. These potential improvements, greatest for new designs that include the control concepts from their outset, yield reductions in airplane weight and/or drag with associated impact on fuel requirements, operating costs, etc. Limited improvement is also avail- able for existing airplanes that meet certain control system requirements. This paper discusses the potential impact of advanced controls on commercial transports as performance im- provements or fuel savings, and the improvement sensi- tivity to the design mission and configuration. The commercial application of these advanced concepts must follow flight demonstration of the flight-critical aspects, and careful determination of the reliability (safety and dispatch), certification, and economic aspects. Finally, research and demonstration activities necessary for the commercial application of these advanced control con- cepts are recommended. 1974 SAE Transactions 740454. New Design and Operating Techniques for Im- proved Terminal Area Compatibility. John P. Reeder, Robert T. Taylor and Thomas M. Walsh, NASA Langley Research Center. Current aircraft operating problems that must be alle- viated for future high-density terminal areas are safety, dependence on weather, congestion, energy conservation, noise, and atmospheric pollution. The microwave landing system (MLS) under development by FAA provides increased capabilities over the current ILS. It is, however, necessary and urgent to develop the airborne system's capability to take maximum advantage of the MLS capabilities in order to solve the terminal area problems previously mentioned. A major limiting factor in lon- gitudinal spacing for capacity increase is the trailing vortex hazard. Promising methods for causing early dissipation of the vortices are being explored. Also, flight procedures for avoiding the hazard will be explored. 1974 SAE Transactions 740455. Propulsion System Sizing for Powered Lift and Mechanical Flap Quiet Aircraft. Jeffrey V. Bowles, Thomas L. Galloway and Mark H. Waters, NASA Ames Research Center. Propulsion system sizing for mechanical flap and ex- ternally blown flap aircraft is demonstrated. Included in this study is the effect of. various levels of noise suppression on the aircraft final design characteristics. Both aircraft are sized to operate from a 3000 ft runway and perform the same mission. For each aircraft concept, propulsion system sizing is demonstrated for two different engine cycles - one having a fan pressure ratio of 1.5 and a bypass ratio of 9 and the other having a fan pressure ratio of 1.25 and a bypass ratio of 17.8. The results 104</page><page sequence="64">740455-740469 presented include the required thrust-to-weight ratio, wing loading, resulting gross weight and direct operating costs as functions of the engine noise level for each combination of engine cycle and aircraft concept. 1974 SA E Transactions 740457. Effects of STOL Thrust Reversers and Powered Lift on Inlet Flow Quality. Dale A. Sherman and William J. Usab, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. An experimental test program was conducted to deter- mine the engine environment which results from STOL operation with blown flaps and thrust reversers. Testing was conducted in a low speed wind tunnel with a 1/11 scale model of a STOL transport consisting of a fuselage and high-lift wing with triple-slotted externally blown flaps, leading edge slats, and powered model engines. Steady-state and dynamic total pressure distortion were moderate at takeoff and approach conditions with blown flaps. The cascade type STOL thrust reversers tested produced severe dynamic distortion due to unstable interactions of the reversed streams with the oncoming flow and vortex ingestion. Comments on methods to alleviate these problems are presented. 1974 SA E Transactions 740458. Sonic Inlet Technology Development and Appli- cation to STOL Propulsion. F. Klujber and J. V. O'Keefe, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. Recent developments in sonic inlet technology are presented with particular emphasis on STOL propulsion systems. Inlet noise reduction requirements are discussed for an augmentor wing and an upper surface blowing type of propulsion system. The current state-of-the-art is discussed with respect to performance and noise potential of different sonic inlet concepts. Acoustic and aero- dynamic performance comparison is presented for several inlet configurations based on experimental results. 740464. Heavy-Lift Helicopter Power Systems. Dennis Stein, Boeing Vertol Co. The purpose of this paper is to present the analytical, developmental, and test efforts used to achieve an integrated system responsive to the U.S. Army's heavy-lift helicopter (HLH) needs. A comprehensive discussion of various approaches which were examined with particular emphasis on elements unique to this aircraft are presented. The methodology used in interfacing various components in determining the final design configuration is also presented. 740465. Secondary Power Systems. W. P. Hannan, American Airlines, Inc. The DC- 10 has four secondary power systems: auxiliary power unit, hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical. This paper is based on present experience and identifies what is good and should continue as well as projects where aircraft configuration and utilization changes will dictate new design. It presents to secondary power system equipment designers what will be expected in the future. 740466. L-1011 Secondary Power Systems: Design and Function. E. A. Green, Lockheed-California Co. The secondary power systems on the L-1011, that is, the hydraulic, electrical power, pneumatic systems and their components, were all designed with the total aircraft system operation integrated into each subsystem as a firm design requirement. In some cases where supplier com- ponents had a major effect on systems design, the supplier was given responsibility to integrate some or all of a secondary power system. A detailed analysis of aircraft operation, including the required redundancy, was developed as a portion of each system design. Then the interaction of the systems was considered in determining the final design configuration. This paper deals with the design philosophy used in each of these power systems, and their description and operation. It draws conclusions concerning the improve- ments in system or design approach which may be proposed for future designs. 740467. Investigation of Noise from Full-Scale High Bypass Engine and Blown Flap System. W. L. Jones and L. J. Heidelberg, NASA Lewis Research Center. A summary is presented of an acoustic test program for investigating engine noise suppression and jet/flap inter- action noise associated with an externally blown flap (EBF) STOL powered lift system. A highly suppressed TF-34 engine and EBF wing were used in the investi- gation. The engine was suppressed 21 PndB to a level of 94 PndB. An under-the-wing powered lift system was tested with conventional, mixer, and decayer-type nozzles. The configuration with velocity decayer nozzle and acoustically treated shroud had the lowest noise (98 PndB). An over-the-wing configuration with nondecayer nozzle was about 10 dB quieter than the corresponding UTW system. UTW and OTW noise data are compared with scale model correlations. 740468. Externally Blown Flap Noise Research. Robert G. Dorsch, NASA Lewis Research Center. The Lewis Research Center cold-flow model externally blown flap (EBF) noise research test program is sum- marized. Both engine under-the-wing and over-the-wing EBF wing section configurations were studied. Ten large-scale and 19 small-scale EBF models were tested. A limited number of forward airspeed effect and flap noise suppression tests were also run. The key results and conclusions drawn from the flap noise tests are summa- rized and discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740469. Nozzle Development for the Upper Surface - Blown Jet Flap on the YC-14 Airplane. Howard Skavdahl, Timothy Wang and William J. Hirt, 105</page><page sequence="65">740469-740475 The Boeing Co. A discussion of wing-nozzle configuration development for the application of upper surface blowing to a STOL airplane is presented. The technical challenge is to achieve an integrated system which provides the desired performance for the low speed design conditions and also results in efficient operation during cruise. The resulting configuration is a complete integration of the propulsion system and airplane aerodynamics to achieve efficient operation at all regimes. This paper examines the major design parameters to be considered, describes a number of the configurations tested, and presents static and wind tunnel test results for these configurations. Concluding remarks are made relative to USB nozzle development. 1974 SA E Transactions 740470. Low-Speed Aerodynamics of the Upper-Surface Blown Jet Flap. Joseph L. Johnson, Jr., NASA Langley Research Center; and Arthur E. Phelps, III, U.S. Army Air Mobility Res. &amp; Dev. Lab. This paper summarizes the results of recent wind-tunnel investigations conducted to provide fundamental aero- dynamic information on the upper-surface blown jet-flap concept incorporating high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. The results of the investigations have shown the concept to have aerodynamic performance generally comparable to that of other externally blown high-lift systems. This paper will cover some of the more critical problem areas associated with this concept and will discuss solutions which have been found for these problems. 1974 SA E Transactions 740471. Propulsion Integration for a Hybrid Propulsive- Lift System. M. K. Bowden, J. H. Renshaw and H. S. Sweet, Lockheed-Georgia Co. In a discussion of STOL vehicles with conventional high-lift devices, the need for efficient power-augmented lift systems is presented and the implications of quiet operation are noted. The underlying philosophy of a promising hybrid lift system with major interactions between aerodynamic, thermodynamic, acoustic, and configuration design technologies is derived. The tech- nique by which engine and airframe-related character- istics for this application may be matched in an optimum manner is described and illustrated by describing the features of a particular short-haul commercial STOL vehicle. 1974 SA E Transactions 740472. Disposal of Waste Oils at Military Air Bases. Martin Lieberman and Alan Beerbower, Esso Research and Engineering Co.; and Ronald H. Kroop, U.S. Air Force. The disposal of waste lubricants and fuels at U.S. Air Force and Navy facilities is discussed in this paper. The waste products covered include: synthetic turbine oil, aviation piston engine oil, hydraulic fluids, and contam- inated JP-4 and JP-5. Technical feasibility and the economics of various disposal alternatives, including use as a fuel, rerefining, and recycling, as well as entre- preneurial outlets are presented. Waste lubricants and fuels handling, classification, and storage are also dis- cussed in connection with the disposal problem. 740473. A Study of High Temperature Fuels and Lubri- cants on Supersonic Aircraft/Engine System Performance. T. E. Russell, General Electric Co.; and R. E. Mattes, McDonnell Aircraft Co. An evaluation of the influence of two classes of fuels and four types of lubricants on supersonic military interceptor aircraft performance at the airframe subsystem and engine component level is presented. Engine cycles representative of anticipated technology levels in the 1980 time period are analyzed to determine interceptor performance as a function of fuel and lubricant properties and temperature limitations. The relative allotment of available fuel heat sink between engine and airframe is also investigated to determine the primary factors affected by fuel interface temperature and to provide meaningful design guidance for future system applications. The results indicate that with an integrated systems approach to the management of the aircraft and engine system heat loads, JP type fuels, and type 2 (MIL-L-27502) lubricants will meet the minimum requirements for advanced military systems. The use of a fuel with JP-7 thermal stability can provide a significant effect on engine performance. Above a min- imum level, however, bulk oil temperature has only secondary influence on aircraft performance. 1974 SA E Transactions 740474. U. S. Government Airport Capacity Planning. Charles L. Blake, Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Admin. In order to formulate policy for the orderly development and use of the nation's navigable air space, federal agencies such as the FAA and the Department of Transportation have launched several programs to de- termine aviation requirements for the next 10 years. This paper outlines their conclusions concerning airborne activities such as flow control, approach and departure control, wake vortex problems, and operating procedures as well as airport capacity and ground operations. The impact of the FAA's Research and Development Program and the implications of the current fuel shortage and economic situation are also discussed. 740475. The Paradox of Airport Capacity. Armen Der- Hohannesian, Massachusetts Port Authority. In a comparatively short time, air transportation has established itself as by far the dominant mode of intercity travel by common carrier and it will continue to be in the foreseeable future. However, the ability to continue to provide the safest and most convenient method of intercity transportation is in jeopardy if airport facilities are not available in time to accommodate adequately the levels of traffic which the demands for air service 106</page><page sequence="66">740475-740484 generate. This paper, although recognizing the impor- tance of all airport system components, assesses the airfield capacity problem of today and the future and describes various influences that affect the airport oper- ator's attempts to improve capacity. 1974 SA E Transactions 740477. Electronic Wizardry, Concrete, and Decision Making as Keys to Airport Capacity. S. B. Poritzky, Air Transport Association of America. Airport capacity at major airports is less now than it was only a year ago. The prospect of ATC technology improvements providing major capacity increases are much smaller than anticipated. The bigger payoff must come from a truly integrated total airport design, along with enough runways, adequate airport access, and in the long term airplanes which better fit high density airports. The paper outlines problems which are affecting airport capacity, and assesses the problems and prospects in achieving major improvements in airport capacity and reduction of delay. Many elements must work synergis- tically and must be drawn more closely together if there is to be a cost-effective, high-capacity airport system. 740478. Cooperative Airframe/Propulsion Control for Supersonic Cruise Aircraft. William G. Schweik- hard and Donald T. Berry, NASA Flight Research Center. Interactions between propulsion systems and flight con- trols have emerged as a major control problem on supersonic cruise aircraft. This paper describes the nature and causes of these interactions and the approaches to predicting and solving the problem. Integration of propulsion and flight control systems appears to be the most promising solution if the interaction effects can be adequately predicted early in the vehicle design. Signif- icant performance, stability, and control improvements may be realized from a cooperative control system. 1974 SA E Transactions 740480. Flight/Propulsion Control Integration Aspects of Energy Management. M. J. Wendl, G. G. Grose, J. L. Porter and V. R. Pruitt, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Analytical studies indicate substantial aircraft perform- ance benefits can result from proper application of energy management principles, and that conceptual approaches involving close coupling of aerodynamic, propulsion, and control technical elements are required to achieve these benefits. Analytical tools used in these studies include a modified Rutowski technique for simultaneously optimiz- ing throttle position and flight path. Pilot-in-the-loop simulation results are presented and the use of advanced pilot displays utilizing energy management techniques are described. Factors affecting the implementation of flight/pro- pulsion control integration techniques for energy man- agement are considered. Elements of fly-by-wire control augmentation systems, electronic engine controls, ad- vanced pilot displays, and automatically controlled inlet and nozzle systems in future aircraft designs are discussed. Conclusions about the current technology base are drawn, and recommendations are made concerning future effort in this field and the potential in aircraft maneuverability and performance offered by application of energy man- agement concepts. 1974 SA E Transactions 740481. Integrated Flight /Propulsion Control Design Techniques Starting with the Engine. G. J. Sevich and E. C. Beattie, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. New techniques are being developed to determine the analytical design and hardware implementation of multi- variable control systems for complex aircraft propulsion systems. The analytical design can be accomplished with applied optimal control theory. Hardware configuration trade studies can be used to determine the best way to implement the propulsion system for a particular aircraft. These techniques may be expanded to the design of integrated flight/propulsion control systems. 1974 SA E Transactions 740482. Opportunities in Flight/Propulsion Control Coupling (FPCC). E. Rachovitsky, U.S. Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab. Flight/propulsion control coupling (FPCC) is a flight control technique which couples propulsive forces with aerodynamic forces to affect the flight path and/or flight stability. FPCC is a powerful technique for enhancing and/or enabling performance of advanced airborne vehicles. An overview of the problem of developing the FPCC technology is presented to illuminate some of its key overall requirements. A need for a total system/total mission approach is indicated. 740483. Development of Pollution Controls for Rolls- Royce RB 211 and Olympus 593 Engines. A. B. Wassell, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. Progress in the application of well-known pollution- control techniques to existing engines is demonstrated in relation to the visibility of the exhaust smoke plume in the RB 211 and Olympus 593 engines. The reasons for the apparently protracted nature of this progress are discussed and shown to be related to the maintenance of safety and durability standards. Methods being used to reduce the other combustion generated pollutants are mentioned, especially in relation to the standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A review of some problems associated with measurement and sampling of pollutants is given. 740484. Development of a Reduced Smoke Combustor for the JT3D Engine. A. W. Nelson, Pratt &amp; 107</page><page sequence="67">740484-740489 Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. A new combustor configuration having substantially lower smoke emission characteristics is now in the final stages of development for the JT3D commercial aircraft turbofan engine. In addition, the low-power emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are considerably reduced. This burner configuration utilizes many of the features developed in the JT8D turbofan engine smoke reduction program; however, it was also necessary to incorporate air-assist fuel injection nozzles to achieve smoke levels below the EPA regulation requirement of 25. Correction of a nozzle carbon formation problem and further durability testing must be accomplished before this combustor can be released for in-service commercial airline controlled-service use evaluation. 740485. The Experimental Clean Combustor Program - Description and Status. Richard W. Niedzwiecki and Robert E. Jones, Lewis Research Center, NASA. The "Experimental Clean Combustor Program" is a contract effort with primary objectives including the generation and demonstration of technology for devel- opment of advanced commercial CTOL aircraft engines with lower exhaust emissions than current aircraft, and the demonstration of this technology in full-scale engines in 1976. The program is being conducted in three phases: screening of low pollutant combustors, refinement of the best combustors, and engine demonstration of the best combustors. The combustor screening phase was initiated in December 1972 and is currently in progress. Contracts were awarded to Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft and the General Electric Co. to evolve combustors for the JT-9D and the CF6-50 engines respectively. Pollution goals are emission index values of 20 and 4 for carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons respectively at engine idle conditions, and an oxides of nitrogen emission index level of 10 at engine takeoff conditions. Pollution reduction approaches being investigated include multiple burning zone combustors, investigations of improved fuel distri- bution, and preparation and staging of combustor airflow. 740486. STOL Operations and Facilities at Houston Intercontinental Airport. Joseph A. Foster, Dept. of Aviation, City of Houston. The development of the first successful scheduled system of STOL operations at a major United States commercial airport has been undertaken at Houston Intercontinental Airport. The STOL system was established to demonstrate the capability of STOL aircraft to operate safely and efficiently in airspace over a major commercial airport simultaneously with high-density scheduled airline oper- ations. The demonstration project included the devel- opment of new and experimental runway lighting and loading systems by the Federal Aviation Administration. It encouraged the implementation of new air traffic control procedures that have proved acceptable to the Federal Aviation Administration and to the airline pilots association. This paper describes the development of the system and gives pertinent details of its operation. 740487. Design and Development of Montreal and Ottawa STOLports. D. L. Button, Ministry of Trans- port, Canada. The Canadian Ministry of Transport has embarked on a program to provide a downtown-to-downtown scheduled IFR STOL service between Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa, Ontario. As part of the total systems approach to the devel- opment of the service, two STOLports were designed and built. Preliminary standards and criteria were developed to enable the design to be carried out. New electronic approach aids and modified visual aids are incorporated into the system. The STOLports will be completed and operating by March 1974. 740488. Amphibian STOL and Its Facilities. Rollo G. Smethers, Jr., Lockheed-Georgia Co. The short-haul transportation problem, worldwide, is characterized by congestion both on the ground and in the air. Solutions in the form of ground transportation are expensive in terms of land utilization, high development costs, their adverse effect on the environment and ecology, and are 20-30 years in the future. STOL offers a solution, but the high cost of land for downtown STOLports has precluded implementation. The STOL amphibian provides a solution which uses existing waterways situated downtown in every major city. It will relieve ground congestion and alleviate saturated airports. Studies show that such a system meets the ten basic requirements established by the National Envi- ronmental Policy Act of 1969 and that it contributes significantly to a reduction in the energy consumed in travel to and from the airports. In terms of facilities, land requirements for the terminal are just 16% of a conventional STOLport. A ramp of 10:1 slope is required, along with appropriate patrol and crash boats. Fuel storage would be in the form of moored barges. Amphibian STOL service generates unique problems: these include freezing of waters in northern climes, floating debris, ground fog on water, and sharing of "runway" with marine pleasure boat traffic. Solutions to such problems are at hand, in the form of operational technique or facilities, which are neither costly nor time-consuming to implement. 740489. FAA Aircraft Retrofit Feasibility Program. James F. Woodall, Federal Aviation Agency. The FAA retrofit feasibility program is a success story. The cooperation of the aircraft industry in general, and the FAA's contractors in particular have made the success of the program possible. We can now state that all JT3D- and JT8D-powered aircraft can meet reduced noise levels, such as FAR 36 levels, by means of technologically 108</page><page sequence="68">740489-740495 feasible and economically reasonable nacelle retrofit solutions. These solutions will not aggravate the energy crisis by virtue of a negligible increase in fuel consumption for the nominal flight conditions. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is about to be disseminated which could lead to the requirement that all JT3D/JT8D-powered aircraft be retrofitted by 1978 with quiet nacelles so that FAR 36 requirements can be satisfied. 740490. Reduction of JT8D Powered Aircraft Noise by Engine Refanning. L. E. Stitt and A. A. Medeiros, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center, Cleve- land, Ohio. The purpose of the Refan Program is to establish the technical feasibility of substantially reducing the noise levels of existing JT8D powered aircraft. This would be accomplished by retrofitting the existing fleet with quieter refan engines and new acoustically treated nacelles. No major technical problems exist that preclude the devel- opment and installation of refanned engines on aircraft currently powered by the JT8D engine. The refan concept is technically feasible and provides calculated noise reductions of from 7 to 8 EPNdB for the B727-200 aircraft and from 10 to 12 EPNdB for the DC-9-32 aircraft at the FAR Part 36 measuring stations. These noise levels are lower than both the FAR Part 36 noise standards and the noise levels of the wide-body DC- 10- 10. Corresponding reductions in the 90 EPNdB footprint area are estimated to vary from about 70 percent for the DC-9 to about 80 percent for the B727. The refanned aircraft should perform typical range/payload missions with a negligible effect on block fuel. Production retrofit kits could be available in 1976 for the DC-9 at a unit cost of about $1.0 million and in 1977 for the B727 at a unit cost of $1.7 million. 1974 SAE Transactions 740492. Jet Noise Suppression. Gordon Banerian, U. S. Department of Transportation. This paper describes a variety of methods employed in the past to modify or suppress jet noise. Some of the intriguing aspects of the factors that contribute to noise suppression are brought out. The paper concludes that a systematic study of the physics of jet suppression, in place of the ad hoc methods used in the past, is required if the concepts involved are to be utilized for design and accurate predictions in the quest for the quiet aircraft. 1974 SAE Transactions 740493. An Approach to Aeroengine Tradeoff Factors. T. D. Sills, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. Engine tradeoff factors are discussed in a general manner. Some of the problems of their interpretation and their limitations in use, particularly when presented by the aircraft constructor or operator to the aeroengine manu- facturer, are shown. The discussion is restricted to the performance and economic aspects of civil transport aircraft. Illustrative examples are given. 740494. Performance Versus Cost Tradeoffs - Initial Look at Alternatives. G. P. Sallee, American Airlines, Inc. The energy crisis demands that we review the cost versus performance of various alternatives to attempt to under- stand what can be done and in what priority the various alternatives should be addressed. This analysis addresses, on a first order basis, some of the engine alternatives suggested to reduce the impact of rising fuel prices. It is concluded, based on the analysis which considered the depreciation of investment, the cost of capital, insurance and maintenance expenses, as well as fuel savings, that in order of priority, we must: 1. Investigate the optimum way to improve current in-service engine performance at minimum increase in maintenance cost. 2. Investigate the possibility of improving current engines by means of modification within current dimen- sions to improve components. Only after these are investigated and fuel prices have substantially increased, will retrofit of new engines on old aircraft be worthy of consideration. There is need to develop the methodologies to predict accurately the total cost impact versus performance improvement for future decision making. A suggested approach and the results of such an analysis which support the priorities listed is presented. 740495. Impact of Increasing Secondary Power Require- ments on Engine and Accessory System Design. J. W. Jongeneel and R. T. Kawai, McDonnell Douglas Corp. The purposes of this paper are to review the trends in airframe secondary power requirements imposed on the main propulsion engines; to project likely future re- quirements; and to stimulate thinking in order to identify alternative future approaches that may improve airline economics. In order to orient engine and airframe manufacturers' products to place more emphasis on minimizing total operating costs, the airlines should be considering and inputting to the manufacturers the desirability of alternative secondary power system ap- proaches. The amount of secondary power required can be expected to increase as advancements occur in navi- gational equipment and in the use of augmentation and dynamic control mechanisms. Improved secondary power system reliability will be required to maintain satisfactory economics with acceptable flight dispatch delay and cancellation rates. Due to a more favorable environment, improved reliability of secondary power generation units may result from utilizing a pylon location. A reliable means for power transmission between the engines and accessories must be used with this approach. Other possibilities for reliability improvement need to be 109</page><page sequence="69">740495-740502 developed if control augmentation or active controls are used in future aircraft. 740496. Elements Affecting Runway Traction. Walter B. Home, NASA Langley Research Center. The five basic elements affecting runway traction for jet transport aircraft operation are identified and described in terms of pilot, aircraft system, atmospheric, tire, and pavement performance factors or parameters. Runway traction is so affected by the interaction of these elements that it becomes an impossible task to discuss the effects of each element individually. For this reason, this paper discusses runway traction under the general headings of dry, wet and flooded, and snow and ice conditions. Where possible, research results are summarized, and means for restoring or improving runway traction for these different conditions are discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740497. Impact of Runway Traction on Possible Ap- proaches to Certification and Operation of Jet Transport Aircraft. Leslie R. Merritt, Federal Aviation Administration. The Federal Aviation Administration (FA A) has been working to determine the need for changes in the landing certification rule for transport category aircraft. Statistics show that numerous incidents occur each year on wet, snow- or ice-covered runways. A change in certification and operational rules could reduce, or possibly eliminate, such incidents. Numerous investigations have been made with jet transport aircraft and ground vehicle friction- measuring devices to establish relationships on wet surfaces. Results of these investigations have had an impact on possible rule changes and have identified three basic problems. The framework is advanced for a system that can accommodate a change to transport category aircraft-landing certification and operations rules. It is emphasized that any changes must adhere to the standard regulatory process. 1974 SAE Transactions 740498. Improved Methods for Construction and Main- tenance of Runway Pavement Surfaces. Thomas H. Morrow, Airports Service, FAA. Slippery runway pavement surfaces present a serious loss to aircraft tire traction and directional control during landing operations. Several agencies in the federal government and aviation community are combining their efforts toward providing pavement surfaces that will support safe aircraft tire traction in all adverse weather conditions. This paper discusses some of the methods used in construction and maintenance of airport pave- ment surfaces and the ongoing research efforts to solve the slippery runway pavement problem. 740499. Runway Traction from the Airline/Pilot Point of View. F. E. Illston, American Airlines, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to focus attention on runway traction problems associated with the operation of high-performance aircraft from an airline pilot's point of view. Because heavy jet aircraft are exposed to a greater risk of skidding on wet slippery runways, runway requirements have become more sophisticated and de- manding. The problems of tire hydroplaning and runway slipperiness are particularly hazardous to turbojet oper- ation. Wheel/pavement contact is most significant to stopping and directional control of aircraft movement. 740499. Runway Traction from the Airline/Pilot Point of View. F. E.

Hainline and N. S. Attri, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The effect of runway traction on commercial airplane stopping systems is discussed from the airframe manu- facturer's point of view. Traction variations with runway contaminants, ice, snow, and rain must be considered along with factors such as airplane and stopping system configuration, weather conditions, performance informa- tion, and pilot technique. Further improvements in airplane braking and directional control can be attained if certification and operation regulations provide perform- ance credit, safety, and economic motivation for airline cost of ownership. Recent Boeing brake control system work is summarized as an indication of industry effort to improve performance. Technology requirements and recommendations for improving adverse runway per- formance are included. 740502. Powered Lift for Longer Field Lengths and Longer Missions? H. R. Leslie and J. A. Bennett, Lockheed-Georgia Co. It is hypothesized that the potential value of powered lift may be greater for transport applications requiring RTOL and CTOL field lengths than for those requiring STOL performance. Thus, it is implied that powered lift can be applied effectively to aircraft designed for medium and long haul, as well as short haul. This premise has been reached on the basis of observed trends in direct operating cost, mission fuel consumption, and, most significantly, community noise footprint areas for both powered lift and conventional mechanical flap configurations. Some per- tinent results from recent NASA-sponsored configuration design and system studies for quiet short haul and fuel-conservative aircraft are discussed, and further data 110</page><page sequence="70">740502-740521 are developed to explore the potential value of incor- porating powered lift concepts in advanced aircraft designs for medium and long haul applications. Finally, propulsive lift retrofits of contemporary transports are examined to determine the resulting influence on aircraft noise footprints and/or balanced field length. 740503. A Perspective On Short-Haul STOL. L. V. Malthan, McDonnell Douglas Corp. This paper discusses the basic incentives motivating the development of the short-haul STOL air transportation system and the technological impact of propulsion lift on fundamental aircraft parameters and related economics. The incentives are aimed at alleviating some of the current accrued ills of the existing CTOL system. Specifically ground and air congestion environmental impact relief, and customer service can be improved by the introduction of the potential system. The technological impact on the aircraft and its related economics required to achieve short field per- formance is generally detrimental. Considerations such as wing and empennage sizing, engine thrust sizing and cycle selection, thrust reverser requirements, cruise Mach number effects, noise, and fuel usage impacts are discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740516. (SP-390) Diesel Engine Lubrication. James A. MacLean, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A survey of the history of lubricants for diesel engines is presented. Early research programs on ring sticking and scuffing introduced additives to the previously used straight mineral crankcase oils, and also initiated engine testing to measure lubricant performance. The classi- fication systems which evolved from this testing are described in their various stages of development. The influence of lubricant on engine performance or ring action is examined, and current oil-related problems such as ring belt deposits and ring sticking, oil con- sumption, and valve train wear are discussed. The question of oil-drain period is also reviewed. Current research efforts concerning the development of a universal diesel fuel and the evaluation of test results are also described in the paper. 740517. (SP-390) Influence of Lubrication System Var- iables on Sleeve Bearing Performance. William A. Yahraus, Gould Inc. Long bearing life is contingent upon maintaining three key parameters within acceptable limits - bearing back temperature, minimum oil film thickness, and peak oil film pressure. How these parameters are affected by such lubricant considerations as oil flow, oil cleanliness, viscosity, sump temperature, and oxidation resistance is described. The paper then examines the mechanical properties required in a sleeve bearing material and the critical factors in the geometric design of the bearing. Finally, the housing into which the shell fits and the shaft which the bearing supports are considered. General rules and standards for optimizing bearing life are presented, as is an Appendix consisting of a bearing "failure handbook." 740518. (SP-390) Engine Lubricating Oil Filtration: A Paradox of Variable Constants. William G. Nostrand, Nelson Industries, Inc. The role of filtration in the lubricating system of an engine is examined historically and practically. The author discusses filter requirements generally, then describes the four basic filtration systems for engine lubricating oil. Filtration methods and types, and the application of a filter to an engine lube system are also described. A sample filtration analysis is presented along with graphical laboratory data. 740519. (SP-390) Universal Engine Oils: Prime Quality for Prime Movers. Danford H. Olson, Shell Development Co. To meet the needs of fleet operators, engine crankcase oils for use in gasoline, nonturbocharged 2- and 4-cycle and turbocharged 2- and 4-cycle diesel engines have been developed by the oil industry. This paper reviews the laboratory and field performance of a 1.0% wt ash universal oil in gasoline and diesel engine powered trucks. Excellent field performance was documented by analysis of engine maintenance records from several truck fleets. 740520. Cold Weather Drivability Performance of Late Model Cars. A. M. Horowitz and W. L. Wäs- cher, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. Drivability performance of recent model cars has been adversely affected by design requirements for lowering exhaust gas emissions. Published reports have indicated a need for gasoline volatility modifications to minimize the impact of these engine design changes on drivability. This paper presents the results of a low-temperature program to investigate the drivability performance of ten 1973 U.S. vehicles and to determine the effect on performance of changes in gasoline volatility. Drivability performance was affected much more by engine design variables than by changes in fuel volatility. In cold start and driveaway operation, some cars per- formed well on all fuels at all temperatures. Others gave poor performance on most fuels at all temperatures - with hesitation, stumble, stall on acceleration, and stall im- mediately after start-up being most prevalent problems. During warm operation, the primary malfunction noted was surge which varied widely among the 10 cars tested and was unrelated to fuel volatility. In several cars, warm operation problems approached or exceeded those found in cold start and driveaway operation. 740521. Passenger Car Drivability in Hot Weather. R. M. Reuter, Texaco Inc.; and J. E. Robinson, The Standard Oil Co. (Ohio). During the fall of 1971, the Coordinating Research 111</page><page sequence="71">740521-740527 Council conducted a test program at Yuma, Arizona to investigate a drivability test procedure and the effects of fuel volatility on drivability during hot weather (90- 100°F). The procedure included evaluation of vapor lock, hot start and run, and traffic driveaway. In phase I, 12 late-model automobiles and two fuel series were evalu- ated. In phase II, four cars and four raters were used to evaluate repeatability and reproducibility. Traffic drive- away of individual cars was related to fuel volatility but could not be defined by a general volatility factor for all vehicles. Vapor lock, as in the past, was related to front-end volatility. A usable procedure was demon- strated; however, it was shown that fr traffic driveaway, the influence of the rater should be reduced. 740522. Fuel Economy and Cold-Start Drivability with Some Recent-Model Cars. J. C. Ingamells, Chevron Research Co. Fuel economy and drivability have deteriorated as a result of engine changes made to reduce exhaust emissions in recent-model cars. To study this problem, chassis dy- namometer tests were run with 1970 and 1972 cars using both cold-start and hot-start procedures. Fuel economy and drivability were evaluated during the first 2 miles and the last 3 miles of a 50° F cold-start driving cycle similar to the Coordinating Research Council road test. Fuel economy was also evaluated under warmed-up conditions at 72° F using the last half of the cold-start cycle. The effects of car year model, gasoline volatility, gasoline heat content, and car warmup are discussed in this paper. 740523. New Multigrade SE/CD Lubricant. R. E. Kay and J. A. O'Brien, Amoco Chemicals Corp. A new 20W-40 multigrade oil that meets SE/CD speci- fications promises to perform satisfactorily in both gasoline and heavy-duty engines. It permits easy cold starts, and it has passed the Caterpillar Tractor Co. OL-1 and the Mack T-l tests and all of the SE/CD test requirements. Comprising a low-viscosity base stock blended with a V.l. improver and an improved detergent- inhibitor additive package that minimizes ring sticking, this oil is probably the forerunner of a series of SE/CD oils with even wider crossgradings. 740524. Ail-Year Commercial Oils. Theodore R. Mullen, William J. Lendener and Michael J. Frino, Cities Service Oil Co. A method based on apparent viscosity of engine oils at 0°F measured by the cold cranking simulator to estimate minimum starting temperatures for SAE "W" numbered engine oils is described. Based on apparent viscosity measurements, a non- polymer-containing SAE 20W-30 engine oil would satisfy 100% of gasoline- or diesel-engine powered fleets where temperatures are consistently above 0°F. Based on climate and vehicle distribution by geographical location, about 15% of gasoline engine powered vehicles require engine oils with low-temperature properties found in SAE 5 W or SAE 10W engine oils. Diesel engines using a nonpolymer-containing SAE 20W-30 engine oil would obtain the benefits of SAE 20W low-temperature starting properties and SAE 30 high-temperature protection. Initial field tests of gasoline-powered vehicles in severe winter service indicate adequate low-temperature prop- erties for a nonpolymer-containing SAE 20W-30 engine oil compared to an SAE 20W-20 grade normally used in this application in winter. This method may also be used to compare low-temperature properties of engine oils containing different V.l. improvers 740525. Diesel Engine Oil Consumption Studies. W. C. Gergel and J. E. Riester, Lubrizol Corp. An oil consumption test procedure has been developed in a 6-cyl, 425 hp, turbocharged and after-cooled diesel engine. Tests conducted on reference oils agree with good and poor oil consumption characteristics found with these same oils in the field. This paper includes evaluations using the engine test procedure as well as various laboratory bench tests which measure the effects of viscosity, volatility, and oxidation stability. Both bench and engine test results indicate that traditional properties, such as viscosity and volatility, do not completely account for variations in oil consumption. The data indicate that the problem of obtaining low diesel engine oil consumption may involve a complex combi- nation of factors. 1974 SAE Transactions 740526. The Development of Techniques to Measure Vehicle Spray on Wet Roads. Thomas E. Ritter, Southwest Research Institute. Several techniques have been developed to measure the relative amount of splash and spray produced by vehicles when driven on wet roads at highway speeds under controlled conditions. This paper discusses considerations in the development of measurement techniques such as those utilizing photographs, a photometer, densitometer, spraymeter, and spray collector. The development of each technique is described. Some test data utilizing the photometer and densitometer techniques are presented in a comparison of two different trucks run on two different road surfaces with new and worn tires, fully loaded and unloaded, and under light and heavy road moisture conditions. 1974 SAE Transactions 740527. Effect of Temperature on Exhaust Emissions. L. Grinberg and L. Morgan, Shell Canada Ltd. A program has been completed to study the effects of ambient temperature on exhaust emissions. It consisted of determining the cold start emission levels of two late model passenger cars at temperatures of 70, 40, and -10°F with two test fuels of different midrange volatility characteristics. The ambient temperature was found to have a pronounced effect on exhaust emissions. A reduction of 112</page><page sequence="72">740527-740534 the test temperature from 70 to -10° F resulted in a manyfold increase in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Most of this increase in emissions, as well as an associated deterioration in fuel economy, occurred during the initial 5 min period after a cold start. The ambient temperature was found to have no major effect on the levels of pollutants emitted during the fully warmed-up operation of cars. Relative to the effects of ambient temperature and the vehicle characteristics, the midrange volatility of the fuel was concluded to have only a minor effect on exhaust emissions. 740529. Effects of Combustion Chamber Shape and Spark Location on Exhaust Nitric Oxide and Hydro- carbon Emissions. J. T. Wentworth, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The effects of combustion chamber shape and spark location on exhaust NO and HC emissions were inves- tigated using a single-cylinder, 4-stroke, reciprocating, spark ignition engine. A total of 21 spark locations were evaluated in three combustion chamber configurations. The chamber shapes included a modified wedge, a disc, and a modified hemisphere. The engine was operated at constant speed and airflow, with optimum spark timing and peak NO air-fuel ratio. Both combustion chamber shape and spark location had substantial effects on NO and HC emissions. Deductive prediction of these effects was not possible due to incomplete knowledge of the patterns of pollutant distribution and mixture movements within the combus- tion chamber. It is recommended that chamber shape and spark location effects be evaluated experimentally in any new engine design. 1974 SA E Transactions 740530. Some Diesel Exhaust Reactivity Information Derived by Gas Chromatography. E. W. Landen and J. M. Perez, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Chromatographic analysis of diesel exhaust indicates a number of low molecular weight hydrocarbons, below C6. Using reactivity index as a criterion, much of the diesel exhaust reactivity can be attributed to ethylene and propylene caused by the thermal decomposition of the fuel. Hydrocarbons in the C4-Cld7 range, including high relative reactivity olefins, are generally low in volume concentration and therefore contribute little to the overall exhaust reactivity. Hydrocarbons, in terms of parts per million carbon above C7 are low in present diesel engine designs, so individual volume concentrations are generally fractional parts per million. Reactivity per horsepower- hour from diesel engine exhaust is less than that from the one small industrial gasoline engine tested by the heavy-duty truck diesel engine cycle. It is questionable if diesel engine hydrocarbons from well-designed engines need be controlled below present levels to reduce smog in metropolitan areas, especially since diesel engines burn less than 10% of the total vehicle fuel used. 1974 SA E Transactions 740531. Effect of Imposed Faults on a Distributor Injec- tion System. N. A. Henein and T. Singh, Wayne State University. The effects of several faults on different parameters in a distributor injection system are studied both theoretically and experimentally. The faults imposed on a healthy system are: fuel leaks between the pump and injector, a broken or missing injector spring, plugged nozzle holes, and a stuck-closed needle. The injector parameters examined include maximum fuel pressures reached at different locations in the system, needle lift, injection lag, and injection rate. 740532. Application of Automatic Test Equipment to Bus Maintenance. J. M. Laskey and R. F. Barry, RCA Corporation. A system for built-in instrumentation, applied to a fleet of bus vehicles, is evaluated as one element of a continuing program to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of bus maintenance operations. The evaluation study concen- trated on a built-in instrumentation system, originally developed for military vehicles, in which the connections, sensors, and transducers required for test and diagnosis are permanently installed on a vehicle and terminated in a single "diagnostic" connector. Testing is accomplished by connecting analytic instrumentation to the diagnostic connector. Several designs of analytic instruments exist which provide for varying degrees of test compre- hensiveness. This paper describes the peculiarities of bus main- tenance, the evaluation process, tradeoffs related to test system requirements versus benefits derived, and how the instrumentation system design was tailored from a military to a commercial application. The results of the evaluation are presented along with a review of other consideration factors including fuel shortage, fleet capital investment spiral, and cost and availability of mainte- nance personnel. 1974 SA E Transactions 740534. A Diagnostic System for Vehicles Based on the Monitoring of Off-Normal Conditions During Day-to-Day Operations. H. B. Rath, Mack Trucks, Inc. Vehicle diagnostic systems have been proposed which are based on the interrogation of a series of sensors located at critical points of the vehicle by an automatic check-out device which is a part of the service shop equipment. At least one system of this type already is in use on an imported passenger car. Systems also are in existence which provide a series of alarms to warn the operator of certain off-normal conditions which may occur during daily vehicle operation. Many off-normal conditions thus alarmed may never be reported because they are of a 113</page><page sequence="73">740534-740540 momentary or intermittent nature. This type of condition rarely can be detected by means of a checkout on the floor of the service shop. The diagnostic system described monitors off-normal conditions as they occur during day-to-day operation and provides a record of them for use by maintenance people. The simplest form of the system provides only a count of the number of occur- rences. A more sophisticated form of the system provides a record of magnitude and duration with a real time base. A modified tachograph has been used in a basic system. A printer or magnetic recording also may be used. 740535. The Practical Application of Lubricant Testing to Equipment Maintenance. Jack Poley, Analysts, Inc. This paper discusses attendant problems in achieving full benefits from an oil analysis program. The problems of oil sample collection and retrieval of sample data are covered. Heavy emphasis is placed on spectrometric testing for metallic oil constituents, while meaningful physical tests are selected according to equipment type. The technique and rationale of data analysis and the conditional statement of equipment and lubricant condition based upon the oil analysis are discussed at length. Continuous sampling is an important aspect of a good oil analysis program. The laboratory is viewed as a consultant to the end user and the responsibilities of each toward a successful program are underscored. 740536. Aggregate Emissions from the Automobile Pop- ulation. John B. Heywood and Michael K. Martin, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A methodology is presented with which aggregate emis- sions from the in-use automobile population can be calculated for any given calendar year. The data base needed for such a calculation is discussed, and areas in which further research is needed are pointed out. Results of a series of calculations are then presented showing the effect on aggregate emissions of various control strategies. The effects of an inspection/maintenance and retrofit program, different vehicle population growth rates, cata- lyst deterioration in use, and various schedules of new car emission standards for post- 1975 vehicles are presented. It is shown that the rate at which oil, higher-polluting vehicles are retired from the in-use vehicle population is the major factor in determining the rate at which aggregate emissions will decrease in the 1970s, with the precise level of post- 1975 standards only becoming important in the 1980s. 1974 SA E Transactions 740537. Emissions and Fuel Usage by the U. S. Truck and Bus Population and Strategies for Achieving Reductions. Daniel S. Tingley and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological University. This paper presents an approach to modeling the United States truck and bus population. A detailed model is developed that utilizes domestic factory sales figures combined with a scrappage factor as a building block for the total population. Comparison with historical data for 1958-1970 shows that the model follows trends well for intermediate parameters such as total vehicle miles per year, total fuel consumption, scrappage, etc. Fuel consumption and HC, CO, N02, C02 and particulate matter emissions for gasoline and diesel engines are of primary interest. The model details these parameters for the time span 1958-2000 in one-year increments. For HC and CO, truck and bus emissions could equal or exceed automobile emissions in the early 1980s, depending on the degree of control. Three population control strategies are analyzed to determine their effects on reducing fuel consumption or air pollution in later years. It is concluded that a combination of the three strategies, substitution of diesel engines for gasoline engines in new vehicles, field retrofit of pre- 1968 vehicles, and more stringent emissions restrictions would result in the greatest reductions of fuel consumption and emissions in future years.

Domke, Environmental Protection Agency. A mathematical model of an automobile's emission rate is described. This model can be used to calculate the amounts of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen emitted by individual or groups of automo- biles being driven over any known driving sequence. The development of the model requires the amounts of three pollutants given off by individual automobiles over short duration driving sequences (modes). The validity of the model is investigated by using it to calculate the amounts of each pollutant given off by individual automobiles over the hot transient portion (first 505 s) of the Federal Test Procedure driving sequence. These predicted emissions are then compared with observed amounts emitted from each automobile. Further, the ability of the model to predict emissions is investigated in light of the reproducibility of actual automobile emissions measured in replicated tests. These analyses indicate that the model performs extremely well. The model is intended to be used to predict emissions from automobiles being operated within the ranges of speed and acceleration covered in the input emission data. 740540. Effects of Engine Oil Supply on Rocker Arm and Ball Wear. Chester K. Murphy, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Wear of engine components is affected by lubricant quality and flow and by the metallurgy of the rubbing parts. Recent studies have shown that after starting an engine at sub-zero temperatures, more than 6 min elapsed before oil reached all of the rocker arm assemblies of a 114</page><page sequence="74">740540-740549 V-8 engine. Since this could have an adverse effect on rocker arm and ball wear, the effects of intermittent and zero oil flow on rocker arm and ball wear were inves- tigated. The metallurgy of the rocker balls influenced ball wear greatly. Even when run for 9 h with no oil flowing to them sintered iron alloy balls had very little scuffing or wear, whereas sintered iron balls were heavily scuffed and worn. In addition, the imprégnant used in sintered iron alloy balls influenced wear. With one type of organo- phosphorus imprégnant, excessive scuffing and wear was observed, whereas with another organophosphorus and an oleic acid imprégnant, little wear and no scuffing were found. 740541. Cold Pumpability Characteristics of Engine Oils Predicted by a Bench Test. C. R. Spohn and R. M. Stewart, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co. The cold pumpability characteristics of nine commercial crankcase oils were evaluated using a V-8 engine and a bench test. These nine oils included most of the SAE viscosity classifications. The engine data were used for evaluating the ability of the bench test to predict the cold pumpability properties of crankcase oils. Additional tests were conducted to study some unusual cold pumping properties of two of the oils. One of these oils was very soak-time sensitive, while the other was found to improve in pumpability after only brief use in the test engine.

Jun-ichi Kawamoto, Masago Yamamoto and Yasuo Ito, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). In the measurement of engine oil consumption, the conventional radiometric method is more rapid and precise than the drain-weight method, but the former method - a batch type - is inapplicable to measurements in transient engine operations which are inevitable in real driving. In the present study, a reliable method was developed to measure continuously the consumption rate through all phases of engine operation. Oleic acid sulfide containing S35 was selected as a radioactive tracer to be added to the engine oil. Engine exhaust gas containing the discharged oil was burned in an electric furnace and a gas burner and reacted with aqueous H202 solution, converting the S3502 into H2S3504. A plastic bead scin- tillator used for the detection of /J-rays from the aqueous solution was sensitive enough to measure the consumption rate as low as 0.4 g/h. Some informative observations were also made on the oil consumption of the engine in transient and steady-state operations by use of this new measurement system. 740544. Rationale for the Regulation of Interstate Motor Carrier Noise. William H. Close, Office of Noise Abatement, U. S. Dept. of Trans. This paper analyzes the rationale behind the federal regulation of interstate motor carrier noise. At highway speeds, tire noise is frequently predominant. At low speeds, engine-related noise is predominant. The effects of both these noise sources are considered. The question of enforceability of the regulation is also discussed. 740545. Cold Weather Starting Problems. Douglas An- drew, Dominion Consolidated Truck Lines; and Stephen A. Schuster, Schuster Express, Inc. A discussion of the cold weather starting problems confronting the fleet operator, this paper focuses on the importance of establishing proper vehicle specifications for the intended operating environment. Difficulties such as choosing performance level, knowing and describing operating conditions, determining durability level, and approving installation are covered. Also included is an examination of some starting aids for both gasoline and diesel engines such as the proper motor oil, starting technique, and the addition of starting ether. The importance of an efficient follow-up maintenance pro- gram once specifications have been established is stressed. 740547. Installation of Optional Equipment for Cold Weather Starting in Emergency Conditions. Orner M. Germundson, Otter Tail Power Co. In order for a power company fleet to be effective in its operations it must maintain a high level of fleet availa- bility. In the northern part of the country, this is closely related to cold weather starting. Practices have been established and equipment introduced to combat cold weather problems. These are discussed, along with the implementation costs involved. 740548. Keys to Successful Air Starting and Maintenance. R. J. Sargent, Indianhead Truck Line, Inc. After a somewhat unsuccessful birth, air starting has proved to be an efficient, low cost method of starting diesel engines in cold weather. Despite the problems of poor installation, bad connections, under-capacity tanks, and water in the air, steps can be taken to ensure the system's success. This paper analyzes the problems and merits of the air starting system and presents specific suggestions on ways to minimize or eliminate the diffi- culties involved in its implementation. The attendant problems of noise level and consumer education are discussed. Suggestions for the maintenance of air starting systems are included. 1974 SAE Transactions 740549. Engine Heaters - First Aid for Cold Weather Starting. John M. Sukala, J. Jeb Mfg. Co.; and Norman Deckard, K &amp; R Delivery, Inc. This paper outlines how the use of engine heaters will aid the fleet operator by reducing vehicle downtime and starting costs in cold weather and by extending engine life. The advantages of such heaters and their costs are discussed. The types of heaters (in-block immersion, 115</page><page sequence="75">740549-740562 electrically powered tank type, oil or gas heated tank type, and hot-water circulatory system) are described in detail, with the relative cost of each. The problems inherent in such heaters are mentioned, along with the corrective steps to be taken. 740550. Electronic Auditing for Equipment Management. Harry E. Burke, Electroaudit, Inc. For management to realize the maximum economic benefits from its equipment, it is necessary to know exactly how that equipment is being used. Electronic auditing, using a new, low-cost event recorder, provides a method of obtaining actual operating data from equip- ment in a form acceptable to a digital computer con- taining the mathematical model for the equipment management program. 740551. Automatic Stabilization of Tractor Jackknifing in Tractor- Semitrailer Trucks. Enrique Alfonso Susemihl, Universidad Nacional del Sur (Ar- gentina); and Allan I. Krauter, Cornell Univer- sity. This paper describes an automatic stabilizing technique to prevent tractor jackknifing in tractor-semitrailer trucks. This stabilizing technique consists of the detection of the onset of a jackknife and the subsequent application of corrective action. The onset of a jackknife is detected through the behavior of the drive wheels, and the corrective action consists of a form of corrective braking; that is, the simultaneous operation of the antiskid systems at all axles of the truck. The results obtained in this study indicate that the stabilizing technique may effectively prevent the development of a tractor jackknife during braking. Furthermore, the implementation of this tech- nique in a real truck would be relatively simple and require a minimum of additional hardware. 1974 SA E Transactions 740552. Integrating Manufacturing and Product Design Information for Selection of HSLA Steel. R. Heimbuch and F. Schierloh, Manufacturing Development, General Motors Corporation. Several new HSLA steels have become commercially available over the past year. The materials were intro- duced with inadequate data describing their properties, even though they differed from conventional 1008-1010. This paper specifies a list of material characteristics which are needed in selecting these new HSLA. The list includes design properties, manufacturing properties and com- mercial factors. Laboratory tests are specified for meas- uring the properties of interest. 740560. Evaluating Copper Alloy Brake Discs by Thermal Modeling. L. L. Hartter, H. W. Schwartz and S. K. Rhee, Bendix Research Labs. Past work has shown that brake discs constructed of a copper alloy containing 1% chromium can significantly reduce temperatures at the sliding interface. The purpose of this investigation was to demonstrate this friction further, and specifically to determine how copper discs should be configured to provide desired temperature response with a minimum amount of material. To accomplish this objective, an analytical thermal model was developed of a disc design for heavy trucks. The model employed the finite difference approach, in which the disc was subdivided into a number of small volumes. The model specifically simulated disc temper- ature response during 50 mph fade tests performed on a dynamometer. The thermal model was correlated with test data to verify and improve its accuracy, and then utilized to evaluate the effects of material and geometry changes. Results show that mass concentration in the disc faces yields lower temperatures at the friction interface, par- ticularly during the first several stops. In fact, thickness of the vanes and hub might be reduced to conserve copper, as long as stress levels are adequate. Even after a large number of successive stops, temperature cycling would be less extreme with thicker faces. A chromium copper disc with a cast iron hub is one possibility for minimizing copper requirements. The study has demonstrated that thermal modeling is a valid and potentially valuable tool in the design optimization of brake discs. Indeed, the analytical approach, combining both thermal and stress analyses, along with prototype testing, may prove the most effective method for future design development of disc brakes. 1974 SA E Transactions 740561. Energy and Emission Control. T. V. DePalma, Vladimir Haensel, M. J. Sterba and J. E. Thoss, Universal Oil Products Co. New cars represent a deliberate choice to lower emissions at the expense of fuel economy. This paper considers the compatibility of emission control and gasoline conser- vation for the automotive vehicle. It concludes that the use of catalytic converters in combination with higher ratio compression engines will allow us to regain pre- emission control fuel economy. 740562. International View of Tractor Seating. Arthur O. Radke, UOP Bostrom (U.K.) Ltd. This paper discusses the importance of seating in pro- tecting tractor operators from shock and vibration. An overview of important seating criteria is presented and U.S. and European viewpoints are compared. The U.S. and Europe have pursued somewhat different paths in regard to seat evaluation and selection. In 1969, the Off-Highway Council established the Joint Seating Subcommittee reporting to the Tractor Technical Committee and the Construction &amp; Industrial Machinery Technical Committee, to review information in these areas and to develop appropriate recommended practices. The activities of this Subcommittee are reported and suggestions for future work are outlined. 116</page><page sequence="76">740563-740567 740563. Texaco's Stratified Charge Engine - Multifuel, Efficient, Clean, and Practical. M. Alperstein, G. H. Schafer and F. J. Villforth, III, Texaco, Inc. This paper reports on the continuing development of Texaco's stratified charge engine combustion concept, the Texaco Controlled-Combustion System. TCCS conver- sions of the military L-141 engine have demonstrated inherently low exhaust emissions, multifuel capability, and improved fuel economy over the carburetted L-141 gasoline engine. Under contract to the U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command, promulgated federal gaseous exhaust emis- sions standards were met in a naturally aspirated TCCS engine-powered M-151 vehicle equipped with EGR- and Texaco-developed exhaust catalysts. These low emissions were sustained for 50,000 miles (80,400 km) with moderate maintenance. The effects of different degrees of emission control and of multifuel operation on performance and fuel economy were characterized using a turbocharged L-141 TCCS engine-powered M-151 vehicle. 740564. Automotive Emissions of Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons. George P. Gross, Exxon Re- search and Engineering Company, Linden, N.J. Automotive exhaust emissions of polynuclear aromatic (C16+) hydrocarbons (PNA) were reduced by 65-70% by current emissions control systems and by about 99% by two experimental advanced emission control systems. At a given level of emission control, PNA emission was primarily controlled by fuel PNA content through the transient storage of PNA in engine deposits and their later emission under more severe engine operating conditions. A relatively minor contribution to PNA emission was made by PNA synthesized from lower molecular weight fuel aromatics, particularly C10-C14 aromatics. Deposit-related PNA emissions were linearly corre- lated with the PNA content of the deposit formation fuel. In comparison with a fuel of field-average PNA content (0.5 ppm benzo(a)pyrene), a field-maximum fuel (3 ppm) contained 4 to 7 times as much of three major PNA species and caused 3 to 5 times higher emissions of these species. PNA equivalent to 4 to 12% of the PNA present in consumed fuel accumulated in used engine oil, but the accumulation of PNA in engine oil did not cause a measurable increase in exhaust PNA emissions under normal oil consumption conditions. Large increases in PNA emission occurred when oil consumption was artificially increased to very high levels. Partial loss of some PNA species occurred by chemical reactions in the collection system. From 52% to 58% of the emitted benzo(a)pyrene and benz(a)anthracene and their alkyl derivatives were lost, but other, less reactive PNA species were not lost. Conclusions as to the relative effects of variables on PNA emission are not affected. 1974 SA E Transactions 740565. (P-53) Energy Basis for Collision Severity. Kenneth L. Campbell, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper presents an objective technique for estimating the severity of automobile collisions. The vehicle damage and the dynamic force-deflection characteristics of the vehicle structure are used to estimate the energy absorbed in plastic deformation of the vehicle. This energy can then be expressed as an "equivalent barrier speed" (EBS). The development is limited to frontal damage, although the technique is general and could be extended to side and rear damage. Data are presented relating residual crush and impact speed for full frontal barrier tests to provide the basis for a simple model of the force-deflection characteristics of the vehicle front structure. EBS is then estimated by inte- grating this force-deflection characteristic over the de- formation of the field vehicle. The results of this model are compared with test data to indicate the types of damage patterns for which the model appears valid. Calculations are made for damage patterns resembling angle and offset barrier impacts, and the computed EBS is compared with the actual impact speed. For both types of test, the errors seem within normal test variability. 1974 SA E Transactions 740566. (P-53) Automotive Recorder Research - A Summary of Accident Data and Test Results. Stephen S. Teel, Steven J. Peirce and Norman W. Lutkefedder, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

From these acceleration his- tories (recorded on a magnetic disc), velocity/time histories and velocity change during impact are derived to provide measures of vehicle crash severity. The purpose of developing these recorders is to provide accurate and quantitative relationships of vehicle crash severity with occupant fatalities and serious injuries from real-world accidents. To date, a total of 1200 disc recorders has been produced, approximately 1050 recorders have been in- stalled in fleet vehicles, and 23 accident records have been analyzed. This paper has been prepared to present the progress made in the Disc Recorder Pilot Project as of March 31, 1974. Recorder data from accidents involving vehicles equipped with disc recorders will be discussed and compared with associated reports by accident investi- gators. Also, crash tests to which the disc recorders have been subjected will be described along with an evaluation of results. Because of the recorder accuracy confirmed by these tests under different speeds and conditions, we are fully confident that the disc recorders are valid instru- ments for measuring vehicle crash severity. 1974 SA E Transactions 740567. (P-53) An Inexpensive Automobile Crash Re- 117</page><page sequence="77">740567-740572 corder. Charles Y. Warner and Joseph C. Free, Brigham Young University; Brian Wilcox and Donald Friedman, Minicars, Inc. One of the greatest challenges faced in the design of realistic occupant protection systems is an accurate statistical model of what is really needed. The paucity of data in this realm hinders designers of standards alike. Ideally, a model of crash statistics would correlate, for significant accident modes, injury level (as measured by AMA Abbreviated Injury Scale "AIS") with some adequate measure of crash intensity. Having this infor- mation, not only could the required level of safety design be ascertained, but also the justifiable economic expen- diture could be estimated. This paper treats the statistical basis for deployment of a data retrieval system. It provides a basis for estimates of the amount of data required, the number of vehicle to be instrumented, the crash severity trigger levels, and the economics of recorder installation, for various levels of injury and fatality. Results are presented in graph of time required to achieve N data points versus time value of expected data, as applied to current U.S. statistical information. The paper concludes with a brief outline of one feasible system for crash data recording and retrieval. 740568. (P-53) First Results of Exact Accident Data Acquisition on Scene. Ulrich N. Wanderer and Heinz M. Weber, Berlin Technical University. For one year now, an interdisciplinary team (engineers, physicians and a psychologist) has been working on an analysis of accident occurences, in Hannover. The accident causes, proceedings and consequences should be analyzed by as precise and accurate methods of data acquisition as possible on the scene of the accident. First results show that only 36% of the accident causes could have been avoided or at least reduced. The remaining 64% of the accidents were based on human failings which cannot be changed or only changed with great difficulty. The analysis of accidents involving pedestrians showed that the more serious injuries were due to the impact with the vehicle and not the road surface. 740569. (P-53) In-Depth Accident Data and Occupant Protection - A Statistical Point of View. James O'Day, Highway Safety Research Inst., The Univ. of Michigan. The current federal accident data collection system is inadequate. It does not produce representative data essential for answering cause-and-effect questions con- cerning accidents, injuries, and fatalities, and it does not produce adequate data essential for conducting cost- benefit analyses of changes in vehicle designs, highway designs, or driver licensing policies. A proposed federal data collection system (SIR) can solve those problems at a total cost of about 6 million dollars a year. The SIR system would include 30 investigating teams precisely located throughout the U.S., and would include a Sampling program, an In-depth program, and a Rapid- response program. The sooner this system is established, the sooner government and industry will begin to obtain accurate and reliable answers to pressing questions in the field of highway safety. 740570. (P-53) Development of Energy Absorbing Au- tomotive Structures Using Scale Model Test Techniques. Michael J. Pavlick, The Budd Co. To reduce the cost of developing energy absorbing structures for passenger cars and trucks, scale model test methods have developed. The scaling relationships needed to relate scale models to full size structures have been formulated and a test program conducted to validate the relationships and develop scaling factors. A 30 ft drop tower facility was constructed to conduct the test program. The tower allows impact velocities as high as 30 mph to be achieved and provides the necessary instru- mentation to obtain the crushing loads and crushing mode of the scale model specimens. The scale model test techniques and the drop tower were used to develop an energy absorbing frame for a light van type vehicle. Scale models were fabricated representing a number of possible design configurations. The models were tested and the design which best satisfied the design goals was further developed and tested. A brief description of an upgraded drop tower facility is also presented. 740571. (P-53) Front End Structures Crash Response Characterization. L. M. Shaw, G. F. Brammeier and R. L. Anderson, Ultrasystems, Inc. This paper summarizes the results of a research program, performed by Ultrasystems, Inc. and funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop and improve methods for characterizing auto- mobile front end structures. Computer simulations of each structure and crash environment were conducted using an existing computer simulation program. Two front end structures, a ramped fixed-force system and a variable stroke velocity-sensitive system, were incorporated into bogey vehicles which were crash-tested into a rigid barrier, a variable rigidity barrier, each other, and production vehicle front structures. These test results provided data by which computer simulation of the crash conditions were verified, providing a high degree of confidence in analytical representation of the structural crash responses. The empirical data were extended to other crash envi- ronments using the computer simulation techniques. 740572. (P-53) Crash Energy Management in Sub- compact Automobiles. Patrick M. Miller, Melvin O. Ryder, Jr. and Norris E. Shoemaker, Calspan Corp. Research programs conducted at Calspan to improve structural crashworthiness of subcompact cars are de- scribed. In two separate but related investigations, front 118</page><page sequence="78">740572-740577 structural designs intended to improve crash energy management were developed and adapted to a Datsun 510 and Chevrolet Vega. The prototype structure developed for the Datsun 510 was nominally consistent with present production man- ufacturing techniques and did not interfere with normal packaging requirements. This prototype design was evaluated through a series of 50 mph (80 km/h) flat barrier tests. Excellent passenger compartment integrity and crash energy management was demonstrated for this prototype automobile. The structural system developed for the Chevrolet Vega was similar in concept to that of the Datsun; but manufacturing requirements were relaxed in this effort. The design was tested in a series of 60 mph (96 km/h) frontal pole barrier impacts and 80 mph (129 km/h) closing speed vehicular collisions with a production standard size automobile. The results indicated substan- tial improvement over performance obtained from iden- tical tests with conventional automobiles. Finally, the problem of providing crash energy management in small cars is contrasted with that of standard size cars. The trade-off in this range of car size becomes one of smaller dimensional changes resulting in substantial changes in vehicular weight and kinetic energy. Results demonstrate that crash energy is more easily managed in the subcompact class automobile. 740573. (P-53) Theoretical and Experimental Investi- gations on the Crashworthiness of Small Cars. Harald J. Schimkat, Volkswagen werk AG. The philosophy, development, and optimization of two Volkswagen experimental safety vehicles are presented: the ESVW I and the ESVW II. The optimization processes for crashworthiness and occupant restraints are discussed with respect to efficiency and to cost/benefit considerations. 740574. (P-53) BARBI, A New Radar Concept for Precollision Sensing. Gerald F. Ross, Sperry Rand Corp. This paper describes a novel and low-cost scheme for automotive precollision sensing called BARBI, an acro- nym for BAseband Radar Bag Initiator. An extension of this technique is also suggested for braking applications. The proposed technique involves the transmission and reception of a subnanosecond baseband or video im- pulse-like signal (i.e., no RF carrier) and requires virtually no microwave components. The very fast signal risetime permits leading edge resolution on approaching vehicles of much less than a foot; closing velocity]is obtained by using range-rate techniques. By incorporating sequential range gating techniques, the false alarm rate can be reduced to less than one in ten years for all the cars in the U. S. today. 740575. (P-53) Fluid Crash Sensor. Sakio Ikeda, Kohei Nonaka and Masayoshi Fukushima, Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. A new crash sensor, using the electromagnetic effect of flowing electric-conductive liquid, has been developed. This sensor consists of mercury as electric-conductive liquid, permanent magnet, Y-shape liquid passage, elec- trodes detecting liquid velocity, multihollow fibres as a G'level setting method, nonreturn ball valve, electronic voltage amplifier, comparator, and thyrister switches. This sensor shows short-time crash discrimination and high reliability. 1974 SA E Transactions 740576. (P-53) The Development of an Air Bag on Collapsible Dashpanel Restraint System for Right Front Seat Occupants. Norris E. Shoemaker and David J. Biss, Calspan Corp. An air bag on collapsible dashpanel (ABCD) passive restraint system concept was researched, developed, and demonstrated at Calspan. Elements of the ABCD system are: a collapsible dashpanel which is positioned within steering wheel distance or greater of the occupant to absorb the primary portion of the kinetic energy of the occupant-vehicle interaction, and two small air bags which deploy at speeds above 20 mph, to distribute chest contact forces and control head motions. A crushable kneebar is used for lower torso restraint. The Calspan 3-D Crash Victim Simulation was used as a preliminary design tool in developing the concept. Component tests of the collapsible dashpanel were conducted on the Calspan linear accelerator impactor. Sled tests were conducted to refine the restraint system design and to evaluate the performance of the restraint system with respect to accepted injury criteria. Satisfactory restraint system performance was demonstrated for the 50 lb child at 40 mph and the 50th percentile male at 50 mph. Perform- ance for the 95th percentile male at 45 mph was marginal. The ABCD concept was demonstrated to be a feasible passive restraint system which shows promise for im- proving occupant protection for the range of occupant sizes from the 50 lb child through the 95th percentile male. 740577. (P-53) Study on Air Bag Systems for Nissan Small-Sized Cars. Fumiyuki Abe and Shohzo Satoh, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper outlines the most important characteristics of the practical type air bag now being developed by Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. It explains the results of various occupant protection tests conducted at 16-64 km/h (10-40 mph) speeds, and the related problems we have encountered. It further discusses the effects of several type of occupant protection systems installed on small-sized cars and the relationships between those effects and limited crash speeds. An examination and analysis of air bag per- formance test results is also included. Despite all efforts made, there yet remain several problems to be solved. For example, (a) in high-speed collisions it is difficult to reduce femur load by means of air bag systems alone; (b) passengers such as three- 119</page><page sequence="79">740577-740582 year-old infants and 5th percentile female adults display a tendency toward submarining; (c) when the environ- mental temperature is extremely low, it is difficult for the air bag to meet the MVSS Occupant Protection Require- ments. 1974 SA E Transactions 740578. (P-53) Human Volunteer and Anthropomorphic Dummy Tests of General Motors Driver Air Cushion System. George R. Smith, Emery C. Gulash and Roy G. Baker, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. Dynamic tests of the General Motors driver air cushion system using human volunteers were conducted at Southwest Research Institute. Forty human tests were conducted at eight different impact severities. Thirty-two anthropomorphic dummy tests were made under similar conditions. The test work proceeded as planned through impacts equivalent to a 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash of a full size vehicle. No significant injuries were experienced by the volunteers. The extent of trauma was generally limited to minor abrasions, ecchymosis, and erythema. In comparable tests, the anthropomorphic dummies' re- sponse to impact was more exaggerated than the humans'. 1974 SA E Transactions 740579. (P-53) Anthropomorphic Dummy and Human Volunteer Tests of Advanced and/or Passive Belt Restraint Systems. Thomas H. Glenn, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Research Institute of NHTSA has been conducting dynamic sled tests of advanced and/or passive belt restraint systems for compact or subcompact cars. Phase I tests using dummies have been completed for eleven systems which were submitted by six different manu- facturers. Test results are reported. Phase II tests using volunteer human subjects are now in progress for systems which generated good perform- ance data during Phase I tests. The results of human tests of the first system have been very encouraging. Successful injury-free tests of one volunteer subject have been completed with a maximum attained velocity of 30.4 mph (48.9 km/h) at an acceleration level of 21.1 G. Only the results taken from "quick look" preliminary data are reported. Suggestions are made for additional research, devel- opment, and test efforts to optimize the performance characteristics of future belt restraint systems and to improve their comfort and convenience. 1974 SA E Transactions 740580. (P-53) The Efforts of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the Development of Advanced Passive Protection Systems and Child Restraint Systems. Charles E. Strother and Richard M. Morgan, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This report presents an overview of the occupant pack- aging research program within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The report discusses the program's efforts to establish the feasibilities of practical methods for providing the highest levels of occupant protection. In the area of frontal impact protection, work is progressing on advanced driver air bag systems, on a bag and bolster approach to passenger protection, on the development of improved inflation techniques for in- flatables and on the passive application of the air belt concept. Efforts in the other areas of side, rear, and rollover protection are discussed as are NHTSA's efforts in child restraint research. 740581. (P-53) Development of Energy-Absorbing Safety Belt Webbing. Juichiro Takada, Taka ta Kojyo Co., Ltd. Seat belt systems can be considered as the most conven- ient and practical system for occupant protection in automotive crash situations. Takata Kojyo Co., Ltd. has been striving to design and create a seat belt system that would be both practical and effective in absorbing impact energy with no injury in high speed crashes. In our search for more effective seat belt systems, we have conducted various comparison tests between con- ventional webbings and our newly developed webbing in regard to rheological property. 1. In regard to the dynamic performance of the webbing, the quantity of absorbed impact energy and the rate of absorbing energy were obtained and compared through tests at various impact speeds. 2. Dummy tests were conducted in our laboratories to compare the improved Takata energy-absorbing (EA) webbing with conventional webbing. The results showed the conspicuous superiority of the Takata webbing over the conventional types. 3. Using our improved webbing, two live human volunteers were able to successfully complete tests at impact speeds of 30.3 and 30.4 mph without injury or pain. 4. In the future, to enhance safety, seat belts, as well as other restraint systems, should be evaluated with the use of dynamic tests with living human volunteer subjects rather than with anthropomorphic dummies. 1974 SA E Transactions 740582. (P-53) A Force Limiting System on a Three- Point-Belt System Depending on Crash Velocity. Dieter Adomeit, Berlin Technical University. This force limiter produces a belt force so that at the maximum requested crash-velocity and each lower one the maximum possible relative forward displacement between passenger and vehicle will be nearly used. Thereby, the passenger loads by the belt will be reduced, as well as the decelerations effecting the passenger, at a lower than the maximum requested crash-velocities in accident statistics, injuries by the belt will be effectively reduced, mainly for 120</page><page sequence="80">740582-740588 people of fragile constitution. The principle of the force limiter is a hydraulic throttling member. Due to the relative speed between the passenger and the vehicle the force limiter produces a belt-force according to its F-vrel -ratio. The proceeding is: 1. The mathematical analogue-digital simulation of a simplified passenger-vehicle-model in order to get an optimized F-vrel-ratio of the force limiter. 2. Construction of a test unit of a force limiter to approximate the theoretical foundings by hardware. 740583. (P-53) Performance Matrices of Four Restraint Systems. Ulrich Seiffert and Wilfried Schwanz, Volkswagenwerk AG. For three given deceleration pulses of defined shape and peak magnitude, total velocity change was varied from 20-40 mph by changing duration of the pulse. Several restraint systems were compared, for these combinations of speed change and pulse shape, using head injury criterion, chest severity index, and femur loads to evaluate potential injury. Limit curves for each restraint are developed in terms of velocity change and peak decel- eration, and the significance of these curves is discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740584. (P-53) Improved Restraint for U. S. Army Aircrewmen. Richard W. Carr, Ultrasystems, Inc.; and W. J. Nolan, U. S. Army Air Mobility Res. &amp; Dev. Lab. This paper describes the evolution of a forward-facing aircrew restraint system which meets all test requirements, although static and dynamic test requirements were very demanding. The intent of the program was to develop a restraint system which would use the maximum amount of existing hardware. Modifications were needed in the lap belt retractor, double inertia reel, single-point release buckle, adjusters, and webbing. The systems also required more sophisticated and specialized testing procedures to assure adequate performance of the system. The results of the program described in detail, illustrate that a modern, restraint system for Army aircraft can be designed and developed with the current state- of-the-art. 1974 SA E Transactions 740585. (P-53) An Introduction to Scale Model Testing to Determine Air Cushion Crash Sensor Location. T. O. Jones and W. A. Elliott, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Design validation of crash sensors in the vehicle barrier impact environment is difficult and costly. The objective of this paper is to outline a method of developing optimum crash sensor mounting utilizing reduced-scale physical models. This technique incorporates design tools that are readily accessible during early vehicle concept stages which will allow mechanical impedance checks of the crash sensor to vehicle structure interface at signif- icantly lower cost than full size prototype testing. Basic equations and methodology are presented with experimental correlation data. 1974 SA E Transactions 740586. (P-53) Scale Modeling of Vehicle Crashes - Techniques, Applicability, and Accuracy; Cost Effectiveness. B. Samuel Holmes and George Sliter, Stanford Research Institute. The utility of scale model experiments for crashworthiness research is examined. In Part I, two examples illustrate the use of scale models in crashworthiness research. The accuracy of modeling is shown by direct comparison between a model experiment and the test of a complete automobile in high-speed impact. It is concluded that scale models can be used in place of full-scale experiments for many applications. The comparison of hydraulic and plastic deformation energy absorbers in scale model experiments demonstrates the ability of models to repro- duce the response of a wide variety of vehicle elements. In Part II, the cost effectiveness of scale modeling is measured by comparing the costs of full-scale experiments with scaled experiments that meet the same objectives. The comparisons include both individual tests of various types and complete vehicle development programs. It is concluded that scaled experiments increase the flexibility, reduce the cost, and hasten the completion of a program. 740587. (P-53) Test Sled Simulation of Crash Induced Yaw and Pitch. Acen Jordan, Minicars, Inc. This paper deals with the design concepts and devel- opment of a sled test compartment which exhibits yaw and pitch displacements as a function of the applied sled deceleration pulse. It outlines the program in which it was developed and notes the qualitative differences encoun- tered when testing with these additional motions as opposed to testing with a fixed sled compartment. 740588. (P-53) The Highway Safety Research Institute Dummy Compared with General Motors Bio- fidelity Recommendations and the Hybrid II Dummy. Raymond F. Neathery, Harold J. Mertz and Robert P. Hubbard, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp.; and Mark R. Henderson, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. Two Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) dummies were tested and evaluated. Based on the analysis given, the HSRI dummy should not be used for vehicle qualification testing. However, many of its components offer viable alternatives for future dummy development. The dummy was found to have inadequate bio- mechanical fidelity in the head, neck, and chest, although its characteristics were very promising and, as a whole, biomechanically superior to the Hybrid II. Its re- peatability and reproducibility in dynamic component tests were better than the Hybrid II dummy. In particular, the HSRI friction joints were outstanding in repeatability and had a significant advantage in usability in that they 121</page><page sequence="81">740588-740594 do not require resetting between tests. In three-point harness and ACRS systems tests, the values of injury criteria produced by the HSRI dummy were generally lower than those obtained with the Hybrid II, especially the femur loads in the ACRS tests. However, the repeatability and reproducibility of the HSRI dummy were significantly poorer than the Hybrid II. Also, significant durability problems exist with the skin and lumbar spine of the HSRI dummy. Discussion: Robert L. Hess and John W. Melvin, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. 1974 SA E Transactions 740589. (P-53) Human Chest Impact Protection Criteria. R. L. Stalnaker and D. Mohan, The University of Michigan. For safer design of restraint systems and vehicle interiors, experimental data has to be obtained to establish chest injury criteria. Unembalmed human cadavers were used to conduct 9 frontal and 14 lateral impacts. All impacts used a 6 in (15.2 cm) diameter impactor with impact velocities ranging 12-20 mph (19.3-32.2 km/h). Chest impacts were also conducted on rhesus monkeys and baboons to establish primate-human injury scaling cri- teria. Four human volunteers were used to obtain static load deflection curves in the lateral and frontal directions. The results of these and other experiments are presented and analyzed. The results indicate that muscle force and breath holding in live humans tends to make their chests stiffer than those of unembalmed human cadavers. Maximum forces ranged 500-1400 lb (2225-6230 N), maximum deflection 1.9-3.2 in (4.8-8.1 cm) and pulse duration 10-47 ms. Rib fractures were observed at the higher velocities around 29.3 ft/s (8.9 m/s). The results of dynamic as well as static tests indicated that maximum deflection and not maximum force is the determining factor for rib fractures. Both in the static and dynamic tests, rib fractures were more frequent at chest deflections of over 3 in (7.6 cm), whereas none occurred at deflections less than 2.3 in (5.8 cm). Chest impact protection criteria are suggested, both from the standpoint of restraint systems design and vehicle interior design for front and side collisions. 1974 SA E Transactions 740590.

Improvements in performance repeatability and reproducibility of the dummy are documented and the anthropomorphic and biomechanical basis of the design described. The development of repeatable testing pro- cedures and of dummy features that enhance the accuracy of the inital test setup are also discussed. 740592. Passenger Car Fuel Economy During Non-Urban Driving. Thomas C. Austin, Karl H. Hellman and C. Don Paulsell, Environmental Protection Agency. The use of fuel economy data from the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) has provided a substantial amount of data on the fuel economy of passenger cars in urban driving conditions. Since the FTP does not represent the type of driving done in rural areas, especially on highways, a driving cycle to assess highway fuel economy was a desirable supplement to the FTP. The new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) "highway" cycle was constructed from actual speed- versus-time traces generated by an instrumented test car driven over a variety of nonurban roads and highways. This cycle reflects the correct proportion of operation on each of the four major types of nonurban roads and preserves the nonsteady-state characteristics of real-world driving. The average speed of the cycle is 48.2 mph and the cycle length is 10.2 miles, close to the average nonurban trip length. Preliminary vehicle tests show that rotary and con- ventional engine-powered vehicles achieve approximately the same ratio of highway fuel economy to urban (FTP) fuel economy. Various unconventional engine-powered vehicles show different values for the ratio of highway to urban fuel economy. The continued use of the highway cycle will establish a data base which, when used in conjunction with FTP data, will allow better estimates of both fuel economy and exhaust emission trends. 1974 SA E Transactions 740593. The 1974 AMC Collegiate Fuel Economy Runs. Arthur C. Haman, University of Detroit. Paper describes three collegiate automobile runs spon- sored by American Motors Corp. to demonstrate that savings in fuel are possible when good driving practices are observed. Driving 1974 Gremlins, the young winners proved that "typical" drivers can in fact achieve econ- omies in fuel of the kind that are being sought nationally at the present time. Reduction of speed proved to be a major contributing factor. 740594. Fuel Economy Trends and Catalytic Devices. Robert C. Stempel and Stuart W. Martens, General Motors Corp. In 1968, a major oil company cancelled its annual automobile economy run after sponsoring it for 18 consecutive years - presumably due to lack of interest from the public and the press. Almost coincident with that cancellation was the beginning of production automobile exhaust emission control on a national basis and a downward inflection in the historic trend of automobile fuel economy. In contrast, the past year has seen a major revival of interest, by both the public and the press, in fuel economy. In the next few weeks, the nation will be introduced to a new direction in automotive exhaust 122</page><page sequence="82">740594-740600 emission control which will profoundly affect the fuel economy trend. Perhaps equally, or even more important, the next few months are expected to see major national decisions on future automobile emission control which will likely have a significant influence on the direction taken by automobile fuel economy a few years hence. It, therefore, appears most appropriate at this time to examine the present trend in automotive fuel economy as influenced by control of air pollutant emissions. 1974 SA E Transactions 740595. Diesel Fan Drives, Do They Save Fuel? Keith A. Boyd and Jim Easterly, Eaton Corp. A method for measuring diesel fuel consumption accu- rately over short distances of 5 miles or less was developed so that many fan-on, fan-off data sets could be gathered in a short time for statistical evaluation and analysis. A second test sequence involved fan-on, fan-off fuel econ- omy tests over a highway route for comparison against the Cummins Vehicle Mission Simulation Computer Program. The predicted results from this program agreed sub- stantially with the actual highway economy test data we obtained. More than 4 million charted miles of roads throughout the world are available through this program for predicting fan-off fuel savings. Results on several typical routes are given. 1974 SA E Transactions 740596. Comparison of Modulated (Viscous) versus On- Off Fan Clutches. Everett G. Blair, Wallace Murray Corp. Both the advent of the energy crisis and the regulation of noise levels are making fan drives highly desirable for heavy truck applications. This paper evaluates the reduc- tion of power drain and fan noise for two types of fan drives generally available today: the on-off air-activated clutch and the modulated viscous drive. In addition, the principles of operation, life, and application considera- tions are discussed. 740597. A Modulated Clutch for Vehicle Cooling System Fans - Why and How. Romas B. Spokas, Borg-Warner Corp. This paper presents a discussion of the modulating fan clutch which was chosen as a fan speed regulating device to improve the overall efficiency of the internal combus- tion engine. Generally the engine cooling system is oversized for normal operating conditions. With a fan speed regulating device providing the exact amount of airflow to maintain proper engine cooling temperature, the horsepower not required to turn the fan can be utilized for increased speed or fuel economy. This device also serves to reduce noise as the fan is one of the major contributors to this problem. Design goals and types of mechanisms considered are presented along with results of component and system testing of the modulating fan clutch. 740598. Diesel Truck Fan Clutches to Meet the Energy and Environmental Challenges. Jim Hanks, Hor- ton Manufacturing Co., Inc.; Charles Selby and Philip Loken, Horton Industries, Inc. This paper discusses bearing arrangements designed to maximize stability and load capacity within available envelope dimensions. Also presented is a means of negating the detrimental effects of cylinder reactions in a pneumatic clutch, while at the same time increasing the torque-to-space ratio. These concepts were realized during a study expressly intended to view the various design elements with the requirements of a diesel truck fan clutch in mind. Further, the study resulted in the development of a nonmodulating, direct acting thermal control valve, specifically engineered to complement the action of a pneumatic fan clutch as part of an overall temperature controlling system. 740599. Energy and Synthetic Fuels for Transportation: A Summary. R. T. Johnson, University of Missouri - Rolla. In light of the probable shortage of liquid petroleum fuels in the United States for the foreseeable future, much attention is being focused on possible fuels as substitutes for conventional gasolines and distillate-type fuels. This paper surveys the presently available synthetic or substi- tute fuels being considered for transportation uses. The survey includes a brief review of current energy use patterns in the transportation sector and a projected future for the automobile and other transportation modes. Specialized fuel needs for the transportation sector are described including attributes of the ideal fuel. Discussion of possible synthetic fuel candidates is broken down into categories - hydrocarbons, hydrogen, inorganic hydrogen compounds, and electrochemical systems - and general properties. The properties of an idealized synthetic fuel are formulated and correlated with the properties of the ideal transportation fuel, and an extensive comparison of the selected synthetic fuel candidates is made. A significant portion of this com- parative information is presented in graphical and tabular form with appropriate discussion of the data and its presentation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the appli- cation potentials of the various synthetic fuel candidates to various modes. Interim and long-term fuel possibilities are proposed for further consideration. 740600. On-Board Hydrogen Generator for a Partial Hydrogen Injection Internal Combustion Engine. John Houseman and D. J. Cerini, California Institute of Technology. A compact onboard hydrogen generator has been de- veloped for use with a hydrogen-enriched gasoline internal combustion engine. The unit uses gasoline and air in a partial oxidation reactor to produce a gaseous product containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, minor 123</page><page sequence="83">740600-740608 amounts of methane, carbon dioxide and water, and nitrogen. A study of the theoretical equilibrium product composition has indicated an optimum operating point at an air/fuel ratio of 5.15, where a hydrogen/fuel mass ratio of 0.136 can be obtained under soot-free conditions. This is based on a gasoline with an atomic hydrogen to carbon ratio of 1.92. Both thermal and catalytic reactors have been tested. The thermal unit requires a reaction temperature of 2400° F to obtain 80% of the theoretical hydrogen yield. Soot formation tends to be a problem. The catalytic reactor yields close to theoretical yields at an operating temperature of 1800° F without any soot formation. A commercial nickel catalyst is used. A 100 h test with the catalytic unit showed no signs of performance degra- dation, using fully leaded Indolene 30. The calculated effect of hydrogen generator operating conditions on the fuel efficiency of a generator/engine combination is presented. 740602. Disc Brakes Take on the Heavies. W. T. Birge and K. H. Rinker, Kelsey-Hayes Co. Disc brakes for trucks have been the subject of intensive investigation in the United States since their adoption on passenger cars and light trucks in the mid 1960s. Although the basic industry work has covered the full range of medium and heavy hydraulic and air-braked trucks, the first commercial use of heavy-duty calipers will be on the front axles of heavy air-braked trucks where their stability and high torque characteristics are of particular advantage in meeting FMVSS 121, scheduled as of this writing to become effective March 1, 1975. 740603. Heavy Truck Disc Brakes - Testing for Tough- ness. S. L. Stokes, Wagner Electric Corp. This paper outlines various laboratory tests which can be utilized to evaluate heavy truck disc brakes. The methods described include supplemental techniques derived from improved dynamometer procedures which assure that the brake components and assembly will perform the in- tended function and that a practical and effective design has been obtained. They ensure that the brakes will provide the "toughness" required in the "real world" environment. 740604. Design Approaches to Truck Disc Brakes. Frank- lin B. Airheart, Hurst/ Airheart Products, Inc. Various approaches to truck disc brake design are discussed. Design of the disc and the effect of its design on brake performance show current designs being proposed may be inadequate. Lining area must be adequate for long life without restricting cooling. Piston retraction and adjustment by mechanical means is more reliable than seal retraction. A multiple disc oil-cooled hydraulic disc brake can provide extended life and high torque in a small diameter package. Air-actuated disc brakes eliminate the need for hydraulics, but introduce problems in force multiplication and brake-to-brake balance. 740605. Research and Development of the Honda CVCC Engine. Tasuku Date and Shizuo Yagi, Honda Research and Development Co., Ltd. This paper summarizes some of the technical considerations upon which Honda's CVCC system is based, relating to re- duction of pollutants in automobile engine exhaust gases. The CVCC engine employs a stratified charge to produce stable combustion of an overall lean mixture. A unique mixture is formed immediately before ignition to reduce three pollutants (CO, HC, and NO/dx) simultaneously, as well as to improve fuel economy. This mixture is produced by controlling fuel mixtures supplied to the engine and by geometrical combustion chamber design features. An evaluation model conceived by Honda to evaluate emissions and fuel economy during the driving cycle mode is explained, and a comparison of estimated values obtained from the evaluation model with those obtained under actual driving test conditions is made. 740606. Regulatory Implications of Truck Tire Noise Studies. William H. Close, Office of Noise Abatement, U.S. Department of Transportation. Based on the past research of the U.S. Department of Transportation, this paper is an attempt to make the case for tire noise regulation and to illustrate the implications of such regulations to tire users. The paper examines the effects of speed, load, tire tread type, road surface, and placement of tires on combination truck vehicles insofar as passby sound levels are concerned. A concluding table of expected roadside sound levels based upon typical tire use indicates the potential restrictions in tire types that are inherent in presently proposed federal noise regulations on interstate motor carriers. It is concluded that as significant technological improvements are implemented in the design and regulation of truck engine noise, more severe tire user requirements will follow in order that tire noise keep pace with declining engine noise. 740607. Effect of Road Surface and Bed Clearance on Truck Tire Noise. G. R. Thurman, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The sound level of crossbar-type tires was found to be only slightly affected by the texture of the portland concrete road surfaces used. Rib-type tires showed higher noise levels on coarse than on smooth surfaces, but the ranking of different tires was unaffected. Clearance of the truck bed above the tire was relatively unimportant. Noise level increased with increase in speed. Sound persistence after truck passby is related to tread design and possibly to the radiation pattern from the road-tire interface. 740608. Spectral Analysis in Truck Tire Noise Fields. R. F. Miller and D. B. Thrasher, B. F. Goodrich Co. This paper discusses the importance of the spectral distribution of the energy in the sound to the dB(A) level of the usual passby test. A described technique obtains reproducible "real-time" spectra from the nonstationary sound field. Doppler effect and source frequency shift are 124</page><page sequence="84">740608-740619 quantified in relating these spectra to the tread pattern repetitions. Inverse square law fitting is viewed through the two-source-microphone relation which changes during the spectral window period. Spectra are shown for 6, 12, and 50 ft (1.83, 3.66, and 15.2 m) passby microphones and for a microphone carried on the truck. Discussion: P. R. Willett, The Olympic Tyre and Rubber Co. PTY. Ltd. 1974 SA E Transactions 740609. Truck Tire Vibration Noise. William F. Reiter, Jr. and Allen C. Eberhardt, Center for Acous- tical Studies, North Carolina State University. This paper describes the procedure and instrumentation used to telemeter, record, and analyze in-service truck tire accelerations. The tire sound signal monitored at a point approximately 1 ft to the rear of the tire was recorded simultaneously with the acceleration signal on board the test vehicle. Subsequent time domain, frequency domain, and level analyses of the signals show the importance and relationship of tire acceleration to the tire noise generated. The results reported are for a 10:00-20 cross-bar type tire with three states of wear, two load conditions, and three speeds. 1974 SA E Transactions 740614. Rear-End Collisions Reduced: A Large-Scale Experiment under Natural Conditions. John Voevodsky, Voevodsky Associates, Inc. A deceleration warning light system installed on taxicabs in San Francisco for 12.3 million miles of normal on-road driving reduced the rear-end collision rate by 60.6% compared to the rate for a concurrent control group of cabs which traveled 7.2 million miles. Comparing the experimental group with the concurrent control group revealed that the warning light prevented 5.4 collisions per million miles, 1.02 cab driver injuries per million miles, and $643 of taxicab damage per million miles. An amber light was center mounted on the rear of several hundred taxicabs and was designed to communicate information about the taxi's deceleration to following drivers. 1974 SA E Transactions 740615. Some Effects of Road, Truck and Headlamp Characteristics on Visibility and Glare in Night Driving. Rudolf G. Mortimer, Highway Safety Res. Inst., University of Michigan. Differences in characteristics between automobiles and trucks, such as driver eye height and headlamp mounting height, were examined, as well as roadway vertical and horizontal curvature and meeting beam patterns and lamp aim. Effects of these variables were evaluated by a computer simulation of nighttime meetings on a 2-lane road. The visibility distance and direct and indirect (mirror) glare discomfort effects were measured. Results suggest that: low beam headlamps on trucks should not be mounted at more than about 36 in (0.91 m) from ground level, the increase in visibility provided by the mid beam is less for truck drivers than those of automobiles, the mid beam is less affected by vertical aim variations than the low beam, the mid beam should be extinguished by the vehicle in the inside lane on curves when meeting other vehicles and when following another vehicle at less than about 200 ft (61 m). 1974 SA E Transactions 740616. Future Considerations in Automotive Lighting Design. Rex W. Oyler, Guide Lamp Div., General Motors Corp. This paper covers automotive lighting devices and allied equipment as they might be used in front, side, and rear lighting. Consideration is given to legal aspects, stan- dardization opportunities, hardware involved, and criteria for final decision making. Comparisons of relative headlight seeing distances have been made, and sugges- tions for an intermediate or mid-beam configuration are proposed. The three-beam approach appears to offer the greatest immediate potential for headlighting improve- ment. 740617. Interchangeability of Automotive Headlamps - Rectangular? Roger H. Hemion, Southwest Research Institute. The feasibility of approving the use of a rectangular shaped, sealed-beam headlamp as an alternative to round headlamps is discussed in terms of economics, service and maintainability, vehicle design, and styling. A conclusion of primary interest is reached, that design as well as performance standardization is in the interest of the buying public, under certain conditions, and proliferation of designs without compensatory gain should be avoided. 740618. The Truck Automatic and Vehicle Economics. J. F. Hittle and A. R. Schuette, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Because of the increasing complexity of commercial trucking operation and management, the truck automatic transmission is being found to be an asset in terms of overall vehicle economics - in addition to its long rec- ognized features of ease of operation and safety. A number of salient vehicle cost factors upon which the truck automatic transmission has an impact are discussed - along with the transmission design principles which lead to that impact. Acceptance of this premise by the trucking industry is shown by market segment. In addition to discussing the contribution of the truck automatic trans- mission toward improving the overall economics position of today's commercial vehicles, this paper gives indication of forthcoming refinements in transmission design which will further reduce fuel consumption costs. 740619. Why Not Triples? T. D. Hutton, Freightliner Corp. The size and weight of commercial motor vehicles have been effectively frozen since the adoption of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. The removal of political 125</page><page sequence="85">740619-740627 barriers for the liberalization of these restrictions will help stem the tide of inflation, while at the same time making potential fuel savings of as much as 21% for intercity freight trucks a reality. With transportation a recurrent cost in every phase of production, distribution, and service, fuel becoming more expensive, and the security of supply more tenuous, the significant increase in trans- portation efficiency provided by from the nation's economy. Millions of operational miles have clearly demonstrated that our nation's highways have been built to the point where they can safely handle this equipment, with triples having established the best safety record of any vehicle ever used on our highways. Triples also make it possible to move freight with fewer vehicles, thereby reducing highway congestion, conserving energy, and consequently reducing pollution. 740620. Nine Ways to Get Better Fuel Mileage. D. L. Berry, Shell Oil Co. The widespread problems of gasoline availability have caused motorists to take new interest in the fuel economy of their cars and in gasoline conservation methods. As a means of illustrating a variety of effective fuel saving techniques, reference is made to the performance of four cars that have achieved outstanding fuel mileage (150-376 miles/gal) during competition in Shell Mileage Marathon contests. Suggestions are offered for ways in which the average driver can improve fuel economy in current-type automobiles. The importance of proper vehicle main- tenance is also stressed. 740622. Mack's New Intercooled Six Cylinder Diesel, Maxidyne 300. G. W. Robbins and C. K. Salter, Mack Trucks, Inc. The application of an advanced state-of-the-art inlet system has produced a high specific output, high torque rise, heavy-duty diesel truck engine. By integrating a compact plate-fin air-to-air heat exchanger with the cooling air driven by a novel tip turbine fan, a 25% increase in power output has been achieved with minimal increase in mechanical engine loads. The use of an aluminum two-piece piston which prevents side thrust loading on the ring-carrying head section results in improved ring life and reduced oil consumption. 740623. The Role of Personal Rapid Transit in Mass Transit. T. A. Lancaster and D. L. Hearn, Rohr Industries, Inc. With the nation looking more and more to mass transit to solve its urban transportation problems, the innovative Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) systems with their "second car" characteristics can be expected to complement bus and rail services, especially in medium-density population areas. After summarizing the role each of these three forms of public transit plays and is projected to play by 1990, the paper describes current specialized PRT appli- cations in the United States and abroad. 740625. A Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) System for Las Vegas, Nevada. W. J. Holt and R. W. Corey, Monocab, Inc. Las Vegas, Nevada, is one of the ideal urban environ- ments for a Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) System. The city operates on a "round the clock" basis and highway traffic congestion is becoming severe with the growth of tourism. The principal industry is tourism and a fare structure can be imposed which will make a PRT system self-supporting. A PRT system is described which meets the antici- pated Las Vegas requirements of 24 h/day operation, vehicle and service being designed to compete favorably with the automobile. The PRT system elements described include vehicle, guideway, control features, stations, and maintenance facility. The results of a maintenance plan analysis and financial considerations are also discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740626. Design Considerations for Motorcycle Exhaust Systems. Larry J. Eriksson, Nelson Industries, Inc. In addition to adequate sound and performance levels, practical exhaust systems are characterized by a large number of design considerations. These include size, weight, position, cost, durability, styling, and tonal quality. This paper discusses the severe constraints that motorcycles place on these parameters because of their relatively small size and high performance levels. 740627. Motorcycle Emissions, Their Impact, and Pos- sible Control Techniques. Charles T. Hare and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and William Rogers Oliver, William H. Hout- man and Thomas A. Hüls, Environmental Protection Agency. Seven motorcycles, ranging in size from 100 to 1200 cm3, were tested for emissions characterization purposes. They were operated on the federal seven-mode test procedure (for 1971 and older light-duty vehicles), the federal LA-4 test procedure (for 1972 and later LDVs), and under a variety of steady-state conditions. Four of the machines tested had 4-stroke engines, and the other three had 2-stroke engines. Emissions which were measured included hydrocar- bons, CO, C02, NO, NOx, 02, aldehydes, light hydro- carbons, particulates, and smoke. Emissions of SOx were estimated on the basis of fuel consumed, and evaporative hydrocarbon losses were also estimated. Crankcase "blow- by" emissions from one 4-stroke machine were measured. The impact of motorcycles on national pollutant totals was estimated, based on the test results and information from a variety of sources on national population and usage of motorcycles. In addition, a brief overview of emisson control technology which might be applicable to motorcycles is presented. This discussion indicates that control of hydrocarbon emissions from 2-stroke machines and CO emissions from large motorcycles of both 2-stroke 126</page><page sequence="86">740627-740646 and 4-stroke types are immediate priorities for meeting the tentative 1976 EPA motorcycle emission standards. 1974 SA E Transactions 740628. A Study of Motorcycle Suspension Damping Characteristics. Gordon Jennings, Cycle Maga- zine. Reports from the field offer widespread agreement that certain of the currently produced motorcycle forks and shock absorbers give superior results in terms of ride and handling. This study was undertaken to establish such correlation as may exist between the qualitative differ- ences noted by experienced motorcycle riders and com- parative suspension damping characteristics as revealed by instrumented bench testing. Substantial and significant variations were discovered in the course of these bench tests, not only in general damping patterns, but also in response to temperature increases typically encountered during dynamic testing. This paper describes methods and hardware employed, interprets results, and suggests future lines of development. 740630. Antilock Brake System Application to a Motor- cycle Front Wheel. Raymond J. Miennert, Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Inc. Antilock brake systems suitable for use on a motorcycle were investigated under an experimental safety motor- cycle program. Due to program constraints, the only systems inves- tigated were those already perfected by brake system manufacturers. This enabled utilization of the latest state-of-the-art principles to accomplish the desired result in the shortest time. Various types of systems and power sources were investigated. The system chosen for the motorcycle application was a fluid powered system in conjunction with a production hydraulic disc brake. Laboratory and field tests have been conducted with results exceeding expectations. 740641. Product Liability - Let the Seller's Engineers Beware. W. A. Gebhardt, 1974 SAE President. Product liability is a growing concern to both industry and engineers. The number of cases involving product liability is growing rapidly, as is the amount of awarded damages. The history of this field of civil law is examined, as are its present-day ramifications and the courts' widely ex- panding view of manufacturer liability. Also examined are the steps to be taken to reduce risk of litigation - through proper design and construction and prudence in advertising. 740642. The Role of Methanol as a Clean Fuel. Robert G. Jackson, Continental Oil Co. The use of coal as a prime energy source is examined. The author focuses on the process of coal gasification to produce a synthesis gas for subsequent conversion to either gaseous or liquid products, and particularly on the methanol process. The production of methanol is de- scribed, as are ways of using it commercially. 740643. Designing to a Reliability Specification. Charles Mischke, Engineering Research Institute, Iowa State University. This paper advocates designing to reliability specifica- tions. In this context, the author discusses design criterion, random-variable algebra, closure, loading as a random process, geometry as a random variate, materials behav- ior, and load-induced stress as a random variate. Math- ematical equations are presented, as are computational examples. 740644. INTRAC System 2000 - Vehicle Technique, De- velopment Methods, System Farm, and Industrial Applications. Bert Breuer, Klöckner-Humboldt- Deutz AG (West Germany). This paper deals with the development of system- vehicles-characterized by front-mounted safety cabins, front and rear hydraulic three-point hitches with auto- matic couplings for implements, and centrally mounted tanks or containers-for farm and industry. Technical configuration of a range of four vehicles with an engine output form 37,5 kW-DIN (51 hp-DIN) to 174 kW-DIN (236 hp-DIN) is explained. Particular attention is paid to problems concerning an automatic hydrostatic transmission. Farm and industrial applica- tions of these vehicles are illustrated. 740645. White Farm Equipments 4-150 Field Boss. Mark H. Sickman and Garry O. Bowhall, White Farm Equipment Co. A new, articulated, 4-wheel drive agricultural tractor has been developed which combines the advantages of 2-wheel drive tractors with the advantages of full-time, 4-wheel drive tractors with equal-size wheels. To accom- plish this, the tractor incorporates a unique drivetrain and frame arrangement. An unusual cab-mounting arrange- ment is also used that reduces the chance of serious injury in the event of a rollover. 740646. Application of Ergonomics in the Design of Agricultural Prime Movers. Torbjörn Knutsson and Bruce A. Hertig, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois. This study was undertaken to determine the nature and extent of the formal and informal programs in ergonomics currently utilized in the industry. From these findings a theoretical schema is proposed to better apply the techniques of ergonomics in a systematic way. A more systematic approach to attention to the human factors in equipment design may provide, among other benefits, reduction in equipment-related accidents, product liability claims, and improvement in operator safety and effi- ciency. The schema may also suggest to the academic community areas where curricula might be modified to meet the changing educational needs of the agricultural 127</page><page sequence="87">740646-740659 industry. 740647. Evaluating Crop Production Systems by Energy Used. S. J. Clark and W. H. Johnson, Kansas State University. Current energy supplies are finite and are being used at an ever increasing rate. We can no longer evaluate alter- natives on a cost basis alone. Crop production systems are no exception. We must now evaluate such systems on energy-use and environmental impact bases as well as on a cost basis. This study was to develop and compare energy budgets for wheat, grain sorghum, and wheat-grain sorghum rotation tillage systems. Energy inputs consid- ered included machinery and parts manufacturing, crop production fuel, and tire and herbicide manufacturing. Our results show that energy requirements for crop production tillage systems vary considerably. Fuel con- sumed by tractors in performing the tillage operations was the largest input (39.6-82.5% of the total). Energy for herbicide, however, was almost as large as the fuel input for the grain sorghum no-till system. No-till systems use slightly more energy than till-plant tillage systems for grain sorghum (60.8 versus 54.5% of conventional). Wheat conservation tillage systems use less energy than do conventional tillage systems that include moldboard plowing (82.9% of conventional). One broadcast appli- cation of atrazine reduced the tillage energy for a wheat-grain-sorghum rotation system 16.7%. 740655. Oil-Friction Material Interaction and the Effects of Conditions of Use. Robert L. Fish, Friction Material Div., Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. The literature provides considerable evidence confirming interaction of oil and friction material on performance characteristics obtained in a wet friction unit. Both elements can be modified to meet a wide range of requirements. Furthermore, it is well established that the performance obtained with any specific oil-material combination can be modified with usage. In this report, additional evidence of interaction is offered from test of five friction materials and five oil types. How the interactions are affected by conditions of use is also explored. Data on variable energy loading, power loading, oil sump temperature, oil flow, and sump volume factors are included, not only as a design guide on methods of eliminating or minimizing performance fluctuations re- sulting from such interactions, but also to demonstrate the kind of variable that can produce the chemical and/or physical change of sufficient magnitude to modify results. Also demonstrated is the fact that the effects of such conditions of use are not necessarily consistent and that trends produced by a variable may be different for each oil-friction material system. It is implied that further study of such variables is required to permit scientific selection of the optimum combination for any specific design. 740656. A Review of Farm Tractor Transmission Fluids. Leonard C. Shrewsbury, The Lubrizol Corp. New "multifunction" farm tractor transmission, hydrau- lic, and wet brake fluids are being introduced to the tractor industry. The background of tractor lubrication and hydraulic component development that created a need for these fluids is discussed. Fluid friction characteristics tailored to wet brake, power takeoff (PTO), and transmission clutch perform- ance along with improved antiwear and EP protection for gears are taking on more importance with the continued increase in tractor horsepower. At the same time, a long-sought goal of simplifying the number of lubricants required by the tractor industry is being realized through the use of these new fluids. 740657. Maintenance of Hydraulic Components on Army Construction Equipment. William P. Coyne, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and De- velopment Center. This paper presents the current status of the Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center's new Hydraulic System Test and Repair Unit (HSTRU). In addition to describing the configuration of the prototype, it discusses the military requirements which led to its development and the analysis of the engineering tradeoffs involved in the selection of its components. Throughout the paper, analogies are drawn between military and commercial needs for the repair and maintenance of hydraulic systems in fielded mobile construction equip- ment. 740658. Oil Analysis Applications to Off -Highway Equip- ment. Jack Poley, Analysts, Inc. This paper describes how a comprehensive oil analysis program is implemented in operations involving off- highway and similar equipment. Oil samples are taken on a routine basis and thoroughly analyzed in a laboratory. Tests are tailored to the equipment being sampled, and individual records are maintained per unit to allow monitoring of trends. Highly qualified data analysts review test results and provide practical maintenance recommendations. The result is an improvement in reliability, reduced downtime, and the direction of repair efforts only when and where necessary. Test significance and interpretation are discussed and exemplary case histories provided. 740659. Reliability of Construction Equipment Vehicles. John Czarnecki, Construction Equipment Div., International Harvester Co. Customer demands for reliability in construction equip- ment are increasing. Reliability results first from adequate design and second from the capability of manufacturing in executing this design. The ultimate measure of relia- bility is performance for the customer. Information concerning good or bad performance must be commu- nicated and used to improve new designs and correct existing machines. This can be accomplished effectively 128</page><page sequence="88">740659-740668 with the use of a reliability organization, operating independently of the line organization and with final approval of all products shipped. 740660. Meeting Trailer Brake Requirements of French Law. Carl E. Kittle, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works; and Hans J. Hille, John Deere Works, Mannheim. Inadequate braking systems on large tractor-trailer com- binations are a general problem, and in France they have given rise to a law governing trailer brakes. This paper describes how hydraulically powered braking systems were designed for trailers and tractor-trailers to meet the new requirements. 740661. Brake Test Procedures and Brake Performance Criteria for Agricultural Equipment. John E. Langdon, J. I. Case Co. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the background, contents, and recommended criteria of SAE Recom- mended Practice J 1041 - Brake Test Procedures and Brake Performance Criteria for Agricultural Equipment. The test procedure and performance criteria are directed toward the safe travel, towing, and parking of agricultural equipment on the highway. 1974 SAE Transactions 740663. An Introduction to Electric Trailer Brake Sys- tems. David L. Swanson, Warner Electric Brake &amp; Clutch Co. The electric wheel brake utilizes the principle of controlled electric current to an electromagnetic actuator to provide input into the brake shoes. A description of the function of the electric brake magnet and controller operation is provided, as is an account of the application of the safety breakaway switch and variable resistor or load control in assembling a complete electric brake system. 740664. 200hp Class Tractor from Concept to Contractor. Ronald J. Fanslow, International Harvester Co. This paper describes the design concept and character- istics created to develop a new 200 hp class crawler tractor and the subsequent test to assume the achievement of objectives. The new tractor provides a stable platform for good control of the dozer blade and ripper, a main frame for independent mounting of the hydraulically controlled power train and superstructure components, easy serv- icing of power train components, integration of the ROPS with the chassis, and a 210 hp engine at 2100 rpm. 740665. Design and Development of a Modular Power Train for a New 210 hp Crawler Tractor. John Joachim Horsch, International Harvester Co. The advantages of a modular power train arrangement for a crawler tractor and the specific design requirements for each power train component are presented here. The paper indicates how these established objectives were met by design and development. Some test results are provided, showing that a good correlation between design and actual performance has been achieved. A model for calculating clutch energies has been developed. 740666. The First 31/2 Miles to the Moon. David Cook, Electronic Fuel Injection Div., The Bendix Corp. The long journeys of the Saturn rockets from the launch pad into the environment of space have been thoroughly documented on film and in written words during the historic era of the United States space programs. The countless miles logged by the space vehicles after lift-off have been witnessed by millions of armchair astronauts around the globe through the media of television and journalism. Little is known, however, about the first 3]/2 miles that the assembled rockets travel, and the tech- nology required to traverse that short distance. 740667. Rationalization of Lubricants for Agricultural Tractors. I. Keddie, W. A. Munday and E. L. Padmore, Shell Research Ltd. This paper describes the sequential development of both multipurpose and universal oils for agricultural tractors. "Universal oil" infers the concept of one oil to lubricate the tractor including engine, drivelines, oil-immersed brakes if fitted, and farm equipment whereas a "multi- purpose oil" lubricates drivelines, brakes, and equipment but not the engine. Such rationalization is desirable both to the user and to the oil supplier. Moreover, it has proved technically feasible to meet the requirements of most major manufacturers' tractors in service. Successful rationalization depends upon careful selec- tion of additives and comprehensive testing in rigs and tractors. Multipurpose formulations must have specific frictional characteristics for lubricating both immersed disc brakes and immersed power takeoff clutches and load-carrying and antiwear properties for gearing, pumps, and bearings, etc. Equally important are oxidation- corrosion stability, seal performance, rheology, and other related chemical and physical properties. The universal oil must provide for all the preceding driveline require- ments and in addition lubricate the engine. The problems arising from such developments and the ways in which the difficulties have been overcome are explained. 740668. A New European Supercharged Test Engine for the Evaluation of Diesel Lubricants. F. Roux, Institut Francais du Petrole (France); and E. G. Thomas, Edwin Cooper &amp; Co., Ltd. (United Kingdom). This paper outlines the development of a lubricating oil test for high-performance diesel engines, especially those of European manufacture. The tentative method, CEC L-13-T-74, was developed with the cooperation of the Co-Ordinating European Council. The lubrication re- quirements of European diesel engines is outlined, along with the steps in the test procedure which cover these 129</page><page sequence="89">740668-740678 requirements. Comparisons are made with the Caterpillar test methods. 1974 SAE Transactions 740669. Super Tractor Oil Universal For the European Market. R. N. Smith, Lubrizol International Laboratories, Hazelwood, England. For many years European farmers have used Tractor Oils Universal (TOU) - suitable for use in both engine and power train. Generally, these lubricants have been MIL-L-2104B engine oils containing sufficient additional zinc dithiophosphate to satisfy the mild extreme-pressure requirement of the power train. However, when such lubricants were used in the oil-immersed brakes intro- duced on tractors in recent times, experience showed that they were incapable of preventing 'squawk'. A 'new generation' of universal tractor lubricants has been developed to overcome this problem. As well as providing acceptable anti-squawk performance in wet brakes, these lubricants - known as Super Tractor Oil Universal (STOU) - give improved performance in nat- urally aspirated and turbocharged diesel engines and in gasoline engines, and are suitable for use in fluid- immersed power take-off units. The history of universal lubricants is briefly reviewed, and the deficiencies of early STOU fluids are noted. The development of STOU additives for the latest STOU fluids is described with reference to tests in full-scale tractor equipment and in acknowledged test engines. The effect of changing the base stocks is mentioned, and the advantages of the new products are discussed in terms of performance in engines to the standards of the MIL- L-2104C and MIL-L-46152 specifications, and in trans- missions and wet brakes to levels that satisfy the majority of tractor manufacturers' requirements. 740670. Driveline Splines and Axial Motion Mechanisms. E. R. Wagner, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., General Motors Corp. This paper presents a discussion of various types of splines and axial motion mechanisms suitable for typical highway and off-highway vehicles. The description, function, design, manufacturing, material selection, and surface treatments as well as lubrication and sealing of these devices are discussed in varying detail. 740671. Double Cardan Constant Velocity Universal Joint. Charles E. Cooney, Jr., Borg-Warner Corp. The double Cardan joint is a solution for many driveline design configurations where the speed and included continuous operating universal joint angle requirements make it impossible to use a single Cardan joint. The basic design principals, dynamic operating char- acteristics, and the application of the double Cardan constant velocity universal joint are presented as a guide to the application of the double Cardan-type universal joint. Vehicle concepts are made possible with the preferred or most convenient location of components by using a double Cardan design. It offers an economical solution to driveline configurations that must operate at unequal compound angles. 1974 SAE Transactions 740673. 18000 Series Power Shift Transmission Devel- opment. Ronald Sisson, Clark Equipment Co. This paper describes the concept, design, and options of a new power shift transmission family for industrial equip- ment in the 50-100 hp range. The converter, clutch, and gearing arrangements provide the basis for various transmission configurations with both a drop and straight through output. The designs allow multiple usage of components within a transmission and between different sizes of transmissions. The various gearing, bearing, and clutch designs are based on proved experience factors, and as such will provide a new reliable family of transmissions. 740674. Design and Development of the Funk 4000 Power Shift Transmission. John M. Beeson and Jim R. Wiebe, Funk Manufacturing Co. Funk Manufacturing has designed and developed a 60-100 hp power shift transmission to meet the needs of industry. Construction details of the 4000 power shift are reviewed. This design produces the most compact ar- rangement with the fewest parts for minimum cost. Unique clutch arrangements and control valve designs are described in this paper. A comparison of the 2- and 3-speed versions is detailed, as well as the interchange- ability of parts for both speeds. Optional features of the transmission are also noted. 740676. Parameters Contributing to Power Loss in Dis- engaged Wet Clutches. Frederick A. Lloyd, Friction Material Div., Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. A two-level full-factorial experiment was designed to determine how seven parameters contribute to the power loss in disengaged wet clutches. The results of this program indicate which parameters and interactions of parameters are significant. The important trends were then further evaluated by individual tests, in order to allow extrapolation of these results beyond the two levels assigned in the designed experiment. 1974 SAE Transactions 740677. Snowmobile Ski Suspensions. Harold E. Holl- nagel, Mechanical Industries Inc. The increasing popularity of snowmobiles and the need for snowmobiling safety will require more sophisticated snowmobile suspensions. A history of the suspension development, a definition of the engineering problems, and an understanding of the latest designs provide an excellent background for further research. 740678. Shock Absorbers: An Integral Part of Recre- 130</page><page sequence="90">ational Vehicle Developments. Richard C. Cline, Maremont Corp. Various applications of the familiar tubular hydraulic shock absorber to recreational vehicles are reviewed. There is a brief discussion of operating characteristics of hydraulic shock absorbers as a preliminary to discussing damping requirements for suspensions, steering dampers, sway controllers, and stabilizers found on recreational vehicles. The review covers present use of shock absorbers on motorcycles, snowmobiles, golf carts, boat trailers, trailer brakes, outboard motors, travel trailers, sway control motor homes, and camper stabilizers. For some of these, possibilities for future developments are indicated. 740679. The ABC's of Radial Off-The-Road Earthmover Tires. H. R. Vermie, The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. The advantages and disadvantages of radial off-the-road earthmover tires are discussed with comparisons to the bias ply tire.

Reducing the "Skid" in Log Skidders. E. K. Henry, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The development of a line of tires designed specifically for log skidder application is described in this paper. Extreme operating conditions led to the abandonment of regular agricultural drive tires for this application. Direct per- formance comparisons of the new lines of log skidder tires with standard agricultural drive tires are presented. 740683. The National Energy Problem - Demand and Conservation Outlook. C. A. Phalen. Studies have been made which indicate that the unconstrained daily energy demand in the United States will approximately double between 1970 and 1990, from 32 million bbl crude oil equivalent (COE) to 67 million bbl COE. These same studies suggest, however, that a savings of as much as 8.6 million bbl COE might be achieved by 1990 if a maximum conservation effort were to be made in the more critical consumption areas. These include the utility, transportation, industrial, commer- cial, and residential markets. 740684. Waste Oil: A Resource to be Conserved. Melvin H. Chiogioji, Federal Energy Administration. This paper focuses on waste automotive and industrial oil as a prospective candidate for greater recycling and reclamation. Although lubricating oils represent only 1% of the total domestic petroleum production, conservation can result in significant gains. For example, to produce this oil from new crude reserves would take an investment 740678-740689 of perhaps $80 million in refinery capacity and an exploration, development, and production investment exceeding $3 billion. The present primary end uses of waste oil and the techniques required to reclaim waste oil are described. The major impediments to greater waste oil usage are analyzed including the following factors: economics, technology, waste oil collection, government actions, and environment quality problems. Federal policy proposals are presented to encourage more widespread reclamation of waste oil. 1974 SA E Transactions 740685. Vehicle and Machine Operator Sound Data Acquisition and Reduction System. Walker H. Flint, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The unaltered, commercially available instrumentation described in this paper provides an accurate (close to type 1 sound level meter tolerances) and lightweight (total system-5.25 lb) sound recording system. In conjunction with commercially available programable calculators, this instrumentation enables accurate determination of dosage to various criteria.

Motorcycle Noise Test Procedure Evaluation: SAE XJ331a and XJ47. Ross A. Little, Cali- fornia Highway Patrol. SAE Recommended Practice XJ331a, Sound Levels for Motorcycles, was developed to represent vehicle operation and is well suited for determining noise levels of new motorcycles offered for sale. Similar procedures have been used for this purpose since 1969. SAE Recommended Practice XJ47, Maximum Sound Level Potential for Motorcycles, was developed as a manufacturing tool to determine a vehicle's maximum sound level potential and is an excellent tool for manufacturers. Because of its severe operating requirements, SAE XJ47 is not suited or recommended to be used as an enforcement standard. 1974 SAE Transactions 740687. Off-Road Vehicle Noise - Effects on Operators and Bystanders. Robin T. Harrison, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Noise from motorcycles, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and dune buggies is seen as causing problems-both according to the setting of the off-road vehicle and with reference to health (auditory and nonauditory) effects. Results of testing these vehicles and the noise they cause are presented, why this noise should be a concern and what to do about it are also discussed. 1974 SAE Transactions 740689. Cooling System Analysis. James A. Mosier and F. Nelson Jarrett, Modine Mfg. Co. Cooling systems for agricultural and construction equip- 131</page><page sequence="91">740689-740695 ment evolved from engine cooling only to those requiring oil cooling, charge air aftercooling, and control of cab environment. Cooling air flow analysis using computer design techniques eases the design of these multi- component systems. With consistent rating methods for comparison of options and correlation of calculated results to vehicle tests, the analysis system adapts to most vehicle types. 740690. Combination Heat Exchangers for Industrial and Agricultural Vehicles. W. Melnyk, McCord Corp., Heat Transfer Div. Analysis of vehicle systems performance data of a radiator, air-cooled oil cooler, and air-conditioning condenser is presented. The effects of adding individual heat exchangers ahead of the radiator are reviewed with emphasis on uneven air velocities and entering air temperature changes over the heat exchangers. The improvements of combining two heat exchangers into one unit are presented, along with the effect on the total system. The paper also discusses improvements in manufac- turing relating to reduction in cost of the combination unit, as well as the concept of combining an air- conditioning evaporator and cab heater. 740691. Designing the Engine Cooling Fan. Bernard R. Barański, Wallace Murray Corp. Designing fans for engine cooling systems requires an .understanding of the wind tunnel performance test, its limitations, and its correlation with installation per- formance. Dimensionless correlations of fan geometry and performance data provide a tool for a rational selection of the fan geometry. Materials and construction are predicted on durability considerations. 1974 SA E Transactions 740692. Effect of Diesel Fuel Properties on Emissions and Performance. L. C. Broering, Cummins Engine Co.; and L. W. Holtman, Shell Oil Co. Tests were conducted with several production diesel engines and one prototype low-emission diesel engine to determine the effect of fuel properties on exhaust emissions and engine performance. Fuel cetane number was found to be the most significant fuel property; low cetane fuels resulted in higher hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen and increased noise. Conversely, higher cetane fuels produced lower emis- sions and noise, and also improved engine starting characteristics. The degree of these effects was influenced by engine configuration. Although engine design changes can result in sub- stantial emissions reduction, fuel properties can also influence achieveable levels. 1974 SA E Transactions 740693. Environmental Considerations and the Energy Crisis - the Effect on Gasoline Consumption. R. S. Spindt and R. E. Kline, Gulf Research and Development Co. The current shortage of gasoline and the existence of vehicle emisson standards have raised the question of what tomorrow's gasoline will be like. This paper reviews the environmental considerations and the energy supply situation, discusses the likely future processing schemes, and considers the gasoline properties expected in the future. In general, we believe the current processes will continue to be used and future gasolines will have properties similar to present fuels. More octane numbers will be obtained by processing than by the use of lead alkyls, which may result in more aromatics and less sulfur. 740694. Fuels and Emissions - Update and Outlook, 1974. R. W. Hurn and T. W. Chamberlain, Bureau Of Mines, U.S. Department Of Interior. Profound change has been observed in automotive emissions since the late 1960's. This change is marked both in the amount and in the chemical makeup of the controlled emissions. In general, the trend toward de- creased levels of the several categories of emissions is well known, but changes in the chemical character of the hydrocarbon component are less well recognized. The nature of these changes and implications for air pollution effects are discussed. As the absolute levels of emissions are reduced, small incremental changes become relatively more important. Such incremental changes are brought about by change in ambient temperature, and therefore the sensitivity of emission control systems to changes in ambient temper- ature takes on added significance. Data are presented to show that emissions control may deteriorate seriously at some temperatures at which vehicles normally operate. Will emissions considerations force change in fuel usage, and if so, how are emissions affected? The question is examined both from the viewpoint of a switch from gasoline to other conventional fuels and from the viewpoint that gasoline composition may change. More- over, with supplies of motor fuel from petroleum sources in long-term jeopardy, there is growing interest in the character of emissions to be expected in using alternative fuels. The more viable options for alternative fuels are identified, and emissions characteristics of these fuels are described. 740695. Recent Advances in Internal Combustion Engine Instrumentation with Particular Reference to High-Speed Data Acquisition and Automated Test Bed. R. S. Benson and R. Pick, The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (England). The development of instrumentation techniques for research in internal combustion engines is described. A general discussion of instrument classification and re- quirements is followed by a description of transducer development including calibration techniques, signal 132</page><page sequence="92">740695-740709 processing, and data acquisition. Details are given of two direct on-line digitizing devices for high-speed data acquisition, (one purpose made and the other using an on-line computer.) An analysis of instrumentation and data acquisition errors is presented. The integration of the data acquisition equipment into a semiautomatic con- trolled test bed is described and a proposal for a fully automated test bed presented. Appendices giving details of the basic principles of the operation and design considerations of the on-line computer facility for data acquisition and engine test bed control are included. 1974 SAE Transactions 740696. The Dependability of Automatic Engine Test Beds. P-S Berg, Truck Div., AB Volvo. In 1961 a new engine laboratory was built. The long-term beds were built with open-loop automatic control and output systems. In 1968 the function test beds were fitted with automatic reading, output, and diagram drawing systems. In 1970 the next generation of long-term test beds was built. This paper presents a brief description of the various systems. The main emphasis is on the units which have reduced dependability and the successful actions later taken to restore this dependability to an acceptable level. 740698. Cantilevered Boom Plate Edge Restraints. Howard I. Shapiro and Charles M. Shapiro, Consulting Engineers. In some box section cantilevered booms, the assumption of simply supported edges for the compression plate is too conservative. A method is provided here for readily determining, from section dimensions, when better edge restraint conditions are present. Equations are provided for calculating edge restraint factors and for increasing the effective compression plate width when appropriate. 740699. Destructive Test of Cantilever Plate Boom. Oliver P. Bonesteel, Bucyrus-Erie Co. The designer of a hydraulic box-type boom must attempt to meet the requirements of a capacity chart with load ratings that are as large as possible. To accomplish this, the boom structure must be made as light as possible. To check the validity of known calculation methods for the buckling of cantilevered plate booms, the second section of the boom was manufactured to 0.4184:1.0000 scale. This was done because the physical size of the boom section would have presented difficulty in destructive testing. The boom section was strain gaged by loading on a test stand in exactly the same way as an actual section under normal conditions. The section was tested to destruction. It was found that the failure was initiated in the bottom plate (near the lower pad) as a result of plate buckling in compression closely followed by failure of the vertical plates in buckling caused by the bending and shear force. This test verifies the use of the proposed SAE calculation method for plate booms and suggests some possible modifications to account for corner stiffeners. 1974 SAE Transactions 740704. Preliminary and Computer Plastic Analyses of Rollover Protective Structures. James Brown, WABCO; and John McNabb, Bradley Univer- sity. Two plastic analyses are presented for rollover protective structures: a preliminary two-dimensional analysis ena- bling the designer to meet recommended practice SAE J396, and a refined analysis adapting the problem- oriented language IBM-STRESS to treat the problem as a three-dimensional one. Full-scale experiments with six rollover protective structures for earthmoving machines confirm these anal- yses for prediction of load-deflection behavior and energy absorption. 1974 SAE Transactions 740706. Stress Analysis of Industrial Components with Plastic and Finite Element Models. J. N. Clark, D. F. Barnhart and W. F. Hayes, Massey- Ferguson, Inc. Plastic scale models and finite element modeling have been developed as useful tools for stress analysis of machine components. Preliminary experience has refined each method so that reliable results are now being obtained, as confirmed by the correlation of output from these separate approaches. 1974 SAE Transactions 740707. Industrial Vehicle Structural Development Using Plastic Simulette Stress Analysis. D. R. Hart- degen, International Harvester Co. Structural development time can be shortened with the use of plastic simulettes. This paper covers a sample of experimental structural development on an industrial vehicle using plastic simulettes in conjunction with stress analysis procedures. 740708. Stress Testing of Clark Model 45B Tractor Shovel. R. W. Hayden, Clark Equipment Co. The question of what constitutes a realistic stress testing program, how it is performed and then applied to earth-moving vehicles, is of prime interest to the design engineer. A general understanding of how the various tests are performed and their relationship to the total picture will enable the designer to work with testing personnel to develop vehicles that will have a minimum of structural problems in the field. Emphasis will be put on three basic stress testing procedures, namely static, pseudodynamic, and duty cycle field tests. 740709. Safety Testing of Fork Lift Trucks. D. W. Evans, Towmotor Corp. Continual attention by manufacturers is necessary to improve the safety testing of fork lift trucks both as to 133</page><page sequence="93">740709-740716 mechanical matters and fire hazard protection. This paper discusses the testing of these trucks to meet the required safety standards. Some of the criteria for design related to safety mentioned are stability, braking control, overhead guards, fork strength, and fire and explosion hazard protection. 1974 SAE Transactions 740710. The Role of the Independent Laboratory in Safety Certification Testing. Carl B. Yoder, United States Testing Co., Inc. The role of the independent testing laboratory in safety certification testing is discussed with specific examples of nationally recognized product certification programs. Both mandatory and voluntary standards and established methods of determining compliance with their require- ments are presented. Areas covered are manufacturer's self-certification, third-party certification programs, and labeling of manufactured products. 740711. The Role of a University in Machinery Safety Testing. William H. McConnell, University of Iowa. Safety testing is a present-day need in coping with consumerism in its voluntary and mandatory aspects. A university possessing unique capabilities describes its systematic approach to safety testing as it establishes a rationale consistent with academic goals. The sequence of steps used in devising realistic safety tests is discussed and specific examples are given. Research in safety testing enhances educational goals when new knowledge is used in teaching. 740712. Filmed Acoustical Materials and Their Appli- cation to Engine Compartments. Timothy Hira- bayashi, H. L. Blachford, Inc. This paper examines the need, use, and selection of filmed acoustical absorption materials for use in engine com- partments. The effects of various plastic film facings and enclosures on acoustical foams is discussed along with other foam absorption materials. 740713. Further Studies of Noise Characteristics of Internal Combustion Engine Exhaust Systems. S. W. Coates and G. P. Blair, The Queen's Uni- versity of Belfast. This paper describes a theoretical and experimental investigation of the noise characteristics of some basic internal combustion engine exhaust systems. On the basis of a one-dimensional analysis of the unsteady internal flow, the treatment is extended to consider the noise radiated by the efflux of gas from the atmospheric termination of the tail pipe. Using a rotary valve exhaust simulator, experimental pressure-time histories and one- third octave noise spectrograms were obtained. These are compared with those calculated. 740714. Noise Reduction Program for U.S. Army Con- struction Equipment. Paul D. Hopler and Samuel E. Wehr, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Re- search and Development Center. The U.S. Army Mobility Equipment R&amp;D Center em- barked on an overall program to reduce noise of construction equipment as a result of the low noise level requirements established by the Army Surgeon General. Since the level was interpreted to be the overall average noise, it was necessary to measure average noise and define a means of test as well as to design equipment to lowest possible levels. The initial program was to analyze the source of noise, reduce noise at the source, and provide overall noise reduction treatment to reach lowest practical levels. Similar efforts were then accomplished on several special military vehicles to provide noise reduction retrofit kits. The initial work revealed special needs in the area of hydraulic system noise, and acoustical materials and in-depth studies were initiated to analyze techniques of hydraulic noise measurement and to evaluate material suitability for military use. Tests were run on items of construction equipment during actual field operations to develop a system of measuring average noise. The results will be used to evaluate equipment noise in specifying practical levels. 740715. Fuel Droplet Size Distribution in Diesel Com- bustion Chamber. H. Hiroyasu and T. Kadota, University of Hiroshima. In order to determine spray droplet size in a diesel engine, fuel was injected into high-pressure, room-temperature gaseous environments with a diesel engine injection system. Droplet size was measured using the liquid immersion sampling technique with a mixture of water- methylcellulose solution and ethanol used as an immer- sion liquid for diesel fuel oil. The volume distribution of diesel spray droplets is well correlated with chi square distribution with freedom, &lt;/&gt; = 8, in the range of this investigation. The Sauter mean diameter increased with increasing back pressure, with the amount of fuel in a spray, and with decrease in pump speed. An empirical correlation was developed between effective injection pressure, air density, the quantity of the fuel delivery, and the Sauter mean diameter of spray droplets. 1974 SAE Transactions 740716. A Model for the Physical Part of the Ignition Delay in a Diesel Engine. Peter Sunn Pedersen and Björn Qvale, Technical University of Den- mark. A theoretical model for the physical part of the ignition delay period in a direct injection diesel engine is derived, based on single droplet calculations. It is used in a parametric study to examine the influence of air pressure and temperature, initial fuel temperature, and mean droplet size and velocity on the physical processes that precede the chemical reactions. 134</page><page sequence="94">740716-740726 The model is also used to correlate the results of an experimental investigation of the effects of using different pressures and different injection nozzles on the magnitude of ignition delay. 1974 SAE Transactions 740718. The Effect of Very Low Air Intake Temperature on the Performance and Exhaust Emission Char- acteristics of a Diesel Engine. G. A. Karim and S. Khanna, University of Calgary. The paper describes some of the operational and exhaust emission characteristics of a single-cylinder direct-injec- tion diesel engine that was operated warm under a wide range of intake air temperatures extending down to -45° F and occasionally -60° F. The operating range considered included the no-load and partially motored regions. 740719. Gas Flow Measurements in Engine Cylinders. M. J. Tindal, T. J. Williams and A. H. A. El Khafaji, University of London King's College. Interest in the measurement of gas flow in both spark ignition and compression ignition engine cylinders has increased since it has become evident that both swirl and turbulence can have an important influence on combus- tion and hence exhaust emissions. Among the methods available for indicating such flows, the hot wire ane- mometer would seem on balance to be the most suitable. Since the hot wire probe is sensitive to both mass flow rate and temperature of the gas, a circuit was devised which compensated automatically for variations in the latter. Measurements of gas velocity and turbulence were obtained during the induction and compression strokes of a motored 4-stroke engine in which the level of swirl could be varied by means of masked inlet valves. The validity of steady flow methods of assessing the swirl level associated with a given cylinder head geometry is discussed. 1974 SAE Transactions 740721. The Differential Compound Engine - Part 1: Steady-State and Emission Characteristics. F. J. Wallace and K. Sivakumaran, School of Engi- neering, University of Bath, England. Comprehensive experimental results obtained with a 4-stroke diesel engine are presented. Development of the differential compound engine in its present form, with flexible, multi-variable operating controls, is given in detail. Output shaft torque and power envelopes demonstrate both constant power and implied high torque backup. The possibility of stepless transmissions or, at most, a 2-forward/reverse ratio gearbox, makes the unit partic- ularly attractive for a wide range of transport applications. 740722. The Differential Compound Engine - Part 2: Transient Response of the Differential Compound Engine (DCE) Compared with Conventional Turbocharged Engines. F. J. Wallace, M. R. O. Hargreaves, D. E. Bowns and P. R. Cave, University of Bath (England). The paper describes experimental and analytical results for transient response of a prototype differential com- pound engine (DCE). It is shown that the transient response of the DCE is particularly favorable due to two inherent features: the low inertia associated with the fully floating epicyclic gearbox and inherently favorable trapped air fuel ratios. Comparisons between a hypothetical DCE and a similar turbocharged engine installed in a 24 ton truck bear out the findings on the prototype unit. 740723. Hyperbar System of High Supercharging. Jean Melchior and Thierry Andre-Talamon, Hyper- bar Diesel Co. This paper presents a new concept for very high super- charging of engines. Based on a novel combination of engine and turbocompressor, this concept enables the overall supercharge efficiency to be increased consid- erably which, taking into account recent advances in the field of gas turbines, can achieve pressure ratios of 9-10 without increasing the exhaust temperature of the engine. Applied to the engines of very low compression ratios (between 5 and 7), this method of supercharging enables continuous operation to be envisaged at a bmep of 35 kg/cm2, without increasing thermal and mechanical loads on the engine and without appreciable degradation of its efficiency. Test results are presented, applied on a fast engine at 26 kg/cm2 bmep and on an engine of average speed at 30 kg/cm2. 740724. A Constant Flow, Pressure Summated Hydraulic System as Applied to a Crawler Excavator. W. D. Symmank, Drott Manufacturing Corp. This paper discusses a simplified hydraulic system that summates the power requirements of all functions simul- taneously by diverting the major portion of the available engine power to any function or combination of functions as dictated by the work load of these functions. The system utilizes conventional fixed displacement pumps and series valves. 740725. Development of the Model 245 Excavator. N. K. Lammers, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The recently announced Model 245 excavator further extends Caterpillar Tractor Co.'s excavator line. The applications and the size of this machine presented some special problems to be solved during its development. The basic development program, the solutions to specific problem areas, and the resulting machine and its features are discussed. 740726. A Power Summation Control System for Fixed Displacement Pumps. Jim McBurnett, Tyrone Hydraulics, Inc.; and Billy J. Combs, Insley Subsidiary, Desa Industries, Inc. A new fluid power pump control system has been 135</page><page sequence="95">740726-740737 developed. This dual-sensing control system monitors the power demands of two separate hydraulic circuits and limits these demands over a wide range of combinations of pressures in each circuit. The technique provides a stepwise approximation to the familiar horsepower curve and results in a high degree of engine power utilization when applied to circuits such as the implement circuits of an excavator. The two-speed nature of the control system of each tandem pump extends beyond the implement circuit and allows manual or automatic two-speed track drive. It also provides reduced flow to the implement circuit for precise tool control even at maximum engine speed. 740728. Battery Charge Condition Monitoring. Clinton C. Christianson, Gould Labs., Gould Inc. Basic techniques are presented for determining the charge condition of electric vehicle propulsion batteries of both the lead-acid and nickel-cadmium types. The techniques presented include those employing measurement of battery parameters, such as electrolyte properties, voltage, and internal resistance, and those utilizing coulometric measurements. An application example employing the coulometric approach is described to demonstrate the usefulness of an accurate battery charge condition signal in an automated material handling car system. 740729. Design and Application of Traction Motors for Electric Vehicles. P. K. Lindhorst and J. C. Andreas, Gould Inc. The design of electric traction motors for electric vehicle applications requires intimate knowledge of the vehicle mission and performance requirements and a systems approach involving integration of the motor into the entire electrical power system. Motor characteristics are re- viewed, speed control possibilities are discussed, and factors to be considered in the application and selection of traction motors are explained in detail. 740730. Battery Powered Small Off-Highway Vehicles. A. J. Graumlich and C. V. Kern, Prestolite Elec- trical Div., ELTRA Corp. Small off-highway electric vehicle battery and propulsion systems require components designed to achieve the desired performance and maximize efficiencies. This paper gives an overview of typical components, their performance, size, shape, weight, and relationships to each other, and how they fit together in electric vehicle applications. Vehicle designs covered are golf cars, personnel carriers, people carriers, riding and walk-behind lawn mowers, 2- and 3-wheeled bikes, outboard motors, and floor care sweepers and scrubbers. Lift trucks are purposely excluded due to the maturity of their design. The discussion is limited to off-highway vehicles; how- ever, many of the approaches could be used for highway vehicles as well. 1974 SA E Transactions 740735. Snowmobile Engine Emissions and Their Impact. Charles T. Hare and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Thomas A. Hüls, Office of Mobile Source Air Pollution Control Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. This paper describes a research program on exhaust emissions from snowmobile engines, including both emissions characterization and estimation of national emissions impact. Tests were conducted on three popular 2-stroke twins and on one rotary (Wankel) engine. Emissions that were measured included total hydrocar- bons, (paraffinic) hydrocarbons by NDIR, CO, C02, NO (by two methods), NOx, 02, aldehydes, light hydrocar- bons, particulate, and smoke. Emissions of SOx were estimated on the basis of fuel consumed, and evaporative hydrocarbons were projected to be negligible for actual snowmobile operation. During emissions tests, intake air temperature was controlled to approximately -7°C (20 °F), and room air at approximately 24° C (75 °F) was used for engine cooling. Based on test results and the best snowmobile population and usage data available, impact of snowmobile emissions on a national scale were computed to be minimal.

McConnell, Department of Mechanical Engi- neering, The Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland). The performance characteristics of naturally aspirated 4-stroke cycle engines are influenced by the through-flow or exchange of fresh charge for exhaust gas during the valve overlap period. During this gas exchange period the influence of unsteady wave effects in both inlet and exhaust systems are most important. Pressure-time his- tories were measured at various tract locations for four inlet/exhaust configurations to demonstrate the effects of wave action on performance. The good correlation shown between measured and predicted pressure-time histories suggested that the the- oretical technique may be used in further design analyses with a high degree of confidence. 1974 SAE Transactions 740737. Exhaust Emissions from 2-Stroke Outboard Mo- tors and Their Impact. Charles T. Hare and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Thomas A. Hüls, Environmental Protection Agency. To characterize exhaust emissions from water-cooled 2-stroke outboard motors (the predominant type), four new motors were tested on dynamometer stands. The engines ranged from 4-65 hp in size, and operating conditions were chosen along lines of simulated boat loading. All the measurements were taken at steady-state conditions. 136</page><page sequence="96">740737-740745 Emission concentrations were measured in raw ex- haust gas and after the gases had been bubbled through water in a specially constructed tank. Constituents measured included hydrocarbons, CO, C02, NO, NOx, 02, light hydrocarbons, and aldehydes. Emissions of sulfur oxides (SOJ were estimated on the basis of fuel con- sumed, and all the exhaust emissions data were used with available information on population and usage of motors to estimate exhaust emission factors and national exhaust emissions impact. This study did not address the fate of pollutants in either air or water as a function of residence time, nor did it include any assessment of environmental effects due to outboard emissions.

Matching of High-Output Turbocharged Engines for Maximum Torque Backup and Emission Reduction Based on the Use of Variable Geom- etry Compressors and Turbines. F. J. Wallace and K. Sivakuraman, School of Engineering, University of Bath, England. Turbine performance programs based on relatively simple one-dimensional considerations of great value when investigating the effect of variable nozzle angle or turbocharger matching, and compressor programs based on a combination of one-dimensional flow formulations for rotor and diffuser are discussed. A complete survey has been carried out and the results show that by use of optimized turbine nozzle angle and compressor prewhirl schedules, a fueling schedule appropriate to high torque backup at just over half engine speed can be employed without exceeding the operating limits of the engine with respect to air/fuel ratio (A/F), exhaust temperature, or maximum cylinder pressure. 740739. Nonsteady Flow in a Turbocharger Nozzleless Radial Gas Turbine. Rowland S. Benson, The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (England). Results of an extensive test program investigating the nonsteady flow performance of a nozzleless radial gas turbine in a special rig show that the measured mass flow rate and power are different from predicted values using turbine steady flow test data. Furthermore, when the results are correlated against the form factor and pulse frequency, the overall mass flow predictions are sub- stantially independent of these two parameters but the power predictions are strongly influenced by them. Measured power to the predicted power based on steady flow data decreases as the pulse shape approaches sinusoidal form, thus indicating that the internal losses in the turbine are related to the nonsteady flow conditions within it. The tests showed that the form factor was dependent on pipe length, pulse frequency, mean pressure in the pipe, and turbine casing size. For the rig there was an optimum form factor for each combination of pipe, turbine casing, and mean pressure ratio across the turbine. It is deduced that the pulse shape is not only dependent on the normal factors, such as pipe diameter and length, and turbine cross-sectional area, but also on scroll length, and that this, in turn, influences the nonsteady flow within the turbine. 740740. Two-Stage Turbocharging of Diesel Engines: A Matching Procedure and an Experimental Inves- tigation. R. S. Benson, The University of Man- chester Institute of Science and Technology (England); and F. V. Světnička, Amalgamated Power Engineering Ltd. (England). A method is described for matching turbines and compressors for two-stage turbocharging of 4-stroke diesel engines. The method is illustrated for a series turbo- charged engine. Experimental results are presented which show that the method gives good predictions for the respective pressure ratios in the turbines and compressors and the overall engine performance. 1974 SA E Transactions 740742. Application Factors for Hydrostatic Transmis- sions in Skid-Steer Loaders. Loren Alderson, Cessna Fluid Power Div. The use of a hydrostatic drive system for a skid-steer loader can greatly improve the reliability and productivity over conventional belt drives. In order to obtain the maximum reliability and productivity, the engineer must consider several areas in applying a hydrostatic drive. This paper considers sizing of units, different types of systems for best cold weather starts, filtration, and available controls. 740743. Hydraulic Systems - Skid Steer Loads. David N. Prevallet, Gresen Manufacturing Co. Skid steer loaders are a natural application for the use of hydraulics. The lift systems utilize relatively simple control systems. Series control valves are gaining accep- tance as they give the operator full control at all times, and reduce the skill needed by the operator. The use of hydrostatic drive systems is also increasing, usually consisting of an independent system for each side of the vehicle. These systems provide the simple control and excellent maneuverability needed for these vehicles. 740744. The 3200 &amp; 3300 Series B Compact Loader Tractors. D. G. Owens, International Harvester Co. Two new compact loader tractors, the 3200B and 3300B, have been developed. This paper discusses some of their general features, and two features of importance - their fore and aft stability and the pivot-mounted drive system. In addition, the powertrain, transmission controls, and hydraulic system are covered. 740745. Further Developments of a 500 cc Single-Cyl- inder 2-Cycle Engine for Motorcycle Racing and 137</page><page sequence="97">740745-740785 Moto-Cross Applications. G. P. Blair, The Queen's University of Belfast. An earlier paper by Blair and Cahoon (SAE 710082) described the initial design and development of a 60 hp engine of the single-cylinder 2-cycle type for road racing motorcycle applications. This paper continues with the further design of this engine as a 65 hp 5-speed transmission unit and a variation of it as a 40 hp 4-speed transmission engine for moto-cross racing usage. A discussion of the application of the computer to the design of both engines is included. The computer design is used for the prediction of the required torque/speed charac- teristics for both engines for their particular application in order to eliminate lengthy test bed development. The mechanical design criteria for the engine/transmission units are also discussed and their implementation for the road race or moto-cross application described. 740746. Converting a Gasoline Air-Cooled Engine Pro- pane. Steve Seidlitz, Onan Div., Onan Corp. Conversion of an air-cooled gasoline engine to propane fuel can result in an engine with lower exaust emission, longer life, and less maintenance. The role of the carburetion system in mixing, the development of a novel liquid withdrawal system, and the importance of engine temperature were vital to this successful conversion. 740747. Adjustable Speed V-Belt Drives - Mechanical Properties and Design. B. G. Gerbert, Lund Technical University. This paper is a theoretical examination of both the manually and automatically regulated adjustable V-belt drive. Simple relations for external axial loads are assumed to show the analytical treatment of various axial loading equipment and the properties attained by the V-belt drive when different equipment are combined. It is demonstrated that some combinations give stable auto- matic drives while other combinations give unstable drives. 740776. (P-54) Why Private Carriage- Why Not? Robert A. Ingram, Blue Bell Services, div., Blue Bell, Inc. The decision to adopt private carriage for regular movement of freight by a manufacturer was a two-step process. The first step was the conclusion after study that air transportation had far more cost benefits than surface transport. Once this decision was reached, the various modes of air transportation - scheduled airlines, non- scheduled operators, and private carriage - were surveyed, and it was found that private carriage was the least costly mode. The experiences encountered and lessons learned in six years of private carriage are presented. 740777. (P-54) Expanding Air Freight Horizons by Use of the Airfreight Profitability Factor. David P. Herron, Stanford Research Institute. The traditional measure of potential for air freight movement of a product is its specific value ($ per lb.). There are other, equally important factors, all of which may be combined into an overall Air Freight Profitability Factor. A total cost model based on the AFPF shows that for most products safety stocks at the destination warehouse should be reduced, surface transportation employed for the predictable portion of the demand, and air freight for the unpredictable portion of the demand. There are substantial new markets for air freight with this concept. 740780. (P-54) Customs Clearance: Our Role and Yours. K. O. Stilling, Port Administration, Dept. of Customs and Excise (Australia). Faster Customs clearances can only be achieved if all parties - Customs, carriers, forwarders and agents (bro- kers) play their part and co-operate in this field. In Australia Customs, and shortly Customs Agents (brokers), will have developed an integrated computer system - but the carriers still regard air cargo as the Cinderella of the industry. 740782. (P-54) A Long Term Marketing Strategy for the Pacific - is it Possible? T. A. Loughead, Mc- Gregor Swire Air Services, Ltd. In devising a marketing strategy for the Pacific Basin, the air freight forwarder must take many different factors into consideration. These factors along with a brief history of the Pacific air freight market are presented in order to identify potential problems and several solutions that have come to light. It is clear that close cooperation is necessary between the forwarder and the carrier to solve many existing difficulties. 740784. (P-54) Charter - Pacific Potential. Barry S. Free- man, Clarkair International (A/SIA) Pty. Ltd. The growth of international air cargo charter in the Pacific region in recent years has been substantial. Shippers are turning more and more to charter as an alternative means of transporting their freight. Deterioration in the regu- larity of conventional shipping and increasing freight charges on scheduled aircraft services have also been responsible for the increase in demand for air charter. Airlines and their agents are now devoting more time and energy towards the marketing of the benefits of air charter to potential users. Air charter is a specialist field within the air cargo industry and requires dynamic and pro- gressive executives to present its many salient features to the market place. The charter industry can no longer be regarded as the black sheep in air cargo transportation and is surging ahead as a highly profitable and vital form of air movement. 740785. (P-54) Intermodality and the Freight Forwarder. James J. McNulty, Emery Air Freight Corp. This paper deals with the relationship between inter- modality and the freight forwarder. He begins by defining intermodality, which is a 138</page><page sequence="98">740785-740796 reciprocal interrelation between separate modes of car- riage through mutual action to improve the operating efficiency and enhance the end service products of the participating modes. The conclusion is reached that intermodality between air freight and connecting motor carriers is working reasonably well and some effort is being put forth on both sides to make it even better. 740786. (P-54) Mail by Air- It's Available- Are Air Carriers Ready to Move It? Joseph F. Jones, Operations Group, U.S. Postal Service. Most mail moves by surface transportation modes. As materials handling systems and intermodal transportation capabilities improve, mail moving more than 600 miles should go by air. 1.4 billion ton-miles of traffic a year are waiting for an imaginative and economical air transpor- tation proposal. The U.S. Postal Service has been pushing hard to get more mail in the air, despite strong opposition or lack of interest by airlines. The time for an intensive marketing approach to mail, by airlines, is overdue. 740787. (P-54) Will the International Community Let it Happen? A. W. G. Kean, Civil Aviation Au- thority of London (England). Intermodal transport creates many difficulties insofar as the handling of liability claims is concerned. Different conventions have been established in an attempt to solve these problems; and a brief review of these is presented. Also examined is an attempt by various countries to establish an international convention which would apply whenever goods are carried between two or more countries by two or more modes of transportation. Although many difficulties have arisen with this conven- tion, it is hoped that they may be ironed out and that the resolution be adopted. 740788. (P-54) The Future May Be Now. John T. Norris, Jr., Transport Systems Division, Office of Facil- itation, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, D.C. Project INTACT is a proposed government/industry program for a truly "intermodal" air cargo test. The program will demonstrate the movement of air freight in large intermodal containers and trailers that can efficient- ly and expeditiously be interchanged directly between air and surface modes of transportation. The ultimate goal of the demonstration is to spur the development of the air mode into an optimized "all mode" intermodal cargo system. The more immediate purposes are to substantiate technical and operational feasibility of the fully compat- ible intermodal air cargo system; to prototype test a particular intermodal system concept; and to verify that the needs of freight shippers can be fulfilled by such a system. 740789. (P-54) Air Freighters Designed for Shippers' Needs. Robert E. Hage and Lloyd B. Aschen- beck, Douglas Aircraft Company, Long Beach, California. Distribution of products by air will increase in importance as the economic transition develops. The air freight industry will gradually evolve from today's preponderance of narrow-body freighters through the current generation of wide-body lower hold and all-freighter aircraft. At a point in time when the major dollar portion of world trade will be shipped by air, the system will be dependent on very advanced technology, uncompromised all-freighters. The freighters will operate on an air freight network dedicated to service, economic development, and to raising living standards throughout the world. 740791. (P-54) Environment-Compatible Air Cargo Sys- tems. J. J. Cornish, III, Lockheed-Georgia Company, Marietta, Georgia. There have been numerous predictions on the coming of the air cargo boom and how we are preparing to meet the challenge of an all-cargo air transportation system. There are however, certain influences of a serious nature that have not been addressed. 740793. (P-54) Airfreight - Open Sesame to Exports. Thomas J. Harris, Management Enterprises, Inc. Shippers selling FOB origin lose sales in distant areas compared to local vendors since customers have a longer replenishment cycle entailing large inventories. Customers must pay inbound freight charges and money is tied up for longer periods of time. Changing to a sales policy of airfreight shipment with transportation costs absorbed by the shipper wipes out these disadvantages and permits market penetration comparable to that in shippers' home area. Contribution to fixed costs and profit on additional sales is often 35 percent or more which may exceed the airfreight cost providing a powerful tool for increasing exports and profits. 740794. (P-54) Products Looking for Air Distribution - Chairman's Remarks. Mark L. Requa, Trans World Airlines, Inc. To meet the needs of shippers and consignees who have products looking for air distribution, we must move toward greater maturity by looking at air distribution from the shipper's viewpoint and with a time perspective beyond today's routes, rates and schedules. The other side of the coin, "Air Distribution looking for Products", requires more maturity than the simplistic all or nothing approach of the past. It requires that we explore combinations of air and surface for optimum solutions for shippers. Finally, we must gain maturity in the application of airfreight as a marketing tool to increase sales and open new export opportunities. 740796. Engineers and Warranty. L. Ronald Modlin, Deere &amp; Company. A discussion of the fundamentals of current warranty law, 139</page><page sequence="99">740796-740805 this paper reviews legislation recently enacted or under consideration which will have a substantial effect on the warranty of the future. The responsibilities and potential impact of the design engineer are also considered. 740797. Yield Criteria for Predicting the Strength of Metals. Joseph J. Stanovsky, University of Texas at Arlington. Under certain conditions, metals and other solids deform plastically. There are two conditions which promote plastic deformation: the condition of stress and the mechanism which determines how that deformation takes place. The critical condition of stress which produces yielding is due to the net effect of the combination of stresses acting at a point. A mathematical theory which predicts the critical condition of stress for which plastic flow occurs is a yield criterion. A new yield criterion is introduced. It is hyperbolic in form so it is significantly different from the criteria developed by Rankine, Tresca, Saint- Venant, or von Mises. But like these criteria, the new yield condition is also limited to a biaxial stress condition. The new yield criterion, because of its form, serves as an instructive model for the development of an analytical equation of equivalent form. As a result, the new yield criterion can be interpreted as an energy equation which includes a mechanism related to how metals flow plastically. This mechanism can be related to small angle (gonio) distortions which develop in materials according to. a pattern or form (morphous) that is either fixed or controlled by the basic structure of the material and the condition of stress. As a result, this new criterion is identified as a goniomorphous yield criterion. The analytical equation is used as a pattern for two additional yield criteria. These new criteria predict yield for a three-dimensional condition of stress for two different deformation patterns. 740798. Structural Modeling of ROPS Under Dynamic Loading. Clarence E. Brown, David L. Olson and Terrill W. Woods, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. The use of scaled models for structural evaluation of new designs is becoming increasingly important from the standpoint of reduced lead time, costs, and space requirements. John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works has developed a dynamic structural modeling technique, based on roll-over protective structures (ROPS) safety compliance tests, which provides good correlation with full-scale results. This paper presents the development and application of this technique. 740801. Transient Shock Fragility and Hardness As- sessment of Commercial Communications Equip- ment. F. B. Safford, Agbabian Associates; and R. J. Tuttle, U.S. Army Safeguard Communi- cations Agency. Commercial communications (telephone) equipment em- ployed in a weapons system is mounted upon shock- isolated platforms for protection from nuclear-induced ground motion and air-blast loads. Analytic and empirical methods are used to derive a laboratory test environment for the equipment and a fragility test procedure is used to account for environmental uncertainties and test limi- tations. System hardening is achieved by way of design improvements introduced during the test program and as a result of the test program such that the system exceeds requirements. Fragility test levels are related to local threat environments to establish safety factors. 740803. Characterization of Shipboard Shock for Design and Test. T. K. Hasselman, J. H. Wiggins Co., W. N. Jones, Naval Weapons Center; and Gary C. Hart, J. H. Wiggins Co. and Department of Mechanics and Structures, University of Cali- fornia, Los Angeles. A method is described for modeling shipboard shock as a nonstationary stochastic process. Procedures for identi- fying key parameters of the simulated shock using measured shock records are discussed. Methods for evaluating probabilistic shock spectra to use as design criteria and laboratory simulation procedures for gener- ating a consistent test environment are presented. Exam- ples are included to illustrate the approach. 740804. Problems in Simulating the Effects of Complex Transients. Allen J. Curtis, Hughes Aircraft Co. During initial shock testing of an electro-optical device weighing approximately 100 lb, a number of catastrophic failures occurred under the shock test conditions specified for simulating the effects of firing the main armament of a tank. In addition, optical boresight shifts and permanent deformations of the cast-aluminum equipment housing were observed. At the same time, three identical devices which had been exposed in the field to a significant number of gunfirings in the tank exhibited no failures of either type. This paper discusses some of the problems which were examined during an investigation of the gunfire shock environment and the means by which its effects, or rather, absence of effects, could be simulated in the laboratory. The intent of the paper is not to break new ground but rather to discuss the several interacting parameters which enter into the simulation process and indicate the implications of the choice of values for these parameters. 740805. Specification and Simulation of Pyrotechnic Environments. L. G. Smith, Hughes Aircraft Co. This paper has been developed to present a brief summary of those practices which have evolved for specifying and performing tests to determine the functional and struc- tural integrity of aerospace components subjected to pyrotechnic shock. The shock specifications and test methods presented in the paper represent a broad view of industry practices. This paper could serve as a baseline for comparison with 140</page><page sequence="100">740805-740813 other methods that do exist, and could prove to be a reference point for further advancement of the field. 740806. Altitude Evaluation of a Variable Cycle Turbofan Engine. D. W. Stephenson and W. R. Daven- port, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of Ari- zona; and R. F. Topping, Aero Propulsion Laboratory, U.S. Air Force. This paper presents the results of an altitude test evaluation of a variable-cycle turbofan engine. The test engine was a medium-bypass, two-spool turbofan engine modified to incorporate variable inlet guide vanes and first-stage stators in the low-pressure compressor, variable first-stage stator vanes in the low-pressure turbine, and variable area fan and primary exhaust nozzles. The results of the testing indicated that these variable-geometry components offer potential improvements to the following problem areas in multimission aircraft at off-design conditions: inlet spillage drag and exhaust-system boattail drag, compressor surge-margin control, airframe bleed-air extraction effects on engine performance, and perform- ance limited by engine operating limits. 740807. LARZAC: A Small Turbofan Engine for Military and General Aviation Aircraft. Lawrence A. Chuslo and Harley D. Greenburg, Teledyne CAE. The Larzac turbofan engine, rated at 1318 deca Newtons (2965 pounds) thrust at sea level static, is now in final qualification as a powerplant for a new generation of military trainers, light strike fighters, and small business jets. The Larzac engine is being developed by two French companies through a joint controlling group known as Groupement TURBOMECA/SNECMA(GRTS). Tele- dyne CAE has an exclusive agreement with GRTS to market, sell and service the Larzac in the United States and Canada, and also has an option to manufacture the engine. This paper discusses the Larzac engine design, development, flight test, preliminary qualification test and manufacture. 740809. Research and Development of the FJR710 Turbo- fan Engine. Masakatsu Matsuki and Tadao Torisaki, National Aerospace Laboratory (Ja- pan); Kiyoto Miyazawa and Mototsugu Itoh, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (Japan). Research and development of high bypass ratio turbofan engines have been conducted in Japan since 1971. Three prototype engines have been built and tested and have met design specifications. The project is conducted under the National Research and Development Program of the Japanese Government. The engineering background of the project's initiation is reviewed. The purpose and management of the system are discussed. The objectives and master schedule as well as engine specifications and design features of the engine are presented. The state of development of the engine, including performance data and problems encountered, are reviewed. 740810. Producer Certification - A Cost-Effective Ap- proach to Parts Inspection. Ted C. Fisher, Hamilton Standard Div. of United Aircraft Corp. This paper recounts the experience and ensuing results of the implementation of producer certification in its main factory area by the Hamilton Standard Div. of United Aircraft Corp. Producer certification, applicable to both purchased and shop material, is the assumption of the inspection function by the producing organization. The concept is not new - it has long been practiced in some companies - but its acceptance by the aerospace industry has been slow. The paper describes three quality assurance tasks successively transferred to the producing organization and the succeeding results, and concludes with a comparison of Hamilton Standard performance and cost experience under its conventional quality assurance system and the producer certification system. 740811. Ultrasonic Applications in the Aerospace Indus- try. Don Hagemaier, McDonnell Douglas Corp. This paper discusses state-of-the-art ultrasonic testing as used to inspect and evaluate parts and materials for aerospace systems. The paper is divided into four sections: purpose of testing; basic requirements for application, such as equipment, reference standards, and acceptance criteria; standard applications, such as wrought metal products, tubing and pipe welded assemblies, thickness and corrosion, fiber-reinforced composites, adhesive- bonded assemblies, brazed and diffusion-bonded assem- blies, aircraft maintenance inspection, attenuation, and grain-boundary reflections; and research and develop- ment applications, such as the liquid-level detector, titanium hydride detector, measurement of applied stress, ultrasonic extensiometer, ultrasonic modulus versus me- chanical properties for fiber composites, ultrasonic spec- troscopy, acoustic holography, and critical angle reflec- tivity. 1974 SA E Transactions 740812. Process Control Techniques in Airplane Manu- facturing. C. R. Cunningham, Boeing Commer- cial Airplane Co. This paper presents an explanation of reasons process control is used in airplane manufacture. A discussion of cadmium plating, structural bonding, and machining provides examples of current control of these processes. 740813. Development and Application of Ride-Quality Criteria. David G. Stephens, Langley Research Center, NASA. A program for the development of ride-quality vibration criteria applicable to the design and evaluation of air and surface transportation systems is described. Consideration 141</page><page sequence="101">740813-740823 is given to the magnitude of vehicle vibration experienced by the passenger, the frequency of vibration, the direction of vibration, and the influence of seat dynamics on passenger response. Comparative vibration measurements are presented for a variety of air and surface transpor- tation systems. In addition, simulator data on seat dynamics and passenger response are presented. Results suggest the relative merits of various physical descriptors and measurement locations for characterizing the vibra- tion in terms suitable for the design and/or evaluation of transportation systems. 740814. Specification and Correlation of the Sine Vibra- tion Environment for Viking '75. R. E. Snyder, Langley Research Center, NASA; M. Trummel and B. K. Wada, Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and J. C. Pohlen, Martin Marietta Corp. The Viking project is managed by the Viking project office at Langley Research Center for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Two Viking spacecraft will be individually launched on a new Titan IIIE/Centaur D-1T launch vehicle in August 1975. The method for the establishment of spacecraft sine vibration test levels prior to availability of any Titan IIIE/Centaur D-1T flight data by use of both computer simulations and data from previous Titan and Atlas Centaur vehicles is described. The specification level is compared with actual flight data obtained from a proof flight launch of the Titan IIIE/Centaur D-1T and a Viking dynamic simulator in January 1974. An objective of the proof flight launch was to obtain estimates of the flight loads and environments. The criteria used to minimize the structural weight that would result from an unmodified application of a sine test environment are described. During the sine test, the loads in the primary structural members are limited to values based on computed flight loads. The frequency range of load limitation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the loads analysis procedure. 740815. Improved Vibration Design and Test Procedure for Aircraft. Clark J. Beck, Jr., Boeing Aerospace Co. Recent experience with vibration qualification of avionics for the B-l airplane has revealed deficiencies in commonly used vibration design and test procedures. Specific examples of deficiencies are discussed. Recommendations for improving vibration design and test procedures are presented in the areas of environment prediction, quali- fication testing, and use of vibration isolators. Suggestions are made relative to vibration design and testing in light of the "try-before-buy" concept. 740817. U.S. Navy Lamps Operations Report. Roger M. Boh, Jr., U.S. Navy. The light airborne multipurpose system (LAMPS) is a destroyer/helicopter system designed to extend the anti- submarine warfare and surveillance capabilities of de- stroyer class ships beyond the horizon. The LAMPS program consists of two principal elements: the MK I system using modified H-2 helicopters aboard modified DASH ships, which has been operational since 1971; and the follow-on MK III system, with greatly increased capability, which is in full-scale development. The LAMPS concept has been proved and fully accepted by the fleet. All new surface combatants will have the capability of operating helicopters. 740818. The Canadian Destroyer-Borne Helicopter Pro- gram. C. M. Curleigh, Canadian Forces. The Canadian Forces have developed a capability of safely operating a 19,000 lb anti-submarine helicopter from an escort-sized naval ship at night, in conditions of reduced visibility and in sea states which cause the ship to roll as much as 30 deg. This paper reviews the devel- opment of this program, outlines the current capabilities and limitations of the system, and discusses the Canadian concept of operating destroyer-borne helicopters. 740820. Maritime VSTOL - The Development of Small Ship Helicopter Operations in the Royal Navy. D. B. Bathurst, Royal Navy, Ministry of De- fence (U.K.). The Royal Navy now deploys helicopters in all its escorts. The pattern and concept of operations from small ships have evolved over the years and detailed study of the control, landing, and deck handling of the helicopter have affected both ship and aircraft design. Similarly, a maintenance and support organization has grown out of the need to supervise the activities of over 40 separate embarked units. 1974 SA E Transactions 740822. Test Techniques for Obtaining Off-Nominal Compressor Data During Engine Tests. Thomas J. Biesiadny, Lewis Research Center, NASA. Several unique techniques and related devices are in use at the Lewis Research Center for off-design testing of fan and compressor sections in full-scale jet engines. The devices presented not only permit a wide range of experimental conditions but also minimize downtime for hardware changes. The techniques involve use of such devices as inlet pressure distortion jets, a hydrogen burner for inlet temperature distortions, fan back pressure jets to simulate a variable area nozzle, and either an inflow- outflow bleed system or a fuel spurt system to alter compressor discharge pressure. 740823. Utilization of a Dual Spool Compressor Test Facility to Aid Development of Turbofan Engines. A. Walter Stubner and Ellis Canal, Jr., Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The development of compression systems for advanced twin-spool turbofan engines became increasingly more difficult as stability, performance, weight, and cost reduction goals were increased. Experience indicated that 142</page><page sequence="102">740823-740835 single-spool compressor component tests did not com- pletely duplicate stability limits determined by flight engine tests. A requirement existed for a component test technique to develop the entire twin-spool compression system in a simulated engine environment, with sufficient operating flexibility to reproduce critical operating points that might be incurred during actual engine operation. The Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft dual-spool compressor facility was designed and built to meet this requirement. The dual-spool facility has been employed in the devel- opment of several advanced models of the JT9D engine, in the JT10D demonstration engine development pro- gram, and in a U.S. Air Force sponsored program (F33615-70-C-1549, sponsored by AFAPL), which em- ployed the TF30 compression system to investigate the nature of dual-spool interactions. Comparison of the JT9D dual-spol test data with engine flight test experience has demonstrated a high degree of correlation. The Air Force program showed that compression system insta- bilities can be induced in either component and can have a variety of dynamic characteristics, depending upon the operating condition prior to the instability. This paper describes such a facility as it was conceived and built at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft and also summa- rizes a few of the more important programs to which the facility has been applied. 740824. Supersonic Inlet Simulator - A Tool for Simu- lation of Realistic Engine Entry Flow Conditions. William F. Kimzey, ARO, Inc.; and Stanley H. Ellis, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. Serious difficulties have been experienced in the devel- opment of some supersonic aircraft due to engine stability problems arising from previously unknown characteristics of the flow field at the engine-inlet interface plane. To ensure against further unknowns, an F-15 inlet simulator was designed, constructed, and installed in an altitude test cell for realistic engine testing with inlet flow distortions. The simulator has the aerodynamic shape of the F-15 inlet from the second ramp to the engine inlet plane. Interface flow conditions are produced by accelerating air through a two-dimensional nozzle to duplicate the last oblique shock wave of the aircraft inlet. The terminal shock, spillage past the cowl lip, and inlet bleeds are reproduced. Forebody effects, angle of attack, and sideslip can be simulated. Scale model tests used to develop the simulator concept are reviewed. Experimental results from the full-scale inlet simulator are presented showing the ability to reproduce time-variant inlet flow fields, including the most severe inlet patterns, buzz, and hammershock. Engines can be tested with the combined destabilizing effects of power lever transients, Reynolds number, time-variant distor- tions, and planar pulsations. 1974 SAE Transactions 740825. On-Line Calibration of High-Response Pressure Transducers During Jet-Engine Testing. E. C. Armentrout, NASA-Lewis Research Center. Current jet engine testing is concerned with the effect of inlet pressure and temperature distortions on engine performance and involves the use of numerous miniature pressure transducers. Despite recent improvements in the manufacture of miniature pressure transducers, they still exhibit sensitivity change and zero shift with temperature and time. To obtain meaningful data, a calibration system is needed to determine these changes. A system has been developed which provides for computer selection of appropriate reference pressures selected from nine dif- ferent sources to provide a two- or three-point calibration. Calibrations are made on command, before and some- times after each data point. A unique "no leak" matrix valve design is used in the reference-pressure system. Zero-shift corrections are measured and the values are automatically inserted into the data reduction program. 1974 SAE Transactions 740831. F-12 Inlet Development. David H. Campbell, Lockheed-California Co. The aerodynamic design of the F-12 engine air inlet is discussed following development from its inception to the present configuration. A description of the various tests related to the inlet is presented, along with some of the tests results. The importance of engine, inlet, and ejector matching is discussed. Close coordination between the airframe and engine manufacturer allowed the selection of an airframe-mounted ejector with inherent performance advantages. The nozzle requirements affected the final selection of the inlet bleed system. Early testing of inlet distortion on the engine compressor rig helped provide adequate engine stall margins. Comparison of early one-eighth scale model data with recent NASA test and flight data is included. 1974 SAE Transactions 740832. J58/YF-12 Ejector Nozzle Performance. Paul W. Herrick, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, div., United Aircraft Corp. The Lockheed YF-12 aircraft uses a blow-in door ejector nozzle, which consists of a variable area, primary nozzle mounted on the afterburner of a Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft J58 engine and blow-in doors, a convergent-divergent spool piece, and variable exit area free-floating flaps integrated into a Lockheed YF-12 airframe. Performance data from cold-flow, wind tunnel models and hot-flow, static stand models were correlated and compared with actual flight test data. It was found that these data showed agreement when both internal thermodynamic and exter- nal aerodynamic effects were considered. 740835. Improved Metal Recovery by the Solabond Diffusion Bonding Process. E. C. Thorsrud, F. K. Rose and A. G. Metcalfe, Solar Division of International Harvester Co. The Solabond process of diffusion bonding has been applied to structures in steels, superalloys, and titanium with growing applications in aircraft, gas turbine, and 143</page><page sequence="103">740835-740849 industrial fields. The process is relatively new but growing rapidly as it is becoming increasingly accepted. It offers significant advantages in improved material recovery and hence in reduced energy consumption. The increasing importance of material recovery and energy savings in the years to come will ensure greater consideration of this method of manufacture. 1974 SA E Transactions 740836. Isothermal Shape Rolling of Net Sections. A. G. Metcalfe, W. J. Carpenter and F. K. Rose, SOLAR Division of International Harvester Co. Isothermal metal working (ISR) using resistance heating of the metal being worked is a new process developed by the Solar Division of International Harvester. The process is unique and can be used effectively to roll structural as well as special shapes from various alloys including titanium, stainless steel, and superalloys. Sheet or plate stock can be rolled into Z-section stiffeners and channels with square external corners and internal fillets. Bar stock can be rolled into "I" and "T" sections in one- or two-roll passes. Airfoils for gas turbine blades and vanes can be formed with rolls profiled with the contour shapes desired. The general characteristics of the processes are described. These include: high metal recovery (better than 90%); fine surface finish (16 rms); freedom from surface contamination; major thickness reductions per pass (better than 80%); control of microstructure; and very low energy consumption in processing. These characteristics result in major cost reductions when compared with the existing methods of manufacture. 1974 SA E Transactions 740842. F-14A Status Report: Operational Capabilities, Program Accomplishments, and Cost. Michael Pelehach, Grumman Aerospace Corp. The first two F-14A fighter squadrons have deployed to the Pacific area 53/4 years from contract signing. The entire weapon system of the F-14A has been completely demonstrated. Phoenix missiles have intercepted Foxbat, multiple-target, Backfire, and cruise-missile targets. F- 14 As have demonstrated outstanding maneuverability both subsonically and supersonically. The F-14A is the first Navy fighter which possesses the same maneuvering and operating envelope. Five F-14A squadrons are operational with Marine and Iranian F-14As under construction. F-14A aircraft are being maintained with less maintenance man-hours and fewer personnel than the F4J Phantom. F-14A costs are predictable, due to a long production outlook and annual buys. 740843. Design, Integration, and Testing of the F-15. Hermon H. Cole, McDonnell Aircraft Co. The F-15 is a new generation air superiority fighter built by McDonnell Aircraft Co. for the U.S. Air Force. The aircraft is well along in its contractor development test and evaluation. Air Force development test and evalu- ation started in the spring of 1974, and operational aircraft will be delivered to the Air Force in the Fall of 1974. The F-15 represents the first Air Force fighter weapon system with firm contract milestones developed under the U.S. Department of Defense concept of "Fly Before Buy." This new weapon system has called for new concepts in program management and new approaches to design, integration, and testing to meet its operational and contrac turai requirements. 740846. Design and Development of a Gas Turbine Powered Silent Power Package. William M. Owen and Jerry S. Todd, Solar Div., Inter- national Harvester Co. The Solar Division of International Harvester Co. has designed, fabricated, and tested a sound-attenuated enclosure for the standard 10 kw turboalternator gen- erator set previously developed by Solar. The enclosure was designed to achieve essentially silent power per- formance by being inaudible at a distance of 100 m under extremely quiet backgrounds. 740847. Maintenance Considerations in Aircraft-Deriva- tive Industrial Gas Turbines. J. K. Goodwine and R. C. Stradley, United Airlines. The past decade has seen a rapid growth in the utilization of industrial gas turbines derived from aircraft jet engines. Maintenance concepts originally developed for flight engines can be adopted for these industrial gas turbines with substantial savings in maintenance expense for the operator. The paper reviews maintenance logistics, in- cluding the special problems encountered in providing support for a new model engine, discusses some common service problems, and provides an analysis of one operator's repair experience. 740848. The Transition from Effective Aircraft Engine Control to Effective Industrial Engine Control. F. F. Hutton, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The Allison T56 turboprop aircraft engine has been modified and converted into an efficient industrial powerplant. As a part of this transition, the aircraft engine control system had to undergo certain changes to adapt it for regulation of industrial engines. The differences in engine applications, installations, duty cycle requirements, etc. were some of the considerations that had to be taken into account in the effort of making the industrial control system as effective as its aerospace counterpart. These problems and the approach to their solutions are discussed in this paper. 740849. Performance Development History - 10 kw Turboalternator. C. Rodgers, Solar Div., Inter- national Harvester Co. The performance development history of a small gas turbine for the U.S. Army 10 kW turboalternator is discussed. The design incorporates a single-stage cen- 144</page><page sequence="104">740849-740859 trifugal compressor and single-stage radial inflow turbine, mounted back-to-back on a common shaft rotating at 93,500 rpm and directly coupled to a variable frequency solid alternator. Total accumulated running time, at rated speed during development, exceeded 20,000 h; in addi- tion, a 2000 start/stop test was successfully completed. Gas turbine performance was found to be quite sensitive to compressor and turbine clearances as a consequence of the small compressor and turbine blade heights. With accurate control of these clearances, it was possible to attain average engine specific fuel consumptions meeting contract requirements of 1.1 lb/hp-h with a low rated turbine inlet temperature of 1330°F. 740850. Quasi-Tbree-Dimensional Flow Solution by Meridional Plane Analysis. Theodore Katsanis and William D. McNally, Lewis Research Center. A computer program has been developed to obtain subsonic or shock-free transonic, nonviscous flow analysis on the hub-shroud midchannel flow surface of a turbo- machine. The analysis may be for any annular passage, with or without blades. The blades may be fixed or rotating and may be twisted and leaned. The flow may be axial, radial, or mixed. Blade surface velocities over the entire blade are approximated, based on the rate of change of angular momentum. This gives a three-dimensional flow picture based on a two-dimensional analysis. This paper discusses the method used for the program and shows examples of the type of passages and blade rows which can be analyzed. Also, some numerical examples are given to show how the program can be used for practical assistance in design of blading, annular passages, and annular diffusers. 1974 SA E Transactions 740852. An LN2 Fuel Tank Inerting System for Com- mercial Transports. Kenneth R. Bragg, Parker- Hannifin Corp. This paper presents what is considered to be the optimum fuel tank inerting system for commercial transport aircraft. It stresses the inherent simplicity made possible by use of liquid nitrogen for the source of inert gas. It also reviews some of the fundamentals involved in removing oxygen from fuel and presents a new concept for removing dissolved oxygen from fuel with no moving parts and no additional nitrogen. 1974 SA E Transactions 740854. Hollow-Fiber Permeable Membrane for Airborne Inert Gas Generation. Scott A. Manatt, AiRe- search Manufacturing Co. of California. A hollow-fiber, permeable-membrane, air-separation module is being developed for applications to aircraft fuel tank inerting systems. The module reduces the oxygen content of air below the limit for flame propagation, allowing the use of the processed air as an inert gas. Unlike previous cryogenic nitrogen inerting systems, onboard inert gas generation fuel tank inerting systems operate without the need for regular ground servicing or large airborne storage capacity, thereby offering sub- stantially reduced weight. 740855. Thin Film Permeable Membranes for Inert Gas Generation. Warella Browall, John W. Harrison and Robert Salemme, General Electric Co. A new ultrathin-backed semipermeable membrane has been developed which shows considerable promise as a gas separator for engine bleed air to provide nitrogen-rich air for aircraft fuel tank inerting. The membrane is a silicone, polycarbonate copolymer of 1500 À effective thickness, deposited on a reinforced porous backing. The selective removal of oxygen provides oxygen concentra- tions of less than 9% in the inerting gas. Small-scale testing demonstrated that the backed membranes are suitable in the aircraft environment. A system using such membranes avoids the logistic and service requirements of tanked liquid nitrogen. 740856. Aircraft Fuel Tank Inerting by Catalytic Fuel Combustion. J. Rousseau and G. H. McDonald, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of California; and Gregory W. Gandee, Air Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory. A flight-configured catalytic reactor suitable for aircraft fuel tank inerting by oxidation of jet fuel in flight has been successfully developed. Inert gas stream oxygen concen- trations below 1% were achieved repeatedly when oper- ating at near-stoichiometric fuel-air ratios. Reactor con- struction and thermal control features were validated through 60 h of testing over a wide range of operating conditions. The weight of a complete fuel tank inerting system capable of delivering 52 lb/min of inert gas is estimated at 305 lb, and its size is 19 X 24 X 55 in; this represents a significant savings when compared to current techniques of fuel tank inerting. 1974 SA E Transactions 740859. HiMAT - A New Approach to the Design of Highly Maneuverable Aircraft. Donald R. Bell- man, Flight Research Center, NASA; and David A. Kier, National Aeronautics &amp; Space Admin- istration. Needed improvements in the maneuvering performance of combat aircraft appear to be possible through the simultaneous application of advances in various disci- plines in such a way that they complement one another and magnify the benefits derived. The highly maneu- verable aircraft technology (HiMAT) program is being conducted to investigate such multidisciplinary concepts. The program has three phases: preliminary studies, conceptual design studies, and the final design and construction of a test airplane. Work is now in the second phase. The test airplane will be a scaled model flown by a remotely piloted research vehicle technique. This paper 145</page><page sequence="105">740860-740864 outlines the HiMAT program and indicates the types of concepts being considered. 740860. AFTI TI-1 Program. Raymond L. Haas, Wayne M. O'Connor and Daniel E. Fraga, U.S., Air Force Systems Command. The Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI) program is a concept for accelerating the transition of high payoff technologies through the development stage into systems application. It is conceived as a mechanism to focus the technology development of the Air Force Systems Command laboratories and to provide con- clusively demonstrated new technologies to the system development organizations efficiently. The total program is viewed as a continuing process of selecting high payoff technologies as they mature and integrating them into appropriate configurations for manned flight demonstra- tion and validation. The first program to incorporate the AFTI approach is called Technology Integration- 1 (TI-1). The purpose of this program is to focus on technologies that enhance the subsonic and transonic maneuver, convergence, and tracking capability appropriate to air-to-air and air- to-ground operations. The first portion of the AFTI TI-1 phase 1 contracts were completed with the recommendation by each contractor of a preferred demonstrator configuration. These studies systematically examined the maturity of the technologies, their applicability to projected future sys- tems, and the viability of demonstrating them on a manned demonstrator vehicle. The contractors are now proceeding with Task II of the current contract, during which they will refine their selected designs to provide the credibility and confidence necessary to approve con- struction and flight test of the AFTI TI-1. 740861. F-4/CCV-Flight Tests of Advanced Technology. Dwight H. Bennett, McDonnell Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Previous studies indicated the F-4 fly-by-wire (surfaces controlled by electrical signals rather than by mechanical inputs) aircraft to be a good test bed for flight tests of advanced concepts. In particular, the advanced technol- ogy control configured vehicle (design for control, rather than stability, in initial design phase) concepts of a short-coupled horizontal canard (control surface forward of the wing) and relaxed static longitudinal stability were shown to have large performance benefits for man- euvering flight conditions in the combat arena. The short-coupled canard has slat-like favorable interference effects on the wing lift and drag characteristics, regardless of whether leading edge slats are or are not installed on the wing. Development of the company-sponsored pre- cision aircraft control technology aircraft to flight status was not without challenges, but these were satisfactorily met. Flight tests have verified the predicted performance benefits, while providing additional reliability/maintain- ability data on fly-by-wire control systems. 740862. Development of Hot-Isostatically Pressed and Forged P/M Rene 95 for Turbine Disc Appli- cation. J. L. Bartos and R. E. Allen, General Electric Co.; V. R. Thompson and J. H. Moll, Crucible Materials Research Center; and C. A. Morris, Wyman-Gordon Co. Previous studies had demonstrated the economic and technical feasibility of producing high-quality forgings for aircraft turbine engine parts from hot-isostatically pressed (HIP) Rene 95 powder billets. The present program was aimed at developing a production practice for making HIP -I- forged turbine discs. The major goal was improved product fabricability and reliability with minimum cost. The program was conducted using argon atomized Rene 95 powder. Experimental studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of powder characteristics, HIP param- eters, preform design, and forging conditions on forge- ability, microstructure, and mechanical properties. The results of these studies were incorporated into a pilot production run in which 10 disc forgings were made and evaluated. The selected process involved the consolidation of -60 mesh powder to full density by hot-isostatic pressing at a temperature above the y ' solvus temperature. This compaction process develops a desirable starting micro- structure. Subsequent forging below the y' solvus tem- perature develops the required "necklace" (partially recrystallized) microstructure. The properties of the resulting product were found to exceed specification requirements. Furthermore, pilot production has dem- onstrated the reliability and reproducibility of the process. 740863. Welding With a High-Power C02 Laser. W. C. Ball, Hamilton Standard Div. of United Tech- nologies Corp.; and C. M. Banas, Research Laboratories, United Technologies Research Center. The application of a production-oriented high-power C02 laser system for the welding of auto underbody com- ponents is reported. Sheet metal sections, varying in thickness from 0.060-0.135 in, are welded at speeds up to 500 in/min at 6 kW. An overview of recent developments in laser welding is presented along with a discussion of the laser deep-penetration weld phenomenon. A comparison is made between laser and electron-beam welding per- formance. 1974 SA E Transactions 740864. Metal-Working Capability of a High Power Laser. Frederic D. Seaman, Sciaky Bros., Inc.; and Edward V. Locke, Avco Everett Research Laboratory, Inc. This paper lists seven criteria often considered by production and design engineering organizations when assessing new manufacturing processes for products such as aviation or industrial gas turbines. The characteristics of the H PL industrial laser are assessed in terms of each of the seven criteria. 146</page><page sequence="106">740865-740875 In support of this discussion, design features of the laser are described. The manner in which one laser can operate several work stations is also described. Examples of how the laser has been used to cut, weld, harden surfaces, and alloy local areas of a workpiece are given. The application of the laser to gears, camshafts, pistons, and valve seats is described. 1974 SA E Transactions 740865. Implications of Multiplane-Multispeed Balancing for Future Turbine Engine Design and Cost. Robert H. Badgley, Mechanical Technology Inc. This paper describes several alternative approaches, provided by multiplane-multispeed balancing, to tradi- tional gas turbine engine manufacture and assembly procedures. These alternatives, which range from addition of trim-balancing at the end of the traditional assembly process to modular design of the rotating system for assembly and balancing external to the engine, require attention by the engine designer as an integral part of the design process. Since multiplane-multispeed balancing may be incorporated at one or more of several points during manufacture-assembly, its deliberate use is ex- pected to provide significant cost and performance (reduced vibration) benefits. Moreover, its availability provides the designer with a firm base from which he may advance, with reasonable assurance of success, into the flexible rotor dynamic regime. 740870. Advanced Composite Design Concepts for the AMST. W. D. Nelson, Douglas Aircraft Com- pany, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, California; and D. A. Roselius, Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. In this study, graphite-epoxy composite materials are used in conceptual design of major structural portions of an advanced medium STOL transport (AMST) aircraft. Low-cost design concepts combined with innovative manufacturing techniques contribute to a unit cost reduction of $760,000 and a life-cycle cost saving of $474 million for a resized composite aircraft using pitch-based fiber, and maintaining the same performance as the larger baseline metal aircraft. When the composite design weight savings were converted to performance improvements, rather than to resizing, the vehicle could carry 20.4- percent more payload weight, fly the baseline payload 46.3 percent farther, or take off from a 6-percent shorter runway. 740872. Communication Satellite Control Systems. Gerald Adams, Space and Communications Group, Hughes Aircraft Co. During the last 12 years, global communication via earth satellites has grown from an experimental status to fully operational international and domestic systems. These satellites have utilized spin stabilization for the most part because of its inherent simplicity and high reliability. Moreover, the evolution in spin stabilization technology has kept pace with increasingly stringent payload pointing requirements that have arisen due to use of higher frequencies and spot beams for selected area coverage. This paper deals with attitude control technology as it applies to typical communications satellites. The basic stabilization problem is stated in terms of the system requirements and perturbations such as environmental disturbances and the effects of internal fuel slosh. Next, design practices and hardware technology are reviewed for the current generation of dual-spin satellites. Reaction jets, sensors, nutation dampers, and despin bearing assemblies are the principal hardware elements consid- ered. Two types of control system configuration are discussed: one using onboard pulse data and one deriving a continuous error signal from a ground beacon. Finally, some future trends in satellite attitude control technology are discussed. 740873. Missile Guidance and Control System Design Trends. Leo C. George, TRW Systems Group. This paper describes selected guidance and control (G and C) concepts that are currently being considered for use on one or more advanced missile systems and, in the opinion of the author, represent trends in missile G and C system design. The guidance system concept to be described in the floated inertial measurement ball (FLIMBAL), and the control system concept is based on the single movable nozzle design configuration. In addition, a description of selected design trends applicable to both guidance and control system hardware is presented which includes inertial instruments, elec- tronics design, nuclear hardness considerations, and data transmission techniques. 740874. Three-Axis Attitude Control for Solar-Powered Electric Propulsion Spacecraft. H. Karl Bouvier, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Solar electric propulsion (SEP) provides a unique capa- bility for interplanetary missions, although spacecraft designs based on solar power, developed by large flexible arrays, lead to formidable vehicle interactions with attitude control. Control techniques must be developed for both thrusting and nonthrusting modes of operation. The challenges to be faced are the development of new control concepts and the design analysis for vehicle/con- trol interaction. Control design tradeoffs are discussed to show the rationale for present designs and to indicate future concerns. It is concluded that the state-of-the-art of control system design is mature enough to support an SEP spacecraft for such heliocentric missions as rendezvous or slow flyby of the comet Encke or out-of-the ecliptic missions in the 1980s. 740875. Space Shuttle Orbiter Guidance and Control System Design. Glenn M. Minott and Eugene A. O'Hern, Space Division, Rockwell International. An overview of the current space shuttle orbiter baseline 147</page><page sequence="107">740875-740884 guidance and control system is presented. The vehicle configuration, emphasizing the variety of control effectors utilized throughout the sequence of mission phases (wherein the vehicle functions successively as a rocket, spacecraft, entry vehicle, and airplane) is outlined, and the guidance and control techniques employed in the various phases and modes are presented. Finally, the manner in which the redundant, fly-by-wire guidance and control system is mechanized - utilizing a digital processing system - to meet stringent weight and reliability require- ments is described. 740876. Commercial Application of Rocket Technology to Waterjet Propulsion. H. O. Oquist and H. L. Barham, Rocketdyne Division/Rockwell Inter- national, Canoga Park, California. The technology of waterjet propulsion has reached a state of development where discussion of all technical aspects is beyond the scope and intent of this paper. The utilization and expansion of liquid rocket engine pump technologies derived from the U.S. military and space programs will be described, design of a single-stage axial flow pump for a new fast passenger hydrofoil will be discussed, and key benefits and features of waterjet systems will be discussed throughout the paper. The paper concludes with a forecast of possible uses for waterjet systems. 740877. Thrust Vector Control Flex Joints - Commercial Applications. John T. Herbert and Charles M. Reinhardt, Lockheed Propulsion Comp. The need for high-pressure articulating pipe couplings for advanced shipboard application and for the new deep- water piping systems is being satisfied by an extension of aerospace technology-the flexible elastomeric seal. The flexible elastomeric seal was first developed at Lockheed Propulsion Comp, in 1963 and since that time has seen application on thrust vector control systems of rocket motor systems. Its recent application to commercial products is described in this paper. Other future appli- cations in this area are expanding. 1974 SA E Transactions 740878. Rocket Engine Heat Transfer and Material Technology for Commercial Applications. John Campbell and John Hiltabiddle, Rocketdyne Division/Rockwell International, Canoga Park, California. Liquid fueled rocket engine combustion, heat transfer, and material technology have been utilized in the design and development of compact combustion and heat exchange equipment intended for application in the commercial field. An initial application of the concepts to the design of a compact steam generator to be utilized by electrical utilities for the production of peaking power is described. 740879. Some Commercial Applications of Aerospace Technology. Ivan J. Jaszlics, Martin Marietta Aerospace, Denver, Colorado. Government-supported research and development work significantly supplements privately financed industrial R&amp;D as the basis for new commercial products. Many technologies now in commercial use have seen their origin in work performed for another purpose by the aerospace industry, and are in essence useful by-products of such work. The paper presents a number of commercialization projects and comments on the process of "technology transfer" for each of these. Transfer of these technologies into the commercial arena frequently requires a change in engineering philosophy, and a change in the management and business environment of the project. Some of the projects discussed now have an established commercial application, while others are still in the process of technical development or establishing the necessary business framework. Projects reviewed which effectively completed the "technology transfer" include a surface- tension system now successfully used for cleaning up marine oil spills, an oxygen diffuser system for high- efficiency biological waste water treatment, and the application of missile ground checkout technology for automatic checkout of airline equipment. A number of projects still awaiting completion of the technology transfer process are also reviewed, including an optical black surface with the lowest known visible and infrared reflectivity, a novel cryogenic insulation system, and a heliostat-boiler system for combined solar/conventional power plants. The paper emphasizes the methods used to create the proper business environment for successful technology transfer, and discusses some of the typical obstacles encountered. 740881. A Brief Look at Engine Installations for Future Naval Aircraft. R. M. Gaertner, Naval Air Systems Command. This paper discusses various engine installations in Naval aircraft, looking especially at their costs of maintenance. Fuel systems, fuel control systems, and several engine accessories are discussed for present and future engines. It is concluded that simple, reliable equipment is necessary to keep aircraft in the air instead of in maintenance areas on the ground. 740884. An Engine Project Engineer's View of Advanced Secondary Power Systems. W. L. Mclntire and S. M. Hudson, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Increasing secondary powerloads, advanced technology components, varied installations, and increased emphasis on cost and performance provide the requirements against which the engine project engineer must seek a balance during the conceptual, design, and development phases of an engine program. This paper reviews the requirements for advanced engine secondary power systems and some of the trends which are developing for future propulsion systems. 148</page><page sequence="108">740885-740891 740885. F- 15 Secondary Power Systems. Harold S. Ostroff, McDonnell Aircraft Co. This paper discusses features of the F-15 (fighter aircraft) secondary power systems which represent state-of-the-art advances, and the design considerations that led to their selection. The significant influence on the overall vehicle configuration that their utilization created includes con- tributions to reduce frontal area, lighter weight, less maintenance, lower cost, and improved vehicle surviv- ability. 740886. B-l Secondary Power Subsystem. B. J. Covey, Rockwell International Corp. The B-l secondary power subsystem is described and an overview of interfacing subsystems is given. The systems are designed to provide a high degree of air vehicle self-sufficiency and rapid deployment capability. Systems integration for minimum weight and volume is empha- sized. Each of the airframe-mounted accessory drive gear- boxes may be shaft-driven by either the related propulsion engine or an auxiliary power unit (APU). Stored hydraulic energy is used for APU starting. The engines are started with APU power transmitted through fill-and-drain torque converters in the accessory drive gearboxes. An acceleration limiting device is employed for coupling the gearbox accessory drive train to the APU. System control is highly automated. Ground test experience to date has shown system functional operation and performance to be in con- formance with design expectations. All vehicle flight tests are imminent. 1974 SA E Transactions 740887. The PHM Hydrofoil Automatic Control System. Donald R. Stark, Naval Systems Division, Boeing Aerospace Co. A new NATO patrol hydrofoil missile (PHM) is being developed, with the first lead ship nearing completion. The automatic control system (ACS), which provides the foilborne vehicle control, is newly developed for PHM. The ACS development evolved primarily from two previous hydrofoil control systems: Tucumcari and High Point. The ACS functional configuration was evolved using a highly developed digital simulation of the craft, control hardware, and sea conditions. Extensive failure mode and effect analyses were used to evolve a ship/control system configuration which is fail-safe for single-level failures within the system. From the overall performance, stability, and failure analyses, significant evolutions in the control system configurations resulted. The ACS hardware is newly developed for PHM, building around new families of integrated circuit building blocks. A companion to the ACS is the self-test system, which provides verification that the total ACS is operating properly, and provides fault isolation to the shipboard replaceable unit in the event of a failure. 740888. Navy Advanced Flight Control Actuation Sys- tems. J. N. Demarchi and C. E. Knox, Columbus Aircraft Div., Rockwell International Corp. This paper describes a program directed toward estab- lishing the feasibility of a new and innovative Flight Control Actuation System concept. This concept is based on the utilization of a fly-by-wire, direct, electrically controlled surface actuator which accepts computer signals. Standardized modules are used to provide alter- nate actuator configurations and power classes. The concept is in accordance with MIL-F- 18372 which states that "Flight control systems should be as simple, direct, and foolproof as possible, with respect to design, opera- tion, inspection, and maintenance." 740889. Simulator and Flight Tests of a Side Force Control System in the A-9A Airplane. W. G. Wheldon, Aircraft Div., Northrop Corp. A new control system, Side Force Control (SFC), has been developed to give aircraft a bombing and strafing accuracy unobtainable with conventional aileron control techniques. Large gains in accuracy through SFC have been detected through moving-base simulator tests of weapon delivery. "Iron sight" accuracy has also increased with SFC. SFC involves making aiming corrections in azimuth by turning with wings level. It eliminates the need (of conventional aileron control) for rolling prior to weapon release. Though the SFC turn rate is insufficient for the major maneuvers of initial roll-in from level flight or gross roll-out at diving altitude, it is more than sufficient for small heading change needs of the last seconds before release. 740890. Manual and Automatic Flight Control During Severe Turbulence Penetration. Donald E. Johnston and Richard H. Klein, Systems Tech- nology, Inc. In this paper, updated pilot/display/aircraft analysis techniques are applied to the problem of turbulence upset. In the course of an investigation of standard operating procedures and current autopilot turbulence modes, it was found that an improved turbulence penetration system is needed. A simulation was conducted to evaluate the turbulence autopilot and flight director concepts. It was found that an energy management system comprising the integrated autopilot and thrust director provided the greatest decrease in pilot work load and improvement in performance. 740891. Airline Tow Tractor - Baggage/Cargo Factors for Design Consideration. Morton C. Epstein, East- ern Air Lines, Inc. Various factors considered in the evaluation of towing requirements of airline baggage/cargo tow tractors are described. The design factors include characteristics of the towed load, the airport's environment, and general 149</page><page sequence="109">740891-740925 characteristics and requirements of the tow vehicle. In discussing design data, mathematical formulas are presented for the calculation of tractive effort, drawbar pull, gross vehicle weight, engine torque, engine brake horsepower, and braking capacity. An example of deter- mining specifications for a tractor under particular service conditions is also included. 740921. Shuttle Orbiter Atmospheric Revitalization Sys- tem and Freon Coolant Loop System Trade Studies. Raymond B. Trusch, Hamilton Stan- dard Div., United Aircraft Corp. Design and development phases of both the atmosphere revitalization system (ARS) and the Freon coolant loop (FCL) equipment for the space shuttle orbiter are preceded by a requirements definition phase. This phase provides assurance that a reliable, minimum weight and cost-effective system which will meet the needs of the orbiter vehicle and crew will be built. The paper describes key tasks and accomplishments of the Orbiter ARS and FCL requirements definition phase. Systems approaches used to accommodate the heat loads placed on these subsystems by the vehicle and its payloads, including the European Space Laboratory, are discussed. Total equivalent weight trade studies and preliminary designs conducted lead to the establishment of firm requirements for the detailed design phase. 740922. Space Shuttle Food Galley Design Concept. N. D. Heidelbaugh and M. Smith, Johnson Space Center, NASA; R. Fischer, The Pillsbury Co.; and B. Cooper, Fairchild Republic Co. A food galley has been designed for the crew com- partment of the NASA space shuttle orbiter. The rationale for the definition of this design was based upon assign- ment of priorities to each functional element of the total food system. Principle priority categories were assigned in the following order: food quality, nutrition, food pack- aging, menu acceptance, meal preparation efficiency, total system weight, total system volume, and total power requirements. Hence, the galley was designed using an "inside-out" approach which first considered the food and related biological functions and subsequently proceeded "outward" from the food to encompass supporting hardware. The resulting galley is an optimal design incorporating appropriate priorities for tradeoffs between biological and engineering constraints. This design approach is offered as a model for the design of life support systems. 740923. Maintainability and Maintenance Approach to Orbiter ECLSS Design. T. H. Linsday, Jr., Rockwell International. On the Shuttle Program, a great deal of effort is being expended toward the end of having a reuseable flight system with a minimum of expenditure of development dollars. Because much of the hardware which is presently both space and man rated has achieved that status on programs with nonreuseable hardware, there are signif- icant challenges to achieving a balance between devel- opment and production costs and those costs associated with supporting the deployed system. The maintainability analysis processes are described, as well as the various figures of merit associated with this support system and the maintenance characteristics of the flight and ground hardware. The interplay between hardware maintenance analysis and the derived design requirements, for both the flight and ground hardware, and described. A distinct relationship will be developed between the packaging and installation design approaches and the instrumentation and associated data system interface. These concepts, approaches and methods are exemplified using the current orbiter environmental control and life support system as the sample for application of the identified processes. The specifics of the application deal primarily with installation location, LRU definition and the fault recognition, and isolation mechanisms. In addition, the off-vehicle con- siderations are explored, since the maintenance of repa- rable spares has such great potential leverage on life-cycle and per flight costs. 740924. Membrane Ultrafiltration to Treat Laundry Wastes and Shower Wastes for Water Reuse. Robert B. Grieves, Dibakar Bhattacharyya and J. W. Paul, The University of Kentucky. Membrane ultrafiltration is a pressure-activated process and is generally carried out at low transmembrane pressure differences of 105 to 106 N/m2. The solute rejection characteristics of a membrane depend on the pore size distribution, on the nature of the membrane (charged or uncharged), and on membrane-solute inter- action. Ultrafiltration has been used for the separation of low molecular weight ionic solutes (with charged mem- branes), modest molecular weight (size) organic solutes, organic macromolecules, and colloids from aqueous solution. In systems designed for water reuse and in applications in which very high solute rejection (&gt; 0.9) is not warranted, membrane ultrafiltration is a very prom- ising technique. An extensive experimental investigation is presented of the continuous flow, membrane ultrafiltration of laundry wastes (containing linear alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant or linear alcohol ethoxylate nonionic surfactant, and shower wastes. The study, which is described in detail, indicates economic feasibility of membrane ultrafiltration of laundry wastes and shower wastes for water recovery and reuse systems. 740925. Removal of Toxic Compounds by Reverse Os- mosis. Edward S. K. Chian and Herbert H. P. Fang, University of Illinois. The removal of over 40 toxic compounds, including heavy metals, synthetic pesticides and organic compounds, by cellulose acetate (CA) and crosslinked-polyethylenimine (C-PEI) membranes were examined. With few exceptions both membranes removed 97+ percent of the heavy metals 150</page><page sequence="110">740925-740931 and pesticides tested; the C-PEI membrane was found to be somewhat more effective than the CA membrane. In addition, the C-PEI membrane removed 70+ percent of 13 of the 19 organic compounds tested; only two compounds were removed less than 50 percent. In contrast, however, the CA membrane removed less than 50 percent of 16 of the 19 organic compounds tested, and three compounds were found to exhibit negative removal. The ability of C-PEI membrane to remove organic compounds and its resistance to high temperature and pH have made reverse osmosis an effective separation process for the removal of toxic compounds from water. 740927. UV-Ozone Water Oxification-Sterilization Pro- cess. Jack D. Zeff, Richard Barton and LeRoy H. Reuter, Inca-One Corp. This paper summarizes a study of combining ultraviolet radiation and ozone to purify water contaminated with microorganisms and organic compounds. The objectives of the study were to determine the feasibility of the combination of ultraviolet light and ozone to sterilize and to remove organics from water, to define the concentrations of ultraviolet light and ozone required to remove predetermined levels of microbial contamination and organic substances from water, and to describe operating parameters for water sterilization and purification that can be used as a basis for designing operating systems that can be used by the Army and in manned space flight. The study to date has found that the combination of UV and ozone is more effective in destroying test organisms than UV alone. About 2.25 ppm ozone plus UV will destroy about 99.7% of the organisms present and 3 ppm of ozone plus UV will result in complete destruction of the organisms. The process was found to partially oxidize 10 mg/1 hydroquinone, xylenol, and pyrogallol in water. The best result to date was the 94% oxidation of xylenol using 0.17 ml/1 03 in air at a flow rate of 7.5 1/min over a 1 h period. Work is continuing to define the most economical operating conditions needed to obtain maximum oxida- tion of the test organics. 740928. Efficiency Evaluation of a Treatment System for the Reuse of Field Hospital Wastewater. C. Scott Clark, Robert D. Lingg, Edward Pesci and Edward J. Cleary, Department of Environmen- tal Health. This paper describes a program for the utilization of a bench scale water reuse plant and analytical chemical capability to test for the potability of recycled hospital waste water. Such waste water is made up of wastes from the kitchen, shower, laboratory, x-ray, and operating room; and is composed of nontoxic, toxic, and suspected toxic chemicals. The overall strategy of the work involved developing various treated fractions of the waste water, chemically characterizing them, and supplying them to others for toxicity evaluation. The bench-scale reuse system and chemical analysis have proved useful in the development of a test for potability of hospital reuse waters. The procedure of division of the components of the total waste water before treatment and physical-chemical fractionation after treat- ment facilitates the toxicity evaluation. Feedback of toxicity test results from these subdivisions of the total waste aids in the identification of toxic components, and in the development of specific tests for them. 740929. Spacecraft Applications of Electrochemical Pro- cesses. Barbara M. Greenough, Lockheed Mis- siles &amp; Space Co., Inc. Mechanical and electrical systems are well-known and widely used for environmental control. Thermostatically controlled air conditioning is a common terrestrial example. In space and undersea situations, constraints such as remoteness (limited or zero resupply), lack of gravity, and a hostile exterior atmosphere provide a challenge to environmental control technology. In par- ticular, the development of environmental systems for future long-duration manned space missions is leading to new and sophisticated applications of chemical and electrochemical processes to augment the basic mechan- ical/electrical systems. This paper highlights the role of electrochemical processes in spacecraft environmental systems develop- ment and, by example, describes the fundamentals of these processes. In overview, oxygen recovery, carbon dioxide removal, two-gas pressure and composition control, water and waste management, and night orbit power supply are shown to be functions which can be at least partially performed with electrochemical processes. Oxygen and nitrogen generation by the electrolysis of water and hydrazine, and electrolytic treatment of urine are described as example processes. 740930. Modeling of Absorbent and Oxygen Supply Systems for Spacecraft. Sam H. Davis, Jr., Department of Chemical Engineering, Rice University. 740931. Environmental Carbon Dioxide Control. Michael Onischak, Bernard Baker and Dimitri Gida- spow, Energy Research Corp. A study of environmental carbon dioxide control for NASA EVA missions found solid potassium carbonate to be an effective regenerable absorbent in maintaining low carbon dioxide levels. The supported sorbent was capable of repeated regeneration below 150°C without appreciable degradation. Optimum structures in the form of thin pliable sheets of carbonate, inert support and binder were developed. Interpretation of a new solid-gas pore closing model helped predict the optimum sorbent and analysis of individual sorbent sheet performance in a thin rectangular channel sorber can predict packed bed performance. 151</page><page sequence="111">740932-740938 740932. An Electrochemical Device for Carbon Dioxide Concentration-System Design, Performance, and Steady State Analysis. C. H. Lin, Lockheed Electronics Co., Inc.; and Jack Winnick, Uni- versity of Missouri, Columbia. A system comprised mainly of 90 electrochemical cells has been designed for use as a C02 concentrator in a manned spacecraft. Cabin air, with a C02 partial pressure of about 3 mm Hg is passed across the cathode of an oxygen- hydrogen fuel cell. It is concentrated through the carbonate electrolyte and expelled into the hydrogen-filled anode cavity. The total system, as well as the individual cell design, is described. Experimental results are shown for the full (90 cell) system and also for smaller scale (1 and 3 cell) tests. Excellent consistency among the tests was found. A steady-state analytical model has been developed and numerical simulations of the system have been carried out. The combined model has been used to compute the detailed concentration distributions in the bulk electro- lyte. These results are used to predict incidence of precipitation in the electrolyte as well as to calculate the pH. This capability is then utilized to confirm the adequacy of the control techniques used in the con- centrator operation. 740933. A Study of the Sebatier-Methanation Reaction. C. E. Verostko, Johnson Space Center, NASA; and R. K. Forsythe, Broome Community Col- lege. The kinetics of the Sabatier methanation reaction, the reduction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen to methane and water, was investigated for 58% nickel on kieselguhr catalyst and 20% ruthenium on alumina catalyst. Differ- ential rate data from an experimental program were correlated with a power function rate equation both for forward and reverse reactions. The kinetic parameters of activation energy, frequency rate constant and reaction order were determined for the rate equation. The values of these parameters were obtained from an Arrhenius plot of the experimental differential rate data. Also the carbon monoxide side reaction effect was measured and included in the correlation of parameters. The reaction was found to fit the rate equation exper- imentally within the temperature range 421 K, where the reaction effectively begins, to 800 K where the reaction rate drops and departs from the rate equation form. The paper discusses the experimental and analysis methods and describes how the reaction proceeds in a large reactor by use of the kinetic analyses results obtained in this study. 740935. A Real World Perspective on Automobile Acci- dents Involving Small-Child Passengers. Ray M. Shortridge and James O'Day, Highway Safety Research Institute, div., Univ. of Michigan. The purpose of this study was to obtain information useful for improving crash protection for small children. Previous research efforts have produced findings relating to accident characteristics in general, and those findings have been used to improve passenger protection. How- ever, little work has focused on the particular charac- teristics of nonfatal and fatal accidents involving small- child passengers. Thus, this study compared accidents involving small children (five years old and younger) with accidents not involving small children, to establish the similarities and differences between those types of accidents. The principal findings of the study are briefly summarized in the following description of a composite accident in which a small child is an occupant of the car: The child is very likely a passenger in a car driven by a female between 20 and 35 years of age, who is not wearing a seat belt, and who has not been drinking. The accident, likely a frontal impact collision, occurs in daylight, most likely on a Friday. If the child is fatally injured, there is a substantial (about a 13%) chance that the collision involves non-horizontal impact forces, including a greater chance of rollover than for other fatal-accident-involved cars. 740936. Basic Design Principles of Child Auto Restraints. J. W. Melvin and R. L. Stalnaker, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. This paper presents the anatomical considerations and general principles of occupant restraint in the car crash environment with emphasis on the protection of the child auto occupant. Design criteria and typical performance problem areas in child restraint systems are discussed. 740937. Development of Anthropomorphic Child Dum- mies. R. L. Rubenstein, Alderson Research Laboratories, Inc. In late 1971, Alderson Research Laboratories initiated the development of a totally new design for a similar pair of crash-test dummies in the three-year-old and six-year-old child sizes. The fundamental basis for this design was a compilation of recent child anthropometry surveys which served to define overall body weights and to target key external dimensions. Models built to conform to these targets were used to derive standards empirically for weight distribution and segment centers of gravity. These data are presented along with a description of the mechanics by which the sculptor's art, the anatomist's knowledge, and the machine designer's skills were blended to effect the transformation into the final human simu- lation models. 740938. Development of a Spindle Force-Moment Trans- ducer. George Z. Libertiny, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn Proving Ground; and Jerome Catz, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Miami (Florida). This paper describes a recently developed vehicle spindle 152</page><page sequence="112">740938-740946 transducer that is capable of measuring the three com- ponents of the force vector and the two components of the moment vector that simultaneously act on a spindle. The transducer dimensions are 4 X 4 X 1% in (105 X 105 X 32 mm) and weighs approximately 3 lb (13. 5N). It is durable and can measure with less than 4% total error. The spindle transducer fits existing suspension systems without significantly affecting vehicle geometry or dy- namic response and is, therefore, the only known spindle transducer that meets all requirements for size, weight, accuracy, and strength. 740939. Field Data Acquisition, Reduction, Life Predic- tion, and Field Service Correlation. D. R. Hart- degen, International Harvester Co. This paper discusses the overall concept and philosophy of field data acquisition and evaluation, incorporating results from an industrial tractor component. Since the scope of the subject is so large, the major p,art of the discussion is centered on the method of analyzing the data and life prediction. Some methods may or may not conflict with current procedures, and are presented as only one method of evaluation. 740940. Unattended Field Measurement Instrumentation. Milton Baker, General Motors Corp.

John R. Peterson, General Motors Proving Ground. Methods are discussed for obtaining in-service loads, motions, and operational parameters on customer-op- erated vehicles. Special load measuring transducers and unique unattended monitor recorders were utilized. Some statistics associated with selection of field customers are discussed. 1974 SA E Transactions 740942. Vehicle Test Development from Field Data. Edwin C. Sage, General Motors Corp. This paper deals with the overall program of vehicle field data collection and instrumentation. In it, the philosophy of the vehicle durability test is discussed relative to the requirement of accurately duplicating customer usage. Advantages and disadvantages of various data collection methods are also discussed. A brief, nonrigorous discus- sion of data analysis is included. 740943. Testing Vehicles and Components with Servo- hydraulic Load Units. Jürgen Telschow, Volks- wagenwerk AG. A servohydraulic test center for the automobile industry is described in this paper. Mechanical, hydraulic, and electronic modular components are assembled for all- purpose test facilities. The fundamental structure of a controlled system with a cylinder-servovalve combination is explained. Some measurements and the quality of the reproducibility of the simulation of random loads en- countered in road testing are discussed for two special test stands for axles and driveshafts. 740944. A Laboratory Fatigue Test Program for Steering Components Based on Field Load Data. Thomas S. Chelsky, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., General Motors Corp. More meaningful laboratory testing can be achieved from test programs designed to better simulate the usage of the component or system in the hands of the consumer. Steering gears and linkages are adaptable to force measurement during vehicle operation. This data can then be used to program laboratory test equipment in a manner which simulates the force environment encountered in vehicle usage. 740945. A Technique for the Validation of Vehicle Models Using the Road Simulator. James W. Grant, U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. One of the more important aspects of vehicle design is mechanical mobility. This term is a measure of how fast a vehicle can get from point A to point B without breaking while preserving the cargo and driver comfort. The road simulator has been used extensively as a laboratory tool to determine the durability aspect of the mechanical mobility problem. The objective of this paper is to show how the road simulator is used to provide the engineer with a validated mathematical model which he can then use to perform a parametric study to improve ride comfort. Specific areas of discussion are: mathematical model verification; correlation of model and simulator data; parameter adjustment to obtain improved ride. As a result of this study, the design engineer has a more precise vehicle model than has been available, and the test engineer has a verified laboratory simulation technique for vertical dynamic terrain inputs. The com- bined effect of these two engineering tools will serve to produce a better vehicle initially which, in turn, will eliminate many of the initial field test failures. 740946. Overview of Advanced Road Simulation Tech- niques. K. D. Zell, MTS Systems Corp. Many techniques are currently being used for different types of road simulation studies. These approaches vary from using a road simulator as an analysis tool for fatigue to durability simulation to predict the life of a complete vehicle in the laboratory. Different inputs to vehicles have been used, from the apparent straightforward approach of vertical inputs through the tire to complete simulation of combined loads through multiple inputs into the vehicle. 153</page><page sequence="113">740946-740951 An overview of these techniques developed over the past decade is presented. The analysis relates to the techniques and application of test equipment and methods of testing rather than the prediction or classification of actual results. 740947. An Utilitarian Approach to Mixing Phenomena. R. F. Hurt, Bradley Univ., C. C. Meek, Argonne National Lab.; and W. L. Hull, Univ. of Illinois. The intent of this study is to present effectual metho- dologies concerning single-phase and two-phase mixing problems which may conveniently be utilized by a design or developmental engineer. In particular, for single phase, turbulent, compressible coaxial fuel and air mixing problems, an index is presented which provides a sensitive indicator for determination of the degree of mixing in a given mixing chamber. Working graphs for several hydrocarbon fuel and air stream combinations are used to demonstrate the utility of the index. In addition, the index is shown to be of value for studying two-phase mixing such as occurring in automotive carburetors. This paper further demonstrates the utility of the hydraulic analogy for studying complex mixing problems such as commonly occurring in automotive carburetors and manifolds, gas turbine combustors, and simple mixing chambers. Use of the hydraulic analogy technique is shown to be a fast, inexpensive method which provides a pictorial representation of flow fields. Interpretation of the flow field stream line patterns brings about an improved understanding of conditions producing pressure drops, local flow field instabilities which are possible points of noise generation, improved flow field guidance through effective use of bounding walls or deflectors, and/or of conditions affecting local heat transfer rates. 740948. Photographic and Performance Studies of Diesel Combustion With a Rapid Compression Machine. Joe Rife and John B. Heywood, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Photographic and performance studies with a Rapid Compression Machine at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been used to develop insight into the role of mixing in diesel engine combustion. Combustion photographs and performance data were analyzed. The experiments simulate a single fuel spray in an open chamber diesel engine with direct injection. The effects of droplet formation and evaporation on mixing are exam- ined. It is concluded that mixing is controlled by the rate of entrainment of air by the fuel spray rather than the dynamics of single droplets. Experimental data on the geometry of a jet in a quiescent combustion chamber were compared with a two-phase jet model; a jet model based on empirical turbulent entrainment coefficients was developed to predict the motion of a fuel jet in a combustion chamber with swirl. Good agreement between theory and experiment was obtained. The fuel and air mixing rate was estimated from the jet models and compared with combustion rates measured in the Rapid Compression Machine.

Ashley Better fluid mixing in automobile engines can contribute to fuel economy, smoothness of engine operation, and reduction of emissions. It is possible to improve the uniformity of mixture of fuel with air in the induction system, of trapped burned gas with the charge in the cylinders, and of air with the exhaust gas in a reactor. Criteria of uniformity of mixing are discussed and a more stringent criterion suggested. The mixing length concept is developed. Fluid flow mixing models for different passage geometries are presented and evaluated for mixing length. Mixing performance of the induction system and cylinders of a typical engine are estimated. Improved mixing means are proposed and described. Maximum uniformity of distribution of the charge involves effective vaporization of fuel and mixing with the air ahead of the intake manifold. Maximum uniformity of mixture and turbulence prior to combustion involves the mixture of the trapped burned gas with the charge in the cylinders. 740950. Analysis on the Improvement of Vibration and Acoustic Characteristics of Automobiles. Akio Yoshida, Yasuro Suzuki and Yasuo Suzuki, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). The transfer functions of a vehicle's dynamic systems, which denote the exciting force characteristics of drive- line, vibration transmissibility of body structures and the characteristics of acoustic radiation from vehicle floors, are determined by forced vibration experiments. These three transfer functions are combined together into one, and frequency response characteristics of the vehicle's dynamic systems, composed of vibration and acoustic elements, are obtained by computer simulation tech- niques. By application of this approach, the relationship between the sound pressure in the passenger compartment and the dynamic parameters of vehicle components is investigated and the technical criteria for improvement of vibration/acoustic characteristics are clarified. 1974 SA E Transactions 740951. The Use of a Logic Electronic Device for Detection and Evaluation of Mechanical Defects of Vehicle Gearboxes in the Inspection Room. C. P. Galotto, C. Giorcelli, G. Levizzari and G.

Through analysis of the noise coming from the gear housing, this device can detect gear defects like nicks, eccentricities, and noisiness. It has proved reliable and not sensitive to external environ- mental condition changes. 154</page><page sequence="114">740952-740957 740952. Vibration Modes of an Automobile Driveline. D. Hodgetts and D. W. Parkins, Cranfield Institute of Technology, School of Automotive Studies (England). A theoretical and experimental study of the vibrations of the conventional driveline of a car with a rear-wheel drive has identified at least 1 1 modes of vibration in the range 10-200 Hz. There are indications that a simple theoretical model, which ignores coupling with the vibration modes of the body, is adequate to predict the most important modes. It is found that the model can be improved by the inclusion of the dynamic characteristics of the rubber insulators in the system and the gyroscopic effects of the rotating wheel. A significant increase of the noise level in the interior of the vehicle was attributed to the first bending mode of the rear axle. Random excitation by force inputs at the road surface, and forces and couples at twice the frequency of rotation of the driveshaft and engine crankshaft, cause the major resonance. When the noise cannot be attenuated by attention to the rear axle design or the path of the vibration, then recourse to a simple absorber or detuner may be necessary. 1974 SAE Transactions 740953. Methods for Producing High-Strength, Cold- Rolled Steel Sheet. P. R. Mould, U.S. Steel Corp. The growing emphasis on reducing automobile weight is likely to lead to the use of increasing quantities of high-strength, cold-rolled steel sheet in the near future. The reasons for this probable trend (such as production restrictions on producing hot-rolled sheets having thick- nesses below 0.070 in and potential weight savings from thinner body panels) are reviewed briefly. Because many steel producers are developing new steels and practices to expand their range of high-strength, cold-rolled sheet grades, the technical approaches avail- able for producing high strengths in cold-rolled steel sheets are also reviewed. Possible methods for increasing the strength of steel sheets are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of various strengthening methods are discussed briefly from the viewpoint of the steel producer, who must consider the facilities and practices required for production, and from the viewpoint of the user, who expects the steel sheets to have specific engineering properties. 1974 SAE Transactions 740954. Properties and Applications of High Strength Cold-Rolled Steels; Plain Carbon and Killed Low Alloy. Peter B. Lake and John J. Grenawalt, Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. Four families of low-carbon, high-strength cold-rolled (HSCR) sheet are discussed, exhibiting minimum yield strengths of 40 to 140 ksi. The relative merits of the various grades are analyzed in terms of important fabricating and selection criteria: strengthening capabil- ity, planar anisotropy, formability, impact loading re- sponse, weldability and cost reduction. Paralleling the increase in strengthening capability in HSCR was an increased planar anisotropy and variation in formability within the various families. The impact loading of all cold-rolled grades showed increased yield strengths and energy absorption; the weldability of the different grades varied widely depending upon strengthening mechanism, strength level, and chemistry; the cost reductions possible with the HSCR decreased as the degree of formability required in the finished part increased. Generally, gauge reductions of 6% to 34% were found to be necessary to offset cost extras for different grades of HSCR sheet. Continued work towards development of a full range of HSCR sheet with varying degrees of formability and cost appears necessary in light of the present and future expected needs of the steel buyer and designer. 1974 SAE Transactions 740955. A Formable-Strengthenable Sheet Steel. Rollin E. Hook, Research Center, Armco Steel Corp. High-strength cold-rolled sheet steels offer a potential to accomplish weight savings through gage reductions. However, the reduced formability which accompanies increased strength presents difficulties in the application of these steels for sheet metal stampings which require the formability equivalent of deep-drawing steels. A new deep-drawing sheet steel is being developed which overcomes the formability limitations of high-strength cold-rolled sheets. Parts made from this steel can be uniformly strengthened to a high yield strength, up to 120,000 psi (827 MPa). Strengthening is accomplished by a 1200°F (921 °K) heat treatment in a controlled atmos- phere which results in internal nitridation. The nitrides formed by the alloying elements in the steel provide precipitation hardening. No distortion of the parts results from the heat treatment. The effect of heat-treating variables on tensile properties, weldability, fatigue, and toughness, are discussed. 1974 SAE Transactions 740957. Columbium and Vanadium-Nitrogen High Strength Cold-Rolled Steels. C. R. Rarey and J. F. Butler, Graham Research Lab., Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp. High-strength cold-rolled steels that are both formable and weldable can be produced based on either the columbium or vanadium-nitrogen strengthening systems. The critical aspects of chemistry and processing were determined for these steels in a laboratory program, and the results were used in planning a mill trial. It was found that a high-strength, formable product was favored by factors that produced a high hot band yield strength, large amounts of cold reduction, and annealing at low tem- peratures just into the range where full recrystallization occurs. In the mill trial, 80,000-90,000 psi yield strength hot bands, relatively high cold reductions (50 and 65%), and 155</page><page sequence="115">740957-740965 controlled batch annealing between 11 80- 1225° F were used to produce 60,000 psi minimum yield strength fully recrystallized product. Very good property uniformity was achieved in the 0.042 in and 0.050 in thick product with longitudinal yield strengths averaging 63,300 psi with a standard deviation of 1880 psi. The formability of these steels generally matched that of high-strength hot-rolled steels of equivalent strength. It was also determined that sulfide inclusion shape control will be necessary to achieve the full formability potential of these steels. 740958. Present Status of Cold-Rolled High Strength Steel Development. George J. Klems and J. Malcolm Gray, Molycorp, Inc. Interest in the use of high strength cold-rolled steel sheets is growing primarily because of the greater weight reduction that can be realized in automotive vehicles when the thinner gage, higher strength cold-rolled sheets are substituted for the heavier gage hot or cold rolled sheets currently used. Today's steelmakers have considered and tried a number of metallurgical alternatives and philosophies which have resulted in the production and availability, either in commercial or developmental quantities, of formable, high-strength, cold-rolled steels with yield strengths in the range of 50 to 120 ksi. These steels have as good or better properties as the standard, lower strength, cold-rolled steels. 740960. An Automotive Gas Generator. John Hoar, McMaster University, Canada. The complete design of a system to generate carbon monoxide gas to run a 350 cm3 automobile engine is presented. The horsepower output using CO, and the amount of gas required to produce this horsepower, is determined. The gas generator including heat resistant materials, filtering and cooling system, carburetor, hopper, feeder and gas storage system are designed in detail. The start-up system and procedure is described. 740961. Drivers' Vision and Performance with Convex Exterior Rearview Mirrors. Rudolf G. Mortimer and Craig M. Jorgeson, Highway Safety Re- search Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. A laboratory simulation of dawn/dusk illumination showed that following vehicles could be detected equally well in plane and convex mirrors, and a night driving test showed that low- and mid-beam headlamps of a following car produced discomfort glare responses that were independent of whether the exterior mirror was plane or convex. Visibility of the following car was rated better with the plane exterior mirror. Measures of performance of drivers relevant to safety in lane changing and passing were not different when they used a plane or convex exterior mirror in conjunction with a plane interior mirror, and did not differ in the day or at night. When the initial speed of the overtaking car was 15 mph (24 km/h) greater than the subjects' car, drivers significantly underestimated the relative speed, indicating a potential cause of collisions with a following vehicle in lane changing and passing maneuvers. 740962. An Evaluation of Glare in Nighttime Driving Caused by Headlights Reflected from Rearview Mirrors. Norma D. Miller, Technology, Inc., Dwane Baumgardner, Donnelly Mirrors Inc.; and Rudolf G. Mortimer, Hwy. Safety Res. Inst., Univ. of Mich. This paper presents the results of a study directed toward examining the effects of glare resulting from following headlights reflected in rearview mirrors. In particular, the effects of different driving environments are discussed with regard to their effects on glare. The results of a computer analysis predicting the magnitude of glare reflected from rearview mirrors for several headlight systems are also presented. These computations cover a range of intercar spacings and both inside and outside mirrors. An important question is also posed concerning the effects of glare in a driver's peripheral field-of-view and its potential effects on the detection of early warning events. 740964. Mirror Sampling Characteristics of Drivers. R. R. Mourant, Industrial Engineering Department, Wayne State University; and R. J. Donohue, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corporation. Driver behavior in obtaining information through rear- view mirrors and head turns was analyzed for novice, young experienced, and mature drivers during daytime driving on a freeway route. No significantly different mirror sampling patterns were obtained when the hori- zontal fields of view of the plane left side and inside mirrors were expanded by approximately 25%. Some difference in behavior did occur between the mature and the other drivers, especially in mirror use when driving straight ahead. The total time to obtain information for left merges was significantly larger than for left and right lane changes and a right merge. Finally, the time required to obtain information to make a decision for a left or right lane change without execution was considerably less than the time needed when the maneuver was actually exe- cuted. 740965. Evaluation of Innovative Passenger Car and Truck Rear Vision System. William J. Burger, Dunlap and Associates. Twelve passenger and three truck rear vision systems were evaluated under real-world driving conditions using driver looking behavior as performance measures. Glance du- ration and frequency at each rear vision device, as well as glances made directly to the side/rear scene, by six experienced drivers during 22 traffic maneuvers were recorded using direct video recording of eye movements. 156</page><page sequence="116">740965-740970 Over 20,000 rear information gathering glances were analyzed with regard to glance location, frequency, duration, total glance time per maneuver, and number of glances per maneuver for each system. Superior rear vision systems were identified and design implications regarding multiple device systems, convex devices and field of view were drawn. Ground plot field of view maps and Docket 71 -3a target field of view coverage for each system was determined. A secondary study used expert judgment techniques to obtain estimates of rear scene zone criticality. Criticality weights of zones to the side and rear of passenger vehicles were derived. 740966. Dependence of Automotive Sound Levels on Vehicle-to-Microphone Distance. Ralph K. Hill- quist, Noise and Vibration Laboratory, General Motors Proving Ground. Several independent studies of sound level variation with nominal microphone distance are reported for a variety of equipment types tested in accordance with SAE exterior sound level test procedures. Good correlation between levels and distance is shown, although dependent on equipment type and mode of operation. It is concluded that predictions of sound levels at distances closer to the source than the normally-specified microphone distance can be made with reasonable accuracy. 1974 SAE Transactions 740967. The Influence of Test Site on Exterior Vehicle Noise Measurements. Narendra J. Sheth and P. Scott Gegesky, Ford Motor Co. As the compliance with noise legislation became more difficult, Ford exhaust system development engineers increasingly encountered variances not only from vehi- cle-to-vehicle, but on the same vehicle tested in different locations. As a result, a series of tests were conducted to establish the correlation among various sites for vehicle exterior noise measurements. The purpose of this paper is to present the results and the method developed to achieve the correlation in terms of the following: 1. Ford and site equipment differences 2. Driver differences 3. Differences between site physical qualities Seven sites were evaluated in the program where seven vehicles were used with a good spread in exterior noise levels. A representative correlation plot is also presented which can be used to predict the expected noise level of any vehicle at any one of these test sites knowing the level obtained at the Ford site. This paper also discusses the results of the analysis performed to determine the overall test repeatability for all sites, the test repeatability for each site and the repeatability of test equipment at various test sites. 1974 SAE Transactions 740968. A Study of Repeatability of Noise Measurements at Motor Vehicle Test Sites. John F. Hemdal, Environmental Research Institute of Michigan. The sound pressure level (SPL) measured at a given point varies as a motor vehicle goes through a pass-by noise test such as SAE J986a. The tests described in this paper were intended to assess the magnitude and variability of different motor vehicle noise measurements. All factors which might cause variation in the received SPL were either controlled or monitored. This study was designed to quantify the effects on SPL from wind turbulence. 1974 SAE Transactions 740969. Improvement of Automobile Fuel Economy. C. W. Coon and C. D. Wood, Southwest Research Institute. A series of road, engine, chassis dynamometer, and accessory power consumption tests was conducted in order to characterize the fuel economy of 1973 standard and intermediate size vehicles. Devices and systems which appeared to offer fuel economy benefits were evaluated by means of an analytical procedure. The study was limited to hardware which could be in production by the 1980 model year. The evaluation procedure was based on urban and steady speed operation, and the effects of compliance with future emission standards were included. Combinations of individual improvements were se- lected and applied to the same vehicle. The evaluation procedure was repeated, and fuel economy improvements of 30 to 70% were predicted by comparison with 1973 model year vehicles. 740970. Fuel Economy of the 1975 Models. Thomas C. Austin and Karl H. Hellman, Environmental Protection Agency. The fuel economy data obtained from the emission tests run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been used to show passenger car fuel economy trends from model year 1957 to present. This paper adds the 1975 model year to the historical trend and concen- trates on comparisons between the 1975 and 1974 models. Methodologies which allow different 1975 vs 1974 comparisons to be made have been developed. These calculation procedures allow the changes in fuel economy to be determined separately for emission control systems, new engine-vehicle combinations and model mix shifts. Comparisons have been calculated not only for the fleet as a whole but for each of the 13 manufacturers who were certified as of the time this paper was prepared. The net change in fuel economy for the fleet has been estimated at + 13.8% comparing the 1975 models to the 1974 models assuming no model mix change occurs. The majority of this change, 11.5%, is attributable to emission control system refinements and engine optimization. General Motors is responsible for the majority of the fleet average improvement due to the combination of their large market fraction (approximately 40%) and their 28% improvement due to engine/control system optimization made possible through the use of oxidation catalyst 157</page><page sequence="117">740970-740976 technology. The trend toward improved fuel economy which has been initiated by the 1975 models can continue in the future even with more stringent emission standards in effect, provided the achievement of good fuel economy remains a design constraint. Continuation of the trend may require the use of advanced hydrocarbon control systems which have not yet been fully developed. 740972. European Testing and Classification for Passen- ger Car Field Service Oils. A. Marciante, Fiat Central Research Laboratories on behalf of the CEC-Engine Lubricant Technical Committee. The European passenger car engine lubrication require- ments are not the same as the American requirements. The differences are determined by the engine design trends, the nature of fuels used and the type of service. The European engine and petroleum industries have undertaken the study of engine oil evaluation tests that meet European requirements. On the basis of the present standardized tests, engine manufacturers have recently proposed a specification for crankcase oils. This paper discusses particularly the European tests as to repeatability, reproducibility and correlation with service. Mention is also made of the recent European pro- posals for revision of the SAE Crankcase Oil Viscosity Classification. 1974 SAE Transactions 740973. High Temperature Lubrication Requirements of European Gasoline and Diesel Engines for Cars. R. Hollinghurst, Mobil Oil Co. Ltd. A CEC Investigation Group has examined temperatures in European gasoline engines. A survey showed top quartile average temperatures of 275° C (top ring groove), 147°C (sump) and 163° (cam/follower oil gallery and main bearing exit), under high speed driving conditions. Forecasts indicated sump temperatures would increase by 10-15°C, partly related to emissions control systems. Consequent problems were predicted as wear, scuffing, oil oxidation, ring sticking, high oil consumption, and bearing/seal distress. Development targets for lubricant high temperature performance tests are discussed, and the severities of a number of possible ring stick tests are compared. A similar CEC Survey concerned high-speed diesel engines. This covered both small passenger car, light van diesels, and larger truck diesels. Increasing ring and oil sump temperatures were identified. High temperature oil performance test needs for the smaller car diesel engine are discussed in the light of problems identified in the survey. 1974 SAE Transactions 740974. Prediction of Viscosity Stability of Multigrade Engine Oils in Service. A. A. Cassiani Ingoni and F. A. Vicenzetto, Petroleum Products Lab- oratory, SNAM PROGETTI S.p.A. (Italy). The viscosity change of multigrade motor oils in service has been evaluated in a fleet representative of the present European car population. The evaluation covered air- and water-cooled engines, with conventional and integral gearboxes, and displacements ranging from 500-1750 cc. The effect of car, service, average ambient temper- ature, and type of polymer on the viscosity change of a lubricant has been estimated. The multigrade test oils have also been run in injector and bench engine tests in order to compare field testing results with laboratory techniques being developed. 740975. European Low Temperature Viscosity Require- ments for Engine Oils, and Their Impact on SAE Classification Utilization. R. Hollinghurst, Mobil Oil Co., (England); and C. G. Nyström, A. B. Nynas Petroleum (Sweden). CEC investigation group IGL-8 has conducted a survey of European engine cold starting and oil viscosity require- ments. The group's objectives were to determine if the 20W bracket was too wide for European use and what alternatives existed for improving the matching of oilof European engine cold starting and oil viscosity require- ments. The group's objectives were to determine if the 20W bracket was too wide for European use and what alternatives existed for improving the matching of oil quality to manufacturer needs. A study of engine cranking speeds showed that the span of the 20W range is twice that of the 10W range for European cars. Car Cold Startability, and weather data analysis, also showed that the span covered by the 20W range was double that for the 10W range, and that a critical winter temperature for many more temperate countries was -10°C(14°F). For many cars, an oil in the 48-64 poise range at -18°C(0°F) would provide 95-97% confidence of starting in the coldest month-January-and would best match their needs. Some diesel starting data, particularly on small, high-speed engines appeared to show the same trends. Due to concern over high temperature operational problems, a number of European Car Manufacturers prefer mid-range 20W oils at the 45-64 poise level to 10W oils. Recognizing this, the CEC has suggested that the SAE may wish to consider establishment of an inter- mediate "15W" grade with 48 poise maximum at -18°C(0°F). A minority also suggested reduction of the 20W upper limit to 64 poise, but this received only limited support because of worldwide impact on existing satisfied users of "high" 20W oils. 1974 SAE Transactions 740976. Temporary Viscosity Loss of Engine Oils. G. F. Busetto, U. Giulio and E. Volpi, Central Re- search Labs., div., FIAT. A study on the temporary viscosity loss under high shear rates of engine lubricants was started in order to: 158</page><page sequence="118">740976-740986 1. Set up a new viscometer, more correlate with the engine than the present ones. 2. Clarify the influence of this phenomenon on the lubricant performances. Preliminary results on a pressoviscometer are dis- cussed. Namely it is underlined that the temporary viscosity loss affects both multigrade and unigrade oils, even if at different levels, and in different ways. 740978. Design and Test of Pickup Truck Box Cover. Irvin J. Leichtle, Automotive Products Div., Rockwell International. The problems of adding new assembly operations to already established assembly lines requires much planning and probably an expansion of facilities. New equipment must be installed and floor space increased to facilitate the new operation. This paper describes the improvements made on an assembly line to facilitate the production of a new line of fiberglass truck campers. 740979. Corvette Plastic Progress Enters Third Decade. R. A. Vogelei, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. This paper traces the more than 20-year history of fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) as the primary body material for the Chevrolet Corvette. Reasons for the original decision to use FRP are reviewed, followed by a discussion of the difficulties encountered in design, manufacturing techniques, and material compounding. These problems, and the solutions to them, include the progression from the original wet-mat material to low- profile systems. Sheet molded compounds (SMC) are discussed as non-low profile and low-profile applications. Unresolved production problems are outlined with a review of industry attention necessary to assure continued FRP application to Corvette body panels. This paper also discusses the design and application of flexible facias used on both front and rear-end bumper systems and the use of plastic as a bumper energy- managing system. 740982. The Effect of Sintering Temperature and Flow on the Properties of Ni-Mo Steel Hot P/M Formed Material. John P. Cook, Hoeganaes Corp. Water-atomized nickel-molybdenum alloy (0.5 Ni-0.5 Mo) powder was blended with graphite for 0.4% carbon, then pressed into preforms (1.5 X 2 X 5 in). The preforms were hot formed to full density via a variety of processing conditions (various degrees of flow, sintering temperature, and sintering atmosphere). Impact specimens were excised and tested over a range of temperatures to determine the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. All impact specimens had ductile failure at room temperature. In general, increased deformation increased the room-temperature and low-temperature impact strengths by eliminating particle boundaries and elon- gating the inclusions. High temperature sintering reduced the oxygen content and improved the impact strength by reducing the number of crack-initiating inclusions. Jominy hardenability test results were unaffected by various sintering conditions because the amount of easily oxidizable alloying elements was kept to a minimum. 1974 SA E Transactions 740983. Wear-Resistant P/M Parts in the As-Sintered Condition. R. H. Hoefs, A. O. Smith-Inland Inc. A few P/M fabricators currently are producing alloy parts which have high hardness in the as-sintered condition. These parts are intended for applications requiring high-wear resistance in service. The chemistries of the alloys used generally are proprietary. The objective of this paper is to describe for P/M fabricators and end users the metallurgical principles involved in designing the alloy chemistry to produce parts of this type; that is, the types and amounts of alloys are described which will suitably alter the phase transfor- mation. characteristics so that martensitic microstructures are produced during sintering. An understanding of these principles could lead to expanded usage of alloy wear- resistant P/M parts. 740984. Joining of P/M Structures. Walter V. Knopp, A. Johnson and Co., Inc. A comparison of standard methods of joining P/M structures, as well as new techniques. The porosity of a P/M part is no longer a problem when joining P/M to P/M or P/M to wrought. These joints will be as strong or stronger than the P/M material. The systems give the design engineer more flexibility. 740985. Automotive Bumper Cost Effectiveness Based on Field Data and Mathematical Modeling. R. R. Boltz, R. L. Grzesiak and E. J. Röhn, Ford Motor Company. The Ford Motor Company has developed a mathematical model utilizing electronic data processing techniques to calculate the potential savings to owners of automobiles equipped with energy absorbing bumpers. This model can be used to measure the economic effectiveness of alternative bumper performance requirements and/or system design proposals. Base data for the model has been obtained from surveys conducted by Ford of damage to pre-FMVSS 215 controlled vehicles. A description of the technique utilized to predict bumper system economic effectiveness and the results of Ford Motor Company's bumper cost-effectiveness studies are contained in this report. 740986. Bumpers: Effective, But How Cost Beneficial? James Casassa, II, Wayne W. Sorenson and Richard E. Gardner, State Farm Mutual Au- tomobile Insurance Company. The major factors influencing the cost-benefit relationship of improved bumper systems are discussed. Evidence is 159</page><page sequence="119">740986-740991 presented which demonstrates that energy-absorbing bumper designs have proved effective in reducing the frequency of crash damage, especially damage from low-speed crashes. Among the statistical sources utilized are State Farm's Current Model Year Study, Survey of Unrepaired Damage, Highway Loss Data Institute re- ports, and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash test results. Although the improved bumper systems are proving effective, the maximum potential cost savings are not yet being realized by consumers. This situation should change as standardization of bumper heights becomes more prevalent and as better data on the costs of improved bumper systems becomes available. 740987. Improved Bumpers - How Are They Doing? T. W. Ruster, Proving Ground Section, General Motors Corporation. The purpose of this study was to define the performance of 1973 vehicles (meeting the requirements of FMVSS 215) in terms of collision losses. The study addresses both unrepaired and repaired damage. In terms of overall dollars per car-year, the results fail to show a difference in losses between 1973 model year vehicles and 1971 model year vehicles. 740988. Costs, Benefits, Effectiveness and Safety: Setting the Record Straight. Brian O'Neill and A. B. Kelley, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The concepts of "cost-benefit" and "cost-effectiveness" are increasingly cropping up in debate over present and future motor vehicle standards. Often they are introduced to attack, or justify, a particular standard. Just as often, they are misunderstood and misused. Since a motor vehicle safety performance standard has no costs per se, it cannot be evaluated either in cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness terms. It is the particular design alternatives available to manufacturers to achieve the objectives of a standard that have societal costs. The various design alternatives can be evaluated. Cost-effective designs should be chosen to minimize societal costs, and until there is evidence that cost- effective designs have been chosen, cost-benefit studies are premature. Even then, because of the major conceptual and methodological difficulties in the valuation of life and limb, cost-benefit studies will be appropriate only in the evaluation of designs not primarily intended to save lives and reduce injuries - that is, vehicle designs to reduce property damage. Until manufacturers are forthcoming with accurate cost data, neither cost-effectiveness nor cost-benefit studies in this field can be relied upon. Pending legislation may resolve this. 740989. Occupant Safety and Damageability Considera- tions Related to the 1974 Automobile Bumpers. Michael R. Appleby, Automobile Club of South- ern California. This paper reports on research which examined the effectiveness of 1974 automobile bumpers in terms of occupant safety and automobile damageability. Static and dynamic tests were performed by attaching a height measuring device on the front and rear bumpers of 1974 domestic automobiles. The static test results showed effective bumper height match. The dynamic test results showed that 21% of bumpers could mismatch when the rear (colliding) vehicle is pitched due to braking and 77% of bumpers could mismatch when both vehicles are pitched due to braking. Occupant safety is discussed in terms of both the positive and negative effects of the new bumpers for all collision speeds. The effect on override/underride colli- sion frequency and passive restraint (air bag) system activation is examined. The tradeoffs of decreased frequency of damage to vehicles and increased costs to replace the new bumpers when they are damaged in high speed collisions are discussed. Conclusions are that any resultant gain in occupant safety as a result of the new bumpers is debatable and that there are no significant overall economic gains at this time. In addition, existing regulations that will become operative in the near future do not appear to provide an effective solution because of the multiplicity of factors which are involved. 740990. Dynamic Properties of "Viton" Fluoroelastomer Vulcanizates. A. E. Hirsch and R. H. Burd, I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. This paper presents an experimental study of the effect of air oven aging on the dynamic properties of "Viton" fluoroelastomer. These results are compared to other elastomers, where published formulations have been available. Some results on the fatigue characteristics of "Viton" are presented. Dynamic properties are presented for a range of typical "Viton" formulations. The data suggest that "Viton" is a material of choice for dynamic applications at elevated temperatures. 1974 SAE Transactions 740991. Dynamic Characteristics of an Elastomeric-Pneu- matic Isolator With Orifice-Type Relaxation Damping for Vehicular Suspension Applications. Dale W. Schubert and Romulus H. Racca, Barry Div. Barry Wright Corp. This paper presents the theoretical dynamic properties of an elastomeric-pneumatic isolator with orifice-type relax- ation damping. The elastomeric portions of the isolator serve to contain the pressurized air, contribute elastic stiffness, and act as a cushioning and motion-limiting "snubber" in cases where severe shock transient exci- tations exist. The pressurized air contained within the isolator serves to support the entire static load, contribute stiffness, and provide orifice-type relaxation damping. The resulting design concept results in a low profile, low natural frequency, and very stable isolator for shock and vibration isolation. 160</page><page sequence="120">740991-740997 The objective of the isolator design is to provide the maximum degree of vibration and shock attenuation of typical vehicle excitations to the vehicle operator at the frequencies where the human body is most sensitive to dynamic excitations. As a result of this fundamental objective, substantial vibration attenuation at the first mode of vibration of a seated human must be provided. This required the isolator resonant frequency to be at or below 2 cps. Examination of the dynamic environment present on typical truck and tractor cab mounting points showed considerable dynamic excitation in the proposed frequency region of the isolator resonance. Lowering the isolator resonance well below 2 cps would avoid this excitation, but at the tradeoff of very undesirably large isolator sizes, dynamic excursions, and low rocking mode frequencies. Therefore, the isolator fundamental reso- nance was maintained close to 2 cps and the coefficient of damping of the relaxation damping mechanism was optimized to provide minimum payload accelerations and maximum isolator damping in response to typical tran- sient excitation time histories present on the rear axles of a typical medium-sized agricultural tractor. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated by determining the improvement in operator comfort through the utilization of the response characteristics of simple mechanical oscillators attached to the isolated and unisolated excitation surfaces. The results show that the relaxation-damped elastomeric-pneumatic isolator con- cept provides large comfort effectiveness values for vehicle operators during typical vehicle operating con- ditions. 740992. The Effects of Heat and Stress on the Interface of Glass-Reinforced Polyimide Composites. D. J. Vaughan, Clark-Schwebel Fiber Glass Corp. With the development of the addition-type polyimide resins, a need arose for a coupling agent that would improve the performance of the fiber-resin interface under thermal stress. Research work was carried out to develop such a material and resulted in a new coupling agent for use at high temperatures. The test data generated from glass fiber reinforced composites using this new coupling agent, and the study of the interface using the scanning electron microscope, demonstrate an improvement in the cohesive and interfacial shear of the glass fiber-resin matrix. This development has provided the designer with a material that retains its structural integrity under extreme thermal conditions. 740993. Development of Polymeric Materials for Human- like Neck Simulations. Gregory A. Campbell, Edward M. Hagerman, Stanley A. lobst, William C. Meluch, Robert J. Salloum and Clyde C. Culver, Research Laboratories, Gen- eral Motors Corp. Several polymeric materials were developed and evaluated for possible inclusion in the neck structure of state- of-the-art anthropomorphic dummies. These included three types of foam-polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, and Polyurethane, and two flexible polymers-polyurethane and a Polyvinylchloride chlorinated polyethylene blend (PVC-CPE). Two materials, the polyurethane elastomer and the PVC-CPE blend, were found to be satisfactory in their dynamic response. Because of the ease of casting, the polyurethane material will be used in the GMR 1 state-of-the-art dummy. 1974 SA E Transactions 740994. Controls and Displays: Problems, Progress, and Priorities. Michael Perel, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Difficulties of measuring safety problems related to human factors aspects of vehicle controls and displays are discussed and illustrated with examples. A review of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-sponsored control/display research dealing with some of these problems is presented. The review describes the objectives, methodology, key findings, and application of the results of the research. Finally, future research needs are outlined. 740995. Identification of Symbols and its Influence on Training for Motor Vehicle Controls. Reinhard Lendholt, Research and Development, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Germany). Clear identification of motor vehicle controls is necessary for safe operation of a vehicle. Identification of some well-known symbols and some new symbols was inves- tigated by inquiries. Differences in identification between trained and untrained subjects are shown (employees of a vehicle manufacturer versus factory visitors). Influences of sex, age, and professional education are evaluated. The learning effect of identification before and after a purposeful training was investigated by an additional inquiry of factory visitors. The result showed no significant influence of sex, age, professional experience, or ownership of a driver license on the identification after training. This improves the chance of eliminating symbols of insufficient identifi- cation. 740996. Identification of Vehicle Instrument-Panel Con- trols. P. D. McCormack, Carleton University, (Canada). The purpose of the study was to determine which of three symbols would best represent each of 15 instrument-panel controls. The subjects were required to experience a "pretend" drive in an automobile simulator, the major element of which was a control panel containing the appropriate 15 symbols. For seven of the controls, one symbol was clearly the best of the three. For four of the controls, performance was optimal for all three symbols, while none of the symbols sufficed for the remaining four controls. 740997. The Influence of Size on the Recognition of 161</page><page sequence="121">740997-741003 Symbols for Motor Vehicle Controls. Gordon R. W. Simmonds, Ford of Britain. Drivers searched for known symbols on a simulation of a dimly lit (5 lx) instrument panel. The symbols, from 2 mm to 25 mm diameter, were in groups of nine. They were randomly selected from 24 used to identify controls and displays on European Ford vehicles. The probability of recognition was related to size for eight symbols. This gives a rational basis for the size used in vehicles. No reliable difference was found between the performance of black symbols on white backgrounds and white on black. Substantial differences exist between the effectiveness of different symbols. Recommendations for improvements were based on confusions between symbols. 1974 SA E Transactions 740998. Human Factors Evaluation of Headlight Switch- ing Systems. Lorna Middendorf, Patrick W. Dineen and Stefan Habsburg, General Motors Corp. A search for methods of switching a proposed three beam headlight system led to the evaluation of 41 possible schemes. Human factors criteria reduced the original 41 to three systems which were tested in a laboratory with a broad range of subjects. Recordings of practice trials, learning trials, and the responses to visual cues projected on a screen were analyzed. The same test procedure was also used to compare three alternative ways of switching conventional two beam headlight systems. Summary data is presented for the six systems tested grouped by test subject age, sex, and driving experience. The most pronounced difference observed was in the subjective preference rating among two beam switching systems. All systems tested resulted in remarkably few learning and practice trials. Small dif- ferences were recorded among systems in operational response time. 741000. Effects on Drivers' Response Times and Errors of Some Malfunctions in Automobile Rear Lighting Systems. Rudolf G. Mortimer and Patricia A. Domas, Highway Safety Res. Inst., div., Univ. of Michigan. Surveys of rear lighting system malfunctions on passenger cars and light trucks showed that about 4% of vehicles with single compartment rear lamps had an inoperative presence or stop/turn lamp, while less than 1% of vehicles with multiple compartment rear lamps had at least one operating presence lamp compartment working on each side, and about 2.5% had no stop/turn signal lamp compartments operating on one side. Thus, although the frequency of failure of bulbs or circuits was greater in rear lighting systems with multiple compartment than single compartment lamps, the likelihood that at least one presence or signal lamp compartment will be operating on each side of the vehicle is greater in lighting systems with multiple compartment lamps, by 2-3%. The effects of some rear lighting system malfunctions on the ability of drivers to identify signals was evaluated in two experiments using a driving simulator. Six rear lighting systems using combined function, separate func- tion, signal lamp redundancy, and color coding were compared in normal and malfunctioning operating con- ditions. It was concluded that the use of signal lamp redun- dancy offers only a minor benefit in terms of driver performance. In other respects, those rear lighting systems employing separation of function provided better per- formance of drivers. One system using stop signal lamp redundancy and separation of function provided effective detection of stop signals. The most effective systems used color coding and functional separation of signal lamps. It was suggested that vehicles with multiple compartment signal lamps employ variable-load flashers. However, communication of braking and turning can best be accomplished by functional separation and color coding in vehicle rear signaling systems. 1974 SA E Transactions 741001. Driver Adaptability and Acceptance of a Multi- function Control. T. J. Kuechenmeister, Design Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper reports the results of a two-phase study of steering column mounted multifunction controls. A modified Mercedes Benz multifunction control (MFC) unit was installed in a 1972 Chevrolet station wagon. Control functions included were turn signals, washer, wiper, headlight dimmer, and optical horn. Phase 1 of the study investigated response time, error rates, and learning for this particular MFC. Phase 2 investigated subjective preferences, comparing the MFC with conventional controls and comparing alternative functions for inclusion in an "ideal" MFC unit. High error rates were found for first time use; however, subjects quickly learned to operate the unit with performance comparable to a representative panel con- trol. Subjective responses were highly favorable to the concept. 741002. General Motors of Canada Cold Weather Test Facility. M. G. Malloy, General Motors of Canada. Climatic conditions in parts of North America have created a need for cold weather testing of automotive products for this market. To fulfill this need, a Cold Weather Test Facility has been constructed and is in operation at Kapuskasing, in Northern Ontario. The need for the facility, its design and operation, the types of tests conducted, and typical test results obtained are discussed. 741003. General Motors Environmental Chamber for Vehicle Emission Testing. James A. Tysver, M-Vehicle Emission Lab., Proving Grounds, General Motors Corp. General Motors has built an environmental chamber at its Milford Proving Ground to run emission tests at con- 162</page><page sequence="122">741003-741008 trolled atmospheric conditions. This chamber was de- signed using constant speed fans and dampers to simulate altitudes between sea level and Denver, which is ap- proximately 5000 ft above sea level. The chamber can also control temperatures within a range of 45- 100° F at humidities of 9-100 gr H20/lb dry air. With this chamber, environmental conditions can be changed to desired levels very quickly to measure the vehicle sensitivity to the change. It is also possible to hold the environment constant and run controlled comparison studies on emission-related components to determine the effect of different distributors, carburetors, etc., relative to emission values. Past test experience has proved that vehicle emissions change with changing environment. However, the degree of change is different from one vehicle to another. 741004. Chassis Dynamometer Programming - A New Level of Realism Achieved. Richard A. Marshall and Edward F. Miller, Laboratory Equip. Corp. This paper describes a new, closed-loop programming system which faithfully transfers road operation to the chassis dynamometer. The system provides stable, rapid, accurate response to programmed speed and throttle position changes. Using a derivative of a torque-related signal, changes in power train performance are compen- sated realistically by electronic modification of either throttle or speed signals as a function of part or wide open throttle command. Under conditions of minor power loss, part throttle compensation is found to restore such uncontrolled parameters as engine speed and drive-line torque to the values measured without engine degra- dation. 741005. Exhaust Emissions 1966-1972 Model Year Light Duty Motor Vehicles. J. T. White III, C. J. Domke and M. E. Williams, Environmental Protection Agency. This report describes the results of a surveillance study initiated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to measure gaseous exhaust emissions from 1020 light-duty motor vehicles. This project was the second effort in a continuing program using the CVS Federal Test Proce- dure. Selected privately-owned vehicles, drawn randomly from six metropolitan areas, were tested in as-received condition. The emissions data obtained from these 1966-1972 model-year vehicles are reported in grams per mile of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon di- oxide and oxides of nitrogen while fuel economy is reported in mpg as determined over the Federal Driving Schedule. 741006. Emissions from In-Use 1970-1971 Diesel-Pow- ered Trucks and Buses. Karl J. Springer, South- west Research Institute; John T. White and Charles J. Domke, Environmental Protection Agency. A fleet of 64 heavy-duty 1970-71 model trucks and buses powered by a variety of diesel engines were tested periodically to determine exhaust smoke behavior. Smoke tests were made when the vehicle was new or nearly new and at four month intervals thereafter, or until 160,934 km (100,000 miles) odometer reading was reached. Gaseous emissions of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO) were measured at one point early in the project. Both smoke and gaseous emission tests were performed with chassis versions of the engine dyna- mometer Federal Test Procedures (FTP). Results in terms of "a" (acceleration), "b" (lugging), and "c" (peak) smoke factors versus mileage are reported for the 13 engine- vehicle-application groupings. 741007. Ford Auto/Emission Driver System. R. T. Gryce, Product Dev. Group, div., Ford Motor Co. The Ford Auto/Emission Driver System automates the driving of a test vehicle on a chassis dynamometer while it is undergoing exhaust emissions testing. The system "drives" the vehicle through the 1372 s EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule associated with the CVS-C and CVS-CH Test Procedures by applying the accelerator and brake pedals directly and also shifts the transmission if the vehicle is equipped with a standard transmission. The Ford Auto/Emission Driver System consists of a hybrid analog and digital electronic control console including a magnetic tape recorder and a servo hydraulic mechanical console linked to universal interface fixtures in the vehicle via flexible mechanical push-pull cables. The high response hydraulic rams are mounted remote from the vehicle to permit design of actuating fixtures which are compact, light weight and therefore easy to install. Test results indicate, based on several empirical parameters, that the system "drives" the test vehicle more repeatably than even the best human driver. 741008. Methanol as a Gasoline Extender - Fuel Econ- omy, Emissions, and High Temperature Drive- ability. Eric E. Wigg and Robert S. Lunt Methanol's potential as a gasoline extender has been evaluated, with data being obtained in the areas of fuel economy, exhaust emissions, and driveability. The results of tests with three cars, having carburetion spanning the range normally encountered in the existing car popu- lation, showed that methanol's effect on fuel economy and emissions could be directly related to its leaning effect on carburetion. The data suggest that any benefits in these two areas would only be significant for older, rich- operating cars. A 13-car driveability study indicated that the large increase in fuel volatility which occurs with the addition of methanol to gasoline could pose serious problems. A marked increase in vapor locking tendency was observed when no front-end volatility adjustments were made to the 163</page><page sequence="123">741008-741016 methanol blends. Stretchiness, a lack of expected response to throttle movement, was also found with the methanol blends. This operational characteristic, being related to excessively lean operation, was more pronounced with the newer cars tested. Phase separation is also a potential problem with methanol-gasoline blends. Data are presented which show the effect of including higher molecular weight alcohols along with the methanol. Phase separation still occurred in the presence of less than 1% water. Taken as a whole, the data suggest that, if it becomes available in large quantities, the use of methanol in applications other than in motor gasoline would be preferred. 1974 SAE Transactions 741009. Specifications for a Starter Interlock System. James A. Winnale, Fisher Body Div. General Motors Corp. A system has been developed for automobiles wherein the vehicle starting circuit and a light and sound warning system are controlled by a designated usage of the front seat belts. The system described in this paper was developed for vehicles produced by General Motors. Certain differences exist between this system and those developed by Ford and Chrysler. It should be noted that the operating characteristics of all the above systems are very similar. 741010. Development of an Electromechanical Interlock Module. L. W. Rogers, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. An electromechanical interlock module has been de- veloped for use on vehicles requiring a starter interlock system. This paper details the various types of relay modules considered for production use and their problem areas, and then proceeds to the development of the electromechanical interlock module released for produc- tion and how changes were made in the module to adapt it to an automotive type of environment. 741012. Design Considerations in Developing A Seat Belt Interlock Module. E. Cutshaw, RCA Solid State Division, Somerville, N.J. Some of the major design considerations involved in the production of a reliable seat-belt interlock module for the automotive industry are described. Emphasis is placed on the module operating environment, selection of comple- mentary MOS as a design medium, various stages of required logic implementation, and dynamic testing methods. 741013. Design of a Seat Belt Interlock Circuit. David E. Houser, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp. The Seat Belt Starter Interlock system for 1974 Model Year automobiles was developed to comply with Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208. A relatively complex electronics package is required to provide the seat switch and belt monitoring, decision making, and warning and starter control. To meet the logic requirements of this system, Delco Electronics chose bipolar technology to develop a custom integrated circuit. A latch is used for sequence detection and for restart memory. Input circuits are designed to avoid standby battery drain. Discrete rather than integrated power devices are used. High reliability is assured by providing protection from elec- trostatic discharge and other electrical transients. 741014. Application of Bipolar Technology to the Seatbelt Interlock System. J. Anthony Winger, Texas Instruments Incorporated. Bipolar integrated circuit technology can make important contributions to automotive electronics by combining digital and analog low current drain circuitry with relatively high current drive capability. This seatbelt- interlock module design consists of a 200-component logic integrated circuit designed with low threshold TTL drawing a nominal 3 milliamps and a driver integrated circuit which sinks up to 2 amperes steady state and 8 amperes surge. Integrated circuit protection is provided by 16 external discrete components. 741015. Schlieren-Streak Measurements of Instantaneous Exhaust Gas Velocities from a Spark-Ignition Engine. H. J. Yun, Ford Motor Company; and W. Mirsky, The University of Michigan. A schlieren-streak optical system for measuring instan- taneous exhaust gas velocities was developed and tested using a CFR single cylinder spark-ignition engine. Local density gradients which move along with the local fluid velocity in the exhaust gas flow, were used as velocity tracers in the schlieren system, and their motion parallel to the exhaust pipe axis was recorded by a streak camera. The performance of the schlieren-streak system was checked with a calibrated hot-wire anemometer by comparing the instantaneous exhaust gas velocity data obtained by both methods in a motored engine. The agreement between the two methods was within ± 10%. The schlieren-streak velocity data were also compared with the results of a computer simulation based on one-dimensional unsteady gas flow. The computed in- stantaneous cylinder and exhaust pressures were within ±8% of the measured values. The agreement between measured and computed instantaneous exhaust gas velocities was within ± 10%. 1974 SAE Transactions 741016. Locating IC Engine Hot-Spots Using a Mag- nesium Borate Solution. L. E. Woods and D. M. Kabat, Ford Motor Company. This paper presents an experimental technique for locating engine cooling system hot spots by using a Magnesium Borate water solution for the engine coolant. In doing so, Magnesium Borate is deposited wherever local boiling occurs thus indicating the high temperature 164</page><page sequence="124">741016-741025 areas. This technique was applied to a large V-8 engine and provided visual results of high temperature areas in the water jacket. Color photographs show the results, which correlate with measured metal temperatures and measured coolant flow velocities. The extension of the technique to include estimation of metal temperatures results from additional test data reported. The procedure is useful for locating unsuspected hot-spots in any passage in the engine cooling system. The severity of the temperature may be determined by knowing the Boiling Point of the solution. 741017. Temperature History in the Combustion Chamber of a Spark Ignition Engine. K. S. Varde, Colgate University; and G. G. Lucas, University of Technology (England). The temperature history at a location in the combustion chamber of a spark ignition (SI) engine is determined by using the intensity of radiation from the recombination continuum CO + O - &gt; C02 + hv. The flame was initiated separately at two locations in the combustion chamber while the radiation was monitored at one location thereby making the arrangement somewhat equivalent to monitor- ing the radiation from two different gas zones in the chamber. Agreement between the predicted temperature history with heat transfer and the experimental temper- ature measurements was found to be good around the stoichiometric region but large differences were noticed when the engine was run at lean mixture strengths. 741018. Computer Analysis of Bearings in Rotary En- gines. Pauline M. Edwards, Vandervell Products Ltd. (England). A suite of computer programs has been developed for the analysis of loading and lubrication characteristics of rotor bearings and main bearings in the rotary engine. The lubrication analysis was very similar to that for recip- rocating engines and required only very slight modifi- cation. 741019. Water Pump Bearing Life Prediction in Auto- motive Engine Application. J. P. McDonald, Ford Motor Company. Most automotive piston engines employ a front-mounted, belt-driven coolant circulation pump. The pump shaft is normally supported by a double row rolling-element radial contact bearing. The engineering analysis for an improved method of water pump bearing service load and life prediction is described here. This general analysis considers most of the design variations which are found among engines, water pumps, and bearings in current use. A rather thorough accounting has been made here of the various sources of bearing loading occurring in this application. Bearing life is determined according to the recently revised A.F.B. M.A. standards. 741022. Factors Affecting High and Low Temperature Performance in Liquid Reaction Molded Ure- thane Elastomer. R. M. Gerkin and F. E. Critchfield, Union Carbide Corporation. High and low temperature performance of various urethane elastomers is discussed in terms of compati- ble/incompatible polymer theory. The influence of polyol molecular weight, low molec- ular chain extender and isocyanate are presented and discussed in terms of their effect on the modulus/tem- perature sensitivity of the elastomers studied. 1974 SA E Transactions 741023. BAYFLEX: A New Material for Elastomeric Bumpers and Body Parts. Hermann Schaefer, Bayer AG. This paper is devoted to the development of polyurethane raw materials for elastomeric exterior body parts and the potential use of such BAYFLEX parts in these appli- cations. The results of the development of these types of urethane elastomers were demonstrated in 1974 with the production of flexible exterior body parts from BAY- FLEX 100 SR at Krauss Maffei in Munich. This successful demonstration represents only a beginning for the large scale use of elastomeric exterior body compo- nents in automotive applications. 741024. Rim Systems by Computer Techniques. P. S. Carleton, J. H. Ewen, Jr., T. M. Shah, E. J. Thompson, H. E. Reymore, Jr. and A. A. R. Sayigh, Upjohn Co. This paper examines the problems involved in predicting the behavior of urethane foams made by reaction injection molding (RIM). In general, RIM urethane foams are formed from mutually soluble stable liquid components into a 60 pcf foam with a durometer hardness of 50D and with sufficient strength to be removed from the mold in one min or less. Since impact resistance also is important with the materials, the property of low temperature impact is a basic selection criterion. A fundamental problem is how the desired impact resistance can be obtained without sacrificing other needed properties. This study describes how the creation of a mathe- matical model, based on experimental data, can be used to predict how basic properties of RIM urethanes will change as key variables are altered. 1974 SA E Transactions 741025. Reaction Molding Using High-Pressure Impinge- ment Mixing Equipment. R. A. Stengard, Uni- royal Chemical Div., Uniroyal, Inc. The use of high-pressure impingement mixing equipment for reaction molding of solid and cellular urethanes offers advantages in economics, molded product surface quality, and uniformity as well as the capability to produce parts on a short cycle time. This paper discusses some of the 165</page><page sequence="125">741025-741033 equipment available for reaction molding and reviews the history and products made with the process. 741026. Processing and Engineering of the Polyurethane Technology for the Automotive Industry. Fritz W. Pähl, Krauss-Maffei Ag. (West Germany). In dependency from the formulation of the initial components Polyol and Isocyanate, flexible, semi-rigid, rigid or structural Polyurethane foams are suitable for the most varied production of blocks or mouldings. It is the target of our review to present to you the latest standards of such processing techniques as are applicable to the manufacture of Polyurethane mouldings from the point of view of the automotive industry. In doing so, I shall make special mention of particularly developed, custom-made machines and installations. 741027. Reaction Injection Molding and Crash Pad Production. J. J. Lanfranchini, Société Quillery, France. Recent developments in equipment for Reaction Injection Molding (RIM) combined with improvements in self- skinning foam technology and part design have given a new dimension to crash pad production in the automotive industry. An example of such production applied to the French market is presented. In addition, a brief comparison of self-skinning foam crash pads via RIM versus other processes is outlined. 741028. Airflow Beneath an Automobile. B. Shawn Buck- ley, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology; and Edmund V. Laitone, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of California - Berkeley. A study of the airflow beneath an automobile relied on road tests of two test vehicles to reduce simulation errors caused by the moving road boundary. Testing verified the possibility of a very low Reynolds number boundary layer existing on the road beneath the vehicle. Flow separation associated with this boundary layer could have significant influence on the lift and pitching moments of the vehicle. 1974 SA E Transactions 741029. Three-Dimensional Airflow Visualization by Smoke Tunnel. Norihiko Oda and Teruo Hoshino, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan). A new smoke tunnel to visualize airflow around three- dimensional models has been originated for a study of automotive aerodynamics. The necessity to develop the facility, its technical data, and some examples of visual- ization are discussed. The facility, whose test section is 1 m high, 1 m wide, and 1.5 m long, is provided for 1/6-scale passenger car models. Thirty-nine lines of kerosene vapor in a vertical plane make airflow clearly visible at the airspeed of 2-9 m/s. The high Reynolds number of 2.5 X 105, based on wheelbase, is obtained. 1974 SA E Transactions 741030. Road Test Aerodynamic Instrumentation. B. Shawn Buckley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Two methods for obtaining aerodynamic pitching mo- ment and lift information have been developed using road tests of drivable vehicles. First, improvements in the dynamics of manometer tubes make onboard measure- ment of pressure distributions feasible. Second, a method for determining pressure distributions on a vehicle's underside from the road is valuable in verifying the accuracy of wind tunnel tests; no vehicle modifications are required. Both methods should improve the state- of-the-art in automobile aerodynamic instrumentation and testing. 741031. The Influence of Wind Tunnel Solid Boundaries on Automotive Test Data. William H. Bettes, Calif. Inst, of Tech.; and Kent B. Kelly, General Motors Corp. Wind tunnel tests were conducted on a series of 1/4-scale, 1/6-scale and 1/8-scale models of various automotive configurations utilizing a wind tunnel fitted with adjust- able ceiling and sidewall inserts. Force, moment, and static pressure distribution data were acquired and used to develop corrections which appear to account for the constraints imposed on the flow field about these bodies by solid tunnel walls. In addition test section size limitations are defined for the acquisition of reliable data from automotive configurations. 741032. Eliminating Errors in Chemiluminescence NOx Determination in Automobile Exhaust. George S. Turner and Dr. Murty Neti, Beckman Instru- ments Inc. The chemiluminescence determination of NO, and of N02 after conversion to NO, is capable of yielding quantitative results for concentrations ranging from ppm to 1%. In using the chemiluminescence method for automobile exhaust, fast response and specificity are additional benefits. There are many possible sources of error in sampling, transporting, and analyzing auto exhaust samples, particularly when appreciable amounts of N02 may be present. This paper discusses sources of error and how to detect and minimize or eliminate them. 741033. Impact of Altitude on Vehicular Exhaust Emis- sions. Donald E. Sorrels, Colorado Department of Health; Douglas R. Liljedahl and Jerry L. Terry, Automotive Testing Laboratories, Inc. The body of information presented in this paper is directed to those individuals concerned with the effects that changing altitude has on vehicle exhaust emissions. Emission data were developed from a sample of resident vehicles in Leadville, Colo, at a nominal elevation of 10,000 ft above sea level. Emissions-concentration sampling was performed on each vehicle in the sample at loaded and unloaded engine operating conditions. Con- centration data were then converted to mass data using 166</page><page sequence="126">741033-741038 equations developed from keymode and mass emissions testing of vehicles operating in the Denver area. Mass emissions data were then combined with mass data developed from vehicles operating in a metropolitan area situated near sea level (Chicago) to define the emissions versus altitude relationships for exhaust hydrocarbons (HC), CO, and NOx. HC and CO emissions at idle were also examined with respect to the applicability of a statewide minimum HC/CO idle emission standard for the State of Colorado. Contrary to expectations both mass CO emissions and CO emissions at idle were found to be lower from 1967 and older model-year vehicles operating in the Leadville area than from a similar sample of vehicles operating in the Denver area. These findings would indicate that vehicles operating at the higher elevations were probably modified in an attempt to improve vehicle operating characteristics. Also, since idle CO emissions were generally lower from vehicles operating at the extremely high elevations than from vehicles operating at lower elevations, a minimum HC/CO idle emission standard appears to be impractical for statewide application. 741034. Cycle by Cycle Variability in Emissions of a Spark Ignition Engine. E. E. Milkins, H. C. Watson, L. C. Goldsworthy and R. J. Hallworth, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Melbourne. The exhaust emissions from a single-cylinder spark ignition engine were measured as a function of burning time. Flame propagation time was measured with an ionization probe, and the exhaust gas was sampled with a gas sampling valve. Electronic control logic determined the cycles to be sampled, based on the flame propagation time. Tests were carried out at full throttle, for lean, optimum, and rich A/F. The exhaust components meas- ured were CO, HC, 02, H2, and N2 using a gas Chromatograph. The emission most affected by CBCV is CO. Cycles that are either faster or slower than the mean cycle have increased CO, particularly at lean A/F where a five-fold difference in CO concentration was measured. HC emissions show a 150% change for the same conditions. For other than lean A/F operation, H2 was an exhaust product, up to 6% at rich A/F operation. It is well established that reductions in CBCV would improve efficiency and power output. Here it is estab- lished that a reduction in CBCV would also reduce overall CO and HC emissions, particularly for very lean opera- tion. 741035. Test Variability of Emission and Fuel Economy Measurements Using The 1975 Federal Test Procedure. C. Don Paulsell and Ronald E. Kruse, Environmental Protection Agency. Several sets of repetitive test data using the 1975 Federal Test Procedure ('75 FTP) have been analyzed to establish the variability of each component measured during each phase of the test. The variability characteristics of four different emis- sion control systems have been discussed and compared. The overall variabilities of the '75 FTP composite values have been assessed at ±6% for hydrocarbons and CO, ±3% for NOx, and ±1% for C02. The extremely repeatable behavior of the C02 emis- sions is utilized to calculate the fuel economy during the test. This calculation is discussed and some fuel economy results from repetitive tests are presented. 1974 SA E Transactions 741037. A Preliminary Evaluation of Service Station Vapor Control Concepts. M. J. Manos, Scott Environmental Technology, Inc.; and A. W. Percy, Union Oil Co. of Calif. A program was conducted to evaluate the performance characteristics and to determine cost effectiveness rela- tionships associated with various prototype gasoline vapor control systems for service stations. Eight participating petroleum companies provided test facilities employing the direct displacement vapor control concept for eval- uation during the summer, fall, and winter seasons. Test results indicated that the direct displacement systems had the potential for controlling approximately 95% of the vapors that normally are emitted when a tank truck delivers fuel to the underground tank and when tight connections at the vehicle fill neck are obtained. One petroleum company provided a refrigerated-condensation vapor control system for evaluation which exhibited the potential for virtually 100 percent vapor control, again when tight connections at the vehicle fill pipe could be achieved. A few preliminary tests performed using an activated carbon adsorber during tank truck deliveries also indicated the potential for virtually 100% control. Initial cost data submitted by the participants indi- cates that the refrigerated-condensation system evaluated would cost two : three times as much as the direct displacement concept per pound of vapor prevented from entering the atmosphere, and 20 times as much for the incremental quantity controlled over the direct displace- ment system. 741038. Vapor Recovery Nozzle Development and Field Testing. B. E. Weidenaar, H. J. Grimes and R. G. Jewell, Atlantic Richfield Company. This paper outlines design considerations and criteria used to construct a prototype vapor balance gasoline nozzle. The nozzle incorporates a particular magnetic material on the face of the vapor recovery boot with a synthetic polymeric material on the sealing surface. A specific vapor recovery boot design is revealed which assists mating to the surface of the fill pipe. This nozzle was evaluated on 47 in-service vehicles at a specially equipped, commercial station in Chino, California. The prototype nozzle was solely supported by the automobile fill tube. Fill pipe-nozzle interface losses, car vent losses and station vent losses are all counted in 167</page><page sequence="127">741038-741047 the overall performance of the system. Percent vapor control was 88.9%. The investigators suggest that a fill pipe designed for vapor recovery would routinely yield results in the high 90s. 741039. Some Aspects of Suspension and Steering Design for Modern Compact Cars. J. H. Sorsche, K. Enke and K. Bauer, Daimler-Benz A.G. Regarding the utilization of space and savings in vehicle weight and cost, greater demands are made upon compact cars than on larger automobiles. The development of compact cars, therefore, requires a higher degree of care and expense. The designer is forced to compromise more than he would in the case of larger vehicles. This paper examines some present day problems which are of particular interest with respect to driving safety when we regard the development of the chassis for compact automobiles. These problems include suspension suitability for radial tires, axle kinematics, vibration characteristics, brake system design, handling, and legal requirements. 741040. The Design Concept and Techniques of Suspen- sion and Steering for the 1974 Toyota Corona. Akio Numazawa and Ryouhei Kizu, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. The 1974 Toyota Corona has been drastically changed to accomodate the required devices for emission control and to comply with safety standards. The handling and stability characteristics has been improved as well as vehicle performance. Steering effort and interior noise levels have been reduced. This paper presents the details of design concepts and the techniques that were employed to produce these improvements. 741041. Handling Performance Requirements of Auto- mobiles - Discussed in the Context of the VW Golf. F. Goes and A. Fischer, Volkswagenwerk AG, Germany. The recently introduced Volkswagen Golf, or Rabbit as it is known in North America represents the newest addition to the line of passenger cars manufactured Volks- wagenwerk AG. The considerations applied in the establishment of design goals in the handling sector are discussed in the context of a description of the vehicle suspension system. The state of knowledge and admin- istrative regulation of vehicle handling response char- acteristics are discussed in the context of design goals. 741043. Rotary Combustion Engine Trochoid Coatings and Seals. H. D. Lamping, M. W. Galliers and S. M. Wolosin, Curtiss-Wright Corp. This paper presents a review of Curtiss-Wrighťs efforts to identify or develop successful apex seal/trochoid sealing systems for the rotary engine. Included are descriptions of the various wear test rigs utilized to evaluate apex seal/trochoid coating combinations. Laboratory seal- coating screening procedures are detailed along with engine test results. Seal-coating design considerations including factors affecting seal loading and wear are described. Data are presented on a newly developed plasma spray coating containing titanium carbide. 1974 SA E Transactions 741044. Statistical Interpretation of Shaft Seal Perform- ance. Leslie A. Horve, Chicago Rawhide Mfg. Co. The radial lip shaft seal is a necessary, important component of modern machinery. A multitude of mate- rials and designs exist for a variety of applications. The manufacturer must choose a seal type that will satisfy the conditions of the application with high reliability and long life. Confidence in the choice is gained through functional testing. Typical functional tests involve four to twelve seals. These tests are usually run under accelerated conditions. The seals must perform without leakage for a given period of time (typically 100-500 h). This technique (success testing) provides limited information with low confidence levels. Nothing is learned about the failure rate distribution of the general population of seals. A more meaningful statistical procedure, Weibull analysis, is discussed and applied to seal testing. Exper- imental data are supplied and analyzed. The Weibull charts are used to determine the reliability and the limitations of seal design and material with high confi- dence levels. 741045. Automotive Accessory Drive Concepts for Mod- ern Engine Design. Roy E. Semin, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. An accessory drive system, using a single belt, has been developed for engines with a full or partial array of accessories. The system can be applied to overhead cam engines with the use of a synchronous driving surface on one side of the belt. The drive system offers space savings and reduced assembly costs due to fewer and simplified components. Benefits to the consumer include lower maintenance costs and easy belt replacement. 741046. Measurement of Automotive Timing Chain Drive Loads. S. A. Avramidis, Chain Div. FMC Corp. A system to measure loads that a timing chain is subjected to has been developed. The system consists of a special sprocket transducer and associated telemetry equipment. The conventional camshaft sprocket is replaced by the special sprocket transducer which senses the torque and transmits it by means of telemetry to recording equip- ment. The system made possible the investigation of param- eters that affect timing chain life and resulted in an improved timing chain design. 741047. Current Status of High Temperature Ceramic 168</page><page sequence="128">741047-741055 Gas Turbine Research and Development. E. A. Fisher and A. F. McLean, Ford Motor Co. The development of vehicular gas turbine engines to operate at temperatures up to 2500° F has been in progress for some time. The purpose of this paper is to review the rationale behind this engine, to highlight the major hot flowpath components being developed, and to provide information on the progress of this program. 741048. Suitability of a New Glass-Ceramic Material for Application in a Rotary Regenerator Disc Oper- ating at 1850°F. D. J. S. Wardale and S. T. Gulati, Corning Glass Works. The paper describes the factors which must be considered when assessing the suitability of a material for a rotary regenerator disc which runs at 1850°F. Mechanical and thermal stressing, thermal stability, and corrosion resistance are analyzed, using the properties of type CPD-5 material. This is a new lithium-alumino- silicate glass ceramic developed by Corning Glass Works. The environmental conditions assumed are those found in the 2500° F turbine inlet temperature engine which is being developed by the Ford Motor Company. 741050. Ceramic Monolithic Substrates - State of the Art. Malcolm G. McLaren and W. Richard Ott, Dept. of Ceramics, Rutgers University. The state of the art of producing ceramic monolithic substrates for automotive converters is reviewed. The requirements for the substrates, that is, thermal shock resistance, stability, strength, porosity, softening temper- ature, thermal expansion and size tolerances are discussed, as well as the capability of manufactures to meet the specifications. The substrates are being produced for 1975 model automobiles. The primary production problems center around edge and corner chips and web thickness varia- tions which occur in production and processing. 741051. Cold Ambient Temperature Effects on Emissions from Light-Duty Motor Vehicles. J. C. Polak, Emission Testing Laboratory, div., Environment Canada. An emission testing program conducted at Ottawa, Canada, indicated that the start-up and operation of light-duty motors at an ambient temperature of 0°F produces approximately a 100% increase in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions when compared with those produced at an ambient temperature of 60° F. This increase appeared to occur mainly during the initial 5 min of engine operation. 741052. The Effect of Ambient Temperature on Exhaust Emissions of Cars with Experimental Emission Controls. Donald L. Miles and Max F. Homfeld, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Three production cars and seven cars with various experimental exhaust emission control systems were tested to determine the effect of winter weather ambient temperatures on exhaust emissions. All of the cars were tested at 70, 40, and 20°F, and one was tested at 0°F using the 1972 EPA test schedule. Modal and bag emission data as well as catalytic converter temperature data were obtained. The results of these tests are presented in this paper. There was an increase in HC and CO emissions as ambient temperature was reduced. Most of the increase came from the first cycle of the 18 cycle test and was the result of additional time required to reach operating temperatures. NOx emissions did not vary substantially with ambient temperature. Discussion: John B. Edwards, Ford Motor Co. 1974 SA E Transactions 741053. Vehicle Emissions - Summer to Winter. H. A. Ashby and R. C. Stahman, Emission Control Technology Division, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency; B. H. Eccleston and R. W. Hurn, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Department of Interior. A test program was conducted to study the effect of ambient conditions on exhaust emissions from a wide variety of automobiles. Twenty-six cars ranging from pre-control production cars to catalyst-equipped proto- types, including rotary, Diesel, and stratified charge cars, were tested at 20°, 50°, 75°, and 110° F. Ambient temperatures above and below 75° F were found to have significant effects on exhaust emissions. The Diesel and stratified charge cars were affected less than production and catalyst-equipped cars by changes in ambient temperature. The use of air conditioners at the 110° F test temperature led to increased emissions and fuel con- sumption. Hydrocarbon reactivity and aldehyde emissions were not affected by temperature and were lower from the catalyst cars at all temperatures. 741054. The Impact of Vehicle Emissions on Air Quality at Low Ambient Temperatures. J. E. Robertson, GM of Canada. Cold weather tests have been conducted on various engine components to monitor their operational modes at differing ambient temperatures. The results presented in this paper provide insight into the influence these components have on characteristic exhaust emissions at low ambient temperatures. In addition, atmospheric pollution levels have been monitored in general across Canada and specifically by the City of Toronto, Ontario, which indicate that season- ally these levels do not increase in cold weather. This is contradictory to the motor vehicle emission performance. Reasons for this apparent contradiction are expressed in this paper. 1974 SA E Transactions 741055. Lean Combustion and the Misfire Limit in Spark Ignition Engines. Ather A. Quader, Res. Lab. 169</page><page sequence="129">741055-741059 div., General Motors Corp. Low nitric oxide (NO) emissions and good fuel economy are obtainable at very lean mixtures. However, unstable operation caused by misfire and erratic combustion prevents present spark ignition engines from being operated very lean. A study was undertaken to understand what causes very lean mixtures to misfire in engines. The effects of mixture preparation, intake airflow, exhaust gas recirculation (simulated by N2 dilution), compression ratio, intake mixture temperature, engine speed, and number of spark plugs and their locations were inves- tigated at minimum advance for best torque (MBT) spark timing in single-cylinder engines. Propane and isooctane were the fuels used. Results showed that leaner operation was possible with improved mixture preparation, increased airflow, decreased nitrogen (N2) dilution, increased compression ratio, increased mixture temperature, decreased engine speed, more central spark location, and multiple spark plugs. The dominant factors responsible for these effects were mixture homogeneity, charge dilution, and charge temperature. In most cases, at the lean limit the combus- tion duration (in crank angle degrees) reached a limiting value. The significance of these findings together with the exhaust emission and fuel consumption results are presented and discussed. Discussion: T. W. Ryan, III and S. S. Lestz, Pennsylvania State University. 1974 SA E Transactions 741056. High Speed Knock in S.I. Engines. V. Arrigoni, Petroleum Products Laboratories, div., Snam Progetti (Italy); S. Sirtori, Alfa Romeo (Italy); G. M. Cornetti, FIAT Research Laboratories (Italy), G. Spallanzani, F. Calvi and A. Tonto- donati, Petroleum Products Laboratories, div., Snam Progetti (Italy); S. Sirtori, Alfa Romeo (Italy). The importance of minimizing fuel consumption has necessitated the study of knock which drastically limits the attainment of high combustion efficiency in current s.i. engines. In the present work, four aspects of this phenomenon have been examined: 1. Knock intensity levels encountered during actual service operation of European cars. 2. Knock intensity levels that do not cause engine damage in endurance tests. 3. Factors affecting the knocking behavior of a fuel. 4. The meaning of the knock rating characteristics of a gasoline using the research and motor methods. It was found that the most severe knocking conditions were those met with by small displacement engines at a sufficiently high constant speed (4000-5000 rpm) and wide-open throttle. In these conditions, high knock intensities, much greater than the trace level, are needed to cause engine damage. Motor Octane Number is the most important parameter in controlling high-speed knock at all engine speeds, this was determined using the CFR engine under fuel stress conditions very similar to those present in commercial engines. 741057. Air Velocity Measurements in Engines by Vortex Shedding. Lee L. Chen, P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, Univ. of Wisconsin. This paper describes a new application of Karman vortex shedding frequency as a velocity sensor in a motored internal combustion engine cylinder. The probe design, experimental setup and data reduction procedures are described. The quality of data obtained depends strongly on the relative frequency distribution of the free-stream turbulence and of the vortex shedding induced by the vortex generator. The instrument was evaluated on a CFR engine equipped with a shrouded intake valve. The results are presented in terms of the airswirl ratio at several selected crank angle degrees versus engine speed. The limitations of the device were also demonstrated in L-head engine tests. 1974 SA E Transactions 741058. Prediction of the combustion properties of gaso- lines from the analysis of their composition. S. Sirtori, Alfa Romeo (Italy); P. Garibaldi and F. A. Vicenzetto, Snam Progetti (Italy). Some equations have been statistically obtained for calculating the combustion properties of gasolines from simple analytical data like density and FIA analysis (hydrocarbon composition: saturates, olefins, aromatics) or PONA analysis (hydrocarbon composition: paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, aromatics). The equations have been obtained by applying multiple correlation analysis to data calculated for 66 commercial and 58 experimental gasolines knowing their GC composition and the properties of each hydrocarbon which were obtained from the literature. The heat of combustion, and the Carbon to Hydrogen (C/H) ratio calculated by means of these equations have been experimentally verified by means of normal analyt- ical methods. Good agreement has been found for both these quantities and for the other combustion characteristics such as, air to fuel ratio (A/F), water of combustion, and molecular expansion, all of which are directly related to the above. The statistical analysis is based on the FIA and PONA data, and hence the validity of the equations obtained only holds for the field of applicability of these analytical methods. 741059. Fuel, Oil and High Temperature Effects on Noble-Metal Oxidation Catalysts. A. Koenig, H. Hellbach and G. Doering, Volks wagenwerk AG. Ageing tests were conducted on two monolithic noble- metal oxidation catalysts on an engine using various fuels and oils, and in a furnace with an air atmosphere. The activity of the aged catalysts was determined by labo- ratory apparatus and related to the results of chemical 170</page><page sequence="130">741059-741065 analyses of the catalyst specimens. It was found that pure thermal ageing at temperatures above 700°C can lead to a severe loss of activity even without additional catalyst poisoning. Of the impurities contained in the fuel, phosphorus is the most dangerous catalyst poison. Changing from a lead and phosphorus sterile fuel to a 'lead-free' fuel in accordance with the EPA specification leads to a no- ticeable worsening of ageing results. Within the antici- pated range of sulfur concentration, sulfur has no influence on long-term results. The choice of engine oil affects catalyst ageing only slightly. 741060. Sulfate Emissions from Catalyst-Equipped Au- tomobiles. Charles R. Begeman, Marvin W. Jackson and George J. Nebel, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Because of the minute quantity of sulfur in gasoline, all gasoline-powered vehicles emit sulfur oxides. Automotive emissions of sulfur oxides, however, are insignificant since, according to a 1970 Environmental Protection Agency estimate, gasoline-powered vehicles are respon- sible for only 0.6% of sulfur oxide emissions nationwide. Furthermore, all of the sulfur oxides in the atmosphere are gradually oxidized to sulfuric acid and sulfate by natural processes. Catalytic converters of the type installed on 1975 model automobiles reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by oxidizing them to carbon dioxide and water. In the process some of the sulfur dioxide in the exhaust gas is also oxidized to sulfur trioxide, which combines with water to form sulfuric acid and sulfates. Sulfate emissions from 19 catalyst cars, 4 noncatalyst cars, and one diesel passenger car were measured with the 1972 Federal Test Procedure (FTP). Some vehicles were also tested with the 1975 FTP and at 30, 40, and 60 mph. A large constant-volume-type sampling system was used to dilute and cool the exhaust, and approximately 1.5% of the exhaust was sampled on filters. 741061. Ford 450 Car Catalyst Field Test. E. E. Weaver, J. W. Shiller, R. M. Campau and J. F. Macura, Ford Motor Company. This paper evaluates the performance of monolithic automotive exhaust catalysts under conditions of actual customer usage. Conclusions are based upon a field test that involved 450 catalyst equipped cars which accu- mulated 7.3 million miles of customer driving by the end of July, 1974. Based upon the results obtained from the 450 catalyst equipped vehicles, it was concluded that the monolithic type catalyst is an efficient device for reducing hydro- carbon and carbon monoxide emissions in customer usage. The effects of accumulated vehicle mileage, engine maintenance, three alternate catalyst designs, catalyst over-temperature, partially melted catalysts, misfueling with leaded fuel, and vehicular accidents on the per- formance of the catalyst system are discussed. 741062. Scavenger and Lead Poisoning of Automotive Oxidation Catalysts. Gerald J. Barnes, Kenneth Baron and Jack C. Summers, General Motors Research Laboratories. The deactivation of noble metal oxidation catalysts by lead and halide lead scavengers was studied in engine and laboratory experiments. The halide scavengers caused rapid but completely reversible inhibition of the catalyst activity, which existed only as long as the halide was present. The effects of catalyst temperature and noble metal concentration indicated that the halide scavenger dissociated upon adsorption on the catalyst. Palladium and platinum-palladium catalysts were more susceptible to halide inhibition than were platinum catalysts. Lead alone or lead plus scavengers produced a persistent poisoning of the catalyst. Lead poisoning effects were increased by increased catalyst temperatures and fuel lead content. Tests with scavengers only, conducted in an engine previously operated on leaded fuel, showed that lead was transported to the catalyst causing lead poisoning even in the absence of lead in the fuel. These experiments showed that the reversible scavenger inhibition effects could be superimposed on the persistent lead poisoning effects. 741064. A Rear Disc Brake for American Passenger Cars. C. E. Ballard, R. W. Emmons and F. L. Janosi, Ford Motor Company; and K. Goering, Kel- sey-Hayes Company. Rear disc brakes were released as standard equipment on 1975 Mark IV and as a regular production option on 1975 Lincoln, Thunderbird, and Mercury. This brake is the result of a joint Ford/Kelsey-Hayes design and devel- opment effort. The key feature is a single-piston sliding caliper with an integral, self-adjusting parking brake mechanism. The design offers great flexibility in pack- aging on various car lines and on different axles. This paper describes the major features of the design and the significant problems found and overcome in the development program. 1974 SA E Transactions 741065.

However, recent efforts to improve directional stability when braking, and the implications of the various European and American legal requirements, particularly their influence on brake system design and performance, gives cause for a general review of the disc brake, how it has been used in the past, and what the future will mean. It is concluded that while some vehicle manufacturers are showing the way to improved braking performance, it will be desirable for others to follow suit to meet the 171</page><page sequence="131">challenges facing the automotive industry of the next decade. 741066. A Radiometric Method for Apex Seal Wear Measurements in Rotary Engines. William J. Mayer, Robert L. Anderson and Donald C. Lechman, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. A radiometric method has been developed to measure apex seal wear in rotary engines. Seal wear rates are measured in ranges of /xg/min without engine dis- assembly, and at various speed and load conditions using a dynamometer. The method incorporates radioactive apex seals in the front rotor of a Mazda 10A engine. Neutron irradiation of commercial carbon-aluminum apex seals produced radioisotopes of iron and chromium. Experimental carbon-aluminum seals, containing terbium oxide as an additive to improve the nuclear properties of the seals, were also used. The radiometric method involves the following steps: 1. operation of a rotary engine at any desired engine condition with radioactive apex seals, 2. collection of the seal wear debris by filtering the exhaust gas, and 3. the quantitative determination of the resulting radioactivity on the filter medium. The method is capable of measuring apex seal wear at a specified engine condition in approximately 25 min (three min sampling time, and a maximum of 20 min counting time). With the experimental (terbium oxide additive) seals, the counting time is reduced to six min. Precision of the method is + 10%. Apex seal wear was measured with several engine oils and automatic transmission fluids; the wear data were used as performance criteria to rate these lubricants. The data indicated that automatic transmission fluids were as good as engine oils for apex seal lubrication in the Mazda 10A engine, and that kinematic viscosity of the lubricant may not be the important variable in carbon-aluminum apex seal lubrication.

Apex Seal Wear in a Mazda Rotary Engine - Effects of Fuel and Lubricant Properties Util- izing Radioisotope Test Techniques. T. H. Hacha, Standard Oil Co. (Ohio). This paper presents a study of apex seal wear utilizing radioisotope test techniques. Test data showing the effects of lubricant viscosity and quantity and the influence of various engine oil and fuel additives on apex seal wear are presented. Radioisotope test data are compared to seal wear results of long-duration tests to demonstrate the validity of radioisotope test results. 741068. Rating Method and Lubricant Appetite Study for an Air-Cooled Rotary Engine. J. A. Russell and S. J. Lestz, United States Army. Experimental results with a 25-hp charge-cooled rotary combustion engine are presented for a variety of lubricant base stocks and additive packages. A rating method which combines endurance and deposition level is described. Lubricant performance is evaluated based upon this rating scheme, and contribution of base stock and additive package components is analyzed. 741075. A New Interfacing Concept: The Monolithic Temperature Transducer. Peter Lefferts, Na- tional Semiconductor Corp. A monolithic integrated circuit has been developed that is a sensor, a voltage reference, and an operational amplifier, all in a simple four-lead package. Although the circuit is designed to sense absolute temperature as a physical parameter, certain application techniques allow other inputs to be handled. Differential temperature, position, and air velocity can be converted to analog, on-off, or frequency outputs as desired. Specific examples are provided. 741076. Temperature Measurement Utilizing Platinum Resistance Sensors. Mohan Dutt, Rosemount Inc. Platinum resistance sensors are currently used for con- tinuous service from -260°C to +800°C and up to 1200°C for short term use. The historical development of resistance sensors is discussed and the advantages of using platinum resistance sensors over thermocouples is de- scribed. Parameters used in the evaluation of platinum sensors and signal conditioners are enumerated. Errors encountered in temperature measuring schemes and methods to reduce these errors are summarized. 741077. Design Solutions for Temperature Sensing in Difficult Automotive Applications. Bertrand J. Misek, Texas Instruments, Inc. Three different types of temperature measurement on the automobile and the development of suitable controls are discussed. High temperature probe controls for emission catalysts; small, fast response thermostats for engine blocks; and PTC ceramic sensors for a variety of uses are developed. 741078. A Miniature Sensor for Measuring Heat-Transfer Rates in Engines. James N. Mattavi, General Motors Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Experimental insight derived from the measurement of heat transfer rates is useful in a number of engine-related activities - ranging from developing simulations for pre- dicting engine performance to defining cooling require- ments for insuring the integrity of engine materials. Consequently, a device for measuring steady-state heat- transfer rates in a solid was designed after an extensive heat-transfer analysis. Subsequent experimentation and development has led to an accurate miniature sensor which can be installed directly into a parent material with little thermal disturbance. An analytical model of the sensor, installed in the combustion chamber wall of an 172</page><page sequence="132">741078-741083 engine, predicted this disturbance error to be 3% or less over a wide range of parent material properties and engine operating conditions. Experimentation at four heat- transfer rates confirmed this predicted performance. Although motivated by engine development programs, this heat-flux sensor is potentially applicable to a broad range of experimental investigations. 741079. Modes of Deactivation of Exhaust Purification Catalysts. M. F. L. Johnson, J. Mooi, H. Erickson, W. E. Kreger, E. W. Breder, J. A. Jaecker and J. P. Kuebrich, Atlantic Richfield Co. Crushed samples of Engelhard PTX(II-B) catalyst were calcined at temperatures between 900-2700° F. When the temperature exceeds about 1100°F in air, the crystallites of precious metals (platinum-palladium) grow larger, exposing less surface for catalysis. When the catalyst is exposed to temperatures on the order of 1500- 1800° F for extended periods of time (16 h or more), the wash-coat tends to lose a substantial percentage of its surface area. Finally, above about 2300° F, the cordierite of the ceramic becomes converted to mullite and amorphous material. The intrinsic rate constant for the oxidation of pure propylene is inversely related to Pt-Pd crystallite size. Thus, in the absence of poisoning, changes in intrinsic oxidation rate constant can be accounted for by changes in degree of dispersion of precious metal. Catalysts examined after 8000-20,000 equivalent miles of steady-state (70 mph) on a stationary engine with catalyst temperatures at 1350- 1500° F show results con- sistent with those obtained from our calcination studies. After service in normally operated 1971 vehicles, severe deactivation sometimes occurred, which could be ac- counted for only by attainment of temperatures in excess of 2300°F. Calcinations in the presence of lead compounds result in the conversion of most of the precious metal from the active metallic state to a state in which it is dissolved in the ceramic. Pore volume distribution data after artificial or real deactivation conditions were used to obtain diffusion coefficients for use in a published model. The changes had little effect on the results. As lead deposited during steady-state engine testing increased in the 0.2-5% range, the intrinsic propylene oxidation rate decreased. Examination of the catalysts confirmed that lead caused conversion of the Pt-Pd from an active metallic state to one in which they became dissolved in the ceramic, just as in the calcination experiments. We thus estimate the intrinsic propylene oxidation activity of deactivated catalyst from Pt-Pd crystallite size if no lead is present, or from percent lead. Division by the activity for fresh catalyst gives a relative activity. 741080. Some Aspects of The Mechanism of NOx Reduc- tion over Nickel Alloy Catalysts. Chin Ho Lee and M. P. Makowski, Gould Labs., Div., Gould Inc. The mechanism of reduction of nitric oxide by hydrogen and carbon monoxide was studied on base metal catalysts under simulated automobile exhaust conditions. The catalysts were low copper-nickel alloys supported on an all-metal open-mesh substrate. Space velocity and con- centrations of inlet and outlet NO, H2, CO, and 02 were used as study parameters. Dependence of ammonia formation on the hydrogen content in the gas was established. It was found that the dependence of ammonia formation on the oxygen content could be accounted for by the reaction of oxygen with the hydrogen produced by the water-gas reaction. In general, indications were obtained that under the conditions studied, the reduction of NO on base metal catalysts proceeds by a mechanism in which ammonia is an intermediate. 741081. Durability Experience with Metallic NOx Cata- lysts. R. J. Fedor, F. M. Dunlevey, R. W. Henry and R. R. Steiner, Gould Inc. Results with a modified dual catalyst system incorpo- rating Gould's Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) reduction catalysts are presented. The key factors controlling durability are examined through laboratory, engine dynamometer, and vehicle tests. Test data is presented showing that control of oxygen input to the NOx catalyst can result in significantly improved durability. Results indicate that by combining oxygen input control with a new low ammonia forming catalyst, stable NOx catalyst performance can be achieved through 25,000 miles of AMA mileage accu- mulation. Potential failure mode factors are also dis- cussed. 741082. Design Considerations of Adaptive Brake Control Systems. R. R. Gun tur, Vehicle Research Lab- oratory, University of Technology, Delft. In this paper, some of the design aspects of adaptive brake control systems are studied, especially the interaction of the software with the hardware of the system. Two modes of operation of the brake pressure modulator have been considered; the software changes are effected to modify further the mode of operation of the system. The effect of the rate of rise of wheel cylinder pressure and the effect of rate of decay of pressure on the effectiveness and the maximum wheel slip in the first cycle have been studied. The hardware and the software are so modified as to give satisfactory performance of the wheel and the vehicle for four different forward speeds and for three different road conditions. 741083. Wheel Lock Control Braking System. Robert A. Grimm, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. Automobile and truck manufacturers have given increas- ing attention to electronic wheel lock control brake systems during the last few years. These systems prevent continuous wheel lock-up 173</page><page sequence="133">741083-741092 during maximum braking stops, thus aiding the driver in retaining lateral stability and generally improving stop- ping distances. This presentation discusses a system for preventing continuous rear wheel lock-up of an automobile during maximum braking stops. Included is a description of the control system components, tire and road characteristics, brake and vehicle dynamics, and an analysis leading to the requirements for optimum control. 741084. Introduction of Antilock Braking Systems for Cars. Hans Christof Klein and Werner Fink, ITT-Teves Germany. The overall question of brake actuation, antilock control and other vehicle functions requiring servo assistance will be discussed. Too much effort has been devoted in treating each of these units on an individual basis. This paper describes ways in which this complex subject can be dealt with in a unified manner, to provide a more compact and reliable solution. 741085. The Use of the Computer in Determining Brake Balance. J. W. Douglas, Chrysler Corp. In order to predict vehicle brake performance, calcu- lations are made to determine the size of brakes, wheel cylinders, proportioning valves, and metering valves to give the desired results. To achieve this, basic data are required of brake torque output versus brake force input. This requires that a large amount of test data be accumulated from both dynamometer and vehicle tests to obtain the coefficient of friction of disc brake linings and brake factors for drum brakes. All the data available has to be presented in a meaningful form that can be understood with a minimum of study. This report deals with gathering of test data, brake balance calculations, and presentation in a graph- ical form by means of the IBM 1130 computer and graphing system. 741086. An Investigation of Brake Balance for Straight and Curved Braking. Rudolf Limpert and Franco E. Gamero, University of Utah; and Ron Boyer, Dynamic Science Div., Ultrasystems. Most motor vehicles operating on our highways today are designed to exhibit high levels of straight-line braking performance without providing sufficient stability during combined braking and steering maneuvers. A basic engineering analysis is presented that allows optimum values of brake balance to be determined for both straight and curved braking. The effects of brake fade on brake balance are discussed. Different wheel antiskid systems are analyzed, and test results are presented for three domestic vehicles. A methodology for determining ex- pected safety benefits of advanced brake systems is reviewed. 1974 SA E Transactions 741089. Mass Burning Rate in a Rotary Combustion Engine. K. C. Tsao and D. Losinger, University of Wisconsin. This paper reports the mass-burning rate in a rotary combustion engine. The mass-burning rate is calculated through an iterative constituent and energy constraints during the combustion process. First approximation is obtained through the firing and motoring-pressure trace as recorded by an image-retaining oscilloscope and recorded subsequently by a polaroid camera. Effect of engine load, engine speed, relative (A/F) on the mass- burning rate and maximum heat release rate were studied. Three different type of fuels were used in the experimental test runs. 741091. The Effect of Selected Coolants on Metal Tem- peratures in a Rotary Engine. G. A. Paul, Ag-Organics Dept., div., Dow Chemical Co. Rotary engines, by design, are somewhat more difficult to cool than conventional reciprocating powerplants. This arises in apart from the fact that all four cycles do not take place within the same physical portion of the engine. The basic aim of this research was to study the metal temperatures of many points in the rotary engine with standard and experimental coolants in an attempt to develop a product with superior heat rejection properties in a conventional cooling system. The engine used for the experiment was a two-rotor liquid-cooled Wankel engine obtained from a 1972 Mazda R-100. Both road and chassis dynamometer evaluations were run over a wide range of operating conditions to obtain a comprehensive look at coolant performance. The parameters studied for each coolant were road speed, engine load, coolant concentration, and ambient tem- perature; the coolants tested were ethylene glycol, water, and the experimental coolants XA-1318L and XA- 1318. 1L. Pure water was found to produce the lowest rotor housing metal temperatures under mild conditions of the four fluids tested; ethylene glycol produced metal housing temperatures above acceptable levels under severe test conditions. Both XA-1318L and XA-1318.1L reduced peak rotor housing metal temperatures compared to ethylene glycol, although XA-1318L appeared slightly inferior to XA-1318.1L. Under more severe test condi- tions, however, the two experimental brands of coolant were the most effective in reducing metal housing temperatures. It was concluded that XA-1318L or XA- 1318.1L would be satisfactory coolants in a rotary engine. 741092. Real-Time Computer Network. George Y. Kimm, General Motors Corp. A real-time process computer network has been developed at the General Motors Research Laboratories. Mini- computers are connected to a large computer in a satellite-host configuration. The minicomputers are ded- icated to local experiment activities. The expensive peripherals and the high-level programming capabilities at 174</page><page sequence="134">741092-741102 the host are made available to the minicomputer users. 741093. Computer for Engine Test Instrumentation. Don R. Sutherland, Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp. The General Motors Research Laboratories have equipped two engine test cells with instrument systems containing minicomputers. These systems measure 200 variables and convert them to engineering units for display to the test operator on a high-speed video terminal. The computers also perform calculations such as mass airflow, composite inlet temperature, and equivalent horsepower, which are combinations of several measured variables. Many of the test parameters are corrected to standard conditions of temperature, pressure, and humid- ity. This paper discusses these systems, mentioning both past experiences and future plans for linking into a host-satellite network. 741094. A Real Time Data System for Inertial Dyna- mometer Brake Tests. C. E. Bridge, M. E. Gatt and D. W. Howard, Automotive Controls Sys- tems Group, The Bendix Corporation. Factors which govern the selection and application of a computer based Real Time Data Acquisition System are identified. The impact of programming language level as it affects both hardware and personnel requirements are noted. Interface considerations with the laboratory test facility are presented. 741095. Microcomputers in Instrumentation. J. V. Clore and F. Thorley, Jr., General Motors Corp. Microcomputer technology has added a new dimension to the design of test instrumentation, but the connotations of the name microcomputer have a tendency to build barriers rather than offer solutions to problems. His- torically, computers have been treated as systems or identifiable subsystems in instrumentation applications. The implications of complex hardware and mystical programming is often sufficient to direct the user to alternate technologies. In a new light, clear of earlier prejudices, the microcomputer becomes a functional module like other LSI devices. Flexible and economical systems involving logical control, data gathering, and numerical calculations are possible utilizations of these relatively new devices. This paper discusses a facility to assist the designer in development of test instrumentation. Emphasis is placed on use of the microcomputer as an integral part of system design. Test instrument applications are cited. 741096. A Primer on Nonlinear, Steady-State Vehicle Turning Behavior. R. W. Topping, B. F. Good- rich Co. A simple, linear vehicle model is presented which incorporates the most important characteristics of con- temporary passenger cars. It is a three mass model with a fixed, inclined roll axis and linear suspension geometric and compliance characteristics. Basic concepts of understeer and oversteer are pre- sented. Static and dynamic requirements are examined, yielding expressions relating the car's design to tire lateral load transfer, total lateral force, and turn radius. Turn kinematics give expressions for the front steer angle and sideslip angle. Suspension geometric and compliance effects describe the rear steer angle, tire inclination angles, and steering wheel angle divided by the overall steering ratio. 741099. Ford Ignition Interlock Design Considerations. D. M. Rukavina and. R. A. Wilke, Lake Center Industries, Inc. A seat belt interlock design is described which includes several operator convenience features: RESTART mode, seat bounce filtering, and voltage transient protection circuitry. A two pin oscillator implemented with CMOS technology is also described. 741100. The Effects of Tire Wear on Vehicle Behavior. Shunji Tsuchiya, Tadakiyo Watanabe and Yoi- chi Matsuoka, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. This paper discusses the cornering characteristics during the progress of tire wear and how the stability and controllability of a vehicle varies in the various stages of tire wear. With the introduction of tire parameters appropriate to represent the characteristics of tire con- struction, the method of calculation of the cornering characteristics of a tire is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, this paper shows the values of tire param- eters in the various stages of tire wear in both cases of bias belted and radial tires. 741101. A Method for the Evaluation of the Lateral Stability of Vehicles and Tires. F. Celeri and A. Chiesa, Industrie Pirelli S.p.A. (Italy). The report starts by outlining some concepts regarding the forces and the moments which act on a tire. Some general characteristics of indoor cornering force machines, along with their limitations, are then examined. This is followed by a detailed description of a method of measuring tire-vehicle curves on a steering pad. The method, based on experience obtained by the use of mathematical models, permits a quantitative evaluation of the stability and the steering of a vehicle under steady state working conditions, on both wet and dry tracks. It is also shown that certain aspects of the vehicles behavior in transient conditions may be deduced from the data obtained. The method is valid for both cars and two-axle trucks and it is illustrated with some examples. 741102. The Influence of Tire Wear on Steering Prop- erties and the Corresponding Stresses at the Tread-Road Interference. S. A. Lippmann and K. L. Oblizajek, Uniroyal, Inc. The paper presents data showing the effects of the state of 175</page><page sequence="135">741102-741106 wear, structure, load, and inflation pressure on the cornering stiffness and aligning torque stiffness of typical passenger tires. A method is introduced and applied for assessing contributions of local elements of the tread interface to the cornering force, the cornering stiffness, the aligning torque, and the aligning stiffness. There is also a further identification of the contributions to the aligning torque from fore and aft interfacial stress distributions and from lateral stress distributions. Pneumatic trail is redefined in the light of the interfacial measurements, and values are established for various operating conditions, states of wear, and tire types. 741103. General Motors Tire Performance Criteria (TPC) Specification System. Kenneth G. Peterson, Fraser D. Smithson and Fredrick W. Hill, Jr., Tire and Wheel Engineering, General Motors Proving Ground. Over the years, General Motors has expended consid- erable effort in the selection of tires for use on its vehicles. In the early days, tires were evaluated within GM by vehicle development engineers and selected primarily on subjective ride and handling evaluations. The tire manu- facturer was responsible for certifying his tire's per- formance in the other areas such as traction and durability. With this type of tire procurement system, each manufacturer's tire was a design created on criteria judged by that manufacturer to be satisfactory. As General Motors tire testing technology increased, the objective evaluation of our supplier's products indicated variations in other areas of performance among our suppliers. Variation in tire performance from different sources supplying the same size original equipment tire for a specific usage was only one of several reasons why General Motors Management initiated a GM Tire System Improvement Program. Field surveys were conducted which indicated that customers desired improved original equipment tires in areas of performance, warranty, and service. Further, analyses of aftermarket tire performance characteristics indicated that if replacement tires from various sources, while nominally of the same size and type, were intermixed on a vehicle, there could be a resulting change in the vehicle's handling qualities. For GM owners who choose to purchase "TPC" specification tires, the "TPC" system enables them to avoid variations in their vehicle handling due to tires. In 1971, a Central Tire Group was established to direct the GM Tire System Improvement Program with headquarters located at General Motors Proving Ground. This group was assigned the tire responsibilities to provide: future planning; liaison with tire companies, GM divisions, and the government; evaluation and devel- opment of tires; tire specifications; tire quality assurance: service and tire warranty program coordination. Each of these activities then formulated plans to resolve the particular problems related to their areas of concern. 741104. Understanding Tire Intermix Through the Cor- nering Compliance Concept. R. L. Leffert, P. M. Riede and R. E. Rasmussen, Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory, General Motors Proving Ground. There are many ways to describe the factors contributing to the directional control dynamics of motor vehicles. The cornering compliance concept is particularly applicable to the tire intermix situation since it helps to separate the front and rear contributions to total vehicle performance. The relationship between cornering compliances and vehicle response properties, discussed in previous papers, is reviewed. The contribution of tire mechanical properties to cornering compliance is described. Typical compliance levels associated with intermix of generic tire types, wear states, and brands are listed. 1974 SA E Transactions 741105. Driving Simulator Studies: The Influence of Vehicle Parameters on Safety in Critical Situa- tions. Bernd Richter, Research and Develop- ment, Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). Earlier VW driving simulator studies showed the rela- tionships among subjective driver judgement, objective parameters and a vehicle parameter TB. The present series of tests was run to determine the effects of the steering ratio iLK with combinations of this parameter TB. The driving task was more difficult than those in earlier studies: the test subject tried to avoid suddenly appearing obstacles. This made it possible for the test subjects to become involved in critical situations, and for conclusions to be drawn from review of the potential accident sequence, as influenced by the vehicle parameter TB and the steering ratio. The report then presents examples to illustrate the effects of tire parameters and load parameters on the vehicle parameter TB, in a variety of different vehicles. 741106. A Multif actor Examination of Wet Skid Resis- tance of Car Tires. Ir. A. Dijks, Delft University of Technology, Vehicle Research Laboratory. Most of the studies concerning wet skid resistance of tires concentrate on the effect of a single factor, the other variables being kept constant or assumed to be constant. In the Netherlands, the Vehicle Research Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology, in cooperation with a working party of the Institute for Road Safety Research (SWOV) has conducted extensive series of measurements according to statistical multifactor test programs. The wet skid resistance is rated by three coefficients: The peak value of the normalized braking force, the locked wheel value, and the maximum of the normalized side force. Special test programs are described which aim to investigate the influence of road surface parameters, such as texture depth and SRT values (British Pendulum Tester), and of tire parameters on wet skid resistance. The tire parameters consist of tread factors, compound factors, and a carcass stiffness parameter. Empirical formulas have been established which indicate that wet skid resistance is dependent on adhesion 176</page><page sequence="136">741106-741115 and hydrodynamic factors. In these two factors, both the influence of road surface parameters and of tire param- eters have been quantified. The road surface parameters were studied, particularly in a special test series performed on six different test strips. The dominant tire parameters have been established in a special test program using 18 different common production tires, in another special test, the influence of tread depth of the tire has been examined. It appears to be feasible to describe this influence by means of a function depending on wear percentage, speed, and texture depth of the road surface. 1974 SAE Trans. 741107. The Effects of Tire-in-Use Factors on Passenger Car Performance. Paul S. Fancher and James E. Bernard, Highway Safety Research Institute, University Of Michigan; and Lloyd H. Emery, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion, U.S. Depart, of Transportation. Results which have been obtained from flat-bed tire tests and linear-range steady-turning vehicle tests show that tire-in-use factors have a large influence on the normal driving performance of passenger cars. Test data for bias, belted-bias, and radial tires have been gathered to quantify the effect of inflation pressure, tread wear, and shoulder wear on tire shear force performance. A mobile tire tester has been used to measure maximum traction characteristics for worn and under-inflated tires on wet and dry pavements. The importance of the interaction of steering compliance with tire force and moment properties has been examined. 741108. Tire Properties Effects on Passenger Car Han- dling. R. Douglas Roland and Roy S. Rice, Calspan Corp.; and Edward Kakaley, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. A recently completed research program has dealt with the problem of determining the influence of tire construction properties on vehicle braking and handling performance. Several tire properties that affect vehicle dynamic re- sponse have been identified and their effects quantita- tively determined. Laboratory testing of a large sample of tires has shown that aspect ratio and basic construction type (that is, bias, bias-belted, radial) can significantly affect tire peak braking coefficient and cornering stiffness. The results of computer simulation studies and exper- imental tests with four automobiles have shown that the effect of changes in the peak braking force coefficient of tires on the average longitudinal deceleration of vehicles with fixed brake proportioning was small. The most marked departures from the handling performance with the OE tire configuration occurred when the performance characteristics (primarily cornering stiffness and peak lateral force coefficient) of the tires at the front and rear were different. 741109. The Design Approach to Reliability. F. Shaw, Automobile Div., Institute of Mechanical En- gineers. Reliability in a finished product can only be ensured when the designer has taken care to achieve the optimum solution to the sum of the needs of a particular set of circumstances. To follow this design philosophy, the designer must determine the function of the product, the length of time it will be required to operate correctly, and the amount of maintenance which is acceptable. When the necessary knowledge and information have been obtained from all available sources, then it is time to translate this concept into a product design. The engineering drawing is the message which com- municates a reliable design to the production department so that it may be converted into a reliable product. The key to successful design is collaboration among as many designers as possible to maximize the amount of infor- mation and the number of ideas available, with one "manager of design" to coordinate their activities. This manager of design must be of the highest personal integrity since component reliability is impossible without personal reliability. Top designers should be encouraged to remain in designing. There are many examples of good and bad approaches to the design problem. Some historical examples offer insights into design practices, and a very fine example of cooperation and coordination of design efforts is given in the casting used in the British Leyland Range Rover gearbox. 741113. Suspension and Steering Fundamentals of the BMW 520. E. Gebler, Bavarian Motor Works. This paper discusses the unique characteristics of the BMW 520. Beginning with overall specifications of the vehicle design, it proceeds to discuss in detail the front-wheel suspension and rear-axle systems. The adapt- ability of the suspension system to the requirements of diagonal ply conventional or radial tires is stressed, as is the simplified installation and maintenance of the front- wheel subassembly. The relatively friction-free steering system and the reduced steering effort achieved by the camber-offset axle are noted, along with the measures used to control steering vibration and wobble, as features incorporated in the BMW to achieve reliability, ease of maintenance, safety, and crashworthiness. 741115. On Driving Performance and Road Noise: An Experimental Investigation. A. Raouf, University of Windsor (Canada); and R. Luiz, Department of Communications (Canada). A brief comparison of human performance in a man- machine system and in a Vehicular Transport System is carried out. Factors influencing the human performance are cited. Some of the problems connected with research work pertaining to VTS are summarized. Results of an experimental investigation, in which effects of road noise and vehicle speed on human performance were studied, are reported. The findings of the investigation indicate 177</page><page sequence="137">741115-741131 that noise is a significant variable as far as human performance in a VTS is concerned. 741125. Past and Contemporary Trends of Commercial Vehicles in Japan as Viewed by Fleet Owner. Hitoshi Yanase, Nippon Express Co., Ltd. (Japan). The paper concerns the development of motor truck transportation in Japan from its inception to the present day. Factors influencing the development of such trans- portation, including an initial lack of gasoline and the uses of substitutional fuels, the popularization of diesel engine trucks, the necessity to conserve fuel, geographical considerations, changes in the construction .of trucks to lower costs and maximize efficiency, and the necessity for special-purpose trucks are discussed in detail. Predictions of future trends and a consideration of ways in which motor transportation will be combined with other modes of transport are also offered. 741126. Dieselization of Light and Medium Duty Com- mercial Vehicles in Japan. Ryoji Kihara, Taro Yamaguchi and Yasuo Mikami, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan). This paper describes the recent trend toward dieselization of light and medium duty trucks in Japan. The customers needs are of prime consideration in engine development. Improvements have been made mainly in the areas of increased power, fuel economy, and anti-pollution. Maximum effort is being applied to meet government regulations both in exhaust emissions and noise. Some of the recent engineering in light duty, high speed diesel engines in Japan are described. 741127. The Economical Design of the Datsun Pickup. Fumio Suzuki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The development of the Datsun pickup is traced from the post-World War II model with a wooden body, to the modified passenger car, to the current independent truck model. Some differences between the Datsun pickup and other Japanese-made trucks and American-made trucks are discussed. It is noted that the Japanese stress load efficiency: the Americans do not. Problems with size- dependent taxation rates; crowded roads; and scarce, expensive oil supplies have all led to a compact, eco- nomical design. Also discussed are the truck's adaptability to export destination requirements and its body construction. 741128. Design and Operation of European Trucks for Maximum Fuel Economy. Andrew Arabia, Gen- eral Motors Overseas Operations. This report has been developed as a review of the general design and operation of European commercial vehicles from a product planning point of view. Particular regard has been given to the optimum utilization of petroleum fuels. Certain patterns established overseas may be of help in planning future truck designs in the United States to cope with the possibility of increasingly restricted fuel supplies. 741129. BrakeSaver - Caterpillar's Highway Truck Re- tarder. Charles T. Darragh, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A hydrodynamic retarder for heavy duty highway trucks has been developed to fill the need for a high capacity silent truck retarder that is independent of truck ground speed. This retarder is mounted between the engine crank- shaft and the flywheel to take advantage of the trans- mission speed multiplication. Engine oil is the working fluid and the engine cooling system is used to dissipate the heat of retardation. The retarder designed for the new Caterpillar 3400 Series of heavy duty truck engines is described. Ratings that can be adjusted from 200 to 550 hp with minor hardware changes and unitized construction that can be adapted to many other engine configurations are the unique features of the design. 741130. Engine Design for the Future. H. W. Barnes- Moss, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engrs. (1927), Ltd. Engine design is now increasingly influenced by envi- ronmental legislation in addition to the traditional commercial and economic factors. The controlling pa- rameters are identified and their effect on engine speci- fication discussed. Proposals are made for the design of future power plants to meet these needs. 741131. Evolution of a New Combustion System for Diesel Emission Control. R. Bertodo, T. W. E. Downes and I. D. Middlemiss, Perkins Engs. Co. (England). The emission control of small naturally aspirated diesels has posed severe problems and it has been generally thought that their acceptability in pollution sensitive areas would decline. The investigation described attempts to reverse this view. The exhaust quality of engines of this type can be improved by reducing the combustion temperatures and/or reducing the initial heat release rate: a range of methods of achieving this were examined and found commercially unacceptable. A qualitative review of the problem led to the evolution of a modified cycle characterized by high turbulence leading to higher air/fuel mixing rates and faster diffusion burning. This "Squish Lip" combustion system allowed CARB 1977 projected emission levels to be met on development engines without performance deterioration. Bench and field trials are in hand and a second generation system for truck applications is being evaluated. 1974 SA E Transactions 178</page><page sequence="138">741132-741139 741132. Retreaded Truck Tire Noise Tests. Ralph C. Raabe and loan Burche, Bandag, Inc. Noise tests were conducted on new and retreaded truck tires of a wide variety of patterns using three different procedures. Single tires on the test wheel and 2-tire sets on the road were correlated with the standard 4-tire sets in accordance with the Recommended Practice SAE J57 Procedure. The correlation was analyzed and the conversion techniques were discussed with the conclusions that it is possible to convert test wheel data to equivalent road test data. The results show that retreaded truck tires are not noisier than new tires of similar construction and tread design. 741133. Practical Aid to Off-Road Tire Evaluation with Bevameter Techniques. M. G. Bekker, Consult- ing Engineer. A simple method based on bevameter soil values enables the engineer to evaluate the motion resistance of a pneumatic tire, in the given soil, and to perform para- metric analyses of design and performance. The param- eters measured include, besides soil parameters, the following characteristics of the tire: width, diameter, inflation pressure, carcass stiffness, and load. An inex- pensive electronic desk calculator assures accuracy of prediction that is more than satisfactory. Discussion: M.

This paper explains how structural properties of radial and bias ply truck tires affect tire and vehicle perform- ance. The author concludes that a knowledgeable evaluation of the pros and cons of both bias and radial ply truck tires be based on individual operational evaluations and the compromise of tire characteristics which best satisfy needs. Neither radial nor bias ply truck tires can be generalized as the superior choice since each type has areas of superiority. 741135. On-Road Braking and Cornering Performance of Various Off-Road Tire Patterns. I. R. Ehrlich, G. Wray and J. Nazalewicz, Stevens Institute of Technology. Ten sets of tires with nine different off-road tread patterns were tested on a paved surface using a towed, in- strumented trailer to measure their cornering character- istics (wet and dry) and their braking performance (wet, full skid). The data obtained and a method for rank ordering are presented. 741136. Problems and Advances in Radial Tire Retread- ing. H. R. Baumgardner, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. This paper discusses equipment and procedures required to retread radial tires, emphasizing truck tires; reviews retreading process for conventional tires; and notes changes required for radiais. In exploring the most extensive problem, inability to properly contract and expand radiais to provide curing pressure, the paper indicates the need for an elastic matrix and supports use of precured tread systems. 741137. Light Truck Tire Traction Properties and Their Effect on Braking Performance. D. J. Bickerstaff and G. Hartley, Ford Motor Company. Tire traction test data has shown empirically that peak skid number dry pavement traction performance of bias ply tires is inversely proportional to the dynamic instan- taneous tire load and is a function of inflation pressure. A modification to classical braking theory, which assumes constant traction coefficients at the tire-road interface, is therefore required to obtain maximum theoretical un- locked wheel vehicle deceleration. Optimum brake pro- portioning between front and rear axles is dictated by the maximum braking force which, with respect to each axle, can be generated at the tire-road interface. The inclusion of peak traction coefficient normal load sensitivity significantly modifies classical theory and changes the selection of brake force balance required to attain maximum theoretical deceleration capability. The impor- tance of the effects of tire traction load sensitivity on the requirements of FMVSS 105-75 is discussed in this paper. 1974 SAE Transactions 741138. Mobile Truck Tire-Traction Test System. John L. Bradisse, A. Frank Ramsey and Steven R. Sacia, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company. A mobile test station has demonstrated its effectiveness in measuring straight-ahead traction coefficients of truck tires. This system - incorporated into a modified trailer- tractor combination - is designed to test the entire range of light-truck and heavy-truck tires now in production. The tire carriage assembly is installed in the center of the flat-bed trailer. The tire is hydraulically loaded to the ground through an opening in the bed. To ensure reasonably valid tire-traction data, the system is designed to minimize variations in such test parameters as load, brake line pressure, vehicle speed, and tire orientation. The mobility of the system makes it possible to test tires on various types of road surfaces, thus providing a complete spectrum of surface coefficients for both wet and dry conditions. 741139. Preliminary Measurements of the Longitudinal Traction Properties of Truck Tires. Robert D. 179</page><page sequence="139">741139-741159 Ervin and Paul S. Fancher, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan. A mobile dynamometer has been constructed for meas- urement of the longitudinal force/slip characteristics of truck tires. The application of this apparatus in testing of a preliminary sample of tires has indicated that the shear force production properties of truck tires differ in many respects from the corresponding behavior of passenger car tires. These differences are discussed in terms of shear force sensitivity to a number of operating variables. The inadequacy of current semi-empirical tire models in representing truck tire traction is noted. 741142. Frame Design Analysis Under Complete Vehicle Boundary Conditions. Wayne A. McClelland, Jay K. Hay and Albert L. Klosterman, Struc- tural Dynamics Res. Corp. In recent years, significant advances have been made in analysis and testing of vehicle frames. In particular, sophisticated finite element techniques have been de- veloped that enable the designer to predict and evaluate frame design from the drawing board stage. However, most applications of this technology have, until very recently, been aimed at evaluating static response of the frame to certain "program" loads. This paper describes applications of an approach that considers interaction between the frame and remaining vehicle components (suspension-power train-body structure) during dynamic loading of the entire vehicle. Techniques and applications of dynamic frame mod- eling are presented, including discussions of open section beam modeling, cutouts, joint flexibilities, and attachment considerations. Methods for determining dynamic prop- erties of remaining vehicle components, including con- cepts of digital Fourier analysis and constrained modal testing, are described and illustrated by means of actual applications. Concepts for assembling and solving the total vehicle governing equations are presented for static, periodic, transient, and random in-service loadings. 741143. A Case for Standardization. Charles J. Owen, Whi taker Cable Corp.; and Gordon F. Cantlay, Western Gillette, Inc. This paper outlines several specifications for heavy-duty truck wiring, especially wire and harness assemblies, and low-tension electrical wire. Emphasized are avoidance of substandard wiring and components, identification of circuits, grounding techniques, and contruction. It is noted that improved specifications will result in reduced maintenance costs. 1974 SA E Transactions 741145. A New Structural Performance Standard for School Bus Bodies. W. E. Jahsman, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Colorado. A comprehensive structural performance standard for school bus superstructures is being developed by a special task force on school bus safety organized by the School Bus Manufacturers Institute. This paper presents a progress report on the standard. Included is a review of the main features: the basic philosophy that the bus body must be capable of safe, controlled energy absorption in the event of a crash; the establishment of a statically equivalent test through the use of energy absorption as a simulation parameter; and detailed specifications for simulated crash modes. As a specific example, the rollover simulation test specification is presented in its entirety and a critical assessment is provided. 741156. A Classification of Reciprocating Engine Com- bustion Systems. O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, University of Wisconsin; E. E. Marsh and G. E. Cheklich, Army Tank Automotive Command. Obtaining and maintaining a stratified charge in a practical engine is a difficult problem. Consequently, many approaches have been proposed and reported in the scientific and patent literature. In attempting to assess the most profitable approach for future development work, it is important to group together similar approaches so that one can study their performance as a group. Making such a classification has the additional advantage of helping to standardize terminology used by different investigators. With this thought in mind, a literature study was made and a proposed classification chart prepared for the different engine combustion systems reported in the literature. For the sake of completeness, the finally proposed classification chart includes homogeneous com- bustion engines as well as heterogeneous combustion engines. Because of their similarity of combustion, rotary engines such as the Wankel engine are considered as "reciprocating" although gas turbines are not included. The characteristics of each combustion system are analyzed and those having similar characteristics are grouped together. 1974 SA E Transactions 741158. NOx Emission and Fuel Economy of the Honda CVCC Engine. Shizuo Yagi, Tasuku Date and Kazuo Inoue, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. (Japan). In this paper, the experimental results concerning the effect of the geometrical and operating factors of the CVCC engine on NOx emission, taking into consideration the fuel economy, are described with respect to a specific engine configuration, and they are compared with the results calculated by means of the mixture formation model. Furthermore the relationship between the NOx emission level and specific fuel consumption has been explained, and then it has been shown that the controlled combustion obtained with the CVCC engine is very effective for eliminating fuel economy penalty and reducing emissions. 741159. Pre-Chamber Stratified Charge Engine Combus- tion Studies. Egils A. Purins, Ford Motor Company. 180</page><page sequence="140">741159-741165 Single-cylinder experiments were conducted with a 3- valve, carbureted pre-chamber stratified charge engine in comparison with a conventional engine. The pre-chamber engine operation is governed by many design and operating variables. This investigation was limited to determining the effect of overall air/fuel ratio, ignition timing and EGR on emissions and fuel economy at a single road load test condition. It was found that, as for the conventional engine, these operating variables are also significant for the pre- chamber engine and that a compromise must be made between good fuel economy and low emissions. The main virtue of the pre-chamber engine was found to be the ability to operate at leaner overall air-fuel ratio. This resulted in lower nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions than the conventional engine without EGR. The unburned hydro- carbons (HC) were found to be higher for the pre- chamber engine up to the conventional engine lean misfire A/F ratio. Exhaust gas introduced into the pre-chamber was found to reduce NO emissions significantly without a large corresponding increase in HC emissions as observed with the conventional engine. Only at very low NO emissions with severely retarded spark timing and/or high EGR rate did the pre-chamber engine show a fuel economy advantage over the conven- tional engine. As the test program was limited to one load and speed, the results should not be construed to be typical of all modes of operation. 1974 SAE Transactions 741161. The Roll of Connecting Nozzle and the Flame Initiation Point in the Performance of a Dual Chamber Stratified Charge Engine. K. S. Varde and M. J. Lubin, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Sciences, Univ. of Rochester. Experimental work is carried out to investigate the importance of the connecting nozzle between the auxiliary and the main chambers and the ignition point location to the performance of a stratified charge spark ignition engine using Broderson's method of charge stratification. Three different nozzle configurations and two ignition point locations were used in the present experiment. The study shows that the fuel economy obtained with this approach is dependent upon the nozzle geometry which also plays an important role in the combustion noise generation, a characteristic of this method. The results show good fuel consumption over the entire range; the analytical work on the combustion of the mixture in the auxiliary chamber indicates that flame initiation near the center of the nozzle opening has a potential of restricting the flow of unburned mixture in the main chamber. 741162. Single-Cylinder Study of Stratified Charge Pro- cess with Prechamber-lnjection. F. F. Pischinger and K. J. Klöcher, Lehrstuhl für Angewandte Thermodynamik an der Rheinisch-Westfälis- chen Technischen Hochschule Aachen. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to knowledge of the behavior of the stratified charge engine with pre- chamber injection by experimental investigation of several important parameters. Special attention is given to degree of charge stratification, position of injection nozzle and spark plug in the prechamber, construction of the injection nozzle, start of injection, timing of ignition, and throttling of the intake air. These parameters have a more or less significant influence on output, fuel consumption, and exhaust emission. Finally, the combustion system was adjusted partly by optimizing and partly by compro- mising. Comparison with a conventional spark ignition engine is made. Using a mathematical model of the process, the possible causes of the significant improve- ments in NO emissions are discussed. 1974 SAE Transactions 741163. 3-Valve Stratified Charge Engines: Evolvement, Analysis and Progression. Michael C. Turkish, Eaton Corporation. A historical review of the patents and literature pertaining to 3-valve stratified charge engines is presented in this paper. This very old invention appears to be a practical approach for the "clean engine" being sought for vehicular use since it has the intrinsic capability of simultaneously giving good fuel economy and producing minimal objectionable exhaust emissions. The prime requisites of this engine are a rich prechamber charge and a very lean main chamber charge regardless of pre- chamber volume, nozzle diameter, valving and spark plug location. Fuel-air equivalence ratios of the charges in the two combustion chambers are significantly important in order to achieve the proper optimization. These ratios should be about 15% rich for the prechamber and 15 to 30% lean for the main chamber at the moment of ignition. The proper values for the two carburetor fuel-air equivalence ratios and the two intake manifold pressures, as well as several less influential engine design parameters, are methodically established by computer analysis of engine breathing and charge mixing. An air-swirl inducing main intake port and a lean thermal reactor are complementary to this engine struc- ture as verified by improved results in laboratory tests. 1974 SAE Transactions 741165. Flame Propagation in an Eddy Combustion Chamber. A. D. Margolin and V. P. Karpov, Academy of Sciences (U.S.S.R.). Combustion in model eddy combustion chamber was investigated in order to obtain insight into the combustion mechanism. High-speed schlieren cinematography and recording of the ionization current were used in the experiments. It was established theoretically and experimentally that the flame kernel formed by ignition at periphery 181</page><page sequence="141">741165-741170 moved towards the rotation axis and reached it in a time of the order of that for the mixture rotatory cycle at the periphery, irrespective of the circular speed of gas rotation and of the chamber size. After reaching the rotation axis, the kernel acquired the form of rotating body. The radial spread of this body can be lower than the visible rate of the immobile gas burning, due to the fast elongation of the rotating body along the axis. The results obtained are essential for understanding the phenomena occurring in eddy chamber of diesel engine and engines with spark ignition at an eddy motion. 741167. Combustion Characteristics of the Torch Ignited Engine. Yasuo Sakai, Kazuya Kunii, Saburo Tsutsumi and Yasuhiko Nakagawa, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). Experimental work of the torch ignited engine demon- strated that this engine provided stable engine perform- ance and low exhaust emissions using an overall lean mixture. Some combustion characteristics of the torch ignited engine were compared with those of a conventional one. Experimental analysis was performed to determine the influence of a number of prechamber inlet air-fuel ratios and nozzle diameters. These are respectively a main operating factor and a main design factor of the torch ignited engine. These factors control the torch combustion process and determine engine performance and emission characteristics. 1974 SA E Transactions 741168. Volume and Temperature Influences on the Effectiveness of Lean Thermal Reactors. John E. Lahiff and William C. Albertson, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. This paper describes work done to separate and further define the effects of volume and temperature on the effectiveness of exhaust thermal reactors operating at lean (18-22:1) A/F ratios. Thirty feet of stainless tubing with a volume of over 1200 in.3 was added to the exhaust manifold of a 4 cylinder engine. The entire assembly was insulated to serve as a constant temperature "lean reactor". Exhaust emission and temperature measure- ments at various points along the "reactor" provided data on the extent of the HC and CO oxidation reactions as a function of reactor volume. Mass flow calculations were made to calculate exhaust gas residence times. The data are presented as percent HC and CO reacted versus gas residence time in the reactor and are plotted to show the effect of reactor temperatures ranging from 1275° F to 1675° F at various inlet HC concentrations. Limited data are also presented on the effect of exhaust flow rate on mixing. 1974 SA E Transactions 741169. A Two-Charge Engine Concept: Hydrogen En- richment. John Houseman and Frank W. Hoehn, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. The first engine dynamometer test results are presented for a modified fuel system based on hydrogen enrichment for a V-8 I.C. engine. The engine burns mixtures of gasoline and hydrogen under ultralean conditions to yield extremely low NOx emissions with increased engine efficiency. The hydrogen is produced in a compact onboard generator from gasoline and air. The hydrogen-rich product gas is cooled and mixed with the normal combustion air in a modified carburetor. The engine then operates in the conventional manner on atomized gasoline with spark ignition, but with hydrogen-enriched air and with a high spark advance of 40-50° BTDC. The engine thus receives two charges of fuel: a charge of gaseous fuel from the hydrogen generator, and the normal gasoline charge. The results on hydrogen enrichment are compared with the 1973 V-8 baseline stock engine with emission controls, and the same engine without controls and operated at maximum efficiency under lean conditions. All results are compared at level road load as a function of rpm. Relative to the stock 1973 350 CID engine, an approximate 10 percent reduction in brake specific fuel consumption was measured over the entire level road load speed range. For the same condition, NOx emissions were reduced to below the equivalent 1977 EPA Standards (0.4 gm/mi). Further effort is required to reduce the remaining two exhaust pollutants to the corresponding level i.e. 0.41 gm/mi HC and 3.4 gm/mi CO. The hydrogen enrichment concept is compared with a pre-chamber stratified charge engine. The analogy is made that if the pre-chambers for each cylinder were combined into a single precombustor, it shows some similarities to the hydrogen generator. 1974 SA E Transactions 741170. Analysis of the Flow and Combustion Processes of a Three- Valve Stratified Charge Engine with a Small Prechamber. G. C. Davis, R. B. Krieger and R. J. Tabaczynski, Research Labs., div., General Motors Corp. The flow and combustion processes of a three-valve, stratified charge engine with small prechamber are examined for exhaust emissions. The exhaust emissions from a single-cylinder version of this engine are shown to depend on the internal flow processes as well as mixture supply stoichiometry. A theoretically-based simulation model of the engine flow and combustion processes is described. Model predictions are compared with time-resolved prechamber air-fuel ratio measurements made during intake and compression strokes. These comparisons are used to illustrate and describe the complex flow phenomena which take place in this engine. The combustion process is then examined with the aid of calculations using the simulation model. The com- 182</page><page sequence="142">741170-741175 plexity of the combustion process is illustrated by showing that, in addition to burned gas temperatures, the cylinder and prechamber burned gas air-fuel ratios change with time. NO kinetic calculations are compared with exhaust measurements as prechamber flow and stoichiometry are changed. 1974 SA E Transactions 741171. Calculated Nitric Oxide Emissions of an Un- throttled Spark Ignited, Stratified Charge Inter- nal Combustion Engine. Rodney J. Tabaczynski and Edward D. Klomp, Research Lab., div., General Motors Corp. This paper presents a theoretical study of nitric oxide emissions from an unthrottled stratified charge, spark ignition engine. This investigation was undertaken to determine the nitric oxide production when an ideal rich-lean stratification is present and to determine the effects of introducing an intermediate stoichiometric region. In order to study this problem a three-region (generally rich, stoichiometric, and lean) combustion model was used, and the effects of the following variables were studied: 1. Excess air number of the rich mixture. 2. Percentage of the total fuel in the rich-mixture region. 3. Percentage of fuel burned stoichiometrically. 4. Exhaust gas recirculation, percentage and distri- bution. Comparisons are made to both experimental results from a throttled engine and calculated results for an unthrottled engine with a homogeneous mixture. For illustrative purposes, an application of the model to a particular geometrical form of charge distribution is analyzed. 741172. A Search for a Low Nitric Oxide Engine. L. W. Evers, P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, Univ. of Wisconsin. Various homogeneous charge and stratified charge engine configurations were studied at wide-open throttle con- ditions, using simplified computer models. An order- of-magnitude parametric study was performed to find those combinations of variables which predicted a low nitric oxide level. Extreme values of variables were studied for a homogeneous charge engine configuration, which could be difficult to do in a real engine. As expected, these calculations indicated that for practical engine operation the equivalence ratio of the mixture must either be very rich or very lean for a resultant low nitric oxide level. Two extremes of stratified charge engine operation were investigated analytically, in other words, immediate mixing of newly formed products of rich combustion with excess air (instantaneous mixing) and a period of rich combustion followed by air addition to the rich products (delayed mixing). Comparisons of power, efficiency, and specific NOx are presented. For a low level of specific NOx the acceptable engine configurations are very rich ho- mogeneous combustion, very lean homogeneous combus- tion, overall lean instantaneous mixing stratified charge and overall stoichiometric delayed mixing stratified charge. 741173. The Volkswagen PCI Stratified Charge Concept - Results from the 1.6 Liter Air Cooled Engine. W. R. Brandstetter, G. Decker, H. J. Schafer and D. Steinke, Volks wagenwerk AG (Germany). The Volkswagen prechamber injection stratified charge concept has a divided combustion chamber with part of the fuel injected into the prechamber and the intake manifold. Various combustion chamber configurations have been investigated in single-cylinder engine tests, and their applicability to the four-cylinder engine is discussed. The development of the third-generation 1.61 air- cooled opposed cylinder engine, along with its mechanical fuel injection system, is described. Engine maps of the prechamber injection engine are discussed, and engine performance data are specified. Test results on the dynamometer show very low nitrogen oxide emissions with fuel economy not impaired; however, hydrocarbon emissions without aftertreatment are still unsatisfactory. 741174. Introducing a New Generation of More Detailed and Informative Combustion Models. Frediano V. Bracco, Guggenheim Labs., Princeton Uni- versity. The problem of modeling combustion within internal combustion engines is considered. A method is explained to evaluate the comprehensiveness, detail and predicting capability of a model. It consists of considering the equations for the most comprehensive and detailed model and in making successively more restrictive assumptions, thus getting progressively less detailed models. Particular attention is paid to the reasons for the assumptions, how they influence the accuracy of a model, and what basic information is missing. In so doing, the most detailed of the available models, and their predictive capabilities and limitations, are introduced. They include models for reciprocating and rotary engines, with uniform and stratified charges from dual carburetion and direct fuel injection. Examples of their results are given. One of them has been available since 1971, and another one is currently and fruitfully employed to aid the development of a production engine. Also introduced are more advance models presently under development and their appli- cations. The equations of the most common and least detailed models are derived from the most general equations, thus evidencing their inherent limitations. 741175. The Effects of Charge Stratification on Nitric Oxide Emission from Spark Ignition Engines. M. Watfa, D. E. Fuller and H. Daneshyar, Univ. of Cambridge. Charge stratification has long been considered the best feasible means of burning overall weak mixtures. This 183</page><page sequence="143">741175-741179 offers the attractions of fuel economy and relatively low levels of pollutants emitted from the engine. In this paper, two idealised models of charge stratification are consid- ered theoretically, with the emphasis on nitric oxide emissions. The first model represents a linear variation of fuel-air equivalence ratio, from a fuel rich mixture of the first element to burn, to a fuel weak mixture of the last element to burn. The effects of the slope of the equivalence ratio to mass fraction burned and the mean value of the equiv- alence ratio on nitric oxide emissions are analysed and discussed. The second model represents a step variation in the equivalence ratio, with two different zones each having a constant value of the equivalence ratio, and each being homogeneous within itself. The nearest to this model in practice is the double chamber engine, with a fuel rich primary chamber and a fuel weak secondary chamber. The theory analyses and discusses in detail the effects of the ratio of the two equivalence ratios, the ratio of the primary to secondary charge mass, and the overall mean equivalence ratio on exhaust emissions of nitric oxide. Furthermore, the intake and compression strokes of such a system prior to ignition are considered, showing the continuous variations of equivalence ratios. 741176. (P-56) Impact Performance of Some Designs of Steering Assembly in Real Accidents and Under Test Conditions. P. F. Gloyns and G. M. Mackay, Department of Transportation and Environmental Planning, University of Birming- ham England. This paper describes the results of a three year field study into the crash performance of three basic designs of steering assembly, fitted to British cars. These systems have evolved to comply with current European and United States safety standards. While one design, in- volving a large-area, self-aligning steering wheel mounted on a conventional column, appeared from the field data to be highly effective in preventing serious chest and abdominal injury, the two systems utilizing axial-collapse steering columns proved to be essentially ineffective in practice. This finding is based on a field accident sample of 108 cases, so sampled as to be representative of the severe end of the collision speed and injury spectra. A test program was undertaken to examine the procedures currently used to evaluate steering assemblies. It was found that tests carried out in compliance with FMVSS 203 failed to differentiate between the safe and unsafe systems described above. Additionally, it was noted that the mode of damage to the steering assemblies produced by normal testing was quite unlike anything seen in the field. Modifications to the test procedures were made that enabled accident damage to be accurately reproduced, but even under these conditions, the peak load injury criterion failed to show any differences between the designs tested. Only when both peak load and effective loaded area were taken into account could the major differences observed in the field be demonstrated under test. In conclusion, suggestions are made for alterations to present steering assembly testing techniques that will allow the impact equipment currently used to predict usefully the field performance of steering assemblies. 1974 SA E Transactions 741177. (P-56) Experiment and Accident: Comparison of Dummy Test Results and Real Pedestrian Ac- cidents. Helgo Schneider, Technical Supervisory Association (Germany); and Gundolf Beier, Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Munich (Germany). To clarify to what extent the results gained from known automobile-pedestrian impact experiments may be ap- plied to actual accidents, comparisons with the analysis of actual accidents and comparable experiments were made with particular attention to the pattern of damage and the throw distances of the pedestrians. These results produced parameters that should be of additional use in forensic practice for defining the location of collision on the roadway. The injury patterns sustained by pedestrians involved in traffic accidents were related to vehicle damage and classified with respect to impact geometry. From the conclusions drawn from the pedestrians' motions, impact stress, and tolerance, experimental results may well be applied to the reconstruction of actual automobile- pedestrian collisions. However, this is true only within distinct classes of impact geometry, characterized by automobile front-end design, pedestrian size, and impact position. 1974 SA E Transactions 741178. (P-56) Safety Considerations in Design of New Transit Bus Seats. James A. Mateyka and Allen Booz, Applied Research. This paper describes the results of a program to develop advanced cantilevered transit bus seats. The Department of Transportation's Urban Mass Transportation Admin- istration funded the $26 million Transbus Program. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part describes the results of a detailed analysis of passenger accidents on-board current transit buses. The second part describes the results of sled tests that evaluated the safety of three new cantilevered seat/sidewall section designs proposed for Transbus relative to the safety of current transit buses. The testing facilities and procedures are described, along with a summary of the results of 16 sled test runs that employed four different sizes of anthropometric dummies. The results clearly indicate that the new seats have safety characteristics superior to current transit bus seats, especially in severe crash situations. 741179. (P-56) Results of Selected Applications to Actual Highway Accidents of SMAC Reconstruction Program. Ian S. Jones, Calspan Corp. This paper reports the application of the Simulation 184</page><page sequence="144">741179-741183 Model of Automobile Collisions (SMAC) computer program to selected cases of actual highway accidents. Since SMAC was developed to allow accidents to be accurately reconstructed by operators without a detailed knowledge of engineering mechanics, recent developments have concentrated on providing a Start routine. This program automatically generates the inputs required for SMAC, including collision speed estimates, from a minimum amount of information available at the accident scene. A brief summary of how Start works is given, followed by a discussion of actual cases. The sensitivity of the final reconstruction to the various program inputs is discussed; this gives an indication of how the initial Start inputs may be adjusted to obtain a best fit with the minimum number of iterations of the program. Particular emphasis is given to those types of accident that are subject to large errors when reconstructed by the more standard analytical procedures; for example, intersection accidents and accidents involving large spinout trajec- tories. 741180. (P-56) Automotive Collision Fires. Derwyn M. Severy, David M. Blaisdell and John F. Kerk- hoff, Severy Inc. Eight full-scale collision experiments were conducted and 73 collision fire case studies were investigated to provide data relating to fuel system failure modes and suscep- tibility of fuel system designs to collision fires. Data regarding impact speeds, nature of injuries, and climatic conditions are included. Results of extensive laboratory experiments provide specific ignition conditions for common fuels and define ignition hazards of exhaust systems and electrical and lighting circuitry. The physics of crash fire atmospheres is described, including air quality, radiant and convective heat trans- fers, and the relationship between burn physiology and occupant escape time. Design concepts are suggested for limiting fuel spillages, ignition sources, and thermal stress to motorists. 1974 SAE Transactions 741181. (P-56) Three-Point Harness Accident and Lab- oratory Data Comparison. L. M. Patrick, Wayne State University; A. Andersson, AB Volvo; and Nils Bohlin, Volvo-AB Volvo, Car Division. A combined program of accident investigation, staged collisions, and simulated collisions involving three-point harnessed occupants in frontal force collisions has provided a means of correlating injury with forces and/or other physical parameters associated with the injuries. With a strict screening to ensure complete data on each accident, 128 cases involving 169 occupants at barrier equivalent velocities from 2-53 mph were compared with the results from 11 staged collisions and 72 simulated collisions. There were 14 rib cage injuries ranging from single sternum fracture to seven rib fractures at velocities of 10-53 mph at injury levels of AIS 2 and 3. A single AIS 4 injury was the most serious injury and consisted of a ruptured spleen. The most serious brain injury was an AIS 2ě Two cervical vertebra fractures were found, one of which was a 12-year-old male. No abdominal (except the ruptured spleen) organ injuries, thoracic organ injuries, breast injuries, clavicle fracture, or eye injuries were reported, and there were no AIS 5 or fatalities in the sample. It is concluded that: the harness is highly efficient in mitigating injuries, rib and sternum fractures are the more prevalent injuries, submarining is not a major problem, females are injured at lower collision severity than males, and age is an important factor in injury susceptability. The overall tolerance level for 50% injury at the AIS level is 45 mph at an upper shoulder harness load of 1930 lb. a chest Gadd Severity Index of 560, and a peak resultant chest acceleration of 85g. 1974 SAE Transactions 741182. (P-56) Results of 49 Cadaver Tests Simulating Frontal Collision of Front Seat Passengers. Georg Schmidt, Dimitrios Kallieris, Jurgen Barz and Rainer Mattern, University of Heidelberg West Germany. By an acceleration track operated through a falling weight (9,11*) with a crash velocity of 50 km/h and a stopping distance of about 40 cm - corresponding to the crease region of many automobiles - the effect of three- point-retractor belts on 30 fresh cadavers and of two-point belts with kneebar on 19 fresh cadavers had been tested. The age of the cadavers ranged from 12-82 years. Qualitatively, almost all injuries known under the term "seat belt syndrome" could be reproduced. The depen- dence of the degree of injury in regard to the age was quite evident. It can be expected that persons over 40 years of age will suffer the same dangerous injuries as the tested cadavers, caused by the diagonal belts if the above mentioned crash conditions are existent. This will apply to both belt systems tested by us. The shoulder-belt-forces of all of our tests were between 340 kp and 1000 kp; but more serious injuries of the cadavers of older persons could be observed. To reduce the risk of injury, im- provements of the now used restraint systems are necessary. To reach this aim, constructive changes on automobiles and seats have also become necessary to be carried out. 1974 SAE Transactions 741183. (P-56) A Comparison Between Volkswagen Au- tomatic Restraint and Three-Point Automatic Belt on the Basis of Dummy and Cadaver Tests. H. Schimkat and R. Weissner, Volkswagenwerk A.G.; and G. Schmidt, University of Heidelberg. This paper describes the results of 13 tests simulating a frontal impact against a fixed barrier at 50 km/h and 25 g. The results showed a marked increase in the severity of injuries with increasing age and more frequent chest injuries than head and spinal injuries.

(P-56) Effect of Head and Body Position and Muscular Tensing on Response to Impact. Edwin Hendler, Joseph O'Rourke, Marvin Schulman, Mark Katzeff, Leon Domzalski and Stephen Rodgers, Crew Systems Dept. Naval Air Devel- opment Center. Human volunteers were exposed to increasing levels of sled acceleration and velocity during simulated barrier crashes while seated in a padded, bucket automobile seat and restrained by an advanced, passive, three-point belt which contained energy-absorbing fibers and was integral with the seat structure. By muscular tensing, bracing, and riding with the head flexed, two of the subjects were exposed to crash velocities as high as 30.0 mph (over 33 mph, total velocity change), without suffering significant pain or injury. 1974 SAE Transactions 741185. (P-56) Otologic Hazards of Airbag Restraint System. Harry J. Richter, II, R. L. Stalnaker and James E. Pugh, Jr., Dept. of Otorhino- laryngology, University of Michigan Kresge Hearing Research Institute. Since the airbag passive restraint system may be in general use in early 1976, and in fact is now an option on some automobiles, its potential biomedical hazards need to be thoroughly examined. Previous investigations in this area have been extremely limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of local slap pressure of airbag deployment against the external ear and tympanic membrane and to measure its effects on subsequent hearing acuity. Adult and infant squirrel monkeys were used as experimental subjects, because the gross structure of their ear and tympanic membrane closely resembles man's. To create an adequate simulation of the airbag trauma, a small airbag was fabricated and mounted on a pneumatic impact facility. This device was designed to produce a specific velocity to determine the behavior of objects under impact conditions simulating accident kinematics. Cochlear nerve action potentials were measured in both ears of 10 subjects prior to blast, immediately postblast, and several weeks post- blast. High-speed photography recorded the events of the blast, as well as the technique of recording the potential from the cochlea and the appearance of the drumhead pre- and posttrauma. No permanent hearing damage, eardrum perforation, or disruption of ossicles occurred at airbag velocities up to 100 mph and a sound intensity level of 150 dB. 1974 SA E Transactions 741186.

Evans, Neurobiology Dept. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute; Vernon W. Armbrustmacher, Neuropathology Dept., Armed Forces Institute of Pathology; Gary Clark, Pathology Dept., Walter Reed Army Medical Center; and Kenneth M. Earle, Neuro- pathology Dept., Armed Forces Institute. High speed cinefluorographic studies were performed on anesthetized primates during graded, experimental blunt impacts of the head or chest. Cineframe data were analyzed frame by frame to identify dynamic anatomic movement patterns during each injury. The results indicate that the brain and heart undergo significant displacements within the first few milliseconds (ms) post-impact and these transient interior motions were correlated with physiologic and pathologic changes as well as impact force and deceleration. 1974 SA E Transactions 741187. (P-56) Impact Tolerance and Response of the Human Thorax II. Charles K. Kroell and Dennis C. Schneider, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories; and Alan M. Nahum, University Hospital, San Diego. Previous studies of human thoracic injury tolerance and mechanical response to blunt, midsternal, anteroposterior impact loading were reported by the authors at the 1970 SAE International Automobile Safety Conference and at the Fifteenth Stapp Car Crash Conference. The present paper documents additional studies from this continuing research program and provides an expansion and re- finement of the data base established by the earlier work. Twenty-three additional unembalmed cadavers were tested using basically the same equipment and procedures reported previously, but for which the new combinations of impactor mass and velocity were used in addition to supplementing other data already presented. Specifically, the 43 lb/ 11 mph (19.5kg/4.9 m/s) and 51 lb/ 16 mpgh (23.1 kg/7.2 m/s) conditions were intercrossed and data obtained at 43 lb/ 16 mph (19.5 kg/7.2 m/s) and 51 lb/ 11 mph (23.1 kg/4.9 m/s). Several additional tests were run at 22 mph (9.8 m/s) and confirm a strong velocity sensitivity of the force response throughout the velocity range investigated. Also included are several tests in which the cadaver subjects were rigidly supported midsagittally along the spine to preclude whole body motion. Finally, the kinematics of thoracic compression under blunt, A-P impact have been demonstrated by high-speed cine- matography of a thorax unilaterally denuded of skin and superficial tissues to enable visualization of the rib surfaces and intercostal musculature during loading. Response in terms of force-time and deflection-time histories and force versus deflection crossplots, and tolerance in terms of associated necropsy findings and AIS ratings, are presented for all tests. Correlations of the AIS rating with both maximum force and normalized chest deflection, several composite summary plots, and a general data tabulation are also included. 1974 SAE Transactions 186</page><page sequence="146">741188-741192 741188. (P-56) Analysis of Chest Impact Response Data and Scaled Performance Recommendations. Ray- mond F. Neathery, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. The chest impact data of Kroell, et al., and Stalnaker, et al., were examined to determine the relationships that might exist between the physical characteristics of cadav- ers, impact conditions, and responses. It was found that while the Kroell male, Kroell female, and Stalnaker data had similar physical characteristics and impact conditions in the same manner. Regression equations were found that fit the Kroell male data extremely well. Based on a regression analysis of the Kroell male data, scaling rules were developed that allowed performance requirements for chest response to be defined for 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummies. Previous response requirements were for 50th percentile dummies only and were based on averaged responses from subjects whose average char- acteristics differed widely from 50th percentile charac- teristics. Currently recommended response corridors based on an extended data base are presented in the Addendum. The extended data base includes new data being concur- rently published. These additional data produce a few minor changes in the response corridors, while improving their statistical significance. 1974 SA E Transactions 741189. (P-56) Static Force-Penetration Response of the Human Knee. Dr. Gerald W. Nyquist, Bio- medical Science Dept., General Motors Re- search Laboratories. Biomechanical guidelines for the development of an anthropometric dummy knee have been lacking. Quasi- static tests were performed on adult male volunteers and embalmed cadavers to define the force-penetration char- acteristics of the knee when loaded by a rigid, crushable foam of known crush properties. The test subject was seated erect with the thigh horizontal and lower leg unrestrained. Axial thigh (femur) force and knee penetration were recorded as a block of foam was pressed against the knee. The test was con- ducted incrementally with increasing peak load, and a new foam block was used for each increment. This enabled evaluation of the foam indent volume as a function of peak load. Pertinent anthropometric data are presented for each subject, and normal distribution theory is used to develop percentile scaling rules for the knee response. Loading corridors for biomechanically sound 50th percentile performance are suggested. 1974 SA E Transactions 741190. (P-56) Investigation of Femur Response to Longitudinal Impact. William R. Powell, Sunder H. Advani, Robert N. Clark, Steven J. Ojala and Daniel J. Holt, West Virginia University. Longitudinal impact tests were conducted on the knees of four seated embalmed cadavers using an impact pen- dulum. Impact force and femur strain histories were recorded, and peak force at fracture was determined. The results show that femur stiffness (average = 3.29 MN) for impacts is nearly the same as for static loads. Peak fracture loads varied from 8731-11570 N, all above the fracture criterion proposed by King, Fan and Vargovick. Strain histories and fracture patterns suggest that bending effects play a major role in determining the response of embalmed cadaver femurs to longitudinal impact. 1974 SA E Transactions 741191. . (P-56) Mathematical Model for Closed Head Impact. Han Sun Chan, General Motors Re- search Laboratories. In order to understand better the head injury mechanism and to clarify the unsettled question as to whether the shear strain or the reduced pressure is the primary injury etiology during a given impact, a realistic model should be devised. The approach to such a realistic but complicated boundary value problem in biomechanics is achieved through the application of the finite element method. By use of the finite element displacement formulation the human head is modeled as a viscoelastic core bonded to a thin viscoelastic shell, which simulates the brain and the skull, respectively. For purpose of comparison, two configurations - a spherical shape and a prolate ellipsoid - have been used to describe the geometry of the human head. By applying an impact load over a small area of the shell, the head injury mechanisms-such as cavitation, caused by excessive tensile stress, and rotation, produced by large shear strain - along with their possible damage locations, are simulated. Linear viscoelastic properties are assumed for both the core material and the shell. The equations of motion for the problem are in the form of second-order matrix differential equations. Solutions are obtained through the matrix iterative method. 1974 SAE Transactions 741192. (P-56) Simulation of Head Injury Due to Com- bined Rotation and Translation of the Brain. Nabih M. Alem, Highway Safety Research Institute, the University of Michigan. This paper describes a mathematical model for head injury prediction based on the hypothesis that injury results from a combination of displacement and rotation of the brain inside the skull. The model is a 12-degrees-of-freedom mechanical system consisting of masses, dashpots, and springs. The classical Lagrange's method is used in formulating the equations of motion. Numerical integration is used to obtain their solution. Constants for the elements of the model are obtained from published experimental measurements. Other lumped parameters which have not yet been measured are determined by adjusting them until a satisfactory agree- ment is obtained between the model's response and 187</page><page sequence="147">741192-741206 equivalent measured responses. The frequency and time responses of the model, for a variety of loading conditions, are studied. Results show a good agreement between experimentally observed and mathematically generated responses. Quantitative vali- dation of some responses was prevented for the lack of experimental measurements. Nevertheless, the model provides a way of using multiple injury criteria to estimate the injury potential of severe impact environments. 1974 SA E Transactions 741193. (P-56) Definition and Development of a Crash Dummy Head. Robert P. Hubbard and Donald G. McLeod, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. Crash test dummies serve as human surrogates in automotive crash simulations, and accelerations mon- itored in the heads of these dummies are used for assessment of human head injury hazard. For these acceleration measurements to be meaningful indicators of head injury, the impact response of the human head must be a part of dummy head design. This paper describes the conception, design and development of a crash test dummy head. Geometric, inertial, and performance requirements based on bio- mechanical information are presented and discussed. The head design concept is compatible with current head injury assessment procedures, and the configuration is based on the GM Research skull and head geometry models. The manufacture and development are described, and the test procedures and results are presented and discussed with reference to the biomechanical and functional requirements. The resulting dummy head is shown to comply with these requirements. 741194. (P-56) Efficiency of Phantom Impact Test in Safety Glass Testing. A. Slattenschek, W. Tauf- fkirchen and G. Benedikter, Technical Test and Research Department Vienna Institute of Tech- nology. For investigating the safety of passengers impacting windshields, above all in test series in the development of new glass constructions, the phantom test is practically indispensable. But since the evaluation values for internal safety-head acceleration and lacerations-can only be properly measured when the movement carried out at impact is realistic, the tests must be carried out at the impact angles occurring in motor vehicles. The results of the phantom test depend largely on the construction of the phantom head. Due to the use of phantom heads of varying construction (because of lack of test regulations), the results of the individual testing installations frequently deviate from one another. In a test series with HPR safety glass (2.0/2.8/0.76 mm flat panes of 24 X 36 in), the effect of several parameters (head mass and head spring suspension, head freely movable or head guided on evaluation values for resultant head acceler- ation. Severity Index, Head Impact Criterion, tolerance value, and Laceration index) was investigated. The test series were carried out at impact angles of = 45,60, and 90 deg at rates of 20-50 km/h. The results, supplemented by motion analysis of the impact process, were compared to the results of sled tests with test dummies previously been used by other testing installations on similar glass constructions and under comparable test conditions. 741195. (P-56) The MVMA Two-Dimensional Crash Victim Simulation. D. H. Robbins, B. M. Bowman and R. O. Bennett, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. This paper presents the various features and operational properties of a two-dimensional mathematical model of crash victim motions. The earliest forms of this model can be traced to the early 1960s. Developmental work on two-dimensional models then continued both within the automotive industry and in independent organizations such as the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI). The most recent product of this activity is the MVMA two-dimensional mathematical crash victim simulation developed at HSRI for the Motor Vehicle Manufactures Association. The features of this model include: 1. An eight mass representation of the human body where contact between the crash victim and the vehicle is represented in terms of independent force-deformation properties of the victim and the vehicle. 2. An extensible multi-joint neck and a realistically flexible shoulder joint. 3. A real-line representation of the vehicle interior or exterior where shape is given as a network of points. 4. Specific predictive restraint device submodels for the airbag, the energy absorbing steering column, and a slipping, energy absorbing three-point-belt restraint sys- tem. 5. A flexible output package including graphics, an injury criteria monitor, and a variety of options for listing, deleting, and comparing selected output variables. Func- tional properties of the model and potential applications are demonstrated in the paper by examples. 741206. A Progress Report on Curtiss- Wright's Rotary Stratified Charge Engine Development. Charles Jones, Curtiss- Wright Corp. Development progress of the direct injected Stratified Charge Rotary engine program at Curtiss- Wright is detailed. Basic configurations are described and compared to both reciprocating stratified charge engines and the carbureted Rotary engine. Data and theoretical analyses are presented for progressive developments from initial feasibility testing in 1962 through current configurations now on test. It is concluded that the Stratified Charge Rotary Engine research efforts to date have demonstrated potential for an efficient, lightweight, compact, economic powerplant capable of broad range operations justifying further research efforts. 188</page><page sequence="148">741208-741219 741208.

Whitley, AMP Inc. Whether we like it or not, increased usage of automotive electronics is going to focus attention on a class of components which may have little glamour or exotic appeal, but which will assume a role of vital and critical importance in tomorrow's automobile - the electrical connector. Though we may think of them as simple hardware, electrical connectors and interconnecting de- vices have reached a surprisingly high level of sophis- tication. This paper reviews the basic physics of electric contacts, with the objective of demonstrating how an understanding of the fundamental phenomena governing the behavior of electric contacts can be useful not only to designers and manufacturers, but also to users of electrical connectors. Items to be covered include: the origin and signif- icance of contact resistance, the influence of material properties on contact performance, the selection of platings or other protective coatings for connector contacts, the current-carrying capacity of contacts, and the effects of film and contaminates in contacts. The correlation of theory and experiment will be illustrated with graphs of typical laboratory experimental data. Relative to the usage of electrical connectors in automotive electronics, it will be shown that much of the technology which exists and was developed in and for other industries will be applicable, if properly understood and utilized, in the automotive industry. But new, specific, and unique problems relating to connector requirements and application will be encountered in automotive electronics, and our best chance of solving them is to acquire an appreciation of basic connector fundamentals as discussed in this paper. 1974 SA E Transactions 741217. (P-57) Electronic Fuel Management - Practical or Presumptuous? William L. Miron, The Bendix Corp. This presents an examination of the state of electronics in automotive industry. It explores the question of whether electronics is practical or presumptuous more from an economic standpoint than from a purely technical stand- point. It concentrates attention on fuel management system. It looks at disadvantages and advantages to assess the practicality of electronics in fuel management. The conclusions reached are 1) Electronics are a practical solution to the many problems of automotive industry based on assessment of the situation regarding fuel management. 2) Electronics offers an extremely practical answer to not only most of the fuel control problems of the automobile, but many other automotive control requirements as well. 741218. (P-57) The State of the Art of Solid State Memories and Microprocessors. Robert N. Noyce and William H. Davidow, Intel Corp. Improvements in cost or performance of an order of magnitude are occurring in the technology available to make small computers. This is occurring both in the processing unit with the microprocessor, and in the memories supporting the processor. As cost/performance is improved, the computer can be dedicated to more mundane tasks, such as carburetor control, while already being used in traffic light control. This development, permitting the use of arbitrarily large amounts of intelligence at low cost makes electronics capable of performing control functions formerly done with me- chanical or hydraulic systems. 741219. (P-57) A Reliability Assessment of Automotive Electronics. Dr. C. Gordon Peattie, Texas In- struments Incorporated. Electronic reliability, as related to the automotive system, is discussed in four parts: the dual requirements of high reliability and of low unit price imposed on the semi- conductor industry by the automotive system; how semiconductor device reliability has been and is being raised to levels of reliability commensurate with the needs of the automotive system; some suggestions as to how the semiconductor industry and the automobile industry might work together most effectively; and the overall situation as the semiconductor industry sees it. The automobile system represents a stringent envi- ronmental requirement for semiconductor devises. Reli- ability-wise, the requirements are not too different from those of military- and space-use situations. The auto- mobile system imposes on the semiconductor industry two diverging requirements. One is a rigorous level of device reliability and the other is a demandingly competitive price figure. Reliability data is shown for discrete devices (tran- sistors, power devices) and for integrated circuits. These data show that semiconductor devices have adequate reliability at present for use in automobile systems. Field performance data are given for two specific applications of Texas Instruments electronics to the automobile system - the skid-control module and the seatbelt-interlock module. From April 1970 to January 1973, Texas Instruments supplied skid-control modules to 189</page><page sequence="149">741219-741225 a segment of the automobile industry. On a data base of 229,000 units, only 14 returns are known to have been made for electronic defects. This is a reliability per- formance of 99.9925%. Texas Instruments has been supplying seatbelt-inter- lock modules for use in certain automobiles for about a year. Customer's reliability goal for the first year's production was 99.00%. During ten months' use in the field, the reliability of this module was 99.95%. The triple characteristics of semiconductor failures with time are: early failures, random failures, and wearout failures. Overall reliability can be increased by use of test screens to remove early failures. Wearout failures have been seen only in testing, not in field use. Two points should be made with regard to semi- conductor reliability. One is the steady increase in the reliability of semiconductor devices over the years. The second is that step-function gains in reliability will be made when process technologies, now restricted to manufacture of ultrahigh reliability devices, can be made sufficiently economical to be used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices for the automobile industry. 741220.

The statement is made that to enjoy the fullest potential benefits of MOS, in terms of costs, features and per- formance, MOS should be approached, not in the context of a conventional "component", but as a "custom sub-system" for the automobile. Advantages and the two major categories of MOS/LSI are both presented. Criteria for selecting custom MOS, one of the categories of MOS, is also presented, along with some corresponding do's and don'ts for the implemen- tation of a successful program. 741221.

(P-57) Application of Electronics to Fuel Man- agement and Emission Systems: Electronic Fuel Injection in Europe. Hermann Eisele, Robert Bosch GMBH. Recent development effort concentrated on further improvement of emission control and fuel economy. The Bosch electronic fuel injection was advanced from using absolute intake manifold pressure as main input variable to an air metering system. This approach simplifies emission control combined with less cost gained by other improvements. Better fuel economy in combination with low emis- sions is achieved by closed-loop control employing the A-sensor. The structure of this control loop allows the application of a self-adaptive control system responding to changing operating conditions of the engine. A further possibility is the closed-loop control at air-fuel ratios slightly richer or leaner than stoichiometric. This appli- cation widens the use of the A-sensor to different emission control packages dependent on applicable standards. 741224. (P-57) Electronic Fuel Injection in the U.S.A. Jerome G.

The advantages of feedback control are discussed with emphasis on the need for low-cost durable sensors. EFI is compared to the carburetor and other competitive systems in terms of cost, fuel control accuracy, and fuel economy.

(P-57) A Long-Range Look at Semiconductor Development and its Impact on Automotive Electronics. B. V. Vonderschmitt, RCA Solid State. To ensure cost-effectiveness, automotive industry solid- state device requirements, a small percentage of total U.S. consumption, will be met through custom designs using technologies applicable to non-automotive applications as well. N-MOS and complementary-MOS technologies with their cost and performance advantages and smaller size will prevail in digital signal processing; bipolar IC's plus IC's combining bipolar and MOS technologies on the same chip will be used for linear signal processing. Multiple-epitaxial structured silicon power devices will be used as actuator drivers. The reliability/cost equation will be solved by using buffered power sources to permit use of custom-designed low-voltage IC signal-processing circuits. Power devices having device characteristics that can withstand the high voltage transients will provide the interface between the low-level signal processing and actuator drivers. As the number of applications increases, both power devices and IC's will be packaged in plastic packages as operating environments permit and basic die-construction improvements are effected. 1974 SAE Transactions 741229.

Two specific areas are covered: 1) What electronics are capable of doing on cost/function basis. 2) How to solve sensor interface problems. The discussion also covers considerations of voltage, temperature, reliability and ability to perform multiple roles.
