<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introductory ornithology.-George E. Grube. 1964. Dubuque, Iowa, Wm. C. Brown. Pp. x + 294, illus., 61/4 X 9 in. $4.75.-According to the author's introduction "This book is meant to be, as the title implies, an introduction to the field. It is not meant as a source book for the graduate or research ornithologist. Yet the text attempts to treat all major phases in the study of birds." I take this to mean that the book is designed for undergraduate courses in ornithology. How well suited, then, is it for this stated purpose? In my opinion, not well at all. The text has 15 chapters of about 10 or so pages each. There is a conventional division of subject matter into such chapter topics as Internal Anatomy, Migration, Life History (two chapters), and the like. Most chapters have a list of references and one or more suggested laboratory exercises at the end.</page><page sequence="2">Oct.] Reviews 687 166 I find two major faults with the text. First, too much space is given to definitions of technical terms and too little to discussions of imporant topics such as behavior, physiology, etc. To be useful a text may either set forth problems for discussion and permit the instructor to provide details, or furnish details and allow the instructor freedom to elucidate problems, without having to recite facts. Most texts usually do some of both. This text presents neither data nor problems nearly as well as several others on the market (Welty, for instance). For example, less space is de- voted to descriptions and analyses of pair formation than to definitions of nest types. About the same space is devoted to molts and plumages (separated in two chapters) as to definitions of toe arrangement and tarsal scaling. As much space is spent discussing Yeagley's unsuccessful experiments on orientation (magnetic lines of force, etc.) as is devoted to present day research on orientation. Only Kramer's work is mentioned briefly with reference to solar or celestial orientation. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the text is its generally low intellectual level. Any college freshman with a fair high school biology course would be dis- contented with the superficial approach of this text. Presumably, ornithology would be given to juniors and seniors, even more sophisticated, who would not appreciate a definition of genes as " . . . structures situated in the chromosomes of cells." The lack of depth may have been dictated partly by space limitations; of 294 pages only 177 are text, while 177 pages contain keys, laboratory exercises, and references. Space limitations cannot, however, account for the abundance of anthropomorphic and teleological statements, nor for ambiguous phrases. Here are a couple of examples of the general style: "Females of most species apparently select the territory which is to their liking, while the male that claims that territory is incidental (p. 110)." And: "Courtship begins after the female has selected her mate or her territory, or while she is in the process of doing so (p. 111)." Most references given are pre-1955, and none is to foreign language literature. Following the text is a 24-page key to families of birds, better than many, but still with the usual ambiguous terms. I think most keys are a waste of time because they do not emphasize true taxonomic or significant biological characteristics. If we must have a key, why not let the students make their own? They'll get much more out of it than keying out a specimen probably identified already via a field guide. A good 75 pages consists of sheets for laboratory work. The student is asked to make a synopsis of characteristics and plot the distribution of each family listed, sheer busy work if, as in the key, the characters listed are not those of taxonomic value. As elsewhere, the student is not challenged to do more than copy work. Another disappointment is an appendix suggesting topics for undergraduate re- search (the dust jacket features this as a novel aspect of the text). I admire the attempt to lead the undergraduate into individual research but I believe this part of the text does not lead him far enough. All but 2 of 22 suggested problems are descriptive. Why so few experimental investigations? Even challenging territorial males with taped playbacks would expose the student to more of the intellectual ferment of current research than counting singing males or determining the composi- tion of phoebe nests. To his credit, the author does suggest a literature search before starting a problem, but if the student took the studies listed as representative of the kinds of questions being asked in research today, it would require some effort to correct him. The illustrations (by W. C. Dilger) are well executed but, because of the demands of the text, are pictures of things rather than illustrations of processes.</page><page sequence="3">688 Reviews [ Auk I Vol. 83 In short, I think that as a teaching text this work lacks sufficient information to free the instructor from regurgitative lectures. Too much space is given to trivia, and the text is often ambiguous and misleading. Ornithology is not presented as a viable science contributing to modern biological theory.-JEFF SWINEBROAD.</page></plain_text>
