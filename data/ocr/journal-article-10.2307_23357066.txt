<plain_text><page sequence="1">German Jewish Scholarship on Islam as a Tool for De-Orientalizing Judaism Susannah Heschel During the nineteenth century, a Jewish Orientalism arose that sought the elevation of Islam as a rational religion with an intimate relationship to Juda ism. In their studies of the Quran, in particular, European Jewish scholars, from the 1830s to the 1930s, helped shape the field of Islamic studies, and in the surveys of Jewish history and theology written for popular audiences Islam came to function as a template for presenting some of Judaism's cen tral religious claims to a European readership. European Jews were fasci nated by Islam and praised its monotheism, rationalism, openness to science and philosophy, rejection of anthropomorphism, and adherence to a religious law based in ethics. In doing so, European Jews aligned Islam with Judaism in opposition to Christianity. Jewish historians contrasted the tolerance afforded Jews in Muslim Spain to the sufferings of Jews in medieval Chris tian Europe and praised Islamic rationalism and toleration for allowing Jews and Judaism to flourish. This Jewish discourse was a different kind of "Ori entalism," one that imagined an Enlightened Islam and that used it as a vehicle to insist on a "purified," rational Judaism. In other words, Islam in the Euro pean Jewish context was a tool for de-Orientalizing Judaism. Edward W. Said's elucidation of a European Orientalist discourse has long been criticized for focusing on Britain and France, to the exclusion of Germany, where the academic study of Islam, in particular, flourished during New German Critique 117, Vol. 39, No. 3, Fall 2012 DOI 10.1215/0094033X-1677282 © 2012 by New German Critique, Inc. 91</page><page sequence="2">92 German Jewish Scholarship on Islam the long nineteenth century. Said also ignored the Orientalist scholarship that was also pursued farther east, primarily in Austria, Hungary, Russia, and the Balkans, where studies of Islam were inflected by political concerns over mil itary threats from the Ottoman Empire and central Asia.1 The proximity to Islamicate territories created what the anthropologist Andre Gingrich has termed a "frontier Orientalism" in Austria and the Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova has called "nesting Balkanisms" in relation to Europe.2 Nationalist and imperialist interests certainly played a major role in European scholarship. Hungarian Orientalism, for example, was concerned with Turkic studies partly to determine the origins of Magyar linguistic roots and cultural affinities. Yet Orientalism also operated under theological, not only political, motivations. Suzanne Marchand has argued that the search for Christianity's roots played an important role in German scholars' study of the ancient Near East as well as of Iranian and Indian religions, because they hoped to uncover an alternative to a Jewish setting for Christian origins. Islam was of less interest in Germany, she argues, because it arose after Christianity had already been established.3 By contrast, Jewish scholars in Oriental studies in Europe, at least until the early twentieth century, focused almost exclusively on the study of Islam, with only minimal interest in China, India, Iran, and the ancient Near East. As Marchand, Bernard Lewis, Martin Kramer, and others have noted, a Jew ish "discovery of Islam" led to scholarly and popular works that spoke in highly positive terms about Islamic theological principles, medieval explora tions of science and philosophy, and, in particular, a Jewish "golden age" under Muslim rule in medieval Spain.4 The distinctiveness of Jewish schol arship, Lewis has pointed out, was that "the Jewish scholar, unlike many of his Christian colleagues, had no missionary ambitions, no nostalgia for the Crusades, no concern with the Eastern question. He was free from the inher 1. Edward W. Said, Orientalism (New York: Pantheon. 1978).

Their work set an agenda for scholarship that has lasted until today and that also left a footprint in Islamicate cultures. From 1833 until 1933 Jewish scholars, particularly in Germany, Hun gary, and France, created a significant body of research on the origins of Islam, the biography of the prophet Muhammad, and Jewish influences on the Qur'an as well as on the Hadith (the traditions about the prophet Muhammad). Some European Jews traveled to Islamicate countries and established relationships with colleagues and students there, and some wrote travelogues for Euro pean readers. A few converted to Islam, while others perhaps feigned conver sion; Islam became a tool for disguise, both in Europe and in the East. Linking scholars with popular writers are an appreciation for Islam and an assumption that Judaism and Islam share central religious convictions and structures. Their work calls attention to unnoticed aspects of modern Judaism and Jew ish self-understanding. The First Generation: Abraham Geiger's Study of the Qur'an The modern Jewish fascination with Islam began in the 1830s with a small group of Jewish students at the University of Bonn, studying under Georg Frey tag, professor of Arabic studies at Bonn since 1819 and a student of Antoine de Sacy.6 These students, all male (Jewish women had to wait until the 1890s), came from Orthodox Jewish families and were well versed in Hebrew, Tal mud, and medieval Jewish commentaries.7 Several of Abraham Geiger's fel low Jewish students at Bonn thought of becoming rabbis; in those days, Bonn "seemed to be truly a Hochschule for Jewish theologians."8 Lacking a rabbinic 5.

Most of them became scholars: Lud wig Ullmann translated the Qur'an into modern German, published in 1840; Salomon Munk became the leading scholar of medieval Arabic Jewish phi losophy; Joseph Derenbourg, initially a scholar of Second Temple-era Juda ism, later turned to Jewish history under Islam; and Abraham Geiger wrote a prizewinning essay, "Was hat Muhammad aus dem Judenthume aufgenom men?," that inaugurated a new way to understand the origins of Islam within Judaism by demonstrating parallels in Qur'anic understandings of the Bible and of the Midrash. Another Jewish student of that generation who became a scholar of Islam was Gustav Weil, who studied in Heidelberg and Paris, then spent five years in Algiers, Cairo, and Istanbul, studying and teaching, before returning to Heidelberg, where he completed his Habilitation in 1836 and became an assistant librarian. After years of scholarly publications and requests for a professorship at the University of Heidelberg, he ultimately received a chair in Oriental studies in 1861.9 Geiger's essay, published as a book in 1833, was hailed all over Europe.10 Reinhard Dozy, Heinrich Ewald, Heinrich Lebrecht Fleischer, Ignaz Goldzi her, Theodor Noeldeke, and Sacy were among the many scholars who praised it as "epoch-making" (Noeldeke). Indeed, Geiger set a pattern followed by numerous other Jewish scholars, such as Victor Aptowitzer, Isaac Gastfreund, Hartwig Hirschfeld, Josef Horovitz, Abraham Katsch, Eugen Mittwoch, Israel Schapiro, Martin Schreiner, David Sidersky, and Gustav Weil, who sought to demonstrate rabbinic parallels with early Islamic texts and Judaism's influence in shaping Islamic belief, ritual practice, and law. The narrative was repeated from the 1830s to the 1930s with little variation, although the tone changed somewhat and the repetitive quality of the narrative had taken on a different nuance by the early twentieth century. Geiger was remarkably sympathetic to Islam: Muhammad was a genu ine religious enthusiast, not a seducer or fraud or epileptic. Besides writing the Qur'an, he recognized the Pentateuch as a book of law and Moses as a law giver; he adopted many Jewish teachings but also inverted some of them. He 9.

Geiger noted remarkable parallels with the Mishnah, which he acknowledged might have also passed to Islam via Christianity: the seven heavens, mentioned in the Qur'an in a few places, come from Mishnah Hagigah 9:2; seven hells, from Eruvin 19:1; those who built the tower of Babel will be annihilated by a poisonous wind (Sura 11:63), or will have no place in the next world, from Mishnah Sanhédrin 10:3; and so forth. Legal reasoning also shows parallels: all commandments are of equal value, but what if a par ent, whom we are commanded to honor, tells us to violate a commandment? Both the Talmud (Yebamot 6) and Muhammad (Sura 29:7) pose the problem and respond similarly. Purification before prayer is required by both, and how to pray is specified. "Pronounce not thy prayer aloud, neither pronounce it with too low a voice, but follow a middle way between these," Muhammad enjoins (Sura 17:110); the Talmud says, "From the behavior of Hannah who in prayer moved her lips we learn that he who prays must pronounce the words, and ... not raise his voice loudly" (Berachot 31:2). Geiger insisted that the Qur'an was not the product of Christian heretics teaching Muhammad falsehoods about biblical narratives, as most Christians through the centuries had claimed (with the exception of Peter the Venerable, who blamed Judaism for producing Islam), but that Islam arose as a vehicle for bringing Jewish monotheism to the pagan Arabs. Islam was born of Judaism, and Muhammad, whom Geiger describes in very positive terms, while con vinced of his divine mission, mainly wanted to align his teachings with those of the biblical prophets. Geiger's construction of Islamic origins is simultaneously a study of Judaism; that is also true of the other Jewish scholars who engaged in com parative studies of Islam. For Geiger, Islam was assembled from the build ing blocks of Jewish ideas and religious practices. By contrast, he argues, Jews possess a "religious genius" and Judaism is a powerful, original religious impulse able to generate offshoots appropriate to primitive cultural settings without losing its essential characteristics and the purity of its teachings. Both Islam and Christianity are little more than Jewish monotheism brought to the pagan world, though Islam managed to preserve a strict monotheism, whereas Christianity corrupted its theology with pagan ideas, as Geiger sub sequently argued in a series of books and articles published in the 1860s and 1870s prior to his death in 1874. Both Geiger and Weil brought historicist sensibilities to their philological work. In contrast to other Arabists of their day, including Sacy, Freytag, and Fleischer, they were less interested in linguistic analysis of Arabic and instead</page><page sequence="6">96 German Jewish Scholarship on Islam read texts for evidence of historical data. Weil, for example, concentrated on the sira traditions, that is, biographies of the prophet Muhammed, to reconstruct the history of the early Islamic movement. Geiger examined the Qur'an for historical evidence of religious and political conflicts, but for him the Qur'an was a single unit, whereas Weil constructed a chronological sequence in the suras to establish even more precise developments that the text reflects. Both Weil and Geiger stressed the affinities between Judaism and Islam, though Weil went a step farther, presenting Islam as superior to both Judaism and Christianity. For Geiger, Islam was a branch of Judaism, and Muhammad was a genuine religious enthusiast. In Weil's account, Islam was a purified ver sion of both Judaism and Christianity: "A Judaism without the many ritual and ceremonial laws, which, according to Mohamed's declaration, even Christ had been called to abolish, or a Christianity without the Trinity, crucifixion and salvation connected therewith"—that is, Weil constructed Islam after the image of religion of his day: Judaism without law, Christianity without dogma; Islam was the Enlightenment religion.11 By contrast, the 1861 multivolume Life of Mohammad, by the Austrian scholar Aloys Sprenger, presents Muhammad as weak, cunning, and prone to hysterical frenzy. Weil became quickly known throughout Europe for his publications, which were both scholarly and popular. Indeed, Benjamin Disraeli, in his 1844 novel, Coningsby, has one of his characters speak in praise of a Jewish professor of Arabic at Heidelberg named "Wehl." Strikingly, Disraeli incorrectly attributes a professorship to Weil and claims that Jewish professors dominated Oriental studies in Germany, which was certainly not the case until many decades later: You never observe a great intellectual movement in Europe in which the Jews do not greatly participate. . . . Wehl, the Arabic Professor of Heidel berg, is a Jew. Years ago, when I was in Palestine, I met a German student who was accumulating materials for the History of Christianity, and study ing the genius of the place; a modest and learned man. It was Wehl; then unknown, since become the first Arabic scholar of the day, and the author of the life of Mahomet. But for the German professors of this race, their name is Legion. I think there are more than ten at Berlin alone.12 Weil's scholarship on Islam was prolific.

Weil worked primarily with Arabic manuscripts that had been gathered for the ducal library in Gotha by an adventurer, Ulrich Jasper Seetzen (1767-1811); in 1826 Johann Moeller published a catalog of the library's col lection of Arab manuscripts. The Next Generation The study of Islam was in its infancy in the 1830s in Germany; dictionaries, critical editions of texts, and methods for analyzing them had yet to be devel oped. As Geiger wrote, his analysis of the Qur'an was based simply on the "naked Arabic text." Fleischer, who became professor of Oriental languages at the University of Leipzig in 1835, had, like Freytag, trained under Sacy in France, where scholars were busy analyzing the treasure trove of documents that Napoléon's scholars had brought back from Middle East expeditions.13 Bonn remained a smaller center than Leipzig for studying Islam; in Leipzig, Fleischer had over three hundred students, Jews and Christians, and of the 131 dissertations he directed prior to his death in 1886, 51 were written by Jews, including Wilhelm Bacher, Eduard Baneth, Daniel Chwolsohn, Morris Jastrow, Immanuel Loew, and Goldziher, whom Fleischer considered his greatest student.14 Fleischer was also the founding editor of the Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenlandischen Gesellschaft and welcomed contributions by Jews, making his journal one of the only prestigious German academic journals on religion in which Jews were permitted to publish their scholar ship, and creating Islamic studies as a particularly welcoming field for Jew ish scholars. During the second half of the nineteenth century, some Jewish scholars were also inaugurating contacts with the Muslim world. Among the non Jews, Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, Alfred von Kremer, and Sprenger spent time in Muslim countries. But the last decades of the century show a new development.

The controversies over historicist approaches to Islamic texts limited the impact of Goldziher's work in Egypt, as of other European historians.17 The Jewish scholars and theologians who admired Islam stood in sharp contrast with some of the major Christian scholars of Islam in Germany of the same era. Julius Wellhausen, for example, transferred traditional Christian theological denigrations of Judaism to his evaluation of Islam. C. H. Becker situated the origins of Islam within Hellenism, not Judaism.18 Wellhausen, in switching his scholarship from the Old Testament to Islam in the 1880s, intended, he wrote, "to learn about the wild stock upon which the shoot of Yahwe's Tora was grafted by the priests and the prophets."19 What he hoped to find, van Ess explains, "was religiosity without priests and prophets, that is, without the Law and without institutions."20 Wellhausen was looking for lib eral Protestantism, purged of Judaism. For him, the era of classical prophecy 15. Josef van Ess, "Goldziher as a Contemporary of Islamic Reform," in Goldziher Memorial Conference, ed.

Similarly, Becker assumed a dichotomy between subjective religiosity and institutionalized religion—an implied dichotomy between Protestantism and Judaism. Van Ess writes, "In his [Wellhausen's] view, the shari'a fosters conservatism and makes progress impossible; its ide alistic character makes those who are subject to it despair of adequate accom plishment and thus favors their indolence."21 In the entire corpus of scholarship on Islam, Goldziher (1850-1921) stands as a singular figure. His work, wide-ranging, profound, and influential, served as a link between the methods of the Wissenschaft des Judentums, especially as developed by Geiger, and the study of early Islamic religious texts. Moreover, Goldziher, not only a philologist but also a protophenomenol ogist of religion, asked how Muhammad experienced being a prophet. Goldziher's study of the Hadith, Muhammadanische Studien, argues that these traditions are not really authentic teachings of Muhammad but reflect later arguments of central importance to Muslims: "Minute study soon reveals the presence of the tendencies and aspirations of a later day, the work ing of a spirit which wrests the record in favour of one or the other of the opposing theses in certain disputed questions."22 Isnads (chains of tradition) were used to legitimate later teachings by projecting them into the past. Gold ziher's Muslims were like the rabbis of Judaism's rabbinic tradition, who attributed their teachings to noted rabbis of earlier eras and who modified their rulings in accordance with the political and social and economic environment of the Jews: Goldziher emphasized that even Muhammad had to adapt his teachings to the circumstances of the Arabs to whom he was preaching. Reli gious practice was malleable, and interpretations of the Qur'an were bound to vary in different eras, a sign of the religion's vitality—the same argument Goldziher made with regard to Judaism in his earlier study of the Midrash, Hebrew Myths, published in 1876. Geiger was the crucial influence in how Goldziher looked at historical sources. From Geiger, he learned that sources reveal little that is reliable about the event described, but much about how that event was perceived in later 21. Ibid., 43. 22.

Margoliouth, a contemporary of Goldziher's and professor of Arabic at Oxford University, took the argument even farther, as did Henri Lammens and Joseph Schacht.</page><page sequence="10">100 German Jewish Scholarship on Islam times. This, of course, was precisely the argument that got Geiger into so much trouble with his claims about the New Testament as an inadequate source for the life of Jesus. Here he was following the Tubingen School, whose consequences resulted in the academic excommunication of David Friedrich Strauss for his 1835 Life of Jesus. Not to know reliably about the details of Jesus's life because the gospels were mythic constructions was one kind of heresy; to claim that Jesus can be best understood in the context of rabbinic literature, the Mishnah, Tosefta, Targumim, and Talmud, as Geiger claimed, was an outrage to Protestant theologians. Historicism was one kind of prob lem; claiming that Jesus was a Pharisee, the Leipzig philo-Semitic Protes tant theologian Franz Delitzsch wrote, was "ten times more horrific than the crucifixion."23 On the question of Jewish influence in shaping Islam, Goldziher echoed Jewish denials of Islamic originality: Islam contains "practically nothing original"; "Muhammad did not proclaim new ideas"; "Muhammad's teaching was not the original creation of his genius . . . but all his doctrines are taken from Judaism and Christianity"; Islam "was the most important manifestation of the Semitic genius ever made."24 Goldziher intended such denials of Islamic originality not to disparage Islam but to demonstrate its vitality—and also that of Judaism. Writing against the Semitic philologist Ernst Renan, who viewed both Islam and Judaism as stagnant Semitic reli gions, incapable of development and lacking mythology, Goldziher argued that Islam, like Judaism, has a receptive nature, a capacity to assimilate for eign ideas and rituals and to adapt itself to changing circumstances. Freed of the matrix of mythology, Judaism and Islam raised themselves to monothe ism, which allowed them to inaugurate a history of scientific understand ing.25 Such arguments were also directed against the rigid Orthodox rabbis of Hungary, whom Goldziher had already attacked in his very first publica tion, a small pamphlet, privately printed, that he wrote at twelve, in 1862, and that earned him the reputation of a heretic in Hungary's very conserva tive Jewish community. More than an alliance between Judaism and Islam, we see in Goldziher's Islam a template for presenting Judaism to the European Christian audience. Like Islam's Hadith, Judaism has Aggadah; like fiqh, Judaism has halakha. 23. Quoted in Heschel, Abraham Geiger, 196. 24. For these and other such comments, see Robert Simon.

After joining Friday prayers at a mosque in Damascus, Goldziher wrote, "I became inwardly convinced that I myself was a Muslim." At a Cairo mosque, "in the midst of the thousands of the pious," he continued, "I rubbed my forehead against the floor of the mosque. Never in my life was I more devout, more truly devout, than on that exalted Friday." "I only wish I could elevate my Judaism to the same rational level as Islam."26 Such com ments are not heard from Jewish scholars who visit a church. With Judaism's alliance with Islam, Christianity is theologically marginalized, resting on dogma contrary to reason, miracles, and the supernatural. Islam in Modern Jewish Self-Understanding In the Jewish polemics against Christianity, which arose, as Uriel Tal has argued, as a result of unclear distinctions between liberal Judaism and liberal Protestantism,27 Islam functioned as a silent interlocutor. As religions of rea son, Islam joined to Judaism—by Jewish thinkers—in pointing to the anomaly of Christianity as a religion in violation of reason. Hermann Cohen, breaking sharply with Renan and the tradition he inspired, viewed Christianity as a reli gion of myth and therefore philosophically erroneous and incapable of moral ity, yet he wrote: "The Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages does not grow so much out of Islam as out of the original monotheism. The more intimate rela tionship between Judaism and Islam—more intimate than with other monothe istic religions—can be explained by the kinship that exists between the mother and daughter religion."28 Lewis echoes him: "Judaism and Islam are sister reli gions, with many important resemblances between them. A Jew, particularly a learned Jew, had a head start over his Christian colleagues in the study of Islam, and an immediacy of understanding which they could not easily attain."29 Franz Rosenzweig's shift to a negative evaluation of Islam reflects his much more sympathetic view of Christianity but also a shift in his concerns from Judaism as a religion of reason to a Heilsgeschichte (salvation history) in 26.

In doing so, Strauss accepted the dichotomy long established in the Christian imagination between the alleged legalism and carnality of Judaism, on the one hand, and the supposedly higher morality and spirituality of Christianity, on the other, but Strauss transvalued that dichotomy: "There is no reconciliation between Judaism and Christianity; Judaism is the anti-Christian principle pure and simple."31 Precisely thanks to its materialism and commitment to the priority of law, Judaism—like Islam is in fact superior to Christianity. According to Strauss, Islamic, Jewish, and ancient Greek philosophies all respect the primacy of law for society and morality, while Christianity and the modern state worry about belief and share a lack of concern for the centrality of law in religion and society. In their disre gard for law Strauss links Christianity and secularism, making Christianity responsible for its own demise in the secular age, whereas Judaism, he claims, remains unaffected by modernity and the secular. Subsequent Jewish Scholarship on Islam Goldziher's originality and productivity make him a singular figure in Islamic studies. Like so many of his Jewish colleagues, Goldziher's major scholarship was completed outside a university institution. Although offered professor ships in Germany, Britain, and Palestine, he refused to leave Hungary yet had to wait until he was fifty-five years old before receiving a professorship at the University of Budapest. Similarly, Gustav Weil was fifty-three when he was appointed professor in 1861; Derenbourg was sixty-five, Munk sixty, Gotthold Weil forty-nine (and lost the professorship two years later when the Nazis came to power). Geiger, Heinrich Graetz, Hartwig Hirschfeld, Martin Sch reiner, Israel Shapiro, Heinrich Speyer, Moritz Steinschneider, and Leopold Zunz were among the many other Jewish scholars who taught either at rabbinic seminars or not at all. Thus their scholarship was not the product of the Ger man university, though their publications stimulated scholarship by Christian 30.

Perhaps the most prominent exam ple is Noeldeke's study of the chronology of the Qur'an, Geschichte des Qorans, published in 1860 and based on Gustav Weil's pioneering study of that topic, Historisch-kritische Einleitung in den Koran, published in 1844. For his work Noeldeke received a professorship at the University of Kiel in 1864, at the age of thirty-one, whereas Weil, though his work was highly acclaimed, did not receive a professorship in Heidelberg until his fifties.

Lud mila Hanisch finds that Oriental studies, especially scholarship on Islam, was dominated by Jews by the 1920s, and she estimates that in 1933 about 25 per cent of the chairs in Orientalistik were occupied by Jews, with many more Jews (and a few women!) lower on the totem pole.32 The result, however, was that Islamic studies was decimated once the Nazis came to power and Jews lost their academic positions. Semitic philology at the University of Berlin, for example, was supposed to be changed to Aryan philology.33 Many—but not all—of the Jewish scholars who went into exile reestablished their scholarly work at universities in Israel, the United States, and elsewhere, but the nature and tone of their scholarship inevitably shifted in the post-World War II era, as it did in Germany. During the Third Reich, Jewish scholarship was neither cited nor recognized, and after the war the work of Jewish scholars, especially in Qur'an studies, did not continue in Germany until recent decades, primarily under the efforts of Angelika Neuwirth.34 By the turn of the century, the study of Arabic had become common place in the rabbinic schools of Europe, and studies by Jews of Arabic Jewish 32.

Perhaps for the first time, the Qur'anic texts are reintegrated into their original cultural context and seen for what they were before they were canonized into the foundational document of a new religion—namely, answers to pressing contemporary questions and problems, answers that engaged, modified, adapted, and re-interpreted narratives and motives with which their audience must already to some degree have been familiar. For Geiger, Horovitz, and Speyer, the Qur'an presented itself not merely as the starting point of Islamic history but rather as a transitional text that needed to be relocated within a complex, religiously and linguistically pluralistic milieu of origin" (The Quran in Con text: Historical and Literary Investigations into the Quranic Milieu, ed.

A change of tone is apparent, however, in some of those studies. Islam was not necessarily elevated, as it had been in earlier studies. Hirschfeld, for example, writes that the Qur'an is "monotonous to read, in spite of its bombastic rheto ric," and its "manifold difficulties repel rather than encourage the study of the Qur'an."35 Mittwoch's study of prayer in Islam insists on its derivation from Judaism, even in its ruling of five prayers per day, in contrast to Judaism's three.36 The rejection of Islam's originality bases itself on an insistence on Judaism's autochthony: it is the religion that gave rise to other monothe isms but is of its own creation. Parallels between the Bible and the writings of ancient Near Eastern religions were rejected by Jewish scholars and theolo gians as misunderstandings of the underlying intention of the biblical texts, which allegedly sought to undermine paganism even as they endorsed similar rituals and teachings. Judaism's religious autochthony was, of course, a substitute for divine revelation: if God did not author the Bible, then at least its importance could be said to derive from its influence in creating two additional monotheis tic religions. The diminishing enthusiasm for Islam among early twentieth century Jewish scholars, then, had to be tempered by the desire to view it as Judaism's contribution to world civilization. At the same time, a distinction was necessary between Islam as a religion and Muslims who sought military conquest. The Ottoman expansion and the concerns to Europe posed by the Young Turks militated against continued Jewish enthusiasm for Islam. Zionism was a further stimulus for a change of direction. Gil Eyal has demonstrated the transfer of knowledge from European Jewish scholars of Islam to public policy within the Yishuv and the state of Israel.37 Zionist Ori entalisms, expressed in literature, art, and music as well as in politics, moved in a variety of directions.38 Some of the leading Jewish scholars of Islam in Europe endorsed a bilingual Hebrew university of Hebrew and Arabic, and even a binational state, and Horovitz, director of the Hebrew University's School of Oriental Studies, wanted the school to hire a sheikh to teach various 35.

The notion of Arabs as timeless and stagnant was, of course, central to much of the European Orientalist discourse described by Said. For some Zionists, it led to wearing a keffiyah and riding a camel as the apotheosis of Jewish identity, gestures held in contempt by other Zionists, such as Joseph Klausner, who wrote that "if a Jew happens to adopt Bedouin customs; if he manages to ride a horse and shoot a gun and wear an Arab robe—right away our Hebrew writers get excited. ... If [the establishment of a Jewish Yishuv in Erets Israel means]... assimilation into Arab backwardness, it is better to stay in the Diaspora and assimilate into the enlightened Western culture."40 The Jewish identification with Islam became complex and fraught with the Zionist movement. As Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin writes, "The Zionist return was to . . . the spiritual ideal of Protestantism—The Holy Land of the Sec ond Temple period, the age of Jesus Christ.'*411 would go farther and say that for the Zionists, the Holy Land functioned as a kind of Jesus: innocent, pure, uncorrupted, timeless, in exile, waiting for its resurrection with the "second coming" after two thousand years of Zionists, just as liberal Protestants thought that they could recover the two-thousand-year-old historical Jesus. The Zionist alignment with Christendom was prepared by an overheated Zion ist fascination with Jesus, from the poet Uri Zvi Greenberg to Klausner, mak ing Jesus the figure representing collective Jewish suffering. Combined with the conflict with Palestinian Arabs, the result was a Jewish turn away from Islam in favor of an alliance with the Christian imaginary. Conclusion The contrast between Jewish and Christian evaluations of Islam is striking. For many of Germany's leading Christian scholars, Islam was another example of Judaism—a religion of law and cultic ritual. Indeed, as Suzanne Akbari has 39.

For so many German Jewish thinkers and historians of the nineteenth century, Islam was not only an object of admiration but also a template for presenting Judaism to the European world. Through their studies of the ratio nality of Islamic law and ethics, their admiration for Islamic monotheism and rejection of anthropomorphism, and their explanations for the rise of Islam and the emergence of the Qur'an within the milieu of rabbinic Judaism, Jews were defending the rational and ethical basis of Judaism's legal system and the importance of its commitment to monotheism and religious law. By arguing for the overwhelming influence of rabbinic Judaism on Islam's ideas and reli gious practices, these Jewish scholars were also providing a substitute for tra ditional belief in divine revelation: perhaps God had not revealed the Jewish scriptures, but they were powerful enough to have created the three monothe istic religions of the West. Yet the significance of Jewish scholarship on Islam extends farther. By identifying the Jewish echoes in the Qur'an and the Hadith, Jewish scholars established one of the major religious currents that shaped early Islam. Their Christian counterparts in Islamic studies during the nineteenth century, such as Noeldeke and Wellhausen, focused instead on the influences of Hellenis tic and Christian heretical movements. Had it not been for the contributions of Jewish scholarship, the contemporary understandings of the Qur'an, par ticularly in Neuwirth's work, as reflecting a polyphony of religious voices in antiquity, would have been greatly diminished, if not rendered impossible.43 The study of Islam was part of the larger, nineteenth-century German Jewish agenda of purifying Judaism, not simply liberalizing it—purging it of pietism and messianism, exoticism and eroticism, internationalism. The effort to "rationalize" Judaism has been described in the histories of nineteenth century Jewish thought and social history. Yet Islam's role has never been included. By that, I mean several things: the contributions of Jewish scholars in creating Islamic studies; the importance of Arabic in the education of European rabbis; the imagined Islam and its role in encouraging changes in 42.

Jewish attitudes shifted, of course, with Zionism's rise, and with the twentieth century's new possibilities of Jewish alliances with Christianity. World War II and the establishment of the state of Israel created entirely new conditions, political and theological, in Jewish self understanding and relations with Islam as well as Christianity. The difference of nineteenth-century European Jewish Orientalism is this: identifying Judaism with Islam was part of the effort at Jewish de Orientalization; that is, reorienting Judaism to a golden age Islam of science, philosophy, and attentiveness to Greek philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and language arts. To perform that function, of course, Islam, too, required purging—of Sufism, Shiism, and other elements too similar to the mysticism and apocalypticism they abjured in Judaism. Islam's function in nineteenth century German Jewish discourse was not part of an agenda of Orientalism; on the contrary, identifying Judaism with Islam was the tool to de-Orientalize Judaism.</page></plain_text>
