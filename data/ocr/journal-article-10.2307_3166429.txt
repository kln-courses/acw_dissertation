"Father Zahm on the Six Days of Creation." "Father Zahm on Inspiration." "Father Zahm Honored with a Private Audience by Iis Holiness."' During the final decade of the nineteenth century religious periodicals and secular newspapers alike chronicled the growing fascination of the American Catho- lic community with the public debate over the latest theories regarding the evolution of species. One figure in particular, John Augustine Zahm, a Holy Cross priest and professor of chemistry and physics in the University of Notre Dame, captured many of the headlines and captivated Catholic audiences with his sophisticated, clear expositions of the various theories in the post-Darwinian controversies and with his repeated assurances that the idea of evolution, properly understood, posed no obstacle to the faith of the individual Catholic. In this regard Zahm played an unprecedented role in the religious history of the United States, for he combined in his person the seemingly diverse perspectives of the American citizen, the Catholic priest, and the evolutionist. Among the few American priest-scientists at the turn of the century, Zahm was the most competent, articulate, accomplished-and publicly prominent. Thus he was uniquely situated to contribute significantly to the process by which the American Catholic community came to know the modern world, for it was in the ongoing and bitter debate over evolution, and Darwin's theory thereof, that many American Catholics first encountered a scientific worldview buttressed by historical consciousness and developmentalist thought.2 Zahm was the first well-known American Catholic scholar to read, respond to, and provide for his own community of faith scientific and 1.

He affirmed in no uncertain terms the ultimate compatibility of an evolutionary worldview and the central tenets of Catholic teaching on human nature, creation, and divine provi- dence. This public prominence also brought Zahm to the attention of the Roman Catholic curia. Curial officials moved to silence him when, like American Protestant and European Catholic scientists before him, he suggested revi- sions in the interpretation of certain doctrines affected by an acceptance of the general theory of evolution. In many ways "the Zahm affair" epitomized the Roman Catholic crisis over evolution. It reinforced in the minds of conserva- tive churchmen their abiding suspicion that the application of critical methods of scientific inquiry to matters of revealed truth would lead Catholics into a web of heresies. Zahm's ecclesiastical opponents in the Vatican and in America linked his advocacy of evolution and modern science to the uncritical acceptance of American values which they believed were promoted by certain "liberal" members of the clergy and hierarchy. Thus, in addition to the charge of "Americanism," Zahm's detractors perceived in his methodology the outlines of a new heresy, characterized by a reinterpretation of patristic and scholastic terms and categories, a decided preference for inductive reasoning, and a hope of attaining a synthesis of modern science and the ancient faith.. The defining of this heresy, namely, modernism, would engage them well into the next decade. 1. Born in Ohio to immigrant parents in 1851, Zahm entered the seminary at Notre Dame at the age of fifteen. Gifted with a natural aptitude for science, he rose rapidly in the ranks of the Congregation of Holy Cross. By the age of twenty-three he was professor of chemistry and physics, co-director of the science department, director of the library, curator of the museum, and a member of the Board of Trustees of the fledgling university. From 1875 to 1883 Zahm concentrated on building the science department at Notre Dame into a first-rate facility. During sojourns to Europe for research and to procure equipment for Notre Dame's laboratories, he absorbed the details of 3. Zahm was preceded by Paulist George M. Searle and Rev. John Gmeiner, among others, in supporting evolution. But neither of these priests received the acclaim awarded Zahm.

His appreciation of the nuances and complexities of the various positions held by leading American and European naturalists deepened as he entered into correspondence with many of them and studied their work carefully.5 By 1893 Zahm felt he was on the verge of an important contribution to American Catholic intellectual life. To the founder of Notre Dame he wrote: "I am beginning to feel that I have a great mission before me in making known to the Protestant world the true relation of Catholic dogma towards modern science."6 Indeed, from 1893 to 1896 Zahm worked at a feverish pace to educate the public on the methods, hypotheses, and discoveries of modern science. To Catholic and Protestant audiences he characterized Catholic dogma as congenial to the implications of the new findings of biology, paleontology, and anthropology. During these years he published four books, four pamphlets, and twenty-one articles in this cause. He created a sensation at Catholic Summer School lectures in Plattsburgh, New York, and Madison, Wisconsin, became the cause celebre of the International Catholic Scientific Congress at Brussels in 1894, and culminated his performance by accepting an honorary doctorate in philosophy from Pope Leo XIII in 1895.7 Zahm's most significant accomplishment of this period, however, came with the publication of his greatest work, Evolution and Dogma, in February of 1896. The fruit of thirteen years of participation in the public debate, Evolution and Dogma confirmed Zahm's reputation as a leading Catholic apologist and educator. He was not an original theorist, nor did he aspire to be one. He wrote not to advance a new, revised interpretation of evolution which would avoid the miscalculations of Darwin or Lamarck; that ideal theory, he promised, would come in time. Rather, his purpose was to demonstrate the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the various schools of thought and to contend that the limitations of each ought not to discredit the concept of evolution itself. This general concept or theory of 4. Peter J. Bowler, Evolution: The History of an Idea (Los Angeles, 1984), p. 219. 5. See John A.

Before Darwin, British philosophers of science had subscribed to a type of Baconian inductivism in which they held that the systematic collection and classification of data, done without preconceptions on the part of the classifier, would lead to inductive generalizations, a series of propositions, and ultimately "those laws and determinations of absolute actuality" which can be known to be certainly true.9 Darwin qualfied this quest for ultimate certainty in scientific inferences by formulating hypotheses which governed the choice of facts and accounted for those chosen for every investigation. He set forth natural selection, for example, not as a theory for which absolute proof had been obtained, but merely as the most probable explanation for the largest number of facts pertaining to the origin of species. "The line of argument pursued throughout my theory," he explained, "is to establish a point as a probability by induction, and to apply it as a hypothesis to other points, and see whether it will solve them."'1 In Evolution and Dogma Zahm adopted this form of hypothetico-deductive reasoning as a via media between an "inconceivable" empiricism that guaranteed final certitude and a dogmatism, an "ultra-conservatism" based exclusively on deduction from a priori principles, that leads to "a fanatical obstinacy in the assertion of traditional views which are demonstrably untenable."" Zahm allowed himself only one a priori principle: science would not, could not, overturn truths revealed by God in scripture and tradition, for God is one and truth is one. In rejecting dualism, Catholicism allowed the scientists to proceed in their own realm of investigation, accepting the explanation of the origin of species most credible on scientific grounds, confident that the procedure would lead inexorably to a profound affirmation of theism.12 This approach did not hide fallible human science from the light of revelation, Zahm insisted, but it did restrain metaphysics from imposing prematurely upon the course of rational inquiry. Ultimately compatible in their respective conclusions, natural science and metaphysics are nonetheless different disciplines, each with its own integrity: The Copernican theory was denounced as anti-Scriptural ..

That the theory of evolution should be obliged to pass through the same ordeal is not surprising to those familiar with the history of science; but there are yet those among us who derive such little profit from the lessons of the past, and who still persist in their futile attempt to solve by metaphysics problems which, by their very nature, can be worked out only by methods of induction. Naturalists and philosophers are continually intruding on each other's territo- ry. The naturalist philosophizes and the philosopher . . . naturalizes. For naturalists are very much given to making excursions into the domain of metaphysics and to substitute speculations for rigid inductions from observed facts. And metaphysicians sin in a similar manner by attempting to explain, by methods of their own, the various phenomena of the material world, and in seeking by simple a priori reasons to evolve from their inner consciousness a logical system of the physical universe. The result is inextricable confusion and errors without number. It is neither science nor philosophy, but a mixtum compositum, which not only gives false views of nature but still falser views of the Author of nature.13 Opponents of evolution tended to ignore the axiom that science "discloses the method of the world, not its cause; religion, its cause and not its method."14 In a misbegotten attempt to safeguard divine providence, Zahm charged, they accepted special creation of immutable species despite over- whelming evidence of transmutation. To preserve belief in human creation in the image of God, they excluded a priori the possibility of human descent from lower forms of animal life. In Zahm's estimation, this attempt produced inferior theology as well as inferior science. Modern science had weakened irrevocably the foundation of the creationist's worldview. Against the spontaneous generation of life, for example, Redi and Pasteur had demonstrated that in every instance life originates from antecedent life. Geologists described in convincing detail the fluctuations of the earth and "the multifold extinct forms entombed in its crust." Thus one must reckon the age of the earth not at six thousand years but "by millions if not tens of millions of years." Again, paleontologists confirmed that " a hundred million species or more have appeared and died out." Zahm concluded from empirical demonstrations of this sort that "everything seems to point conclusively to a development from the simple to the complex, and to disclose, in Spencer's words, 'change from the homoge- neous to the heterogeneous through continuous differentiations and integra- tions.' " The changes and developments are the result "not of so many separate creative acts, but rather of a single creation and of a subsequent uniform process of Evolution, according to certain definite and immutable laws."15 Consequently, Zahm argued, the older views regarding creation must be 13.

Ibid., pp. 50-53. 478</page><page sequence="6">JOHN ZAHM materially modified to harmonize with modern science: "Between the two theories, that of creation and that of Evolution the lines are drawn tautly, and one or the other theory must be accepted.... No compromise, no via media, is possible. We must needs be either creationists or evolutionists. We cannot be both.'6 For Zahm, the choice between the two was a question "of natural science, not of metaphysics, and hence one of evidence which is more or less tangible." In delineating the grounds for "the almost universal acceptance of the theory by contemporary scientists," Zahm followed a procedure which he believed to be at the heart of Catholic wisdom: seek truth wherever it may be found, separate it from error, and reconcile it with other truths.'7 In evaluating the thought of the leading naturalists of the modern era, he found "elements of truth" in Darwin, Lamarck, Cuvier, Romanes, Mivart, and others. Neither "a Darwinist or a Huxleyist," he was equally comfortable quoting Agassiz against certain implications of natural selection and Darwin against the theory of abiogenesis held by the creationists. His one allegiance was to the general theory of evolution which, he was convinced, eventually would absorb and incorporate salient aspects of each modification of merit.18 Zahm thus refrained from endorsing in toto any particular system, lest its imperfections detract from the general theory. If, for example, Darwin's first description of natural selection was challenged in its assumption of the existence and development of infinitesimal forms of life from lower to higher by a lack of evidence of these forms in the fossil record, it would "not strictly follow that such difficulties can validly be urged against the general theory of organic Evolution, as distinguished from Evolution through natural selec- tion."19 Zahm recalled that Darwin himself had modified his theory as new data demanded. In the second edition of The Origin of Species, for example, he revised a previous estimate that all animal and plant life derived from four or five progenitors, acknowledging that "all organic beings which have ever lived on the earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator." Zahm found this adjustment to be in keeping with scientific fact and thus in closer conformity to revealed truth.20 At the same time, Zahm lashed out at neo-Darwinists for regarding natural selection as the sole and sufficient cause for all organic development even as Darwin was reducing its role by allowing for environmental factors.21 Although each theory contained an element of truth, there was as yet no theory competent "to coordinate all the facts that Evolution is supposed to 16.

Ibid., p. 370. 479</page><page sequence="7">CHURCH HISTORY embrace." Nonetheless, Zahm predicted, the development of a "true, compre- hensive, irrefragable" theory demonstrating the "ordained becoming of new species by the operation of secondary causes" is inevitable. This ideal theory would admit "of a preconceived progress 'towards a foreseen goal' and disclose the unmistakable evidence and the certain impress of a Divine Intelligence and purpose." Zahm hastened to add that "the lack of this perfected theory, however, does not imply that we have not already an adequate basis for a rational assent to the theory of Organic Evolution. By no means. The arguments adduced in behalf of Evolution . . . are of sufficient weight to give the theory a degree of probability which permits of little doubt as to its truth. Whatever, then, may be said of Lamarckism, Darwinism, and other theories of Evolution, the fact of Evolution, as the evidence now stands, is scarcely any longer a matter for controversy."22 In spite of Zahm's professed zeal for the independence of scientific inquiry from metaphysical deduction, dogmatic considerations did play a role in his assessments of various theories. This point is quite clear in Zahm's treatment of the origin and development of the human race, a topic especially delicate for a Catholic apologist. Forced in a sense to declare himself on this issue, Zahm sided with the Neo-Lamarckians, or, in the terminology of James R. Moore, the proponents of "Christian Darwinisticism." He joined them in advancing modifications of Darwin's theory in order to circumnavigate certain philosophical implications of the stark struggle for survival depicted by natural selection in unqualified form. Zahm took this position to avoid the spectre of agnosticism he saw lurking in the Neo-Darwinism of the day.23 Lamarck had posited a theory of transmutation which in its most general form embraced two causal factors: an innate power conferred on nature by God that tends to produce a series of plants and animals of increasing complexity and perfection; and an inner, adapting disposition peculiar to living bodies which assures the performance of actions sufficient to the needs created by a changing environment, those actions becoming instinctive and heritable.24 Zahm joined a distinguished company who advocated theistic evolution by integrating these Lamarckian "powers" into a Christian understanding of the ordered progression of species under God. Their softening of Darwinian theory allowed these theists-Asa Gray, Richard Owen, Robert Chambers, St. George Jackson Mivart, among others-to reduce the level of intellectual tension or "cognitive dissonance" between rival "epistemes" or ways of knowing the world presented by modern science on the one hand, and traditional theism on the other.25 The addition of the 22.

Zahm drew on this tradition when he endorsed the theory of human evolution explicated in Mivart's 1871 work, On the Genesis of Species, which subordinated natural selection to the role played by "special powers and tendencies existing in each organism." According to this English Catholic, these special powers were the divine instrument employed in directing organisms to produce those forms which God had preconceived. The human body was derived by this evolutionary process, while the soul, source of humanity's ethical and rational nature, appeared in each case by divine fiat.26 Zahm came to be known as "the American Mivart" for his endorsement of this theory.27 In adopting this position Zahm made a first attempt at "a perfect synthesis between the inductions of science on the one hand and the deductions of metaphysics on the other."28 In a sense, Zahm compromised with himself: as a naturalist, he surrendered strict adherence to inductive method by positing a supernatural act of God in infusing the rational soul; as priest, he surren- dered the traditional view of the direct creation of the body of Adam. As it turned out, he ended up satisfying neither scientific nor religious purists. In spite of the body-soul dualism which Mivart's system seemed to foster, Zahm accepted the theory as compatible with Christian belief. He sought to vindicate theistic evolution by demonstrating that the great patristic and medieval theologians held it to be true: "Evolution has been condemned as anti-Patristic and anti-Scholastic, although Saints Gregory of Nyssa, Augus- tine, and Thomas Aquinas are most explicit in their assertion of principles that are in perfect accord with all the legitimate demands of theistic Evolution. . . . The Bishop of Hippo, in his 'De Genesi ad Litteram' proleptically announced all the fundamental principles of modern Evolution. He recognized Evolution not only in individuals, but ... in the sum of all things. God did not create the world, as it now exists, actually, actualiter, but potentially and causally, potentialiter et causaliter."29 To lend additional support to Mivart, Zahm mounted a lengthy exegesis of texts of Aquinas which seemed to affirm that the rational soul is specially created and infused into the human body by God.30 26. See John D. Root, "The Final Apostasy of St. George Jackson Mivart," Catholic Historical Review 71 (1985): 1-25, for a statement of Mivart's development, and especially for his reaction to Leo XIII's encyclical on biblical interpretation which, Root argues, "provided a sharp impetus" to Mivart's final break from the church (pp. 7-8). 27. Zahm was in correspondence with Mivart, who thanked him for "carrying on my work in the United States"; Mivart to Zahm, 18 May 1896, HCA. 28. Zahm, Evolution and Dogma, p. 70. 29. Ibid., p. 416. 30. Ibid., pp. 71, 354. 481</page><page sequence="9">CHURCH HISTORY Moreover, Zahm argued that acceptance of evolution would enhance rather than imperil authentic Catholic teaching on divine providence and human nature: And from the theistic point of view [evolution] exhibits the Deity creating matter and force, and putting them under the dominion of law. It tells of a God who inaugurates the era of terrestrial life by the creation of one or more simple organisms ... and causing them, under the action of His Providence, to evolve in the course of time into all the myriad, complicated, specialized, and perfect forms which now people the earth. Surely this is a nobler conception than that which represents him as experimenting, as it were, with crude materials and succeeding, only after numerous attempts, in producing the organism which He is supposed to have had in view from the beginning. To picture the Deity thus working tentatively, is an anthropomorphic view of the Creator, which is as little warranted by Catholic dogma as it is by genuine science.31 Furthermore, Zahm claimed, there is nothing in evolution contrary to scripture. "God did potentially what the ordinary Scripture interpreter believes he did by a distinct, immediate exercise of infinite power," he argued, citing Augustine's exegesis of Genesis. There the great theologian held that animals and plants were brought into existence by natural causes: "He tells us explicitly that they were created potentially, and that they were afterwards developed into the manifold forms we now behold."32 Certain scientific discoveries called into question traditional interpreta- tions of the Bible on a number of points: the age of the world; the universality of the flood; and the creation of Adam and Eve. On these questions, Zahm invoked Pope Leo XIII. It was not the purpose of sacred scripture to teach science, the pope had written. Accordingly, Zahm accepted Newman's obiter dicta theory in claiming that certain biblical passages admit of no uniform interpretation: "It seems unworthy of the divine greatness that the Almighty should, in the revelation of Himself to us, undertake mere secular duties and assume the office of a narrator, as such, or an historian, or geographer, except in so far as the secular matters bear directly upon the revealed truth."33 Obviously, Zahm claimed a freedom of interpretation in matters not defined dogmatically by the church, including the question of human origins. He announced boldly that the church is not committed to a theory about the origin of the world or its inhabitants: "Hence as a Catholic I am bound to no theory of Evolution or special creation, except in so far as there may be positive evidence on behalf of such theory."34 And as one who seemed at times to thrive on controversy, Zahm could not resist taking a swipe at his ecclesiastical opponents in Rome and America. He was unambiguous, and undiplomatic, in pointing the finger at the integralists who, in support of 31. Ibid., p. 122. 32. Ibid., p. 71. 33.

Zahm, Evolution and Dogma, p. xiv. 482</page><page sequence="10">JOHN ZAHM creationism and the process of deduction from metaphysical principles, refused to acknowledge the high degree of probability resting with evolution- ary theory. Instead, Zahm charged, "they love to descant on the dictum of the Scholastics, a possibili ad actum non valet consecutio-possibility is far from implying existence."35 Evolution and Dogma was not the first occasion upon which Zahm criticized the neo-scholastic obstruction of scientific inquiry. Nor was this Zahm's first call for revisions in the Roman Catholic interpretation of the biblical and traditional witness on creation, providence, and human nature. But it was the first to attract international attention. It was translated into Italian (1896), French (1897), and Spanish (1904) and was promoted with an advertising campaign by publisher D. H. McBride that played up the controversial aspects of the book. It is not surprising, therefore, that Evolution and Dogma soon incited the antagonisms of curial officials whose worldview it seemed to subvert. 2. The time of Zahm's intense and highly publicized activity as an apologist for science coincided with a period of ferment in the confrontation of Roman Catholicism and the modern age. From 1894 to 1899 conservative Roman ecclesial officials mounted a fresh assault in the campaign against modernity which culminated in the papal condemnation of Americanism in 1899. Because the heresies of modernity appeared to infect culture in all of its diverse expressions, traditionalists perceived the presence of the disease everywhere: in the application of the higher criticism to sacred texts; in the separation of church and state; in the attempt to assimilate Catholicism to the local and national communities to which the churches belonged; and, invariably, in the advances of the natural sciences. While in Europe in 1894, Zahm learned that Mivart had come under suspicion for views which he first had expressed twenty-three years earlier. At the same time, the rumor circulated in ecclesiastical circles that the theory of evolution itself was to be condemned by the Vatican.36 Fueled by the debate over Leo XIII's encyclical on biblical criticism, Providentissimus Deus, controversy raged in the ensuing months between liberal and conservative Catholics over the meaning of the book of Genesis and the authorship of the Pentateuch.37 In this context, Zahm's unflinching advocacy of the general theory of evolution placed him at the center of the storm, in large part because he also 35.

Indeed, there is evidence supporting the view that Zahm understood his crusade for evolution to be a significant contribution to the self-conscious effort on the part of many liberals to assimilate Catholics into the mainstream of American political and intellectual life. One cause especially dear to "the movement" was education on every level: at the Catholic University of America, in public and parochial schools, and on the lecture circuits Zahm frequented in the 1890s. In his brilliant apology for freedom of inquiry-an American value cherished by liberal Catholics-in matters scientific, Zahm understood himself to be promoting "the movement" in a most public, and thus persuasive, way. It was this sense for publicity, exaggerated by a fancy for the sensational, which impelled Zahm to orchestrate a series of headline-grabbing events during the years of his Americanist activity. "Keep yourself before the public always," he advised his brother Albert, if you wish the public to remember you or do anything for you."38 To ensure that the public would remember him, Zahm made an unusual request of his friend and fellow Americanist Denis O'Connell, rector of North American College in Rome, in February 1893: I need another favor-"strictly confidential"-until the favor is granted. For 21 years I have been trying to build the science department at ND.... We now have the best equipped, most complete "Catholic scientific establishment in the world." Catholics have long needed this. . . . [But] buildings are not enough. I have lectured and written articles on subjects connected with science and religion. In a word, I have endeavored to show the world that the Church is now, as she ever has been, the patron of science, and that no conflict between religion and science is possible .... The favor I ask is not entirely personal. It could reflect on Notre Dame and on Catholic science in America as well, and will call attention to the fact that Rome-&amp; especially the Pope-is the first to foster science and encourage those who devote themselves to its cultivation. The favor I ask is the honorary degree of Doctor of Science-Scientiae Doctor-given by the proper authorities in Rome &amp; if possible, signed by the Holy Father himself.... I will be glad to meet any little expenses incident to securing the degree. For a very special reason, I would be pleased if it could be obtained at once.39 The "very special reason" for the request no doubt had to do with the upcoming lectures at Plattsburgh-the lectures which, as it turned out, touched off Zahm's rise to fame. A dramatic display of papal approval would help to silence critics of theistic evolution. When the doctorate was awarded, two years after the request and in philosophy rather than science, Zahm was delighted. He interpreted the event as a signal that his party was in 38.

That year witnessed both the publication of Bible, Science and Faith and, coinciden- tally, a swing of mood in Rome, where conservatives seemed to awaken to the threat evolutionism posed to the neo-scholastic worldview. After a trium- phant year which included a celebrated address before the Scientific Congress in 1894, a private audience with the pope, and the awarding of the honorary doctorate in February of 1895, Zahm delivered the inaugural lectures at the Catholic Columbian Summer School in Madison, Wisconsin, in July of 1895. He took that opportunity to introduce the major themes of the forthcoming Evolution and Dogma: the "simian origin of man"; the infusion of the rational soul; and the heritage of theistic evolution in the Fathers and Aquinas. From that moment forward, he was embroiled in controversy. In an open letter to Milwaukee's Catholic Citizen, Rev. J. W. Vahey called Zahm an "agnostic scientist." John Gmeiner, a priest and evolutionist, replied that he shared Zahm's views completely and referred readers to an earlier book of his own.41 Meanwhile, Zahm sent a rough draft of Evolution and Dogma to Paulist priest Augustine Hewit, who advised against publica- tion. The business about the evolution of Adam's body, he worried, would arouse opposition.42 As if to confirm Zahm's growing notoriety, the New York Herald published a five-page article under the headline, "Is Dr. Zahm a Heretic?" The story was written with Zahm's assistance!43 All this publicity was too much for the Summer School Board to bear. After Zahm's second appearance at Plattsburgh in August of 1895, Father Thomas J. Conaty, president of the board, disavowed responsibility for Zahm's opinions. The episcopal supervisor of the program, Sebastian Messmer of Green Bay, initiated a campaign to remove liberals from the lecture circuit. Infuriated that Zahm had invited Catholic University professors Thomas O'Gorman and Edward Pace to lecture on the circuit, Messmer tried to "disinvite" them. He explained to O'Gorman that the board had ruled to exclude Catholic University professors from the program, because "having been exposed to a great deal of incrimination last year on account of Dr. Zahm's expression on the evolution of man, we have to be much more careful this year."44 One Jesuit anti-evolutionist, James F. X. Hoeffer, resigned from the board, charging that Zahm had misrepresented to his audiences the 40.

He refused to withdraw his invitation, and the two spoke as scheduled. To his detractors on the board Zahm quoted Bishop John Lancaster Spalding's declaration that Aquinas's point of view in all that concerns natural science is outdated. Modern attempts to shore up the concord are made in vain. Instead, Zahm stated, Catholics should emulate Thomas by devising innovative responses to the new discoveries of science. Were they living today, he suggested, Aquinas and Augustine would not be defending past solutions, but would be "the boldest and most comprehensive and the most liberal minds the world has ever known."46 Undaunted, Zahm published Evolution and Dogma in February of 1896 and lectured on it at the Catholic Winter School in New Orleans. However, upon his return from New Orleans he learned to his dismay that he had been transferred to Rome by Gilbert Francais, Superior-General of Holy Cross, to take the post of Procurator-General for the congregation. Critics in the Catholic press speculated that the transfer was designed to deter Zahm from further publication. "The evolution bacillus is a dangerous thing," chirped Arthur Preuss, editor of the conservative Review. He suggested that the pure air of Catholic orthodoxy would help Zahm recuperate.47 "I have never been 'disciplined,' as they put it, and it is not likely that I shall be," Zahm replied bravely. "My views may be not looked upon with favor by all in Rome," he admitted, "but I know that every eminent man of science throughout Europe is in perfect sympathy with my opinions." Nonetheless, he rushed into print a slender volume, Scientific Theory and Catholic Doctrine, in which he repudiated Darwin and Huxley unequivocal- ly.48 As Zahm arrived in Rome on 1 April 1896, the controversy over Americanism was entering a crucial phase. On 19 April Americanist bishop John Ireland spoke at O'Gorman's consecration on the respective roles of diocesan and religious order priests; his comments offended Jesuits and Redemptorists, whom he blamed for Catholic setbacks in England during penal times. Within months Americanist John Keane was forced to resign from the office of rector at Catholic University of America. By year's end the 45. Messmer to Zahm, 20 January 1896, HCA. 46.

He scored quick victories for his congregation by securing papal commendation for the college in Washington, D.C., and confirmation of the Rules and Constitution of the Holy Cross Sisters. O'Connell welcomed Zahm to "the Club," a group of churchmen in sympathy with the Americanist movement which included Cardinals Serafino and Vincenzo Vanutelli. Zahm became another agent in Rome for the liberal cause.50 This activity did not go unnoticed by the Roman opponents of American- ism, the leader of whom was Salvatore Brandi, S.J., editor of the influential journal La Civilta Cattolica. In July 1896 he wrote to his episcopal ally in New York, Michael Corrigan, that Zahm's "recent utterances on transfor- mism, his relations with the liberal party, well known in the Vatican and Propaganda, will interfere with his work as Procurator of Holy Cross."51 The Italian translation of Evolution and Dogma, which appeared that fall, exacerbated Zahm's problems. He reported to his brother in December that "the Jesuits are already training their biggest guns on me.... The die is cast."52 In January 1897 the first in a series of negative reviews of Evolution and Dogma appeared in Civilta Cattolica. Although Zahm was still confident enough to assure Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore that "the future is ours- Leo and Rampolla still with us," he delivered his last formal paper on evolution five months later at the fourth International Catholic Scientific Congress.53 In December Zahm returned reluctantly to Notre Dame to serve as Provincial of the Congregation in America. Three months later, Ireland visited him to discuss the situation in Rome. Ireland was struck by Zahm's dedication to the cause and wrote O'Connell: "You have surely fixed him in the movement. He is 'the movement' and will drive the Holy Cross, Ave Maria, and C. onward with great force."54 Obviously the archbishop of Saint Paul felt that from his position of leadership at Notre Dame, Zahm would serve ably the Americanist cause. The news from Rome that year proved Ireland's optimism unfounded, however. In July O'Connell informed Zahm that Charles Magnien's book attacking Americanism had received the imprimatur and that the pope was considering the question.

The prohibition . . . extends to all translations made in any language."55 For the next eight months Francais, Zahm, O'Connell, and Ireland worked assiduously to prevent publication of the decree. Zahm's mood fluctuated from bitter disappointment to outrage. He wrote Francais immedi- ately, promising full submission to the decree. Yet he maneuvered to avoid any public retraction of his position and expressed frustration about the shadow cast on Holy Cross by the affair. He wrote to Ireland: The Index decree must be permanently suppressed &amp; the present incumbent [Zahm] must be confirmed in the provincialship.... We shall win in the long war, for truth and justice are on our side; the intelligence of the world and the increasing might of America are with us . . . it is a fight for progress, for true Americanism, for the Catholic University, a fight against Jesuitical tyranny, against obscurantism and medievalism.... It would, no doubt, be a great victory for the enemy to get me out of my present position, but it would cripple Notre Dame, ruin Holy Cross &amp; give a terrible setback to our community.56 The decree remained unpublished, although the New York Daily Tribune ran a letter from Zahm asking his Italian translator to withdraw the book from distribution, on the orders of the Holy See.57 Who delated Zahm? The answer is unclear, but the list of candidates includes Brandi, Satolli, and the American Jesuits on the Summer School Board. Francais did some investigative work in Zahm's behalf and enumer- ated the reasons for the judgment against him: curial officials were displeased that Zahm had portrayed Augustine and Aquinas as evolutionists; they felt that Zahm and Mivart had jeopardized the integrity of scripture by threatening to reduce the story of Adam and Eve to a myth; they resented Zahm's penchant for ecclesiastical intrigue, his friendship with the impru- dent O'Connell, and his support of the Americanists.58 It was no coincidence that the decree banning Evolution and Dogma was followed four months later by the encyclical condemning Americanism. By the turn of the century, neo-scholastic philosophers and theologians in power at Rome began to perceive Americanism and evolutionism as aspects of a larger historical movement which challenged their positions of privilege in 55.

Thus he was the object of the conservatives' resentment of the Americanist advocacy of options in areas which had been settled upon and closed to debate, in official expression if not actual practice: the nature of religious life; the ideal of Catholic education; the unity of church and state; the preference for supernatural over natural virtues.60 Zahm represented a threat of a different kind as well. As an evolutionist he adopted a methodology which seemed to reflect a new and dangerous way of thinking about church and world-a new "episteme." It was this methodol- ogy that troubled Brandi most about Evolution and Dogma. Zahm took as a starting point not deductions from revealed truth, but "unbiased" inductions from empirical data. He promised a "synthesis" of these inductions and the "authentic" teaching of the Catholic tradition. He interpreted scripture critically, assigning different levels of authority to different passages and scientific competence to very few. And he claimed that the defined teachings of the church on these matters were few in number, which allowed him to proceed liberally in most questions.61 Most egregious to Brandi was Zahm's grounding of his positions in Pope Leo's teaching on scripture on the one hand and in the authority of the Fathers and medieval scholastics on the other. At stake in this battle was the interpretation of these figures, especially Thomas, upon whose authority the worldview of the neo-scholastic was based. Brandi wrote: Speaking of St. Thomas Aquinas, Zahm acknowledges that the Angelic Doctor, in perfect accord with the traditional doctrine of the Fathers, maintains that the body of the first human was formed directly and immediately by God Himself. It would therefore seem that the Angelic Doctor cannot and must not be cited in favor of evolution.... But this is not the case. After quoting Mivart that "God created the soul of man directly and his body indirectly, through the operation of secondary causes," Professor Zahm, with a truly American lack of restraint, writes: "This opinion favoring the derived origin of the human body is in perfect harmony with other principles set forth by the great luminaries of the Church, St. Augustine and St. Thomas." As if this were not enough, in the following pages he adds: "This opinion of the derived origin of the human body can be held in conformity with the teachings of the Angelic Doctor under another aspect." 59. For a thorough discussion of the neo-scholastic worldview and the ways in which it was threatened by reliance on secondary causes in the manner described by Zahm and others, see Gabriel Daly, Transcendence and Immanence: A Study in Catholic Modernism and Integralism (Oxford, 1980). 60.

Most disturbingly, Brandi concluded, Zahm assures us of the victory of the theory of evolution over other explanations of creation and recommends it "not only for Christian philoso- phy but also for Catholic apologetics."63 To propose that Thomas had condoned the theory of bodily evolution was to introduce an undesirable pluralism of interpretation into the reading of scholasticism. Zahm had attempted to do the same with the Fathers and with the Bible. This approach threatened the neo-scholastic monopoly on the interpretation of these sources. Accordingly, Brandi derided Zahm's method of interpretation, with its characteristic American foolhardiness, as much as he did the conclusions to which the method led.64 Of course neither Brandi nor Zahm followed the implications of this inductive, or hypothetico-deductive, method to its unforeseen ends. But in 1899 they jousted on the tip of an iceberg against which neo-scholasticism and the church it claimed to represent would crash in the first decade of the new century. By the time of the condemnation of modernism in 1907, Zahm long since had retired from independent research and apologetics for science and Catholic dogma. Zahm had been one of the first casualties in the war against the proposed syntheses of "the ancient faith and modern thought."65 62. Ibid., pp. 40-41: "Dopo d'aver ripetuto col Mivart, che, 'Dio cre6 l'anima dell'uomo direttamente, e il suo corpo indirettamente, ossia per l'operazione delle cause secondarie,' il Prof. Zahm, con una disinvoltura veramente americana, scrive, 'Quest'opinione della origine derivativa del corpo di Adamo e pur essa in pefetta armonia con altri principii emessi dai due grandi luminari della Chiesa, Sant' Agostino e San Tommaso.'... Evidentemente, quale che siasi questo 'aspetto,' se crediamo al Prof. Zahm, bsiognera dire che l'angelico Dottore fu illogico e incoerente." 63. Ibid., p. 41. It should be noted that the condemnation of Zahm was intricately connected with Bishop Hedley of England, who supported Zahm and wrote similar opinions on evolution. The "Zahm affair" was meant to make an example of the American. 64. Ibid., pp. 42-48. 65.
