<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science and the Humanities: The Case of Turner Michel Serres I. The Case of Turner An Anachronism Exploding with hot colors, the canvases of Turner seem to reproduce sensory impressions. For this reason, even though almost all of them date from the first half of the nineteenth century, they were for a long time taken to have been painted in a "pre-Impressionist" style. They seemed, in effect, to announce the canvases of Monet. What are we to make of such a judgment? Starting from the future to turn back into the past, it commits an anachronism: the reference to future artists retrospectively eclipses the originality of the unfortunate painter's works. What would happen if we applied this same reasoning to ourselves, since we too are ignorant of what will happen to us? What will the next century say that we "announced" today? If the future has not forgotten us, will it know us better than we know ourselves? Conjugated in the future anterior, this retrograde movement constructs a story that makes sense and truth over the long term of history, but it is a story whose relationship to contemporary time is unavailable. To see better what Turner painted in London around 1800, let us then forget Monet, 1900, and Paris. To appreciate the paintings of the solar master just as he made them, let us plunge their burning colors into the milieu in which he lived, and which his work necessarily reflected. The Industrial Revolution was then extending the reign of heat over hearth and home, over the bellows of the forge and the boilers of machines. Extracted by thousands of miners, coal and the makings of steel underwent combustion in blast furnaces con- ceived by engineers and manned by a new working class. Smoking from the first factories, all England of that era was stockpiling capital, materials, energy, and men, and these diverse accumulations transformed cities, the 6 SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="2">The Case of Turner 7 countryside, social groups, even theories and mentalities-in short, they changed the face of the world. A few decades ago, we were still living in the world that was born there, at that moment. Nature and Society Because heat drove the mine machinery, propelled the locomotives, animated the propeller-driven or paddlewheel boats-those very things that gave England the temporary mastery of the seas-because, via the burning of coal, it stoked steel foundries-whence the forge masters drew their financial might-heat destroyed the agrarian, cool society of water mills and windmills. It created a new and burning society. Everywhere, fires unknown before that time were lit in such a way that a thousand things that had been stable for a long time disappeared, while others began to move. Then cities were smothered under blankets of unbreatheable smoke, and London's streets, squares, and rooftops vanished under the haze from those fires. In our youth, we could still visit this soft and opaque capital, the same one that Turner painted through veils of fog. We will not be surprised, then, to contemplate dangerous fires in Turner, like The Burning of the Houses of Parliament (1835), or the mobile smoke of steamboats spitting sooty clouds from their smokestacks, like those of the tugboat towing The Fighting Temeraire (1838) toward its last berth, or sunsets where prodigious golds fight in landscapes against opa- que dampness, as in Fingal's Cave on the Island of Staffa (1832). He makes us see what he observed: the England and Scotland of his time, not the France of the next century. But he rarely paints the landscapes of traditional England, as did Gainsborough or Constable-its fields, meadows, and gardens still plunged in the old society of the eighteenth century and its agrarian, aristocratic world. Rather, he makes us see the novelties of a country in the throes of a complete scientific, technological, and social renewal. To clarify both the Industrial Revolution as event and the canvases of Turner that reflect it, nature and geography give way in favor of the history of mechanical and social sciences: economics and sociology. SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="3">By Sail and by Steam On the strength of such interpretations, I wrote in my youth a short tract about these splendors. I thought there was sense and truth in it, since Turner's canvases spit flame like those new steamboats, and were thus quite the opposite of, for example, an earlier work by George Garrard, whose drawing follows the mechanical latticework suspended from the tackle of a docked wooden ship, next to The Warehouse of Samuel Whitbread the brewer, a hangar where all the old tools are kept... or, for that matter, the opposite of the masts of the Fighting Temeraire, neither vanquished by nor victorious over enemy ships, but drawn once and for all to scrap and to the graveyard of ships by a tugboat equipped with a combustion engine. A scale model of what is happening in society, the latter vessel kills the former. The sail is dead. Turner navigates under steam. Work and Its Machines But, at least if one is writing a scholarly article, such a statement will not do; one must enter into detail. As we know it and as Turner lived it, the Industrial Revolution had at least two consequences: the complete transfor- mation of society (which history and the social sciences teach us), and profound changes in the organization of the natural sciences and of their vision of the world. To clarify this evolution, I therefore compared in detail Garrard's painting with certain canvases of Turner. Garrard demonstrates that work uses sources of power like men's bodies, horses, or waterfalls . . . and means of transmission like cables, pulleys, and winches. All the rational mechanics of the eighteenth century are thus laid out in the tackle of these sailing ships and in the port equipment, as if the concrete reality of crafts expressed the dynamics of solids and fluids, and even projected itself, through the painter's brush, into the universe of the fine arts. As a result, the brewer's signboard, as Garrard draws it, not only describes the world of work as the painter sees it, but also-though doubtless involuntarily-it describes the sciences whose theories arise from these tools and in return improve them. What we have here is an image of social history and of technical expertise. SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="4">The Case of Turner 9 Dynamics and Thermodynamics A similar diagnosis can be made of Turner's canvases. This fire, this smoke, this fog all emanate, of course, from these brand-new ships, from this new source of energy, industrial combustion, and from the modern heat engines that transform heat into a source of power, but which express, in their turn, a new scientific world, born in that period, on account of these tools, and in return contributing to their development. If Garrard illustrates, in a certain sense, Lagrange's Analytical Mechanics, his contemporary, Turner, stages Carnot's theory of heat en- gines, written at the same time. The two works translate the two dynamics-the old one of "cold" power, and the new thermodynamics, whose name would be born later, and which replaced the old thermology of hearths and fireplaces, of household combustion. The change of draughtsmanship and of color palette points to the evolution between two systems of tools, two sets of machines, two conceptions of work. In short, two worlds conceived by--if not born of-these two sciences. The Old World and the New As if in two small-scale models, dense with meaning and truth, the comparison of the two canvases and their two creators thus summarized the gestures and acts of their times-all of society and the lived world, the perception of colors and of limits, real things and man-made tools, concrete hands-on practice and scientific theory--with science, in the work of Lagrange or Carnot, summarizing it all in a few words or theorems. From one vignette to another, one complete and entire world had given way to another, new one. Before our universe of communication made of us the children of Hermes, we lived as the daughters of fire and the sons of Prometheus, forgetful of our parents, who were followers of Hercules, the hero of work done by wooden club. Garrard draws the Herculean levers and the calcula- tions of Lagrange, both cool, while Turner paints the Promethean furnaces and the meditations of the young Carnot. I was thus able to demonstrate a continuity running from the history of science and social science to the fine arts. SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="5">10 Michel Serres Objective, Subjective It was stunning to me, this exact commonality of views between scien- tists and artists. It was as if the latter had conceived the same ideas as the former, in the same universe and in the same time--without, of course, their knowing or being able to influence one another. The parallel held, down to the smallest detail: on the one hand, the techniques of color and draughtsmanship; on the other hand, theoretical principles like the heat source and heat sink or the cycle of heat engines. Seeming to penetrate into matter in fusion, the canvases of Turner efface the boundaries of things and make their limits tremble. It's as if the wisp where molecules quiver had taken the place of the solid crystal and its precise contours: the outline is lost, on the canvas, in favor of a fuzzy- edged cloud. Even the techniques of the two painters confirmed the results of this historical analysis. Consequently, the whole critical perspective changed. Far from the consciousness of the artist, far from his body and the fine and qualitative perception of his senses, it entered directly into matter itself and the things of the world. These objective transformations plunged these works of art into an ensemble as far as possible from the subjective intentions of impres- sionism A la Manet. Criticism had a new exactness at its disposal. (Later, I also detected a similar objectivity in Impressionism, through an analysis of the sciences of its time.) Convinced by the dazzling and rigorous detail of a parallel that opened another dimension of analysis, I never reconsidered these results. Until very recently. A New Library Inside a Refrigerator But now, here is something new, come not from heat, but from cold. Results obtained via core samples drilled through layers of ice in the glaciers of Greenland have laid waste my old intuition, which had sprung from the history of the natural and social sciences. Falling every year in these zones close to the North Pole, snow forms strata that eventually harden into layers of ice covered by the snowfall of each succeeding year. Little by little an ensemble of horizontal "pages" forms, which is then vertically cut via the drilled core samples. The ele- ments suspended in the air are captured by the snow, season after season, and are set down with the snow and stay there, preserved by pressure and SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="6">The Case of Turner 11 cold. Chemical analysis of these elements, prisoners from that moment on in each of these successive strata, reveals the state of the atmosphere in the very year of each snowfall; it makes legible, as in an open book read page by page, the diverse climatic moments of eras whose dates and memory we had often lost. Writing without Humans The first bronze industry, for example, emitted and dispersed its byproducts in the world atmosphere. They fell and were preserved here, stable and faithful, as in a refrigerator. By reexamining them, therefore, we can now date to the precise year the appearance of that primitive industry, and we can reliably identify the alloys that our ancestors cast. In this new genre of book, a certain prehistory finds its writing. We can no longer believe, arrogantly, that only humanity knows how to write! Right down in the ice is a secure archive, whose print is made of truthful remains-an exact timepiece and an unvarying conservatory. Recently deciphered, an entire ancient and modem history emerges from this recent and permanent library, rigorous and precise in its datings. More than the fragile archives written on stone, papyrus, parchment, or incunabula, better than the perverse deceits of the powerful or the resent- ful, the physical world knows how to write, to engrave, to store in long- term memory, to preserve, and ultimately to restore objectively these ancient and faithful monuments. Are we seeing a change in the medium of annals, and thus in the specialization of historians? Instead of spending their vacations in the shady warmth of libraries, should they head off to the glaciers? They would thereby gain the happiness and relief of freedom from suspicion: snow and ice are unsullied by lies. Though subtle, God does not cheat. A Volcanic Eruption Empurples the Atmosphere Nor do I, alas! In the years when Turner was painting his sooty and pyrotechnical canvases, Tambora, a 9,000-foot volcano in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia, exploded suddenly, spewing clouds of burning ash into the upper atmosphere. Terrestrial attraction long held them above the equatorial belt like a satellite. Later, they dispersed toward the temperate SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="7">12 Michel Serres zones and finally over the poles, where they fell with the snow, settled there, and were preserved. The core samples in which they are found today attest that the island-and then the whole globe--endured on that day of wrath and in the months that followed one of the most frightening erup- tions in the recent history of the planet. One can still see, in Indonesia and elsewhere, superb sunrises and sunsets through the ashen veil of smoking volcanoes. Similarly, in recent years, we have often admired the red and gold magnificence of sunsets in cities polluted by the chemical industry. The more chemical effluents sully- ing the air, the better is light refracted in chromatic glories, luxuriously deployed. Thus, chemical analysis and the discovery of a bank of forgotten data transform official memory, and our perceptual experiences bring the past to life. But what did the contemporaries of Turner see? The Return of Nature? Thanks to Tambora, in those years, London and England-among other neighboring countries-lay under a cloud of volcanic ash spewed up from Indonesia, and were regaled with lacquered shadows at noon, with winy dawns and carnelian dusks. Turner simply painted their visible reality, for an honest artist describes what he has before his eyes more and better than what he thinks (which everybody, himself included, makes fun of, and rightly so). Authorized to be less articulate, the painter sees better than anyone. To be sure, Turner painted steamships and fires of all sorts, but the sieve of ashen fog that dropped like a veil between-things as they usually are and his strange canvases--did this ashy screen come from the eruption of that volcano in the Sunda Islands, or from the social reflections of the Industrial Revolution? Did it come from the phenomena of nature or from the effects of society? Were the air, the light, and the sky of London direct manifestations of telluric powers, or were they indirect manifestations of relations of force remodeled by fire-driven machines and the factory proletariat? Since the immediate moves more quickly than the mediated, geophysics seems more powerful than economic history-Tambora more powerful than Marxist analysis. Was I mistaken? I am ready to admit it. Certainly, a third of a century ago, no one would have dreamed that a library might lie under ice fields and that it would be enough to sound it to recall and date events. A lack cannot be considered a fault. Still, this error SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="8">The Case of Turner 13 of mine requires us to reconsider an equilibrium and reweigh a thought: what are the relative weights of the human sciences and the natural scien- ces, of representations and of phenomena, of causes and of things? Can we weigh in the balance the effects of these two mouths of fire-the boilers of industry and Tambora's crater? Following the same laws, do the multi- plication of the former and the expansion of the vapors pouring from the latter lead to the same consequences? The case of Turner thus offers an opportunity to reconsider the relations between the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities, so as to describe this return to things themselves. II. Hard Sciences and Social Sciences Generalization: Dating As a source of energy and a reason for changes in perception, the volcano and its byproducts seem to displace the boiler and its vapors, just as the ice field replaces the book, and the ice strata replace its pages. Is the eruption more significant than the revolution? Does geophysics weigh more heavily than economic history? The hard sciences today are invading, here and there, areas formerly the exclusive property of the human and social sciences. My error (or my equivocation) in the case of Turner seems like a sign of changing times. Can one generalize from these results? Yes. The greatest historical inventions of the last 30 years have come from this same direction, while the human sciences, despite their promise, have seemed to be at a standstill. Imprisoned in language, what social discipline could have discovered a library in the ice? Almost all the sciences of the inanimate or of the living have recently invented techniques of dating suited to reveal the flow of time in the universe and its components. Astrophysics gives ages to galaxies and stars, calculating their birth and predicting their death; it clocks the planets, evaluating their formation, decay, and cooling. Geophysics dates the con- tinents, measuring the slippage of tectonic plates over the earth's internal fires. Chemistry clocks molecules; physics, atoms. For biology, viruses, diseases, species, cells and pollens appear, exist, and are extinguished... This coherent set of techniques expresses an impulse toward temporality shared by all the exact sciences. Through these diverse clocks-more SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="9">14 Michel Serres "givens" than constructs-the things of this world reenter history, each one beating its own time. Generalization: Histories A hundred discoveries were born from this, and human history was thereby changed. If, after a battle, mothers mourned a thousand dead, what can we say about the epidemic that followed the army's peaceful passage through the countryside, killing a hundred times more people than the battle did? Does the unintentional history of microbes win out, at least demographically, over the intentional history of politicians and sol- diers? The history of climate shows us that the flu, imported to a newly- discovered America thanks to a lull in the pattern of storms, did more damage than the cruelty of Cortez's soldiers. At Waterloo, the grenadiers of the Imperial Guard were floundering in water up to their shoulders, for that day it had rained the rainfall of the century. After General Winter, the catastrophic deluge. How, then, are we to evaluate the supposedly brilliant strategies of Wellington and Napoleon? What wins or loses battles and overturns or builds empires? Infection? Meteorology? Only geology and botany have been able to demonstrate the authenticity of Leonardo's Virgin of the Rocks at the Louvre, and the inauthenticity of the one in London: subtly different, the two background landscapes show, in one case, species that would have perished on those rocks, and, in the other, plants adapted to that soil. The artist-scientist would never have painted against nature! The time of groups is transformed by the fluctuations of climate and microbes. As a result, our understanding of causality changes. Tactics count less toward victory than do rain or plague. Geology's objectivity can separate the true from the false in a work of art. Rainfall, diseases, the exchange of viruses, the growth of plants, and the variety of soils impose their own time on human time, and societies must pay attention, on pain of death. The world seen through Turner's canvases can now be dated by refer- ence to Greenland: here is just one particular case of a general movement in which the hard sciences reevaluate the quantities of time, discovering there events otherwise inaccessible, rethinking the flow of time itself. SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="10">The Case of Turner 15 Generalization: The Flow of Time There's more. How much leisure time have we lost, of late and long ago, in fruitless discussions about the laws of history and of events, debates that opposed two loquacious armies: those who fight for causality and against "chance," and those who, considering Cleopatra's nose, argue that circumstances win out over regularities, even over the long term? As com- edy would have it, even political positions have been determined in such debates, debates invalidated by the hard sciences with a stroke of the pen almost a century ago, unbeknownst to the debaters. Unpredictable, then, and yet somehow determined-can historical time from now on do without models drawn from chaos theory, itself born of theorems as old as those of Hadamard and Poincar6? Suddenly, the old discussions about the laws of evolution or the logic of history become obsolete. Our initial hesitations over the retrospective judgment of Turner's canvases derive from these discoveries: what Bergson called "the retrograde movement of the true" accompanies this obvious fact: that the time of certain things-and certainly the time of history-cannot be foreseen, just as tempests cannot be foreseen, but that this time can be calculated deterministically once the event itself has happened. When we consider time as running downstream, the mathematical rationality of cal- culation and the observed evolution of most physical processes give the victory to Cleopatra's nose. When we look upstream at time as past, the victory goes to the proponents of causes and reasons. How can we not see that the history of humanity and of groups evolves chaotically, in today's theoretical sense of the term? How can we not feel that time percolates rather than flows? Far from flowing in laminar and continuous lines, like a well-behaved river under a bridge, upstream to downstream, time descends, turns back on itself, stops, starts, bifurcates ten times, divides, and blends, caught up in whirlpools and counter-currents, hesitant, aleatory, uncertain and fluctuating, multi- plied into a thousand beds like the Yukon River. Sometimes time passes, sometimes not; but when it passes, it does so as if through a colander. Colander comes from the Latin colare, to filter, and this filter or percolator supplies the best model for the flow of time. Sudden explosions, quick crises, periods of stagnant boredom, burdensome or foolish regressions, and long blockages, but also rigorous linkages and suddenly accelerated progress, meet and blend in scientific time as in the intimacy of the soul, in meteorology as in river basins. Would we have understood such obvious facts without the theory of percolation? This theory rediscovers the oldest SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="11">16 Michel Serres of intuitions, confirmed by linguistics: in Indo-European languages, the word time [temps] goes back to the aleatory mixtures of the temperaments, of intemperate weather, of tempests and temperature. If the time of a planet and the time of a river can have such subtlety, what about historical time? We can say, at the very least, that history is chaotic, that it percolates. Simultaneously unpredictable and deterministic, its course blends all paces. This is where we are today. A few decades ago, we knew very little about the nature of processes. Without a doubt, we will discover more about it as we enter more into both the inanimate and the living aspects of processes themselves. Reciprocal Ignorance Let us return to the debates over chance and causality: does light ever come from quarrels? No, it always comes from elsewhere and from unex- pected places. It shines from Poincare or from de Gennes, as far as possible from historical controversies. It shoots forth from Greenland and Tambora to bring agreement to Marxists and anti-Marxists, whose debate was as far as possible from such heat and cold! But the sterility of debates is preceded by their absence: experts in economic history take no account of plate tectonics, and specialists in glaciology couldn't care less about sociology. Even as they renew the idea of time's percolating flow, geophysicists ignore history; even as masses of people die in earthquakes or eruptions, geophysics leaves historians indif- ferent. In short, society is not concerned with nature, and nature is even less concerned with society. The dialogue does not take place. By proclaiming loudly that the fine arts, like mental illness or scientific discoveries, are socially determined, do we keep ourselves from hearing the thunder of even volcanoes? On the other hand, how many epis- temologies have not heard the noise of Nagasaki? In physics, an experi- ment has no social effects. Scientific ideas must deafen us, if we can hear neither eruptions nor atomic bombs! In the first of these two cases, social science forgets climate-the atmosphere itself and its opacities, the earth and its instabilities. In the second, indifferent to humanity, the hard scien- ces seem to ignore war, its murders and its miseries, and death, received or given. Does the ear's hearing or the eye's vision improve according to the deafening or blinding of the other? SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="12">The Case of Turner 17 Yet groups of mortals do live in the world: this obvious fact, accessible to laypeople, is invisible to the division of the disciplines. Where, then, does this reciprocal blindness and deafness come from, the absence of contact between kinds of knowledge so divided that their exclusive limits produce, more than error, the lacunary ignorance of an empty set? If only the twins stopped arguing, would they be able to hear what people outside the family are saying? Will we ever deceive ourselves by anything but corporatism? Because we're so fond of explaining the universe and history according to the groups that we belong to, does our specialization forever shut our eyes and close our ears? Separations, Rapprochements Having seen madness up close in both poor and rich, we have never thought that it could be reduced to a political decision about justice. Change group or culture, change environment or custom, and mental ill- nesses will still exist, stable in reality under their unstable names. Having worked on the question under all latitudes and all social systems, we would never believe that the objects of biological or physical science follow the coalitions of scientists, politicians, ideologies, or financiers: from laboratory to hospital, from democracy to tyranny, the same microbes attack the same organisms. The possibility of repeating an experiment proves nothing as far as principles go, but it says a lot about the relativity of groups of observers. Having seen electrons and heavenly objects turn, we cannot believe that left and right depend on cultural or political choices, for they preexist in planetary movement and the spinning of subatomic particles, both of which are so foreign to our disputes that, if the latter were extinguished, the macro- and nano-worlds would continue to turn in the same direction. Worse still, we were even able to demonstrate that the emergence of the natural sciences in 5th- and 6th-century BC Greece was accompanied by a sinister series of trials in which the assembled people condemned the observers of things and of the heavens, accusing them of forgetting human affairs. It sounds like our contemporary guardians of the anthropomorphic order ruling the idea of the Natural Contract out of bounds! The human sciences, being primitive, blocked the birth of the objective sciences. The cause-police kept an eye on the observatory of things. But for several centuries now, who has better dealt with human causes-hunger, disease, miseries of all sorts-than those who consider things? Being concerned SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="13">18 Michel Serres with the things of the world, we advance human affairs. Conversely, im- proving human affairs, we progress in the understanding of the world. Knowledge springs from their intersection. Intersections Yes, intelligence, discovery and invention--in short, the truth--are born from filling out the sets emptied by reciprocal deafness or blindness. Filled back up, these intersections have as much to do with nature and society as they do with science and the humanities. If the humanities mean something, then they must define humanity, and in fact they never stop talking about identity-in culture, in gender, in language. How, then, to define this identity in its turn? Tautologically, identity means that an individual is no one other than him- or herself. The self the same as the self: this is the principle of identity, a foundation of thought, of logic, and of individuation. To verify a person's identity, customs examines his or her passport, whose first page announces a first name, last name, height, eye color, nationality... information that expresses associations of belonging: to the set of people with the same name, the same body type, the same language, and so on. I am such and such an individual and I belong, among other things, to one subset, "male," and to another, "French-speaking," etc. Logic and mathematics designate belonging and identity under two different signs, and confusing them leads to grave errors. What is racism, then? The reduction of an individual's identity to one of the categories to which he or she belongs. So it is said of someone, "he's African," "she's a woman," "he's Chicano," and so on. Reducing identity to a simple act of belonging, the unfortunately all-too-common expressions "cultural identity," "masculine identity," or "feminine identity" express racism in its pure form. You are yourself; thou art thou; we cannot be reduced to a gender, nor to a sex, nor to a language, nor to a culture. The confusion between belonging and identity leads to more than logical and formal errors: it leads to moral wrongs and to the crimes of racism. SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="14">The Case of Turner 19 Multiplicity of Overlappings So the person lives in the place where many subsets overlap: identity is born from the intersections of belonging. The richness of the former depends, we know well, on the number of the latter. Similarly, a man of culture, informed about his own culture and happy to belong to it, has no right to this title unless he knows and appreciates many cultures-unless he cultivates their intersections. The depth of the former depends, we know well, on the number of the latter. Similarly, a scientist or scholar has no right to that title unless, ceasing to defend her own disciples or her own discipline, she stops explaining everything from her discipline's point of view, but admires other dis- ciplines, far or near, and learns from them. Identity comes from the intersections of belonging; culture comes from the intersections of cultures; discovery or true invention springs from the intersections of disciplines. As a result, the hard sciences and the humanities find themselves on the same footing as far as truth is concerned. What one can say about humanist culture can also be said about scientific truth: multiculturalism in the former equals interdisciplinarity in the latter. The Two Maps are Projected on Each Other To try to speak the truth about Turner's canvases, I should therefore travel the world, from the Sunda Islands to Greenland, before returning to the London fog. I should also move from geology to glaciology, before returning to sociology, economics, the history of science and the history of art. I must cross borders and seas, on Earth as much as in the country of Encyclopedia. The question of truth, and therefore of discovery, is thus posed in the same way as the question of culture or cultures. Just as there are French, Italian, and Mexican cultures, so official knowledge is divided into provin- ces: logic, astronomy, sociology ... and scholarly or scientific truth haunts the intersections between disciplines. Just as the passion for belonging often engenders violence and human misery, so belonging to a single branch of knowledge engenders corporatism. Conversely, the invention of truth is born from the moving intersec- tions of specializations-here, from an overlapping of nature and society, from a projection of two world maps, one on the other. The truth on SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="15">20 Michel Serres Turner's canvases passes through the Malaysian archipelago, the icefield, and England. This first intersection is geographical and cultural. And then through another intersection, but of the same form, between university dis- ciplines: geophysics, chemistry, sociology, and history of art. One map is projected on the other. University, Universality Like the world and like knowledge, the university is also divided into provinces linked in relations of dominance, some having more power than others. And here, perhaps, we touch on the gravest danger for today's universities: the danger of losing, through provincialism, the truth of their name, and the fertility that this universality promises. Can discovery come about in a closed group, ranged in battle order, in which all defend only their own interests? Why does truth always come from elsewhere, and not from the corporate body? Because the corporation does not concern itself with truth, but with money, with power, and with glory. The most authentic reductionisms always come from corporatism. Once a discipline or science settles in, it undertakes to explain the whole universe by its laws. One can surely diagnose this as a disease of youth. It struck the human sciences recently, as it has struck all nascent disciplines through history, from theology to mathematics and from physics to biol- ogy; the cognitive sciences today nurse ambitions on the same scale. The historian of science finds this dismal repetition of infantile arrogance strange. The monotony of it should play a role no less healthy than that of Popper's criterion. Far from meaning that one local law extends its jurisdiction everywhere, the universality of truth means that, escaping from the center of local "belongings," which are almost always infertile, it springs from border zones. It resounds from one point to another, far away, and sets the networks of their frontiers vibrating. Motley Universality Far from diffusing one culture out from a center, authentic univer- sality is accompanied by a radical decentering: it is defined by the bringing together of intersections. SubStance #83, 1997</page><page sequence="16">The Case of Turner 21 Individual or collective, my culture cannot be reduced to the customs of a tribe that got its religion from Palestine, its language and its law from Rome, its love for heresies from Bulgaria, and its rugby from England. Far from defining itself only from the inside, a culture emerges, develops, and flourishes by osmosis with others. The greatest Christian philosopher was born in North Africa; many French statesmen came from Italy; one of the best writers in the English language grew up speaking Polish. Collective or personal, a culture is defined by its intersections; otherwise, it decays and dies. That thing that wasn't yet called "French culture" (and just as well!) never shone brighter than in the seventeenth century, when it imitated the Greeks, the Romans, the Italians, and the Spanish; at its language's mo- ment of excellence, France was multiplying its imports. If, on the contrary, multiculturalism juxtaposes closed sets, it en- genders racism: brawls rage across the boundaries of nations, of neighbor- hoods, of languages, of gangs. Fortunately, the porous cultural Customs office cannot resist the propagation of fashions and ideas, the imitation of languages and of beautiful works of art, any better than it can resist the microbes of an epidemic or the acidic effluvia of Tambora. On Training No longer can students or teachers be trained in the social sciences without learning about the hard sciences: the historian and art critic need climatology and geophysics. Similarly, without humanistic training, scien- tists become dangerous through their expertise and power. Practice others, then: other men and women, other cultures, other dis- ciplines. Like the secret of discovery or the secret of tolerance, the secret of training resides in the voyage: the more you know about things outside your specialization, the more you will invent. The future of the university is in its universality. Become a generalist. The museum where Turner's work is displayed has its entry in the ice fields of Greenland, and its exit in Indonesia, in the hot crater of a volcano. Have we turned around the center of the Earth?
