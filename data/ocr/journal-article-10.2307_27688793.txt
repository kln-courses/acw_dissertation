G? teborg: ?str?m 1983. VIII, 69 S. 18 Taf. 6 Abb. (Studies in Mediterranean Archaeolo gy. Pocket-Books. 20.) 100 Kr. Whether or not one agrees with the idea of the 'Corpus of Cypriote Antiquities', Frankel's contribution is a welcome exception in the series since it is the first to present mainly provenanced material. This is a result of H. W. Catling's early 1950s surveys in Cyprus when he was a member of the Cyprus Survey and his subsequent donation of recovered sherd mate rial to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, where he eventually became Keeper of the Depart ment of Antiquities. Another departure from previous volumes therefore is the preponder ance of sherds as distinct from complete, but unprovenanced, pottery vessels. The 1400 illustrated entries constitute the Early and Middle Cypriot Bronze Age hold ings of the Ashmolean and while one would have liked to see the Late Cypriot included within the same covers the volume is already large enough and witness to the richness of this Oxford collection. Some 250 entries, consisting mostly of complete vessels with some figurines and metalwork, are from unknown prove nances. The remainder comes from 28 known sites with particularly fine assemblages from Dhenia Kafkalla and Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi (including Myres' tombs 1, 11 and 14). It was on the basis of this and additional material that Catling wrote his seminal 'Pat terns of Settlement in Bronze Age Cyprus*, OpAth 4, 1963, 129-169. Since it was appa rently not feasible to illustrate there the mate rial by which sites were allocated to periods this is the first time that the basis of attribu tions may be widely assessed. Naturally not all the pottery found its way to the Ashmolean, so fewer classes than Catling mentions for each site is hardly cause for surprise,? but additional ones could and do alter the picture. Moreover F., in spite of justifiable misgivings about pre vailing classification systems, has divided such pottery as WP [White Painted] into its sub types [I-VI] where Catling referred to it only by ware and hence we now have greater stylis tic precision to hand. This Catalogue essentially confirms Cat ling's allocations if one accepts the reliability of EC-MC [Early Cypriot - Middle Cypriot Bronze Ages] pottery for dating purposes. Ex ceptions include Arpera Mosphilia (Nos. 261-73) which here becomes MC, Kouklia Ev reti (Nos. 1134-6) which has a WP V sherd but is usually regarded as only starting in LC al though one may wonder if an earlier settlement did not exist there since MC material is poorly defined in the west and Kouklia was already important enough to attract LMIA imports (BCH 104, 1980, 793, Fig. 87), and Kaimakli Beuyuk Evritadhes (Nos. 851-9) here MC, in Catling LC, unless a mistake for Ayios Demet rianos. Where classes of pottery not mentioned by Catling are presented important new light is sometimes shed on the relevant sites. Thus Dhiorios Aloupotrypes (Nos. 636-732) is now seen to possess El-Lisht Ware,2 so confirming an axial role for the Bay of Morphou area in 1 See additional pottery from many of the same sites in Lund: CVA Sweden 1, Lund, 9 where, however, the sherds are not illustrated, contrary to those from Greece and Crete: why? 2 Overlooked by Kaplan in her survey: 'The Origin and Distribution of Tell el Yahudiyeh Ware* SIMA 62, 1980. She considers El-Lisht ware as part of Tell el Yahudiyeh ware; Frankel describes the latter rather unconventionally now as Black Punctured Ware: Nos. 885, 895.</page><page sequence="2">566 E. J. Peltenburg: Orphanides, Bronze Age Anthropomorphic Figurines East-West relations c. 1600 B.C. as suggested by the association of similar Eygptian pottery with Minoan wares at nearby Toumba tou Skourou (E. Vermeule, Toumba Tou Skourou, The Mound of Darkness, Boston). Occasional ly however the correlation between F. and Catling lacks precision. Thus the Krini Merra material (Nos. 1137-1229) could be helpful for assessing the occupation, if not necessarily construction, of the impressive fortress there, especially as Catling does not describe its pot tery. This material, however, apparently comes from three sites in the area and that from the fortress is not isolated. Since this and similar forts are dated to MCIII-LCIA it is interesting, but inconclusive, to note that only three of the 91 entries here post-date MCII. There are few errors in cross-references to Catling: Phlamoudi Vounari should be Catling MC 138, not 159, Vasilia Evremata, Catling p. 154, not p. 160. A map of site locations would have been helpful for non-specialists. This would have graphically displayed the bias of the collection, and the 1950 survey, to areas east of a line from Morphou to Akrotiri. Apart from the rare WP sherd from Kouklia, only material from Magounda Polis tis Chrysokhou (Nos. 1233-9) represents the west and these high quality pieces demonstrate connections with the Bay of Morphou rather than other parts of the west. This and other recent discoveries (e. g. BCH 100, 1976, 862) amply justify both a revi sion of Catling's E-MC maps (see most recent ly Cambridge Ancient History, 3rd ed. II, 190, Map 6), and more significantly, a closer exami nation of the criteria for pottery dating, one which must also be borne in mind in dealing with this catalogue. F. is well aware of the un certainties of dating this pottery: dates in fact are conspicuous by their absence. But the cent ral dilemma facing treatments of E-MC ar chaeology is highlighted here by his use of the chronological terms ECI-III, MC I?III, terms which in his major studies (e. g. 'Middle Cyp riot White Painted Pottery: An Analytical Study of the Decoration' SIMA 42, 1974) he refers to only in passing. The contents of these periods and hence their dates are questionable especially in earlier times and in regional terms and no amount of tinkering will overcome fun damental inadequacies of the system.3 This is increasingly clear from studies after 1977, the last year for the inclusion of references in this 1983 volume, a regrettable aspect of the work. If, for example, conclusions drawn from exca vations at Alambra are correct, then the d?fini tion of pottery styles and their allocation to the periods used here will need thorough re-ap praisal (see RDAC 1982, 31-36). Other major post-1977 publications particu larly relevant to this work include S. Kromholz, 'The Bronze Age Necropolis at Ayia Paraskevi (Nicosia): Unpublished Tombs in the Cyprus Museum*, SIMA Pocketbook 17, 1982 and BCH 98, 1974, 837-9; 105, 1981, 977-8 for Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi (Nos. 1243-1329) and S. Al-Radi, 'Phlamoudhi Vou nari: a Sanctuary Site in Cyprus*, SIMA 65, 1983 for Phlamoudhi Vounari (Nos. 13 50-1). There are a few typographical errors or over sights: p. 5, n. 2 should be Levant XIII, 1981 and the p. 45 missing reference to Vickers is probably AJA 79, 1975, 2^2- Some drawings may need to be checked.4 By virtue of the provenanced material alone this must rank as the most informative volume of the SIMA corpus to date. F. not only brings to it his well known expertise in E-MC ceramics but also provides the most succinct defense of the notion of a Cypriot corpus, one that rightly takes into account changing per spectives and methods of investigating the past (5-6). His valuable contribution therefore does much to establish the merit of the series as a whole. In contrast to the above volume, Orphanides' MA thesis, published as SIMA Pocket Book 20, treats only one class of objects, Bronze Age anthropomorphic figurines, from another well known collection, that of Luigi Palma di Cesnola in New York. The contrast goes further as all save one of the 17 presented here (No. 6) have been published before. Since there has been a recent spate of publications dealing with Cypriot figurines (see L. ?strom, J. Des Gagniers and V. Karageorghis, P. Fluorentzos, J. Karageorghis and R. Merril 3 Merrillees for example abandons the entire ECIC period to which Frankel allocates mate rial from Bellapais Vounous Tomb 92 (Nos. 290-298): see R. Merrillees, 'The Absolute Chronology of the Bronze Age in Cyprus*, RDAC 1977, 44-45. 4 Two examples of disconcerting inconsis tencies must suffice here. No. 91 has a depres sed ovoid body at odds with the perked-up appearance of the vessel in SCE IV. iA Fig. CVII. 4 and 'Ancient Cyprus* 14, Fig. I a. 2. No. 885 has only a shoulder decoration which is most unorthodox for this class. Kaplan (see n. 2) shows it with the typical lower body de coration also, Fig. 87c.</page><page sequence="3">B. Borell-Seidel: Dierichs, Das Bild des Greifen s 6l lees in the Bibliography, 54-59) it is reasonable to ask what is the special contribution of this study. Its format, though lacking chapter num bers, is straight-forward. Each figurine is de scribed in a catalogue (5-19), classified accord ing to type with long lists of comparanda (20-29), a derivative account of wares and less so of decoration (30-36), their foreign relations and chronology (37-44) and lastly their signifi cance and use (45-47) together with a helpful concordance (61). There is a photo of each fi gurine, but no drawing with profiles. The ap proach therefore is conventional and follows closely the methods established long ago in the first volumes of the 'Swedish Cyprus Expedi tion*. The author divides his 17 figures into seven types but lays no claim to a comprehensive classification. Most are allegedly from Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi and Alambra in the centre of the island. The two Mycenaean ones (Nos. 7, 17) are also attributed to Alambra but they probably come from a different locality than the E-MC ones (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 11). It is there fore a limited study, its chief usefulness being a handy reference to a choice selection of Bronze Age figurines with up-to-date references. Foreign parallels are sought for the inspira tion behind the figurines, their significance and use, but this is to overlook any influence from the native population in Cyprus at the begin ning of the Bronze Age. To deny them a for mative and enduring role in these matters is to over-simplify issues, as are far-fetched appeals to the idea of Egyptian ushabtis (which begin only in the Middle Kingdom) as explanatory devices (45-6). That continuity existed is clear not only from the same funerary context of earlier figurines but also from the remarkable figurine of chalcolithic cruciform type ex ecuted in Bronze Age Red Polished pottery which Flourentzos recently published, OpAth 14, 1982, 25, PHI, 3-5. Otherwise, the author has a welcome open approach to the use and significance of fi gurines. Wary of ethnographic explanations (3) he concludes that many represent Astarte and were funerary in nature, both concensus posi tions. The latter is conditioned by the funerary nature of our sample however: settlements are also beginning to yield figures (see RDAC 1981, Pl X. 2). While not decrying the role of traditional stylistic analysis as an interpretative tool, real advances in our understanding of these representations seem now more likely to be gained from different approaches such as quantitative examination of morphology, spa tial and contextual analyses and for this a rigor ous and comprehensive study, as well of course as more and better quality data, are desirable.
