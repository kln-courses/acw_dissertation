<plain_text><page sequence="1">Birds of tropical America.-Alexander F. Skutch. 1983. Austin, Texas, University of Texas Press. 305 pp. $29.95.-Spanning a career that now exceeds half a century, Skutch is clearly the most prolific contrib- utor to knowledge of the natural history of neotrop- ical birds, especially their nesting habits. He has ac- complished this task through long and patient observation at hundreds of nests of many species. This volume, despite a more inclusive title, presents information on 34 species of nonpasserines. The ma- jor taxa included are tinamous (2 species), pigeons and doves (6), cuckoos (2), trogons (6), kingfishers (2), motmots (5), toucans (4), and one each of cha- chalaca, wood-quail, ani, potoo, jacamar, puffbird, and barbet. All of these life histories have been published before, most in Auk, Wilson Bulletin, Condor, and Ibis between 1937 and 1971. The stated goals of this volume are to update those life histories and make them more generally avail- able in book form. I checked only a few of the orig- inals and came away with the impression that changes were mostly of an editorial nature. In addition, Skutch notes that, with this volume, he hopes to convey both the "science of ornithology" and the "poetry of birds." On the plus side, Skutch conveys the excitement of field study of birds, of discovery of facts about the birds and their environments. Less positively, this is done with little presentation of data to support his conclusions except nest and egg dimensions and at- tentive periods. Further, Skutch continues his strong negative tone about snakes and other predators that feed on birds and their eggs or nestlings. That per- spective does not reflect ecological and evolutionary reality. I feel that the tropical forest that I enjoy so much would be diminished as much by loss of snakes and other predators as by the loss of birds. Treatment among the species is variable (2-22 pages) with most containing sections devoted to the nest, eggs and incubation, and nestlings. Other sec- tions are scattered among the species accounts. For species with special life history attributes, such as the communal nesting of anis, sections are devoted to those subjects. For the trogons, a classification of tro- gons by nest type is provided. Short postscripts of recent information are provided for selected species. Skutch's basic natural history information pro- vides tantalizing glimpses of ecological and evolu- tionary pattern. The reader learns, for example, that the Resplendent Quetzal, Mountain Trogon, and the Blue-throated Green Motmot develop feathers faster as nestlings than their lowland cousins, presumably due to the need for more thermoregulatory control in the cooler highlands. Or, the white eggs of Squir- rel Cuckoos are stained by fresh leaves in the nest, a</page><page sequence="2">October 1983] Reviews 1015 fact that may reduce their visibility to predators. But much information is anecdotal [a "surprisingly large" insect fed to a day old nestling (p. 132)-how large?] or anthropomorphic [flights of male quetzals that "spring from sheer exuberance" but are not used "in courtship" or "finding food" (p. 150)]. Editorially, the book could have been improved by several actions. Presentation of nearly all quantita- tive data in both English and metric units seems a waste of space. Skutch mentions plants used for food or nesting substrates but gives only English or Span- ish common names. Why not include the scientific names to improve the value of the text? All 34 species are illustrated with drawings by Dana Gardner. These are of variable quality, with the Com- mon Potoo almost unrecognizable. In many cases, the birds are provided with a vegetation substrate or background that conveys something of the birds' en- vironment. Selected photos of the birds and their habitats are a valuable addition, although some are not in sharp focus. In summary, Alexander Skutch continues to be the primary contributor to neotropical ornithology with publication of yet another book of life histories. Al- though I find it difficult to sit down and read them, these and his other life histories will be the primary source of natural-history information for many years to come.-JAMES R.
