<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN I907. IN my former article, " Contemporary Philosophy in Germany ( I906)," 1 I expressed the view that the development of Ger- man philosophical speculation appeared to repeat "on a new basis the development of idealism from Kant to Hegel." I used the phrase ' on a new basis' intentionally; for a blind, senseless repetition, which could only be reaction in the worst meaning, is of course out of the question. The ' new basis' is given in the fixation of the deepest Kantian principles. The clear sepa- ration of the transcendental and psychological elements, and especially the sharp sundering of the transcendental and meta- physical views of reality, are in general carried further and with severer logic by those men who go beyond Kant, Fichte, and Schelling than was the case with their great prototypes. Rickert is correct when he says: " One need have no fear that we shall be obliged again to pass through the process of development from Kant to Fichte, from Fichte to the romanticism of Schelling or Schopenhauer, and from there to Hegel. As we find them, we cannot use the systems of the past. Our time brings new prob- lems that demand new answers, and in historical life nothing has ever repeated itself. But one should not be blind to the fact that Kantian and post-Kantian idealism is a treasure-house of thoughts that we have not yet minted, out of which we can draw a pleni- tude of valuable stimuli, when we have to struggle with the philosophical problems of our age." 2 In the same spirit I expressed myself in my last annual report on the relation of con- temporary philosophy to the classical past. As far as I am able to survey the production of the past year, I can only discover confirmation of the view I then expressed on the aims and tend- encies of modern investigation. Kant is still the ideal focal point; his influence continues to widen. 1 PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, Vol. XVI, pp. 237 if. 2 Die Philosophie im Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts.

In agreement with my perspective, sketched in my last report, the fantastic excess of this tendency is more and more checked by sober inquiry, and the philosophical literature of I907 exhibits, in general, a more solid character than that of i906. As the theoretical situation has naturally undergone no radical change in the course of a single year, I may use my former classification and disposition of subject-matter. First of all, I wish to call attention to one phenomenon, which for a long time has been in course of preparation, and which came to the fullest development last year: the adjustment be- tween philosophy and science, which in a characteristic way was brought about by both sides, by the philosophers not less than by scientific investigators. Indeed, it was through the Kantian philosophy that occasion was offered for this reciprocal activity. The question as to the foundation of experience, however gener- ally interpreted, raised the further question as to the nature of the separate scientific experiences. Now Kant, in addition to his chief work, which serves neither as a foundation of psychology nor of mathematical physics, but is an explanation of a concep- tion of nature comprehending both inner and outer phenomena, wrote a series of works dealing with the concrete principles of the separate disciplines of physics, jurisprudence, and anthro- pology. In Schelling and Hegel this tendency to unite philoso- phy and the investigation of particular phenomena is still more markedly developed. And so neo-Kantianism assumed to a large extent the inheritance of the master, in the sense of demanding a descent from the heights of abstract universality to the sphere of scientific inquiry. The Marburg School opened the road to mathematical physics, Rickert the road to history, Natorp and Stammnler to sociology. Of late, physical and especially mathe- matical problems have gained the ascendency to such a degree as to threaten the obscuration of general philosophical interest. Consequent upon this is the current high appreciation and attention accorded to Leibniz. This attention is directed not so much to his metaphysical and cosmological ideas as to his</page><page sequence="3">402 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVII. achievements in mathematics, epistemology, and the philosophy of nature. On the other hand, investigators in the special sci- ences, - mathematicians, physicists, psychologists, biologists, historians, sociologists,- are seeking a philosophical basis for their methods and aims. Consequently, the cords that bind the sciences and philosophy together grow stronger, and questions of the right, aim, and limitations of such union become more prominent. This is especially shown by two large collective works, which are the more important, because the most distinguished exponents of German philosophy express their views here: The Festschrift dedicated to Kuno Fischer (second, corrected edition, published by Winter, Heidelberg), entitled Die Philosophie im Beginn des zwanzigsten Jakrhunderts, and the volume, Systematische Philoso- phie, forming a part of Hinneberg's Kultur der Gegenwart (Teub- ner). These volumes raise the consideration of three chief prob- lems: (i) the problem of the relationship between science and philosophy in general; (2) how far the special sciences admit of philosophical foundation; (3) the question of the classification of the sciences from a philosophical point of view. All three ques- tions, whose interdependence is evident, have been raised in modern philosophical investigation. They are especially dis- cussed in the two collective works already mentioned and in others also. Stumpf attempts to answer the first question in an address entitled Die Wiedergeburt der Philosophie (Berlin, Universitiitsbuchdruckerei, I 907). This is the rectoral ad- dress, delivered by Stumpf in October, I907, at the University of Berlin. Stumpf maintains a middle position between the extremes of rationalism and empiricism. The rationalistic ex- treme, which consists in the deduction of all empirical form and content from an ultimate philosophical principle, is Hegel's position. The empiristic extreme, the way for which was pre- pared by Comte, finds its complete exposition in Avenarius, whose empiristic system limits the business of philosophy to the acquisition of the most general concepts formed within the special sciences and weighs their chances of survival in terms of their economic value. Between these two extremes there are two</page><page sequence="4">No. 4.1 GERMAA PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 403 other points of view, one of them represented by Kant, i. e., rationalism, the other represented by Wundt, a view closely akin to empiricism. Kant's transcendental idealism sets out to deduce formal principles of philosophy a priori. The critical empiricism of Wundt 1 assigns to philosophy the task of assimilating the de- liverances of the special sciences into a system free from inner contradiction. He does not go so far as Kant or even so far as Hegel, as he does not concede to philosophy the foundation but only the superstructure. He goes further, however, than does Avenarius in ascribing to philosophy a productive value. These four views are of basic significance. All others are derivatives of them by combination or mediation. Stumpf takes a mediating position. He distinguishes between aprioristic and empiristic philosophy, and, although he recognizes the unquestionable ad- vantages of the former in Hegel and Schelling, he decides for the latter as more fruitful and solid. He demands of philosophy, primarily, thorough acquaintance with natural science, because the chief problems are to be sought here. Nevertheless, the philosopher is not to be placed in the same category as the inves- tigator of nature. Neither the mere physicist (or mathematician) nor the epistemologist, but only a thinker acquainted with both realms of thought could definitively solve this problem. Stumpf is thinking here especially of the origin of the notion of number, the doctrine of probability, and atomism. Also on the primeval question of the relation between the physical and psychical, Stumpf looks for light from a union of epistemology and empirical science. He is not, however, of the opinion that natural science can furnish an adequate basis for philosophy, but concedes prior- ity to spirit, as this is for us the only immediate. In this respect Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Lotze are right; but the revival of the philosophy of identity is unconditionally rejected by Stumpf. He expects from the future philosophical genius a combination of the Kantian and Leibnizian spirit. Wundt's definition concedes fewer prerogatives to philosophy. His view is expressed in an essay, Metaphysik, published in the I Heinrich Gomperz has lately taken this view, at least as a program, in his Methodologie, the first volume of his Weltanschauungslehre.</page><page sequence="5">404 TIE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. above mentioned collective work, Kultur der Gegenwart. " Meta- physics," he says, " is the attempt to formulate a Weltanschauung that unifies the component elements of our particular knowledge, the attempt being based on the total scientific consciousness of an age or on the especially conspicuous content of the same." Wundt's definition of metaphysics, as shown by his other works, is essentially identical with his definition of philosophy. It is entirely clear that metaphysics and philosophy, if they are merely a combination of the results of the special sciences into a system free from contradiction, must be dependent on the variations within these special disciplines, and subordinate to them in form and content. This view is very remote from Kant's. Kant sees the foundation of philosophy in the synthetic transcendental logic. The combination of the given into a system free from contradiction is, on the contrary, a function of general, formal logic, and this must be regarded by Wundt as an instrument of philosophical investigation. Wundt sketches in this essay an in- teresting plan of the evolutionary history of metaphysic, which develops in three stadia, that of poetical, dialectic, and critical metaphysics. In the works of Haeckel, Mach, and Ostwald on the philosophy of nature, - works that are only metaphysical in appearance, - one finds successively these three stadia repre- sented. Dilthey and Paulsen ascribe to philosophy a greater independence than do Wundt and Stumpf. Dilthey, in his essay, Das Wesen der Philosophie (in Kultur der Gegenwart), attempts to introduce unity into the body of historical definitions. Three essential tendencies in philosophy are dis- tinguished by Dilthey, viz., positivism, objective idealism, and idealism of inner freedom. The inadequacy of metaphysics with reference to ultimate determinations, does not mean its loss of value. " The relativity of every Weltanschauung is not the final word of the spirit, which has passed through them all, but the sovereignty of the spirit, as opposed to each individual Weitan- schauung, and at the same time the positive consciousness that in the different attitudes of the spirit the One Reality of the world is given us." This is a highly valuable insight, which is more and more gaining control of modern philosophy. Without giving up</page><page sequence="6">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 405 metaphysics, and without regarding its method as meaningless, he does not regard metaphysical conceptions as entitled to any absolute significance. They disclose one aspect of the world, not the whole world. This view is championed also by Wundt, Eduard von Hartmann, and Volkelt, and still more posi- tively by Simmel. The essence of philosophy, which Dilthey distinguishes happily and profoundly from religion and art, is described as a manifold of problems, the common element in which is the subjugation of the dark sphere of the instincts under the dominion of the reason and the struggle toward ultimate uni- versal ideals of unity. " The fundamental attribute of philoso- phy is, therefore, the characteristic of the spirit which transcends the definite, finite, limited interest and strives to regulate every theory that originates out of a limited need by means of a more comprehensive idea." In this way Dilthey, in Kant's spirit, gives the autonomous essence of philosophy its due, Paulsen also, in his essay, Die Zukunftsaufgaben der Philoso- phie (in Kultur der Gegenwart), attempts to secure for philosophy independence in its epistemological and metaphysical aspects. In reference to ontology, Paulsen characterizes his view as ob- jective idealism; his philosophy is panpsychism. In reference to cosmology, he substitutes monistic pantheism for atomism, for the former of which support is given in the reciprocity that extends from the most minute to the greatest spatial and temporal phe- nomena. Like Hartmann and Wundt, Paulsen attempts to pro- vide a synthesis between intellectualism and voluntarism. He attempts to harmonize his metaphysics with Kant's criticism. Philosophy is not exhausted by the exact sciences, neither can it be limited to an internally consistent combination of their results. So much can be stated as the result of these discussions. All in- vestigation concerns itself with the factual; it presupposes the concept of fact. The meaning of fact, of reality, is a philosoph- ical question, that precedes all particular investigation, a question that cannot be answered by any combination of actualities. Philosophical epistemology contains the principles of ontology and has a right to the title of 'First Philosophy.' Before one investigates the content of being, one must first clarify the con-</page><page sequence="7">406 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. cept of being. Before one investigates nature, one must first clarify the notion of nature. And so the study of psychology demands a philosophical explanation, which scarcely permits of being confined to a negative determination of psychology with- out a soul (Fr. A. Lange). Only after a general exposition of this sort, which is joined to no particular knowledge, can an attempt be made to discuss philosophically the special disciplines in detail: physics, biol- ogy, history, characterology, sociology. Ethics, aesthetics, and the philosophy of religion share with general epistemology and ontology the rank of ' First Philosophy,' having to do with norms and values, and they are, therefore, not derivable from the realm of facts. In the third place, one may conceive of a phi- losophy that undertakes the encyclopedic task of a consistent penetration, combination, and unification of the entire realm of knowledge. - The various definitions of philosophy do not mu- tually exclude each other; in fact, its concept, as history insist- ently teaches us, cannot be strictly unitary. From the foregoing it is clear that the attitude of these various thinkers toward the problem of philosophy is mirrored in their conceptions of logic, ethics, and aesthetics. Logic is discussed by Windelband in Philosophie im Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahr- hunderts, and by Riehl in Kultur der Gegenwart. As both thinkers take their start from Kant, there is no essential opposi- tion in their views. They differ from each other only in the fact that Riehl regards algebraic logic as an important achievement, while Windelband looks upon it as a sterile game. It is espe- cially in epistemology that both philosophers stand on Kantian ground, although Windelband represents more strictly the his- torical criticism, while Riehl inclines to positivism. In the Fest- sch-ift, Ethics is treated by Bruno Bauch, and in the Kultur der Gegenwart, by Paulsen. Here the opposition between apriorism and empiricism is more marked. Bauch takes the Kantian point of view: the moral law in its inner essence is not derived from experience and has a purely formal character. Bauch distin- guishes between the dogmatism of the social, utilitarian morality, the immoral individualism of Nietzsche, and the critical ethics.</page><page sequence="8">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 407 He favors Nietzsche as against a dogmatism which aims to level individual distinctions in the interest of shallow average values, but he sees Nietzsche's profound mistake in thinking he could utilize the naturalism of the will-to-power as a basis for the read- justment of all values. As Bauch rightly observes, power is a natural phenomenon, which has nothing to do with the selection of the superior and may even decide against the stronger. The purely formal moral principle, that Bauch develops in dependence on Kant, aims to leave free play for individuality, as the content of the act and its motive are not the essential elements here. The essential element here is the universal maxim. This appears to be a reconciliation of individualism and universalism. Paulsen, on the contrary, rejects the critical foundation and endeavors to find a unifying principle in the breadth of historical experience. 'He goes back to Aristotle, because he regards the essence of morality as given in the unfolding of all human and cultural forces; he approaches a naturalistic view, in citing as criterion of the moral, those elements that promote the survival of hu- manity. He subordinates this conception to his anti-materialistic metaphysics. The world is a spiritual totality, regulated by moral ends. iEsthetics is treated in the Festschrift by Groos, in the Kultur der Gegenwart by Lipps. Groos discriminates between a tran- scendental-normative and a psychological-descriptive analysis of the problem, and ascribes a relative justification to each view. In opposition to logical normation, which lays claim to absolute value, although it is limited by the presupposition of the idea of truth, psychological formation is concerned with relative values, which may be invalidated by experience. Groos next investigates the psychical conditions of aesthetic creation and appreciation, in which the concept of Einfiublung (Sympathy') plays an essential r6le. Lipps discusses this concept minutely. He distinguishes between three kinds of Einfiihlung: general apperceptive Ein- fiuhlung, as in the reduction of a manifold to unity; natural Ein- fiuhlung, which regards external reality as a psychical thing, filled 1 Professor E. B. Titchener has suggested the introduction of the term " enpathy " as an equivalent for Einfiihlung.</page><page sequence="9">408 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. with forces and energies; temperament Einfuhlung, which re- gards the subjective feeling-character as an element of the ex- ternal world itself. Lipps furnishes, further, an interesting analysis of the arts from the standpoint of their media of repre- sentation. The philosophy of religion is discussed only in the Festschrift, in which the article is written by Troeltsch. The author discusses his subject under five rubrics: the relation of religion to philoso- phy, to theology, to epistemology, to psychology, and finally the traditional classical philosophy of religion. He distinguishes between knowledge and faith in the Kantian sense, and objects to the attempt made by Kant to introduce an abstract intellectuali- zation of specifically religious contents, as in the case of inspira- tion and revelation. He thinks the future of religion will be de- termined by a union of the ecclesiastical with a philosophically spiritualized faith. The history of philosophy is also discussed in the Festschrift. Windelband criticises its aims and problems in a spirited essay. It seems a contradiction to say that the knowledge of absolute truth has a history and a development, that this history is even essential to such knowledge, a part of philosophy itself. But the following consideration enlightens us: man cannot grasp absolute truths in their own form, but merely in the imperfect form of his personal consciousness, which only gradually comes into posses- sion of them. This explains the controversy between philo- sophical systems and the thinkability of a relative justification of opposing philosophies, as well as the significance of the history of philosophy for the essence of philosophy itself. This closes the series of writings that discuss the relation of philosophy to science. Then follows the second problem, the problem of a philosophical foundation for the special disciplines. First of all, we have the two realms, inner and outer world, psychology and philosophy of nature. Wundt and Ebbinghaus write on psychology, the former in the Festschrift, the latter in Kultur der Gegenwart. Wundt confines himself, in the main, to a historical survey, singling out for discussion the two achievements of the nineteenth century, experimental psychology and folkpsy-</page><page sequence="10">No. 4.1 GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 409 chology. Ebbinghaus analyzes first the various theories of the nature of the psychological. He rejects the theory of interaction and favors the theory of parallelism. This he explains meta- physically: the physical and psychical are merely phenomenal forms of a unitary third element. Especial attention is devoted to the explanation of the higher psychical content, faith, art, and morality, which are viewed from the standpoint of a moderate empiricism. The two philosophies of nature stand in sharp opposition to each other, that of Lipps presented in the second edition of the Festschrift and that of Ostwald in the Kultur der Gegenwart. While Ostwald, in spite of his empiristic tendency, advances a baroque metaphysics Lipps stands on the heights of the critical consciousness and from this point penetrates the entire fabric of mythological and anthropological concepts, which continue to dominate the philosophy of nature. Ostwald's reputation is based on his achievement in the special sciences, and not on his philosophical utterances, and it is there- fore questionable whether his selection for this discussion was justifiable. Ostwald clings to the set of views whose ontological significance is ruthlessly exposed by Lipps, without giving any critical account of them. His study is not lacking in interesting explanations that are to the point. But as a philosophy of nature, his theories fail to justify themselves. The objection raised by Ostwald against the apriorism of mathematics, rests chiefly on the old confusion of value and origin of knowledge, a confusion censured by Kant. And so he is unable to distinguish between the philosophy of nature and the scientific investigation of na- ture, as he regards the former as merely the combination of the experiences deposited in the latter. The brilliant fashion in which Lipps discusses the problem from a completely opposite standpoint, I shall take up later, owing to the arrangement of my report, and because of the connection of Lipps's views with those of Schelling. The philosophy of history is presented by Rickert and Eucken in a somewhat similar spirit; by the former in the Festschrift, by the latter in the Kultur der Gegenwart. Rickert's view is well</page><page sequence="11">410 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVII. known from his epoch-making work, Die Grenzen der naturwis- senschaftlichen Begriffsbildung. He shows here that a blending of history with the science of nature is not possible, because the formation of notions in the one case is an individualizing and evaluating process, while in the other case it is a generalizing process. That from the immense fullness of becoming some- thing is selected as historically significant, is in itself a proof that we make a judgment of value. What one refers to as the mean- ing of history is no natural law of development; it is an ideal norm that we attach to historical process. It presupposes belief in a supreme value of life, that we at the same time regard as the absolute end of historical evolution. Eucken also distinguishes between the meaning of history and the natural course of events. He finds, in the first place, an antinomy between the external dependence of man on temporal processes and his historical impulse to preserve the past, which can be explained only by the feeling that there are permanent values, which are untouched by temporal variations. It is the same antinomy that Windelband attempts to solve in his essay on his- tory, and he and Eucken solve it in similar ways. The spiritual life is, in and for itself, a system of eternal values; but it reveals itself to man only piece by piece, not as a whole, and this reve- lation, therefore, needs time, in which it is gradually conveyed to humanity. From this opposition between the limited, natural, empirical character of human consciousness and the eternal, ab- solute, and spiritual nature of the ideal world, arises the necessity of history, the conflict between error and truth, the variability of culture-forms in conjunction with the feeling for the permanent that springs from the essence of culture itself. In addition to this, we find in the Festschrift a discussion of the philosophy of law by Lask, and in the Kultur der Gegenwart a discussion of pedagogy by Munch. Lask aims to introduce into the philoso- phy of law the strict transcendental viewpoint in distinction from the empirical, which deduces the universal character of law from particular legal facts, and in distinction from the metaphysical viewpoint of natural rights, where the concrete, historical content of the law is supplanted by arbitrary forms of thought. This</page><page sequence="12">No. 4.1 GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 4L1 content must remain undisturbed; the aprioristic spiritual norms should serve merely for evaluation. Munch keeps the psychological and the ethical character of education distinct; he sketches the historical development of pedagogy. He refers to the various modern movements for in- ternal and external organization of instruction, and emphasizes the necessity of modifying it in terms of the constantly changing con- ditions of civilization. If we compare the two works, we find that the Philosophie im Beginn des zwanzigsten Jakrhunderts is more unitary than the Kultur der Gegenwart, which is in part explained by the fact that the essays centre about the personality of Kuno Fischer. The essays maintain, in general, the viewpoint of criticism: the clear discrimination between value and reality, ideal and actual, idea and experience, dominates the whole and its parts. On the other hand, Kultur der Gegenwart shows that combination of empiri- cism, psychologism, and metaphysics, which ordinarily manifests itself, when the principles of the transcendental philosophy are rejected. Criticism is not a finished entirety that can be converted into a dogma, but it points the way for future development. The wealth of problems contained in it and the fruitfulness of its method become visible anew every year in the philosophical literature. The Kantstudien last year published a series of articles of importance for the questions under consideration. Cassirer investigated the relations of logic to mathematics in a study entitled Kant und die moderns Mathematik, in which, in referring to Russell's and Couturat's works, he adduces proofs that Kant's foundation of mathematics is confirmed by modern theories, if we only keep one point in mind: as an epistemo- logical system it is deduced not from the tEsthetic, but from the Analytic, not from pure perception but from the Transcendental Logic. In a later number Bauch published an interesting article, Erfahrung und Geometrie in ikrem erkenntnistheoretischen Ver- khatnis. In an extraordinarily fine and subtle investigation, this thinker examined the various possibilities of a mediation between geometry and experience. The foundation of the Euclidean</page><page sequence="13">412 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. geometry on the generalization of experience is rejected because of the aprioristic character of the discipline. Its superiority to the non-Euclidean geometries of Riemann and Lobatscbewski is not to be explained on the ground that it is supplementarily confirmed by experience, for experience does not attain to the ideality of pure forms. Finally, Poincare's citation of conven- ience, as the element that explains its success, is not tenable. For convenience, according to Bauch's convincing argument, is a purely psychological mark, incapable of supporting any logical, basic truth, and therewith the much cited principle of economy is also made ineffectual. As long as one regards the various geometries from a universal, formal point of view, they are all of equal value. It is only when one regards the matter from the viewpoint of the transcendental logic, where the connection between thought and being comes into consideration, that differences arise. The Euclidean geom- etry is adequate to the confirmation of experience, somewhat in the sense that the latter is not made possible by the analytic prin- ciple of identity, but by the synthetic principle of causality. The question as to what furnishes the Euclidean geometry with this power over experience, a question which Bauch does not discuss in detail, is scarcely answerable in its entire extent; we are here concerned with an ultimate factum, not further deducible. Never- theless, the concession seems to be made to experience here that in its universal character it needs the specific idealization offered in our geometry. Inasmuch as we mean by apriorism not any innate psychical faculty, but rather logical idealism, the status of apriorism is not affected. The Euclidean geometry is related to our empirical space analogously to the way in which causality is related to empirical succession. One cannot speak of an empiri- cal deduction, but rather of an empirical possession, of pure forms. This relation of the Transcendental iEsthetic and Logic to experience I have attempted to clarify in another article of the Kantstudien of last year, Die Grenzen des Empirismus und des Rationalismus in Kant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft. A notable article by Medicus on Kant und die gegenwiirtige Aufgabe der Logik will be referred to later. There have also been published</page><page sequence="14">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 413 several supplementary numbers of the Kantstudien containing interesting monographs: Die Religionsphilosophie Tiefirunks, by Gustav Hertz; and Kant's Stil in der Kritik der reinen Vernunft, by Ernst Fischer. The suggestiveness of the Kantian philosophy is inexhaustible. One welcomes, therefore, all the more warmly the undertaking of the Berlin Academy of Sciences to collect Kant's works in a com- plete, critical edition, of which Volumes VI and VII were pub- lished in the past year. Stumpf remarked in his rectoral address that the philosophy of the future would have to discover a synthesis of Kant and Leib- niz; Cassirer's monumental work, Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophic und Wissenschaft der neueren Zeit, points to the same view. It was not in vain that Cassirer in an earlier treatise worked out a thorough exposition of the Leibnizian system. His Erkenntnisproblemn, the second volume of which appeared last year, shows the dominant position occupied by Leibniz and the profound influence it had on Kant's thought, an influence which was formerly underestimated in favor of the English em- piricists. The second volume contains the fourth book, Fortbil- dung und Vollendung des Rationalismus (Spinoza and Leibniz); fifth book, Das Erkenntnisproblem im System des Empirismus (Bacon, Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume); sixth book, Von Newton zu Kant; seventh book, Die kritische Philosophie. In the last book Cassirer discusses especially the relation of tran- scendentalism to pure perception. Hermann Cohen, by whom Cassirer is profoundly influenced, has published in the past year a Kommentar zu Kant's Kritik der reinen 1/ernunft, in which he aims to furnish a concise, unitary exposition of Kant's fundamental ideas in accompaniment with the text.' The volume is a supplement to Cohen's larger works on Kant. In this connection I shall refer to my treatise published last year, Kant's kritischer Idealismus als Grundlage von Erkenntnis- theorie und Etkik.2 This treatise, the outlines of which appeared IPhilosophische Bibliothek, Bd. I 13, DUrr, Leipzig. 2 Ernst Hofmann, Berlin, 1907.</page><page sequence="15">414 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, [VOL. XVII. in i906 in my monograph, Kants Methodologie in liren Grund- zuigen, also examines the relations between perception and thought, mathematics and logic. The refutation of subjective idealism, which derives the forms of perception from the subject, constitutes the first part of the discussion. The second part is concerned with the fundamental principles of transcendental idealism. The forms of perception are not created by the sub- ject, but are immediately given as the contents of perception. The categories are in no sense perceptual forms, but the forms of ideal knowledge. There is no pure perception of space and time, but only empirical perception of the same. Pure perception is an idea of limitation; it designates the fundamental principle of man- ifoldness in opposition to the principle of unity and identity, that issues from the pure understanding. Mathematics arises from the union of formal logic with the principle of manifoldness, dy- namics from the union with empirical perception. The refutation of subjective idealism concludes with an attempt at a realistic metaphysics. In so far as the exponents of modern philosophy are not advo- cates of positivism, psychologism, or empiricism, they are found for the most part in the camp of Kantianism. Thinkers also like Rickert and Windelband, who advocate a specifically episte- mological neo-Fichteanism, by forming the concept of an over- individual consciousness, consciousness in general, as an inventory of timeless, logical values, and by furnishing a unitary deduction of all the categories from a supreme epistemological end, remain within the periphery of Kantian criticism, for they do not accept the essential feature, Fichte's metaphysic. Along with them we find a series of men who are more closely associated with the post-Kantian idealists, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. This circle widened last year. Medicus holds fast to Fichte. Mention was made of his book on Fichte in my last report. His article on Kant und die gegenwiirtige Aufgabe der Logik, published at an earlier date in the Kanistudien, takes the same position, although in a characteristic way it reveals many echoes of Hegel. "Criticism carried out," says Medicus, " is Dialectic." Neither Kant's nor Fichte's system is complete on all sides.</page><page sequence="16">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 415 Both find their orientation chiefly in mind; their relation to nature is not clearly determined. Schelling and Hegel undertook to establish a stable equilibrium by conceptually mastering external nature in the fullness of its forms. Above all, Schelling is to be characterized as the founder of the philosophy of nature. In my last report I said that Lipps, judged by his most recent philosophical writings, held a view closely akin to Schelling's philosophy, and I was then able with certain reservations to cite his Stuttgart address. My statement has received extraordi- narily clear confirmation in Lipps's Naturphilosophie, incorporated anew in the second edition of the Philosophie im Beginn des zwanzigstenJahrhunderts. This essay is to be reckoned amongst the most interesting and brilliant philosophical achievements of late years. From the starting point of a broad empiricism, he takes a bold flight into metaphysical regions, such as has prob- ably not been undertaken since the days of Hegel. Whatever one's viewpoint may be, one cannot deny the excellences of Lipps's exposition, his cogent logic and the world-feeling issuing from the depths of personality. His leading idea is that nature is comprehensible only by postulating as its substrate a divine all-consciousness. The essay is so important that I must note its course of thought in a few lines. The philosophy of nature cannot be a criticism of facts; that is the business of the special sciences. The philosophy of nature is simply the answer to the question as to structure or meaning of the knowledge of nature in general. Natural law is no pure de- scription of phenomena; it is rather an analysis of natural process into its ideal component elements. Further, it must reduce every material content to form-relations. These relations are primarily of a spatial character. Space is neither an empty receptacle nor the sum of varied spatial determinations, but an internal unity of phenomena. This unity dominates individual things and proc- esses, so that they can be conceived only as parts, as modi of the absolute, all-comprehending substance. The following explana- tions of force, energy, and work mark the critical zenith of the essay, where Lipps discloses the naive anthropomorphism of these concepts. " Nothing persists, as when one says ' energy persists,'</page><page sequence="17">4i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. but possibilities persist, and these occur only in the thinking mind." The feeling of energy is experienced immediately in our psychi- cal life. It is, therefore, meaningless to speak of an energistic theory of nature. Cosmology develops in three distinct stages. Natural science transcends the naive stage, in finding reality not in our sensations, but in space and time relations. This second stage is supplanted by the philosophy of nature. For in space, which becomes meaningless with the elimination of per- ception, we have a contradiction. The spatial view of the world necessitates the postulation of isolated atoms as the substrate of natural process, but the unity of the world-process demands fusion into an absolute, all-comprehending substance as the sub- strate of becoming. From this interesting antinomy, whose originality and importance must be emphasized, Lipps concludes there is no independent reality of space. The philosopher of na- ture rejects everything that the naive consciousness had acknowl- edged as reality. There remains as the thing-in-itself only an x, an unknown stripped of every determination. If one aims to determine this as an immediately given, one can do so only after the analogy of human consciousness, the only immediately given, immediately experienced. Our consciousness is no spatial thing nor any sensible quality. Nevertheless, it is a real, existing in and for itself, not mere phenomenon like the external world. Here Lipps takes issue with the famous assertion of Kant that the psychical is only phenomenon. The brain-processes are merely symbols of the events of consciousness. One cannot call the brain the cause of consciousness, because consciousness is an inner unity, whereas the brain is spatial, and space, as inti- mated in the foregoing analysis, presents no definitive unity. This treatment of psychophysics is original and remarkable in the highest degree. In reality, individual consciousness is not at- tached to the brain, but rather to the reason, which furnishes it with the complete laws of thought. This reason is an over- individual world-ego, that creates the world. In this Lipps goes far beyond the neo-Fichteanism of Rickert and Windelband, for they assign to universal consciousness merely the character of a logical abstraction, whereas Lipps makes of it the highest meta-</page><page sequence="18">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 4I7 physical reality. Lipps thus renews monadology in its logical and moral aspect: every individual ego mirrors in his way the world-ego. " Here the end postulated for the individual is that he mirror in his consciousness and its conditions the world-ego, i. e., in his place become like the world-ego." The identity be- tween nature and spirit postulated by Lipps is a feature of Schelling's philosophy. Thinkers will not all agree with his bold conclusions. But all must agree that Lipps has brilliantly laid bare the anthropomorphisms of a science of nature ignorant of its limits and has banished them from its territory, in order to prepare the way for an idealistic philosophy. Eduard von Hartmann's school stands still nearer Schelling's position. Its founder was at one with Schelling in seeking a mediating principle between the dynamism of nature and the log- ical character of mind, and this principle he thought he had dis- covered in the Unconscious. Hartmann's philosophy will be made accessible in a comprehensive edition of his works, planned for eight volumes, of which the first two volumes, Epistemology and Psychology, have been published.' One may expect that the concept of the Unconscious will be made entirely clear by this publication. Amongst the followers of Hartmann, Arthur Drews has be- come prominent as a defender of the master. His book entitled Plotin und der Untergang der antigen Weltanschauung (published by Diederichs, 1907) shows this bias. Similary, his co-partisan Leopold Ziegler, in his volume Der abendlindische Rationalismus und der Eros, sees in Plotinus the zenith of ancient thought. Plotinus prepares the way, at least, for the solution of the relation between nature and spirit, a problem which ancient philosophy was unable to solve. Plotinus was the first to grasp the idea that nature is not deducible from spirit nor spirit from nature, but that both are phenomenal modes of an Absolute, and the Uncon- scious gives the key for the search for the Absolute. In an interesting work, Per Monismus (first volume), published by Diederichs under the editorship of Drews, and containing a series of philosophical essays by various writers, similar views are I Published by Haacke, Bad Sachsa im Harz.</page><page sequence="19">418 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. conspicuous. Arthur Drews, in the first essay, describes the dif- ferent types of monism, and, by eliminating the false forms, which convert the world-unity either materialistically into nature or spiritualistically into mind, he attempts to establish a true monism in the doctrine of the Unconscious, comprehending both nature and mind. There is doubtless a distinction between these several methods of reviving the point of view of Schelling: first of all in this, that Lipps identifies the Absolute with the world-consciousness, while the school of Hartmann finds it in the Unconscious. One must, however, take into account that the world-consciousness is not to be conceived after the analogy of personal consciousness, and that Hartmann's Unconscious is not to be conceived after the analogy of Schopenhauer's blind will, but rather as an Unconscious filled with rational ideas. The Unconscious is a negative concept, by which one may characterize the All-conscious in so far as this is in principle a different type of consciousness, irreducible to the conditions of individual consciousness. In this way the two points of view may be fairly described in their metaphysical bear- ings. Both may be referred to Schelling, as in his philosophy there are no clear determinations on this point. The motives that led to the transcending of Kant and the re- vival of Fichte and Schelling, led also to the revival of Hegel. The metaphysical and monistic impulse finds support in his doctrine. This is especially true of the purely logical impulse. While Kant's concept of knowledge remained always anthropo- logical, in so far as it was determined by human organization (note the opposition between the discursive thought of man and the hypothesis of an intuitive divine understanding), Hegel de- livers reason entirely from all reference to anything else, lets it revolve exclusively on it own axis. Conceptual thought has its centre of gravity in itself; it is no longer relative, whether in reference to the content that is thought or in reference to the thinking mind, but an Absolute, whose products are eternal, au- tonomous verities. This conception is completely identical with the theory of pure logic in vogue to-day. And so we have new points of connection with Hegel, whether or not one retains his</page><page sequence="20">No. 4.1 GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 4I9 general principle of logical purism or even his method of dialectic. An external proof of this is the publication of two jubilee editions of Hegel's Phaenomnenologie, his first fundamental work. In addi- tion to the Dutch edition of Professor Bolland (publ. by A. H. Adriani, Leyden), mentioned in my last report, a German edition has been prepared by Georg Lasson (publ. by Diirr, Leipzig), son of the well-known Hegelian, Adolf Lasson, which is charac- terized by great perspicuity. In my last report, I pointed out the fact that the wealth of Kantian motives developed in the movement from Fichte to Hegel had not been exhausted. If we omit Schopenhauer and Herbart, there is still Fries, whose significance must not be overlooked. He furnishes a supplementation rather than an opposition to the first named thinkers. While these attempt to establish a system of objective epistemological values, Fries, without attacking the objectivity of knowledge in the meaning of psychologist, turns his attention to the conditions under which these values are real- ized. He takes psychology and not logic as the starting-point in his endeavors to overthrow psychologist, by seeking to dis- cover in empirical consciousness itself the values that possess a significance higher than the empirical. Elsenhans, privat-docent at the University of Heidelberg, has attempted to set this view in its proper light in his book, Fries und Kant ein Beitrag zur Ge- schiiclte und zur systematischen Grundlegung der Erkenntnis- theorie, the second volume of which appeared in 1907.1 The Fries School in G6ttingen, founded by Leonard Nelson, has also taken this position. The first two numbers of the second volume of the Abhandlungen der Fries'schen Schule (Vanden- hoeck und Ruprecht, I907) contain three noteworthy articles in defense of the new method: a reply by Nelson to the objections of Paul Stern published in the Philosophische Wochenschkrft under the title Inhalt und Gegenstand, Grund und Begriindung; two replies to Ernst Cassirer's objections in the article, LDer kritische Idealismus und die Philosophie des gesunden Menschenverstandes, published in Cohen und Natorp's Pizilosophische Arbeiten. Of these two replies, the first is entitled Kritik und System in Mathe- 1 Published by To5pelmann, Giessen.</page><page sequence="21">420 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. matik und Philosophie, by Hessenberg; the second, Anthropolo- gische Vernunftkritik, by Grelling. The controversy between the two groups, the stricter Kantians and the followers of the Fries School, is carried on with great vehemence, but not with entire clearness. Although Cassirer is right in his warning against the reference of the epistemological values of criticism to the sound human understanding, Nelson and his followers are also right in their claim that the ultimate ground of epistemological values is a factum, namely, the immediacy of rational knowledge. One can validate the claims of the supreme logical truths in no other way than by showing that they are a factual possession of the rational spirit. They are not thereby reduced to the level of empirical facts. The pure logician, who establishes his position on all sides, arrives consistently at psychology and phenome- nology, for he must prove how ideals are realized psychically, and just in this realization how they differ from empirical and variable psychical phenomena. That is the path that leads from Kant to Fries. On the other hand, the psychologist must discover within his realm relations that point beyond immediate psychical content, that mean more than they are in their sensible phenom- enal form, and this applies to the logical laws of the formation of the concept, the function of judgment, and inference. They are distinguishable from empirical feelings and ideas by the fact that their meaning is not exhausted in their process of coming and going; they are directed towards an over-individual, timeless principle of ideal unity, that finds in the content of the idea, properly speaking, only a symbol and representation. In this way the psychologist, who starts from the presupposition that everything may somehow be represented as psychical phenom- enon, arrives at a peculiar class of phenomena, the logical, reli- gious, ethical, and esthetic values, and thereby surmounts psy- chologism. This is the path followed by several thinkers, and characteristically for the most part by those thinkers whose starting-point was the extreme psychological position of Brentano: Husserl, Meinong, and Stumpf. Stumpf, whose rectoral address was mentioned earlier in this report, by discriminating between empirical and ideal values, is led to a sharp separation of phe-</page><page sequence="22">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 421 nomenon from function (a view developed in his treatise, Erschei- nungen und psychische Functionen) chiefly in reference to logical content. He further justifies this distinction in an important and interesting article, Zur Einteilung der Wissenschaften. Here he combines the traditional division of the subject-matter of knowl- edge into the science of nature and science of mind with the recent classification advanced by Rickert and Windelband, viz., natural and historical science. The problem of philosophy is here described in terms similar to those of the rectoral address. This is the direction taken last year in the treatment of the epistemological problem. Although the way had been already indicated, still there can be no doubt that the investigation has been enriched by new factors. We see again how Kant main- tains his position as the focal point in philosophical thought. The delimitation of the transcendental from metaphysical and psychological inquiry, ideal value from empirical reality, ought from being, from transcendent as well as immanent being, has continued dominant. In one respect the tendency to supersede Kant is noticeable, viz., in reference to metaphysics. Positivism and phenomenalism, represented most prominently by Mach and Avenarius, are losing ground. And so at the present moment the metaphysical motives in Kant are more emphasized than the extreme idealistic elements. We have noticed in the most diverse movements, most clearly in the case of Lipps, the recurring dis- position to postulate as metaphysical ground of all phenomena an absolute principle, a principle unifying nature and spirit. Many signs point to philosophy's becoming again a spiritual power in German civilization. Even the masses, dissatisfied with tradition, are struggling towards a new world-view. We also find a widespread tendency amongst special investigators to treat their field as a branch of philosophy. The influence of Haeckel and the success of the ' monistic guild' are proofs of this. At present this movement has lost in intensity, because in opposi- tion to its materialistic character, spiritualistic and idealistic motives have gained ascendency in the popular mind. This activity is variously expressed, as in the increased reading of the classical philosophers and their interpreters, in the publication of</page><page sequence="23">422 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVII. encyclopedic collective works and chrestomathies, such as Koh- ler's 1 and Menzer and Dessoir's, in the popular regard for such artists and thinkers as Nietzsche, Tolstoi, and Maeterlinck, in the strong current of neo-romanticism, and in the revival of the relig- ious spirit, leading to the deepening of the problems of the philosophy of religion, as well as to mysticism and theosophism. Interest is still concentrated on Nietzsche's philosophy. One seeks to master the confusing wealth of his world of ideas by dis- covering definite points of relationship between him and other thinkers. His relationship to contemporary thought is discussed by Vaihinger's book, Nietzsche ats Philosoph, his relation to Schopenhauer and Kant by Simmel's work, Schopenhauer und Nietzsche. We are now clear that Nietzsche was no nihilist, nor immoralist in the ordinary meaning of the word; he aimed to create new moral values. I had taken this view earlier in my book, Nietzsches Lehre in seinen Grundbegriffen. Nietzsche's relation to Wagner is treated broadly rather than deeply by Belart in the work, Friedrich Nietzsche und Richard Wagner (Wunder, Berlin, I907). Although the idea of the suprahuman is common to Nietzsche, Kant, and Wagner, the point that distinguishes Nietzsche from the latter two is the fact that he does not look for the overman in the sphere of universality, in the religious or aesthetic universe, but rather in the sphere of individuation. It was this intensive nuance of individualism that appeared to point from Nietzsche to Max Stirner, the author of the remarkable work Der Einzige und sein Eigentum. Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as expo- nents of essentially the same philosophy. This view is approxi- mated by Max Messer in his monograph Max Stirner,2 who sees Stirner's greatness in the fact that he was the first to show the illusory character of impersonal ideals and to recognize nothing as value that cannot justify its title to personal value. Messer is right in his contention that true idealism cannot suffer by this but 1 Published by Enke, Stuttgart, I907.

He refers the apparently immoral- istic character of Stirner to his attempt to set up an iron opposi- tion to the abstract moral dogma of the past. In general he regards Stirner's work as an immense advance over Hegel's attempt to convert individual reality into a fabric of abstractions. Little as one may contest the importance of Stirner, who was an energetic rather than profound thinker, still one has good cause to be cautious in comparing him with Nietzsche. Individualism is Stirner's last word, but not Nietzsche's. Nietzsche's phi- losophy as a whole is not egocentric. He finds the ego spun into the world, into the great complex play, which man must fashion and live from its innermost centre, without clinging to any singular reality, not even to the reality of his own person, for the wealth of being would thus be lessened. He shall take the world with all its contradictions, without attempting to over- throw them dogmatically. There is in this philosophy an ele- ment that recalls the notion of ' romantic irony,' without being at all identical with it. And so it is explicable that Nietzsche's profoundest influence, in spite of his outward opposition to every type of mysticism, and in spite of the apparently naturalistic char- acter of his doctrine, is closely allied to mystic motives. For it is the essence of the romantic philosophy that culminated in Schelling and Novalis to regard the focal point of reality as given not in the single individual but in a higher universal prin- ciple. It is significant that an ingenious thinker, Count Hermann Keyserling, who in his first work Das Gefiige der Welt revealed his kinship with neo-romanticism, raises objection to Stirner's individualism in his recent publication Unsterblichkeit.1 The im- mortal element in man, to which his innermost will-to-survive is turned, is not his person, but rather an impersonal, ideal, cosmic element. Keyserling tries to support this thesis in an interesting but in no way cogent exposition, of a psychological and episte- mological character. On the other hand, Ernst Horneffer is decidedly wrong when he fancies in his work, Wege zum Leben,2 that he is a follower of 'Lehmann, Munchen, 1907. 'Klinkhardt, Leipzig, 1907.</page><page sequence="25">424 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. Nietzsche. For his values are extreme, individualistic values, ap- proximating the philosophy of Stirner. The aim of human life is not surrender to a universal, as to God or the universe, but unceasing shaping, separation, and individuation. Saitschik's position is much nearer that of neo-romanticism. In his discriminating work, Quid est veritas,l which is written in the form of dialogue, he endeavors to discover a harmonious union of individualistic and universalistic points of view, and combats the positivistic fallacy that the meaning of the world is exhausted in a complex of natural laws. Neo-romanticism continues to flourish. The arts are influenced by it, especially music, which Richard Wagner, the last and per- haps the greatest romanticist, conducted into this realm. We have observed that philosophical theories also continue to show the marks that may be traced back to Schelling's and Novalis's "moonlit magic night." This explains the historical interest in the creations and culture of the romantic period. Connected with this is last year's discussion of Herder's philosophy. Herder's und Kant's Aesthetik is an instructive book by Jacoby.2 Carl Siegel, privatdocent in the University of Vienna, has written a work entitled Herder als p/jilosoph,3 covering the whole of Herder's philosophy in a clear and convenient way. Both of these writers regard Herder as the forerunner of post-Kantian idealism, and Siegel even characterizes him as the thinker who sowed the fruitful seeds of Schelling's philosophy of nature. Herder's relation to romanticism is, of course, too apparent to permit of question. Still more important is the new edition of Schelling's selected works in three volumes (published by Eck- hardt, Leipzig), edited by Otto Weiss, to which Arthur Drews has added a preface. "The repetition," so he writes, "which contemporary philosophy is passing through, forces it from the transcendentalism of Kant to the subjective idealism of Fichte, and from the latter to the absolute idealism of Hegel. Here, however, Schelling's idealism demands consideration as a middle ,Ernst Hohmann &amp; Co., Berlin, 1907. 2 DUrr, Leipzig, 1907. 3Cotta, Stuttgart, 1907.</page><page sequence="26">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1907. 425 stage and mediating member." In Drew's work Schelling, as well as Plotinus, appears in the role of discoverer of the Uncon- scious, and also as the philosopher who, in his final "positive philosophy," freed himself from the illusion of rationalism, that resolves the world unceasingly into thought, in order to set in its place an empiristic metaphysics. The centre of neo-romanticism is the Jena publishing house of Eugen Diederichs, whose eminent services were mentioned in my last report. Amongst the new publications, the edition of the works of Novalis, in four volumes, prepared by Minor, de- serves especial mention. It includes a number of interesting prefaces by Tieck. The second and third volumes contain the philosophical sketches, which although not systematically carried out, are full of profound and excellent ideas. Further, I may mention selections from Wilhelm Humboldt's Universitdt, pre- pared by Schubert, also the fine almanach Jena und Weimar, which contains a series of interesting essays by early and recent writers, referring especially to Schiller and Goethe. Indication of the revival of religious feeling is furnished espe- cially by the new journal, Religion und Geisteskulturl which con- tains important contributions from Eucken, Achelis, H6ffding and others. Without being dogmatic, this journal stands for oppo- sition to extreme rationalism, which tends to become fixed in the depths of religion. The conviction gains ground that knowledge and faith are two spheres, which in no point disturb each other, because they rep- resent two fundamentally different aspects of the universe. This conviction finds expression in the three lectures that Eucken has published under the title Hauptprobleme der Religionspkilosophie der Gegenwart.2 Religion is here conceived as a mode, in which the spiritual life communicates itself to the human individual and to nature. The spiritual life, whose discovery and knowledge is the object of most of Eucken's books, especially of his recent work, Grundlinien einer neuen Lebensanschauung, is the totality of the eternal values. These values are regarded by Eucken, as 1Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, Gottingen. ' Published by Reuther und Reichard, Berlin, 1907.</page><page sequence="27">426 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. by Schelling and Hegel, as metaphysical realities. Nature and spirit should not remain in irreconcilable variance, but spirit should make itself mistress of nature, in order to fill it in all the depths of its being. Eucken here makes himself the heir of the philosophy of identity, the heir of Schelling and Hegel, who saw in the unity of nature and spirit the goal of all philosophy and civilization. And here also all the currents of contemporary philosophy flow together; that ideal world of values to which neo-Kantianism is directed and to which, as we have seen, the efforts of the School of Fries and Brentano are directed, ex- periences in the neo-romanticism centering in Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Novalis and in the recent philosophy of religion, only an elevation to metaphysical reality. Herewith the path to the future is indicated. The return to Kant signifies a step forward against empiricism, evolutionism, psychologist, and relativism, which have domesticated them- selves in investigation. There are timeless, eternal values of knowledge, art, religion, and ethics. But the development goes further: While Kant vacillated between transcendence and im- manence, it is the tendency of the most recent philosophy (this is especially the meaning of neo-romanticism) to refer these eter- nal values in one way or another to metaphysical reality. But even here the critical spirit preserves us from dogmatic one- sidedness. I have shown that it is more and more the tendency of the most diverse thinkers to regard the world as a fullness, exhibiting contradictions and antinomies only in the human spirit. In this way one-sided logicism is overthrown. Logic, morality, art, and religion enjoy in their own realms complete sovereignty and cannot be reduced by psychological or empiristic attempts to anything merely relative or temporal. This sphere, however, is not the whole, but only a part of inexhaustible reality. OSCAR EWALD. VIENNA.</page></plain_text>
