The Specimen Dealer: Entrepreneurial Natural History in America's Gilded Age MARK V. BARROW, JR. Department of History (0117) Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg, VA 24061, U.S.A. E-mail: barrow@vt.edu Abstract. The post-Civil War American natural history craze spawned a new institution - the natural history dealer - that has failed to receive the historical attention it deserves. The indi- viduals who created these enterprises simultaneously helped to promote and hoped to profit from the burgeoning interest in both scientific and popular specimen collecting. At a time when other employment and educational prospects in natural history were severely limited, hundreds of dealers across the nation provided encouragement, specimens, publication outlets, training opportunities, and jobs for naturalists of all motivations and levels of expertise. This paper explores the crucial role that specimen dealers played in the larger natural history community. After briefly examining the development of local taxidermy shops in the mid-nineteenth century, it then traces the history of four large natural history dealerships established in the United States during the latter half of the century: Ward's Natural History Establishment, Frank Blake Webster's Naturalists' Supply Depot, Southwick &amp; Jencks' Natural History Store, and Frank H. Lattin &amp; Co. By the early twentieth century, changing tastes in interior design, the growth of the Audubon movement, and the dramatic expansion of alternate training and job opportunities for naturalists led many specimen dealers either to shift their emphasis or to shut their doors.

Historians have gathered much evidence to demonstrate the burgeoning popular interest in locating, identifying, preserving, collecting, exchanging, and displaying various natural objects.' Scientific societies, which more often than not focused on natural history, sprouted across the post-Civil War American landscape like 1 See, for example, Keeney, 1992; Sorensen, 1995; and Barrow, 1998.

Between 1860 and 1900 the population of the United States more than doubled, the gross national product quadrupled, and the total number of individuals living in urban areas increased more than five times. A vast, newly constructed rail system helped create the first truly national markets, while revolutions in the publishing industry combined with reforms in the postal service to decrease the cost and increase the availability of printed materials of all sorts.6 The wide diffusion of romanticism, once the province of a highly educated cultural elite, provided an intellectual framework both for critiquing the new urban-industrial order as well as for appreciating the aesthetic and spiritual values associated with wild nature and the outdoors.7 nineteenth-century interest in natural history into broader geographical and historical context.

I I Yet, the prolific growth of interest in natural history did not immediately translate into the kinds of career trajectories for naturalists that historians of science have traditionally stressed: in museums, government agencies and newly emerging universities. At least in the short run, the growth of popular interest in natural history outran the ability of existing institutions to absorb all of those who hoped to pursue a career in the field. This dilemma is reflected in the advice that Robert Ridgway, curator of ornithology at the U.S. National Museum, dispensed in 1887. Ridgway could offer precious little comfort to an anxious mother from California whose twenty-year-old son wanted to become a professional naturalist: I would say that if one is without the means of living independently of the study of natural history (in any of its branches), he stands a very poor chance indeed of deriving the greatest benefit from such study. It is very necessary, in fact, to have some regular business, profession, or other occupation which shall supply the means of defraying one's expenses. The study of natural history affords to those whose tastes run in that direction a very agreeable and instructive recreation, and the means of employing pleasantly and profitably hours of enforced idleness which might otherwise be passed in far more harmful ways. As a means of livelihood, however, it must, in at least ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, 8 Rodgers, 1978; Blumin, 1989. 9 On the alleged benefits of collecting natural history specimens, see Keeney, 1992, pp. 38-111; Mitchell, 1904; Jackson, 1894; Keep, 1888; Keep, 1890; and Anonymous, 1890.

BARROW, JR. prove a complete failure, success being... a question not of only of exceptional ability, but also of exceptional circumstances.12 Faced with a lack of opportunity to pursue natural history as a voca- tion, many aspiring naturalists resorted to various entrepreneurial activities to gain financial support for their activities. Historians have long recognized the extent to which eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American naturalists sought to establish new institutions and cultivate various forms of patronage to support their scientific endeavors. For example, the artist-naturalist Charles Willson Peale's ongoing efforts to wrest a living from the gate receipts at his pioneering Philadelphia Museum, established in 1796, have attracted much attention.13 Alexander Wilson's exhaustive campaign to find subscribers for his lavishly illustrated book, American Ornithology (9 vols., 1808-1814), and John James Audubon's similar efforts on behalf of his own grand publication, Birds of America (4 vols., 1827-1828), are legendary, but they are hardly unique. 14 Like many other naturalists before and since, Wilson and Audubon traveled far and wide with samples of their work to secure the financial support needed so that their ambitious, multi-volume projects could see the light of day. The activities of Louis Agassiz and Spencer F. Baird, two of the most successful entrepreneurial naturalists from the mid-nineteenth century, have also been subjected to much historical scrutiny. Agassiz, founder of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, organized a vast corres- pondence network to provide him with specimens to fill his museum and customers to purchase his expensive publications.15 Similarly, Baird, founder of the U.S. National Museum, nurtured an expansive network of sportsmen, Army surgeons, avocational naturalists, travelers, and others whose constant stream of specimen donations kept his museum pushing at the seams.16 And historians have begun reconstructing the multi-faceted links between natural history and imperialism, especially in Europe. They have shown, for example, how individual naturalists, like Joseph Banks, and natural history institutions, like Kew Gardens in England and the Societe zoologique d'acclimatation 12 Robert Ridgway to Anne Taylor, June 26, 1887, Division of Birds Records, RU 105, Box 1, Volume 3, pp. 406-407, Smithsonian Institution Archives (hereafter cited as SIA), Washington, D.C. 13 See, Appel, 1980; Scholfield, 1989; Brigham, 1995; and Sellers, 1980. 14 See, Porter, 1986; Hunter, 1983; Fries, 1973; Welch, 1998; and Blum, 1993.

Viewed from the perspective of an era that witnessed the apotheosis of economic indi- vidualism, the growth of the consumer culture, and the symbolic and literal "incorporation of America," the natural history dealership seems but one small manifestation of a much larger, more fundamental postwar transformn- ation in American society.'9 But for many individuals who either could not otherwise find employment in natural history or who were unable to support themselves on the often paltry salaries offered at other scientific institutions, the sale of specimens represented an important source of income. Besides offering employment opportunities, dealers also provided critical encourage- ment to young collectors, training opportunities in natural history, valuable publication outlets, and a steady supply of specimens that helped fuel the museum movement in the second half of the nineteenth century. And at a time when natural history was firmly focused on collecting and formal certifica- tion procedures for naturalists were minimal or nonexistent, the boundaries between commercial and scientific naturalists were quite fluid.20 Historians of science have already begun to appreciate how commercial activities played an important role in the scientific careers of the British natur- alists Henry W. Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, both of whom supported themselves through the sale of exotic specimens before making more theor- etical contributions to evolutionary theory.21 Bates and Wallace, however, 17 See, for example, Dunlap, 1999; Browne, 1996; Brockway, 1979; Gascoigne, 1998; and Osborne, 1994. On the cultural links between natural history and imperialism, see Ritvo, 1987, especially pp. 205-242. Pauly, 1996, provides a fascinating look at debates surrounding the importation of non-native flora and fauna into the United States. 18 The single major exception is Kohlstedt, 1980. Commercial activities also receive a brief mention in Mearns and Mearns, 1998. Dealers that supplied zoos and circuses with live animals have received scholarly attention in Flint, 1996. 19 Trachtenberg, 1982, is among the best interpretive histories of the economic, social, and cultural transformations during this period. 20 On the complex social dynamics of the ornithological community (a subset of the larger natural history community) in the second half of the nineteenth century, see Barrow, 1998. 21 See, Camerini, 1996; George, 1980; and O'Hara, 1995.</page><page sequence="6">498 MARK V. BARROW, JR. are only the most familiar illustrations of a phenomenon that was pervasive throughout the United States and Europe. During the second half of the nineteenth century, naturalists on both sides of the Atlantic often engaged in various commercial enterprises to support themselves.22 For some natural history enthusiasts the sale of specimens provided a temporary source of ready cash. For example, the ornithologist and mammalogist J. A. Allen financed his first semester at the Museum of Comparative Zoology through the sale of his youthful collection of mounted birds, while the fictional Elnora Comstock, the protagonist in Gene Stratton Porter's 1909 novel, A Girl of the Limberlost, sold moths and Native American relics to pay for her secondary school and college education.23 For other naturalists, however, specimen sales became a longer-term prospect, a way they might make a reasonable living in a field that fascinated them and yet that offered limited employment prospects. Taxidermy Shops Local taxidermy shops were one early prototype for the more expansive natural history dealerships that emerged in the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century. These institutions have their ultimate origins in the discovery of reliable methods of preserving bird and mammal skins at the turn of the eighteenth century.24 Before then naturalists had long known how to tan skins and thus protect them from decay, but not how to spare them from the ravages of insects. According to Paul Farber, by 1830 arsenic had become widely adopted as "the standard preservative against insect attacks."25 The development of effective techniques to thwart insect infestations made the existence of large, stable avian and mammal collections 22 Natural history dealerships seem to have begun developing much earlier in Europe, though these institutions are beyond the scope of this paper. See the brief discussion of European specimen dealers in Meams and Mearns, 1992, pp. 95-101; and in passing in Dance, 1986. Chalmers-Hunt, 1976, and Frost, 1987, provide other views of European dealers. 23 See, Allen, 1916; and Barrow, 1995, p. 60. 24 On the development of taxidermy, especially as it relates to museum practice, see Star, 1992; Morris, 1993; Frost, 1987; and Rogers, Schmidt and Guterbier, 1989. Taxidermy was an overwhelmingly male enterprise. The one prominent exception at the end of the nineteenth century seems to have been Martha Maxwell, whose activities are documented in Benson, 1986. 25 Farber, 1977. Charles Willson Peale was among the first American naturalists to import the new taxidermy techniques from Europe. He was also among the first to begin displaying his mounted specimens with backgrounds painted to resemble the organism's natural habitat. See Wonders, 1993.</page><page sequence="7">THE SPECIMEN DEALER 499 possible for the first time, and thus proved a tremendous boost to the fields of ornithology and mammalogy both in the United States and abroad.26 Naturalists were not the only ones who wanted to preserve animal skins and mounts. Sport hunters also desired to shape their prize takes into permanent trophies with which to decorate their homes and offices with tangible evidence of their prowess. Sport hunting in Europe had long been associated with the upper classes. In the mid-nineteenth century, however, many ideals associated with hunting for sport - for example, the notion of fair chase and the belief that a hunter should possess knowledge about the life history of the intended quarry - began to spread both geographically (from Europe to the United States) and socially (from the upper to the middle classes).27 Sometimes hunters tried to mount skins themselves, with the aid of one of the many available published guides, but increasingly they relied on a growing number of commercial taxidermists, whose establishments became more commonplace with the rise of sport hunting in the middle of the century (Figure 1).28 John G. Bell (1812-1889) established one of the most famous Amer- ican taxidermy enterprises from the middle of the nineteenth century.29 While most of his business undoubtedly came from sportsmen in the region surrounding his New York City establishment, Bell was also a "friend and associate" of many well-known naturalists, including Baird, Audubon, Titian R. Peale, John Cassin, George N. Lawrence, John LeConte and others. In 1843 Bell accompanied Audubon on an expedition along the upper Missouri River, where he collected several new species of birds. One of these, Bell's vireo, was subsequently named in his honor. Six years later he headed west- ward again, this time to the newly acquired territory of California. There he found four more new species, including a new sparrow that John Cassin dubbed Amphispiza belli. But most of his long career was spent in closer proximity to his famed taxidermy shop on the corner of Broadway and Worth Street. Until his retirement in the mid-1880s, a wide array of sportsmen, collectors, and naturalists gathered there regularly to exchange stories, to pour over the latest acquisitions, and to purchase specimens. One of the many budding young naturalists who sought out Bell's shop was Theodore Roosevelt, who received taxidermy instruction there in the 1870s, before 26 See Farber, 1977; Farber, 1982; and Hoffmeister and Sterling, 1994. 27 Reiger, 1975. The links between sport hunting and ornithology remained strong throughout the nineteenth century. See Barrow, 1998, pp. 30-33. 28 One of the most famous early guides available in the United States was the American edition of Bullock, 1829. 29 As with most taxidermists and natural history dealers mentioned in this paper, biograph- ical information on Bell is scanty. See Mearns and Meams, 1992, pp. 66-70; and Chapman, 1890.</page><page sequence="8">500 MARK V. BARROW, JR.

Later in life Roosevelt described Bell as "a very interesting man, an American of the before-the-war type. He was tall, straight as an Indian, with white hair and a smooth-shaven, clear-cut face; a dignified figure, always in black frock coat."30 Naturalists also flocked to the shop of another well-known New York taxidermist from the mid-nineteenth century, John Wallace, "a stout dark- haired .. . forceful looking man, rather short in stature with a decided cockney accent."3' Eugene P. Bicknell, an ornithologist and botanist, recalled with fondness his frequent youthful visits to Wallace's shop on upper Williams Street in the 1860s and 1870s: "Thither as a youth I used often to go, hesitant of troubling this always busy man, yet impelled by expectation! Almost always there would be news of unusual local birds, for many were the speci- mens that came to that work-shop, and it even might befall, on good days, that I should be allowed to take into my hands some rarity not yet dispossessed of the fresh beauty of it natural form and plumage."32 For several months in 1871, a teenage C. Hart Merriam, who was later to head the U. S. Depart- ment of Agriculture's Bureau of the Biological Survey, spent his weekends away from school learning taxidermy with Wallace.33 Three years later the ornithologist and Lawrence Scientific School graduate W. E. D. Scott worked under Wallace for several months until he found a museum curator position at Princeton. Most other large urban areas had at least one taxidermy shop. In Phil- adelphia, for example, the establishment of John Krider (1813-1886) was opened on Second and Walnut Streets in the 1830s and for the next four decades remained a "popular resort of the local sporting fraternity."34 Krider was a taxidermist, gunsmith and "quasi-scientific sportsman," who kept as many as half a dozen journeyman taxidermists on his payroll during the busy bird migration season. Like Bell, he was in contact with many prom- inent American naturalists, including Baird, Cassin, Ridgway, Thomas Mayo Brewer, Elliott Coues, and others whose publications contain regular refer- ences to specimens he collected. His travels up and down the eastern seaboard and as far west as Denver resulted in the capture of many rarities, including a new raptor he found in Iowa in the 1870s that was dubbed "Krider's hawk." Unlike other taxidermists, however, Krider actually placed some of his field observations into print. His first book on the habits of American game birds, 30 Cutright, 1985, pp. 31-33. 31 The description is from Scott, 1904, p. 71. For several years, Wallace was a partner in the firm of Wallace and Hollingsworth, located on William Street in New York City. 32 Bicknell, 1924, p. 65. 33 Sterling, 1974, p. 14. 34 The quote is from Bums, 1933, p. 74. Additional information on Krider is found in Trotter, 1912; and Trotter, 1914.</page><page sequence="10">502 MARK V. BARROW, JR. published in 1853, was followed by a series of notes in Forest and Stream as well as a second book, Forty Years Notes of a Field Ornithologist, published in 1879. The line between taxidermy establishments and natural history dealers is far from distinct. As popular interest in natural history grew in the second half of the nineteenth century, however, some taxidermy shops began to stock shells, insects, fossils, minerals, and other natural objects in addition to the skins and mounted specimens that had long represented the bulk of their trade. In other cases, particularly enthusiastic collectors - like the physician and mineralogist A. E. Foote, the shell collector William D. Averall, the ento- mologist Herbert K. Morrison, and the fossil hunter Charles H. Stemnberg - established businesses that specialized in a particular branch of natural history.35 Regardless of whether they specialized or not, many dealers also began to reach a more national clientele, a move made possible by the creation of reliable transportation networks for shipping and receiving specimens as well as by the creation of advertising outlets in nationally circulated period- icals.36 By the end of the nineteenth century, more than a hundred specimen dealers were plying their wares to collectors across the United States.37 Ward's Natural Science Establishment Henry Augustus Ward (1834-1906; Figure 2) organized what proved to be one of the earliest, largest, most important, and most enduring of the many natural history enterprises established in the second half of the nineteenth century. More than any other single institution, Ward's Natural Science Estab- lishment of Rochester, New York, provided the specimens that helped fuel the American museum movement, the tremendous growth in natural history museums that occurred in the last three decades of the century.38 And at a time when opportunities for advanced training in natural history were severely 35 Kraus, 1958; P[ilsbury], 1928; Abbott, 1973, p. 62; Abbott, 1975, pp. 513-514; Mann, 1885; and Rogers, 1991. 36 Dealers issued many of the periodicals listed in the following bibliographies: Bums, 1915; Underwood, 1954; and Fox, 1908. 37 The list in Barrow, 1992, pp. 579-590, contains the names of more than a hundred natural history dealers, most of whom were located either through a systematic examination of the various editions of the Naturalist Directory or of periodicals aimed at oologists and ornitholo- gists. The total number of natural history dealers in the United States was undoubtedly higher than this. 38 The history of Ward and his enterprise that follows is largely drawn from Kohlstedt, 1980; and Ward, 1948. See also Homaday, 1896; news of the establishment regularly appearing in the first series of Ward's Natural Science Bulletin (1881-1886); and Anonymous, 1892.</page><page sequence="11">THE SPECIMEN DEALER 503 Figure 2.

Ward was born in Rochester, New York, to a prominent family that made a fortune in mercantile pursuits, insurance sales, and land speculation as the bustling city had expanded in the mid-nineteenth century. His mother was a deeply religious woman who hoped her son would enter the ministry; his father was a restless spirit who preferred reading books to surveying and farming. Family finances were firmly under the control of his grandfather and then his grandfather's oldest son, Ward's uncle. At about age ten, young Ward began to develop an interest in rock collecting. Seven years later he enrolled</page><page sequence="12">504 MARK V. BARROW, JR. in Williams College, where he studied under the geologist Ebenezer Emmons and began selling geological specimens to supplement his family's meager allowance. A lack of academic preparation and continuing financial woes forced him to withdraw and enter Temple Hill Academy, which was much closer to his hometown. There he met his future wife, Phebe Howell, and his lifelong friend, Charles Wadsworth, both of whom shared his growing enthu- siasm for collecting mineralogical and geological specimens. When Ward heard that Louis Agassiz was to lecture in Rochester, he made the thirty-mile trip on foot and led the famed naturalist on a tour of the area surrounding his hometown. Impressed with the knowledge of his enthusiastic young guide, Agassiz invited Ward to become a special student at the MCZ, where he spent several months. He left the MCZ in May 1854 to accept an offer to join Charles Wadsworth in Paris, a trip that Wadsworth's father initially financed. His six years abroad proved crucial to the eventual success of his business. Not only did he obtain a thorough scientific education while regularly attending lectures at the Ecole des mines and the Jardin des plantes, but he also traveled widely throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; organized numerous collecting exped- itions; and became acquainted with the major natural history dealers and museum curators of Europe. By the time he returned to the United States in 1860, he had amassed an extensive geological collection, a unique series of fossil casts, and detailed, firsthand knowledge of how to conduct a natural history dealership.39 Although he was appointed professor of natural sciences at the University of Rochester shortly after his return, in the ensuing years Ward gradually abandoned his teaching career to build his private natural history enter- prise.40 His first major sale was to Vassar College, which in 1862 signed a contract to purchase a large geological cabinet from Ward (the price of which was not to exceed $8000). During the next few years he added zoolo- gical specimens to his constantly expanding inventory of minerals and fossil casts, erected two buildings as part of what soon became a large complex on the outskirts of the University of Rochester campus (Figures 3 and 4), and hired Grove Karl Gilbert, the first of many employees for whom Ward's Establishment became an initial stop on the way to prominent careers in science. Over the years there were many major setbacks - a devastating fire in 1869 and bankruptcy proceedings in 1874 and 1884 - but with continued financial underwriting from his wealthy uncle (and later their heirs), Ward 39 Kohlstedt, 1980, pp. 648-649; and Ward, 1948, pp. 55-122. 40 No doubt the modest salary he received from the university, "only a few hundred dollars per year," was one of the factors that led him to pursue commercial activities more vigorously.

For example, when officials at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York wanted an exhibition series of all the known North American birds and mammals in 1882, they contracted with Ward.44 He in turn approached members of his extensive collectors' network to fill the $10,000 order.45 A year later Ward signed a contract to supply the AMNH with "every species of monkey then known, with provisions for adding any found or discovered within three years."46 By 1896 total sales to the AMNH alone came to $28,048. Sales to other institutions were also brisk: the MCZ purchased $70,560 worth of specimens from Ward's; the University of Virginia, $51,000; Princeton College, $33,272; Coronado Beach Museum, California, $31,989; and the United States National Museum, $20,837. By the end of the nineteenth century, Ward's sales to 100 American museums had reached a total of over $730,223.47 Though impressive, these figures alone fail to convey the prominent role Ward also played in bringing several important urban and university museums into existence. Ward not only provided specimens for new museums, he often helped plant the idea, locate suitable patrons, initiate subscription drives, design exhibits, and otherwise work to bring his ambitious schemes to fruition.48 For example, before the Columbian Exposition of 1893, Ward borrowed over $50,000 to mount an extensive exhibit that occupied thirty freight cars en route to Chicago and over 11,000 square feet of floor space 41 Kohlstedt, 1980, pp. 649-654; and Ward, 1948, pp. 123-287. 42 Anonymous, 1883, blamed the late appearance of the Bulletin on the "museums, and colleges, and professors, and naturalists, and amateurs," who had "beset the establishment with their orders for collections and specimens." 43 Kohlstedt, 1980, pp. 651-652. 44 The transaction is discussed in J. B. Holder to George A. Boardman, July 8, 1882, George A. Boardman Papers, RU 7071, Box 1, Folder 17, SIA, Washington, D.C. 45 See, for example, Henry A. Ward to George A.

Ward, who had discovered previously that expositions often led to large specimen sales, was convinced he could persuade John D. Rockefeller to buy his massive exhibit for the newly established University of Chicago. When negotiations with university officials stalled, however, a nervous Ward pursued the Chicago department store magnate, Marshall Field, until he finally agreed to purchase the collection for $100,000. Ward's Columbian Exposition exhibit, together with anthropological material gathered for the fair by Frederic Ward Putnam, thereby became the nucleus for the Field Museum of Chicago, created in 1893.49 Ward's expanding business attracted many talented individuals who recog- nized the unique training experience the enterprise offered. By the late 1870s and early 1880s Ward's complex included about fifteen buildings and as many as twenty-two workers, including such prominent figures as William T. Hornaday, Frederic A. Lucas, and Frederic S. Webster (Figure 5). This ambi- tious group persuaded Ward to initiate a short-lived, irregularly published periodical, Ward's Natural Science Bulletin, which like most such ventures, was largely designed to publicize the business.50 In March 1880 several Ward employees also established a new organization, the Society of American Taxi- dermists, as part of a campaign to raise the general level of taxidermic practice and the standing of the profession in America.5' Toward that end, the new society held several meetings during which members exhibited specimens of their handiwork and received prizes for the best examples of scientific and artistic mounting. The society also issued several annual reports before falling into obscurity as its leaders became preoccupied with their own professional careers after leaving Ward's.52 Numerous other American naturalists and taxidermists also spent their formative years at Ward's, including Walter B. Barrows, William M. Wheeler, Carl Akeley, George K. Cherrie, Charles H. Townsend, and George B. Turner, 49 This account is from Ward, 1948, pp. 252-255. On the creation of the Field Museum, see also, Dexter, 1970; and Collier, 1969. 50 Ward credited his employee's as the impetus behind the periodical in the first number, Ward's Natural Science Bulletin 1 (June 1881): 1. 51 The story of the Society of American Taxidermists is told in detail in Dolph, 1975, and more briefly in Star, 1992, pp. 270-271.

BARROW, JR. to name just a few.53 Several Ward employees, including Ward's brother-in- law, Edwin Howell, and J. William Critchley, left to establish their own or to join existing natural history firms. According to the count of one former Ward associate, by the end of the nineteenth century, the "graduates" of Ward's included the "directors of three museums, the New York Aquarium, three college professors, the chief preparators of four of our greatest museums and many occupants of positions in other scientific institutions."54 It was a remarkable record and testimony to the importance of Ward's enterprise as a training ground for naturalists at the end of the nineteenth century. After selling much of his zoological stock to the Field Museum, Ward spent less and less time laboring at the business he had started. His withdrawal was partly related to his relatives' efforts to reign in Ward's always ambitious plans for finding new collections and promoting new museums, plans that often ignored the day-to-day economic realities of what was supposed to be a profitable business. In the last decade of his life he also became obsessed with collecting meteorites, which he pursued with a zeal that had become his trademark. With the financial support of his wealthy second wife, by 1904 Ward had amassed samples or entire meteorites representing more than 600 falls, making his collection arguably the largest in the world. He died in 1906, after being struck by an automobile while crossing the street in Buffalo, New York. The business that bears his name has continued to the present.55 Frank Blake Webster's Naturalists' Supply Depot In its size and longevity, Ward's Natural Science Establishment was certainly unique. But as I have already noted, Ward's enterprise was only a much grander example of a much more pervasive phenomenon. Although none of these ventures achieved the remarkable success of Ward's firm, the three deal- erships discussed below - Frank Blake Webster's Naturalists' Supply Depot, Southwick &amp; Jencks Natural History Store, and Frank H. Lattin &amp; Co. - each made a significant impact within the culture of collecting that emerged in the United States during the Gilded Age. Frank Blake Webster (1850-1922), a native of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, organized a natural history business in the mid-I 870s that rivaled Ward's in longevity, if not in total sales volume. In 1868, one year after graduating from 53 Wheeler and Akeley's years at Ward's are discussed in Bodry-Sanders, 1991; and Evans and Evans, 1970.

BARROW, JR. the Highland Military Academy at Worcester, Massachusetts, the eighteen- year-old Webster returned to his hometown to accept the first in a series of clerical positions. He soon ended up at the J. &amp; P. Coats Thread Company, where he was to remain for the next fourteen years as paymaster and invoice clerk.56 While Webster toiled away in the mill office, he dreamed of estab- lishing an enterprise more in keeping with his burning interest in natural history. After studying natural history and taxidermy informally during his spare hours for several years, he began taking more definite steps to bring his aspirations to fruition (Figure 6). In 1875 Webster found a kindred soul, A. L. Ellis, to help finance and operate a new business, which they soon launched as A. L. Ellis &amp; Co. As Webster later explained, he and his partner hoped to exploit the commer- cial opportunity represented by the increased popular interest in natural history: "The vast numbers scattered over the country who are engaged in making private collections, and who by the routine of life are confined to a locality, must look to others for assistance, and procure specimens from other localities either by purchase or exchange. This is often done by direct communication between collectors, but as a rule will be found to require a great deal of time and patience and liability to be tinted with disappointment. It was to meet a demand for centralization of exchange that stimulated the writer to establish the Naturalists' Supply Depot."57 The new business grew slowly but steadily until 1883, when it expanded rapidly after absorbing two of its nearby competitors. First came the purchase of the extensive zoological inventory of William J. Knowlton of Boston (successor to the well-known enterprise of Brewster &amp; Knowlton) when Knowlton decided to specialize in the sale of minerals and precious stones.58 One year later A. L. Ellis &amp; Co. bought the "business, stock, trade and goodwill" of Aldrich &amp; Capen, another Boston natural history establishment. Following this latest buyout, the partnership claimed to be in regular contact with "1,000 taxidermists and 4,000 collectors" across North America.59 56 The biographical sketch that follows is largely from two obituaries and a brief autobio- graphy: Anonymous, 1922; Preble, 1923; and Webster, 1890. 57 Webster, 1890, p. 168. 58 C. G. Brewster is listed among the "general dealers in specimens of natural history" in the first edition of The Naturalists' Directory, Putman, 1865, appendix, p. iii. By the 1877 edition of the Directory (Cassino, 1877), Brewster had joined forces with the mineralogist W. J. Knowlton. The firm took out one of the few full-page adds in this edition, which began: "Natural History Store, 18 Arch Street, Boston, Brewster &amp; Knowlton, Dealers in Birds, Shells and Minerals, also Objects of Natural History in General." 59 The claim is found on the back cover of the April 1884 issue of Ornithologist and Oologist 9.</page><page sequence="21">THE SPECIMEN DEALER 513 o 1^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~o CaIY LAI.I 460 lI|.I..,u-i.l 1. %, FW t 4.. z~~~~~~~~ Ye</page><page sequence="22">514 MARK V. BARROW, JR. Confident that the newly enlarged firm was now on sound footing, Webster resigned his clerical position at the mill to devote his full time to the busi- ness, which was renamed Ellis &amp; Webster. After a year of commuting daily between his home in Pawtucket and a new branch office in Boston, Webster purchased his partner's interest in the firm and closed the Pawtucket office. In 1888 Webster built a large workshop and storage facility in Hyde Park, the Boston suburb where he had made a home (Figure 7).60 Four years later he closed his Boston office and consolidated his mail-order and walk-in opera- tions at Hyde Park.6' He remained in charge of the business until his death in 1922.62 In January 1884, during the period when his business was rapidly expanding, Webster also purchased the Ornithologist and Oologist. The peri- odical, the first in North America devoted exclusively to ornithology, had begun publication as The Oologist in March 1875.63 The sixteen-year-old proprietor of the venture, Samuel L. Willard of Utica, New York, produced many of the early issues of the small, crudely printed monthly on his own press before joining forces with Joseph M. Wade, a textile mill agent from Rockville, Connecticut, in 1879. In 1880 Wade purchased Willard's share in the magazine, which he enlarged and renamed the Ornithologist and Oolo- gist. Wade published the periodical until November 1883, when he sold it to Webster. In his first two years of ownership, Webster issued nearly 40,000 copies, many of which he sent out as samples to increase the subscription base and advertise his business.64 Under Webster's ownership, the Ornithologist and Oologist continued to appeal to a broad spectrum of North American collectors, taxidermists, dealers, and even scientists until falling victim to the depression of 1893.65 In an effort to maintain a substantial and diverse inventory, Webster, like most larger dealers, developed a network of collectors and regularly sponsored expeditions. For example, in 1884 he and his partner Ellis announced to interested "Museums, Naturalists and Dealers" that they had arranged to receive the specimens of an experienced professional collector, Thomas Morris, who was departing for Trinidad and the Orinoco Valley 60 Webster, 1890, p. 169. 61 Webster, 1892. 62 Preble, 1923, p. 196. 63 The story of the Oologist and its transformation to the Omnithologist and Oologist is told in more detail in Burns, 1915; Willard, 1881; Bates, 1891; and Emerson, 1911. 64 Anonymous, 1886. 65 The periodical did provide a regular forum for criticism of scientific ornithology, which seemed to increasingly ignore the needs of less technically oriented collectors. See Barrow, 1998, pp. 54-56, 69, 85, 89, 91, 122-125, 170, and 176.</page><page sequence="23">THE SPECIMEN DEALER 515 in South America.66 But the most important of the many expeditions that Webster organized was an 1897 trip to the Galapagos Islands, whose unique fauna has long played an important role in the history of evolutionary biology.67 While Webster handled the details of mounting the expedition, Walter Rothschild - the wealthy British eccentric who was amassing one of the world's most important natural history collections at his estate in Tring Park outside London - financed it.68 In March 1897 the five-man Webster-Rothschild expedition party left New York bound for Panama, where it attempted unsuccessfully to secure a ship. Following a bout with yellow fever - which proved fatal for the leader and one other member of the expedition - the group headed back north to San Fran- cisco. Following lengthy negotiations, Charles M. Harris, the expedition's new leader, finally chartered a suitable boat and recruited two additional taxi- dermists and another collector, Rollo H. Beck, to join the expedition.69 After spending four months of their nine-month journey exploring the islands in the Galapagos Archipelago, the expedition party returned home with a cargo that included 3075 bird skins, 400 birds' eggs, 13 seals, 150 iguanas, 65 tortoises (many of which were still alive), 40 tortoise eggs, 8 turtles, 6 centipedes, and several hundred lizards and marine invertebrates.70 Like many other natural history dealerships and taxidermy establishments, Webster's also became a frequent gathering place for local naturalists, who regularly stopped in to socialize, to search through recent acquisitions, and to purchase specimens. For example, the naturalist Edward Preble, who later went on to a career in the Bureau of the Biological Survey, recalled with fondness his frequent youthful visits to Webster's: "Some of the pleasantest recollections of my boyhood are concerned with visits to his establishment, where I sometimes assisted him in arranging eggs or skins."71 It was the kind of encouragement that often led to a lifelong interest and even subsequent careers in natural history. 66 The announcement appeared on the back cover of Ornithologist and Oologist 9 (March 1884). 67 See, for example, Sulloway, 1982; and Wiener, 1996. 68 The story of the expedition is told in a fascinating biography written by Walter Rothschild's niece: Rothschild, 1983. 69 This was to be the first of many international expeditions in the career of Rollo Beck; see Murphy, 1936, 1: 2-8; and Pitelka, 1986. 70 Rothschild, 1983, p. 201. 71 Preble, 1923, p. 197.</page><page sequence="24">516 MARK V. BARROW, JR. Southwick &amp; Jencks' Natural History Store Southwick &amp; Jencks' Natural History Store of Providence, Rhode Island, began just one year later and just down the road from Webster's first Pawtucket finm. Like Webster's Natural History Depot, Southwick &amp; Jencks' amassed a large inventory of specimens through an extensive network of collectors and a series of sponsored expeditions. And like Webster's, South- wick &amp; Jencks' also catered primarily to individual collectors. But during the second half of the nineteenth century, when scientific natural history was almost entirely focused on collecting, the firm also regularly sold specimens to the museums and scientifically oriented private collectors. The enterprise began in the mid- 1 870s, when a thirty-year-old dry goods store owner, James M. Southwick (1846-1904), rented part of a friend's store and began filling it with a small stock of specimens during his spare moments. Southwick hoped eventually to bring together enough material to open a new business more in keeping with his long-held passion for natural history.72 In 1876 he met Fred T. Jencks, an enthusiastic nineteen-year-old who had recently learned how to skin and mount birds from J. W. P. Jenks (no rela- tion), professor of agricultural zoology and founder of the museum of natural history at Brown University.73 Following basic lessons in taxidermy, Jencks had assisted his mentor during a three-month-long collecting expedition to Florida.74 On December 1, 1876, only five days after first meeting each other, Southwick and Jencks launched their new firm. The partners were aware that it would take time and hard work to make their new enterprise a success.75 Initially Southwick continued to work at his dry goods business, while Jencks minded the natural history store. Hoping to attract a national clientele, the firm soon began advertising in natural history periodicals and issued widely distributed catalogs of birds and eggs, minerals, shells, and supplies. Within three years, business prospects were lively enough to rent out an entire store, hire an assistant, and permit Southwick to abandon his dry goods business.76 By 1884, the same year in which Webster began publishing Ornithologist and Oologist, the firm initiated its own monthly periodical with the unusually 72 The early history of the establishment is told in Anonymous, 1885, pp. 16-17. 73 Brief biographical sketches of J.

Like most such ventures, the periodical contained a mixture of advice to collectors, local lists of flora and fauna (focusing on the Rhode Island region), collecting exploits, and (most importantly) copious quantities of advertising, especially from the sponsoring firm. And as usually was the case, distributing sample copies of the new periodical became an important part of the partners' efforts to promote their expanding business. The firm maintained regular contact with a spectrum of collectors, ranging from the rank beginner to the professional scientist. Jencks established a particularly close relationship with the ornithologist Robert Ridgway, who identified uncertain birds, vouched for the integrity of the firm, and helped locate collectors to provide the partners with a steady supply of specimens.77 Ridgway, in turn, exchanged specimens with Jencks, received the right of first refusal for rare or unusual acquisitions, and used the Southwick &amp; Jencks catalog as a means to value the bird skins traded between the Smithsonian and other collectors and dealers. In October 1886 Jencks was forced to sell out his interest in the busi- ness following a recurrent bout with an unspecified eye ailment.78 Southwick continued to run the firm alone for several years, but announced that with the December 1886 issue he was discontinuing Random Notes on Natural History: "[T]here seems to be no special need for this publication except to advertise my business. In view of the numberless claims upon my time by my constantly expanding business, I can do this to better advantage through other channels."79 For a time Southwick joined forces with J. William Critchley, formerly of Ward's Natural Science Establishment, before selling out in 1894 to Walter A. Angell and Harry A. Cash, who continued to operate their firm for many years under the name of Angell &amp; Cash.80 After selling his business, Southwick became curator of the natural history museum at Roger Williams Park; in Providence, Rhode Island.8' 77 See, for example, Fred T.

Lattin &amp; Co. Another important natural history establishment located less than forty miles west of Ward's Rochester enterprise, Frank H. Lattin &amp; Co., also catered to the growing popular interest in natural history. Lattin's large retail and wholesale business - which specialized in oological specimens and supplies - enjoyed a period of impressive growth in the 1 880s and early 1 890s before falling victim to the economic depression of the mid-I 890s and increasingly stringent bird protection legislation that came in the wake of the turn-of- the-century Audubon movement. During his years of operation, however, Lattin's enterprise became an important supplier of ornithological specimens and supplies, introduced the world of ornithology to thousands, and helped to legitimize the activities of a growing number of bird skin and egg collectors. The product of a farming family of moderate means, Frank Haak Lattin (1861-1937; Figure 9) began collecting natural history specimens while a youth.82 By the time he was in high school, the native of Gaines, New York, placed a series of exchange notices in collecting-oriented periodicals to secure more correspondents with whom to trade specimens. He soon discovered that many collectors who answered his advertisements, especially those in urban areas, lacked the necessary duplicates with which to undertake exchanges and were more interested in purchasing specimens outright. To capitalize on this newly discovered opportunity, Lattin created a small mail- order natural history business in 1881. Lattin used his spare hours to nourish his growing business while serving briefly as principal of the village school in Gaines and reading law with a local firm in the neighboring town of Albion. Lattin's decision to launch a monthly periodical, The Young Oologist in May of 1884 - the same year that Webster and Southwick &amp; Jencks began their own trade journal - reflected an increasing dedication to his expanding business and his determination to begin specializing in oological specimens and supplies. As part of an ongoing effort to gain a larger circulation for his new publication (and bring publicity to his natural history enterprise), Lattin widely distributed sample copies of The Young Oologist as well as its successor, The Oologist, while offering specimens as premiums to those who became, or induced others to become, regular subscribers to the publica- tions.83 He also created a short-lived omithological association, The Knights of Audubon, with the hope of emulating Harlan Ballard's remarkable success 82 The biographical information on Frank H. Lattin that follows comes from a series of sketches of his life: Anonymous, 1894; Malcolm, 1918; Malcolm, 1930, p. 66; Holmes, 1924, p. 761; and Grant, 1920. 83 For example, Lattin claimed to have distributed 5,000 copies of the first issue of The Young Oologist 1 (1884): 9. Most of the premiums offered came from Lattin's stock. By October 1884 Lattin claimed 1,063 regular subscribers (The Young Oologist 1 [18841: 88).</page><page sequence="28">520 MARK V.

For nearly two decades Lattin's natural history establishment did a booming business by catering primarily to individual collectors.

It was not only a catalog of specimens available to collectors through Lattin, but also a widely accepted basis from which to value specimens intended for exchange. During the mid-1880s Lattin continued to expand what had until that point been largely a mail-order enterprise. In 1886 he opened two natural history and "curiosity" stores for walk-in customers at Chautauqua, New York, the site of the educational, religious, and cultural center that attracted thousands to the shores of Lake Erie each summer.86 These two shops were the first of several branch locations Lattin opened within the next few years in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Chicago, Illinois. While he was experimenting with retail outlets, Lattin continued to push the wholesale side of his business. For example, in 1886 he sold "an immense stock of eggs" for $2500 to W. C. Brownwell of Plymouth, Michigan, who wanted to open a business of his own.87 A year later he sold $3350 worth of "birds, eggs, specimens and supplies" to an established business, R. B. Trouslot and Co., of Valparaiso, Indiana.88 He also bought out the oological stock of two large dealers, C. J. Maynard, of Boston, Massachusetts, and Oliver Davie, of Columbus, Ohio.89 Both had decided to give up the sale of specimens following increasing involvement in publication efforts. Like Ward, Lattin found that large fairs and exhibitions represented an excellent opportunity to place his wares before the public. For example, Lattin exhibited specimens, books, and supplies at the Chicago Exposition in 1886, the Buffalo International Fair in 1888, and the Detroit International Fair in 1891. But his most ambitious effort was at the Chicago Exposition in 1893. Prior to the event Lattin sold one-half interest in his business to another dealer, Walter F. Webb of Geneva, New York.90 Frank H. Lattin &amp; Co.'s 2000-square-foot exhibit of bird skins and eggs, shells, taxidermy, and from Ballard's Handbook of the Agassiz Association. Lattin's idea was quickly abandoned. The name, however, was soon taken up by a short-lived bird protection organization, The Audubon Society, created in 1886 by George Bird Grinnell, and by a subsequent series of state and national organizations that endure to this day.

In 1894 he dissolved his partner- ship with Walter F. Webb.93 A year later Lattin announced that he had sold his mail-order business including his "entire stock of Birds Eggs and Skins, and Naturalists' Instruments and Supplies with a good general assortment of Minerals, Fossils, Indian Relics, Shells (all of my duplicate scientific ones), Corals, Echinoderms, Land and Marine Curios, and specimens of all kinds" to one of his former employees, Ernest H. Short. Lattin retained an interest in The Oologist and The Natural Science News (a short-lived weekly that he had just started) as well as his "jobbing and resort business."94 In 1899 Lattin, who had recently earned a degree from the medical school at the University of Buffalo, announced that he was liquidating his remaining stock as quickly as he could.95 Five years later Lattin hired Short to edit The Oologist, which began to loose money with the gradual decline of interest in egg collecting that followed in the wake of the Audubon movement. In 1909 Lattin sold the periodical to Short, who published it for only three months before selling out to R. M. Barnes, a lawyer and avid bird egg collector from Lacon, Illinois. Barnes continued to publish the magazine for the next thirty-two years before allowing it to lapse into obscurity.96 Conclusion Natural history dealers faced many obstacles in their effort to eke out a living from the sale of specimens. When the economy was strong, maintaining a steady inventory of merchandise remained a constant challenge. When the economy languished, however, as it did with increasing frequency at the end of the nineteenth century, the demand for specimens tended to dry up, and dealers were often forced into bankruptcy. During this same period, postal 91 Ridgway, 1901. 92 Lattin, 1894, p. 38. 93 Shortly after parting with Lattin, Webb began his own periodical, The Museum, as an outlet to publicize his natural history business. He also published Webb, 1895, a competitor to Lattin's popular oology manual. 94 Lattin, 1895. 95 Lattin, 1899. 96 An account of Barnes and his association with the periodical is found in the last issue, Oologist 58 (1941): 147-162.</page><page sequence="31">THE SPECIMEN DEALER 523 officials initiated periodic campaigns to deny preferential second mailing class rates to dealers who issued trade journals, thus increasing the cost of a form of advertising that many merchant naturalists found effective.97 Changing tastes in interior decoration posed another threat to specimen dealers. Although it is difficult to say exactly how many, a significant portion of the specimens that dealers sold were destined for the homes and offices of individuals who seemed more interested in conforming to the latest trends in home fashion rather than in serious, methodical collecting or study. During the late-Victorian period the typical middle-class household was heaped to the brim with a dizzying array of pictures, books, and natural objects. This was especially true of that quintessentially Victorian institution, the parlor, which served as a kind of semi-public memory palace.98 At the turn of the century this aesthetic of exuberance gradually gave way to the more austere aesthetic of the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized cleaner design lines and frowned on clutter. In 1900, as part of an ongoing campaign to simplify home interiors, the magazine editor Edward Bok declared that "[t]he curse of the American home to-day is useless bric-brac."99 Increasingly Americans took Bok's advice to heart, thereby reducing the demand for natural history specimens as decorative objects. Those dealers who relied on the sales of bird and mammal specimens faced an additional hurdle at the end of the nineteenth century: changing public attitudes about the legitimacy of collecting these obviously sentient creatures. Tension had long existed between the entrepreneurial and romantic impulses that informed the desire to amass and display natural objects.'o? The establishment of many businesses devoted to the sale of natural history specimens tended to reinforce the idea that nature was nothing more than a resource or commodity, existing solely for human ends. For example, the wide distribution of natural history dealers' catalogs undoubtedly influenced the ornithologist Elliott Coues to declare in his popular collecting manual of 1874: "How many examples of the same bird do you want? - All you can get . Bird skins are capital."lo' Romanticism challenged the economic calculus that undergirded the commodification of nature. Certainly the romantic sensibility alerted collectors to discover beauty in the natural objects around them and was a major factor promoting the large-scale growth of natural history collecting. 97 Barrow, 1998, pp. 14-15. 98 Greir, 1992. 99 Shi, 1985, pp. 186-193, on p. 187. 100 This is not unlike the basic distinction between Arcadian and imperialistic science that Donald Worster (1985) makes. 101 Coues, 1874, p. 12. First emphasis is in the original, while the second is mine.</page><page sequence="32">524 MARK V. BARROW, JR. But romanticism also suggested that our interactions with nature were imbued with an aesthetic and spiritual dimension that defied simple economic valu- ation. For some followers the doctrine even implied that humans ought to be kinder and gentler in their dealings with the natural world.102 This was especially true of birds and mammals, which engaged in behaviors that were quite easy to characterize in anthropomorphic terms. The fundamental tension between these opposing conceptions of nature remained largely unarticulated until rise of the Audubon movement and the growth of popular interest in birdwatching around 1900. 103 Among the tens of the thousands of Americans who joined Audubon societies were some wildlife advocates who felt that all bird and mammal collecting was anathema. Working with a broad range of less strident protec- tionists, they translated their concerns into educational campaigns designed to raise consciousness about the threat of declining wildlife populations, the creation of nature sanctuaries designed to protect native species from human predation, and most importantly in this context, a series of state and federal bird protection laws. Most of these laws included a provision allowing for scientific collecting of protected species, but the individuals charged with enforcing them increasingly viewed much private collecting and most commercial collecting as illegitimate (and hence, illegal). Even in states where they might have been able to obtain collecting permits, many collectors began to find more satisfaction in wildlife observation. While some dealers failed to survive these challenges, others attempted to address them by changing the emphasis of their business. For example, Walter F. Webb, Frank H. Lattin's erstwhile business partner, gradually stopped carrying birds and eggs and began to focus more on shells, for which the demand remained healthy well into the twentieth century. With a stock that included as many as 25,000 different species, Webb soon gained a reputa- tion as one of the "leading suppliers of specimen shells in the world."''04 As sales to individuals and larger museums began to decline, Ward's Natural Science Establishment began catering more to high schools and colleges that wanted modest representative collections of plants, shells, insects, and rocks and minerals to use in teaching.105 The demand for these kinds of collec- tions increased dramatically with the nature study movement that emerged at 102 See, for example, Mighetto, 1991. On the humane movement more broadly, see Turner, 1980. 103 On the rise of the Audubon movement and it relationship to bird collecting and birdwatching, see Barrow, 1998, pp. 102-181; Doughty, 1975; and Graham, 1990. 104 Dance, 1986, p. 183; Abbott, p. 173; and Benson, 1994. 105 Ward's relatives, who provided financial backing for his business, had encouraged him to move in this direction in the mid-I 870s.

Reed, a taxidermist and natural history dealer from Worcester, Massachusetts, found his business prospects declining at the beginning of the twentieth century, he and his son, Chester A. Reed, began catering more to birdwatchers and wildflower enthu- siasts (Figure 10).107 Together they published a series of extremely popular field guides to birds and flowers, several of which remained in print until the 1950s. By 1933 they had sold more than 600,000 copies of their bird guides alone. 108 At the same time, a healthy increase in training and career opportunities in natural history opened up a variety of new prospects for would-be naturalists. Many individuals who might have previously established their own specimen businesses or worked for another dealer now had the option of pursuing the study of natural history in the newly reformed colleges, which were admit- ting more students and placing increasing emphasis on science education, or the newly emerging universities, which began offering graduate degrees in various branches of biology.109 This curricular expansion also provided naturalists with access to more faculty positions at institutions of higher learning. State fish and game commissions, which were charged with helping to formulate wildlife policy and administer an increasingly complex series of wildlife laws, experienced a similar growth in the first half of the twen- tieth century, thus providing another avenue of employment for those who were inclined toward natural history.' 10 The Progressive-era push for a more activist, expert-informed government also led to the expansion of employ- ment opportunities for naturalists."I 1 Federal agencies, like the Bureau of the Biological Survey, the Bureau of Economic Entomology, and the Bureau of Fisheries, all experienced impressive growth during this period. Natural history dealerships were the product of a series of social, tech- nological, scientific, and cultural developments in the decades following the Civil War. They were born in an age that witnessed the tremendous growth 06 Kohlstedt, 1997; Henson, 1997; and Keeney, 1992, pp. 135-145. 107 Charles K. Reed had at least one brush with the law when the New York Audubon Society claimed that some specimens he was preparing for exhibition at the St. Louis World's Fair had been taken in violation of Massachusetts game laws. See, Anonymous, 1904. A year later he sold his remaining stock of birds' eggs to Frank H. Lattin. See the notice in The Oologist 23 (1906): 67. 108 See the discussion in Barrow, 1992, pp. 158 and 165. They did not entirely abandon their interest in taxidermy.

A variety of enterprising naturalists scrambled to exploit this new niche. The commercial enterprises they created provided specimens, publication outlets, training, and jobs for naturalists of all motivations and levels of expertise, while strongly promoting the continued expansion of the broad public interest in natural history upon which their success depended.
