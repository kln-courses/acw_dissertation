Oikonomos, the Director of the Greek Archaeological Department; to Professors Shear and Morgan, and others of the American School; to M. Paul Lemerle, the Secretary-General of the French School; to Drs. Hampe and Kfibler of the German Institute; and to Dr. Sdiflund of the Swedish excavations. They are in no way responsible for errors in this account. ATHENS AND ATTICA In August 1937 the National Museum received an acquisition of the first importance. It had been known for some time that a marble kouros had been dug up at Anavysos in Attica by a gang of tomb-robbers in 1932, and smuggled out of the country. The general activities of this gang came afterwards to the notice of the authorities, and the men were brought to trial. In the course of the evidence the story of the kouros was dis- closed, and subsequent investigations revealed the fact that it had come into the hands of a Greek dealer in Paris. The latter was induced to restore it to the Greek authorities, who conveyed it to Athens. The statue is in ten fragments, which are now in the workshops of the National Museum awaiting reconstruction. Most of the breaks are new. The smugglers had severed the torso and arms, and broken off the hands at the wrists and at the points where they touch the thighs. The head and upper part of the torso are in good preservation except for a slight break in the nose. The statue is a magnificent work of the middle of the sixth century. The excavations of the American School under Shear's direction in and around the Agora were continued, with important results, between the end of January and the middle of June. A large area was cleared on the north-west slopes of the Acropolis, to the south-east of the previous excavation. Here ran the ancient way, now uncovered, from the Agora to the Acropolis, in the same general alignment as was afterwards followed by the Valerian wall, which lies over the roadway along its eastern edge. At a point just north of the new motor road, now being constructed on the north side of the Acropolis, the ancient road seems to have curved away towards the west, and so round to the foot of the Acropolis ascent, in order to provide a suitable gradient for vehicles. There must also have been a JHS-VOL. LVII. K</page><page sequence="2">120 GERARD M. YOUNG footway leading direct to the Acropolis ascent. This was enlarged in the first or second century A.D. into a stair ten metres in width, of which little now remains beyond the foundations of the parapets and the traces of ramps. In the neighbourhood of the Klepsydra, towards the southern end of the Valerian wall, the stairway was traversed by the Turkish fortification wall which ran round the Acropolis. The stairway and its surroundings at this point were practically obliterated by the explosion of a Turkish mine in 1822. In July Parsons cleared out and examined the ancient basin of the Klepsydra, entering it by a shaft which descends about 8-50 metres from the floor of the ' Chapel of the Holy Apostles.' At about half a metre below the bottom of this shaft he came upon the floor of the basin. This runs nearly north and south, and measures about 4.50 x 2-25 metres. The original walls are preserved almost intact. They and the floor are con- structed of poros blocks, beautifully cut and jointed. The north, east and south walls are built up to the overhanging rock. The west wall rises to a height of four metres above the floor, leaving a space of three metres between its summit and the rock above. Rope and bucket marks show clearly that it was over this parapet that water was drawn. At a much later date the west wall was carried up to the rock, and a narrow entrance made from the north. Later still, but certainly before the construction of the Valerian wall in the last quarter of the third century, a new well-house of concrete masonry was built on the overhanging shelf, on the east side, and connected with the Acropolis by a stairway cut in the rock. This is, in fact, the building now used as a chapel, and the present shaft belongs to it. The basin was fed by four inlets on the east side. One of these was subsequently blocked up. They are very carefully constructed and lined with archaic roof-tiles of island marble. There is no external evidence as yet for the date of construction, but the style and workmanship are not incompatible with a date in the late fifth century. The examination will be continued next year. A noteworthy discovery in the section lying east of the Valerian wall was the foundation of a late archaic building on the rising ground to the south of the Stoa of Attalos. A small portion of this foundation was uncovered last year. The building had originally a length of 15-60 metres and a width of 8-70 metres extended by additions, which appear to have been almost contemporary, to 18-o5 and I I10 metres respectively. The foundation blocks, on which lifting bosses still remain, are of very fine workmanship. The building stood on ground rising steeply towards the south, and was supported on the north side by a retaining wall. It lay in a small temenos enclosed by a polygonal wall. Farther to the south are the remains of an early Roman circular building, containing poros blocks apparently taken from an earlier and larger circular building which may have occupied the same site. The whole area east of the Valerian wall is much disturbed, but produced nevertheless some important finds. One of these was a statue base, with an inscription recording that the statue upon it was of Archippe, wife of Cleogenes of Aixone, dedicated by her mother Archippe, and made</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 121 by Praxiteles. The base of a bronze statue dedicated by Herodes Atticus to his friend the Consul Civica Barbarus was also found. A well in this locality produced late Geometric and proto-Attic pottery, including a late Geometric amphora with plastic snakes on rim and shoulder, and a hydria-neck with a continuous frieze of ten women holding hands and carrying palm-branches. The area on the north-west slopes of the Acropolis produced an important yield of prehistoric pottery from various pits and wells. Many complete vases were found, and a great quantity of sherds. The pottery falls into two main categories, Late Neolithic and Middle Helladic. Some coarse pottery of the Early Helladic period was also found, but no late Helladic pieces. Three of the Middle Helladic vases are illustrated in Fig. I. Further north along the Acropolis road and close to the Stoa of Attalos the remains of a row of standing and seated statues of the Roman period were disclosed. Five of these have so far been recovered. Opposite the Stoa the road widens out into a large open space, between which and the FIG. I.-ATHENS: MIDDLE HELLADIC VASES FROM NORTH-WEST SLOPE OF THE ACROPOLIS. centre of the Stoa foundations, measuring approximately 8-50 x 6 metres, have been found. A striking topographical discovery of this season's work is that of the foundations of a Greek peripteral Doric temple, measuring 36.36 x 16.76 metres, with 6 x 13 columns lying north-west of the Odeion, and south of the Altar of the Twelve Gods. This temple was destroyed probably in Sulla's pillage and completely rebuilt in early Roman times. The only large temple in the Agora area so far unaccounted for is the temple of Ares, and the site answers well enough to Pausanias's description of its position. Thompson has published the results of his examination of the buildings on the west side of the Agora, as far south as the Bouleuterion (Hesperia 1937, I), and has since turned his attention to the Tholos. Late sixth- century houses were discovered at a low depth around and beneath the Tholos site, and the fill between the west side of the building and the rock yielded late black-figure sherds, and ostraka, of which several bore the name of Themistocles. The original Tholos can accordingly be assigned to about the time of the Persian wars. The building had a diameter of about eighteen metres. Its roof was supported by six columns, arranged so as to form a hexagon, the north and south sides of which are, however,</page><page sequence="4">122 GERARD M. YOUNG nearly half as long again as the other sides (the main entrance to the build- ing would seem to have been from the north). The three pillars on each side, east and west, are set upon a wider arc than the curve of the building itself. The building appears to have been restored and added to in the third century B.c., destroyed during Sulla's invasion and rebuilt soon afterwards. In Imperial times a different method of roofing must have been adopted, since a thin pavement of marble belonging to a restoration of this period covered the bases of the six columns. Two pits on the north side of the Tholos contained a large number of plain fifth-century cups, some of which were inscribed with the monogram L_ (for Demos). They were doubtless State vessels used in the Tholos itself. The excavations were continued also in the areas north and south of the Hephaisteion. In the former the remains of several more bronze foundries were discovered, with their water-channels and cisterns. A stairway of about eight metres broad, of uncertain date, was located, leading from the Sacred Gate road southwards, up the steep hill to the north of the Hephaisteion, on to the terrace of the temple itself. South of the Hephai- steion numerous wells and cisterns were cleared. One yielded a quantity of late fifth-century pottery and other objects, including an unfinished statuette of Herakles. Among the vases may be mentioned an amphora with a procession of garlanded youths, labelled EYHOMHOI, led by the mythical KOVIPEY2. The precise significance of the scene is not clear. It seems to have no direct connexion with the Heracleidae of Euripides. Another vase, a krater, depicts a sacrifice-youths and maidens are dragging a bull to an altar which stands under a tree; a herm is seen in the background. Among other individual finds may be noted: (I) a red-figure column-krater, with a youth playing a double flute on one side, and a discobolos on the other, attributed to Myson. (2) A red-figure fragment, about 470 B.c., showing the Judgment of Paris-part of a large kantharos, fragments of which had been found in previous years. (3) A red-figure amphora by the painter of the Leningrad Amazonomachy. In front is a charioteer, in long chiton, driving a team of three horses. A Nike wearing a Doric chiton and an em- broidered sakkos, and carrying an amphora of Panathenaic shape, flies above. At the back a winged female figure, in a chiton and himation, holds out a patera to a bearded male figure wearing an himation and holding a lotus-tipped staff in his right hand. (4) An interesting set of three small weights, a stater, a quarter- stater and a one-sixth stater, was found together with the first of the above vases. Each weight bears the words AEMO5ION AEENAION or AEMOXION AGENAION engraved on the sides, and a relief on its upper surface. The stater has an astragalos, the quarter-stater a shield, and the one-sixth stater a tortoise. The finds include also a large number of fragments of inscriptions, which will be published in due course, and sixty ostraka.</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 123 Broneer has continued his excavations on the north-east slopes of the Acropolis. An area of about 1400 square metres, extending from the rrEpi-rcrros below the sanctuary of Eros and Aphrodite down to the modern road, has been cleared. Several of the squatters' houses on the upper slope were acquired by the American School for the purpose, and some twenty-five refugees' houses on the lower slope were removed in the spring of 1937, and their inhabitants housed in permanent dwellings by the Greek Government. In addition to the main area, a small section higher up the slope, directly to the north of the sanctuary of Eros and Aphrodite, was excavated, and the underground passage west of the Erechtheion explored. The former produced some prehistoric pottery, and the latter several inscriptions of interest and some sculptural fragments, as well as a great many sherds, mostly Mycenaean. No ancient buildings and few objects of topographical interest came to light. The movable finds are, however, numerous and important. About 130 fragments of inscriptions were found, ranging from the sixth century B.C. to the Byzantine epoch. These include a fragment of the Athena Promachos inscription, a piece of the Erechtheion accounts, several fragments of inventory records of the fifth and fourth centuries, and numerous pieces of decrees of the fourth and third centuries. The principal finds came from ancient wells and cuttings. One well, about eighteen metres deep, contained, near the top, an archaic bronze horse and rider, of fine workmanship and in good preservation, except that the horse's feet are missing, and its legs twisted. The statuette is an extreme example of two early archaic features-the diminutiveness of the rider, and his position on the peak of the horse's withers. In the same well, lower down, were found the fragments of a large black- figure krater of Exekias, the following description of which is kindly supplied by Broneer. 'On the one side is depicted the introduction of Herakles into Olympos. The figures of Herakles and Athena are lost, but part of Herakles' name remains. The deities whose figures are pre- served are: Apollo, Artemis, Poseidon and Hermes, all with their names affixed, and one other female figure, probably Iris. The horses and the front of the chariot are also preserved. On the other side is a scene of Greek and Trojan warriors fighting over the body of Patrokles. In the lower zone on either side are figures of two lions in the act of killing a bull, and at the handles are figures of women and running satyrs. About one-third of the krater is missing. The base shows signs of having been mended in antiquity. The style of the decoration is typically that of Exekias. Above the figures of the gods is the inscription ONETOPIAEX KALOX. This name, which appears only on vases of Exekias, leaves no room for doubt as to the identity of the artist. It is likely that the signature of Exekias was inscribed on the missing portion above the warrior scene.' The krater and the horseman are now set up in the museum of the American excavations in the Agora. Other important finds are a fine black-figure hydria, decorated with figures of women carrying wreaths, a black-figure jug with Athena and Dionysos, and a fragment of a painted terracotta plaque, which Broneer</page><page sequence="6">124 GERARD M. YOUNG thinks was probably a metope, showing the face and left arm of a bearded figure holding a harp. In the same well as the plaque were found an ostrakon of Kimon son of Miltiades, and no fewer than 192 ostraka of Themistokles, mostly on kylix bases. The British School spent a week in February examining the large dump of earth from the Acropolis excavations of 1884-89, which lies in front of the cave on the east face. Good pottery fragments have often come to the surface in this locality after rain, and in 1936 Broneer, when examin- ing the cave itself, had found there a number of important sherds, some of which join with Acropolis vases (Hesperia V. 2, 247 ff., and JHS Ivi, 135). This year's search produced some interesting sherds, including good black-figure fragments of the second half of the sixth century, and a quantity of fifth-century red-figure, one piece of which belongs to a known vase (Graef-Langlotz, Acropolisvasen II, i, pl. 10, 211). But the out- standing find was a fine bronze fragment, consisting of the legs and feet of a kouros, standing between two rams, one of which is preserved intact. Miss Constantinou, the keeper of the bronzes in the National Museum, identified the fragment as belonging to Acropolis No. 6588 (De Ridder, p. 250, fig. 222), and a further search among the Acropolis bronzes in the Museum disclosed the fact that the bronze lion, Acropolis No. 6650 (De Ridder, p. 168), is part of the same piece. The head of the kouros makes a perfect join with the lion, but the ends of the thighs were unfortunately levelled off when the piece was mounted, and cannot now be joined to the new fragment. The height of the figure (P1. V) was about 16 centimetres. The fragments belong to an oinochoe handle of a popular archaic pattern, composed of a naked youth, who stands between two rams, and grasps the tails of two lions lying on either side of his head. The youth's body and head are hollow at the back. They must have fitted over an attachment which completed the handle and took the weight of the vase. The lions were similarly hollowed to fit the curves of a trefoil mouth. By this arrangement the designer was enabled to set the figure of the youth in a natural position, instead of bending it violently backwards, as in almost all other known examples. Traces of a similar attachment may be seen at the back of an unpublished handle (without rams) in the Ashmolean (no. 221), and at the back of a fragmentary handle (lower part missing) from Laconia in the Louvre (no. 2785). Except that it belonged to a vessel with a circular mouth, the Louvre handle, in its upper part, is very similar in form to the handle from the Acropolis. It is, however, markedly different in style; and there seems no reason to doubt that the handle from the Acropolis is Attic. It may be dated about 520 B.c. The German excavation of the Kerameikos, under the direction of Kiibler, was continued from November toJanuary, and again in the summer. A detailed report, by Johannes and Gebauer, will appear in AA I937. The pottery finds do not compare with those of preceding years, but the topo- graphical results are important. Further excavation between the Dipylon and the Spartans' grave has brought to light the water-heating chamber and connected supply system of the circular bath-house, and the duration of the bath-house itself has been established, with the aid of an ostrakon ofMegakles,</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 125 as lying between 486 and 404-3, when the bath-house was given up and the Spartans' grave constructed. The first water-heating arrangements were developed out of existing potters' kilns, which are therefore the earliest Attic pottery kilns known to us. The post-holes referred to in JHS Ivi, I4o are now conjectured to have belonged to a platform, from which funeral orations were delivered. Between the marble Roman sarcophagus in front of the Dipylon and the circular bath-house, many graves were excavated, of which three are Submycenaean, twenty-two Geometric, and four late sixth- century. The Geometric graves belong for the most part to the first half of the eighth century. Kilbler associates this series of graves with those previously found in the Hagia Trias section. Kourouniotis and Travlos have explored sections of the Sacred Way in the region between the temple of Aphrodite and the ancient Rheitoi. They have also finished the excavations in Eleusis itself, and uncovered a large Roman house near the museum. Further excavations took place in the necropolis at Vari (JHS Ivi, I43) under the direction of Oikonomos in conjunction with Stavropoulos, with funds supplied from the Singer-Polignac foundation. The result has not disappointed the expectations raised by the discovery of the temple deposit in 1934-35 (JHS Iv, I54), though the majority of the finds, extend- ing as they do from the end of the seventh down into the fifth century, belong to a later period. Most of the pottery was recovered not from the actual graves, but from sacrificial channels and other surroundings. The fragments have been put together in the Archaeological Society's building. They comprise a rich variety of vases of many shapes. Perhaps the most interest- ing piece of all is a funeral car in terracotta. Four mourning women stand on the platform round the coffin, over which a pall is spread. Two plastic figures, a running man and a bird, lie on the pall. The lid is re- movable, disclosing the figure of the dead man lying in the coffin. A driver stands on the platform in front. The car is drawn by a single horse, on which a rider is seated. The decoration throughout is in brown on a light background. Other pottery includes: a tall footed cup, with three mourning women on the rim, and several stands with similar decoration; a large plate with heraldic lions; a horned animal on wheels, with six amphoriskoi on its back; a stand, with three pointed jars upside down upon it; several terracotta horses and birds; a large plate with running Gorgon, (P1. VI, I); large skyphoi with animal friezes in Corinthian style; a kantharos-in front, Herakles wrestling with a Triton, which has a snake rising out of his back-at the back, a four-horsed chariot (P1. VI, 4) ; a black-figure jug with lion and bull (P1. VI, 2) ; a four-handled kothon with animal frieze on the rim; three fine cups with gorgoneia; a jug with two warriors attacking a bearded man in himation, standing male figures at the side; lekythos with hunters returning (P1. VI, 3); black- and red-figure loutrophoroi; and many other vases. In 1937 some more graves were opened, but these were poorly furnished. The excavations will be renewed next year.</page><page sequence="8">126 GERARD M. -YOUNG THE MEGARID Threpaiades has excavated on two sites at Megara, in the modern town, and at the cave of Mourmounes. On the former site he found lime- stone foundations and hypocausts of a large Roman bath. THE PELOPONNESE Corinth. The American School has carried on its excavations, directed by Morgan, at Corinth. To the west of the Bouleuterion excavated in 1936 five more shops have been uncovered in the Stoa area. One of these contained a marble head of Serapis, ornamented with gold leaf, of the second century A.D. To the north of the Stoa shops two late Geometric graves were found, containing some undecorated hand-made pottery. West of the Agora, under the site of the demolished church of St. John the Theologian, the foundations of an earlier church of the tenth century were found. These contained three torsos, one of Athena, and two male statues. The statues are very highly polished. The clearing of the area in the south central section of the Agora was continued, west of the mediaeval church found in the spring of 1936. A narrow marble staircase and an open-air ' waiting-room ' were discovered, corresponding to a similar construction previously laid bare on the east. The Roman foundation discovered last year under the church now turns out to be a Bema, and not a Propylaion, as was previously conjectured. It stands on the level of the southern and higher portion of the market, and was approached from the south. Broneer conjectures that this Bema was the scene of St. Paul's arraignment before Gallio. A small cemetery, containing several graves of the late eighth century and others extending down to the middle of the sixth century, was found to the west of the Bema. Some of the graves had been rifled, but several were undisturbed. There are two instances of a pair of graves lying at right angles to each other, and connected by a shelf cut through the dividing partition. One of these pairs was undisturbed. One grave contained the skeleton of a man, a Geometric skyphos, and an iron knife with a wooden handle. The other, the grave of a woman, produced two heavy gold earrings, of spiral design, and five rings, one gold, three of gold alloy, and one of silver, all on the right hand. At the feet were two iron pins with ivory heads: and in the shelf, two large bronze spits measuring about sixty centimetres. Another eighth-century grave contained a number of large vases, including a krater on a high stand. A curious shrine was excavated to the south of these graves. It is a small rectangular chamber, cut out of the rock, and contains an altar, and a niche with a base, possibly of a cult statue. In front of the shrine was a prostyle of four columns which sprang from square shafts sunk considerably below the floor level. Pottery from wells in this area ranges from the transitional period between Protocorinthian and Corinthian to the early fourth century. The most interesting discovery occurred in the north central portion of the Agora, where a large area was excavated. Here were found the</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 127 starting lines of two race-tracks, one dating from the fourth century, and the other from Hellenistic times. The latter is well preserved. It contains places for sixteen competitors, but the cuttings for their feet consist, not of two shallow continuous grooves, as elsewhere, but of separate pairs of holes for each runner, the two holes being more than half a metre apart. In the remains of the earlier, fourth-century, starting-place, the distance is greater still. The Swedish excavations at Berbati (Prosymna) were continued under the direction of Persson during the summer of 1937. Akerstr6m carried on the examination of the Mycenaean settlement on the eastern slope of the acropolis, with the object of obtaining a clearer idea of the LH III house- complex, which was grouped round a central yard, and included a potter's kiln. Many interesting misfired vases were found here. Saiflund excavated a portion of the south slope, and found well-preserved rectangular house foundations, dating chiefly from the Early Helladic period, and from a period that may be termed transitional between Early and Middle Helladic. Among the EH foundations was a house in antis of the megaron type, with a central round terracotta hearth, intact and connected with an ash-pit. The stratification and the pottery indicate an uninterrupted development from Early Helladic to early Middle Helladic. The settlement was destroyed by fire before the appearance of matt-painted ware, but after the introduction of the earlier class of grey Minyan ware. At Dendra Persson cleared a well-preserved rock-cut chamber tomb. This had two rectangular chambers, the secondary one opening on the right of the main chamber, at a right angle to the dromos. Both chambers had a shallow gabled roof. The tomb had been plundered, but two apparently undisturbed pits in the main chamber yielded good specimens of LH I-II, inconspicuous small finds (seals and glass beads) and bones, including a well-preserved skull. At Asea, southwest of Tripolis, Holmberg has found an unbroken succession of settlements from neolithic, Early Helladic and Middle Helladic times. The EH and MH pottery for the most part resembles the ordinary Argolid ware of these periods. The MH however, includes a ware with incised patterns, which probably comes from Messenia. One piece of the same kind has been found in Gonia (Blegen, Gonia, fig. 27). The site seems to have been deserted from the end of the Middle Helladic period until the middle of the 6th century B.c., when a town was built, with a temple on the highest point. Orlandos has continued his investigation of the gymnasium at Sikyon. He has found that the southern side of the lower terrace was closed, and that there were chambers opening off the stoa corresponding to those on the northern side. A small drainage channel ran along the stylobate towards the west of the peristyle and received the drainage water from the upper terrace also. A straight covered stairway of twenty steps, I135 metres broad, was also found with traces of stucco on its walls. On the upper terrace the whole of the outer wall of the gymnasium on the south and west was uncovered. This terrace consisted of a row of low buildings arranged on three sides of a rectangle.</page><page sequence="10">128 GERARD M. YOUNG Some graves were opened near the neighbouring village of Mulki. They contained some red-figure aryballoid lekythoi of the fourth century. The most important finds came from chance-opened graves at Tragana, in the region of the site of ancient Sikyon. These produced some fifth-century vases and a very fine bronze mirror dating from about 460. The handle consists of a standing kore in a Doric peplos and chiton, gathering a fold of her chiton in her left hand and holding out a flower in FIG. 2.-OLYMPIA: THE RAVINE. her right. Above the figure are two erotes, with hare and hounds along the rim. Kyparissis has excavated some late Mycenaean rock tombs of the prehistoric settlement of Antheia, south-east of Patras. One unrifled grave produced fifty-five vases of various shapes, almost all of them complete. The finds have been placed in the museum at Patras. The German Archaeological Institute carried out excavations at Olympia in the autumn of 1936 and the spring of 1937. An area north of the gymnasium, towards the left bank of the Kladeos, was examined, as were also the spaces between the treasuries along the northern edge of the</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 129 temenos east of the Heraion. These excavations were relatively unpro- ductive: but an investigation of the area farther east, on the slope of the Kronion hill north-west of the Stadion, has yielded a veritable hoard of bronzes of the sixth and fifth centuries. The storm-water from this slope of the Kronion hill now collects in a large hollow alongside the modern road, above and eastwards of the site of the excavations, and is drained off from there. In very early times it must have flowed through the site. The excavators came upon a ravine (Fig. 2), through which the torrent once flowed. At the bottom they found prehistoric sherds and obsidian blades. Above was a stratum of sand which contained nothing. At this level the torrent widened out considerably; and immediately above the barren stratum lies the historical site, on the flanks of a large hollow. There is no Mycenaean level. The historical site contains the remains of ten kilns, with bronze and iron FIG. 3.-OLYMPIA: BRONZE HORSE OF THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD. objects piled around them. They fall roughly into two groups; the older belongs to the sixth century, and the later to the first half of the fifth century. The discovery confirms the fact, already conjectured from vase- paintings, and illustrated by recent data from the American excavations in Athens, that the Greeks of this period had no standing foundries, but constructed temporary foundries as occasion required, with whatever material was available. This particular site was selected because the stratum of sand provided a fire-proof bed for the moulds. The finds consist mainly of votives-weapons, tripods, cauldrons, dedications of victors, etc., which have been cleared away from sanctuaries. The iron weapons include 200 spear-heads and many sword-blades. There are twenty-two bronze helmets, and a mass of bronze parts of shields. The latter establish two important features of shield construction. Several strips of bronze reliefs of the style known as ' Argive-Corinthian,' with vertically arranged scenes, were discovered, two of them attached to an arm-loop, which is preserved intact. This shows that these strips ran vertically down the inside of the shield from the upper rim to the arm-</page><page sequence="12">130 GERARD M. YOUNG loop, and from the arm-loop to the lower rim. The wooden surface of the shield was in most instances not entirely overlaid with bronze, but carried a band of bronze round the edge, and a crest, in the form of a bronze plaque, fastened with nails into the wood. Two outstanding examples of these crests are a large cock, and a magnificent gorgoneion, with three whirligig wings. The finest of the numerous other bronze reliefs, which are unusually well preserved, and some of which may be architectural, are a seventh-century representation of Kaineus and two centaurs, and a very large cut-out female griffin, suckling her young. This piece was attached by nails to a wooden background. The statuettes include a very fine little Geometric horse (Fig. 3), an old man, and a starting runner. Another interesting find is a standing long-jump weight of stone, with a dedicatory inscription by Akmatidas, a Lacedaemonian, winner of the Pentathlon. Some terracotta sima fragments were also found, and a painted terra- cotta female head, about one-third life-size, with an astonishing vivacity of expression. The head has a marked inclination to one side, and might belong to a sphinx-acroterion. IONIAN ISLANDS Miss Benton excavated for six weeks in north Ithaca. Three sites were examined, Stavros, Tris Langadas and H. Athanasios. In Stavros Hellenic tombs had disturbed prehistoric settlements. Several of the tombs were themselves undisturbed and give grave groups of the fourth and third centuries B.c. The finds include about a dozen small vases, some cook- ing-pots, four bronze chalices and a mirror. There are traces of two prehistoric settlements of different periods; some Mycenaean pottery occurred with the later settlement. At Tris Langadas, on the slope above the north corner of Polis Bay, a Mycenaean site was discovered. The area covered is 20 x 5 metres. A road leads up to a ruined building; both are constructed of large stones. A considerable quantity of Mycenaean pottery was found. It is in bad condition, but earlier in date and of better quality than any Mycenaean pottery yet obtained in the island (Fig. 4). It is hoped to continue excavations on this site next year. The object of the excavation at Hagios Athanasios was to examine and date the building mentioned by Vollgraff in BCH 1905, 153 ff., over part of which the present church is built. A second rock-cut staircase was found, which passed through the perimeter wall on the edge of the cliff and led up to the building. Two rock-cut basins were found on the north side. The greater part of the pottery connected with the building belongs to the third and second centuries B.C. On the west the building impinges on an earlier rock-cut chamber in which an askos was found in the form of a negro's head (Fig. 5). The chamber dates back to the fourth century, and there is no evidence of any occupation of the site before then. CENTRAL GREECE At Delphi the French School continued, under the supervision of G. Daux, the work of repairing the damage caused by the torrential flood of</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 131 December 1935. The bases of the tripod of Plataea, the chariot of the Rhodians, and the statues of the kings of Pergamon were cleared of debris. The upper part of the Sanctuary, the surroundings of the Treasury of Cyrene, and the damaged portion of the polygonal wall at its eastern end are being taken in hand this year. The Museum is being enlarged and its contents rearranged under the direction of P. de la Coste-Messelire. The charioteer now occupies a new and well-lit room to himself at the south end of the building, the sculptures will be displayed in more spacious surroundings, and the pottery and small bronzes re-grouped and classified. FIG. 4.-ITHACA: MYCENAEAN KRATER FROM TRIS LANGADAS. FIG. 5.-ITHACA, HAGIOS ATHENASIOS: PLASTIC VASE. Jannoray has continued his excavations in the Gymnasion. On the lower terrace, the western chambers of the Palaistra have been located, and beneath them the ruins, much disturbed, of earlier buildings, possibly contemporary with those destroyed to make room for the archaic temple of Athena Pronaia close by. Protocorinthian sherds were found in associa- tion with them. Farther north, on the same terrace, were found the hypocausts of Roman baths. The western end of the upper terrace was found to have rested on a supporting wall. On this terrace, also, the existence of a building and supporting walls anterior to the Gymnasion was established. The building seems to have been disturbed by an extension of the Xystos towards the south in Roman times.</page><page sequence="14">132 GERARD M. YOUNG A study of the architectural fragments of the Gymnasion has led to the identification of various parts of the stylobate, columns, and entablature of blue limestone on the lower terrace. In the Loutron it is possible to re- construct the system of water-supply, which came through a series of pipes in the wall. Beneath these pipes were pierced pillars, down which the water ran into the bath-troughs below. On the upper terrace were found parts of the Ionic columns of grey marble which rested on the bases disclosed by earlier excavations. The wide intercolumniation, and the absence of any remains of the entablature, lead to the supposition that the latter was of wood. In late Roman times the Ionic colonnade was replaced by a Doric colonnade of plastered limestone. Among the fragments of this later colonnade was a cornice block, on which traces of polychrome decora- tion were to be seen at the time of discovery. A general plan of the Gym- nasion, with detail drawings, has been prepared for publication. Krisa. Jannoray and van Effenterre continued the excavations begun in 1935 on St. George's hill. The area examined lies between the church and the ancient cyclopean wall. Here were found traces of prehistoric settlements, ranging from Middle Helladic to Mycenaean, immediately beneath the remains of a Byzantine village. The main excavation took place in the area directly below the church, and was carried to a considerable depth. The lower, Middle Helladic, stratum produced a complex of houses and graves, including also an apsidal store-chamber, in which seven well-preserved pithoi were found in place. A water-channel of this epoch was found below the Mycenaean buildings. The Middle Helladic graves were cists, lined with slabs of limestone or poros. Several were still intact. Some of the adult graves contained matt-painted ware. The Mycenaean settlement was built on the ruins of the Middle Helladic. It consists of rectangular dwellings, lying along a street, the paving of which is partly preserved. One building was a Megaron: its hearth was preserved and was full of ashes. This settlement appears to have lasted until the end of the Mycenaean age. A considerable quantity of pottery was found with these buildings: more than fifty vases have been put together. The MH vases include blue and yellow ' Minyan,' and some fine matt polychrome sherds with geo- metric designs. LH I and II pottery was found in abundance. The clay is of fine quality, rather soapy in texture. The vases are of excellent manu- facture, but the decoration is monotonous, consisting for the most part of three parallel lines, from which flame designs spread over the vases. Some sherds of Ephyraean ware were found. LH III is also well repre- sented. There was no trace of occupation of the site between the late Mycenaean and Byzantine epochs. The Krisa of the classical age must have lain elsewhere. A brief excavation on the neighbouring site of Kirrha produced a fine limestone Doric capital, and a pit filled with small skyphoi and archaic terracottas. This site will be further investigated. At Yea Anchialos Soteriou has completed his excavation of the fourth basilica (Fig. 6; see JHS Ivi, I47). He has uncovered the atrium and the mosaic floors in chambers lying on either side of the narthex. The</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 133 patterns consist of birds, beasts, fishes and vases (Fig. 7). The mosaics and the architectural and sculptural ornaments of the fourth basilica are inferior in technique to the other basilicas of Nea Anchialos, which date FIG. 6.-NEA ANCHIALOS: THE FOURTH BASILICA. FIG. 7.-NEA ANCHIALOS: MOSAIC. from the fifth and sixth centuries. Soteriou proposes to assign the fourth basilica to the early part or middle of the seventh century. MACEDONIA Kotzias has continued his excavation of the prehistoric site at Mesi- merion in Chalkidiki, and has opened up a toumba lying towards the north- east. From the evidence obtained it appears that the site served first as a</page><page sequence="16">134 GERARD M. YOUNG cemetery: it was later occupied by a fishermen's settlement, and during the third period it was again used as a cemetery. The latest occupation consisted of clay houses built upon stone foundations. Similar houses have been found at Olynthos. The finds suggest a connexion with the Early Thessalian rather than the Macedonian Bronze Age. Bakalakis has published, in Ephemeris 1936, a comprehensive survey of his excavations at Neapolis (Kavalla). Coufry, Lemerle and Roger carried out excavations at Philippi, with the assistance of M. Ducoux, the architect. The Macedonian city and Acropolis walls were traced, and found to lie almost everywhere along the line of the Byzantine walls of the tenth century. A fortified gateway was discovered on the west side of the city, corresponding to the eastern, or Neapolis, gate. These were the two main gateways of the city, through which the Via Egnatia passed. Excavations on the terrace overlooking the forum threw fresh light upon the great basilica and other Christian buildings of the late fourth and early fifth centuries A.D. Inscriptions of the late fourth and third centuries B.C. were found on stones built into the walls of the basilica. AEGEAN ISLANDS Della Seta and his colleagues continued the excavation of the pre- historic fortified settlement of Poliochni in Lemnos in the autumn of 1936. In the southern sector a long stretch of the city wall was uncovered. The wall is well preserved, and at this point rises to a height of more than four metres. It is built of a mixture of large blocks and flat slabs and has a slight inclination. A series of openings, either windows or loopholes, was found at about two metres' distance from the base. A later tower stood at the corner where the wall turns south-west. A few bronze objects, including a complete handle, some bone implements and several stone weapons and tools, were found in the fill together with some coarse red, brown and black pottery. Much of the black pottery was decorated with white paint. The wall cannot have served very long as a defence, for before the Early Bronze Age houses had been erected against it on rubbish-heaps which had risen to a height of 1'50 metres above the ground level. These houses were later destroyed by an earthquake. Later still the town wall was covered with an earth rampart, on which the last occupiers of the site, in the Early Bronze Age, constructed their humble dwellings. Excavations also took place on the summit of the height which rises steeply from the western sector of the wall. This point marks the western limit of the latest Early Bronze Age settlement which was built after the destruction of the earlier settlement by an earthquake. This latest settle- ment was unfortified and occupied only the top of the hill. The excavated houses are built for the most part on the foundations of older houses. A water-channel was discovered running partly above and partly below ground. The houses, like those found in the previous year, are rectangular with some irregularities and contained one or more large rooms. Houses and pottery of the later settlement both point to a certain degree of prosperity.</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 135 The pottery is found in considerable quantity and is of refined clay with a red glaze. It includes also a class of vases, of fine pale clay with polychrome decoration, previously found elsewhere in the Aegean, but not hitherto at Poliochni. The most important find in this sector was a deposit of about twenty weapons and tools of bronze, including spearheads, sword-blades, daggers, axes and knives. These were found in a house which had collapsed in the earthquake which destroyed the settlement. The date of the settlement lies between 1500 and 1000 B.c. The southern half of the great cistern measuring 20 x 6 metres was also excavated. The northern part had already been cleared down to the rock in 1934- In Thasos Launay completed the excavation of the Herakleion which had been carried on in 1934 and 1935. The southernextremity of the great stoa was cleared. Among individual finds were a terracotta antefix with heraldically posed rams, and an inscription, which Launay dates at the close of the fourth century, concerning the sanctuary of the Herakleion. In Delos Coufry has completed the excavation of the house on the south- west slope of Mt. Kynthos, and found a second entrance, and a spacious latrine. Roger has discovered the remains of houses and a large pavement opposite the Dioscourion, on the great Rheumatari. Young and Brock continued their excavations in Siphnos for a period of just over six weeks. Some new areas were explored, for the most part without interesting results. One Roman grave was found close to the group of first-century A.D. Roman graves excavated in 1935. It produced a silver ring and a fragmentary glass vase. On the north-east slope of the Kastro a seventh-century house was excavated: the ground plan is almost complete and the walls are better preserved than those found in 1936. The site of an archaic necropolis was found close to the road leading to Apollonia. It extended to a great depth, but unfortunately the whole area had been completely disturbed and the only finds were a few interesting sherds. The last fortnight was spent in excavating the area at the north-east end of the Acropolis, which, by then, had been cleared of most of the mediaeval and later debris. On the sea side the rock was reached almost immediately; but a fine stretch of the (probably) late sixth-century marble wall that surrounded the acropolis was disclosed. On the inner side, where the rock fell away, a series of mediaeval cisterns seemed to preclude the possibility of earlier finds. During the last week, however, an undisturbed votive deposit came to light, associated with some early foundations which have in part escaped the mediaeval builders. One building has a rectangular end and a stone base, probably for a wooden column. It is uncertain whether this was a temple, but further excavation may provide more evidence. The richest part of the deposit dates from the first half of the seventh century, but the whole deposit, which was unstratified, covers the period from 700-550. The finds include ivory fibulae, beads and other objects, an ivory seal representing a centaur with a branch; a good terracotta JHS-VOL. LVII. L</page><page sequence="18">136 GERARD M. YOUNG head; an alabaster ring with a seated male figure engraved on the bezel (Fig. 9); bronze fibulae; and a quantity of pottery, including some fragments of a very fine Late Protocorinthian oinochoe and two interesting anthropomorphic vases, of which unfortunately only the lower parts are preserved. One of these is decorated in Naxian, the other in ' Siphnian' style. FIG. 8.-SIPHNOS: ARCHAIC FITHOS-FRAGMENT. FIG. 9.-SIPHNOS: ALABASTER RING (actual size on left). The opportunity was taken to extract, under the supervision of the Greek archaeological authorities, an archaic marble head, either of a kouros or of a sphinx, from the wall of a private house into which it had been built. This fragment (total length 29 cm.) is much weathered and thickly covered with whitewash on the exposed front surfaces. It has also been marked in places with a black pigment. Two holes have been drilled into it, one in the crown, and the other in the broken surface of the neck undernearth. Adjoining the latter are the remains of cement con-</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 137 taining red particles, apparently of brick-dust. These holes and the cement suggest that the head was set up again in later times. Buschor and Schleif excavated at the Heraion in Samos, to the south and north of the Great Altar. On the south side, between the altar and the sea, the bed of the stream, which carved its way through this area about the middle of the seventh century, yielded a mass of local pottery, with some Protocorinthian, and some good votives. The date of the 'ship' (JHS Iv, I63), which stood on the way from the altar court to the bathing-place, is now thought to be about the end of the seventh century. On the north side the examination of the region between the peripteros (AM 55, 1930, 43) and the temenos boundary was completed. The excavation has thrown much light on the history of the occupation of this area, from the archaic to the Byzantine age. It has also produced a quantity of inscriptions, votive bases, architectural and sculptural frag- ments. These last include further pieces of two archaic East Greek statues, the smaller colossos, and the veiled kore with bird (Buschor, Altsamische Standbilder, fig. 124). The excavations are being continued at the time of writing. CRETE Knossos. The Curator obtained permission from the Government to sink trial pits in the space between the entrance to the Palace site and the Herakleion-Arkhanes road, where it had been proposed to lay out a car park. The area turned out to be mainly, if not entirely, covered by Minoan paving, similar to that of the West Court of the Palace of Minos, and crossed by three processional ways of poros paving-slabs, one running roughly parallel to the modern road, a second running in a west-east direction towards the ramp that leads into the West Court, and the third leading towards the South House and the Stepped Portico. The paving rests on an Early Minoan stratum, and appears to be contemporary with the earliest Palace. Foundations of the Protogeometric and Roman periods were found above it. In order to leave this area free for future excavation, the British School have proposed, and the authorities have agreed, that the proposed car park should be constructed on another site. A trial pit sunk east of the guardian's house, in the hope of finding a continuation of the west-east paved way, produced a deep deposit of sub- Minoan and Protogeometric pottery. A small excavation was conducted between February 22nd and March 15th, under the direction of Dunbabin and Hutchinson, in the area which produced the terracotta head (JHS 1936, p. 151, Fig. 9). The hope of finding an archaic deposit was not fulfilled. A Late Minoan wall was uncovered, running irregularly east and west up the hill. To the east the Minoan wall served as foundation for a Protogeometric wall. A Geometric wall following roughly the same direction also used as foundation two slightly divergent courses, apparently Minoan. These walls were probably enclosure walls. To the north a MM III wall, destroyed before the LM III period, underlies a wall, probably archaic, which had fallen before the early fourth century B.c., and has late red-figure and Hellenistic sherds stratified above</page><page sequence="20">138 GERARD M. YOUNG it. The whole area was much disturbed by Roman works, streets, drains and houses. The most interesting material is the Protogeometric, of which there is a stratified deposit reaching down into sub-Minoan. To the north- west of this area is a Late Minoan complex, as yet only partly explored, with well-built walls probably of a house. This is near the surface and not disturbed by later buildings. On the slopes above the Villa Ariadne were found remains of the fire chambers of two potters' kilns. The first, nearly round, has a doorway which faces down the slope and two short inside walls, in a line with the sides of the doorway; these must have supported the upper floor. The sides of the kiln were partly cut out in the hillside and partly built of stones, and were lined with a coating of mud which has fired hard; the floor was of stamped earth. Above the floor was a layer of burnt earth FIG. Io.-KNossos: GROUP OF WASTER VASES, FROM THE KILN. in which were many small pieces of fired clay, which must be from the upper floor. On the top of the burnt earth were a quantity of unglazed lekythoi, a few small cups, and a large group of miniature dark-glazed olpai (Fig. Io). The majority of these pots were wasters which seem to have fallen through the upper floor into the fire. Their shape and the fragments of Attic and local sherds which were found in and round the kiln suggest that they are fourth-century. Close to the kiln is a deep, roughly cone-shaped cistern cut out in the ground and lined with cement. At the bottom were found fragments of several earthenware buckets, and above a quantity of probably second-century plain glazed pottery. Overlapping the cistern and the first kiln is the floor of an oval kiln with one central support. Its walls were also lined with baked mud. It contained no pottery, but, as it cannot have been made until after the cistern was filled, there must have been a potters' quarter here for a con- siderable time. At Amnisos Marinatos continued his investigation of the Greek temple</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 139 which overlay a Minoan building, and found some further inscriptions giving the names of K6oapol. A more interesting find was a poros head of poor workmanship, which originally had inset eyes of bone. Several specimens of such eyes were discovered in the archaic burnt stratum, and one of them fits this head. In April 1937 Marinatos conducted an excavation in a cave near Phaneromeni. The cave lies on a steep slope among the foothills of Lasithi. A chamber in the fore-part of the cave contained some tables for offerings, pottery, bronze statuettes of worshippers, and a gold double axe. These objects date from the Minoan period: none of them is earlier than LM I. The cave, however, continued in use until Roman times, and yielded Geometric bronze statuettes and Geometric and orientalizing pottery, as well as Hellenistic and Roman pottery and lamps. From Argyropolis, the ancient Lappa, comes a statuette (ca. .15 m.) FIG. I I.-SITEIA: GREEN SCHIST PYXIS. in good preservation, of a woman in a peplos and head-dress, holding an apple in her extended right hand, dated by Marinatos about 480 B.C. The most important chance find brought to the Museum during the year was a Minoan inscription, engraved upon a rough stone block, the upper surface of which is hollowed out. The inscription consists of sixteen hieroglyphic symbols, very well formed and cut deep into the stone, and is the first Minoan inscription of the kind to be discovered. Fifteen of the hieroglyphics are either identical with or similar to ones already known. One appears to be new. The stone was found in a field near the palace of Malia. Another interesting object, from Siteia, is a green schist pyxis, with lid, of the Early Minoan period, decorated with running spirals, incised lines and other motives (Fig. i ). It is the first object of the kind to be found in Crete. It recalls, and is clearly influenced by, the marble pyxides from the Cycladic islands. The well-known collection of Dr. S. Giamalakis has been recently catalogued in conformity with a new enactment. The exact provenience</page><page sequence="22">140 GERARD M. YOUNG of many of the objects in the collection is not known, but they are all from Crete. They include Minoan and Greek vases, two fine bronzes (an askos, and an early fifth-century jug), several terracottas, and pithos relief fragments, coins, stone seals and rings, and a few sculptures, among them the torso of a copy of the Hermes of Praxiteles. At Mallia Chapouthier, continuing his exploration of the Palace, found under the floor of the second Palace a stucco floor in excellent con- dition. Two fine bronze swords, of a type closely resembling that from Arkalochori, were found on this floor. One of them has a hilt of bone with a gold figure of an acrobat. The handle is being reconstructed in the National Museum. At Dreros Demargne and van Effenterre explored the surroundings of the archaic temple excavated by Marinatos in 1935 (BCH 1936, pp. 214 ff.). In clearing the large cistern (I2-8 x 5'4 x 6 metres) several fragments of inscriptions were found. Three of these seem to belong to the inscription which commemorated the building of the cistern. A reference in the inscription to the Delphinian Apollo confirms Marinatos' identification of the adjacent temple. The cistern itself dates from the end of the third century B.C. Pendlebury, assisted by Miss Money-Coutts and Miss Pascoe, conducted further excavations at Tzermiadha in East Crete. He reports as follows:- 'The first site to be examined was the Kastellos, of which a survey was made. A number of tests were sunk and a good deal of information was acquired. Most important, perhaps, was the discovery of two Neolithic burials, the first which have yet come to light in Crete. They are, as might have been expected, in rock shelters, and the grave itself was filled in with small stones. The excavation of a small cave at Skaphidia north of the village confirmed this. Little trace of the Early Minoan settlement was found on the Kastellos. As at Knossos, it had been swept away by the more ambitious Middle Minoan buildings. Enough was left, however, to confirm the dating of the ' Trapeza-ware ' found for the first time last year. This ware begins in Neolithic times and ends in EM I. 'Two good MM houses were dug. The better preserved of the two was built in MM I, and continued into MM III, no trace of MM II being found. This is further proof that, except in the great centres, MM III follows immediately on MM I. Remains of MM III pithos burials appeared cn the east slopes. 'During the making of the new car-road a number of archaic terra- cottas had been found at Kolonna close to the village of Lago, and, Dr. Marinatos courteously extending our permit, we were enabled to clear the facades of two fine buildings between which ran the ancient cobbled road on the same lines as the modern one. One of these buildings has a curious baetylic stone immediately in front of the doorway. Together with another much-ruined house at Donadhes, on the other side of the village, they form part of the vast archaic city, bigger even than Lyttos, which covered the long hill known as the Papoura of Agios Georgios. Its ancient name is unknown, though the inhabitants speak of a coin of Akontion being</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 141 found near by. The cemetery seems to lie a little farther east, towards the fields of Kerasa, where an archaic deposit was found by a Hellenistic tomb. ' On the east shoulder of the Papoura stands a group of built tombs of the Geometric age. One of these, which have been much robbed by the peasants, was cleared, the most important find being a double axe of iron. In shape the tomb is a tholos about two metres in diameter and originally about the same in height. Unlike the normal tholos, it was not sunk FIG. I2.-KARPHI: Two CULT FIGURES. below ground, but was surrounded by a rectangular block of solid masonry to withstand the pressure of the vault. The dromos is narrow and the doorway low. To avoid undue pressure on the lintel, it appears that the masonry above has been built back in a semicircle, though, since only one course survived, it is impossible to say whether this space was arched over to form a relieving triangle in the manner of the mainland tholoi or not. 'Finally, two trials were made on the peak of Karphi, which rises some 18oo feet above Tzermiadha and 4500 above sea level. About 200 feet</page><page sequence="24">142 GERARD M. YOUNG below the summit is another group of built tombs, belonging this time to the Protogeometric period. This group seems to run roughly in a straight line, and a massive retaining wall which holds back the earth gives one to hope that further excavation may reveal an early Iron-Age Appian Way. Two of the tombs were cleared. They showed the same rectangular mass of masonry round the vault, but the lowest courses are also rectangular, the circular vault not beginning till some way up. 'On the windy saddle between the peak of Karphi and the slightly higher peak of Mikri Koprana a sanctuary of the same period was excavated. This contained cult figures which carry on the Minoan tradition of those of Gazi and Pankalokhori, linking the latter with the Geometric figures of Dreros. The figures are nine in number. Two only have as yet been sufficiently repaired to be illustrated (Fig. 12). They are nearly one metre high, and are in the traditional Minoan attitude. The crown of one of the figures at least was surmounted by birds and disks, and the most remarkable feature is the separate modelling of the lower legs and feet which appear through openings in front of the tubular skirt. 'In every period from Neolithic onwards the strongly conservative spirit of the inhabitants is apparent. The practice of incising the top of the rim of large jars has an unbroken sequence from Neolithic times until the local manufacture of pottery ceased a few years ago. In every period the pottery produced a number of strictly local shapes. It seems that Lasithi may well have been one of the last strongholds of the Minoans, as it is to-day of the old customs and habits of Crete.' CYPRUS 1 At Khirokitia, where Dikaios, on behalf of the Department of Antiquities, is continuing his investigations of the early settlement, the second season's work has more than doubled the area uncovered. The principal task has been the clearance of the circular hut foundations grouped on the slope above the imposing circular enclosure found last year (Fig. 13). They are very closely packed and more solidly built than those of the Erimi settlement, and are divided into two groups by what appears to be a continuation of the massive wall which protects the circular enclosure on the east side (JHS Ivi, 157, Fig. I7). As this year the excavation was centred in what may be regarded as the residential, as distinct from the ceremonial, part of the settlement, it produced a larger number of small finds than last year. They include flint and stone implements and stone bowls, some complete and some enriched with a type of relief decoration not previously recorded in Cyprus. No pottery has yet been found on this site except in the cultivated earth. Perhaps the most important achieve- ment of the second campaign has been the discovery of a large number of skeletons. In all remains of twenty-two have now been found on this site; unfortunately, only a small proportion of the skulls is measurable, but as these are the earliest human remains yet found in Cyprus, their study will be followed with particular interest. 1 From a report kindly supplied by Mr. A. H. S. Megaw, Director of Antiquities.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 143 Stewart, of the British School at Athens, has been excavating on behalf of a group of Museums in England and Australia in the Vounous cemetery near Bellapais, where Dikaios and Schaeffer in 1932 and 1933 excavated some of the finest Early Bronze Age pottery yet found in Cyprus. The forty-five tombs excavated near the eastern limit of the cemetery are re- markable in that they differ from those previously opened both in con- taining for the most part only single burials and in producing new types of pottery. The predominating stumped base and the decoration of several FIG. I 3.-KHIROKITIA: SUPERIMPOSED REMAINS OF CIRCULAR HUT-FOUNDATIONS. examples effected by the reservation of the natural buff surface from the characteristic red colour, normally applied uniformly to the whole vase, are the most important technical departures noted. But the excavator does not wish to enlarge on their significance until the whole material has been mended and studied. A further group of thirty-two tombs was examined by the eastern limit of the area previously excavated, their contents conforming in general to the types already recorded. At Curium the Pennsylvania Expedition has spent another active season. The greater part of the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates has been laid bare; the architectural remains, which for the most part represent reconstructions</page><page sequence="26">144 GERARD M. YOUNG of Roman date, include a large and a small temple lying north-south and approached respectively by a massive stairway and a paved street from a central place of assembly; the whole area is closed on the south by a long building of five similar cellae, each with an internal Doric colonnade. Where the excavations have been carried down to the lower levels some interesting individual finds of the archaic period were found, the most important a drinking Silen in bronze. On behalf of the same expedition, Daniel has been investigating a settlement mainly of the Late Cypriote III period to the east of Episkopi village, not far from the tombs which yielded Mycenaean pottery in such surprising quantity in the British Museum Excavations of 1895. A number of house-floors and foundations enclosed by a massive city wall have yielded finds mainly of local manufacture, including, however, two cylinder seals with oriental affinities. This material will doubtless throw additional light on the problem of Mycenaean influence in Cyprus which the excavator has recently discussed (in AJA XLI (I937), 56-83) in connexion with the tombs excavated by the ex- pedition at Kaloriziki. At Hagios Philon, the ancient Carpasia, Miss du Plat Taylor, on behalf cf the Antiquities Department, has continued the excavation of the Early Christian rcmains adjoining the ruined Byzantine Church (cf. R.D.A.C., 1935, 14 f.). Part of a large peristyle court adjoining the baptistery has been uncovered, and under the church were found the foundations of its basilican predecessor which was the central feature of the whole group. A section of the town wall was examined, and at one point a trial sinking into the Ptolemaic levels was made. TURKEY The Byzantine Institute, in close collaboration with the Turkish Government, is in its sixth season of work on the mosaics in Aghia Sophia. Whittemore and his assistants are at present working in the south gallery and in the great eastern apse. It is hoped that the apse mosaics will be unveiled in the spring of 1938. Baxter has pursued his excavations in the area of the Imperial Palace. The excavations of the University of Cincinnati at Troy were continued in 1936 and 1937, under the direction of Blegen. A report of the season's work in 1936 appears in AJA 41, I. The following account of the excavations from April to August 1937 has been kindly supplied by Blegen. 'Investigations were made at many places inside and about the citadel, and each one of the nine periods was subjected to further intensive study. During the season a great fortification wall of Troy I, hitherto unknown, was discovered and traced through almost one half of its circuit. Substantially constructed of unshaped and fairly large stones, with a sloping outer face, it still stands to a height of ca. 3'50 m. A narrow gateway, flanked by two massive projecting towers, lies almost directly beneath the gate assigned by Dorpfeld to period IIa and marked FN on his plan. Built into a low wall, or barrier, connected with the eastern tower and buried under an unmixed accumulation of debris of the First Settlement more than 3 m. deep, were found three limestone slabs,</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 145 or stelae, one of them bearing the sculptured representation of a human face carved in low relief in frontal view. The work shows a distinct feeling for style which implies a preceding period of experiment and development. The early strata of II, which were closely examined, yielded scanty informa- tion; but a floor-deposit of early IV gave a rich collection of pottery and other objects. A house of the transitional period between V and VI pre- sented an interesting plan and some good ceramic material. The excava- tion of the large ' Pillar House' of VI was completed, and its western end was found to be divided into three small rooms or compartments. At the north-western angle of the acropolis a new section of the fortification wall of VI was uncovered and followed northward and north-eastward ca. 40 m.

Good house- deposits of periods VIIa and VIIb were found, and Buckelkeramik is especially well represented, with many complete vases. A small building of Troy VIII was uncovered, and an abundant series of potsherds now illus- trates the ceramic styles and development of that period.' Miss Lamb reports as follows on the season's work at Kusura, 55 km. south of Afyon Karahissar: 'The excavations have enabled us to determine more clearly than before the ethnological character of the site, and have yielded fresh evidence concerning the architecture, pottery and other products. 'The third or latest period, which begins about 2000 B.C., with the appearance of the red-cross bowls, is now known to be Hittite in the wider sense of the word. Comparisons with the wares of the Hittite strata at</page><page sequence="28">146 ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1936-1937 Alisar and Alaca Hiiy ik yield various parallels, though the connexion with Bogazk6y is less close: evidently our site was, as the terracotta and stone objects found in 1935 and 1936 had suggested, within the sphere of Hittite influence. The town, frequently replanned and rebuilt, is con- structed partly of stone, and one remarkably high and solid wall may represent part of its fortification. 'The second period (Fig. 14), ending c. 2000 B.c., and developing gradually into the third, belongs to the Early Bronze Age. Its pottery, red or grey with elaborate plastic decoration, resembles that found in South-Western Anatolia, but also has points of contact with Thermi in Lesbos on the one hand and with Ahlatlibel, near Ankara, on the other. The houses, however, mainly of mud-brick, with square or oblong rooms, differ essentially from the long narrow west Anatolian type. Many walls survive to the height of two metres, one to 4-3 metres, indicating that the buildings to which they belong were constantly reoccupied. As this would not have been possible if many centuries had elapsed, and as the maximum depth of the second period deposits seems to be about 5-7 metres on the highest part of the settlement, we infer that this stage cannot have lasted very long. Nevertheless the town was at this stage more extensive and apparently richer than either before or afterwards. 'Preceding the second period is one represented so far only on the western part of the site. It has yielded no architectural remains, and its pottery seems to be an earlier version of the second period wares. We must attribute to it a cemetery excavated in 1936 on the hill opposite the settle- ment. 'Small finds include copper, stone and bone implements; stone and terracotta idols and seals; but written documents are absent.' GERARD M. YOUNG.
