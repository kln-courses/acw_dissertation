<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spatula à chaux / Massim lime spatulas by Harry Beran. Paris: Galerie Meyer. 2000. 70 pp., illus., map, biblio. Review by Douglas Newton Malinowski was short sighted, as the photographs he published of himself at fieldwork amply attest. He saw much; but to one aspect of the Massim he was as blind as a bat. Situated at the heart of a cul ture actively working in one of the most brilliant art traditions of the Pacific, he was impervious to it and to material culture as a whole. Although he collect ed many examples, he regarded them largely as museum fodder, and museums as mausolea. Malinowski's indifference, coupled with his vast prestige, slighted a subject which thereafter failed to receive the attention it deserved. If this seems hard on Malinowski it is a fact that, precisely because of his vast prestige, his influence set a brake on studies of the art. A revelation of the significance of Massim art — so deceptively merely decorative, in reality as profoundly complex as the art of the rest of New Guinea — has lately begun to emerge in the publi cations of (among others) Beier, Nunn, Battaglia, Scoditti, Nalubutau, and Harry Beran.1 Of all of them, Baran can most correctly be called an art his torian, because he has been the one who has most employed the formal apparatus of art history: the questions of what, who, when, where, how, and why. Baran's latest work is the catalogue of an exhibi tion of Massim lime spatulas held June - July 2000 at the Galerie Meyer in Paris. Anthony Meyer, the publisher, is particularly enthusiastic about Massim art as he tells us in his Foreword. He has collaborat ed with Harry Baran before (1987) and has produced a number of handsome catalogs of shows held in his Paris gallery. This one, with its authoritative text and spectacular photography of well-selected spatulas, is the best so far; it both shows beautiful objects in a format worthy of them and is beautiful to look at. Beran's main contribution here is a brief intro duction partly based on his previous study of Massim betel-chewing equipment (1988), to which this is in a way a supplement or rather an extension. He discusses the role of spatulas in Massim daily life and symbolic thought; the typology of the spatulas and variations in local styles, about which he points out there is much work to be done (and we hope he will do it). He also points out the need of, and n8 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="2">includes the history of the piece when it is known. opportunities for, the identification of individual carvers; a field which he has himself pioneered to considerable effect in his studies of Mutuaga and other Massim artists. Beran has estimated that thousands of spatulas are extant in at least 45 types not to mention many other individual examples which cannot eas ily or at all be fitted into the types. The high figure is not really surprising, because the area seems always to have had a high population (around 75,000), of whom obviously a large proportion were betel chewing men, and every man would have needed at least one spatula at any given time. Besides this, what has evidently been a considerable factor in the pro duction of spatulas is their small size and portabili ty, which always has been attractive to collectors. They were common in the European market by the 1880s and 1890s, for instance. The remarkable thing about the spatulas is the high level of their carving, which they share with Massim work as a whole. Their small scale operates in their favor: the majority are truly exquisite little objects. Relatively few are crude, or even simple. — which may stimulate an interesting question: were they really always so, or is the sample skewed by the choices of collectors? In any case there was clearly an elevated level of technical skill and esthetic sensibil ity at work among their makers. It was also quite long lasting: though Otto Finsch was complaining in the 1880s that old' work was hard to find, objects collected much later — some no doubt also by the makers of'old' objects — and indeed into the pre sent day, show no falling off of talent. The meat of this book is its photographs, which illustrate in color 65 wood spatulas, and 9 in turtle shell, which were in the exhibition. Many of them are shown at nearly actual size, which makes for bril liant clarity of the complicated details. By no means are all the types represented, but Baran divides the wooden spatulas into his already-established groups: 'Anthropomorphic spatulas' (29 examples — and one a Mutuaga, no less); 'Spatulas with animal motifs' (16 examples); 'Spatulas with plant motifs' (2 examples); 'Spatulas with canoe motifs' (9 exam ples); and 'Spatulas with non-representational han dles or handles with unidentified motifs' (9 exam ples). Beran also provides a valuable descriptive entry on each that identifies motifs and their signif icance, use, and possible authorship and dates, and There is no doubt that the art of the Massim pre sents a number of problems when we look at it as a part of the general scene of New Guinea art. The famous canoe carvings are certainly in a continuum of Austronesian forms that extends from Indonesia into Polynesia. But in its details Massim art is not really like anything we find on the mainland or, if it comes to that, towards the east. It shares some of its design vocabulary with other styles in New Guinea, but also has some of its own, and its own set of rules. It is also not as well known as might be thought. The canoe carvings, shields, spatulas and dance accouter ments are familiar enough; but there are many other less-known types as well that deserve investigation. Malinowskis battles to reform anthropology were won long ago. Studies of material culture and museum collections are now firmly reestablished as valuable, and Oceanic art is being celebrated in a series of regional exhibitions, with more to come. It is surely high time for Massim art's turn: we need it to be the subject of a definitive exhibition, as it has never been so far. At this point, even Malinowskis spirit might concur.
