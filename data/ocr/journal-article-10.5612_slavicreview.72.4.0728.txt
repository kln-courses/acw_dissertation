<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s  Approach to Film Mario Slugan During a conference held two years ago at the University of Chicago, fi lm  historian Yuri Tsivian orally commented on a presentation scrutinizing the  methodology behind Slavoj Žižek’s reading of Emir Kusturica’s Underground  (1995).1 According to Tsivian, a fi lm scholar with a neoformalist background,  one should not be overly concerned with the work of a cultural critic who  writes about fi lm merely to advance preestablished social, political, or ide- ological theses.2 Such work oft en proves methodologically suspect and be- comes relevant only as a part of a larger corpus in the study of the reception  of given fi lms. In Tsivian’s mind, then, Žižek’s work on fi lm warrants little or  no scrutiny. Were Žižek only a cultural critic with no interest in fi lm theory,  and, more important, had his work no currency among fi lm scholars, I would  certainly follow Tsivian’s suit. In truth, neither condition holds. The fact that  scholars such as David Bordwell have felt compelled to tackle Žižek’s writing  is a clear proof that Theory, with psychoanalysis at its forefront, still holds  great sway over the discipline.3 This article is not directed against psychoanalysis as such. Karl Popper  has already produced an infl uential criticism of it as a science based on its  failure to meet the falsifi ability criterion.4 Noël Carroll has argued that psycho- analytic theory is ill-suited for fi lm theory in general given its monolithic and  totalizing nature and its refusal to address alternative theories critically.5 Ste- phen Prince has contended that psychoanalysis fails to produce researchable  problems and objects to its preponderance over cognitivism in the theory of  fi lm spectatorship.6 Bordwell has also pointed out that the application of psy- choanalysis in fi lm criticism produces generic interpretative results and thus  1.

In this analysis, I will inspect the manner in which Žižek draws from the  philosophical tradition, scrutinize the ways he engages various theoretical  frameworks within fi lm studies (including cognitivism, enunciation, and au- teur theory), and, fi nally, focus on the key aspect of his engagement with fi lm  that brings all of these issues together—his readings of specifi c fi lms. My criti- cism will draw on those works in which Žižek discusses fi lm at length: Part 2  of Looking Awry, Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Lacan, The Art  of the Ridiculous Sublime, Enjoy Your Symptom!, and The Fright of Real Tears.9  Although a number of book-length critical introductions to Žižek exist, little  has focused specifi cally on this aspect of his work.10 Finally, the analytic tool- box developed here may serve equally well for criticism of Žižek’s other works  and themes. Whether we identify Žižek as a public intellectual or an academic insider,  he retains a ubiquitous and spectral presence within the humanities and so- 7.

My critique here is specifi cally addressed to those within aca- deme who invoke Žižek in order to give theoretical weight to their own work.  In doing so, they regularly fail (or refuse) to see the methodological pitfalls of  the authority they cite. The Rhetorics of Interpretation In spite of their varied understandings of the value of interpretative practice,  scholars as diverse as Wayne C. Booth, David Bordwell, Jonathan Culler, Co- lin Davis, Umberto Eco, Frederic Jameson, Richard Rorty, and James Stout all  recognize that novelty and force of conviction, not strict methodological rigor,  oft en provide the quickest route to fame within the academic community.11  According to Bordwell, the norms of academic criticism apropos interpreta- tive rather than theoretical work allow for: no analysis of the propositions of  the theory employed, no requirements to search for counter examples, no es- tablishment of criteria describing what does not count as proof of the theory,  and a great fl exibility in application of semantic fi elds, that is, the relations of  meaning between conceptual or linguistic units.12 Furthermore, what Bord- well fi nds to be weaknesses, proponents of overinterpretation such as Davis  identify as strengths. For Davis, interesting and innovative readings can oft en  only be accomplished by taking risks. Although it would be practically impossible to agree on criteria for de- termining what an “interesting” reading is and although such readings may  regularly prove to be methodologically lax, as described above, this does not  mean that they are free from all methodological requirements. The “lax stan- dards” would certainly be a far cry from E. D. Hirsch’s normative set of pre- scriptions laid out in Validity in Interpretation, but some minimums would still  have to apply.13 They would be even less stringent than Eco’s quasi-Popperian  criteria for distinguishing bad interpretations from good ones.14 These might  seem obvious, but for the sake of clarity let me note them here: factuality of  propositions on which interpretative inferences are made, and formal valid- ity of arguments.15 Both of these conditions apply for any texts in which the  author makes a claim to being in the right on intersubjective matters, that is,  matters to which, unlike subjective mental states, nobody, in principle, has a  11.

I am also inclined to think that the logical coherence of semantic fi elds employed  in the analysis should be a further condition. I discuss a variant of this in the following  section on the status of Žižek’s brand of Lacanian psychoanalysis. </page> <page sequence="4"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s Approach to Film 731 privileged epistemic access.16 Although the above two requirements appear  quite commonsensical, the apologists of overinterpretation do invoke three  points to defend positions that in one way or another still attempt to circum- vent them: interpretative assertions need not be supplanted with arguments;  the interpreted text has no internal coherence; and the interpreted text is only  a prompt for interpretative work. Let us tackle each of these in order. In his defense of overinterpretation, Davis claims that strong readers  make assertions that “are not subject to argument, demonstration or disproof.  We can take them or leave them.”17 This cannot be the case, however, for both  factual and institutional reasons. Factually, interpretations in general and  Žižek’s in particular regularly exhibit argumentative structures. The implicit,  if also formally invalid, argument in Žižek’s writing takes the form: if X is  an example of a theoretical proposition Z, it follows that Z holds (most oft en,  examples are from popular culture and the proposition is Lacanian). Further- more, Žižek also asserts an appeal to authority in statements such as “this is  what psycho-analysis teaches us.”18 Finally, even if Žižek’s arguments only  consisted of single propositions—that is, of a string of conclusions, as Davis  suggests is the case in Stanley Cavell—we in the academic community can  and should subject them to argument, demonstration, or disproof. Otherwise,  as Culler and even Davis himself point out, we acquiesce in the abuse of in- stitutional hierarchy. In other words, to claim that one’s statements are not  open to discussion and that they are to be accepted or discarded at leisure  is a luxury unavailable to lower-ranking members of the community and an  indulgence on behalf of high-ranking ones.19 Regarding the second objection, even if we accept the pragmatist view  espoused by Rorty and Stout that texts have no essence, that there is no such  thing as “what the text really is about” and that the text has no internal co- herence prior to our description of it, it does not follow that there is no text to  check an interpreter’s statements against. In what follows, I will make a point  of checking Žižek’s statements against various texts for factual errors; every- body is free to do the same for him- or herself. Moreover, the discussion of the  last objection demonstrates that Žižek is no pragmatist. Turning to the last objection then, some interpretative practices foster  the development of semantic fi elds or the relations between them in new and  imaginative ways. In Eco’s vocabulary, such readings regard the text only as  the focal point of the possibilities of semiosis. Here the text really is only a  point of departure, and references to it may be as oblique, as cursory, as in- complete, as faulty, and as incoherent as the interpreter wishes. No claim to  revealing the text’s hidden meaning is made. Žižek’s interpretations cannot be  understood in these terms, however, for he frequently asserts that his reading  does reveal what the text is about. Davis produces a list of these  statements,  16. Strictly speaking, propositional factuality and argumentative validity may be  as relevant for purely intrasubjective texts (e.g., those that describe one’s own emotions  when engaging the text) as for texts that use arguments. In those cases, however, propo- sitional factuality hinges primarily on the author’s sincerity. 17. Davis, Critical Excess, 16. 18. Žižek, Enjoy Your Symptom!, 159. 19. See Culler, “In Defense of Interpretation,” 119; Davis, Critical Excess, 184. </page> <page sequence="5"> 732 Slavic Review and we might quote another example from Enjoy Your Symptom!: “This is what  is ultimately at stake in the noir universe; the failure of the paternal meta- phor . . . renders impossible a viable, temperate relation with a woman, as a  result, woman fi nds herself occupying the impossible place of the traumatic  Thing.”20 In the fi nal analysis, to use Žižek’s words, the crucial issue is whether  or not matters of interest trump the demands of argumentative validity. Of  course, the formal invalidity of an interpretative argument does not discount  the possibility that the conclusions arrived at are correct. But possibility does  not entail probability either. Moreover, as Edward R. O’Neill reminds us in  his criticism of Žižek’s Cogito and the Unconscious, we should be deeply wary  about sacrifi cing the integrity of the scholarly procedure to the novelty of the  conclusions.21 According to O’Neill, the conclusions reached in the humani- ties may be thought of as just repetitions of premises arrived at through some  rhetorical devices, primarily arguments. But even on this account, the fact  that there is a procedure the purpose of which is obviously to legitimize con- clusions suggests it is the procedures, and not the conclusion, that should  be the loci of greater scrutiny. In other words, matters of interest should not  trump those of argumentative validity if an argument is produced within the  interpretation. Even if one thinks of arguments as nothing more than rhe- torical devices that generate predetermined conclusions—as one of Žižek’s  apologists does—arguments are still regularly employed in interpretations  in order to persuade us.22 Arguments that lack propositional factuality and  formal validity are unpersuasive. Although a reading need not be interesting  and persuasive at the same time, current interpretative practitioners—Žižek  included—still fi nd it necessary to be persuasive and regularly engage argu- mentation in order to persuade. This article is an appeal to maintain the norms for evaluating academic  interpretative practice. Some like Davis might say that in strong interpreta- tions mistakes do not matter and there is no need to persuade. We could go  further and say that argumentative validity does not matter as long as we  have something interesting to say. Some interpretations will achieve the sta- tus of exemplars, while most will simply be forgotten. Ultimately, however,  this line of thought leaves us with no criteria for adjudicating between what  is interesting and what is not. In the absence of criteria for both good and  bad interpretative work, it is reasonable to assume that those in the academic  community who have already made a name for themselves would eff ectively  become arbiters on all matters of interest. Interlude, or the Curious Case of the Real in Žižek’s Writing It might appear rather strange to proceed to discuss Žižek’s work without  even addressing psychoanalysis in general and Lacanian psychoanalysis, or  20.

The apologist in question is Harpham, “Doing the Impossible,” 467–68. </page> <page sequence="6"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s Approach to Film 733 at least Žižek’s version of it, in particular. Can a proper analysis of Žižek’s  rhetoric as it pertains to his reading of fi lms be accomplished without tak- ing his most important theoretical allegiances into account? Žižek does not  disguise the fact that he oft en discusses fi lms in order to demonstrate how  a given formal procedure, fi lm, an author’s oeuvre, or even a whole mode of  production exemplifi es a particular Lacanian thesis. As he puts it in Enjoy  Your Symptom!: “Hollywood is conceived as ‘phenomenology’ of the Lacanian  Spirit.”23 As already noted, however, there is no shortage of broader, top-down  criticism of psychoanalysis in scholarly writing. That said, it is important to  keep in mind that exposing the faults in a given thesis or framework does  not imply that a fi lm (or any other cultural product for that matter) does not  subscribe to that thesis or framework. To claim that a fi lm cannot be about the  impossibility of a sexual relationship because Jacques Lacan’s thesis does not  hold is akin to claiming that a fi lm like D. W. Griffi  th’s The Birth of a Nation  (1915) does not propagate racist values because racism has been discredited  on various levels. Before proceeding to the bottom-up approach outlined in the previous  section, however, there is one top-down remark to be made about Žižek’s ver- sion of Lacanian psychoanalysis and its relation to the question of the co- herence of semantic fi elds. These relations of meaning between conceptual  or linguistic units include clusters (for example, overlapping themes), dou- blets (for example, binary oppositions), propositions (for example, Greimas’s  semiotic square), and hierarchies (for example, Symbolic/Imaginary/Real).  Bordwell has suggested that interpretative practice is valuable because it al- lows us, somewhat diff erently than theory, to “entertain, as an imaginative  possibility, the juxtaposition and development of certain semantic fi elds.”24 If  we espoused what should be an uncontroversial stance that theoretical and  interpretative work strives toward furthering our comprehension of the mat- ters it tackles, it is unclear why one would try to explain things in terms of  the Real as oft en as Žižek does.25 The reason for this unclarity lies in Žižek’s  defi nition of the Real as “that [which] resists all symbolization.”26 As such, the  Real turns out to be a variant of Immanuel Kant’s thing in itself. But, follow- ing Ludwig Wittgenstein, there is just nothing to say about it (and even to say  this is saying too much). We might ask ourselves then: what is added to our  comprehension of, among other things, montage as a formal device, the op- position between voice-over/fl ashback and subjective camera in fi lm noir, Ro- 23. Žižek, Enjoy Your Symptom!, xi. Another example of the same attitude: “It [this  book] mercilessly exploits popular culture, using it as convenient material to explain  not only the vague outlines of the Lacanian theoretical edifi ce but sometimes also the  fi ner details missed by the predominantly academic reception of Lacan.” Žižek, Looking  Awry, vii. 24. Bordwell, Making Meaning, 263. 25. Some have even suggested that all of Žižek’s work may be thought of as “think- ing, writing and reading about the Real.” Sarah Kay, Slavoj Žižek: A Critical Introduction  (Oxford, 2003), 1. 26.

Even in his later distinctions between symbolic Real, imaginary  Real, and the real Real, the last again conforms fully to the above defi nition. </page> <page sequence="7"> 734 Slavic Review berto Rossellini’s fi lms, David Lynch’s universe, Krzysztof Kieślowski’s opus,  Alfred Hitchcock’s fi lms ranging from The 39 Steps (1935) to The Birds (1963),  or the whole of the fi lm noir universe if we describe them in terms of a seman- tic fi eld defi ned in advance as inaccessible to language—that is, the Real?27  Consider Žižek’s thesis that “a key constituent of Lynch’s universe [is] the Real  of an excessive life-intensity threatening to explode the framework of reality,”  or the claim that what montage produces is “a surplus that is radically hetero- geneous to cinematic reality but nonetheless implied by it . . . [the] surplus of  the real . . . the gaze qua object.”28 How is this any diff erent from explaining  these fi lms or formal devices in terms of X without providing the content of X  or, even worst, producing content for it despite the explicit constraint that no  content can be produced?29 Because of this, we should think of the conceptual  coherence of semantic fi elds employed as an additional criterion for evalu- ating interpretative work next to propositional factuality and argumentative  validity. Of course, as Žižek would later suggest, the Real might not resist all  symbolization aft er all.30 Then, however, we are dealing with something with  far less theoretical weight. Rhetorics Proper It is not only his detractors but Žižek himself who points out that what he says  and writes should not always be taken seriously. Bordwell addresses the case  in point in Fright of Real Tears.31 There, in an anecdotal recollection, Žižek ex- poses himself as a bluff er who, when asked to comment on a painting, simply  invented the concept of a frame beyond the frame which, much to his own  27.

On Rossellini: “Herein  lies also the fundamental ‘Hegelian’ lesson of Rossellini’s fi lms: the act qua real, trans- gression of a symbolic limit, does not enable us to (re)establish a kind of immediate con- tact with the presymbolic life substance, it throws us, on the contrary, back into that abyss  of the Real out of which our symbolic reality emerged.” Žižek, Enjoy Your Symptom!, 54.  Emphasis in the original. On Kieślowski’s opus, “If there ever was a fi lm-maker obsessed  with this inner tension of our experience of reality, it is Kieslowski. In what is arguably  his paradigmatic procedure (as exemplifi ed by the short post-offi  ce sequence in Decalogue  6), he elevates a common phenomenon like the glass refl ection of a human face into the  momentous apparition of the Real for which there is no place in our experience of reality.”  Žižek, Fright of Real Tears, 66. Žižek’s interpretation of Hithcock’s work in terms of the  Real will be examined later in this article.

Bordwell, “Slavoj Žižek.” </page> <page sequence="8"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s Approach to Film 735 consternation, was picked up in further discussion.32 Yet, when Žižek himself  uses this very same concept further on in Fright of Real Tears, Bordwell fails  to identify a criterion by which to judge whether this usage is also meant ironi- cally or not. Thus, according to Bordwell, the possibility is opened that indeed  every assertion of Žižek’s might be taken as a bluff . In light of the fact that Žižek is quite fond of repeating himself, however,  either by drawing on a set of ready-made examples or by copy-pasting his  own words across his works, it seems reasonable to say that there is a particu- lar set of utterances Žižek holds dear and worth repeating.33 Groucho Marx’s  (or, more precisely, Rufus T. Firefl y’s) famous line from Duck Soup (1933), is a  favorite: “Gentlemen, Chicolini here may talk like an idiot and look like an  idiot, but don’t let that fool you: he really is an idiot.”34 Similarly, Arbogast’s  murder from Psycho (1960) and the Bodega Bay aerial shot from The Birds are  perhaps his most oft en used fi lm examples.35 As far as verbatim repetitions  are concerned, compare the discussion of Charlie Chaplin’s work in Enjoy Your  Symptom! and Looking Awry; Lynch’s work in Fright of Real Tears and The Art  of the Ridiculous Sublime; the discussion of art forms crossing media boundar- ies in Fright of Real Tears and The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime; almost identi- cal periodization of Hitchcock’s oeuvre in Looking Awry and Everything You  Always Wanted to Know about Lacan; and the discussion of Andrei Tarkovskii  in Fright of Real Tears and “The Thing from Inner Space.”36 I do not put this  forward as a criticism (as some have); someone who publishes as much ought  to be allowed to “steal” from himself. On the contrary, I mention it to demon- strate a particular consistency in Žižek’s writing, which helps us ascertain  that most of the time, or at least in his most important points, he is not bluff - ing. Moreover, because these repetitions and scene analyses occur in various  contexts and serve to substantiate diff erent points, criticism of a single analy- sis proves productive far beyond the claim that it is only here and there that  Žižek’s engagement with fi lm is problematic. Furthermore, to suggest that Žižek is constantly bluffi  ng might also imply  that he is not presenting a conclusion when he frames it as a rhetorical ques- 32.

Oft en such a procedure is cued with the phrase “is it not”: “Is it not that  Shoah, this paradox of a documentary with the self-imposed limitation of not  using any documentary footage, thus enacts all the paradoxes of the icono- clastic prohibition constitutive of Judaism?”37 A similar rhetorical device em- ploys phrases such as “as it were” or “as if,” which appear again and again as  qualifi cations of his statements. The deliberately ambiguous language does  leave the door open for further (re)articulations. I would be skeptical of claims  maintaining that this is indicative of a general aversion to defi nitiveness on  Žižek’s part, however, for he does, when pressed, stand behind what he says  or at least insist that there are enough clues in his texts to discern whether a  statement was meant as a bluff , irony, or a joke.38 With this in mind, it is not  unreasonable to read Žižek’s writing at face value, even when it is supplanted  with the aforementioned rhetorical qualifi ers and even when it appears as  outlandish provocation. Žižek’s role as a provocateur might be best clarifi ed through recourse to  his favorite rhetorical device—what might be called the “structural inversion.”  The logical form of this device varies. One can identify a variety of forms be- ginning with the simple, “it is not that p, rather opposite of p.”39A more com- plex version is, “it is not that p → q, rather q → p.”40Another couple of complex  forms are, “it is not that p → q, rather opposite of q → opposite of p”; or “it is  not that p → q, rather p → opposite of q.”41 A fi nal variation is, “it is not that  p → q, rather opposite of p → q”: “So what is Véronique [from Double Life of  Véronique (1991)] retreating from when she abandons her lover? She perceives  this staging [his puppeteer show] as a domineering intrusion, while it is ac- tually the very opposite: the staging of her ultimate unbearable freedom.”42  Žižek also frequently invokes the “logic” of “fi ght fi re with fi re” in his writing:  37.

A good case in point is the episode of BBC’s HARDtalk on which he defended,  however problematically, Stalinism from liberal capitalism. 39. “Against this commonplace [Freud’s alleged “pansexualism”], one should assert  that the Freudian revolution consists in exactly the opposite gesture: . . .

An illustration of the fi rst of these would be: “In short, the problem with Kane  [in Citizen Kane (1941)] was not that for all of his adult life [as a mature subject] he was  in search of the lost incestuous object, trying to recapture it; the problem was rather the  exact opposite: he never really lost this object, he stuck to it to the end and thus remained  ‘immature.’” Žižek, Fright of Real Tears, 51.

An illustration of the  second is “Such reversals in the order of narration might be expected to provoke an eff ect  of total fatalism: everything is decided in advance, . . . it is precisely the reversal of the  temporal order that makes us experience in an almost palpable way the utter contingency  of the narrative sequence, i.e., the fact that, at every turning point, things might have  taken another direction.” Žižek, Looking Awry, 71. 42.

It is rather ironic that somebody who prefers  simple binary inversions to more nuanced accounts is regularly described as  the poststructuralist thinker par excellence. Finally, Žižek is also fond of what some would call “eclecticism” and oth- ers “name-dropping.” Invoking numerous philosophers and thinkers enables  one’s own thoughts to be reiterated and validated. Žižek regularly invokes  Lacan and Hegel; Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Kant, and Baruch Spinoza also  fare well in his writings. The problem here is not so much Žižek’s proximity to  the French academic style, oft en pilloried in the Anglo-American tradition for  its endless digressions. The problem is rather that, on occasion, Žižek simply  misunderstands what a given thinker has said. For instance, he invokes Pop- per’s Third World as an equivalent to Lacan’s the big Other by claiming that  “the Lacanian big Other, the order of symbolic fi ctions [is] what Karl Popper  called the Third World, neither that of psychological self-experience nor that  of material reality.”44 Yet, although the Third World has an ontological status  diff erent from both mental and physical phenomena, anybody familiar with  Popper’s work will know that the Third World strictly refers to entities such  as mathematical objects and not to the symbolic fi ctions, that is, “[the] un- conscious level . . . , the non-psychological symbolic order itself.”45 Similarly,  Žižek misconstrues John Searle’s concept of declarative performatives: “one  closes the meeting by stating that it is closed, i.e., one pretends to describe  an already-given state of things [‘The meeting is closed’]—in order to be ef- fective, the ‘pure’ performative (the speech act which brings about its own  propositional content) has to endure an inner split and assume the form of  its opposite, of a constative.”46 But no such inner split is necessary for the  speech act to bring about its propositional content for a nonconstative of the  following type would suffi  ce: “I pronounce the meeting closed.” While these  mistakes do not pertain to arguments made specifi cally about fi lm, they do  reveal striking unfamiliarity with some critical concepts. As such, they un- dermine the rhetorical impact of Žižek’s writing specifi cally, and his status as  a well-versed philosopher more generally. Other Theoretical Frameworks As noted earlier, psychoanalysis is not the only theoretical framework Žižek  directly engages. In Fright of Real Tears Žižek takes issue with what he calls  43.

Let us  consider these in sequence. According to Žižek, “Post-Theory insists on multiple relatively indepen- dent levels” of fi lm, such as style, narrative, and material conditions of pro- duction.49 Even when it “endeavour[s] to discern global correspondences be- tween the diff erent levels,” however, post-theory still “do[es] not yet reach the  level of Theory proper.”50 For Žižek, real theory is only attained by means of  a short-circuit when we conceive of a certain formal procedure not as expressing a certain aspect  of the (narrative) content, but as marking/signalling the part of the content  that is excluded from the explicit narrative line, so that—therein resides the  proper theoretical point—if we want to reconstruct “all” of the narrative con- tent, we must reach beyond the explicit narrative content as such, and include  some formal features which act as the stand-in for the “repressed” aspect of  the content.51 It appears then as though Žižek is setting up a demonstration of the cor- rect course of action. Yet what follows is an example from melodramas where,  as Žižek points out, “the emotional excess that cannot express itself directly  in the narrative line fi nds its outlet in the ridiculously sentimental musical ac- companiment or in other formal features.”52 If this is an example of true theo- retical work, one wonders how it is any more productive than the cognitivist  analysis of Casablanca (1942) he himself discusses later in the text.53 How  does Žižek’s example diff er from the standard neoformalist accounts of the  Hays Code he touches on in The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime, where cutting  away to the fi replace following a lovers’ embrace signals the consummation  of the relationship?54 And how does this diff er from neoformalist accounts of  simple classic Hollywood style procedures such as cuts on action that func- 47. In “Slavoj Žižek,” Bordwell takes issue with the term cognitivist being used as a  blanket term. I use the term in the remainder of the paper only because Žižek does. 48. Bordwell, Figures Traced in Light, 260–64; Bordwell, “Slavoj Žižek.” Incidentally,  although Gopalan Ravindran’s “Žižek’s The Fright of Real Tears” was initially published  in December 2005, clearly making it improbable that Ravandrian could have read Bord- well’s “Slavoj Žižek,” since the time between the publication of the two was a matter of  months, it is curious that the 2007 reprint for the International Journal of Žižek Studies  makes no reference to Bordwell’s paper, especially because it deals with most of Ravin- dran’s objections to cognitivists. 49.

The second point I wish to address is what in fi lm studies is usually re- ferred to as enunciation theory. This theory sets out to give an account of vari- ous aspects of fi lm narration and spectatorship in terms of the distinction be- tween two types of utterances—histoire and discourse—developed originally  by the French linguist Émile Benveniste.56 The distinction between the two  boils down to the absence or presence of clear markers of enunciation, that is,  the act of linguistic expression. Thus, if we can fully understand the utterance  without any knowledge about the speaker, as is the case in “Slavoj Žižek is a  Slovene,” we are dealing with histoire. On the other hand, discourse stands for  utterances such as “Yesterday I took a walk,” which cannot be fully compre- hended without knowing both the time of the enunciation (what “yesterday”  refers to) and the identity of the enunciator (who “I” refers to). Film theorists  have applied this linguistic model to fi ction fi lm in order to dispel the alleged  ideological eff ects that, according to them, are a product of mistaking fi ction  fi lm for histoire when it is in fact discourse. In narratological terms, this means  that the fi lm story does not recount itself as it is usually assumed, rather it is  presented by a fi lmic enunciator, that is, a narrator responsible for all of the  fi lm’s images and sounds. Although Bordwell has been rightly criticized for merely replacing the con- cept of the narrator with the concept of narration and for keeping much of the  narrator’s anthropomorphic properties and thus retaining a certain agency  that still enunciates its position, Carroll has more recently criticized enuncia- tion theory more successfully.57 Interestingly, Žižek behaves as though the  arguments against enunciation theories written before Fright of Real Tears,  above all Bordwell’s and Carroll’s criticisms in Narration in the Fiction Film  and Mystifying Movies, respectively, do not exist.58 Without even addressing  their arguments, he proceeds to use the concept of enunciation throughout  Fright of Real Tears as if it was entirely unproblematic. Žižek presents the logic of suture—a technical term for various procedures  informing the position of the spectator in relation to various sequences of  shots, most notably the shot/reverse-shot sequence—as a three-step process  and connects it to enunciation:59 55. A standard example is a shot of the hand on the handle followed by a shot of the  character in another room signaling the character has walked through the door. 56.

For criticism of suture, also left  unanswered by  </page> <page sequence="13"> 740 Slavic Review  Firstly, the spectator is confronted with a shot, fi nds pleasure in it in an  immediate, imaginary way, and is absorbed by it.  Then, this full immersion is undermined by the awareness of the frame  as such: what I see is only a part, and I do not master what I see. I am in a  passive position, the show is run by the Absent One (or, rather, Other) who  manipulates images behind my back.  What then follows is a complementary shot which renders the place from  which the Absent One is looking, allocating this place to its fi ctional owner,  one of the protagonists. . . .   So, in order to suture the decentring gap, the shot which I perceived as  objective is, in the next shot, reinscribed/reappropriated as the point-of-view  shot of a person within the diegetic space. . . . When the second shot replaces  the fi rst one, the “absent one” is transferred from the level of enunciation to  the level of diegetic fi ction.60 The construction of the second paragraph suggests (especially given  Žižek’s adherence to auteur theory) that the Absent One who manipulates  images behind my back is none other than the author. This is further sup- ported by the abundance of phrases such as “this long panning shot thus  directly renders Kieślowski’s fundamental notion of the ‘solidarity of sinner’”  or Hitchcock “engages us directly with the point of view of this . . . Gaze.”61  In other words, the fact that Žižek regularly and indiscriminately uses the  author-predicate constructions to talk both about fi lm’s formal procedures, ef- fects, and fi ctional aspects and about an author’s actions in actual life points  to an ontological confl ation. But this confl ation is a classical mistake that Gé- rard Genette warned against at least as early as 1972. In Figures III, partly  translated into English as Narrative Discourse, Genette made absolutely clear  that the diegetic space-time and the actual time of production of the narrative  are not to be mistaken for one another.62 Of course, it could be said that I am  reading too much into Žižek’s use of the author-predicate construction for it  can be easily understood as common shorthand for how we talk about fi lm.  Thus, when Žižek says that Hitchcock does so-and-so, he really means that  the fi lm has such-and-such an eff ect. If that is so, the alternative as far as the Absent One is concerned is that it  should be identifi ed with what has usually been referred to as le grand imagier  since Christian Metz, or as the implicit fi ctional narrator since the discussions  of its (non-)ubiquity in fi ction in analytic circles. Latter discussions have dem- onstrated, however, that such a fi gure does not exist or exists in a very limited  number of fi ction fi lms.63 In fact, its existence pivots around the continuous  Žižek, see William Rothman, “Against the System of Suture,” Film Quarterly 29, no. 1 (Fall  1975): 45–50; Bordwell, Narration in the Fiction Film, 110–13; Carroll, Mystifying Movies,  183–99. 60.

As such,  they are thought to reveal the fi ctional agency in charge of relating the infor- mation out of which the story is to be inferred. Among the examples listed,  however, only point-of-view shots suggest that there is somebody within the  diegesis who is responsible for seeing what we see on screen. And even then  it is only a character responsible for this particular vista and not a narrator  who is responsible for the whole of the fi lm, that is, the one who manipulates  images behind my back. Moreover, this list clearly only includes shots that  are not objective, because objective shots are defi ned as shots where no such  intrusive markers may be found. And, in the above cited passage on suture  Žižek claims that the objective shot exists on the level of enunciation. Thus,  when Žižek refers to a fi ctional Absent One, not only is the fi ctional Absent  One theoretically an unsustainable term, but his description of an objective  shot as expressive of enunciation is not even in line with what counts as a sign  of enunciation in standard accounts of enunciation theory. Another theoretical framework Žižek invokes is auteur theory. Among  various authors Žižek discusses, his most comprehensive analyses are of Ros- sellini in Enjoy Your Symptom!, of Hitchcock in Everything You Always Wanted  to Know about Lacan and Looking Awry, of Kieślowski in Fright of Real Tears,  and of Lynch in The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime. The methodological irregu- larities that plague Žižek’s writings generally are brought into sharp relief in  his specifi c treatment of these authors. They include assumptions about direct  translation of authorial intentions to the eff ects of their work; assumptions  about the coherence of the author’s vision over his entire oeuvre; key conclu- sions drawn from the interviews with Kieślowski rather than from the fi lms  themselves (this is where the title of Fright of Real Tears comes from); privileg- ing scripts over the fi nal versions of the fi lm; and identifying fi ctional charac- ters as the author’s alter egos (Véronique in Double Life of Véronique, the Judge  in Red [1994]).66 But it is not these standard irregularities in the application  of auteur theory on which I want to dwell.

In Looking Awry it is based on the three variations on the impossibility of sex- ual relationship, and in Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Lacan  on Jameson’s triad of realism–modernism–postmodernism. Everything You  Always Wanted to Know about Lacan expands on the thematic periodization  by providing the formal traits of each period. In fact, fi ve diff erent periods in  Hitchcock’s oeuvre are proposed in Everything You Always Wanted to Know  about Lacan, but the three that correlate with Jameson’s triad are identifi ed as  crucial in both texts, and, at least thematically, described almost identically.  “Realism,” according to Žižek, correlates with Hitchcock’s English fi lms of the  second half of the 1930s, from The 39 Steps (1935) to The Lady Vanishes (1938).  Formally they belong to the classical fi lm style, though thematically their  function is “to put the love couple to the test and thus to render possible their  fi nal reunion.”68 “Modernism” correlates with the “Selznick period”—from Re- becca (1940) to Under Capricorn (1949)—and is centered on the female heroine  caught in the triangle with “the elderly fi gure of a villain . . . and the younger  somewhat insipid ‘good guy’ whom she chooses in the end.”69 Formally, it  is characterized by “long, anamorphically distorted tracking shots.”70 “Post- modernism,” formally characterized by the problematization of enunciation  and spectatorship within diegesis, correlates with the big fi lms of the 1950s  and early 1960s. These fi lms, from Strangers on a Train (1951) to Birds (1963),  are thematically centered on “the male hero to whom the maternal super ego  blocks access to a normal sexual relationship.”71 The additional two periods  include fi lms before The 39 Steps during which Hitchcock’s classical style is  consolidated, and the fi lms from Marnie (1964) onward characterized by dis- integration and the decline in quality. The problem of this periodization is not merely one or two fi lms that some- how fall in-between periods and thus elude easy classifi cation. For instance,  Jamaica Inn (1939)—an English fi lm of the second half of the 1930s made aft er  The Lady Vanishes—does not make Žižek’s list.72 Similarly, when we move to  the divide between “modernism” and “postmodernism,” the rather (in)fa- mous Stage Fright (1950)—shot between Under Capricorn and Strangers on a  Train—is not categorized at all.73 The greatest problem is rather that the peri- odization does not hold up even for the fi lms that are named. 67. For Davis, interestingly, this is one of the moments of “patient, scholarly   coherence-building” in Žižek’s work, which stands out against more “outrageous leaps of  interpretative imagination.” Davis, Critical Excess, 128. 68.

It was not a Selznick production so it is highly unlikely it can be put under the  period correlating with modernism. On the other hand, long tracking shots do play an  important role there and the (in)famous false fl ashback may be interpreted as another way  </page> <page sequence="16"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s Approach to Film 743 Let us briefl y consider the “Modernism” or the “Selznick” period. In Re- becca the female protagonist (Mrs. de Winter) never fi nds herself in the tri- angle described by Žižek. The relationship between her, her husband Maxim,  and his deceased wife Rebecca bears no resemblance to Žižek’s triad. The  triangle described by Žižek is evident in Foreign Correspondent (1940), but the  action in fact revolves around the male protagonist—American journalist John  Jones—rather than the female one—the conspirator’s daughter Carol Fisher. In  Mr. and Mrs. Smith (1941), there is no privileging of the protagonists and the  love triangle is again not of the sort Žižek describes, but between Mrs. Smith,  her husband, and his business partner. In the case of Saboteur (1942), no love  triangle—real or imagined—exists at all and, to boot, the action centers on the  male protagonist. The absence of triangles also holds for both Lifeboat (1944),  which is better described in terms of couples connecting aft er they literally  cannot get away from each other, and Spellbound (1945).74 The Paradine Case  (1947) harbors three diff erent love triangles, but in every case the criminal is  a woman not a man. The Paradine Case is also a good example for demon- strating how poorly Žižek uses narratological terminology. He notes that the  story in this period is “narrated from the point of view of the woman,” which  means that she is a focalizer in the narratological sense of the word.75 Yet in  the fi lm Mrs. Paradine is presented as a sphinx whose motifs are unknown  and the focalizer is her attorney, Anthony Keane. Finally, in his discussion  of Under Capricorn Žižek again misreports the triangle. It is again the woman  who commits the crime for which the elderly man is accused. Žižek, however,  makes it seem as though Henrietta’s fi nal admission of guilt is a lie, whereas  it is clear from the fi lm that the lie resides in her husband’s initial admission  of guilt.76 There are also four short propaganda fi lms from this period that are regu- larly described as having no traits particular to Hitchcock whatsoever. These  are, of course, not even mentioned by Žižek. Finally, to claim that the key  formal characteristic of the “Selznick” period is its long takes is eff ectively  to postulate Rope, Under Capricorn, and perhaps The Paradine Case as the  only fi lms of the period. Out of twelve fi lms of the period (supposing we do  not even count the propaganda ones), three are representative in their formal  of diegetic problematization of fi lm spectatorship. Thematically, however, there is neither  a love triangle fi tting Žižek’s description nor a maternal superego at play here. 74. It is not impossible Žižek would claim that the triangle in Lifeboat includes a rug- ged John Kovac, the female journalist “Connie” Porter, and the scheming German captain  Willy. In Spellbound, it should not be forgotten that Dr. Constance Peterson’s true mentor  is not the evil Dr. Murchison but the good Dr. Alexander Brulov. Moreover, Spellbound,  together with Marnie, is the fi lm in which Hitchcock explicitly addresses psychoanalysis  and does so in an extremely simplistic manner. In Spellbound the key to John Ballant- yne’s mystery proves to be his dream, but the psychoanalytic reading of this is extremely  simplistic. Marnie’s kleptomania is also explained with recourse to no more developed  understanding of psychoanalysis. With Groucho Marx’s maxim in mind, it is rather curi- ous that at no point does Žižek tackle the most explicit treatments of psychoanalysis in  Hitchcock’s fi lms. 75.

A similar argument may be produced for the “Postmodernism” period.  There no maternal superego stops the male protagonist from a sexual aff air in  Dial M for Murder (1954), To Catch a Thief (1955), The Trouble with Harry (1955),  The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), or The Wrong Man (1956). Furthermore,  it is unclear why Žižek claims a maternal superego stops Bruno in Strangers on  a Train from a sexual aff air. Although there is a peculiar relationship between  him and his mother, it is his father who he feels keeps him away from leading  the life he wants. In the end, it is his father he wants to murder, not his mother.  Finally, Bruno is shown as quite capable of having amorous exploits—he ef- fectively charms his female victim into meeting him alone. As far as the other thematic trait is concerned, one could argue that nei- ther Dial M for Murder, Psycho, or The Birds centers on the male hero (Tony  Wendice, Mitch Brenner, and Norman Bates, respectively) but on the female  one (Margot Wendice, Melanie Daniels, and Marion and Lila Crane, respec- tively). Similarly, Strangers on a Train does not take Bruno (the potentially  sexually traumatized male, according to Žižek) as its focus, but rather the  wrongfully suspected Guy. Also, The Trouble with Harry is better described  as centered on two couples. Again, at least half of the twelve fi lms from the  period are not thematically representative of the period. It is even worse as  far as the formal aspect is concerned, for only Rear Window (1954), Vertigo  (1958), and Psycho diegetically problematize conditions of fi lm spectatorship.  Finally, it should not be forgotten that next to these twelve “postmodernist”  fi lms, Hitchcock directed altogether twenty episodes from diff erent television  series (seventeen of which from Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which ran from  1955 to 1961). What might strike one as odd is that somebody who pays a lot of  attention to Lynch’s Twin Peaks (1990–91) and Kieślowski’s Decalogue (1989)  does not even mention this. My intention here is not, of course, to lay down strict statistical criteria for  periodizing a director’s oeuvre. Yet when at least half the fi lms (and frequently  even more) assigned to a particular category do not fi t the mold, the model  surely lacks credibility. Žižek’s periodization of Hitchcock’s fi lms is specula- tive, at best, and specious at worst.78 His approach should fi rst and foremost  be criticized by proponents of auteur theory because it gives their (far more  nuanced) eff orts a bad name. As far as more interpretative gestures are concerned, Žižek does not miss  the opportunity to cast Hitchcock’s three periods in terms of the Lacanian  triad: Symbolic/Imaginary/Real. “Realism”: “The McGuffi  n is clearly the objet  petit a, a gap in the centre of a symbolic order—the lack, the void of the Real  setting in motion the symbolic movement of interpretation, a pure semblance  77. For one of the fi ve a rather suspicious interpretative move is made when the “pas- sive” member of the supposedly homosexual couple from Rope (1948) is identifi ed as torn  between his partner and his professor. 78. Similar problems arise in the discussion of the Colors trilogy. Žižek claims they  are centered on the female protagonist. It is true he recognizes White as a counterfactual,  but he terms it an exception. One mismatch out of three seems to me to be something more  than an exception. </page> <page sequence="18"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s Approach to Film 745 of the Mystery to be explained, interpreted . . . The fi rst period [“Realism”]  stands clearly under the sign of a, i.e. McGuffi  n.”79 “Modernism”: “This is the  basic situation in a whole series of Hitchcock’s fi lms: . . . the imaginary bal- ance changes into a symbolically structured network through a shock of the  Real.”80 “Postmodernism”: “The birds are Phi, the impassive, imaginary ob- jectifi cation of the Real . . . In the third period [“Postmodernism”] the diff erent  forms of the big Phi become predominant.”81 Thus, even if there were no other  issues, already this broad periodization drawing heavily on a conceptually  inaccessible term—the Real—would be suffi  cient to make us wonder whether  in his interpretative work Žižek brings anything of substance to the table. The Unbearable Lightness of Interpreting In this last section of methodological analysis proper, I wish to consider some  of Žižek’s readings of fi lms. The goal of this analysis is not to posit the su- periority of one interpretative framework over another but to highlight how  oft en Žižek’s readings contain theoretical misunderstandings or plain errors.  For instance, Žižek’s reading of The Double Life of Véronique fails on both ac- counts; his readings of the previously mentioned sequences from Psycho and  The Birds, “only” on the latter.82 The theoretical framework for Žižek’s interpretation of Kieślowski’s work  is Kant’s distinction between morality and ethics, that is, “[the] choice [be- tween the two that] runs through Kieślowski’s entire” work.83 Given the im- perative to preserve the theoretical coherence of Kieślowski’s opus, it is no  wonder Žižek sees a choice between morality and ethics in The Double Life  of Véronique where there is none: “This choice [is] staged at its purest in The  Double Life of Véronique—vocation (leading to death) and a quiet satisfi ed life  (when/if one compromises one’s vocation).”84 Žižek claims that Weronika is  aware of her heart condition and that “she has to choose—to continue singing,  with all the stress and strain which this involves, and risk her life or to give  79. Žižek, Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Lacan, 8. Emphasis in the  original. 80. Ibid., 7. 81. Ibid., 8. 82. Another point worth considering is the presence of factual errors in Žižek’s texts,  which, although no further interpretative claims are based on them, evidence lack of  methodological discipline. In Roberto Rossellini’s Germany Year Zero (1948) it is not the  father’s milk that is poisoned, as Žižek would have it, but the tea. See Žižek, Enjoy Your  Symptom!, 35. In Rossellini’s Stromboli (1950) Ingrid Bergman’s character is not Estonian  but Lithuanian. Ibid., 41. Where evil spirits dwell in Twin Peaks is not Red but Black Lodge.  Ibid., 163; Žižek, Fright of Real Tears, 53; Žižek, Art of the Ridiculous Sublime, 24. There are  even direct contradictions: in The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime three diff erent characters  (Mystery Man on p. 18 and both Pete and Fred on p. 20) are identifi ed as killing Mr. Eddy.  In Andrei Tarkovskii’s Stalker (1979) nobody enters the room at all, and, moreover, they do  not fail to express their wishes “because of their lack of faith” but because they know it is  not their pronounced wishes that will be realized, rather those deepest secret ones. See  Žižek, “The Thing from Inner Space.” 83. Žižek, Fright of Real Tears, 137. 84. Ibid. </page> <page sequence="19"> 746 Slavic Review up her singing career and lead a normal life.”85 In the fi lm, though, no cue is  given that Weronika knows about her illness. It is Véronique who knows of  her own condition (which can be inferred from the fact she is in possession of  her EKG), not Weronika. This clearly demonstrates that Weronika is not in a  position to make any choices, for there is no choice to make. One might object that Žižek’s interpretation is only partly invalidated— that, although it does not apply to Weronika, it still holds for Véronique. The  problem with this claim is that even Véronique fi nds out about her condition  only aft er she has made her choice not to sing again. When asked by her men- tor why she is quitting, she simply responds: “I don’t know.” Véronique’s la- conic response barely supports Žižek’s central argument that the choice be- tween singing and not singing is the one between ethics and morality. For  Kant, of course, the subject cannot make an ethical choice without knowing  she is making one.86 In order to substantiate his points about The Double Life of Véronique and  the coherence of Kieślowski’s opus, Žižek invokes Camera Buff  (1979). First, he  incorrectly states that the protagonist’s wife leaves him in the fi nal scene and  that he “turns the camera on himself and his wife, recording her departure on  fi lm.”87 On the contrary, Filip’s wife has left  him some time ago, and she does  not reappear in the fi nal scene. Žižek then claims that Filip’s fi lming of him- self at this moment “is the ultimate proof that he has truly elevated fi lming  into his ethical cause.”88 This is again factually incorrect. Filip has just had  his hopes raised that his wife has returned; he starts to fi lm only aft er discov- ering that it was the milkman who rang the bell. Filip fi lms the story of how  he lost his family and, arguably, he does it in order to somehow reclaim them.  Such a heteronomous action is certainly not ethical in Kant’s sense. And even  if Žižek did not make a factual error, it is unclear why fi lming oneself during  the departure of one’s wife and daughter should count as ethical. Acting con- trary to one’s desire (in Filip’s case, the desire to stop his wife from leaving  him) does not mean one is acting in accordance with a universal moral law. Turning to interpretations deriving from factual errors and leading to  theoretical and interpretative fallacies, in Fright of Real Tears Žižek groups  together the aerial view of Bodega Bay from The Birds with Arbogast’s killing  from Psycho as shots that, by constructing the place of impossible subjectiv- ity (of the Thing itself construed as another variation of the Real), undermine  suture.89 These two examples, which in his writings on fi lm exemplify various  theses, now play a pivotal role in Žižek’s exposition of suture in Hitchcock’s  fi lms. Demonstrating the factual errors at the foundation of his argument ren- ders numerous subsequent theoretical and interpretative discussions otiose.  Except for the theoretical discussion of suture, these include numerous inter- 85. Ibid., 151. 86. Žižek also says the following: “Is the topic of our fi rst chapter, the choice between  Theory and Post-Theory, not yet another case of the ethical choice between event and Be- ing, between ethics and morality, between mission and life?” Ibid., 148. Given that I have  argued Žižek should be taken at face value I must reply, “No, it is not.” 87. Ibid., 138. 88. Ibid. 89. Ibid., 36–38. </page> <page sequence="20"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s Approach to Film 747 pretative analogies to Hitchcockian Jensenism, Lacan’s initial articulation of  the big Other, and most importantly, to the void of the Real as the constitutive  kernel of the subject.90 First, bearing in mind Žižek’s account of suture and enunciation quoted  above, one would imagine that this type of procedure, which establishes a  diegetic source for the point of view presented would be exemplary of suture,  not the obverse. Second, like the Bodega Bay shot, the sequence of Arbogast’s  murder gives no reason to think that the shot of Arbogast falling down the  stairs is “the ‘subjective’ shot from the standpoint of the murderous Thing  itself.”91 There are two clearly objective tracking shots of Arbogast ascending  the stairs that keep the same distance from him throughout. The shot of Arbo- gast falling down the stairs inverts these earlier shots as far as the direction  of the camera is concerned, but retains their objective character. Moreover,  the camera does not move away from Arbogast’s face as he falls down the  stairs. If this were a subjective shot, it would mean that the murderer must be  following Arbogast down the stairs as Arbogast traverses them backwards.  Yet, when Arbogast eventually comes to rest at the foot of the staircase, the  murderer’s feet are seen running down the steps to fi nish him off . Continuity  editing would demand that the murderer was already there, ready to strike,  when Arbogast collapsed. Žižek appears most interested in analyzing a fi lm’s formal features in his  interpretation of the aerial shot of Bodega Bay from The Birds. This shot fol- lows the explosion of the gas station and gives us an overview of the attacked  town. During the shot, birds enter from off -screen, signaling the imminence  of another attack. As noted earlier, Žižek’s discussion of the shot is repeated  on numerous occasions in his work and the gist of it remains the same: what  is initially perceived as an objective shot of the town from above is, “with  the entry into the frame of the birds, resignifi ed, subjectivised into the point  of view of the evil aggressors themselves.”92 This reading obviously miscon- strues what happens on screen, however. No cue marks the transformation  into the subjective shot; the camera does not shake nor does it start to move  together with the fl ock of birds. It just remains fi xed as more and more birds  fi ll the frame. What seems particularly worrisome about Žižek’s insistence on  this reading is that it contradicts his own guidelines for the transformation of  objective shots into subjective ones. Žižek clearly states that there needs to  be a “codifi ed marker” such as the trembling of the camera or a subjectivized  soundtrack for this transformation to take place, yet he identifi es neither de- vice in the Bodega Bay shot.93 To compound the problem, the discussion of the Bodega Bay shot in Look- ing Awry is connected with the categorization of various tracking shots, which  are, according to Žižek, privileged Hitchcockian procedures “for isolating the  90. These interpretative discussions take place in Žižek, Everything You Always  Wanted to Know about Lacan, 252–63. Additionally, in the case of Arbogast’s murder,  these include interpretative discussions of subjectivization, passage from hysteria to per- version, and of the triad of visual “negation of negation” in Psycho.

Ibid. </page> <page sequence="21"> 748 Slavic Review stain, this remainder of the real that ‘sticks out.’”94 Žižek argues that the aerial  shot of the town is exemplary of the “immobile tracking shot,” apparently  depicting the shift  from the reality to the Real (of the Thing). This “immobile  tracking shot” is contrasted to a “hystericized tracking shot” (in fact, not a  tracking shot at all but a move-in on the object through rapid cuts). Žižek also  fi nds the exemplary “hystericized” shot in The Birds—namely, the move-in  shot on the pecked-out eyes of Mitch’s mother’s dead neighbor.95 The fact that  two out of the four types of tracking shots Žižek identifi es are not in fact track- ing shots at all evinces either his carelessness about clearly defi ned termi- nology or his modest talents as a fi lm theorist. In other words, Žižek makes  accepted fi lm terminology accommodate Lacan and not the other way around.  These comments should not be understood to suggest that I am preventing  Žižek from making any typology of shots based on whatever criteria would  suit his purposes. It is merely to say that if he presents his discussion as a ty- pology of the tracking shot as he does and then proceeds to introduce external  elements to a clearly defi ned set, then I have every right to call him on it. Finally, the conclusion to part 2 of Looking Awry on Hitchcock—a discus- sion of Hitchcockian montage—establishes another faulty generalization. For  the “zero degree of Hitchcockian” montage—the dissection of scenes in which  a character approaches the Thing such as Lila’s approach toward the house  in Psycho—two injunctions are given: “Forbidden are the objective shot of  the Thing, of the ‘uncanny’ object, and—above all—the subjective shot of the  approaching person from the perspective of the ‘uncanny’ object itself.”96 A  counterexample for the former may easily be found. The fi nal scene of The  Birds in which the protagonists exit the bird-surrounded house and enter their  getaway car abounds with objective shots of the birds, that is, the Thing. I have  not been able to fi nd a counterexample for the latter, but it is noteworthy that  Žižek implicitly does so. His account of Arbogast’s murder as seen through a  subjective shot of the murderous Thing, although inaccurate, demonstrates  internal inconsistency. Yet again we are faced either with Žižek’s hasty gener- alizations or with his sketchy understanding of fi lm analysis vocabulary. Having come this far, two things might worry the reader. The fi rst is an  almost naive faith in propositional factuality that these pages appear to elicit,  which is unheard of today given the work of thinkers such as Michel Foucault  or Thomas Kuhn. The other is what might seem overconfi dence in the exis- tence of some universal norms of interpretative practice. Allow me to assuage  these concerns with my concluding remarks. In the fi rst case, although it has been demonstrated that it is very un- likely there are any theory-independent facts, that Žižek is practically never  defended by resorting to claims that his mistakes are only mistakes from a  theoretical point of view he does not subscribe to, strongly suggests that there  is a consensus within the academic community about what an incorrect de- scription of a particular textual segment is. (And this does not contradict Fou- 94. Žižek, Looking Awry, 93. 95. Ibid., 96–97. 96. Ibid., 117. </page> <page sequence="22"> The Rhetorics of Interpretation and Žižek’s Approach to Film 749 cault’s or Kuhn’s fi ndings but suggests that whatever the theory employed in  identifying incorrect descriptions is, it is shared by the community.) Rather,  the most common line of defense is to argue, like Davies does, that in the  grand scheme of things local mistakes do not really matter or that they should  be understood as provocations, the value of which lies in generating further  discussions. In this article, I have argued that both lines of defense are mis- taken. The latter fails because whatever values provocation might hold, Žižek  does not intend his assertions merely as provocations but as genuine appeals  to truth as well. Therefore, it is completely legitimate and worthwhile to draw  attention to cases when these assertions are false. The former type of defense  falters because the supposedly irrelevant local mistakes are stepping stones  for further discussions. One cannot build a house on compromised founda- tions and hope it will levitate once they collapse. As far as the second point is concerned, I have never claimed that there  are or should be universal norms for interpretative practice. If at one point in- terpretations that consist of nothing but strings of conclusions about various  aspects of the work were to appear, this would not immediately warrant their  dismissal even if my criteria were to be employed. It would just mean that, if  the conclusions were compelling enough, we might want to try to see whether  there is an argumentatively valid manner according to which the conclusions  could be arrived at. Nor have I argued against interpretations that are strictly  intrasubjective, that is, exclusively concerned with expressing one’s own phe- nomenological engagement with the text and disinterested in argumentation.  Such work is perfectly legitimate and may be as illuminating as any other.97  Having said this, the fact remains that such cases, if there even are any in the  pure form described above, are exceptions. The bulk of interpretative practice  generally and certainly that of Žižek relies on intersubjective assertions about  the text in question and arguments based on these assertions in order to se- cure their rhetorical eff ect, that is, to persuade their readers into accepting  them as accurate descriptions of the text. What the main claim of this article  boils down to is that in such cases the best way to gauge the rhetorical ef- fects of such interpretations and, in turn, to decide whether to accept them or  not is to check the assertions, arguments, and concepts employed therein for  propositional factuality, argumentative validity, and conceptual coherence.  The key advantage of these criteria over matters of interest is that their clarity  and relative ease of application allows for a greater number of participants to  take part in the process of arbitrage on an equal footing. 97. Other types of interpretations may be imagined for which my evaluative criteria  would not be relevant. For instance, accounts that appear to be intrasubjective but make  no claim that they involve one’s own engagement with the text, but instead describe a  possible engagement with it. </page> </plain_text>
