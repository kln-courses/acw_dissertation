While works by Fatima Mernissi, Riff at Hassan, and Amina Wadud come readily to mind, Asma Barlas's more recent Believing Women joins their ranks in examining how the accumulated tradition regarding gender roles in Muslim societies might be re-envisioned. Worthy of classroom use, this book questions earlier methodologies of Qur'anic hermeneutics, emphasizes the importance of linking divine ontology to divine speech as a hermeneutical method, and analyzes the manner in which Qur'anic interpretation was made to lend itself readily to pre-existent patriarchal and misogynist modes of social organization. The author also takes on the thorny issue of the Qur'an's recommendations on polygamy, divorce, and wife-beating to argue that although the Qur'an recognizes biological differences, it does not advocate a theory of sex/gender differentiation or gender dualism. Barlas' central question is "whether or not the Qur'an is a patriarchal text." Her primary presupposition is that "the Qur'an was revealed in/to an existing patriarchy and has been interpreted by adherents of patriarchies ever since," thereby making it imperative for Muslim women to "have a stake in challenging its patriarchal exegesis" (xi). Barlas is well aware of the tightrope she must walk between conservative Muslims likely to label her a "Western feminist" and feminists who are likely to label her a "Muslim apologist" for reading the Qur'an in a manner that compares favorably to feminist discourses, or for suggesting that the West's Other might offer any truths.

For instance, does the Qur'an represent God as a Father or male, and does it teach that God enjoys a special relationship with males, who embody divine attributes? Or does the Qur'an privilege men based upon their biology, treating men as normative members of society while treating women as the Other? Does it view men and women as binary opposites? To address these questions, Barias lays out her arguments with respect to reading the Qur'an, reading patriarchy, reading liberation, and entering the hermeneutic circle/spiral. Arguing that the Qur'an is a polys?mie text and hence open to variant readings, Barias contends that the extra-textual contexts in which the Qur'an has historically been read and interpreted by Muslim interpretive communities and political authorities played a formative role "in shaping religious knowledge and authority in ways that enabled patriarchal readings of the Qur'an" (5). Barlas' counterclaim is that the Qur'an is egalitarian and anti-patriarchal, arguing that historically conservative Muslims have read misogyny into the Qur'an to legitimize their contemporary practices (5). Rather than reading the Qur'an as an integral text that is historically situated, Muslim exegetes have studied it verse by verse, chapter by chapter, without noting its thematic and structural coherence?a point previously argued by Wadud. Attention to such coherence is essential to understanding the Qur'an's polyvalent meanings, as is the recognition that the Qur'an is a historical text imbedded in the contexts in which revelation was made. Furthermore, as misogynistic readings of the Qur'an by classical and medieval commentators have gained authoritative status, the fine line between the text itself and the commentators' interpretations has been crossed, rendering the commentaries themselves the key instruments for understanding the text. In attempting to develop a methodology for reading the Qur'an that stems from the text itself, Barlas distinguishes between Divine Discourse and a fixed text subject to historically contextualized interpretation. Blurring this distinction runs afoul of the Qur'an's own warning not to confuse the revelation with its readings (39:18). Clarifying this distinction allows one to see that "many ideas and practices, including the theme of patriarchy, ascribed to the Qur'an do not originate in it or have been read into the text in contextually problematic ways" (11). Barlas defines patriarchy in a narrow sense to mean a mode of rule by fathers, assuming a real and symbolic continuum "between a patriarchalized view of God as Father/male, and a theory of father-right, extending to the husband's claim to rule over his wife and children" (12). In a more general sense, patriarchy constitutes a politics of sexual differentiation that privileges males, based in "an ideology that ascribes social/sexual inequalities to biology; that is, it confuses sexual/biological differences with gender dualisms/inequality" (12). Barlas lays the burden of failing to recover the Qur'an's anti-patriarchal stance squarely on the shoulders of commentators who have erred not only in their hermeneutic task of reading the Qur'an as an organic, historically contextualized entity, but also in their theological task of minding "how a Scripture is experienced within the context of a distinctive image of, and relationship to God" (13).</page><page sequence="3">158 Arab Studies Journal Fall 20031 Spring 2004 In defining a Qur'anic hermeneutics, Barlas suggests that God's Self-Disclosure (divine ontology) must be considered in order to read God's Speech (divine revelation). Three cardinal aspects of divinity come to the forefront: the principles of Divine Unity, Justness, and Incomparability. As Absolute Sovereign, God retains this right and no theory of male or other sovereignty can claim to be an extension of God's Sovereignty, as to do so would run counter to the cardinal principle of divine unity or tawhid. God's Justness is such that the divine being would under no circumstances countenance zulm or the transgression of the rights of a person, suggesting that divine justice is incompatible with infringing a human's right as a moral agent. Thus, God cannot be a misogynist or one who "violates women's rights by denying them agency and dignity" (which is what patriarchies do) (14). Further, God's Incomparability (Qur'an 112:1-4) means that God cannot be represented in anthropomorphic terms. The Qur'an's rejection of God's sexualization or engenderment confirms that God is not a male, or Father, nor is there any special affinity between God and males. These ontological considerations need to be valued as hermeneutical sites from which to read the Qur'an's anti-patriarchal stance (15). The key features, then, of a hermeneutics of the Qur'an are to connect divine ontology to divine speech. The Qur'an ought to be read intra-textually as a holistic document, and read contextually in order to locate the text historically. The Qur'an enjoins believers to "reflect" in deciphering its polys?mie meanings. Contesting the claim that only males know what God really means, Barlas discloses that she comes to the text as a believing Muslim woman who looks to the Qur'an itself for her understanding of sexual equality, and who draws upon the Qur'an and Muslim tradition?especially in the use of reason and knowledge to understand Scripture?for her engagement with the text (19). She reads the Qur'an to "discover what God may have intended,"(23) thereby ascribing intention to the text; and she looks not only at what the Qur'an says, but at what it does not say, interpreting its silences "in light of its expressed teachings" (22). She reads "behind the text," that is, examines "the historical contexts in which the Qur'an was revealed and read and the means by which its teachings came to be overlaid by a patriarchal exegesis" (23). But she also reads "in front of the text," by recontextualizing it with attention to the needs of the present, arguing that ongoing Qur'anic interpretation is necessary in order to attest to the universal applicability and relevance of the scriptural text. Chapters two through six compellingly substantiate and marshal evidence for the claims made in the first chapter. The second chapter examines the relationship between interpretive practices and interpretive meanings of the sacred text, taking as an example the verses relating to the veil. The third chapter explores the relationship between authoritative texts such as the Qur'an, hadith, fiqh (rules of legal jurisprudence), tafsir (commentaries on the Qur'an), and kalam (theology) and extra-textual contexts such as the state, law, and tradition. Here, Barlas argues that the producers of religious knowledge devised methods of interpretation that were self-referential and self-producing, and also accumulative rather than creative interpretations, thereby leading to a canonization of interpretive meanings that were generated over ten centuries ago. Collaboration between such producers of religious</page><page sequence="4">159 knowledge and the state produced a situation "in which the Qur'an's authority would be subordinated to that of the Sunnah [Islamic theorization and praxis] and the Sunnah's authority to that of interpretive communities" (81). Currently, the state's collusion with conservative Islamic interpretations to retain its own legitimacy has resulted in injecting "coercive power into the very heart of knowledge construction in many Muslim societies," making it difficult to generate liberatory readings (88). The fourth to the sixth chapters examine whether patriarchy as defined earlier is borne out in the Qur'an, whether it is possible to derive a theory of gender from the Qur'an, and how the Qur'an understands the notion of family. Throughout the book Barlas differentiates her development of an Islamic epistemology from that of Western or feminist epistemologies. Indeed, her work includes the rather curious statement that "while I draw on both Western and Muslim theories to make my argument, I do not pretend that it is possible, or even desirable, to attempt a synthesis between Qur'anic and Western epistemology" (25). Perhaps this is the only instance where a greater degree of problematization is needed in this otherwise brilliantly executed work. The term Western is here used without the nuance it deserves. While the Qur'an itself may not be a patriarchal and misogynist text as Barlas cogently and to good effect tries to show, there is no negating the fact that much of the post-Qur'anic imagery?whether commentarial or legalistic, expressed in state or social institutions?drew upon the same cultural capital that comprised the societies over which the early Islamic empire came to rule (for instance, the Byzantine and Sassanian). Nor is Islam's monotheism radically different from its sister monotheisms with regard to its claim towards a sovereign, good and just God. Muslims of later generations created in their readings of the sacred text much the same Father/male figure that the Jewish and Christian traditions did, and privileged males as extensions of divine authority much as the sister monotheisms did in their own societies. And indeed, in faulting classical commentators for their lack of hermeneutic sophistication and in identifying the role of extra-textual factors in patriarchal readings of the Qur'an, Barlas would appear to agree that at the time when classical commentaries were being produced, the epistemologies of different peoples in the Islamicate world (including Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Hindus), especially with respect to understandings of gender, did not differ significantly. Hence, feminist challenges to patriarchal authority and misogyny in Judaism and Christianity, and in the "West" more generally could equally be applied to the Islamic intellectual and social imagery (and indeed, this is one of the elements of Barlas's project). As the work of Jewish and Christian feminists has shown, fresh readings of scripture are the starting point from which to re-envision anti-patriarchal and non-misogynist readings and applications of the sacred text. These go alongside a careful analysis of how hermeneutic methods and scriptural uses employed by religious and political authorities established gender dualism and misogyny within the societies in which these traditions operated. Barlas ends her work on the somewhat pessimistic note that although as a Muslim woman she has a "great deal at stake in combating repressive readings of the Qur'an,"</page><page sequence="5">160 Arab Studies Journal Fall 20031 Spring 2004 she thinks it unlikely that the hermeneutic strategies offered in her book will make a dent in the historically repressive, misogynistic, and patriarchal understandings of the sacred text, which many Muslim states employ in furthering the cause of religious terrorism towards women (209). Still, I believe that hope lies in a new generation of scholar-activists who will take cues from such a study to open up interpretations and modes of Islamic praxis that will resonate with the avowedly non-repressive divine intentions for Muslim and other faith communities worldwide.</page></plain_text>
