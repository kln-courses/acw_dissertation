<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES TRIVIA ULYSSEANA IV Fritz Senn Brood of Tempters Stephen Dedalus ?in this respect consubstantial with his author ?is well up in the heresies which questioned the nature of the Son in the Trinity, perhaps from a detailed study of some patristic sources. If your boast is enjoyment of the gorbellied works of St. Thomas Aquinas in the original, you may well have immersed yourself in some refutations of the heretics; but one never knows. The name of a treatise on sin, Agenbite oflnwit, affects Stephen poignantly, but that does not mean he need ever have gone beyond its title (the text has been a favorite to teach and learn Middle English). Stephen is quite willing to air an eccentric Shakespearean theory while admitting the existence of "all the other plays which I have not read" (U 212.24). So we are left with guesses. Knowledge about Trinitarian deviations could have come in many ways, and it may have been recalled through one source that will be mentioned in this note. Early on in the book, in what is the longest run of associations in "Telemachus," four main heresiarchs are marshalled, along with their modern, glib, mimetic counterpart, Buck Mulligan (U 21.6-12). His hypostatic impersonation and the blasphemous ballad of Joking Jesus1 (U18-19) provoke Haines to examine Stephen's beliefs. The question, "You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God" (U 19.33-35), may well trigger off, in some deep down layer of Stephen's mind, an obsessive chain of unfree thought ?the Credo (which is the actual sense of the word). He certainly slips the end of the Creed into the conversation, the English version, "... and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church" ("Roman" is interjected to explain "Italian" in a preceding line (U 20.35, 28); if you're a stickler for definitions, "Roman" would otherwise be a parochial challenge of the basic meaning of "catholic"). While Haines rambles on Stephen in 151</page><page sequence="2">ternally listens to the original: ". . .et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam" (U 20.42). Actually he hears these words as music, from Palestrina's Mass for Pope Marcellus.2 The two later full developments of the Creed in the book emphasize features which are already significant in the morning scene: one is a heretical translation, with Gregorian notation3 (U197); the other one (U 329) a British imperialist rendering, as imagined by a servant of "The imperial British state" (U 20.34). For Stephen, the uneasily and unconvincingly professed non believer, the disputes of the early church are not matters for idle mockery? words never are. He is fascinated, disquieted, tempted by words, music, blasphemies, threats. The horde of heresies he conjures up, the brief roll call of Trinitarian squibblers, looks, among other things, also like a condensation of a brief sequence from a work which we know Joyce put to use for "Circe," where doubts, menaces and blasphemies are staged in a related manner, La Tentation de Saint An toine. We have been prepared for temptation (and for stage tech niques) by Buck Mulligan (1/6.33). Flaubert's horde of heresiarchs appear in a scene near the beginning of part four of his book of indeterminate genre: naturally he has more than Stephen calls up (and he does not enlist Photius). The similarity is mainly in the quick succession of position statements, the mode of Tentation (or "Circe") being simply transposed into the initial interior monologue. In the order of appearance: ARIUS.. .le Fils n'est pas co?ternel au P?re, ni de m?me substance!. . . {U21.8-9). SABELLIUS. ?Mois, je soutiens que tous deux sont identiques. . . . {U21.11-12). VALENTIN. ?[refuting resurrection! -Impossible,- son corps ?tant c?leste!... (1/21.9-10). Et tous les h?r?siarques font un cercle. . .4 {U 20.11). At any rate, the applause Stephen imagines at the conclusion of his peroration is in French (U 21.18). At least one more version immediately following is woven into "Circe": "UN JUIF (? barbe rouge, la peau macul?e de l?pre, s'avance, pr?s de lui; et ricanant horriblement). ? Son ?me ?tait l'?me d'Esaii!. .. et sa m?re, la parfumeuse, s'est livr?e ? Pantherus, un soldat ro main . . . . " The role is taken on by Virag, who rattles off heresies about Jesus (U 520.21-23) and repeats the same story: "Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her.. ." (U 521.20-21); see Gifford and Seidman, Notes for Joyce: An Annotation of Joyce's "Ulysses, " pp. 408-09 on this). "Son ?me ?tait lame d'Esa?" may be a redundant gloss for "The voice is the voice of Esau"; its application to Jesus is surely "not in the penny catechism" (U 472.4, 8). 152</page><page sequence="3">In the same passage, Flaubert has Methodius say, He was first in Adam, then in Man; and Merinthians claim He was nothing but a man, while Hermog?ne thinks: "Il habite le soleil" ?all these are possi bilities conjugated in Ulysses in some place or other, and see, in par ticular 485.31. The Sethianians have it that "C'?tait Sem, fils de No?," which is definitely not in Ulysses but would have been appreciated by the Penman of the Wake and fitted into the first riddle of the universe, "when is a man not a man?," with its fourteen wrong answers (FW 170.5-24).5 One alternative sacrilege, the one uttered by "LES APPOLLINAR ISTES. ? Il en a pris l'apparence! Il a simul? la Passion," has affinities with concerns and techniques of Ulysses as well as the Wake. But it may already have helped to shape the Tentation de Saint Etienne as conducted by Cranly: ? Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus was not what he pretended to be? .. .did the idea ever occur to you that he was himself a con scious hypocrite, what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? Or, to put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard? (P 242). In the earlier version, "Did it ever strike you that Jesus may have been an impostor?" is connected with "the hypostatic union" (SH 141.15, 21). The Stephen who will not serve still admits fear (P 243), and some of those fears have been revived by Mulligan's flippancies, by Haines's questions, his own listing of three masters, by chemical actions set up in his soul by sacrilege and by symbols behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration6 ? and perhaps alleviated a bit by tempting literary echoes. While Stephen is fretting publicly against three masters, perhaps his creator is silently acknowledging a master of his own choice, one, curiously, that is never mentioned at all and remains mostly invisible, but is recog nizable at times within the handiwork. NOTES 1 Oddly enough, the ballad is given two names, equally alliterative: "Joseph the Joiner," "Joking Jesus"; a little like an early appellation of Stephen, "jejune Jesuit" (U 4.09), as though the initials had some particular meaning. 2 See joy cenotes, I (June 1969), 8; // 443, and Budgen, p. 177. I remember how, one day in summer 1967, Frank Budgen and Paul Su ter were recalling Joyce's strange habits, such as suddenly beginning to intone, in the Z?rich streets, those words from Palestrina's Mass, and they both sang together "... et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam" in prolonged, resonant Latin, and I had some idea of what may have been meant by "brazen bells." 153</page><page sequence="4">3 And an extended echo of "Bells with bells with bells aquiring" (U 198.4) 4 Gustave Flaubert, Oeuvres compl?tes, ed., Bernard Masson, (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1964), pp. 539-40. AU passages subsequently quoted or paraphrased are from page 540. 5 A study of St. Antonian references would be helpful. Richard K. Cross, in his Flau bert and Joyce (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1971), has dealt with more essential affinities; a judicious list of specific adaptations would help us understand not only the "Circe" chapter a little better. 6 I believe that similar repressed fears surface through the harmless line "My familiar, after me, calling. . ." (U 20.17), see JJQ, 12(Summer 1975), 443. Taxilonomy ? Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position? ? C'est le pigeon, Joseph (U 41.14-15). It was Marvin Magalaner who discovered how well L?o Taxil, with his pamphlets and parodies and his own Protean adaptations and changes of color, fits into the third chapter of Ulysses. See Time and Apprenticeship: The Fiction of Young James Joyce (London: Abelard Schuman, 1959), pp. SOff.1 Here I simply add a few marginal frills. In the Gospel according to L?o Taxil, alias Gabriel (!) Jogand-Pag?s, Marie, alias Marion, fianc?e of simple-minded Joseph, is pregnant and clearly deceiving him. The relevant dialogue after his realization her condition is quoted again: ? Joseph, mon ami, je vous jure que vous vous trompez.... Je suis aussi pure que l'enfant qui na?tra de moi.... ? Aussi pure que votre future poupon, dites-vous!.... Eh bien, elle est raide, celle-l?... ? Joseph, mon gros lapin, je vous donne ma parole d'honneur que je suis tou jours digne de vous.... Aucun homme ne peut se vanter d'avoir seulement bais? le bout de mes doigts ... ? Ta, ta, ta, je ne prends pas des vessies pour des lanternes.... Qui donc, si ce n'est un homme, vous a mis dans cette fichue position? ? C'est le pigeon, Joseph! (La vie de J?sus [Paris: Librairie anti-cl?ricale, 18841, p. 15). Marion's appellation, "mon gros lapin," is carried into the passage following the remembered dialogue at (U 41.14) and connected with the lapping of milk: ". . .he lapped the sweet lait chaud with pink young tongue, plump bunny's face. Lap, lapin" (U 41.18), making "lap" scintillating and an echo, perhaps, also of the word as figurative usage for the anatomical part where all the trouble started. Compare Richie Goulding's "lapboard" (U 39.6) and, outside of the chapter, a 154</page><page sequence="5">LA VIC DC JESUS LES SOUP?ONS DE JOSEPH ?

Patrice Egan, "Son of the wild goose," and as naive almost as Joseph, hopes to win "in the gros lots," so that even "gros" seems to be salvaged in a little cluster of expatriate or blasphemous French. Joseph says, erroneously, that he won't be fooled: "je ne prends pas des vessies pour des lanternes," as the French put it. "Proteus" is, of course, a deceptive playground where bladders can be taken for lanterns, appearances for other appearances. "Pigeon" is such a decep tive appearance (both in French and Joyce's Anglo-Irish it can stand for an endearment, see P 102.25, in doubtful context), and Joseph is ultimately taken in. As it happens, Joyce's chapter can oblige with "bladderwrack" (U 44.33), to say nothing of an implied urination, as well as with "Lantern" ? but this, trickily and synecdochically, is not a source of light but part of a nickname for a person (U 39.42). In the following section, another Marion, in a somewhat similar cross examination, will try to talk about, say, lanterns while her husband, having just passed St. Joseph's, knows that it is really all about something else. One should not overwork the spectral presence of a French locution figur?e. Still one might be reminded of the not even tacit juxtaposition of the two things in the micturition scene in "Ithaca," where strange entities are being compared: there is a lamp (U 702.26) faintly il luminating goings-on in which two bladders are involved and in which there is mention of pressure which is termed "vesical" (a word that is cognate with vessie ?U 703.10). This may be a case of a com mentator taking, in his turn, a bladder for a luminous sign. In Taxil's version, Joseph remains suspicious, and a third party is worked in to complete the French triangle: "// y avait m?me un certain cousin, du nom de Panther, sur qui la m?re Anne arr?tait particu li?rement ses soup?ons; ce cousin Panther n ?tait pas mal de sa per sonne. .." (La vie de J?sus, pp. 15-16). This Panther appears in "Circe" too, right after Philip Drunk and Philip Sober have appropriated Joseph's and Marie's cross-talk, which in turn immediately follows the overlapping affair of "Mary Shortall" and "Jimmy Pidgeon" (U 520-21). But there is also the panther of Stephen's dream in "Proteus" assqciated with a metamorphosed dog (which may also be an inverted God? U 47.3). In Taxil's story, however, Joseph is freed from all his misgivings in a dream in which suspicion is lifted from Panther (p. 16): Joseph takes Gabriel's word for it, becomes a devoted husband and a believer in pigeons. Once the stage is set for so many changes on the fichue position, it is interesting to observe that Patrice's mother, Kevin Egan's estranged 156</page><page sequence="7">wife, is set up in Paris with "canary and two buck lodgers" (U 43.40). In this phrase, "buck" determines the sex of the lodgers just as does a later word that of "canary": ". . .her cup of canary for every cockcanary"; and it is the novel's L?o Taxil, Buck Mulligan, who also links this bird to a saint, "Margaret Mary Anycock" (U 202.2-4) and soon goes on to ask "Whom do you suspect?" Joyce's excision of just two shortened lines from Taxil's belabored account ? an abbreviation which allows for that flash of delayed in sight which has become a Joycean trademark ? may give a wrong im pression of conciseness: this is not a feature of La vie de J?sus (a matter of 389 cumbersome pages). But both writers translate into contem porary ordinary or even low life and into the vernacular. In the fifties and sixties there were quite a few scholars who mainly reversed the translation and considered Ulysses above all, and a trifle monot onously, Joyce's version of the Life of Christ, for which of course they found enough symbolic evidence all along. There remains another point, a grammatical one, which does not seem to have been taken up. What Joseph asks, and what Joyce copied accurately from Taxil's printed text, ought to read, being addressed to a personne, conspicuously of the feminine gender, "Qui vous a mise. .. . " Any teacher of French will bear me out on this, and , in any case, the French translation of Ulysses set things right (right?) from the first printing onwards2 (here it would be useful to know the extent of Joyce's supervision). Joyce may well have been aware of Taxil's ?or is it supposed to be Joseph's? ? deviation from the strict rules of gram mar. As spoken by Philip Drunk to Philip Sober, "Qui vous a mis. . ." is of course correct; Stephen himself in his variation of the phrase, "M. L?o Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'?tait le sacr? pigeon, ventre de Dieu! (U 391.38) is linguistically alert, if not idiomatically smooth or elegant. One wonders what all of this means for a "correct" text. Joyce wrote and, most likely, meant "mis," masculine and/or in determinate. This form suits the strategy of withholding clues for identification, leaving room for speculation and doubt. It also rein forces our suspicion of printed or written documents. (The telegram Stephen remembers at 1/42.15 should be garbled and read: "Nother dying....") Things have a way of going wrong. It's nice to think that Taxil, or his printer, inadvertently, helped to make a line of print more fichued up. 157</page><page sequence="8">NOTES 1 See the summaries given by Weldon Thornton, Allusions in "Ulysses," pp. 50-51; and Gifford and Seidman, Notes for Joyce: An Annotation of Joyce's "Ulysses," p. 37. 2 ?Qui vous a mise dans cette fichue position? "Ulysses," traduit de l'anglais par M. Auguste Morel, assist? par M. Stuart Gilbert. Traduction enti?rement revue par M. Val?rie Larbaud avec la collaboration de l'auteur (Paris: La Maison des Amis des Livres, 1929), p. 45. Chap in the Paybox Wonder have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens they say. O'Brien (U 68.25). There were many O'Briens in Dublin, and I doubt that Bloom is thinking of either William Smith or James Francis Xavier of the same name (see Thornton, Allusions, p. 75; Gif ford and Seidman, Notes, p. 58). Who got away James Stephens is one of the returning puzzles (U 43.25,163.39, 316.21, 484.12). Rumors may have been multiplied also because at the time of his escape three hundred pounds were offered for the arrest of any accomplice in his escape ?a paying game. That does not account for the chap in the paybox. What is certain and the kind of thing Bloom might well know, with an eye for potential clients, is that the superintendent of the Corpora tion Public Baths, Wash Houses, and Public Swimming Baths in Tara street was J.P. O'Brien; the matron's name was Annie O'Brien (accord ing to Thorns Directory for 1904, p. 1606). Why legend should have attributed the heroic escape to this O'Brien we may never find out. But it needn't have, nor is O'Brien necessarily the chap in the paybox. It might well be that rumor long ago once focused on someone taking the money in the Tara street baths, and Bloom would remember. As he does so he thinks of the man now in charge (whether ever sitting in the box or not). Such is the jerky pro gression of thought. The exact relation of a sequence of notations may escape us. As did James Stephens. (Joyce may have enjoyed the thought that nobody will ever know how a real Irishman whose name was composed of James and Stephen[s] got away.) Lost Cause " ? We were always loyal to lost causes. . ." (U 133.10, etc.) Obviously one more set phrase, one often used, as can be seen, for 158</page><page sequence="9">example, by the quotation marks in an entry of a book on historical Dublin: The accession of Henry VII. gave to the Geraldines an opportunity to exhibit Ireland as that "Home of lost causes" which she was to become in her relations to English royalty (Samuel A. Ossory Fitzpatrick, Dublin: A Historical and Topo graphical Account [London; Methuen, 1907], p. 45). Fitzpatrick then tells how the Irish backed the losers when, in 1485, the Lancastrians were victorious, notably Gerald Fitzgerald, the Great Earl of Kildare (U 231), who went on supporting scions of York, even pretenders like Lambert Simnel (U 45). The phrase may well go back to an exponent of the tongue of the race whose mentality Professor MacHugh despises ?Matthew Arnold who called not Ireland, but the University of Oxford ''Home of lost causes and forsaken beliefs, and unpopular names and impossible loyalties" (Preface to Essays in Criticism). Oxford and Matthew Arnold have already been associated in the first chapter (U 7.29). OTvladden Burke goes on in the same vein by quoting 'They went forth to battle. . ., but they always fell" (U 133.32). Among the literary ancestry of this saying Gif ford and Seid man have traced Matthew Arnold as well (Notes for Joyce, p. 110). Frozen Wit Much of the stuff of "Aeolus" consists of words of wisdom or beauty formulated in the past which have been repeated, copied, and reap plied. One item is Seymour Bushe's (or is it JJ. O'Molloy's?) phrase, "that stony effigy in frozen music," in a polished period (U 140.12). It was Goethe who, probably first, called architecture frozen music: "... Ich habe unter meinen Papieren ein Blatt gefunden, wo ich die Baukunst eine erstarrte Musik nenne. Und wirklich, es hat etwas: die Stimmung, die von der Baukunst ausgeht, kommt dem Effekt der Musik nahe" (Gespr?che mit Eckermann, 23 March, 1829). The Ger man participle "erstarrt" (literally become stiff, rigid; the word is cognate with Greek stereos, as in stereotype) would describe the language of the "Aeolus" chapter even better than "frozen." Goethe's comparison was taken up widely, by Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling, for example, in his Philosophie der Kunst: "Architecture is music in space, as it were a frozen music" (quoted after Stevensons Book of Quota tions [London: Cassell, 1967], p. 95). Note that "as it were" character izes a type of style and actually appears in Dan Dawson's speech (U 125.30, 33 ?not of course dependent on Schelling's phrase). Arthur 159</page><page sequence="10">Schopenhauer in his esthetic studies quoted Goethe's saying and noted that the "perky witticism",had been often repeated in the last thirty years, that is, had already become a clich?. Oddly enough, he even made a remark on an Aeolian function of the saying. He assumed that Goethe probably used the analogy in conversation long before it was recorded: "Wahrscheinlich hat er viel fr?her jenes Witzwort in der Konversation fallen lassen, wo es denn bekanntlich nie an Leuten gefehlt hat, die was er so fallen Hess auflasen, um nacher damit geschm?ckt einher zu gehen" ? "there have always been people who picked up his asides to use them for their own adornment" would be my rough rendering of what can be found in "Zur Metaphysik der Musik," Chapter 39 of Book Three, Part II of Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung. * Apart from granting an analogy between rhythm and symmetry, Schopenhauer did not agree. Both terms, rhythm and sym metry, from their respective arts, often serve as analogies for Joyce's symphonic structures too. Rhetoric, at any rate, takes account of the architecture and the musicality of its devices ? verbal adornment. The above remarks are not meant to claim the German idealists as links to Bushes faded eloquence, but merely to point to the existence of some pertinent pedigree. But this may be the occasion to mention that Schopenhauer, throughout his esthetic speculations, makes much of the distinction between "nacheinander" (time, music, language) and "nebeneinander" (space, pictorial arts, architecture), as does Stephen (17 38). Perhaps his views deserve as much attention as those of Less ing (see, and supplement, "Esthetic Theories" ? JJQ, 2[Winter 1965], 134-36). NOTE * Quoted from Arthur Schopenhauer, Z?rcher Ausgabe: Werke in zehn B?nden (Z?rich: Diogenes, 1977), IV, 534. Sophist Wallops ? You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist... he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope (U 148-49). Appropriately this bit of recondite lore comes from Professor MacHugh, ponderous pundit, who makes a living teaching the ''bla tant Latin language" but thinks he "ought to profess Greek, the 160</page><page sequence="11">language of the mind" (U 133.13, 23). Of parallactic view, in Lenehan s quip, "he mostly sees double" (U 134.7): he compares Jews and Romans, closetmakers and cloacamakers, Trafalgar and Aegospo tami, and he compares Stephen to a disciple of Gorgias, Antisthenes, who studied rhetorics. In showing off, MacHugh introduces an early Homeric critic and, moreover, an interpreter of Odysseus as an orator wielding tropes (see on this Joyce's entry on Antisthenes and Helen in Notebook VIII.A.5 transcribed by Phillip F. Herring in Joyce's Notes and Early Drafts for "Ulysses" (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1977), p. 18; Michael Groden, "Ulysses" in Progress (Prince ton: Princeton University Press, 1977), pp. 91-92; and my own "Odysseische Metamorphosen" in James Joyce "Ulysses": Neuere deutsche Aufs?tze, ed., Th?r?se Fischer-Seidel (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1977), p. 44, as well as JJQ, 10 (Fall 1972), 42. The actual words that Antisthenes used are lost and MacHugh, orator as well, substitutes his own version: "the palm of beauty" is as exemplary a trope as any; "palm" was used in this sense in antiquity where it became synonymous with victory, triumph or glory. A jour nalist like Ignatius Gallaher, held out in the chapter as "a pressman for you" (U 136.1), used it earlier, when he "award[ed] the palm to Berlin," in this case a prize for vice and corrupion (D 78). This figure of speech becomes personified (which in itself is a rhetorical trick) in a later chapter: "Mrs. Gloriana Palme" (U 327.13) in a Cyclopian side-spin. Palm could practically stand for glory. The connection is made almost explicit in a later passage of similar nature, the solemn staging of set phrases, this time a procession of the church where the symbols of the saints are turned into almost tangible ob jects: "And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms... " (U 339.41). Actually Stephen himself was once a palm-bearer, as he remembers when he thinks of his awards for scholarly excellence: "I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano D?dalo, alumno ?p timo, palmam* ferenti" (U 242.31). So palms, to be borne or taken away, belong to the rhetorical arsenal which "Aeolus" includes in its concerns, figures of speech, usually of classical heritage, which now have become the game of second-hand poets and public speakers, less and less memorable. They have become decorations, like, for example, "Palmam qui meruit, ferat" (Let him who has deserved it, bear the palm). This is one of the few surviving lines from the work of the English theologian and Greek scholar John Jortin, whose Lusus Poetici have long been forgotten; but the line survived because it was adopted by the British Royal Navy 161</page><page sequence="12">School. Not very relevant this, except perhaps as an illustration, but oddly enough the line is from a section entitled "Ad Ventos" and was taken over as a motto by a hero who awarded the palm of beauty to a married woman, Horatio, Viscount Nelson, the onehanded adulterer under whose pillar Stephen and MacHugh have just been passing and at whose statue they look in farewell as the chapter closes. That Gibbon, in Decline and Fall (II, 33), refers to a "palm of elo quence" which was attributed to Cicero, is probably just a peripheral, but titillating coincidence. A couple of hours later, in the National Library, Stephen appro priates MacHugh's gloss and fits it into his theory. He sticks to the basic form the professor used and merely adds a few flourishes: "An tisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen,.. . and handed it to poor Penelope" (U 201.17). Alumnus Stephen emends "disciple" to "pupil," includes the shining word "Kyrios" from an earlier one of MacHugh's speeches (U 133.22) and finds a metaphorical variation for Helen ? all of this in the best classical tradition. The phrase itself seems to haunt him, for he recalls it a few minutes later when Mr. Best throws in "the sense of beauty": "Will they wrest from us, from me the palm of beauty?" (U 204.23ff), in a reference to himself which some one should yet explain. The repetition shows that some nerve has been touched in Stephen, but the emphasis in itself would hint at one more literary echo, the peculiarity of "Scylla and Charybdis." And we have in fact a quota tion, slightly changed, and it is ? almost predictably ? from the author whose life and work Stephen analyzes in his oratorical display, from a play which is mentioned just a few pages before, and spoken by the one person who is entitled to use the phrase (prior to the criticism of Antisthenes), by the runaway wife of Menelaus (she is speaking to Paris, however): Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty Gives us more palm in beauty than we have Yea, overshines ourself (Troilus and Cressida, III,i, 171). The "he" Helen has in mind is the character whom Eglinton should have named when he said, incorrectly, that Shakespeare "makes Ulysses quote Aristotle" (U 212.1): it is Hector. Eglinton, like Stephen, can get his facts wrong (as we all do when we quote from memory), but Joyce doesn't get them entirely wrong, for Ulysses has since become a book, and Joyce makes Ulysses quote Aristotle quite a bit, 162</page><page sequence="13">and with modifications, as well as Antisthenes etc., and he makes Stephen and MacHugh, perhaps unwittingly, quote Shakespeare and Helen of Troy (who is, as he was, a bearer of a disputed palm). Note that Shakespeare, in the lines adduced, rhymes "duty" with "beauty," an effect of the kind that is also worked into the literary chapter, where the narrative is often characterized by such internal echoes. And note that "the sense of beauty" now also looks like a change rung on the much more common "sense of duty." Nelson, ruler of the sea, was first alluded to in the novel through a quotation which hinged on "duty" (U 15.32). But these are marginal benefits, and doubtful ones at that, perhaps merely a continuation of the lusus poetici which poets like Joyce or Shakespeare can initiate (but not stop). What we have is just a clich?, one of many, in one way pointedly not worth any attention ?and yet it entwines a number of thematic strands which link back to antiquity, that link rhetorics and literature, Aeolian and Charybdian arts, Homer and Shakespeare, a Greek cynic and a local cynosure, morals (duty) and esthetics, an Athenian critic of Homer and an Irish critic of Shakespeare ? and this was really the link which started it all: "none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself," that was what justified MacHugh's com parison. Stephen is bitter against himself and others. MacHugh hit on the right word; "bitter" (in itself a rhetorical figure, from "biting") ap plies to Stephen in a number of ways. He is plagued by "Love's bitter mystery," by bitter waters, by "a spike named Bitterness" in his bosom (in Bunyanesque diction, U 395.17). He himself names the spike, in Middle English, "Agenbite of Jnwit" (U 16.7, etc., and twice in the Library chapter, 189.27, 206.26): this too, like "remorse," is a trope. As glib and shallow a term as "palm of beauty," it exemplifies not only the pricks of con-science, but also the again-bite of Ulysses, the sting that words have, even stereotypes, because of the wit (understanding, knowledge, the power too of connecting ideas with a happy or ludicrous effect) which inheres in them and in their combination and repetition. NOTE * This recollection of school and palman ferens leads immediately to school and Father Conmee, once rector at Clongowes, who at this moment is reading the blatant Latin language too. The memory of Clongowes however which is the most bitter one and which is associated with Father Conmee most {U 190.1, 561.15-27), is how he once, "held out in the air his trembling hand with the palm upwards. . . . [The] burning pain made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers... the beaten swollen red 163</page><page sequence="14">dened mass of palm and fingers. . ." (P'50-51), and later Rector Conmee's "cool moist palm" (P 58.4). Strange "Strange but true/' says Martin Cunningham (U 246.25), using as trite a phrase as you can find anywhere, and yet one that immediately leads to another clich? which is often varied in FW (109.32, 279 F35, 336.20). The poem is by Bloom's favorite poet, Byron. Stanza 100 at the end of Canto 14 contains a philosophical digression with a thought that could be Bloomian, "But great things spring from little.. . . " The last two stanzas happen to formulate similar attitudes and seem to phrase various concerns of the novel: Tis strange, ? but true; for truth is always strange; Stranger than fiction: if it could be told, How much would novels gain by the exchange! How differently the world would men behold! How oft would vice and virtue places change! The new world would be nothing to the old, If some Columbus of the moral seas Would show mankind their soul's antipodes. What 'antres vast and deserts idle' then Would be discover'd in the human soul! What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men, With self-love in the centre as their pole! What Anthropophagi are nine or ten Of those who hold the kingdom in control! Were things but only call'd by their right name, Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame. [Don Juan, Canto 14, ci-ii) It may be a case of "coincidences.. .preindicative" (please check U 675.35). Episcopal Moves At one moment in 'Wandering Rocks" John Howard Parnell "trans lated a white bishop quietly" (U 248.22), the odd word being "trans lated," which is deprived of its contemporary figurative senses and reduced to its primary meaning, movement from one place to another. Motion along a surface is precisely what the chapter concentrates upon: the game of chess provides a suitable epitome. The verb gives the sentence both a neutral, objective, "IthacaMike ring and makes it 164</page><page sequence="15">slightly absurd: the semantic regression upsets the even pace of the telling and seems to substitute a sudden mild dislocation of time for the characteristic linkage of synchronous remote events. But the jarring note is of course that live bishops, when moved from one see to another, are, in ecclesiastical terminology, also "translated" (which, incidentally, is a weighty matter and needs the consent of the Pope). One association is that, in the view of many Irish, Parnell's great brother was removed at the instigation of the clergy; the Christmas dinner scene in A Portrait is full of words, good or bad, ac cording to faction, about "the bishops of Ireland." And then there is the old joke that a bishop is the only thing that doesn't lose in transla tion. You will appreciate that one more if you try to render Joyce's sentence into another language, trying to retain the bishop: all you probably get is a displacement of sorts. Now if you translate a bishop into English, you get "overseer" or "overlooker" (from episkopos). And this would be an objective surface description of John Howard Parnell in relation to the chessboard on which his gaze hangs. This is practically stated, a few pages later, when a mass of forms darkens the chessboard "whereon" he "looked intently" (U 253.24; emphasis added). He doesn't greatly care, however, for whatever overseeing his office entails. We know in fact that he is not where he ought to be ("Where was the marshal... to keep order in the council chamber?"? U 247.17), but has transferred himself to a spot of his own choice. On his way he was seen by Bloom, whose guess was right: "Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess there" (U 165.15). And Bloom immediately applies the idea: "His brother used men as pawns." This comparison goes back at least to Carlyle in Sartor Resar tus: "Councillors of state sit plotting and playing their high chess^game whereof the pawns are men" (Bk. I, ch. 3), but the phrase of course is common enough. And common also are pawnbrokers and pawned books in "Wandering Rocks," only those are different pawns, pledges, quite unconnected with chess pieces whose name derives from Latin pedo and pes, foot, suggestive of the way of locomotion of most peo ple in the chapter. A game of chess can be determined by a little pawn of limited move ment or a bishop of wider range. We can move around the pieces too: Charles Stewart was deposed by bishops, but moved pawns: John Howard moves a bishop. And finally there is the transferential grace note that as City Marshal he was also, ex officio, "Registrar of Pawnbrokers." "Now piawn to bishop's forthe! Moove" (FW 377.14). 165</page><page sequence="16">High Stakes ? Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere (U 325.31). Even in disappointment Lenehan, cadger and borrower of drinks, cigarettes, money or words, does not refrain from quoting. The proto type of his remark is the exultant declaration made by Captain Dennis O'Kelly at Epsom, May 3, 1769, after his horse had outdistanced the field: "Eclipse first, the rest nowhere" (Annals of Sporting, ii, 271). Eclipse, foaled in 1764 (on April 1 and named after an eclipse of the sun which occurred that day), won 18 races from May 3, 1769, until October 1770, and was never beaten. His skeleton is preserved and, in his honor, the Eclipse Stakes were inaugurated in 1884. This is the race, coming up in July 1904, for which Bello Cohen considers enter ing Bloom (at U 534.21). Information about the most celebrated horse, probably, in the an nals of the turf can be found in most reference books and encyclo paedias. If you think that this particular horse does not deserve im plicit immortality in Ulysses too, you should listen to Macaulay (who could draw up cross-cultural parallels as well as the next man): Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakespeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them. Eclipse is first, and the rest nowhere. (Thomas Babington Macaulay, "Samuel Johnson," in Critical and Historical Essays [London: Dent, 19071, p. 538). Ramifications The Tree Wedding in the "Cyclops" chapter of Ulysses, interpolated as a lush outgrowth of John Wyse Nolan's plea to "reafforest" Ireland and mediated by a plain reading of "the conifer family" (U 326.35), ac commodates company of mixed descent. The lineage of the invited guests will still have to be traced. So far Robert Schoies has given us some up-to-date terminology for the capricious patterns of the list, its dependence on "syntagmatic expectation" and "paradigmatic excur sion" (JJQ, 10 [Fall 1972], 169). Here I offer merely a few odd glances. There was, at least, one societal benefit that Joyce could get out of his dendronymous arabesque: it easily fitted a number of his female acquaintances into the novel, after the fact, as seems to have been the 166</page><page sequence="17">occasion when a fresh copy was inspected in a Paris restaurant on February 2, 1922. Simply on the strength of their first names, a Helen, a Lillian, and a Dorothy could be shown to be in Ulysses (// 539). Another woman, also present according to Ellmann's account, Helen Kief fer, might easily have suggested the associations: German Kiefer means pine tree. In the list first names bear a disproportionate weight, disproportionate with regard to Dublin usage in 1904: newspapers and especially Thorn's Directory relegate all but a few women to Mrs. or Miss (even Misses, collectively) without any hint of an individual name. We know of Hugh Boylan's bold departure from that custom. One suspects ?and I would be surprised if this hadn't been pointed out before somewhere ? that Joyce is also paying a slanted tribute to his publisher and unsparing assistant in the hectic days of proof reading and additions,1 Sylvia Beach and her family: she was daughter of the Reverend Sylvester Woodbridge Beach; her sisters were Holly and Cyprian. Miss Beach, however, remained a spinster. The twenty-nine wedding guests, forerunners of a lunar and per haps floral cycle in Finnegans Wake, have common arboreal stock, but different status (some seem to be engaged in social climbing) and linguistic genealogy: all seem to join gleefully in the Cyclopian trickery of naming, a fluctuation between nouns and names. A few look like nominal incarnations of set phrases, of likely predicates; one at least derives from a song, another from an opera. Mrs. Barbara Lovebirch is related to an author of sado-masochistic novels* (U 235.38). The scene is an ideal setting for a Greek nymph to be remetempsychosed into contemporary society as Daphne Bays ? "Miss," of course (in fact introduced as the first of all the Misses to be mentioned), as though still true to her vow of virginity (see Ovid, Metamorphoses I, 486-87, and U 65.20). If you want, Daphne Bays is simply a translation from Greek daphne to English laurel (bay): we can ?but do not have to ? anchor this to a Homeric line in the Cyclops encounter: "daphn?si katerephes" (Od. 9:183: the cave was "overhung with laurels"), a little later a small cluster of firs and oaks is worked in (9:186). Translations are transformations, and both abound (compare also Wood, Forrest, Sylvester, etc.). Ovid, however, is reversed: here trees and shrubs are metamorphosed into human beings. I submit two more pseudo-identifications from opposite poles. One is the only wife in the list who is referred to by the name of her hus band, not her own: Mrs. Clyde Twelvetrees. Clyde Twelvetrees is the actual name of the cellist who, on the very day, starting at 7:15 p.m. (i.e., in less than two hours), was accompanying Mrs. Mary Anderson in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, being toured by Louis Werner (U 93.3-8).2 167</page><page sequence="18">Also appearing on the same program was "Wm. Ludwig. ? Basso" (see U 636.34). Mrs. Helen Vinegadding's origins, on the other hand, are mainly literary. Milton describes woods and desert caves: "With Wilde Thyme and the gadding Vine o'regrown (Lycidas, 40), and goes on to "Willows, and the Hazle Copses green" and "White Thorn." We need the aid of a botanist for more family tree lore to come to light. Miss Priscilla Elderflower sounds both wallflowery and vaguely biblical: one Priscilla gets some honorable, but casual, salutes in St. Paul's letters (St. Paul's pronouncements on the role of women have been quoted at many a wedding ceremony), and Judas hanged himself on the unlucky elder tree (as William Langland and William Shakespeare claimed). Since the marriage, within the chapter, is ostensibly launched in order to increase and multiply the trees and shrubs of Ireland, it is odd for the wedding to take place, or so it seems, in France, the church of Saint Fiacre, in spite or because of the Citizen's contempt for the French, those traditionally or potentially staunch allies of the Irish cause (U 330). There may be some such church in Ireland as well as in France (and in Paris there is both a rue and an impasse Saint-Fiacre). The saint himself set a precedent by taking off to France and staying there to become a French hermit and, ultimately, a vehicle. Perhaps one implication is that trees, like writers (remember dendrophile Shem in the Wake), are better off on the continent. The newly wed couple, at any rate, instantly take off, after the ceremony, even farther away from Ireland, to the Black Forest in the east (the route may be re motely parallel to the one taken by an unwed couple from Dublin to Paris, Z?rich, and Trieste). That Saint Fiacre's church should be singled out for a ceremony which includes no fewer than 32 women, as against only the groom and the bride's father, may be an act of retribution, for the saint was very strict in "excluding women from his own enclosure,3 and stories are told of the misfortunes that befell those who trespassed, even after his death," as the Penguin Dictionary of Saints (Harmondsworth, 1965, p. 131) sums up many hagiographical accounts. The saint, in the French language, became the name for a thing, a "hackney coach," as it is commonly rendered, a word which in turn can be brought in to characterize a certain kind of language as it is used in many of the interpolations in "Cyclops." Saint Fiacre, oblig ingly onomaturgic, is well placed in a chapter which glorifies such semantic transactions, and he deserves mention in two catalogues, the 168</page><page sequence="19">other ecclesiastical (339.28ff), soon after the functional saints of the chapter (U 339.21-23). The bridegroom, John Wyse Nolan, who is already married (U 177.28), originally arrived in Barney Kiernan's pub with news about the Irish language, which was instantly contrasted with "patois" (U 324). It is all the more strange that the polyglossal foliage does not seem to contain any Gaelic element. If we compare the frequency of Irish words for trees (and they also serve as letters) in Finnegans Wake, the omission looks almost pointedly intentional, as though to reiterate a point already made. We know of course that when Irish is actually spoken (as at U 14), as against merely clamored for in patriotic display, it can easily be taken for French. So when Nolan ? at his entrance even O'Nolan, with tidings of "the winged speech of the seadivided Gael," which is "on the march" (1/324.39-41) ?is gallicized into chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, one may derive some nuptial glee from the (unchanged) name of the bride, Miss Fir4 Conifer of Pine Valley as though containing some suggestive French lewdness. Trans lators, in their turn, have amusing scope with the passage and tend to make good use of it when they adapt the wedding party into their own language. That Bloom, alias lover Henry Flower, and generally lover of trees (vide his suburban dreams at U 714), should be translated into Senhor Enrique Flor, a citizen of Portugal which has been marked out as treeless, looks like another insult. A further taunt, in tune with the at mosphere in the public house/is that he presides at the organ with his well-known ability: we know that the chapter makes him an expert on, but not a practitioner of, organ (U 305.6, 319.27ff). None of the insertions in the "Cyclops" chapter seems to have been given much detailed attention ("insertion," like "Interpolation" or "aside," is a relatively neutral term: there are also question-begging ones like "parodies," etc.). Yet a study of their structural dynamics might be profitable. Before we could undertake it we would probably need many more observations of the sort given above. The "simple" Tree Wedding, on the surface also just a take-off on the style of society newspapers, proves remarkably complex. Yet one more off shoot of the narrative, it grew out of, presumably, a few scenic descriptions in the Odyssey (around 9:186), topical Irish concerns, some chance remarks in conversation, creative exuberance finding a botanical form, the garden of Eden, mythology, the metamorphotic power of figurative speech (a word like "family" is taken at face value and elaborated just as, later on, "bless," which branches out into an ec clesiastical benediction with ceremonious trappings, (U 338-40), and 169</page><page sequence="20">literary precedents, etc. Analogous to the Tree Wedding, Ulysses as a whole amalgamates figures from Dublin "reality," fictional characters, rhetorical personifications, and numerous transferences. What if we also saw it as Joyce's response to what Arthur Symons, for one, told English readers the Symbolists were after? They, also French, banished description. "And as we brush aside the accidents of daily life, in which men and women imagine that they are alone touching reality, we come closer to humanity. . . . " Well, Joyce did not have to brush aside the accidents of daily life; in fact he began by accumulating them and making them, if anything, even more acciden tal (stressing daily objects like "brush" very early), and yet did achieve effects which can be termed symbolic. And so the non-realistic vegeta tion within the account of Nolan's nuptials might strike us as Joyce's dissentient comment on the one instance which Symons singled out for what he thought outmoded: "we are coming closer to nature, as we seem to shrink from it with something of horror, disdaining to catalogue the trees of the forest."5 We moreover have an imitation of the Greek anthropomorphic tendency: the Greeks humanized gods, plants, constellations, abstrac tions. Which is precisely what Homer, according to Berard, did to the Semitic material that he adapted: "He borrows his themes but shapes them in the Greek manner, endowing them with anthropomorphic life.... The Hellene is, first and foremost, a skilled arranger."6 Notice that Enrique Flor, in our passage, is playing "a new and striking ar rangement" (U 327.29), while Joyce is quietly Hellenizing a non existing Irish forest. Most likely there are also anthropological roots. Tree weddings were practiced by the Hindoos. Read any encyclopaedia on "Tree Marriage" and rites to secure the continuity of group life, fertility, and kindred subjects. The most important tree in the areas mentioned is the mango which is not featured at the wedding, but elsewhere in the chapter flourishes exceedingly (U 334.37). Just imagine what the passage would be like in the light of the views which Robert Graves puts forth in his White Goddess, where the fir tree, the first in the Irish alphabet: ailm, is also the name for the palm tree, which links up with phoinix and the Phoenicians, all of which would make our bride a near equivalent of Anna Livia.... But according to Joyces namesake, P.W. Joyce, the Irish did not particularly indulge in the veneration of trees; this was a characteristic of the Gaulish druids ? perhaps another reason for leaving things to France, where they order this matter better, too. At the end of the twelfth century Giraldus Cambrensis (U 326.25) noted that Ireland 170</page><page sequence="21">was well-wooded. There was even a hierarchical system of trees; the Brehon laws divided them into four classes: "1. 'Chieftain' trees: oak, hazel, holly, yew, ash, pine, apple; 2. 'Common' trees: alder, willow, hawthorn, mountain-ash, or rowan-tree, or quicken-tree, birch, elm; 3. 'Shrub' trees: blackthorn, elder, white hazel, aspen. ..; 4. Bramble trees: fern, bog, myrtle, furze, briar, heath, ivy, broom, gooseberry."7 In this perspective, Joyce's assembly looks reasonably mixed and democratic. The point is, of course, the multiplicity of sources and points of view. When Joyce grew up, anthropologists and comparatists were busy tracing origins and came up with many theories, some of them very reductive. But collectively they came up with cultural cross references, explaining everything in terms of something else. If we claim privileged status for the sources of our own taste, we become Cyclopically monocular. So Joyce's dryadic flourish, in anticipation of exfoliations in the Wake, might also be taken as a warning against pompous p?trifications.

Speaking of families, English "fir" is not at all related, in spite of superficial resemblance, to Latin "conifer." 5 Arthur Symons, The Symbolist Movement in Literature, ed., Richard Ellmann (New York: Dutton, 1958), p. 5. 6 Stuart Gilbert's rendering of Victor B?rard's views in James Joyce's "Ulysses" (Lon don: Faber and Faber, 1952), pp. 86-87. 7 P.W.

(U 424.20), has so far thwarted commentators. It was Mr. Gerard OTlaherty in Dublin who pointed out to me a source. It is a reprint of a paper read before the Irish National Literary Society, April 27, 1893, first published 1894 and now again made available. The author, PJ. McCall, offers historical associations about the area around Swift's cathedral. McCall discusses the exploits and the death 171</page><page sequence="22">of Dr. John Whalley, notorious quack, star gazer, and almanac com piler (see FW 536.32, 601.34), whose house in Patrick street later, . . .was converted into an inn, which, at the beginning of the century, was owned by the popular Sir Timothy O'Brien. The worthy baronet appears to have been an eccentric character in his way, and among a certain class of his customers (before he resigned his retail for a wholesale store) he was invariably known as "The Knight of the Battered Naggin," recalling Cervantes' Knight of the Golden Basin in Don Quixote. This cognomen of Sir Tim had reference to the dilapidated conditions of his pewter measures by means of which, his customers asserted, the niggard landlord saved a goodly amount of the precious liquor {In the Shadow of St. Patrick's, facsimile edition with introduction by Thomas Wall [Blackrock: Carraig Books, 1976], p. 26). This helps quite a bit and, at one remove, weaves a literary thread into the texture of a chapter which also purports to be a history of prose styles. But even so it is up to the reader, once more, to find, speculate upon, or make up a context. What may well have happened is that the name became locally proverbial for any miserly landlord; or else there was a particular Dublin publican to whom a wit attached the tag; or it might have stuck to a name, or the place. It is parenthetically amusing to see that the question, "Where you slep las nigh?," has the same battered appearance as Bloom's high grade hat. And Bloom has a sharp eye for defective hats (U 115.21). From the same source a faint shadow of a non-identity emerges in the person of "a Scotchman named M'Intosh," who rented a store at the rear of a house in Patrick street, "on behalf of Robert Emmet, to be used as a depot for rockets and grenades, and for the manufacture of powder." By some means or other, an associate ". . .while making rockets, let a spark fall on some gunpowder, and an explosion took place. This soon brought Major Sirr on the spot, who arrested a number of people.... M'Intosh made an important statement, in con sequence of which Major Sirr repaired to M'Intosh's residence, where he discovered a concealed door.... Upon opening this door a tier of closet room appeared, communicating by trap doors and scaling lad ders . . . the Major discovered from 300 to 400 pikes of a peculiar con struction ... a quantity of sulphur.... John M'Intosh, lately convicted of high treason, was executed in Patrick Street, opposite the depot of which he had charge. . .(pp. 42-43). A mysterious, shady character, accomplice rebel, traitor and, perhaps, an informer. All this means is that there were associations to the name of M'In tosh. Realistically they have nothing to do with the unidentified char acter in Ulysses to whom the name gets accidentally affixed. But in "Circe" he becomes the victim of an execution. And observe his stage entrance and the particular charge he levels against Bloom: 172</page><page sequence="23">{A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trapdoor. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.) THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser (U 485.8-15). Classical idiom Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero (U 640.35; see also 658.23, 660.25). Antiquity has handed down a store of similes and analogies to be summoned on demand. The one above is post-Homerical; what may not be known, but probably expected, is its earlier application to the political situation. The Oxford Dictionary of English Quotations lists Coleridge (Friend 431): "Ireland, that vulnerable heel of the British Achilles" (p. 289). The Kitty O'Shea Touch Joyce would hardly have passed up reading Katherine O'Shea's, later Mrs. Parnell's, memoirs of her lover and husband. Richard Ellmann lists Charles Stewart Parnell (London: Cassell, 1914) among Joyce's books (The Consciousness of Joyce, p. 122); the book was re printed in 1924 and again in 1973 (which edition is used here). Herbert Howarth has perceptively dealt with the possible impact of the book on Joyce and, in particular, on Ulysses. Howarth even suggests Joyce may have begun to sketch "Eumaeus" after reading the memoirs in 1914 (The Irish Writers [New York: Hill and Wang, 1958], pp. 292ff.). Kitty O'Shea is indeed featured in "Eumaeus" more than in any other chapter (a delusive namesake of hers finds her way into "Penelope" ? U 751). The episode of Parnell's attempt to regain control over United Ireland in 1890, during which his hat was lost, is mentioned in her book; but she admits she had to use a "witness's account" contained in Barry O'Brien's Life of Charles Stewart Parnell. John Henry Raleigh used both sources in his Chronicle of Leopold and Molly Bloom (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1977), pp. 114-17. "Eumaeus" has much to do with matters "of strict history" (U 654.42), with facts and fictions, with the reliability of witnesses and documents, with the chanciness of reports. The incident with Parnell's 173</page><page sequence="24">hat is based, partly, on the recollections of a widow who was not, however, on the spot and had to rely on a printed source which she rephrased for her memoirs. Joyce improves on this unsatisfactory situation by sneaking in as an eyewitness and marginal participant Leopold Bloom, a wholly fictional hero, but a relisher of vicinities and an enjoyer of the distinction of being close to the uncrowned king (U 653.39, 654.20), so as to observe events at close range. He is, generally, a good observer. Joyce's spurious eyewitness obliges, auto parallactically, with two reports given in quick succession, the two mainly overlapping and, like history, repeating themselves, but also a trifle divergent. As soon as we have two or more accounts of the same occurrence the repetitions become less important than the disparities: these may be of detail (the "silk" hat), or of more pertinence. Did or didn't Parnell add "sir" to his "Thank youl One might suspect Bloom would remember the exact address at such a unique encounter. Is the Sir in the second version just an embellishment meant to impress? And what was Parnell's expression? ?"frigid," or was he "panting"? Not that the two accounts would have to be incompatible. Katherine O'Shea had added another aspect: "He had lost his hat, his hair was tumbled, his eyes were filled with the wild joy of the battle" (p. 296). The last item shows how literary elaboration can push factual descrip tion into the background. Bloom's "excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression" (U 650.4) similarly, but more mutedly, mixes interpretation with reporting: "undoubtedly" ?a very Eumaean word ?signals not the absence of, but some potential cause for doubt: you say "undoubtedly" when you don't really know but have strong reasons for assuming. In nice acknowledgement of the widow who remembers without having been on the spot to perceive, but filled her husband's eyes with literary clich?, Joyce has Bloom think that she "was the first to perceive" the fallen idol's feet of clay (U 654.37). Stereotype can get in the way of and replace perception. Mrs. Parnell's memoirs furnished some model examples. Herbert Howarth discussed the effect of the public confession of her husband's foibles on Yeats and Joyce. But the devoted widow was probably most damaging when she was giving loving shape to the idol. Take a typical scene when, with the divorce pending, the lovers were in their Brighton home and she, suffering from pain, "broke down and cried" out of fear for his work. So he, in trying to soothe and comfort her, used the following homely words which she quotes verbatim (that is within quotation marks): "Queenie," he went on, "put away all fear and regret for my public life. I have given, and will give, Ireland what is in me to give. That I have vowed to her, but 174</page><page sequence="25">my private life shall never belong to any country, but to one woman. There will be a howl, but it will be the howl of hypocrites; not altogether, for some of these Irish fools are genuine in their belief that forms and creeds can govern life and men.... But I am not as they, for they are among the world's children.... What the ultimate government of Ireland will be is settled, and it will be so, and what my share in the work has been and is to be, also. I do wish you would stop fret ting about me? We know nothing of how or why, but only that we love one another, and that through all the ages is the one fact that cannot be forgotten or put aside by us." (pp. 282-83). That kind of idiom (for a home in which otherwise we find tea and toast and a few remarks about socks) would do well at Westminster, or for that matter in the "Aeolus" chapter. The recollections are the kind of stuff that also finds voice in poems like the one Hynes recites in "Ivy Day." One wonders what Mrs. Marion Bloom would reply to such a forensic display. So Kitty O'Shea might have contributed, in spirit, at any rate, to "Aeolus" and "Eumaeus" as a model of style too. The last words of her book ? "The last words Parnell spoke were given to the wife who had never failed him, to the love that was stronger than death ?'Kiss me, sweet Wifie, and I will try to sleep a little'" (p. 335) ?prove that she could have taken a shot at "Nausicaa" too. Possibly a word from her exalted preface, "one of Parnell's erstwhile followers" (William O'Brien, p. vii), is taken over into a related passage: "his erstwhile staunch adherents"; "the O'Brienite scribes,... reflecting on the erst while tribune's private morals" (U 651.32, 654.30). Naturally it is not possible, nor even very much to the point,1 to trace single words and phrases which are part of a common stock to potential sources; the characteristic of that ornate language is pre cisely its general availability and interchangeability. History, where it looks most factual, can be fabled from reports (in newspapers, memoirs) which are often written to conform to expecta tions?what family members choose to perpetuate, what friends or enemies want to project. Joyce's fiction incorporates such stylizations. Charles Stewart Parnell, "Dedicated to Love," may have become a bit of a source, but it was certainly a good example. Mrs. Parnell, fine lump of a woman, helped to inspire "Eumaeus" and perhaps suggested specific details in a novel in which her husband is assisted by a char acter whose existence is purely verbal. She had one touch which would have fitted so well that its use would have struck us readers as too heavy-handedly conspicuous. When Parnell and his faithful rushed into the printing works, there was a fight "between garrison and besiegers." Kitty O'Shea: "The rest was a Homeric struggle.. ." (p. 296). 175</page><page sequence="26">NOTES 1 Still it is always vacuously fascinating to wonder about coincidental echoes. O'Shea's epigraph to the last chapter is a stanza from an "Old Ballad," and it bears some superficial resemblance to Stephen's poem on the beach, which is quoted in full in "Aeolus" (U 48; 132), and to its antecedent, Douglas Hyde's "My Grief to the Sea": O gentle wind that bloweth south To where my love repaireth, Convey a kiss to his dear mouth And tell me how he fareth (312). Wind, kiss, love, south, mouth? "Is the mouth south someway?. . . Must be some" {U 138.20). Aquiline Flutter If Stephen were to cultivate his tenor voice and exploit it, he might, in Bloom's managerial vision, become a great success in society and cause "a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex" (U 664.2). Like so many phrases in "Eumaeus" which are not direct quotations, this one too may boast of noble ancestry, most likely not known to Bloom. Coriolanus (see U 208.30) brags in his final scene: If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli (Coriolanus V, v [vi], 114). Stephen as an eagle ?this would once have fitted his adolescent ambi tions. It fitted Joyce's juvenile ones, to judge from his composition on the death of Parnell; apart from its Shakespearean title, "Et Tu, Healy" (adapted from another one of the Roman plays), Stanislaus Joyce remembered only three lines, the first of which is "His quaint-perched aerie on the crags of Time" (My Brother's Keeper [London: Faber, 1958], p. 65). In A Portrait, a chronicle of flaps and flutters, the eagle doubles with another Daedalian bird in the famous ecstatic scene on the beach (". . . the cry of a hawk or eagle on high. . . " ? P 169.27). In Ulysses the royal bird is featured in a heraldic boost by Stephen's father: "Simon Dedalus. . .An eagle gules volant" (U572.16). Much is made of it too in Finnegans Wake, and even more, perhaps, of the smallest bird, the wren, who is also "king of all birds": the wren is connected, of course, with St. Stephen. In Ulysses, however, "flutter" has acquired a few erotic overtones ? "the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen" (U 176</page><page sequence="27">350.35); "a little flutter in polite debauchery" (1/655.40). So there is a shift from political or artistic eminence: it is typical of Bloom that he would apply the image of the warrior to the lover. What Bloom cannot know is that Stephen has already had his Icarian flutter in at least one drawing room where he sang to the girl whose heart was willful as a bird's, but he withdrew. And when she was later looking at him "out of dove's eyes," she was in company of a priest, a Roman eagle, who knows? (P 216.36, 219.9-220.6). In the corresponding much longer scene of the earlier draft (SH 42-47), Bloom's advice is nearly anticipated by the girls' father: "Mr Daniel said that Stephen should sing operatic music if he wanted to have his voice heard properly" (SH 43.10). But the analogy is not too happy anyway. The defiant stand of Cor iolanus ?in character not too different from Stephen's behavior towards the two soldiers in "Circe" ?does not occur at the height of some success, social or amatory, but moments before he is killed by conspirators and the crowd. Killed by the sword, but figuratively ? "Tear him to pieces," shout "All the People" (line 121) ?in exactly the way that Parnell met his end, as Joyce put it: "they tore him to pieces themselves" (CW 228). So Bloom, who has had his thoughts on Parnell and Irish loyalty in the chapter, is paying a somewhat am bivalent tribute. Someone has yet to tell us where Joyce, incipient poet at the age of almost ten, cribbed that metaphorical eagle from, "His quaint-perched aerie on the crags of Time." The source must have been well-known once; a writer hardly ever compared to Joyce, P.G. Wodehouse, played with the same phrase. "I have got to get to a place where I can be alone," says one character, "alone with my dreams and visions. Some little eyrie perched on the cliffs of Time" (Leave It To Psmith [1923; rpt. Harmondsworth: Penguin], p. 170). Wodehouse, come to think of it, got a good deal of stylistic mileage out of the comic ac cumulation of literary stereotype, in many ways not unlike the dis cordances of "Eumaeus." Electricity in Horticulture Of the topics of conversation in "Ithaca" listed right at the begin ning, some have the true ring of Bloomian interests, like "the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoin ing paraheliotropic trees" (U 666.16). This particular interest may have been revived by a short entry in 177</page><page sequence="28">the newspaper which both Bloom and Stephen have been looking at a while ago, the Evening Telegraph of June 16, "Last Pink." There, on the first page, right-hand column (Bloom was sitting on Stephen's right), under a heading "Gleaned From All Sources," were a few tid bits, one bearing the title of this note. It is about "some queer things which happen to flowers when they are exposed to the electric light.... Violets are doubled or trebled in size.... Rose bushes have been converted into trees and vines, bearing flowers in clusters like grapes. In a modern plant experimental laboratory the electric light arc creates transformations that astonish the most hardened investi gators. Reds are converted into purples, and blacks and whites into all the colours of the rainbow Such transformations are surprising enough to be tested in reality. And so perhaps the sight of gaslamps and suburban vegetation in the Dublin streets may have induced speculation and a question to the young man of learning whose acquaintance Bloom has just made. Whatever happens to flowers and rose bushes, our two investigators are agreed, for once, that paraheliotropic trees are not affected by gaslight or electric light.</page></plain_text>
