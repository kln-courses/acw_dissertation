<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prophecies of Jeremiah The Prophecies of Jeremiah Psychoanalytic discussions of the prophets are fewer than of any other part of the Old Testament. Both the texts and the nature of the prophets' experiences are obscure. In my view, the obscurity of the texts arises from undue reli ance on philological methods. Interdisciplinary competence in the psychology of religious experiences, long resisted by professional Old Testament critics, is, I suggest, a conditio sine qua non for the scientific study of prophetic literature. Despite the scepticism of modern critics, the authentic ity of Jeremiah's prophecies is not in doubt. Jeremiah's prophecies were "known" before they became manifest. Je remiah indeed foretold a remarkable series of historical events. How this is to be explained—whether through ran dom chance, extra-sensory perception (7), or divine revela tion—one cannot say. Freud states that "there is at least one spot in every dream at which it is unplumbable—a navel, as it were, that is its point of contact with the unknown" (10, p. Ill, n. 1). In developing a phenomenology of Jeremiah's experi ences as a data base for analysis, I will follow the manifest content in writing of "Yahweh." All translations are from the Hebrew, in the light of the textual criticism of Old Tes tament scholarship. A. R. Johnson (26) suggests that, originally, the various Hebrew terms for "prophet" had distinct meanings. In early use, ro'eh, "seer," primarily denoted a visionary, although a seer, such as Samuel, also "foreheard" auditory phenomena. Hozeh, by contrast, was used to designate ecstatics whose ex periences were predominantly locutions; but the exact sense is unclear. Nabi early indicated a "frenzied" diviner. In later use, nabi came to supplant both ro'eh and hozeh as the general term for "prophet." To Johnson's list must be added ish ha American Imago, Spring 1985, Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 1-37.

Overmuch reliance should not to be placed, however, on the philology; the unique features of Israelite prophet ism are obscured by comparative Semitics. In Israel, the various terms for prophets had popular use in keeping with general Semitic practice, on the socio logical criterion of public oracular function. Israelite usage had also a second convention which lacked ancient Semitic parallel. Several of the prophets, from the legendary Moses through the historical Jeremiah and Malachi, discriminated true and false among sociologically-defined prophets on cri teria generally regarded today as theological. As Jeremiah's explicit remarks make plain, the criteria were theological only because they were first psychological. 14:14 And Yah weh said to me: It is a lie that the prophets prophesy in My name. I did not send them, and I did not command them, and I did not speak to them. A lying locution, and divination, and deification, and the deceits of their hearts, they self-prophesy for themselves. 23:16 So says Yahweh of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the prophets that prophesy for you. They confound you. They speak a locution of their hearts, not from the mouth of Yahweh. I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in My name, saying: "I have dreamed! I have dreamed!" Until when? Is it [known] in the heart? The prophets are prophets of the lie, and prophets of the deceits of their hearts. 23:25 23:26</page><page sequence="3">Prophecies of Jeremiah 3 In Israelite, as in Egyptian idiom, what we term the psyche was known as the heart. When Jeremiah decried locutions and dream-like visions as "deceits of the heart" and conjugated the verb to prophesy as "to self-prophesy," he was asserting that auto-suggestion characterized the ec stasies which he denied to be truly prophecies. In 23:26a, he noted that the specification of an alleged futurity is not contained within a vision's images. All experiences to which Jeremiah objected were varieties of religious trance. "Religious trance" is a historian's term that encompasses the well-known, broad range of hallucinations, delusions, obsessions, compulsions, conversion symptoms, etc., that have religious valuations in the mysticisms of the higher religions, and in shamanic seances, spirit possessions, spirit mediumships, etc., of primitive religions. Religious trances are, for the most part, either hetero- or self-hypnotic phenomena, or auto-suggestively altered hysteria (1). Contrary to common assumption, prophecy in the ex perience of Jeremiah—he also cites Moses, Samuel, David, and Elijah—was a distinct phenomenon. For the most part, the prophecies of Jeremiah consisted of the inspirations of discrete verbal ideations that were culturally interpreted as revelations by Yahweh, "He causes existing" (1, Vol. 1, pp. 248-60). The limitation of Jeremiah's prophecies for psychologi cal study is their theological orientation. Jeremiah pre served what he thought important for religious, rather than for psychological, purposes. Prophetic experiences were not spontaneous but had to be sought. 33:2 So says Yahweh, the maker of the earth, who fashions it to establish it —Yahweh is His name—: 33:3 Call to Me, and I shall answer thee, and tell thee great tidings and obscurities thou didst not know. Jeremiah did not discuss how prophetic states were at tained, unless the following verse alludes to a use of ergot.</page><page sequence="4">4 Daniel Merkur 23:28 The prophet who has a dream, will tell a dream, but he who has My word will speak words of truth. What for straw is the wheat? says Yahweh? The historical background of Jeremiah's career is given in his book and in II Kings 22-25. Josiah, king of Judah, undertook extensive religious reforms on what were believed to be Mosaic principles. During his reign, possibly in dissatis faction with the reforms, Jeremiah first prophesied the fall of Judah and Jerusalem. At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah was tried on charges of the capital crime of false prophecy, but was acquitted by the clan leaders of the populace. Later, Jeremiah interfered with the ritual human sacrifices in the Vale of Hinnoam. He was beaten and put in stocks overnight on charges of being a madman. Thereafter, Jeremiah began to prophesy against specific priests and the royal family. In the fourth year of his reign, Jehoiakim—and the Levant as far as Egypt—was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. Jeremiah, a priest by profession, was denied further access to the temple. He wrote a copy of all his prophecies—some of them by now fulfilled—and engaged a fellow priest named Baruch to convey them to Jehoiakim. Because the prophecies included Jehoiakim's death, Jehoiakim gave orders for Jeremiah's execution. Jeremiah and Baruch went into hiding. Following the prophesied death of Jehoiakim and the captivity of his successor Jehoiachin, Jeremiah re-entered Judan public life, apparently after six years of hiding. His preaching against the false prophecies of his rivals resumed, as did his foretelling of doom for the nation. Jeremiah es caped both prison and captivity and became a major figure in the defeated remnants of the Judan community. The Sight of the Potter (18:1-8) Here are some general features of Jeremiah's proph ecy. Points of psychological interest in chs. 18-19 are con fined to the opening verses.</page><page sequence="5">Prophecies of Jeremiah 5 18:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying: 18:2 "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear My words." 18:3 So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel. 18:4 And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do. 18:5 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying: 18:6 "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done?" says Yahweh. "Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel. 18:7 If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, 18:8 and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it." The potter's house, the potter, his clay, and his pots were real sense perceptions. There was no hallucination in volved on Jeremiah's part. That the potter spoiled a pot and reworked the clay into another were specified as coinciden tal, occurring "as it seemed good to the potter to do" (25, p. 99). For Jeremiah, the same real events, unrelated to him self, took on symbolic meaning. The implications of the symbol are expressed in verbal ideation. Even the ideation was described as symbolic. Jeremiah expressly employed the passive: "the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh.... Then the word of Yahweh came to me." The words were simply words that came to Jeremiah. The importance of the words arose, not from the fact of their inspiration, but from what they said. The symbolic character of both the real potter and the verbal ideation indicates pseudo-hallucination. Jere miah knew that these were fantasies, but he regarded them as revelations of truth that occurred through the</page><page sequence="6">6 Daniel Merkur medium of fantasy. Reality testing is implicit. Yah weh gave Jeremiah a command, but Jeremiah went to the pot ter's house on his own volition. The potter worked "as it seemed good to the potter to do." Jeremiah's very prophecy of Yahweh's intervention in the future of Israel explained its own contingency on an uninterrupted con tinuation of Israel's free will to do evil or to repent. For Jeremiah, the creation, including the potter's acts and the prophesied words, was a natural order through whose random coincidences divine providence was accomplished. The timing of Jeremiah's inspiration was simply one such coincidence. The problematic aspect of the passage is the initial no tice which explains that the experience was of extended duration, since words came to Jeremiah both in his home and in the potter's shop. There is an arguable quality of obsession rather than pseudo-hallucinatory inspiration in the assertion: "The word that came to Jeremiah from Yah weh, saying: Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear My words." However, these verses present other difficulties as well. Because Jeremiah first hears words in the potter's house, he seems to imply that these earlier words, which did come to him, were words that he could not hear. The solution to the paradox is simple. Biblical Hebrew has no word for "idea," nor any way to differentiate unconscious from conscious thought. By unheard words of command, Jeremiah would seem to be describing, in the language available to him, an unconscious prompting that motivated him to descend to the potter's house. Only after he watched the potter and began to hear prophetic words consciously did he re-interpret his prior motivation as having been divinely inspired. There is then no evidence of any inhibition of reality testing. Rather, there is a considerably astute grasp of psychology for the 6th century BCE. Jeremiah's Call (1:1-12) The account of Jeremiah's call establishes him as a "son" or, in modern idiom, a follower of the Hilkianic sect</page><page sequence="7">Prophecies of Jeremiah 7 of priests at Anatoth (Jer. 1:1). Tradition is mistaken in regarding the verse as evidence that Jeremiah was either a descendant of Hilkiah or a native of Anatoth. Jeremiah's sight of an almond rod (1:11) at the time of his call alludes to the miracle of Aaron's rod (Num. 17) and is a literary metaphor referring to an initiation under the tutelage of the Hilkianic priests. Reference to the initiation also occurs in a later prophecy. 15:16 Thy words were found, and I ate them; and Thy word became for me a joy and the delight of my heart; and I was called by Thy name: Yahweh of hosts. Jeremiah refers to himself as a youth at the time of his call during Josiah's reign (1:9). Some years later, early in Jehoiakim's reign, Yahweh forbade him to marry and to father children (16:Iff.). Because most kings of the period fathered sons while in their mid-teens, it is difficult to rec oncile Jeremiah's declaration, in the fourth year of Jehoia kim (25:1), that 25:3a From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, for twenty-three years, the word of Yahweh has come to me. In order to put sense of the verse, I provisionally re store the original meaning. 25:3a From (when I was) thirteen years to this day, (when I am) twenty-three years, the word of Yahweh has come to me. Jeremiah was initiated into prophecy at age thirteen, about 615 BCE. The Lesson of Responsibility (3:6-6:30) In his next recorded experience (3:6-6:30), Jeremiah does not at first trust his earlier prophecy of the evil of "all</page><page sequence="8">8 Daniel Merkur the families of the kingdoms of the north" that are to be siege Jerusalem (1:13-15). Instead, he preaches against northerners whom he identifies as "faithless Israel" (3:12), decidedly a less dangerous group. The association with the survivors of the northern kingdom is a point of departure for a prophecy of the future ingathering of Israel into Ju dah—implicitly, the completion of Josiah's reformation, then still in progress. Later, however, Yahweh states: 4:6b I bring evil from the north and great destruction. Precisely because Jeremiah had doubted his earlier assump tion of this interpretation, its recurrence is notable. We have here a "return of the renounced" prophecy of evil from the north. All of 3:6-4:12 is written in Yahweh's name and in the first person, following the literary convention of cultic proph ecy. It is impossible to differentiate actual inspiration from Jeremiah's poeticizing until the shift into the third person. 4:13 Behold! he ascends like clouds, and his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined! 4:14 Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved. Until when shall there lodge within thee thy calamitous thoughts? 4:15 For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims calamity from Mount Ephraim. 4:16 Warn the nations, "He is come!" Announce to Jerusalem, "Enemies come from the distant land; they give voice against the cities of Judah." 4:17a Like keepers of a field they are against her round about, Thus far Jeremiah. His rhetoric is extravagant. Mythic imagery portrays the enemy as a heavenly messenger (4:13a-c; 4:16a). The cry of woe and ruin (4:13d) is not seriously intended because Jeremiah fully anticipates Jeru</page><page sequence="9">Prophecies of Jeremiah 9 salem's repentance (4:14). No voice truly speaks in Dan or Ephraim. The cultic prophet merely creates a poetic image. In the next moment, a sudden inspiration changes matters profoundly. 4:18 Thy ways and thy doings have brought this upon thee. This is thy evil, that it is bitter, that it has reached thy heart. The prophecy is addressed both to Jerusalem and to Jere miah. The teenager experiences an immediate somatization (6, p. 103). 4:19a My guts! My guts! I am sickened! The walls of my heart! My heart palpitates for me! After the somatization, Jeremiah's metaphors become precise, transparent and personal (4:20-22). However, his youthful optimism informs a further argument that he has with Yah weh. Jeremiah cannot accept that matters are so bad that Judah's doom is certain. Yahweh bids him search Jerusalem for a just, truth-seeking man (5:1-2). Jeremiah replies that Yahweh's punishments occur, but because they are misunderstood, they result in no repentance (5:3). He determines instead to preach to the learned and the great (5:3-4a). Yahweh states that all alike are guilty and that he cannot but punish all (5:4b-9). Jeremiah is told to win such believers as he can, but to expect little success (5:10-13). The emotional impact of his argument with Yahweh must have been telling. A more explicit statement that the inspirations were wish-fulfilments can scarcely be expected than 5:14c, but the fulfilment was clearly less happy than Jeremiah preferred. In the remainder of the prophecy of doom (5:29-6:30), the language is changed. There are no further anthropomorphisms. Occasional images are ex travagant, but for the most part, there is intense realism. A broken-hearted Jeremiah senses the futility of his mission. 6:10 To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear?</page><page sequence="10">10 Daniel Merkur Behold! their ears are uncircumcized. They cannot pay attention. Behold! the word of Yahweh is for them as dung. They do not desire it. At this point, Jeremiah unconsciously senses the inspi ration that he is consciously resisting. He realizes: 6:11a I am filled with the wrath of Yahweh. I am weary of containing it. Only now that Jeremiah is resigned does the prophecy be come manifest. 6:11c Pour upon the children in the street, and upon the gatherings of youths together. In accepting responsibility for realism (4:17-18), in in sisting on prophesying without stricture by cultic conven tions (4:19), and here in accepting the importance of his emotional well-being, Jeremiah exhibits a growing maturity. The Problem of the Northerners (10:22-24) The prose preaching and verse prophesying of 7:1 10:25 show a reversion to cultic literary conventions. Most of it is given in the first person, and there is a formal unit (8:14-9:6) where Jeremiah replies in antiphony. A few verses show personal detail. 10:22 A voice is heard: "Behold! it comes!" a great noise out of the north country to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a lair of jackals. Jeremiah had earlier prophesied destruction from the north, and that the northerners spoke an unintelligible lan guage. Here, for the first time, the verbatim text asserts that the northerners will be the destroyers of Judah. In later prophecies, this interpretation is abandoned and the north erners are described as the avengers of Judah's destruction, in a fashion consistent with their identification as the Medes</page><page sequence="11">Prophecies of Jeremiah 11 rather than the Babylonians. Since the Babylonian language was intelligible in Judah and Medean was not, Jeremiah's interpretation of the northerners as Babylonians, commenc ing here in 10:22, was inconsistent with earlier prophecies. I do not favor the view that an editor altered only some of Jeremiah's prophecies. A prophet may be inconsistent, but surely an editor engaged in pious fraud is not. Further, it is quite clear that Jeremiah was uneasy with the text of 10:22 for reasons that he was unable to specify. He writes: 10:23 I know, O Yahweh, that a mortal's way is not his own, that it is not in a walking man to direct his steps. 10:24 Correct me, O Yahweh, but in just measure; not in Thy anger, lest Thou diminish me. Jeremiah's uneasiness suggests that he was vaguely aware that his conscious understanding of his prophecy was not complete or not correct. In view of his earlier proph ecies concerning northerners speaking an unintelligible lan guage, secondary revision may be interpreted in 10:22. Je remiah's resistance to his unconscious inspirations induced distortions. The distortion was in the direction of Jere miah's presumptions, but the fact of distortion was signalled to consciousness by a sense of inexplicable anxiety. The Revelation of Guilt (Chs. 13-17) With the prophetic experience of chs. 13-17, cultic liter ary conventions are decidedly in the background and an idiosyncratic prophet emerges in Israelite history, perhaps for the first time since Elijah. The materials are again dated to the reign of Jehoiakim. Verses 13:1-11 are of interest because they are not prophecy. They present a minor fiction, couched in poetic metaphors, forming a title to the prophecies. Jeremiah writes that Yahweh told him to take the waistcloth from his loins and to hide it in a cleft of rock by the Euphrates. Returning, he finds it ruined and interprets the waistcloth as signifying Israel and Judah. The imagery of</page><page sequence="12">12 Daniel Merkur 13:1-11 is fictitious. In keeping with what was once a com mon, ancient practice (34), it is a mnemonic figure that epito mizes the prophecy which follows. The ruined loin-cloth al ludes to Jeremiah's prohibition to marry (16: Iff) for reason of the impending destruction of Israel (13:13-14). Jeremiah was then in his early twenties. The prophetic experience commences with prophecies of destruction. 13:13 Then thou shalt say to them, "Thus says Yahweh: 'Behold! I will fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness. 13:14 And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together,' says Yahweh. 'I will not pity nor spare nor have compassion, in destroying them.' " Jeremiah next speaks in his own voice, lamenting another prophecy which he already knows but does not disclose for twelve lines of verse. Yahweh introduces a much broader theme which is la tent throughout the remainder of the prophetic experience. 14:14 And Yahweh said to me: It is a lie that the prophets prophesy in My name. I did not send them, and I did not command them, and I did not speak to them. A lying locution, and divination, and deification, and the products of their own hearts, they self-prophesy for themselves. In 15:1, Yahweh reproves Jeremiah's plea of hope for Judah: "Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, yet My heart would not turn toward this people." Jeremiah, implicitly of lesser stature, is rebuked "because of what Ma nasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusa lem" (15:4b). Among other condensations, I interpret an</page><page sequence="13">Prophecies of Jeremiah 13 anti-monarchic reproach which Jeremiah fails to under stand as such. Instead, he pleads for pity (15:5). Yahweh replies, "Thou hast cast Me off" (15:6a), in direct rebuke of Jeremiah, as well as in literary allusion to the rejection of Yahweh by Samuel in the overtly anti-monarchic I Sam 9:7. Again, Jeremiah was not aware of the theologically impor tant literary allusion. Instead, he complains: "I am weary with relenting" (15:6d). Having distanced himself from Yahweh's words, whose truth he does not doubt but cannot accept, Jeremiah de pressively turns against himself, rather than continue to op pose Yahweh. He, the prophet, claims responsibility for the people's failure to heed his preaching, as if the severity of the preachings rather than the people's sins were to be blamed. Identifying with the aggressor, he condemns him self for the events he has just foretold: exile, as well as destruction. 15:7 I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land. I have bereaved them, I have destroyed my people. They did not turn from their ways. Jeremiah's words are, I suggest, best treated as dis placement. The change in mood prepares the way for his resistance to be allayed, so that the profound shock of 15:9e may become manifest. Jeremiah continues: 15:8 I have made their widows more in number than the sand of the sea. I have brought against the mother of a young man a destroyer at noonday. I have made anguish and terror fall upon her suddenly. 15:9a She who bore seven has languished. Her life-force has swooned. Her sun went down while it was yet day. She has been shamed and disgraced.</page><page sequence="14">14 Daniel Merkur Yahweh finally interrupts. 15:9e And the rest of them I will give to the sword before their enemies, says Yahweh. Apparently, the reference to the queen mother (13:8) had supplied the imagery for an association of ideas. The queen mother was associated with widows (15:8a) and then with the image of the bereaved mother of a young man (15:8c), before it brought to mind one particular bereaved mother (15:9a) whose other sons were also to die (15:9e). We learn this woman's identity only in the next verse. 15:10 Woe is me, my mother, that you bore me, a man of strife, a man of contention to the whole land! I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me. Jeremiah foretold his own death in the circumlocution of 15:9e! 15:11 Yahweh says: If I do not free thee for good, if I do not intercede for thee with the enemy in the time of trouble, and in the time of distress. The revelation is equivocal. It may be a condition; but it may be the "if. . . not" form of oath formula of ancient Israel (33, p. 391). Hurt, depressed, bitter and angry, Jere miah prefers to understand it cautiously as a condition for his survival, rather than a sworn guarantee. He flings re proach at Yahweh. 15:12 Shall iron be broken by iron from the north, and bronze? Jeremiah assumes that the "iron," the death impending for him, will come from his persecutors in Jehoiakim's court (15:10), rather than in the general destruction of Judah. However, his fury subsides and his complaint with Yahweh</page><page sequence="15">Prophecies of Jeremiah 15 shows coherent indignation at Yahweh's injustice. His de pression ends as he channels his aggression externally. 15:18 Why is my pain unceasing, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Wilt Thou be to me like a deceitful wadi, like waters that fail? Once the aggression is externalized, his unconscious guilt becomes manifest. 15:19 Therefore, thus says Yahweh: If thou wilt return, I will turn to thee. Before Me shalt thou stand. Jeremiah's summons to return, i.e. to repent, is the cli mactic revelation of the prophetic experience. He had not previously seen himself as a sinner. He is immediately for bidden to marry and to have children (16:2). Yahweh next delivers a classic Jeremiad at some length. One matter is of particular interest. Once the inspirations end, Jeremiah takes exception to the detail that, in exile, "you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor" (16:13b). To his thought (16:19-20), this prophecy is illogi cal, as its fulfillment would work against Judah's return to faith in Yahweh. Yahweh consequently replies: "Therefore, behold! I will make them know. . . that My name is Yah weh" (16:21). Although he often quarrelled with Yahweh, Jeremiah faulted Yahweh's logic only this once. Jeremiah's return to the motif of idolatry leads, soon afterward, to a conscious crystallization of the idea of his sinfulness. Yahweh says: 17:5 Cursed is the man who trusts in a mortal, and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from Yahweh. There is condensation here: A rebuke of Jeremiah's use of the name Yahweh for himself (15:16), an insistence on the metaphoric significance of all anthropomorphisms used by Yahweh, and an implicit opposition to all anthropo</page><page sequence="16">16 Daniel Merkur morphism. Jeremiah senses the implicit meaning; shortly afterwards, he writes: 17:12 A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary. 17:13 Yahweh, hope of Israel, all who forsake Thee shall be put to shame. Those who turn away shall be written in the earth, for they have forsaken the fountain of living water. Both traditional exegetes and modern Old Testament critics routinely understand much of the material which I interpret as highly personal dialogue between Yahweh and Jeremiah, as impersonal cultic rhetoric between Yahweh and Israel. Due to this systematic anachronism, commenta tors find various passages obscure and often seek to revise the plain sense of the words. A case in point is 17:13c-d, where scholars interpolate "turn away [from Thee]" and puzzle over "written." Bright observes: "The sense is usually taken to be that names of apostates will be inscribed in the dust (and soon erased and forgotten). But some . . . take 'earth' to denote the underworld; i.e., they will be listed for death" (2, p. 118). The imputation of such supernaturalism to Jeremiah speaks more of modern superstition than of the ancient prophet. In view of 22:30, where the sense is un equivocal, the writing refers literally to Jeremiah's writing of his inspirations. "Written in the earth" means "proph esied for the grave." The antithesis of earth and living water can scarcely be read otherwise. Inspiration influenced the second verse. The sanctuary is already an anthropomorphism. There is also condensa tion of the unconscious anti-monarchic theme through the reference to the throne on top of the ark as the exemplar of the sanctuary. Here is a typical index of on-going resistance to non</page><page sequence="17">Prophecies of Jeremiah 17 manifest materials: Jeremiah is suddenly and inexplicably anxious over what he has written. 17:14 Heal me, O Yahweh, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; for Thou art my praise. 17:17 Be not a terror for me. Thou art my refuge in the day of evil. His anxiety is due to his renunciation. Jeremiah's em phatic refusal to reject anthropomorphism, as exemplified in temple observances, is suppressed; but he experiences anxiety once he has done so. His inspirations are now forced to undergo symbolization to evade censorship. Yah weh tells him to go to the Benjamin Gate and, in Yahweh's name, to forbid all to carry burdens on the Sabbath. He does so. The men there pay no attention, however, to his preaching (17:19-27). Interpretation of the Sabbath materials should proceed precisely by reversing their manifest sense. Jeremiah has suppressed Yahweh's objection to temple practice. Yahweh therefore provides him with a symbolic substitute for the non-manifested revelation that will serve as its object lesson. Sabbath observance is equally anthropomorphic (Ex. 20:11), arbitrary and artificial. In commanding Jeremiah to observe the Sabbath, Yahweh punishes Jeremiah with a second idolatry for reason of his own—incidentally illustrating the theological principle of 16:13 to which Jeremiah objected. Yahweh simultaneously creates the opportunity for Jere miah to be confronted with his contemporaries' disinterest in the Sabbath. Jeremiah's interest in Sabbath observance is a text-book evidence for Freud's theory of religious ritual (11). As Gay (17,18) has remarked, Freud's original formulation con trasted religious ritual as the consequence of suppression, or voluntary renunciation, with neurotic ritual as the conse quence of involuntary repression. Freud later ignored the distinction (12, etc.), but without adducing evidence in sup port of his changed position. Jeremiah's concern with Sab bath observance was in the nature of a parapraxis rather</page><page sequence="18">18 Daniel Merkur than a pathological symptom. It was not a true compulsion. His extreme concern with the Sabbath soon abated, never to be mentioned again. Prophesying Out of Conscience (Ch. 20) Jeremiah's persecutors had earlier pressed for his execu tion; but the priests, royal ministers and king had yielded to the clan leaders in granting Jeremiah freedom to prophesy against Judah. Judan law prescribed, however, that madmen who falsely claimed to be prophets were to be placed in stocks (29:26). The priest Pashur, frustrated in seeking the death of Jeremiah as a false prophet, now had him beaten and placed in stocks overnight as a madman and no prophet at all (20:1 3). After his release, Jeremiah foretold Pashur's punishment (20:4-6) and composed a psalm (20:7-18) of the common meditational type (16, pp. 201-23) which commences with a recital of woe and ends with the poet's mood uplifted. A beat ing and a night in the stocks may be assumed to have left Jere miah physically fatigued and emotionally drained. Certainly, the psalm shows Jeremiah at a low ebb. His self-observations include one point of interest. 20:8b For the word of Yahweh has become for me a reproach and derision all day long. 20:9 If I say, "I will not mention Him, or speak anymore in His name," there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot. Jeremiah was neither compelled to preach nor obsessed with his prophecies in any technical sense of the terms. He had the power to suppress what he believed; but because he be lieved it true, he felt anguish for failing to give warning. Jeremiah was a man caught between social pressures to con form to what he viewed as morally reprehensible, and be tween personal standards of adjustment to the dictates of conscience. With remarkable courage, he chose the latter course.</page><page sequence="19">Prophecies of Jeremiah 19 Against Kings and Prophets (Chs. 22-23) Jeremiah's historical predicament should not be under stood on the traditional assumption that he was hated for the ill tidings of his prophecies. Jeremiah was hated, as he expressly asserts, because he decried as false prophecy the varieties of ecstasy employed by his contemporary cultic prophets. Jeremiah could not be attacked on these grounds alone—the Mosaic precedent supported him. Hence his enemies sought to catch him in a prophecy that proved false (20:10). Jeremiah's opposition, in Yahweh's name, to vari ous cultic practices formed a contestable middle ground which left him open to inconclusive attacks. His preaching against human sacrifices offered in the vale of Hinnoam or Tophet (19:1-13) led to his night in the stocks (20:1-2), but was not sufficient grounds for his execution under the stat utes of Deut. 13:1-5. It is not unimportant then, that Jere miah's next recorded prophecies (chs. 22-23) involve a ser ies of highly specific, detailed futurities. Jeremiah could not have courted danger more directly. Pashur's action against Jeremiah had had the implicit support of king Jehoiakim, and it was against the royal family that Jeremiah now prophesied. Jeremiah was reluc tant to do so. His prophecy starts with good tidings, holding out the prospect of continued rule on condition of repen tance, and asserting that punishment would occur only for reason of sin (22:1-5). But Jeremiah abruptly asserts the coming destruction of Jerusalem (22:6-9). A few verses fol low, as Jeremiah delays prophesying further politically dan gerous matters (22:10-17); but Jeremiah's prophecy ofje hoiakim's end absolutely relishes the imagined event as though it were a personal revenge. 22:19 With the burial of an ass he shall be buried, dragged and cast forth beyond Jerusalem's gates. Secondary revision has presumably colored the language here, as it is more consistent with Jeremiah's passion than Yahweh's more neutral voice. Antiphony follows in which Jeremiah addresses Jehoia</page><page sequence="20">20 Daniel Merkur kim as having been heedless of his voice from youth on ward. The remark is an intriguing autobiographical disclo sure about Jeremiah's connection with the court. Jeremiah favored and was favored by the faction of the full brothers Jehoahaz and Zedekiah, as against the faction of their half brother Jehoiakim; but scholars have only recently realized that "Jeremiah son of Hilkiah" (1:1) means "follower," not "descendant." Hence, the traditional assumption that Jere miah enjoyed access to the court as a scion of the priestly dynasty has collapsed. No explanation of Jeremiah's social status has been offered in its place. If I am right, however, in interpreting that Jeremiah was initiated into prophetism at age thirteen (25:3a), he would have been five or six years Jehoiakim's junior (2 Kings 23:26). For Jehoiakim to have known Jeremiah when he was a youth (Jer. 22:21) and Jere miah already a prophet raises a major issue. Even if by "youth" we interpret a young man of 20, Jeremiah would have been only 14 or 15. During their teenage years, the differences in their ages would have been too great for them to have been peers or friends. For Jeremiah to have known Jehoiakim as 22:21 implies, they must have been relatives. Such an interpretation helps explain the fact that, once Babylon had destroyed Jerusalem and ended the monarchy, and a provisional governor, installed by Babylon, had been murdered, the leadership of the Judans fell to Jeremiah. The traditional assumption of charismatic leadership on the basis of his prophetism is contrary to all that we know of Israelite sociology. Jeremiah had to have had dynastic claim to the leadership. Since my interpretation depends on the emendation of a verse that alters Jeremiah's age in a fashion necessary to render his bachelorhood credible and thereafter connects a series of verses and historical notices that cannot otherwise be consistent, to regard Jeremiah as a close relation of the royal family has considerable merit as a hypothesis. The mother of Jehoahaz and Zedekiah was one Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah; and it would be conso nant with my interpretation if the prophet had been</page><page sequence="21">Prophecies of Jeremiah 21 named for his grandfather. On this hypothesis, Jeremiah was slightly younger than Jehoahaz, slightly older than Ze dekiah, and had been their playmates during their forma tive years. After prophesying the death of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah turned to consider his son Coniah (later Jehoiachin), the heir apparent. Jeremiah seems to have borne no animosity toward the boy, then perhaps 11 or 12 years of age. Indeed, despite the political issues contingent on the reversion of the succession to Jehoahaz's faction, Jeremiah pleads with Yahweh on the boy's behalf. I present a translation of the prophecy with my form-critical divisions of its cultic conven tions indicated in brackets. [Prophecy] 22:24 As I live, says Yahweh, were Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, a signet ring on My right hand, yet from there I would pluck thee 22:25 and give thee into the hand of those who seek thy life, on whose account thou art afraid: the Chaldeans. 22:26 I will cast thee, and thy mother who bore thee, into another land where you were not born, and there you will die. 22:27 And to the land to which they lift their life-forces to return, there they will not return. [Antiphony] 22:28 Is he a pot broken and despised, this man Coniah? A vessel in which there is no desire? Why are he and his seed cast out and sent to a land they do not know? 22:29 O land, land, land, hear the word of Yahweh!</page><page sequence="22">22 Daniel Merkur [Prophecy] 22:30 Yahweh speaks thus: Write this man childless. The man will not succeed in his days, nor will a man of his seed succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah. Jeremiah's prophetic experience, however, does not conform with the cultic literary conventions. In 22:27, the shift from second to third person indicates that Jeremiah is here drawing his own conclusion from 22:26, assimilating the inspiration by rephrasing its content in words of his own improvisation. In other words, the ideas are here shifted from the prophecy's medium of imagination to his ego. The assumption that Coniah and the queen would "lift their life-forces" or yearn for return to Judah is Jeremiah's speculation and not Yahweh's prophecy. Having assimilated the words of Yahweh, Jeremiah replies in 22:28 in protest not of Coniah but of Yahweh. In 22:29, Yahweh gently chides Jeremiah and com mands him to hear—which in Hebrew has connotations to obey—the word that comes to him. In 22:30a, Jeremiah writes a proem, announcing his renewed resolve to accept and to obey. This passage attests to secondary revision, resistance and condensation. Jeremiah's prophecies are wish-fulfil ments, but there is something more involved. For the mo ment, it suffices to observe that the manifestation of a sec ond personality lends credibility to the impression that a "wholly other" reveals the inspired words of prophecy. Sub jectively, Jeremiah had reason to know that a personality other than his own was manifesting prophecies to him. I suggest that, in the absence of superego theory, reality-test ing compelled him to postulate Yahweh. Jeremiah blames the destruction of Judah on the sins of its kings and foretells a return of Judah from Babylo nian captivity (23:1-4). There follows his first messianic prophecy.</page><page sequence="23">Prophecies of Jeremiah 23 23:5 Behold! days are coming—Yahweh says— when I shall establish for David a righteous stalk; and the king will rule and reason, and do judgement and justice in the land. 23:6 In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will dwell in security. And this is his name by which Yahweh will call him: Our righteousness [Zedekenu]. To fulfill this prophecy Mattaniah later took the throne name Zedekiah. The traditional reading of the verse instead renders: 23:6c And this is his name by which he shall be called: Yahweh is our righteousness. Jeremiah was a supporter of the Davidid monarchy, but a latent anti-monarchic theme recurs at intervals through out his prophecies. Verses 23:5a and 23:6a pertain to a mortal son of David, but the king of 23:5b is revealed in 23:6b as Yahweh and Yahweh alone. Tradition has followed the latent, not the manifest, content of the prophecy from early times. It was in order to depict the traditional reading as fulfilled that Matthew (7:21-22,28) had Jesus announce his messianic claims in an intense prophetic moment toward the end of the Sermon on the Mount, by accepting the name of Yahweh as his own, much to the astonishment of the crowds. Having exhausted the topic of the monarchy, Jeremiah observes: 23:9b My heart is shattered within me. All my bones shake. I have become like a drunken man, like a fellow whom wine has overcome, because of Yahweh, because of His holy words. In modern idiom, Jeremiah is "staggered" by the "dizzying heights" of understanding which he has attained.</page><page sequence="24">24 Daniel Merkur There are no extant prophecies from the period begin ning in the fifth year of Jehoiakim when the king gave orders for Jeremiah's execution and the prophet went into hiding (36:9-27) to the accession of Zedekiah some six years later. The Jest of the Yoke (Chs. 27-28) Jeremiah has changed considerably in the six years after he first hid from Jehoiakim. Above all else, he sees himself and others see him as a prophet fulfilled. Alone in Judah, he had foretold Jehoiakim's unlamented, violent death, Jehoiachin's failure to hold the throne, and the de portation of Jehoiachin and his family to Babylon. At the same time, he has grown cautious and cynical. He is thirty years of age and still a bachelor. He has, for well over a decade (6:10-11), known that the tragedy of Jerusalem and Judah will not be averted. Jeremiah's return to public life, which is in nature a grand theatrical entrance, involves a deliberate satire of the magical war rituals of Israel (1 Kings 22:11; 2 Chron. 18:10; 2 Kings 13:17) in which the brandishing of weapons was believed ritually to assure military victory (26, pp. 39 40). According to Jer. 27:2-3, Jeremiah was enjoying a pro phetic experience when he decided to fashion a wooden yoke for himself. He wears the yoke when he visits the envoys of Edom, Moab, Tyre, Sidon and Ammon who are in attendance at Zedekiah's coronation. Jeremiah tells them to accept the yoke of Babylon to avoid the punishment of Yahweh (27:9-10). Jeremiah has matured. He no longer preaches a repen tance that will not be enacted, but adopts a pragmatic ap proach. His words have the wisdom of political compro mise. He counsels to bear Yahweh's punishment of foreign hegemony and taxation with good grace. Jeremiah is a man no one will forget: a prophet of Yahweh who will be the talk of the marketplaces of six nations within a matter of weeks. Jeremiah should not be thought to have been sufficiently naive to have believed that anyone would heed his warning.</page><page sequence="25">Prophecies of Jeremiah 25 On the contrary: the satire of the yoke was deliberately calculated to shame, to goad men into anger, and to foment rebellion against Babylon. Jeremiah has become impatient. He wants the doom of Judah over and done with. Chapter 28 narrates a contest between Jeremiah and Hananiah son of Azzur, "the prophet from Gibeon." Hana niah views himself as the contender and Jeremiah as the champion. The motif of the yoke, which Hananiah borrows from Jeremiah (28:2-3, 10-11), proves how thoroughly Jer emiah dominated not only the public debate but even the wish-fulfillments of his rivals. Religious trance, it is to be remembered, is generally a religious use of self-hypnosis and depends on auto-suggestions for the initiation of its hallucinatory wish-fulfillments. Jeremiah's response to Hananiah's prophecies of deliv erance from Babylon are significant. 28:1 la Jeremiah the prophet went his way. 28:12 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 28:13 "Go, tell Hananiah, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh: Thou has broken wooden bars, but thou hast made in their place bars of iron.' " Jeremiah made no response to Hananiah until he had had a further prophetic experience (3, pp. 166-7). Jere miah's attitude is that of a scientist repeating an experiment whose results had been challenged. His belief in his prophecies was voluntary and, as such, neither obsessive nor delusional. The Restoration (Chs. 30-31) The prophetic experience of chs. 30-31 is remarkable on several scores. Jeremiah again foretells the return from the impending Babylonian captivity; but for the first time he links the futurity with the north country (31:8). He no longer misinterprets who the northerners are. Messianic al lusions occur (30:9), but with a curious twist.</page><page sequence="26">26 Daniel Merkur 30:21 Their prince shall be one of themselves. Their ruler shall come forth from their midst. I will make him draw near, and he shall approach Me; for who is there that would pledge his heart to approach Me? says Yahweh. A conscript and not a volunteer. How bitter Jeremiah is! Again, he fails to recognize the implicit anti-monarchism. He writes: 30:23 Behold the storm of Yahweh! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked. 30:24a The firece anger of Yahweh will not turn back. Unconscious pressures influence the next words, abruptly ameliorating their sentiment. 30:24b until He has accomplished and established the intentions of His heart. With Jeremiah's resistance broken, unimpeded proph ecy follows. 30:24d In the latter days you will understand this. 31:1 At that time, says Yahweh, I will be as God for all the families of Israel, and they shall be for Me as a people. More or less conventional cultic prophecy follows for a dozen verses before Jeremiah is at last willing to hear what Yahweh wishes to tell him. 31:15 Thus says Yahweh: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are not. Although Jeremiah has determined on a poetic refer ence to Rachel, his inspirations employ the symbolism as a</page><page sequence="27">Prophecies of Jeremiah 27 displacement of references to himself. The legendary burial tomb of Rachel was in the vicinity of Ramah, but Ramah was also the home of the prophet Samuel. Jeremiah has several times foreseen the return from captivity, but the destruction of Judah has so demoralized him that he has, until this moment, been without gladness and hope for the future. 31:17 There is hope for thy future, says Yahweh, and your children will come back to their borders. There is condensation here, as in 31:15. His children, not metaphorically all Judah, but genuinely his. Now, thirty-nine years of age, he is still to father children! The revelation is too much for him. He pushes the idea away, dares not trust it, insists on conforming with the literary conventions of cultic prophecy, takes the imagery as meta phor alone. Yahweh chides him: 31:18a I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning. With the shift in gender from Rachel to Ephraim, Jere miah cannot deny that Ephraim refers to himself. In reply to Yahweh, he bursts out with an allusion to the occasion of his prohibition to wed (16:2). He is stubborn and petulant. 31:18b Thou chastised me, and I was chastised as a calf that was not trained. Overdetermination informs the allusion to the golden calf, making the sin seem somehow forgivable. Jeremiah insists: 31:18d When Thou makest me to return, I return, for Thou art Yahweh my God. 31:19a For after I had returned, I repented. After I was informed, I smote on the thigh. The next lines are extremely complex as Jeremiah's con tinuing resistance induces circumlocutions. Yahweh asks: 31:20a Have I a dear son—in Ephraim?</page><page sequence="28">28 Daniel Merkur There is condensation here. "Have I a dear son" means "Would a son be dear to me (Jeremiah)?" The completed line asks whether Jeremiah is dear to Yahweh: 31:20b Is he a child of delights? There is again condensation. Is Jeremiah a happy man? Would not a child be a source of happiness? 31:20c For as often as I speak of [or, in] him, I do remember him still. Again, condensation. Yahweh remembers Jeremiah; but also Jeremiah remembers the desire for a son. Jeremiah now replies to Yahweh: 3I:20e If so, my loins yearn for him. At last a direct reference to sex, instead of circumlocution! The celibate is at last coming round. Yahweh continues: 31:21c Set thy heart to the highway, the road by which thou wentest. Return, O virgin Israel, Return to these thy cities. Jeremiah is "virgin Israel," a Rachel (31:15) who waited decades to beget children. The overcoming of Jeremiah's resistance to have sex and to procreate a family appears to have been the precon dition for one of the single longest passages by Yahweh in Jeremiah's prophet experiences (as distinct from speeches given in Yahweh's name as a cultic literary convention). This passage, toward the end of the prophecy, which forms the climax of the particular prophetic experience, is per haps the most optimistic prophecy in the Later Prophets. 31:30 Behold! days are coming, Yahweh says, and I shall compact to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah a new covenant; 31:31 Not as the covenant that I compacted with their fathers,</page><page sequence="29">Prophecies of Jeremiah 29 in the day that I held their hands to bring them out of the land of Egypt, that they overturned My covenant although I was master over them, says Yah weh; 31:32 but this is the covenant that I shall compact to the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I shall give My doctrine in their inward parts, and on their hearts I shall write it; and I shall be for them a God, and they will be for Me a people. 31:33 And they will not teach further, a man to his neighbor, and a man to his brother, saying, "Know Yahweh!" For all of them will know Me, from their smallest to their greatest, says Yahweh; for I shall forgive their wrongdoings, and their sins I shall not remember further. The fantasy of a marriage covenant underlies the conscious revelation of the new covenant of the nation. In 31:31, ba'al, "master," can also mean "husband." In 31:32, the interiorization of the Torah, "doctrine," considered eidetically as a scroll entering an abdomen, is a symbol of coital penetration. In 31:33, the emphasis on knowledge is an allusion to carnal knowledge. (The word play is Hebrew, whence the Biblical English.) In 31:35-36, the emphasis on "seed," rather than the more customary "children," completes the developed sequence with an allusion to orgasm. Still, the passage is overdetermined and there is no simple sublimation of a marriage covenant into a national one. The independence of Yahweh, as a definitely separate voice, is disclosed in the reproach of Jeremiah contained in the words "even I" in 31:36c. Yahweh has not despised Israel's sins. Jeremiah has. The overdetermination of the</page><page sequence="30">30 Daniel Merkur two words is extensive. Implicit in 31:18 is the fact that Jeremiah had, for years, ascribed to himself a sin "of his youth" as the reason that Yahweh demanded his celibacy. Just as he had refused to forgive himself a sin, long re pented and abandoned, so now "even I" insists that he, and not Yahweh, was refusing to forgive the sins of his nation. Again, just as the coital fantasy fulfills the wish for self forgiveness by the words "even I," the fantasy serves as a symbol for the renewal of his love for his nation. Lastly, the coincidence of the two lines of thought—private and pub lic—provides Jeremiah with the insight that his sexual frus tration is, and always was, the reason that his youthful hope for his nation had soured into resentment which he had projected onto Yahweh as Yahweh's hatred of Judah. In other words, Jeremiah recognized that sexual frustrations had prejudiced his interpretations of Yahweh's revelations, leading him into affective anthropomorphism and hence to idolatry. The climactic events of Jeremiah's adventures—his im prisonment, reprieve, and escape from Jerusalem during its fall—all followed the renewal of his faith. His prophecies had already been made. There remained only to survive their fulfillment. Perhaps he was incapable of prophesying while he was imprisoned. If he prophesied while in prison, the prophecies are not extant. Conclusion The Phenomenology of Jeremiah's Prophecies In the experience of Jeremiah, prophecy consisted pri marily of words. Biblical Hebrew understands, by the word roots dbr, 'mr, and n'm, "to speak, say utter, reveal; to think, cognize, have ideas," making no distinction between verbal speech and ideation. At no time did Jeremiah see Yahweh. Indeed, there is no evidence of any eidetic experiences. Jere miah invented one eidetic myth for mnemonic purposes— the spoiled loincloth—to conform with the cultic conventions</page><page sequence="31">Prophecies of Jeremiah 31 of his day. Anthropomorphic language is rare and, without exception, intended figuratively as metaphor. The voice of Yahweh, as Arbman (1, Vol. 1, pp. 253-4) and others have recognized, was not an audition but a figurative designation for verbal ideations. The prophetic words issued from Jeremiah's uncon scious and frequently without demonstrable distortions mani fested consciously. Jeremiah could and often did impose distortions on his prophecies, to conform to the literary con ventions of cultic prophecy. He was not at all times happy with the compromise. His most important prophecies, both per sonal and political, transpired when he was willing to receive revelations without literary preconditions. Resistance against receiving prophecies could also occur for other reasons. Jere miah's emotional state could prevent the clarity of a revela tion. The distortions took a variety of forms. The well known phenomena of the "dream work" (10), condensation, dis placement, and secondary revision were most frequent. On at least two occasions, Jeremiah experienced real sense perceptions—the potter's house, and the baskets of figs (ch. 24)—as symbols which inspired prophetic associa tions as their meanings became manifest. His prophecies exhibit an internal pattern of association. The flitting char acter of his associations was not so extensive as to be "free association," but neither was it as controlled as during nor mal consciousness. During the prophetic experience, Jere miah was at all times conscious, wakeful and lucid. His abil ity to experience somatizations establishes beyond question that he was not in trance. He was not in a condition of anaesthetic dissociation. Although Jeremiah's belief in Yahweh was complete, he was aware that his psyche could induce distortions in his inspirations. Consequently, he was at pains to correct him self. On one youthful occasion, he attempted to correct Yahweh over a presumed illogic. The verse, "Call unto Me, and I shall answer you" (33:3), suggests that, during his prophetic state, Jeremiah had additionally to adopt an in quiring attitude in order to open himself to associations by way of inviting a response.</page><page sequence="32">32 Daniel Merkur The Metapsychology of Jeremiah's Prophecies Contrary to the opinion of Biblical scholars, there were no hallucinations among Jeremiah's experiences. Neither is there evidence of obsessive or delusional thought. Indeed, much of his dialogue with Yahweh was an effort to reality test the inspirations. In short, there is reason to sustain Jeremiah's claim that prophecy in his own experience was a fundamentally different phenomenon from the religious trances of his contemporaries. The phenomenology of Jeremiah's prophecies is better understood through comparison with another class of mod ern religious experiences. Most spontaneous phenomena, together with psychedelic experiences, differ from religious trances (28) in precisely the same manners as the proph ecies of Jeremiah. These states, which I collectively term "religious reveries," are like religious trances being states of involuntary belief in the reality of the sacred (divine, de monic, etc.). In other respects, the two classes of ecstasy differ significantly. Religious reveries involve not hallucina tions but pseudo-hallucinations that are known, even dur ing their experience, to be intrapsychic and imaginary. Reli gious reveries are analogous in this respect to the "lucid dream," in which the dreamer knows that he is dreaming, and is nonetheless cognitively and emotionally caught up in his dreams. Like dreams (10, p. 535), religious reveries may consist of concrete imagery, appropriate to any of the senses, but may instead consist of verbal ideation alone— precisely as was the majority experience of Jeremiah. Dur ing religious reveries, the subject regards what he knows to be intrapsychic and imaginary as apperceptions of objec tively valid truths through the medium of imagination. Al though this belief is involuntary, it is not produced in the same fashions (i.e. obsessions and delusions) as are involun tary beliefs in religious trances. Involuntary belief is produced by the attendant affec tive state, rather than by a repression of reality-testing. In religious reveries, the affective state is, at intermittent mo ments, so overwhelmingly intense that it commands the fo cus of attention. Despite its hypercathexis, reality-testing is</page><page sequence="33">Prophecies of Jeremiah 33 relegated to the periphery of consciousness. In other mo ments, the discharge of affect is temporarily expended and reality-testing regains its executive function. S. Cohen suggests that prophecy is, at bottom, a process of "creative conscience formation" that actively extends and refines conscience beyond the extent with which most people are normally satisfied. The motive for the endeav our is self-fulfillment as an individual through the pursuit of ideals, and may or may not be prompted by external crisis of personal or cultural orders (6). In my own view, "conscience" is an acceptable designation as long as it is understood as a general faculty of self-approval and self criticism, with morality being only one among the super ego's several criteria for value judgement. The God-Concept in Jeremiah's Prophecies Jeremiah's theology and, in specific, his concept of God must be differentiated from his state of religious reverie. Jeremiah began as a devotee of the Jerusalem cult of his day, but his theology developed along lines that may best be described as successive manifestations of an unconscious theology that was reasonably complete from the start. His rejection of anthropomorphism proceeded from an indul gence in the images, through an early denial of the reality of man-made gods (16:19-20), to the final, climactic verses of his covenant prophecy (31:34-36) in which he character izes Yah weh as the ruler of the natural cosmos. A latent anti-monarchism recurs in his prophecies which never be came conscious. These indices that his superego had a spon taneous theological thrust require theoretic explanation. Perhaps the most important fact about Jeremiah's the ology is that the verses of the covenant prophecy are the earliest provable instances in the Old Testament of an ex clusive monotheism. The older volumes of the Bible fre quently refer to "gods" and "sons of gods" in addition to Yahweh. Further, the older texts oppose, but do not deny the reality of, foreign gods such as Baal and Ashtoreth. In First Temple Israel, Yahweh was the supreme god, but he</page><page sequence="34">34 Daniel Merkur was not the only god. With these verses of Jeremiah, the idea of one god, controlling the whole of the cosmos, makes its appearance in the Bible for the first time. Rizzuto (31) has noted that Freud addressed himself to the abstract concept of God only in Moses and Monotheism (15). In all of his earlier writings on the topic, Freud dis cussed only concrete images of God, gods, ghosts, devils, and totems, which he considered to be symbolic representa tions of the father. As has previously not been recognized, Moses and Monotheism presents serious difficulties. In it, Freud argues that the abstract concept of God is derived from concrete images, whose latent meaning is the father. The problem with the argument is its necessary but un stated corollary. If both God images and the God-concept have the father as their latent meaning, religion has no psychogenesis. Only arbitrary cultural conventions deter mine which father symbols are secular and which are reli gious. However, if the principle of psychic determinism is correct, there is no such thing as an arbitrary social conven tion. In effect, Freud presupposed religiosity and analyzed its symbolism. He did not offer a causal theory explaining the raison d'etre of religion, as he claimed to do. Because Biblical scholars are agreed that the legend of Moses is not a reliable data base for discussion of the origin of monotheism, it seems best to accept Freud's description of Moses and Monotheism as a "novel" and to defend the principle of psychic determinism with data whose scientific validity is assured. The latent content of Jeremiah's revelation of Yahweh's exclusivity concerned Jeremiah's exclusive possession of a wife of his own. The unity of an ideal self-representation underlies the God-concept and imparts unconscious unity to it. Jeremiah's ideal self-representation, i.e. ego-ideal or superego, was presumably derived from memories of his father (among other sources). However, in its projection of the God-concept, his ego-ideal pertained to himself as a father. The development of an ideal of self as a parent occurs at puberty in the healthy child. Since intellectualization is also typical of the adolescent, I venture to suggest that the</page><page sequence="35">Prophecies of Jeremiah 35 concept of self as a procreator is the unconscious basis for the abstraction of a concept of a Creator. By projecting the God-concept, e.g., during a religious conversion experi ence, the adolescent retains dependency on a sublimated father-imago during the process of gaining freedom from the authority of the real father. As an internal source of support for the adolescent, mediating between dependence on the father and adult self-reliance, the God-concept clearly has an adaptive function. Whether it should be out grown once adulthood is reached is a separate issue that must, I suggest, be left for philosophers to debate. For the present, it suffices to observe that the God concept is psy chogenetic and not an arbitrary cultural convention. Only because it is psychogenetic can the pre-existence of Jere miah's unconscious theology be explained in terms of psy chic determinism. Jeremiah's theological development toward exclusive monotheism, his increasing opposition to anthropomor phism in all of its forms, and his latent opposition to king ship were manifestations of his ego-ideal, which determined the unity of its projection as the God-concept. The abstrac tion of his ego-ideal projected increasingly abstract God concepts, leading Jeremiah to oppose anthropomorphisms. Finally, Jeremiah's latent opposition to kingship indicates a drive to assert the exclusivity of his ego-ideal, in opposition to a cultural father-figure. The Psychology of Jeremiah. For a man of his time and culture, Jeremiah was an extraordinarily wholesome individual. However, Jeremiah could not have kept to his choice of virginity without the aid of a harsh superego, as is indicated in his complaint: "I did not sit in the company of merrymakers, nor did I rejoice. Because of Thy hand I sat alone, for Thou hadst filled me with indignation" (Jer. 15:17). Another index that his su perego was harsh is that his entire career of preaching was an almost uninterrupted complaint, indicating a depressive tendency in his personality. Still, Jeremiah's prophecies</page><page sequence="36">36 Daniel Merkur were not a flight from reality but a confrontation with in trapsychic realities. His courage to win insight into the make-up of his psyche—albeit not psychoanalytic insight— endowed him with the courage to defy temple and king. In an age of confident Judan jingoism, he insisted that the traditional values of Israelite prophetism and religion be treated as a code for personal, social and political conduct.
