<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Democratic Civilization. By Leslie Lipson. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964. Pp. xiii, 614. $10.00.) Mr. Lipson, who is Professor of Political Science at the University of California at Berkeley, presents us with a poignant example of the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of writing a good text-book which is also a good book. Good text-books are directed at some cautiously predetermined level of reader comprehension. Good books are directed at the subject matter. Good text-books must "cover the ground" and be "fair." Good books must be penetrating. Good text-books impress by their ability to simplify the known. Good books impress by their intimations of insight into the unknown. Mr. Lipson is too good a writer to be content with a series of capsule condensations suitable for application to multiple choice examinations. On the other hand, he is not sure enough about what he really wants to say on the subject of The Democratic Civilization to make this book into the magnum opus one suspects he hoped for. The scope is vast and sweeping. The first part of the book reviews classical and modern conceptions of democracy â€” surely a topic of sufficient subtlety to call forth extended inquiry. But the author ends the review uncertainly and rushes on: There is a liberal democracy, as there is a social democracy. Democracy, ioherendy, is not necessarily either collectivistic or individualistic. It may at times be of the one type, at times of the other, and is normally a blend of both. To understand the criteria, therefore, let us look at cases. To learn about Democracy, let us compare democracies, (p. 73) We are, hence, led onward to examine the facts of various cases. Interesting, well-presented facts they are: the expansion of the suffrage in Britain, slavery in the United States, apartheid in South Africa, and the assimilation of linguistic groups in various countries. Then come chapters on geopolitics (democratic states tend to be sea powers), economic relationships in modern Europe and America (with dashes of Jefferson, Hamilton, and Marx), and the welfare state (democracy and the social services grew up together). The third part of the book surveys the legal and political processes of democratic nations: voting, party-systems, constitutions, legislatures, execu tives, cabinets. Most of the illustrations are drawn from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, although Scandinavia, Switzerland, Brazil, and the Commonwealth powers receive some attention. This is the best part of the book. It is defiantly old-fashioned (i.e., non-quantitative, non-behavioral, non-functional) comparative politics, blessed with a richness of historical detail and freed from the constrictive framework of Mr. Lipson's earlier Great Issues of Politics. The fourth part of the book carries us back to some of the theoretical issues of the book's opening, with regrettably little of the opening concern for definitional criteria. The concepts of liberty, equality, majority-rule, minority rights, and the public good are reviewed by Mr. Lipson. Noting the many logical contradictions that divide elements in what has been called the democratic tradition, the author nevertheless sees a need for synthesis 128</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews and sets forth, rather tentatively, to examine the possibility of such a synthesis. Beginning with liberty and equality he says "it is possible that they may ultimately appear as different, yet related, aspects of one and the same concept." (p. 521) In one of his more extended excursions into the theoretical, Mr. Lipson seeks to capture this difference and this relatedness, and does so with considerable literary skill, despite the annoying ambiguity of his conclusion: "Phrased as a philosophical equation, democracy equals liberty multiplied by equality." (p. 543) To wrench this quotation out of context is no doubt a bit unfair; but it does illustrate the curious usages to which the author subjects the word "philosophical." The word is identified with ideas, ideologies, programs, justifications, and, occasionally, philosophy. Mr. Lipson seems unable to decide whether he is a historian or a political theorist. Like the historically oriented Oxonians who trained him, he sometimes appears skeptical of theory: "That is a fine sounding phrase, but it is a formal category devoid of substance." (p. 522, said of J. S. Mill.) Yet the avowed aim of the book is theoretical, "to examine the democratic form of government and appraise it, and ... to suggest a general theory of the political process." (p. 6) Though many institutions and ideas labeled democratic are examined in the book, Mr. Lipson does not get within a furlong of isolating "the democratic form." True, he writes as if democracy were singular; indeed, he almost personifies the beast. Democracy (whatever it is) "seeks," "strives," "has its own views," "demonstrates," "mobilizes," "designs institutions," "attaches importance to questions," "is dedicated," (pp. 274, 276, 396, 476, 477, 576, 517, 594) and so on in an endless series of anthropomorphic operations. But when it comes to pinning down the essence of the "it" that performs all these operations, Mr. Lipson nods to the ambiguities and contradictions in extant usages and slides off the hook with such mushy phrases as " . . . with greater amplitude of scope, the concept [of democracy] becomes far richer, though also less clear." (p. 73) Or, he speaks in a vein of pseudo-realism and suggests the need to accept the inevitable "interplay of social forces with philosophic influences" (p. 773) without coming to grips with the problem of causality such "interplay" implies.
