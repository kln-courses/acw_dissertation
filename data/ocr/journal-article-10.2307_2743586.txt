Bernard Knapp Explanations for the rise of social complexity increasingly turn to politico-economic, social, or behavioural models that emphasize multivariate causality. Because the incipient stages in the devel- opment of social complexity on Cyprus have never been examined in an explicit, problem-oriented context, the material focus of this study is on the presentation and analysis of archaeological data from the Prehistoric Bronze Age ("Early-Middle Cypriot" pe- riods). A broad range of evidence is discussed, and, in order to evaluate the interrelationship amongst environment, production, exchange, and location in the development of power and prestige, the social implications of metallurgical and agricultural produc- tion are considered within a politico-economic framework. A. BERNARD KNAPP is Archaeological Research Assistant, British Academy Research Group Project "Science and Archaeology: Bronze Age Trade in the Aegean and Adjacent Areas," Depart- ment of Archaeology and Museum of Classical Archaeology, Uni- versity of Cambridge (Sidgwick Ave., Cambridge CB3 9DA, En- gland). Born in I94i, he was educated at the University of Akron (B.A., i967) and the University of Califomia, Berkeley (M.A., I973; Ph.D., I979). He has been Lecturer in Archaeology and An- cient Near Eastem Studies at the University of Califomia, Berke- ley (I979-83), National Research Fellow in the Department of Ar- chaeology at the University of Sydney (1i984-87), and Fulbright Fellow at the Cyprus-American Archaeological Research Insti- tute, Nicosia (1i988). His research interests include complex soci- eties, island archaeology, economic anthropology, and archaeology and ethnohistory. He has published (with T. E. Stech) the collec- tion Prehistoric Production and Exchange: The Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean (UCLA Institute of Archaeology Mono- graph 25), Copper Production and Divine Protection (Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology Pocketbook 42), Ancient Western Asia and Egypt: History and Culture (Chicago: Dorsey Press, i988), and Society and Polity at Bronze Age Pella (Redditch: Caradoc Books, iggo). The present paper was submitted in final form io viii 89. One of Cypriot archaeology's most provocative prac- titioners wrote some years ago that a principal difficulty "in attempting a logical and meaningful synthesis of de- velopments in the island's Bronze Age . . . is that the basic data consist almost entirely of questions and virtu- ally no answers" (Merrillees 1973:44). Notwithstanding this intriguing proposition, the archaeological study of Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus consists of endless an- swers but few germane questions. In this study, qualita- tive analysis of a broad range of archaeological data from that period (about 2500/2400-i800/1700 B.C.) facilitates investigation of the interrelationship amongst spatial, economic, and environmental factors in the emergence of sociopolitical power and prestige. Elsewhere I have discussed in detail how, during the first stage of the sub- sequent Protohistoric Bronze Age (about I800/1700- 1500/1400 B.C.), increased external demand for Cypriot copper within the Aegean and the eastern Mediterra- nean and the associated need to organise formally the (intemal and extemal) administration of the copper trade worked hand in hand with Cyprus's strategic (market) location to heighten social complexity and concentrate political power on the island (Knapp I986a, b, i988a, b). Although the process as revealed in the material record appears to have been gradual (if not altogether peaceful), the trajectory of socio-political change from the Prehis- toric to the Protohistoric Bronze Age is more dramatic and discontinuous than at any other time in Cypriot prehistory. Developments and innovations in an ar- chaeological database as immense as it is diverse rep- resent the transformation of an isolated, village-based culture into an international, urban-oriented, complex society. In this study, the incipient stages in the develop- ment of social complexity are examined in an explicit, problem-oriented context. The subsistence base and settlement patterns of the Prehistoric Bronze Age are considered anew in the general framework of the sec- ondary-products revolution (Sherratt I98I, I983). The emergence of copper-bronze metallurgy and its impact upon Cypriot politico-economic organisation and change are considered within a theoretical framework rooted in formalist economics, social history, and polit- ical anthropology (Brumfiel and Earle's [i987:3-41 "political" model). Although maritime contacts re- mained limited, external demand, the surge in metals production, and innovative subsistence practices com- bined to transform the earliest Bronze Age society on Cyprus. i. I am grateful to John F. Cherry, David Frankel, Steve Held, J. Basil Hennessy, Priscilla Schuster Keswani, Clay Mathers, David Rupp, James Muhly, Edgar Peltenburg, and Stuart Swiny for dis- ceming comments on earlier drafts of this paper (although some surely would not like to be held responsible). I am also pleased to acknowledge inspiration from previous studies on prehistoric Cy- prus by Steve Held, David Frankel, Nicholas Stanley Price, and Stuart Swiny. I also thank Priscilla Schuster Keswani, who pro- vided me with a copy of her important, recently completed disser- tation. Basic research involved in this study was undertaken while I held a Fulbright Fellowship at the Cyprus-American Archaeolog- ical Research Institute (CAARI). On that account, I thank Daniel Hadjittofi, Director of the Fulbright Commission in Nicosia, and Stuart Swiny, Director of CAARI, for their help, interest, and full support during my tenure (January-July i988). Figure i was ably drawn by John Donaldson (Faculty of Classics, Cambridge Univer- sity). Although the application of the secondary-products revolu- tion to the Prehistoric Bronze Age cultural sequence on Cyprus and the use of a politico-economic model to consider innovations in copper metallurgy are devices of my own making, much of Andrew Sherratt's research and studies by Stephen Shennan and Julian Thomas provided valuable insight and sharpened lacklustre percep- tions.

The Sequence of Cultures Recent research in Cypriot prehistory has called into question the temporal periodisation of the traditional "Three-Age" sequence (Frankel I988, Held I989a, Knapp n.d., Stanley Price 1979a, Swiny i989). An early, informal use of this (Neolithic-Chalcolithic-Bronze Age) sequence was conflated with a phase-scheme based primarily on pottery seriation. Subsequently each (pre- Bronze Age) phase, named after a type-site, assumed chronological significance and ultimately attained the status of a fixed time period. The composite result (Di- kaios i962:192-203) took little account of technological development or social change and raised clear obstacles to the explanation of cultural continuity or discon- tinuity (Stanley Price 1979a:1-4). With Bronze age data, overclassified ceramic se- quences were used to construct somewhat inflexible chronological schemes, and pottery seriation became a temporal-transgressive indicator that dominated discus- sions of cultural development. The strong chronological overtones of terms used for phases often led to prejudge- ment in the relative placement of spatially defined ceramic assemblages. Although some of the most in- fluential archaeologists working on Cyprus during the I950S and I96os clearly recognized the difficulties of forcing ceramic material islandwide into an Early- Middle-Late Bronze Age developmental sequence (Stew- art i962:2I0; Merrillees I965:140; Catling 1973:I65- 66), it was not until detailed examination of Red Polished pottery from the Episkopi Phaneromeni2 exca- vations revealed the existence of contemporaneous, re- gional ceramic traditions (Herscher 1976, I980; Swiny 1979) that the limitations of a unilinear approach- fostered by inadequate cultural-temporal subdivisions- could be demonstrated (on the concept of a ceramic trad- ition, see Neff, Bishop, and Arnold I988:343). Although radiocarbon dating has also eroded the foun- dations of traditional time sequences (Stanley Price 1979b:22-23), Cypriot archaeologists still balk at the concept of overlapping periods (i.e., "cultures") and ac- cordingly consider cultural variation and change more in temporal than in spatial terms: "At the moment we do not know how [the Philia Culture] came about or how it interacted with indigenous aspects of the Erimi Culture, but methodological confusion will persist if we continue to have what amounts to contemporaneity between the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze periods, even if they prove to be regionally based" (Peltenburg n.d., emphasis added). As Childe (i956:95-96, cited by Renfrew 1979:57), pointed out, however, "The boundaries of cul- tures are in fact spatial, as well as temporal, and the denotation of their conventional names must be equally limited." Understanding the sequence of Cypriot prehis- toric cultures (table i) therefore involves not only the issue of contemporaneity in material-culture variability but, equally if not more important, the issue of regional variability. From the "synchronic diversity" of the (Neo- lithic) Sotira culture (Peltenburg 1978) through the inter- and intrasite variability of the (Chalcolithic) Erimi cul- ture (Bolger i988:127-32; I987; Peltenburg i987) to the ceramic differentiation of the Bronze Age (Frankel 2. In the attempt to maintain a consistent, standardized site refer- ence system, Cypriot archaeological nomenclature (usually) con- sists of two elements (e.g., Episkopi Phaneromeni): the second top- onym (in the specialist literature always italicized) refers to the actual site location (Phaneromeni-as known locally and by tradi- tion), the first to the modem town or village (Episkopi) in whose territory-as defined by the cadastral plans-the archaeological site is included. Once cited in their full form, or for the sake of convenience and brevity, sites are occasionally referred to by the better-known of the two elements (e.g., Maroni rather than Maroni Vournes).</page><page sequence="3">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus 1 149 1974a, b; Herscher I98I; Merrillees 197I), regionalism is a well-documented feature of the Cypriot archaeolog- ical record (Knapp 1979:19-28). Posited relationships amongst different Prehistoric Bronze Age material- culture groups must continue to be monitored to ensure that they are synchronic and not simply "homotaxial" (Frankel 1974a:3). This study examines broader mate- rial-culture structures than those usually presented and considers continuity or discontinuity in different prod- ucts through space and time. Absolute dating helps to refine the spatial aspect and allows material-culture change to be investigated apart from purely time-bound definitions (Stanley Price 1979a: 8-9). The limiting factor in discussions of the Prehistoric Bronze Age has always been the use of a single crite- rion-pottery, mostly from mortuary contexts-to de- velop the relative chronology upon which all other investigation must be based. Notwithstanding the in- valuable contextual information thereby gained and de- spite the sophisticated studies of style and its possible relationship to social structure that have resulted (Fran- kel 1974a, 1978, I988), the development and refinement of ceramic taxonomy still tends to dominate research in both Early and Late Prehistoric periods. Rigid classifica- tion schemes (Coleman I985:136-40) typified by re- gional (northwest or north coast) or functional (mor- tuary) biases tend to mask variability that could help to sort out socio-cultural discontinuity or development, particularly at the interregional level. Settlement sites of the Prehistoric Bronze Age reveal an array of economic, demographic, architectural, and metallurgical data (table 2) that permit a more comprehensive and realistic ap- praisal of cultural continuity and change than that given by pottery alone (Carpenter I98I, i982; Barlow I985; Coleman I985; Scharr I985; Swiny I986a). Despite cer- tain sequential or developmental tendencies that may be seen in the material (e.g., ceramics [Barlow i982, Herscher I98I], metal types [Swiny I986a:66-97; i982]), few fixed stratigraphic or temporal criteria exist. Limited finds of goods exchanged between Cyprus and its Levantine or Aegean neighbours during the Prehis- toric Bronze Age often have problematic contexts and provide poor relative or absolute chronological resolu- tion. Because most of the material-imported or ex- ported-persisted long enough or was widely enough distributed to limit its use in defining or refining cul- tural synchronisms, it is still difficult to assess the chronological significance, much less the nature, of for- eign contacts during the period (table 3). Given the coarseness of the Cypriot temporal frame- work and the difficulty of establishing a relative chronology amongst Cyprus's typically single-period sites (Peltenburg I985a:38), cross-dating with known sequences in the Levant, the Aegean, or Anatolia has great potential value. However, since arguments based on cross-dating techniques often become circular or el- liptical (Merrillees 1977:35; Millet I987:IOI), high- precision recalibrated radiocarbon dates provide needed controls on any proposed relative chronology (see tables I, 4). In light of I 8 such dates that extend from the late Erimi culture through the Prehistoric Bronze Age, and considering radiocarbon and calibration dispersion dia- grams (Held I989a), the entire period seems to have lasted no longer than 8oo/6oo years, from about 2500/ 2400 to I800/1700 B.C. (table 4). This series of dates provides a tentative chronometric framework and allows material-culture variability to be considered in space, within and between reliable tempo- ral units. Considered in relation to a wide range of mate- rial data (table 2), the radiocarbon evidence makes it clear that the accepted temporal divisions of the Bronze Age stand in need of considerable revision (also Barlow I985; Coleman I985:136-38; n.d.). The terminology and periodisation used in this study represent a deliberate break with the elaborate techno-typological divisions of the tripartite system used in Cypriot archaeology. Bronze Age dates also reflect the influence of Manning's (i988) integrated reanalysis of all archaeological, scientific, and radiocarbon evidence relevant to the Bronze Age volcanic eruption on the Cycladic island of Thera. Manning's updating has a ripple effect on all east- ern Mediterranean cultures; on Cyprus, the final stage of the "Middle Cypriot" period must be pushed back to about I800 B.C., a date in close accord not only with the eight available recalibrated dates for "Middle Cypriot" phases of the Prehistoric Bronze Age (table 2; Knapp n.d., Manning I989) but also with the higher "traditional" chronological schemes for the Cypriot Bronze Age (e.g., Baurain I984, Merrillees 1977). The Material Record Cyprus's size and accessibility may have reduced some of the common risks inherent in island colonisation (Cherry I98I, I985; Held I989b). Although demands on local environments in an island setting (e.g., nutritional needs, overproduction of a restricted comestibles base) may tax even a robust ecosystem (Gorman 1979; Keegan and Diamond i987:62-65; Williamson I98I), the inhab- itants of Early Prehistoric Cyprus developed an agricul- tural subsistence base resilient enough to foster some organisational change in society (Knapp n.d.; Knapp I986a:46-49). If the occupational hiccup between the Khirokitia and Sotira cultures has been discounted cor- rectly (see table I), the subsequent spread of settlement throughout the Sotira and Erimi cultures can be seen as indicative of adaptation to ecosystemic constraints (Held I989a: chap. 3). Limited evidence for interregional contacts before the onset of the Prehistoric Bronze Age (Peltenburg 1978; I985a; I987:56) indicates that the is- landers fulfilled their own subsistence and social needs. Any informational or transactional opportunities offered by Cyprus's eastern Mediterranean or western Asiatic neighbours (Renfrew and Cherry I986) had limited im- pact. The degree to which prevailing social attitudes or en- vironmental factors may have limited structural change in the Prehistoric Bronze Age is an important question, but before an attempt is made to address it it is necessary</page><page sequence="4">1501 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 3I, Number 2, April I990 TABLE 2 Prehistoric and Protohistoric Bronze Age: Sites and Material Culture Architecture Ceramics Metals 0 4~~~~~~~~~~~P 0 P P I P cI , co 4 0 PL Site w c w X Erimi Pamboula I5 S 0 - 0 -- 0 - *0 0 0 - - - - 0 - - - - - - 0 - - - - - - Kissonerga Mosphilia I 2S o o o o oc 0 0d 0 0 0 0 0 - - - - - - - - - - - 0 --- Sotira Kaminoudhia I S 0 0 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 0 - - - - 0 - - - - - - ? 0 - 0 - 0 - Sotira Kaminoudhiat - - - - - - - - - - - - o - - - - o - - - - - - - ? oo o - - o PhiliaDrakos B ? t - - - - - - - 0 - 0 0 0 - - - - - - - 0 - - - - - - - - - AmbelikouAyios Georghios ? t 0 ? - - - - - 0 - 0 0 0 - - - - - - - 0 - - Kyra Alonia ? t - - - - - - - - O ? 0 0 PhiliaLaksia tou Kasinout - - - - - - - - - o0000 - 0 - - - - - - - o - 0 0 o - - - Nicosia Ayia Paraskevit - - - - - - - - - ? 0 - 0 - 0 0 - - - 0000 0 0 - - - Vasilia Evrimant - - - - - - - - - - - - 0 - - - - - - - - - - 0 0 0 0 - ?- Anoyira Trapezit - - - - - - - - - - - o 0 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Khrysiliou Ammost - - - - - - - - - o - - * - ? - - - - - - o Evdhimou Amolot - - - - - - - - - - *---oo - - Bellapais Vounous At - - - - - - - - - - 0 - - - - - 0 - 0 - -0 Bellapais Vounous Bt - - - - - - - - - - - - 0 - - - - - - - - 0 - 0 0 0 0 * - - - Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba 8i6-838t - - - - - - - - - - - - 0 - * - - - - - - - - - 0 - 0 - 0- Evdhimou Ambelovounos 4 - - - - 0 - - - - - ? 0 - 0 - - 0 - Ambelikou Aletri I5??- - - - - - - - - - - - * - - o - - - - - - - - - o *0- Alambra Mouttes I5 s - 0 0 0 0 0 0 - - - * - - -- - 0 - - - 0 0 0 0 0- Episkopi Phaneromeni Ct 0 - 0 0 - - - - - - - - ? 0 - - - - - Dhali Kafkallia I2 ? - - - - - - - - - - - ?

Prehistoric Bronze Age culture was deeply rooted in its agriculturally based predecessor (Hennessy I973:8). Stratigraphic excavations in Philia-culture or "Early/ Middle Cypriot" settlements may yet validate Stewart's (i962) arguments on the contemporaneity of these phases, particularly since excavations at the Philia- culture site of Sotira Kaminoudhia have produced ceramic and metal types that span much of the Prehis- toric Bronze Age and thus parallel the situation in the enigmatic Vasilia (Evriman and Kafkalla) tombs (Stew- art I957; Swiny I985b:23-24; n.d.; Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg i988). In this context, it must be added that the apparent long-term use or reuse of tombs during the Prehistoric Bronze Age may reflect not only pre- sumed taphonomic factors but also "ritual" treatment of the deceased (Keswani i989a). New information derived from stratified settlement excavations, survey work, and calibrated radiocarbon dating still lacks a comprehensive processual or even culture-historical synthesis (see, however, Swiny I989, n.d.). Although scholarly opinion still views Philia- culture material developments in unilinear, sequential terms (Bolger I983; Swiny i985a:II6; Peltenburg I987:58-59, 62), and despite the fact that some Philia- culture material may be regarded as transitional (be- tween that of the Erimi culture and that of the later Prehistoric Bronze Age), it must be regarded first and foremost as a regional variant of early Prehistoric Bronze Age culture (Stewart I962, Knapp n.d). Manifested first in various cemeteries in the north- western Mesaoria Plain (the type site being Philia Laksia tou Kasinou), the key material facets of the Philia cul- ture are subrectangular architecture, simple chamber tombs, distinctive Red Polished pottery, and a variety of mould-cast copper tools, weapons, and ornaments (Swiny I985a:II5-I6; Held i986). The inadequacy of typological data that might serve to establish an inter- nal, relative chronology is compounded by the lack of dependable radiocarbon-dated occupation deposits (an absolute chronology). Any attempt to compare Philia- culture material from tomb groups with that from trial trenches or pits in settlement sites (Philia Drakos B, Kyra Alonia) or from either of the former with that from proper stratigraphic excavations at settlement sites (e.g., Sotira Kaminoudhia, upper levels of Kissonerga Mos- philia) will be less than satisfactory. To regard this mate- rial solely in unilinear terms also precludes the option of regarding it as regional and thus at least partially syn- chronic in nature. Philia-culture sites tend to cluster in the north and northwest or else to be distributed loosely around the Troodos Massif. To understand the developmental com- plexities and chronological associations amongst them, it is essential to determine the source, extent, and rate of spread of this culture (Held i983). Because the south- western region appears to be the most remote from the northwestern core area, it might be expected to show the greatest divergence-or least degree of adoption- amongst Philia-culture sites. Spatially intermediate southern sites such as Sotira Kaminoudhia and Anoyira Trapezi reveal typological (ceramic) parallels with north- ern Philia-culture sites (Swiny I98I:84-85). Whereas rectangular or subrectangular structures have heretofore always been regarded as the hallmark of the Prehistoric Bronze Age, I988 excavations at Kissonerga Mosphilia established the presence of rectilinear build- ings in an incontrovertible Erimi-culture context (Pel- tenburg et al. i989). At Sotira Kaminoudhia, vestiges of circular elements in architecture, ground-stone cruci- form figurines and pendants, pit burials, and an array of ceramic types reveal links with the Erimi culture, whereas other developments parallel those of the Philia culture or look to the future: rectilinear structures, Red Polished and Drab Polished Blue Core ceramics, mould- cast metal weapons and tools, copper (some tin-bronze) and gold jewellery and other metal artifacts in tombs, extramural chamber tombs with dromoi, and the first attested bovine remains on Cyprus. Although the geographic heterogeneity of the Philia culture does not sit well with existing chronological schemes (nor are there yet any radiocarbon dates), the culture must have emerged in the north and center of the island about 2500/2400 B.C., where it overlapped with the Erimi culture (e.g., at Ambelikou Ayios Geor- ghios). At some still indeterminate time, the "Early Cypriot/Middle Cypriot" culture-a series of subtle re- gional and chronological variations on an islandwide theme-eclipsed Philia-culture orientations.

Because the "Early Cypriot" houses at Alambra and Kalopsidha Tsaoudhi Ciftlik have been reassigned to the early "Middle Cypriot" (Gjerstad I926:I9-37; Barlow I985) and because Swiny's (I98I) survey data-which reconsidered material from various southern sites for- merly identified by Catling (I962:I38-39, I48-54) and others as "Early Cypriot"-include no sites earlier than the latest phase of the canonical "Early Cypriot" se- quence, it is difficult to identify any facet of Prehistoric Bronze Age material culture as exclusively "Early Cyp- riot." In fact, what Herscher (I980) termed the "disap- pearing Early Bronze Age" of southern Cyprus is a phe- nomenon that should be extended to the entire island. In a similar quandary, Catling (I973:i66) noted: "Were it not for the confusion that would certainly result, a case could be argued for apportioning MC I and MC II to the Early Bronze Age, and reforming the MC period from a combination of MC III and LC I." Since, however, some developmental features in Red Polished wares and cop- per weapons or tools are apparent throughout these</page><page sequence="9">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I I55 phases, and since novel material, cultural, and economic distinctions within this era become more striking at the "Middle Cypriot" sites of Alambra Mouttes and Am- belikou Aletri, pending future stratigraphic excavation and verification the Prehistoric Bronze Age may be seen as having earlier (Philia) and later ("Early/Middle Cyp- riot") aspects. The elaborate and often unwieldy "Early/Middle Cyp- riot" ceramic taxonomy, based in large part on whole vessels from mortuary deposits in the northern sector of the island, has begun to falter in the face of accumulat- ing stratigraphic evidence from settlement excavations, particularly at Alambra Mouttes (Barlow I 9 8 5; Coleman I985:I34-40) and Episkopi Phaneromeni (Herscher I976, I98I). The standard Cypriot pottery classification system, developed early this century and still widely used, defines cultural phases in terms of predominant ceramic types: Red Polished for "Early Cypriot," White Painted for "Middle Cypriot," and Base Ring and White Slip for "Late Cypriot" (Herscher I98I:79). Although certain decorative aspects and ceramic trends-particu- larly Red Polished and White Painted-show strong de- velopmental continuity throughout the Prehistoric Bronze Age, some regions, notably the southwest and northeast (Karpass Peninsula), remained outside the mainstream tradition. Stewart (I962:III) recognized that regionally based ceramic traditions would not con- form to the standard scheme and argued that the equa- tion of Red Polished pottery with "Early Cypriot" islandwide was invalid. "Free-floating" sequences es- tablished by Gjerstad, Dikaios, and Sjoqvist and subse- quently readjusted (for the "Middle Cypriot") by Astrom to conform to his own "low chronology" (Astr6m I987; Coleman I985:I39) have now lost their theoretical underpinnings (Barlow I985:47). Barlow's studies (I982, I985) of (chiefly White Painted) pottery from Alambra Mouttes and from se- quences in Gjerstad's "houses" have established a stratigraphic framework in which tomb material may be reconsidered and through which further chronological distinctions in the Prehistoric Bronze Age may be made. Final publication of stratified remains from the settle- ments at Alambra Mouttes and Episkopi Phaneromeni (Area G) should further this development and make pos- sible a cultural sequence based on stratigraphic informa- tion and more comprehensive archaeological reasoning. Already work on the Alambra Mouttes pottery has dem- onstrated that, at least in the northern and central parts of Cyprus, the White Painted pottery tradition (II-IV, not just II) points to "Middle Cypriot I" (Coleman I985:I37), even if White Painted II is the earliest variety (Barlow and Idziak I989:74). Although Astrom distinguished linear (eastern) and tectonic (western) styles in the White Painted tradition (I957:275) and suggested that these differences might reflect intraisland cultural groups or political units (I969:76), no attempt was made to assess quantitatively the degree of interregional or intersite relationships or to define the nature of the cultural units involved. Petro- graphic and scanning-electron-microscopic analyses on Red Polished and White Painted pottery from Alambra Mouttes demonstrate selective use of calcareous and non-calcareous clays; Barlow posits both functional and pyrotechnological factors and suggests that the finer White Painted "B" wares may reflect intersite contacts (Barlow and Idziak I989:73-75). Cluster and close- proximity analyses conducted on White Painted ceramic designs also demonstrate a distinctive pattern of inter- site contacts, related by Frankel to the movement of matrilineal descent groups (I974a, b, I978). Strong links between the copper-rich Margi/Kotchati area (northeast- em Troodos) and north-coast Lapithos, on the one hand, and between the former and sites in the east/southeast, on the other, suggest that copper production and distri- bution may already have influenced intraisland connec- tions. More recently, Frankel (I988) has evaluated alter- native (commercial or domestic) models of ceramic production during this period and argued for house- hold-based, non-specialist manufacture and localized consumption. The application of such rigorous quantita- tive techniques to the northern and northwestern Red Polished ceramic tradition might reveal similar "local clusters of resource-based defence sharing units" cross- cut by "economic connections based on the exploitation of copper" (Frankel I974b:205-6). In light of his study on ceramic production and deposition, Frankel ques- tions the development of specialized production or of formal interregional exchange networks before the be- ginning of the Protohistoric Bronze Age. Kinship-based production at the household level may explain the ceramic data, but innovations in subsistence agriculture and metals technology suggest significant organisational change in the social relations of production. Were the regional cultural variations of the Prehistoric Bronze Age random, or were they related to environmen- tal factors, perhaps to socio-political divisions (Watkins ig8i:20)? What bearing did politico-economic or ideo- logical factors (e.g., copper production, wealth accumu- lation, the exploitation and exchange of secondary animal products) have upon regionalism? Broad-based consideration of material-culture developments during the Prehistoric Bronze Age helps to place these ques- tions in a problem-oriented framework. The Cypriot Bronze Age and the Secondary-Products Revolution The secondary-products revolution, as defined by Sher- ratt (I98I:263), separates two stages in the development of Old World agriculture: an initial stage of hoe cultivation, whose technology and transportational systems were based on human muscle-power, and in which animals were kept purely for meat; and a second stage in which both plough agriculture and pastcralism can be recog- nized, with a technology using animal sources of energy.</page><page sequence="10">I56 | CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 3I, Number 2, April I990 The concept of the secondary-products revolution broadly parallels much current thinking on the origins and spread of farming (Jarman, Bailey, and Jarman i982; Dennell i983; Champion et al. i984:I53-95; Barker I985:25o-64; cf. the "market" model of van Andel and Runnels i988 or the "colonisation" model of Ammer- man and Cavalli-Sforza i984). Its aim is to demonstrate that from the late 4th millennium B.C. onwards, certain innovations-such as the plough, the cart, some domes- ticated animals and their "secondary" products (e.g., wool, milk), and even the economic strategy of pastoral- ism-appeared in Europe as a "package" that had passed through much longer developmental stages in ancient Westem Asia (Sherratt i98i, i983; for an updated dis- cussion and portrayal of dispersals associated with the secondary-products revolution, see Sherratt i988:458- 63 and fig. i). The individual innovations of these "sec- ond-generation" agricultural and pastoral techniques had interacted previously and spread rapidly within Western Asia at the same time that economic accelera- tion overall led to the rise of urban communities. These developments fostered a more eclectic, differential pat- tem of agricultural production than that found in the contemporary, autonomous systems of southeastern Europe (Sherratt I986:9-II). Until more spatially ex- tensive and less labour-intensive cultivation, domes- tication, and pastoral techniques were assembled in the secondary-products package, Sherratt maintains, small- scale horticultural or metallurgical production persisted and systemic change could not occur. Chief amongst the innovations in the secondary- products package was the plough, which not only ex- tended the available cultivable land but also sustained on fallow pastoral elements that in turn provided the traction animals needed for cultivation. Forest clearing promoted livestock rearing, and increasingly all these innovations were adopted by European farming com- munities that, it is hypothesized, had reached or sur- passed optimal ecological or social limits. In suggesting that the concept of the secondary- products revolution and the adoption of innovations it outlines provide insight into politico-economic and cul- tural developments on Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus, it must be emphasized that innovations in human be- haviour do not result solely from the easing of environ- mental constraints. Changes in social organisation necessitate not only the development of an adequate subsistence base, regional exchange networks, and the associated technological innovations but also changes in perception and an increase in society's capacity to pro- cess and exchange information: "The balance between information flow and information processing capacity thus seems to keep group size always more or less in tune with organisational level. When this is no longer the case, organisations fall apart" (van der Leeuw I986:38). As people's control over their surroundings grew and human interaction with the environment de- creased proportionately, social interaction intensified and the need for efficient communication networks in- creased (van der Leeuw i986:45; Schortman and Urban i987:74). Cyprus's insularity, isolation, and lack of innovation amidst its socio-politically complex Bronze Age Aegean and eastern Mediterranean peers have long been pon- dered (Cherry i984:26-27; i986; Knapp I986a). Western Asiatic developments in agriculture or metallurgy by- passed Cyprus as island society and technology pursued their own course throughout the Early Prehistoric pe- riod. By the transition to the Prehistoric Bronze Age, however, various archaeological indicators of economic change become apparent (table 5). Since many of these factors broadly parallel Sherratt's indicators of a 3d- millennium-B.c. European economy newly expanded in the face of the secondary-products revolution (I 979: I47), it is instructive to examine them in some detail and to consider the possibility that the interactive, systemic growth of the Prehistoric Bronze Age at least in part reflects the adoption of the secondary-products pack- age.3 Developments in metallurgical technology and the first appearance of cattle make it clear that plough agriculture (the cattle-plough complex)-a "capital- expensive" endeavor (Halstead i987:84)-had been in- troduced to the island (Gjerstad et al. [I935:xix, 9] men- tion finds of cattle bones at the Khirokitia-culture site of Petra tou Limniti; if correct, this seems to have been an isolated occurrence). The gradual replacement of pigs by cattle is a feature typical of long-term change from a forested to a more open environment and a response to the development of new farming techniques (Frankel I979:9-Io; Stanley Price and Frankel n.d.; Watson and Stanley Price I977:243-44). Ploughing and other ag- ricultural scenes on terracotta "plaques" or models- one of which depicts draft animals (the bullock) and the elbow plough (Dikaios I940:I27-29, pIs. 9, I8; Karageorghis I976:Io3, fig. 69; Morris i985:figs. 488, 49I-92, 499-500)-suggest that larger, more open, hitherto unexploitable areas came under cultivation with less energy expended (Swiny I989). According to Strabo (Geographica I4.6.5), the 2d-century-B.c. geog- rapher Eratosthenes had once described forest-covered 3. Some archaeologists have expressed concem about various mate- rial, temporal, and theoretical aspects of the secondary-products revolution (Chapman i982; Chang and Koster I986:IO8-Io; Lewthwaite I987; Thomas i987:42i-22). Thomas argues that its "technological determinism" needs to be refocused on the social relations of production (I987:405-6), and Lewthwaite (i987) is concemed that it may simply be an extension of an emergence already under way locally. Lewthwaite's caveat that sophisticated concepts such as the secondary-products revolution need time for "tinkering" and maturation has been addressed by a number of recent studies (e.g., Cherry i984:24-29; Shennan I986; Thomas I987; Greenfield i988), insights from which have been incorpo- rated into the present discussion. Even if the secondary-products revolution represents no more than abstract expectations about past socio-cultural processes (Sherratt i986:13), it provides a con- ceptual framework within which one may consider at once a wide variety of material data and a specific developmental issue in Mediterranean and European prehistory.</page><page sequence="11">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I I57 TABLE 5 Archaeological Indicators of Change in the Prehistoric Bronze Age Philia Early-Middle Cypriot Innovations Differential burial practices (pit graves, chamber tombs, extramural burial) Elaboration in grave goods Mould-cast weapons, tools, ornaments Rectangular architecture (Mosphilia) Organised religious/ceremonial practices (Mos- philia) Production Ceramic Red Polished tradition with regional distinctions Red Polished, White Painted, and other regional traditions Agricultural Cattle-plough complex Terracotta models of cattle; plough and bullock; agricultural activities Ceramic shapes connected with the use of milk products (Red Polished "Philia" jugs with cutaway spout, Red Polished I "milk bowls," Red Polished III ''cream bowls" Specialized Antigorite figurines, beads-shell, gaming stones, Copper mining and manufacture ground-stone tools (axe-adze "hoard") Textiles (?

If Swiny (I98I:80) is correct to calculate (on the basis of pre-World War II statistics) that 2.5 ha of agricultural land were required to fulfill the (cereal) dietary needs of a family of six, and if much of the island, particularly the Mesaoria, was still covered by trees (Christodoulou I959:47, IO9; Frankel I974b:9-Io; Jones et al. I958:57; Held I983), there should be material indicators of forest- clearing tools (discounting "forest-fallow" cultivation, for which there is no evidence). The addition of the copper-based axe to the Philia- culture toolkit (Swiny I985c:44) and of stone adzes that imitate their flat copper equivalents (Peltenburg n.d.) is suggestive. From the lowest level of the "Unit 3" struc- ture at Kissonerga Mosphilia, a cache of 29 axes/adzes recalls finds from earlier Erimi-culture levels at Lemba Lakkous, where the adzes particularly reveal wear lines and a high-gloss cutting edge attributed to contact with soft wood (Elliott I98I:I8 - I9; Peltenburg I988:234). Fi- nally, the intensification of copper mining and produc- tion and the development of an appropriate toolkit early in the Prehistoric Bronze Age (Swiny I986a:67) may also be related in part to forest clearance for agrarian needs. Closely associated with the introduction of the cattle- plough complex was an increase in bulk-storage capac- ity, indicated by coarse-ware basins (and lime-plastered bins?) characteristic of the Prehistoric Bronze Age (Swiny 98s5 b: i 8). Storage capacity had already been de- veloped in an Erimi-culture (non-cattle) context, as wit- nessed in the stacked pithoi in "Unit 3" at Kissonerga Mosphilia (Peltenburg n.d.; I988:234). Whereas cattle and ovicaprine remains at both Sotira Kaminoudhia and Episkopi Phaneromeni make up al- most identical percentages of the faunal record, the larger proportion of young female ovicaprines suggests a milk-producing population, a suggestion borne out by a range of contemporary vessels thought to be connected with the use of milk products, particularly the Red Pol- ished "cream bowls" (Stewart i962:fig. I3I, I-9) and Red Polished spouted "milk bowls" (Stewart i962:fig. I23, io-i6), so called by analogy with modern milking pails (qaleftiri) (de Sike I982:2I, 50; Pieridou I960; Swiny I989). (It must be pointed out that the Sotira cul- ture produced bowls with tubular spouts similar to "milk bowls" [Dikaios I96I:I72-82, pls. 58, 7I].) The standard-sized, horn-lugged bowls found in close associ- ation with the storage pithoi at Kissonerga Mosphilia (Peltenburg I988:234) may have served a similar func- tion. The enhancement of the milk-producing capacity of ovicaprine herds suggested here may also have been associated with increased production of meat and wool (Cribb I987:40I). Although the production of woollen commodities-one of the first widely traded manufac- tured goods (Sherratt I98 I:283)-is not attested directly in Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus, the appearance at that time of Red Polished "plank idols" with patterned or painted decoration does point to innovation in clothing production and style (Karageorghis I976:77-79, figs. 34-</page><page sequence="12">I58 | CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 3I, Number 2, April I990 37; II2, fig. 8o [patterned]; ii6, fig. 83 [painted]; Or- phanides I988:I89, figs. i-9, and I97, fig. 26). The same faunal evidence depicts a growing depen- dence on domesticates at the expense of fallow deer (Swiny i989:table i) and-along with a large number of ground-stone querns, pounders, and grinders (Swiny i986a:65, table i)-substantiates the growth of a mixed agrarian economy. Agricultural and pastoral scenes on other terracotta models complement this picture (Morris I985:275, 278-79, 285-86; Swiny I989). Other innovations of the period, less directly related to the secondary-products revolution, include changes in mortuary practice and a dramatic increase in the num- ber, quality, and type of grave goods (Toumazou I987:203-7), an increase in site size and in numbers (from about 8o Erimi-culture sites [settlements and cemeteries] to 270 Prehistoric Bronze Age sites-not all of which would have been occupied or used simulta- neously [Swiny I989; Held Ig8ga:map D; Rupp I987; Stanley Price I979b]), and an early exploitation of Cy- prus's copper resources (Frankel I974b:203-4; I973:37- 4I; Swiny i986a:67; I989). For Thomas (I987:424), who concentrates on changes in social organisation and kinship structure in the north- ern European Neolithic, the secondary-products revolu- tion represents "a social change ... enacted through the medium of economic intensification." He associates the dramatic changes in Late Neolithic burial practice and settlement pattern with the resolution of prestige- or power-seeking contradictions in kinship-based soci- ety (I987:422-23). On Cyprus, the elaboration of tomb types during the course of the Prehistoric Bronze Age (from single-burial, often intramural pit or shaft graves to multiple-burial, extramural, rock-cut chamber tombs) as well as the increased quantity, diversity, and special- ist (metal and bone/shell) manufacture evident in grave goods certainly played an active role in social strategy and may well be related to changes in kinship structure. Items of conspicuous wealth amongst the grave goods- particularly metal items from Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba and Bellapais Vounous-reveal links between resource access, wealth, and prestige display and suggest that the basis of power relations in society had begun to change (see Thomas I987:42I-24). The metal wealth of the north-coast cemeteries during this period dramatically illustrates this suggestion and makes it possible to link the intensification of copper production to innovations in subsistence agriculture (see below). Whereas accessibility of arable land and proximity to a perennial watercourse were key variables in Prehistoric Bronze Age settlement location (Swiny I98I:8o-8I), re- cent survey work suggests that in certain parts of the island, the Erimi-culture tendency toward site clustering intensified during subsequent settlement expansion (Swiny I989, I98I; Peltenburg et al. I987; Rupp I987; Todd I988). These settlement phenomena must be re- considered not only in terms of the environmental sig- nificance of regionalism (Watkins I98i:20) but also in light of the observation that plough agriculture pro- motes more dispersed settlement, expanded settlement area, and more extensive cultivation (Shennan I986: I 17; Thomas I987:425, with further references), all of which may contribute to resolution of contradictions in kin- based society. On the one hand, Prehistoric Bronze Age sites tend to cluster: Swiny (I989) notes this feature in the northwest, north coast, western Kyrenia (Karmi- Dhikomo area), northeastern Troodos (Ayios Sozo- menos-Margi area), southern Troodos (Vasilikos Val- ley-Episkopi area), and northwestern Troodos (Stavros tis Psokas) (and see Frankel I974b:205-6). On the other hand, these regional "clusters" form part of an unprece- dented spread of settlement islandwide. The apparent paucity of settlement in the major river valleys of the southwest (Rupp et al. I986) and on the terrace deposits and alluvial soils of the southeast (Hadjisavvas I983) need indicate only that island population had not in- creased to the extent that more land was required. Cer- tainly there was no attempt to settle gorges or escarp- ments that lacked access to cultivable lands (Swiny I989). Thomas (I987:425) argues that the adoption of the plough and other aspects of the secondary-products revo- lution might only be possible in a context of social change: on Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus the cattle- plough complex facilitated exploitation of a greater vari- ety of soils, increased the supply of cultivable land avail- able to a larger population, and promoted the spread of agricultural settlement throughout the island. If gender and land/livestock relationships had remained fixed, technological innovation would have been resisted. And whereas regional site clusters may bear witness to con- tinued kinship-based social structures, other factors- the dispersal of settlements, a sustained population in- crease, and the spread of plough agriculture throughout Cyprus-suggest that communal social relations had be- gun to be transformed and that, as mortuary practices also indicate, new alliance/exchange patterns and new power strategies had come into play. The absence of (known) coastal settlements, north or south (Rupp et al. I986:34; Todd I988), and the exis- tence of only one coastal cemetery (Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba) may indicate nothing more than site function. For a society with a mixed agricultural-pastoral (milk- producing) economy and with a growing economic predi- lection for copper exploitation and production, the ad- vantages of habitation at the interface between the Mesaoria Plain and the mineral-laden Troodos foothills perhaps outweighed any need to inhabit the coast (exter- nal relations). In this context, one further aspect of the secondary- products revolution must be noted: the pack animal, perhaps the most important element in the bulk trans- port of copper (Halstead I977:268; Sherratt I98I:274; Stech I985:IO3). Ceramic models of a "donkey" with panniers, one broken from a Red Polished IV vessel's rim (now in the Ashmolean Museum), the other a Red Pol- ished III "donkey vase" (now in the British Museum), provide important-albeit circumstantial-evidence for the early exploitation and movement of Troodos copper (Merrillees I978:cover illustration; Sherratt I98I:274,</page><page sequence="13">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I I59 fig. Io, ii; Frankel I983:37, I47, no. I53). Even if the Troodos had served earlier as a barrier to intraisland communication, incipient exploitation of the sulphide ores in its northem copper belt now provided a catalyst for intersite relations and interregional trade. The metal wealth apparent in the Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba ceme- tery, the increased Prehistoric Bronze Age settlement of the eastern Troodos flanks, and the close ceramic links between Kotchati/Politiko and Lapithos may all be understood in a similar way (Stewart I962:299; Frankel I974a:48; I974b:203-4). Emergent copper production and consumption, even on a limited scale, may have provided a basis for differ- ential social relations amongst the new settlement units or clusters. Despite widespread occurrence of most as- pects of material culture, including the use of metals, there was an early concentration of metal wealth in mor- tuary deposits of sites nearest the northern Troodos cop- per (sulphide) ore bodies. Compared with the number of metal finds from Erimi-culture or Philia-culture sites and cemeteries, the 2I7 metal objects found at the "Early/Middle Cypriot" cemeteries of Bellapais Vou- nous stand out (Dikaios 1940, Stewart and Stewart I950). Even these pale, however, in comparison with the Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba finds (Gjerstad et al. 1935:33- i62; Herscher 1978): of 63 burial chambers that con- tained copper objects, 9 held 64% (n = 446) of the total (n = 701) metal finds (Swiny I989: table 2). The metal- rich Lapithos tombs not only reveal evidence for differ- entiation in mortuary practice (Keswani ig8ga:234-36, 507-12) but also suggest some degree of socio-economic inequality based on competition for control of copper resources and point to sophisticated metal manufactur- ing techniques in an advanced copper-production stage. The development of the Cypriot copper industry was closely linked to the subsistence and settlement changes-and the attendant social consequences- associated with the secondary-products revolution. One response to these changes, evident in the dispersed set- tlement pattern of the Prehistoric Bronze Age, was a growing uniformity in material culture (especially ceramics, metals, and architectural elements but also to some extent ground-stone, terracotta, and bone/shell ar- tifacts). Another, seemingly more limited response was a new concern with status and prestige. Copper produc- tion played a significant role here: as Shennan (i986: 1I7) has argued in a recent discussion of the genesis of the European Early Bronze Age, the role of metallurgy changed over time from one in which it represented so- cial differentiation to one in which its control created socio-economic distinctions. Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba's coastal location and un- paralleled metal wealth also reflect the initial stages of external demand for Cypriot copper (Swiny I989); about 30% of the artifacts from Lapithos thus far analysed by lead-isotope analysis were produced from non-Cypriot copper ores (Gale and Stos-Gale I989:253-54, pl. 63). Archaeological evidence demonstrates nearly contem- porary exploitation via deep adits of sulphide ore bodies at Ambelikou Aletri, along with evidence for copper smelting (Merrillees I984), and contemporary cunei- form records document the consumption of Cypriot (Alashiyan) copper in Syria at this time (Bordreuil et al. I984:407-8 n.Io; Muhly I986:52). Because such a situa- tion implies advances in the mining and smelting of cop- per, and the first stages of emergent social complexity on Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus, it is necessary to look more closely at isolation, interaction, and intensified copper production on the island. Growth and Impact of Copper Metallurgy The paucity of Erimi-culture metal finds (e.g., fish-hook, spiral, chisel, plaque [Peltenburg i982a]) is accentuated by the diversity of metal finds from Prehistoric Bronze Age sites. The existence of at least ten Philia-culture metal types, most with multiple examples (axes, knives, razors, chisels, pins and other personal ornaments [Swiny i986b:32]), makes it unlikely that metallurgical technology resulted solely from outside influence (Wat- kins i98i:2o; but cf. Peltenburg i982a:41-47; Stos-Gale et al. I986:1 35). Typological similarities with Anatolian metal types (Swiny I986b:37-38, fig. 3) may be related at least as much to function as to "stimulus diffusion." Reporting on finds at Ambelikou Aletri, Swiny (i986a: 67, emphasis added) writes that Slag, a crucible and two moulds were found here and although Dikaios' initial EC date should now be con- sidered as MC this site shows the earliest irrefutable evidence for metalworking on the island. There is no reason to suggest, however, that all pre-MC metal im- plements were imported, as this would be an unten- able supposition in view of the indigenous typology and sheer volume of the material. Though evidence is lacking, Cypriot metalsmiths must have smelted the local ores from the Philia culture onwards, when metal became common. In quantity and quality alike, copper objects found in mortuary contexts at Bellapais Vounous and Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba demonstrate expertise-and ultimately conservatism (Balthazar i 986a; i 986b: 655-60)-in cop- per mining and manufacture (Muhly, Maddin, and Stech I988:292). The economic significance of these sites, together with that of Vasilia Evriman and Karmi Palealona (Hen- nessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg I988), is disclosed in an- other way. On the basis of preliminary lead-isotope anal- ysis, Tomb 702 at Lapithos Kylistra seems to have contained metal artifacts of exclusively non-Cypriot ori- gin (Gale and Stos-Gale i989:25 4, pl. 63). However ques- tionable the identification of imports or limited their number, their (nearly exclusive) association with these four sites in the north and northwest during the Prehis- toric Bronze Age (table 3) confirms the dynamic role of the northern region and suggests a close connection amongst quantity of metalwork, social status and wealth, port sites and foreign demand, and copper pro- duction and export (see Herscher i98i:82; Peltenburg</page><page sequence="14">i6o I CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 3I, Number 2, April I990 i982b:ioo-ioi; Catling and MacGillivray I983:6-7; Swiny I989). The relationship of politico-economic factors to re- gional clustering and centralization deserves closer scrutiny, particularly in light of repeated suggestions that the "demise" of southwestern sites at the transition to the Prehistoric Bronze Age must have been the result of incipient copper production along the northern flanks of the Troodos and the subsequent concentration of wealth in northern sites (Peltenburg i982a:ioo-ioi; n.d.). Furthermore, how does the ceramic evidence relate to metallurgical factors of production and exchange? The distribution of metal goods and the material indi- cators of copper production reveal functional differences at two levels: settlement vs. cemetery sites and mining vs. manufacturing and/or export sites. Cemetery sites tend to exhibit the known range of metal tools, weapons, and jewellery or ornaments. There is virtually no differ- ence, for example, in the type or number of copper ob- jects per burial chamber between the northern Vounous cemeteries and the southern cemetery at Kalavasos Panayia (Swiny I989; Todd I986:I59-65). The absence of settlements associated with cemeteries, however, or with the copper-rich cemetery at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba precludes comparison of the northern "settle- ments" with the closely contemporary settlement sites in eastern and southern Cyprus. Mining and smelting activities at industrial sites like Ambelikou Aletri (or the Protohistoric Bronze Age site of Apliki Karamallos) were influential in their location: whatever the state of forest clearance on the plain or along the coasts (an unknown factor), the timber re- quired to produce metallic copper would have been read- ily available in the mountains. The primary ecological factor involved in settlement location in the northern part of the island, however, was the distribution of ore bodies. Energy, transport, and logistic factors dictated that at least primary smelting activity take place close to the mines (Stech i985:I02-3). Postulated links amongst Kotchati (near copper sources), Dhenia (en route to the north coast via the Vasilia Pass), and Lapithos suggest that the White Painted regional tradition in ceramics reflects the economic structure of incipient copper ex- ploitation and production (Stewart I962:299). Economic (and ceramic) links to the center and east/southeast may also be understood in this manner (Frankel 1974b: 203-6). Whereas the inconsistency of metals deposition and preservation must be taken into account, excavations at the "Middle Cypriot" settlement sites of Alambra Mout- tes (on the eastern slopes of the Troodos), Kalopsidha (Site C), and Episkopi Phaneromeni (Area G) have pro- duced very few metal artifacts, particularly in compari- son with cemetery evidence. The proximity of Alambra Mouttes to copper deposits in the eastern Troodos may explain the recovery there of several fragmentary cru- cibles and a few copper-based artifacts (Swiny I985 c:46); 9 of II artifacts from Mouttes analysed by the lead- isotope technique are consistent with Cypriot copper ores (Gale and Stos-Gale i989:252-53, pD. 6o). Lead- isotope analysis also indicates that three bronze artifacts from Kalopsidha are consistent with the Cypriot iso- topic "field" and so does not rule out exploitation and production from local copper ores (Gale and Stos-Gale i985:56-57). Although survey in the south-coast Vasilikos Valley has revealed a welter of "Middle Cypriot" sites and cemeteries (Todd I988, I989), which implies exploita- tion of the copper mines at the head of the valley (Todd I986:I87), hard evidence is limited to a fragmentary cru- cible and a few pieces of slag at Kalavasos Laroumena (Todd I989, I988). Southwestern surveys have plotted a "Middle Cypriot" settlement and cemetery site at Kritou Marottou Pyknopitia (A and B), in close proxim- ity to metalliferous deposits in the Lower Pillow Lava formation, but no traces of copperworking were found (Rupp et al. I986:34). Other survey work along the south coast has failed to reveal Prehistoric Bronze Age sites in the Troodos copper belt (Swiny I989). Because Prehistoric Bronze Age material from the south and southwest is so limited (Maier and von Wart- burg I985:I45-46; Carpenter i98i:60-6i; i982:30-3I, 35-37), little beyond negative evidence can be mar- shalled to support the contention that cultural develop- ments in the region were arrested by politico-economic growth associated with copper production and exchange in the north (Peltenburg i982b:ioo-ioi; Watkins i98i:2o). Present evidence nonetheless suggests that ex- ploitation of Cyprus's copper resources was a regional phenomenon, with solid evidence for production and consumption in the north and north-central region and more limited indicators of the same at Alambra Mouttes and Kalopsidha in the east. The data from Alambra, however, more closely parallel those from the slightly later Protohistoric Bronze Age settlement at Episkopi Phaneromeni (Area A) (Swiny I986a:67-68), and indi- cate what might be called a "service-and-spares" indus- try rather than metals production or use on a significant scale. Citing the paucity of metal objects, Swiny argues that an equally limited metallurgical industry typifies the early phases of the Protohistoric Bronze Age at Enkomi Ayios Iakovos (I986a:87-88). Dikaios (i969-71:502), however, described unequivocally the profusion of cru- cibles and other production debris in these early levels, and Muhly (I987) has now relocated a considerable quantity of crucible fragments amongst Enkomi mate- rial stored in Nicosia's Cyprus Museum. Metallurgical by-products from stratigraphic contexts at Enkomi, it should be added, are common from the I6th-century B.C. onwards (Stech i985:102). Furthermore, although Astr6m's "Late Cypriot I" tomb corpus reveals few metal items (Astr6m and Astrom 1972:825-31; Swiny I986a:88), Keswani's detailed research on metal finds in the Enkomi tombs reveals a rather different pic- ture (I989a:379-4I2, 708-II, tables 6.5-6.7; i989b) and suggests that taphonomic or other factors (reuse of tombs, flooding, looting) may have biased Astrom's data. By Protohistoric Bronze Age I (17th-I6th century B.C.), control over copper production and exchange had</page><page sequence="15">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I6] shifted from the north coast to an eastern coastal polity centered on Enkomi, with Hala Sultan Tekke Vyzakia perhaps of secondary importance (Merrillees 197I; Astr6m i982; Muhly, Maddin, and Stech i988:2 94). Sub- sequent developments-the legitimization, expansion, and contraction of the Cypriot copper industry in the context of the island's emergent urbanism and devel- oping social complexity-have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Knapp I988a, b). Metallurgy and Social Evolution Archaeological interpretation of the relationship be- tween metallurgy and social change has altered dra- matically in the course of the second half of the 2oth century. For Childe ( 1958), independent itinerant metal- workers-influenced by technological innovations origi- nating in Western Asia or the Aegean-helped to es- tablish the unique, practical character of European civilization. Radiocarbon dating, however, called into question the primacy of the East, and Renfrew (I973a, b) has argued vigorously over the past 2o years for local innovation in copper and bronze production, a position that now leads him to argue that Indo-European farmers (some of whom would become metallurgists) had al- ready settled Europe by the 6th millennium B.C. (I987). More recently, Gilman (i98i;i987:26) has maintained that control of subsistence resources-merely reflected in the differential distribution of metals-was chiefly responsible for social differentiation during the Euro- pean Early Bronze Age (see also Shennan i986:i17, i28). The present interpretation of developments in Cypriot copper metallurgy and social change broadly parallels that of Shennan for the European Bronze Age: the Euro- pean bronze industry matured as a result of subsistence and settlement changes associated with the secondary- products revolution, while the continued manipulation of metallurgy itself prompted further social change. Such interpretations of socio-cultural development and change provide a more balanced assessment of inter- nal developments in the context of external or interre- gional input. The adoption of innovation-whether the result of independent invention or of stimulus diffu- sion-forms part of a single process (Harris i968:378; Kelley 1971:6i). An important task of social evolution- ary studies is to consider how internal conditions facili- tate or forestall the impact of external influence on hu- man cultural systems (Bargatzky i985:29go). To place the material and social developments of the Prehistoric Bronze Age in context and to examine their relationship to politico-economic change, it must be rec- ognized that a mixed-farming economy-as represented by the cattle-plough complex and the full exploitation of domesticated (draught and pack) animals-is as funda- mental to the period in question as is copper production. Metallurgical production was only one part (but an inte- gral one) of the Cypriot Bronze Age cultural system. Un- like the situation in ancient Western Asia from the 4th millennium B.C. onward, metallurgy on Cyprus devel- oped in the context of an agrarian society that had not experienced extreme politico-economic discontinuity (cf. Stech and Maddin i988:173). Access to metal ores was much more direct on Cyprus, and metal artifacts initially may have been regarded more as utilitarian items than as exotic commodities. Moreover, the spread of innovations associated with the secondary-products revolution and the development of extractive copper metallurgy were closely related (Sherratt I986:13), an observation that has important implications for ex- plaining the proliferation of production beyond subsis- tence levels and the capital investments (table 5) associ- ated with the Prehistoric Bronze Age. The inertia of the Sotira and Erimi cultures-reflected in their settlements, artifacts, and burials-began to dis- sipate at the end of the Early Prehistoric period. As the island socio-cultural system opened up during the late 3d millennium B.C. and the ecosystem was permanently altered by human interference, copper mining and metallurgy developed in the context of an increasingly stable subsistence base. Innovations in metal tools facil- itated changes in the subsistence economy: the axe and the plough made available larger tracts of cultivable land, and in turn cattle-plough cultivation expanded the role of livestock and promoted specialized animal hus- bandry. These capital-intensive developments in the metallurgical and subsistence sectors thus combined in a positive feedback loop to promote and build an effi- cient agro-pastoral economy. As the secondary-products revolution eased environ- mental and social constraints, population increased even though demographic clustering persisted. These regional clusters exhibit a marked differentiation that must be associated at least in part with the exploitation of copper resources. The disproportionate deposition of copper ar- tifacts in north-coast cemeteries and in sites nearer the sources may reflect differing attitudes toward metals. For the miners and producers, copper may have func- tioned as a commodity; for the consumers and dis- tributors on the north coast, metals may have served as items of wealth and status (I owe this suggestion to David Frankel). In other words, for producers the value of metal lay in exchange for other goods; for the ulti- mate purchasers the value lay in prestige, wealth, and social distinction. Keswani (i989a:sio-Ii) ascribes the marked variability amongst Lapithos tomb assemblages to differences in wealth, group size, foreign contacts, and intergroup prestige rather than to highly structured, rank-related distinctions. During the course of the Pre- historic Bronze Age, competition for and control over access to both copper resources and metal items pro- vided the basis for intensified production and the growth of power differentials (see Shennan i986:i28). It seems likely, therefore, that emergent power groups established preeminence in the northern region of the island by 2000 B.C., even as technological developments in metallurgy fostered further politico-economic change and social differentiation. An innovative subsistence "package," the development of copper metallurgy, and the impact of (incipient) external demand combined to</page><page sequence="16">i61 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 31, Number 2, April I990 transform Early Prehistoric society in Cyprus. This transformation did not take place overnight, nor were its repercussions and benefits felt islandwide. Elements of regional discontinuity, rooted in power relationships and locally controlled elite exploitation of mineral, ma- terial, and symbolic resources, continued to characterize island society and material culture until a more inten- sive, urban phase developed in the last phase of the Pro- tohistoric Bronze Age ("Late Cypriot IIC," about I300 B.C. [Knapp i989, Negbi i986]) Concomitant with the Prehistoric Bronze Age trans- formation, a rudimentary differentiation seems to have developed between the politico-economic and the social sphere. Because plough agriculture may create shortages of cultivable land (Goody I976), the secondary-products model predicts a shift from a matrilineal descent system based on hoe horticulture to a patrilineal descent system (with virilocal residence) based on field agriculture and pastoralism (Sherratt 198I:297-99). The virilocal resi- dence envisaged by Frankel in the villages of Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus (I974b:2o4-5; personal communica- tion) is associated with kinship-based household produc- tion (Frankel i988:3I, 5o), a pattern that contrasts with Cypriot ethnographic evidence (patrilinear and uxori- local [Sant Cassia i985 :i8o-8I]). Because a prevailing domestic mode of production tends to inhibit the invest- ment of surplus in socio-structural change, household ceramic production may well represent differentiation in social production and another, less deterministic as- pect of intersite relationships. Conclusion As decisions about a growing network of socio-political activities became at once more distant from those activi- ties and more indispensable, decision-making began to formalise into institutions whose function was to re- lieve society's overall information load (van der Leeuw i986:42). Local control over copper production by emer- gent elites within a ranked social system provided the material base and politico-economic capacity to develop external connections or to exploit external demand. It is altogether likely that, during the course of the 3d millen- nium B.C., technological developments such as the long- boat and the sail made possible the bulk transport of manufactured goods or raw materials throughout the eastern Mediterranean on a scale previously unknown (van Andel and Runnels I 988:2 43; Liritzis I 988; Cherry i985:2I-23; but cf. Broodbank i989). Some segment of the population had to manage the requirements of production/exchange, the support of new specialists, and information transfer within an in- terregional system. Interregional interaction involves not only external demand for raw materials or other goods but also external inputs-imported utilitarian or exotic luxury goods, politico-economic alliances-that may help local power groups to maintain rank or status (Schortman and Urban i987:7I-72). In the case of Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus, internal consumption and external demand fostered competition for control over metals production and exchange, led to broader networks of contact, and provided the economic basis for the growth of power differentials. However lim- ited contacts and maritime connections may have been, new political entities in both the Levant and the Aegean were powerful enough to sustain demand for imported goods such as the copper of Cyprus or the cedars of Leba- non (see Peltenburg I985a:39-40; van Andel and Run- nels I988). New modes of social interaction began to crystallize around new subsistence and techno- economic sectors in society. The developing authority that represented these innovative sectors assumed con- trol over productive resources (copper, as prestige item or utilitarian commodity, agricultural products, import- export trade), accumulated wealth, and inevitably sharp- ened social or even geographic divisions within Cypriot society. Competition for control over copper production and exchange began in earnest during the subsequent period (see Knapp i986a:38; I979:28-54). The integra- tion of subsistence and production factors, the matura- tion of Cyprus's emergent politico-economic elite, and the ideological legitimization of its authority, are pro- cesses that unfolded during the subsequent, Protohis- toric Bronze Age. Comments JAN BOUZEK Institut d'Archeologie Classique de l'Universite de Charles, Celetnai 20, CS-iio oo Prague i, Czechoslovakia. 9 x 89 Two levels can be distinguished in Knapp's interesting study. On the higher of these it attempts to confirm some of the New Archaeology's postulates for Cyprus, calling to mind the East European archaeology of the fifties. The terminology is somewhat different, but the concern with validating the preconceived scheme at any price is familiar. There were, of course, social changes connected with plough agriculture of the Eneolithic type and with the use of metals, but there is much self- projection in the idea that "ideology" was as manipula- ble then as now, that the Bronze Age mind was closely similar to our own, and that the economy was of basic importance to the social systems of Bronze Age soci- eties. Explaining everything in terms of the material "base" does not seem a very useful approach; ancient societies were holistic entities including religion and "administrative" organisation as well as economy. All aspects of change were parts of the same stream, the key to which seems to me to be changes in the human mind. With more sophisticated agriculture and the use of met- als, humans were better able to understand the natural environment and use it for their own purposes. Deeper knowledge, however, remained with the "heroic" lead- ers at or near the top of pyramidal social structures, as in</page><page sequence="17">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I I63 Egypt and Mesopotamia. Knapp's results have their place in this framework, although an approach through the 3d-millennium-B.c. texts might be quicker and the results more detailed than a schematic picture expressed in New Archaeology jargon. Underlying this level is an interesting survey of settle- ment-pattern change in Bronze Age Cyprus in the direc- tion of the Late Bronze Age urban society, and this is of broad interest. Elements of this development accessible to archaeological study are copper mining and smelting connected with rituals and sanctuaries that gradually developed from tribal ones through the temple economy to those of small kingdoms similar to Ugarit, also known from written sources (see Aravantinos I989 and van Effenterre I989). In general, Knapp's topographical study of Cyprus and similar work elsewhere (notably Nowicki I989 for Crete) provide more information about this process than individual sites. DAVID FRANKEL Department of Archaeology, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia 3083. 25 IX 89 A century of research on Cypriot Bronze Age prehistory has been characterised by descriptive, classificatory, and chronological analyses of large quantities of pottery from tombs. The potential of this small, relatively closed system for exploring social processes has been largely neglected. In this study Knapp continues his at- tempts to redress this imbalance by integrating data and ideas into explicit conceptual frameworks in order to identify the relationship between economic factors and social structures. Part of this reassessment depends upon the restructur- ing of the formal cultural chronology devised on the basis of ceramic evidence. While I approve of Knapp's use of "Prehistoric Bronze Age" instead of the tradi- tional "Early and Middle Bronze Age" terminology, it does limit our ability to perceive temporal variation within the period and hence to establish whether change is slow and cumulative or sudden and more drastic. The older classification and chronology may be unwieldy, overcomplex, confused, and based on a limited set of data, but there are chronological differences which can be isolated and which should be built into models of change in socio-economic patterns. We are of course hampered in our attempts to break away from an in- trinsic, relative chronology by the paucity of high- precision radiocarbon dates, with the result that discus- sions of ceramic similarity still confuse temporal and cultural relationships. While stratigraphic analyses will certainly help cut this knot, in accepting these data as superior to those derived from tomb material Knapp is ignoring the multiplicity of processes-social, func- tional, taphonomic, and recovery-which affect settle- ment discard. Given his appreciation of regional varia- tion it is something of a surprise to see him accepting a few stratigraphic sequences as keys to broader chronological questions. Parenthetically, his admittedly brief analysis of the history of research fails to do Einar Gjerstad justice in this regard, as his fundamental re- search design and analysis required and used a strati- graphic underpinning for the seriation of tomb groups (I 92,6: I 9-47). An important aspect of Knapp's analysis is the use of data of different kinds, particularly the comparison of ceramics and metals. Like all syntheses, his is dependent on the concepts and interpretations of more specialised studies, but he has attempted to see these within a new overarching framework. For the earlier developments this is a valuable application of Sherratt's concept of a secondary-products revolution to distinguish the sub- sistence economic bases of Bronze Age and earlier pe- riods. I cannot, however, see why the more complex sys- tems of the prehistoric Bronze Age should be regarded as providing "an increasingly stable subsistence base." This is an important assumption, as it structures the kind of explanation used for increasing social complex- ity, suggesting an inevitability of increasing population density and concomitant changes given a solid subsis- tence base. If the more complex Bronze Age economy were to be viewed as fundamentally unstable, a very different causal explanation would ensue. Develop- ments could be seen as forced readjustments to cope with inadequate systems rather than as a consequence of plenty. Although they are briefly noted in the concluding sec- tion (and of course in Knapp's other work), more atten- tion must be given to external factors in the prehistoric Bronze Age. While I am sympathetic to the idea of seeing Cyprus as a closed system, the direct or indirect in- fluences of developments and societies elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean world demand more detailed treatment to identify the interplay between response and indigenous development. In this as in other areas, Knapp's synthesis should provoke both debate and re- search and contribute further to the transformation of Cypriot archaeology. STEVE 0.

A detached view of the recent history of Cypriot ar- chaeology might reveal that if the Late Bronze Age (Pro- tohistoric Bronze Age) has been oversubscribed and the early prehistoric period traditionally suffered from be- nign neglect, the intervening Early and Middle Bronze</page><page sequence="18">I64 | CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 3I, Number 2, April I990 Age (Prehistoric Bronze Age) periods have had to bear the peculiar affliction of a complacency brought about partly by the existence of a reassuringly neat ceramic typology (Astrdm I957, Stewart i962) and partly by the perceived lack of significant advances toward urbanism and complex trade and exchange networks that was taken as evidence for a rural, unstratified, and static (read "backward") island society. Occasional quibbles over chronology did little to disturb this placid state of affairs as long as they could not be put in the perspective of a chronometric database (cf. Astrom I987). The old Dikaios-Stewart controversy about the relationship be- tween the Philia culture and the Early Cypriot remained unresolved and, since the archaeological record was grossly biased toward burial sites and thus rendered it virtually insoluble, was temporarily shelved. Scant at- tention was paid in the I970S to Frankel's (I973, I974a, b, I978) social inferences from his important quantita- tive analysis of White Painted pottery decoration, and the ramifications of Herscher's (I976, I980, I98I) and Swiny's (I979) work on south-coast ceramics have long begged for a holistic reassessment of cultural region- alism and identity in the prehistoric Bronze Age. As if to make up for two decades of stagnation, the last few years have witnessed a revival of sorts, with excavations at Kissonerga Mosphilia and Sotira Kaminoudhia high- lighting once again the intractable problem of the Philia culture and thus of the spatio-temporal beginning of the metal horizon on the island. At the same time, a spate of diverse investigations involving or arising from new ex- cavations (Coleman I985; Barlow i982, I985; Barlow and Idziak I989; Todd I986), field surveys (Rupp I987; Rupp et al. I986; Todd I988, I989), and reexaminations of old material and issues (Frankel I988, I989; Keswani I989a, b; Merrillees I984; Ross n.d.) during the last five years not only has produced new food for thought but, more significant, shows an increasing willingness to think in (for Cypriot archaeology novel) terms of process and context rather than traditional idiographic tem- plates. All these individual strands of recent research are brought together effortlessly and perceptively in Knapp's article. The vehicle he has chosen to advance his view of a dynamic role of Prehistoric Bronze Age society in the Cypriot culture sequence, Sherratt's secondary-products revolution, seems plausible as long as it is remembered that, as a model, it should not pretend to explain culture process but simply act as a heuristic device for establish- ing a conceptual framework in which to arrive at such an explanation. Hence, while I would agree in principle with its use as the prime mover for a sudden accelera- tion of culture change (which, incidentally, fits the pro- posed shortened, calibrated time span of the Prehistoric Bronze Age like hand in glove), the current dearth of direct settlement evidence-particularly in the form of bioarchaeological data (see table 2)-for the period under discussion makes me wonder whether the second- ary-products revolution really allows a meaningful inter- pretation of the Cypriot record merely by virtue of its a priori plausibility as a concept (cf. Murray and Walker's [i988:249] reference to the "opaque relationship be- tween meaning and plausibility in archaeology"). More- over, I profess a feeling of unease at the use of such pithy terms as "package" and "revolution" in connection with the Philia culture and the Prehistoric Bronze Age, for while it was surely not Knapp's intention to stir up old ghosts, some closet diffusionist is bound to misconstrue his line of argument as support of the claim that the Bronze Age of Cyprus began in Anatolia. Philosophical misgivings aside, in my view Knapp's article suffers from three weaknesses-two methodolog- ical and one factual-without succumbing to them as a less trenchant argument undoubtedly would have. First, endeavoring to present a balanced view, Knapp pays lip service to the idea of cultural continuity between the early and late prehistoric periods, paraphrasing a state- ment by Hennessy that "Prehistoric Bronze Age culture was deeply rooted in its agriculturally based predeces- sor" and making passing mention of Early Prehistoric material precedents for ostensibly innovative Prehis- toric Bronze Age traits such as the spouted bowls of Sotira-culture Combed and Painted-and-Combed ware and the recent discovery of rectilinear architecture in Erimi-culture contexts at Kissonerga Mosphilia. For ob- vious reasons, however, these references are rather terse, since to stress continuity and internal development across the Erimi-Philia transition would be to undercut the argument for widespread innovation during the Pre- historic Bronze Age. The objection here must be that although the Prehistoric Bronze Age admittedly can be credited with two momentous technological innova- tions-full-fledged metallurgy and the cattle/plow "complex"-evidence from Souskiou Vathyrkakas and Kissonerga Mosphilia now suggests ever more strongly that the beginnings of socioeconomic transformation reach back far beyond the mid-3d millennium B.C. into the main phase of the Erimi culture (ca. 3500-2800 Cal. B.C.). To subscribe to this view is not to reject the idea of accelerated developments during the Prehistoric Bronze Age but to deemphasize the singular causality that Knapp postulates for that concept and to suggest that a development threshold preparing the ground for some of the Prehistoric Bronze Age innovations had been reached already by the late Erimi culture. The second methodological weakness is revealed by the cursory treatment accorded the environmental as- pects of the secondary-products revolution. The East Mediterranean, an open sea containing only a single, oceanic island (Cyprus), has a very different configura- tion and hence presents very different navigational prob- lems and opportunities from the Aegean archipelago, with the result that nautical developments stipulated for the latter cannot automatically be presumed for the for- mer. For this reason I find it altogether unlikely that, as Knapp speculates in conclusion, the Cycladic longboat played a role in increasing the island's contacts with the outside world. It has recently been hypothesized that the use of longboats in the Keros-Syros culture may have put considerable strain on the limited manpower of cir- cumscribed island societies and that instead of being</page><page sequence="19">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I I65 utilized for bulk trading, for which vessels of much wider beam (i.e., of a type suggested by the Cypriot White Painted II boat model [Buchholz and Karageorghis I973:47i, no. I7i8]) would have been more suitable, their purpose was to serve as symbols of social status and (in an Early Cycladic form of gunboat diplomacy) to project the political power of central places (Broodbank I989:330-3I, 335-37). The use of larger and/or more stable vessels in the 3d millennium B.C. is also envisaged in connection with the cedar trade between Byblos and Early Dynastic Egypt by Hockmann (i987:58-6i), who goes so far as to postulate that Cyprus was routinely circumnavigated by these early merchantmen on their return journey to the Nile Delta. This hypothesis throws an interesting sidelight on Knapp's discussion by de- scribing one possible mechanism of the island's integra- tion into an emerging East Mediterranean trade network during the Prehistoric Bronze Age. Alas, it is not backed up by literary evidence until Wen-Amon's account in the 2oth dynasty (i ith century B.C.), nor does it fit the archaeological record. On the contrary, the putative im- ports/exports listed in table 3 do nothing more than tes- tify to sporadic water crossings. Beyond that, there is not a shred of evidence, direct or otherwise, for regular, for- malized maritime contacts between Cyprus and the sur- rounding mainland prior to the early 2d millennium B.C. or, for that matter, for the existence at that time of an East Mediterranean trade network involving long- distance sea crossings into which the island might have been drawn. As Knapp himself has pointed out else- where (e.g., i985:24I, 246-47), these developments did not take place until the transition from the Prehistoric to the Protohistoric Bronze Age, and it would be mislead- ing to regard the East Mediterranean basin before then as a maritime transaction sphere of scattered polities in the sense in which this is possible for the Aegean. In the facts ledger, there are a few errors and sweepers that more thorough checking might have caught. The reference to Simmons (i988) is irrelevant to the con- text in which it is made, and Sotira Kaminoudhia has yielded not "ground-stone cruciform figurines and pendants" but merely a single incomplete cruciform figurine of antigorite. An initial date for the Philia cul- ture of 2500/2400 B.C. is merely an educated guess; a more straightforward explanation for the incised decora- tion found on Red Polished plank-shaped idols than the one offered by Knapp is that it simply reflects a popular ceramic style; and the claim for a growth in site size during the Prehistoric Bronze Age is contradicted by the scant data embodied in table 2. These are minor com- plaints that should not detract from the gist of the arti- cle. If Knapp's intent was to pose a germane question, few would deny that he has succeeded. Yet whether the secondary-products revolution provides the framework for obtaining a verifiable answer cannot be determined without a surge in settlement data, a condition unlikely to be met any time soon. This ought to give Knapp am- ple opportunity to elaborate on the present study, for, as he knows well, "the moving finger writes and, having writ, moves on.1" EDGAR PELTENBURG Department of Archaeology, University of Edinburgh, 16-20 George Square, Edinburgh EH8 gJZ, Scotland. I7 x 89 Knapp has made significant contributions to the debate on the development of complex society in Cyprus, and here he extends those studies in an evaluation of the poorly understood incipient stages of such development. The major novelty of his problem-oriented study is the application of Sherratt's (I98I) secondary-products- revolution model to the data. This leads him to conclude that the new subsistence "package" combined with the development of copper metallurgy and the impact of external demand to transform Early Prehistoric society in Cyprus. The argument is compelling, but does the evidence, particularly with regard to the secondary- products revolution, sustain it? As Knapp asserts, there are serious weaknesses in the intractable Cypriot evi- dence, and so perhaps greater stress needs to be laid on the tentative nature of his conclusions. While full of useful insights, the case remains a hypothesis to be proved rather than a solid foundation on which to build. My aim in highlighting reservations is to draw attention to the poor quality of the data rather than to question the secondary-products revolution and metallurgy as likely causal forces for change. The latter has for long been acknowledged as a key to socio-political development on the island (Stewart i962: 288-go). Essential evidence for the secondary-products revolu- tion includes depictions of the elbow plough with draft oxen and cattle bones. The former are limited to the north of this highly regionalized island, and the latter require more detailed presentation. They come from two sites, Sotira Kaminoudhia and Episkopi Phaneromeni. Regarding the former, the excavator warns that "the small size of the samples calls for caution" (Swiny i989:28); the Episkopi samples are from Area A (Car- penter I98I:65), which falls outside the period under discussion (see below). Hard evidence is even weaker than these statements suggest. We are not told where the cattle bones at Sotira come from. Only one area, A, has pretensions to belonging to the Philia culture, and even this is a contentious issue which affects many other parts of the argument. Non-specialists should be alerted to the fact that although the excavator now pre- sents the site as a Philia settlement, no new evidence has been forthcoming since he stated that careful study would have to be undertaken to establish its relationship to other sites (Swiny i985a:I2I). Knapp proposes the secondary-products revolution as a prime mover for change, yet many of its alleged effects are already visible in the archaeological record before the arrival of this new technology. Increases in the number of sites, in the number and size of forest-clearing tools, and in the use of bulk storage and growing uniformity in material culture are all demonstrable in the preceding period. That he is aware of these earlier progressions is evident from the text and table 5, where Mosphilia is incorrectly included in the Philia-culture column; all</page><page sequence="20">i66 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 31, Number 2, April I990 Mosphilia entries in fact belong to the preceding Erimi- culture period. It should also be emphasized that all en- tries under "Innovations" save mould-cast weapons oc- cur at Souskiou or Kissonerga Mosphilia, well before the appearance of cattle in Cyprus. This unfortunate ambi- guity is also evident in the identification of the Mos- philia date in table 4 as "transitional between the Erimi culture and the Prehistoric Bronze Age." The construc- tional timbers in question come from Building 3, wholly within the Erimi-culture tradition (Peltenburg i986:29). One conclusion to be drawn from these observations is that significant courses towards complexity were in train well before the secondary-products revolution and that the situation accords better with Lewthwaite's (i987) suggestion that the latter is an extension of change already under way. Knapp is surely correct in stressing the interaction be- tween subsistence changes and the continued manip- ulation of metallurgy, which itself prompted further change, but, as I have suggested above, there were proba- bly other catalysts at work. Catling (I973), for example, noted increased population as the cause for certain changes. While demography by itself is unlikely to have promoted complexity, more attention to it and to the appearance of fortified sites is warranted. No mention is made of the frequently suggested arrival of a new popu- lation at the start of the Prehistoric Bronze Age. Such newcomers are likely to have brought with them a well- established secondary-products package, and consequent changes in social organisation may thus have been im- planted in finished form. If this should prove to have been the case, we would need to look at the more com- plex process of acculturation and innovation on a site- by-site basis. While in one sense, therefore, we need more theoreti- cal propositions to test, we also need to be aware that reliable data are still too scanty to confirm or refute such propositions satisfactorily. To take but the question of the chronology of the few sites that supply data, the Pennsylvania dates from Episkopi Phaneromeni come from Area A, which, as Knapp concedes, belongs to his Protohistoric Bronze Age; they do not belong in table 4. The dates from Alambra Mouttes (providing an average of I783, not i8ii, Cal. B.C.) place it within the final stage of the Middle Cypriot according to Knapp's text (i.e., post-i8oo B.C.) and hence after the period that he treats. Yet according to table i that final stage only be- gins about I700. Setting aside these inconsistencies, we still have to admit that it is difficult to put sites in chrono- logical order and hence to assess the mechanics of change. Where there is a dearth of detailed and pertinent infor- mation, as in this period, there is an understandable ten- dency to treat assumptions as supportive arguments. This should be resisted. For example, Knapp states that there is an overlap between the Philia culture and Am- belikou Ayios Georghios, an important assertion that requires corroboration. A possible source for it may be Gjerstad's (ig80) misguided reassessment of the Am- belikou pottery, one that has already been dismissed (Peltenburg i982a:58). Knapp (along with Swiny I989) has demonstrated the need and rewards of going beyond a pot-centric interpre- tation of this period. He has articulated a plausible model for one stage of the transformation from simple to complex society in Cyprus, one that now needs to be tested by systematic fieldwork. ALAN H. SIMMONS Quaternary Sciences Center, Desert Research Institute, P.O. Box 60220, Reno, Nev. 89506, U.S.A. i6 x 89 Knapp sharply criticizes traditional Cypriot archaeology for its focus on ceramic seriations, arguing that empha- sis on a single material-cultural element has resulted in inflexible chronological sequences bearing little rela- tionship to cultural reality. This, of course, is not a prob- lem restricted to Cyprus. Ceramic sequences are strong indicators of cultural variation and change throughout the world. A problem emerges, however, when sterility sets in; classifications are comforting icons, and ar- chaeologists are well known for their resistance to change. Individual researchers' biases and training are important here. In the Americas, for example, ar- chaeological inquiry has a strong anthropological back- ground, and as a result there have been some innovative approaches to ceramic variation. The anthropological perspective has perhaps allowed a more problem- oriented, rather than object-oriented, approach. There is no one right way to look at material-cultural variation, but, once interpretation becomes rote and static, as Knapp implies it has for much of Cypriot archaeology, it is time for a new perspective. He offers one, including a deliberate break from traditional terminology that, while it may make for difficult reading, is a welcome change. I must caution, however, against one of his "solu- tions." He correctly calls for more emphasis on radiocar- bon chronologies, but we should not rely on this too strongly. Although radiocarbon dating may add a scien- tific cachet to archaeological interpretation, it is no panacea. For example, I have i 5 radiocarbon dates from a single early site in Cyprus, yet there is still considerable controversy about its chronology. Knapp's discussion of the reasons for the rise of social complexity in Cyprus is thought-provoking. Certainly there are aspects of it that require fine-tuning, but his application of the concept of the secondary-products rev- olution is intriguing. He considers the emergence of cop- per-bronze metallurgy and its impact on political and economic organization and change in a framework founded in several diverse fields, including formalist economics, social history, and political anthropology. His examination is sure to make some scholars wince, but it also will make them think. Knapp alludes to Cyprus's insularity and isolation dur- ing the Bronze Age. This observation can be extended back to the earliest periods of its occupation. Insularity is, however, curiously underemphasized in most of his discussion. He acknowledges the unique constraints im-</page><page sequence="21">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I I67 posed by islands but does not fully develop them. I ques- tion the applicability of the idea of a secondary-products revolution to Cyprus without more consideration of the island variable. The secondary-products "package" included the plough, which allowed more efficient cultivation, often extending into areas previously uncultivable. Coupled with the plough was the use of cattle, not only as food sources but also as draft animals. While Knapp sees the plough/cattle complex as critical in the emergence of complexity, he does not underrate coeval developments in social and political arenas. His analysis brings one aspect of Cypriot archaeology squarely within the realm of modern archaeological theory and therefore deserves careful attention. Reply A. BERNARD KNAPP Cambridge, England. I4 x 89 Like Cypriot archaeology itself, the comments reveal ex- tremes of approach and so provide instant opportunity for my "moving finger, . . . having writ," as Held quips, to "move on." With the exception of Bouzek, the com- mentators offer useful, constructive, minimal criticism of my attempt to examine the material database within an explicit politico-economic framework in order to con- sider socio-structural continuity and discontinuity on Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus. Because, on the one hand, the "New Archaeology" seems to serve as a scapegoat for Bouzek and because, on the other, its scien- tific, philosophical, hypothetico-deductive stance would have precluded a study like this one, that commentator and I are already at an impasse. Indeed, the differences between my approach to Mediterranean archaeology (Knapp I988c) and his hyperdiffusionist one are so pro- found that little of value would result from a detailed exchange of opinions. Nonetheless, I shall not hesitate to draw upon his comments where the discussion warrants. For purposes of synthesis, it seems useful to respond to the commentaries under three rubrics: chronology/ evidence, economy, and external contact/insularity. Since I eschewed an approach that relies on typolog- ical divisions and the endless splitting of Cypriot artifac- tual groups into (often) baseless temporal pigeonholes, Bouzek makes no comment on chronology. With regard to the anthropologically inspired, problem-oriented ap- proach advocated by Simmons, it must be noted that, with the exception of Stanley Price (e.g., I979a), who is no longer active in Cypriot archaeology, the only three researchers to have explicitly adopted such an approach (until very recently) are Simmons (I988), Held (I989a), and Frankel (esp. I988). In his discussion of chronology theory, Smith (I987, n.d.) argues convincingly that ar- chaeological chronologies must be fluid, not fixed, and should be regarded as working constructs that will pe- riodically have to be modified or abandoned. In contrast, it is clear that those who have constructed Cypriot chronologies will defend them inflexibly (e.g., Pelten- burg n.d.) and even bitterly (e.g., Merrillees I985:I5-I6). In calling for an emphasis on radiocarbon chronology I did not intend to suggest that it was a panacea. Without a significant increase in the collection and prompt analy- sis of short-life material suitable for accurate radiocar- bon dating, however, we shall never be able to construct an absolute chronological framework in which to assess material-culture continuity and discontinuity in Early Prehistoric and Bronze Age contexts on Cyprus. More important, it is essential that Cypriot archaeologists de- velop a consistent attitude toward radiocarbon dating: at present there is a distinct tendency-rooted in skepti- cism over the reliability and precision of radiocarbon dating in various laboratories-to dismiss radiometric dates unless they conform to preconceived notions of cultural sequences or "events." Frankel's statement that "there are chronological dif- ferences which can be isolated and which should be built into models of change in socio-economic patterns" has been put into practice only by Frankel himself (as noted in the section "The Sequence of Cultures") and more recently by Keswani. Held underscores this by reiterat- ing that the detailed ceramic studies undertaken by Herscher and Swiny (on south-coast "styles")-firmly based in stratified settlement evidence and survey work-have yet to be integrated in any meaningful way into a study that reassesses regionalism (or, I would add, that seeks to refine chronological sequence). Such a topic offers suitable scope for a Ph.D. dissertation: my intention was solely to call attention to these issues and so to suggest an alternative for those better-equipped than I to deal with the ceramic diversity of the Prehis- toric Bronze Age. Peltenburg's concern about the chronology and cul- tural placement of some key sites in this discussion must be addressed briefly, for the sake of specialists. Because I sought in table 2 to portray a wide chronolog- ical and material range of evidence, I could not at the same time provide detailed information on precise quan- tities in each data category. Peltenburg's point about the limited nature of the faunal evidence is well taken, but this should be apparent from table 2; I have discussed the issue in more detail elsewhere (Knapp n.d.). The lim- itations of the evidence, however, must no longer be used as an excuse to forestall interpretive overviews of the type offered here. Turning to individual sites over which Peltenburg ex- presses concern: he states that most innovations cited for the Philia culture (table 5) are attested at Kissonerga Mosphilia (a point made clearly in the text) or at Sous- kiou Vathyrkakas (similarly Held), "well before the ap- pearance of cattle in Cyprus" (emphasis added). The question is: what does Peltenburg mean by "well be- fore"? Within the proposed I,soo-year time span of the Chalcolithic Erimi culture (3900-2400 Cal. B.C., or, ac- cording to Peltenburg [n.d.], 3800-2300 Cal. B.C.), we have only the vaguest relative or absolute chronological</page><page sequence="22">i68 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 3I, Number 2, April I990 hooks on which to hang much of this evidence. The sole radiocarbon date from Kissonerga Mosphilia (2539 Cal. B.C.) falls squarely within what Peltenburg regards as (regional) Late Chalcolithic (2800-2300 Cal. B.C.), just preceding what I regard as the initial date for the Philia culture, about 2500/2400 Cal. B.C. (Held rightly calls this an "educated guess"). "Well before," in other words, could mean anything from IOO to I,OOO calendar years. I therefore adopted the unsatisfactory solution (to Pelten- burg an "unfortunate ambiguity") of suggesting that the latest phases at Kissonerga Mosphilia were transitional Erimi culture/Prehistoric Bronze Age (table 4): at the moment I can see no other way to move beyond this temporal-regional conundrum, which has stalled discus- sion on other important issues. Furthermore, the obvi- ous conclusion to be drawn (but one which Peltenburg cannot accept) is that late-phase Kissonerga Mosphilia in the southwest is at least partially contemporary with Philia-culture sites in the north and northwest, perhaps even with Sotira Kaminoudhia in the south. With respect to the debate over the Philia-culture as- sociations of Sotira Kaminoudhia, until it is proven otherwise I accept the assessment of the excavator (Stuart Swiny, Cyprus-American Archaeological Re- search Institute), just as I accept fully Peltenburg's ad- monitions over the cultural placement of the late phases at Kissonerga Mosphilia, where he directs excavations. There is no question (pace Peltenburg) that both the dates and the material from Alambra Mouttes fall squarely within the Prehistoric Bronze Age (Coleman n.d., Knapp n.d.). The five dates from Episkopi Phanero- meni Area A pose other problems and fall into a grey area that archaeologists-with a black-or-white mental- ity-are loath to acknowledge. The dates lie within the Prehistoric Bronze Age, but the excavators (Carpenter, Swiny, Herscher) view the material as belonging to what is here termed Protohistoric Bronze Age I. In effect, this situation exemplifies the intractability of much of the Cypriot material, the paucity of radiocarbon dates, the rigidity of chronological schemes, and (unusual with Cypriot excavations) the absence of final publications on key settlements (especially Phaneromeni and Mouttes). Peltenburg himself has characterized the situation ap- propriately: "we still have to admit that it is difficult to put sites in chronological order and hence to assess the mechanics of change." Whereas I shall allow, with Frankel, that mortuary evidence has the same potential as stratified sequences for shedding needed light on issues of both regional vari- ability and chronological division, this will only even- tuate in the Cypriot case if research is conducted with a specific problem orientation (e.g., Keswani I989a, b) rather than with the more typical descriptive one (e.g., Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg I988). Furthermore, I regard stratified (settlement) evidence not necessarily as the "key" (as Frankel assumes) but rather as a significant and heretofore unavailable "clue" to the study of broader chronological and cultural questions. Turning to factors economic and the relevance of the secondary-products revolution as a conceptual frame- work in which to consider developments in Cyprus's Prehistoric Bronze Age, I think Andrew Sherratt will be surprised to learn that (according to Bouzek) there were similar tendencies in the East European archaeology of the fifties. By stating that my attempt to explain every- thing in terms of the material base is "not very useful," Bouzek reveals only that he has misunderstood the main thrust of the study, namely (as Frankel recognizes), to examine the relationship between Cypriot political economy and social structure. For his part, Frankel approves of the application of the secondary-products concept to Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus but observes critically that the developments as- sociated with it need not result in an "increasingly sta- ble subsistence base." Certainly the Bronze Age econ- omy of Cyprus might profitably be reconsidered as one that had to cope with the stresses resulting from a some- what "sudden" entry (by the end of the Prehistoric Bronze Age) into the eastern Mediterranean interaction sphere. Yet the basic subsistence changes noted in this study take place before the major internal and external economic expansion of the Cypriot polity that occurred at the transition to the Protohistoric Bronze Age. Fur- thermore, until archaeologists on Cyprus are willing to invest the time and effort necessary to retrieve regularly (and analyze promptly) the botanical and faunal data that will make it possible to integrate concepts of risk and "bad-year economics" (Halstead and O'Shea I989) into evaluations of emergent Cypriot politico-economic complexity, this question must remain open (for fuller discussion, see Knapp n.d.). Although Simmons finds my use of the secondary- products concept "intriguing," he suggests that the "unique constraints" (biological? social? spatial?) associ- ated with Cypriot insularity and isolation call into ques- tion its applicability (yet in the end he gives a theoretical stamp of approval to the secondary-products revolution and, more important, notes the links to socio-political structure and change). Peltenburg is equally concerned that the hypothetical nature of the secondary-products revolution-and the tentative nature of any subsequent conclusions-be clearly expressed (see n. 3). As origi- nally conceived and recently reiterated, the secondary- products model has claimed "wide predictive value throughout the Mediterranean" (Sherratt i98i:293), and Sherratt has referred directly to Cyprus with respect to a few aspects of his original formulation (i98i:267, 274, 280). With regard to the western Mediterranean island of Sardinia, Lewthwaite (i986:29) has noted: "the premise that the later third and early second millennia B.C. wit- nessed an expansion of the pastoral sector closely ac- cords with the model of a Secondary Products Revolu- tion advocated by Sherratt." The difference between Simmons (and Held) and my- self on this point stems in part from what Held terms "the long-standing methodological rift between early and late prehistoric research on the island." The calls of these prehistorians (in the fullest sense of that word), whose current and critically important fieldwork at Ak- rotiri Aetokremnos relates directly to the earliest colo-</page><page sequence="23">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I i69 nisation (?) of the island (or rather to an early exploita- tion of its faunal resources?) (Held i989b, Simmons I988, Simmons, Held, and Reese I990), for more empha- sis on the concept of insularity and on principles of is- land biogeography and human ecology are legitimate but somewhat misplaced in the Bronze Age context. None- theless, I believe that these concepts and others that may be derived from the careful study of coastal and insular settings in Melanesia may fruitfully be pursued in examining the course of later Cypriot prehistory and protohistory (see below). Both Held and Peltenburg imply that I use the second- ary-products model as a "prime mover" to explain Pre- historic Bronze Age cultural process and change. In fact I link it explicitly to other key productive (metallurgical), exchange (foreign demand) (both noted by Peltenburg), and social factors. Furthermore, given our current inabil- ity to focus more sharply on temporal change during the Prehistoric Bronze Age, nowhere do I suggest a "sudden acceleration of culture change" (Held) propelled by the adoption of the secondary-products package. This mis- representation leads directly to issues of cultural con- tinuity and discontinuity, and both Held and Peltenburg take me to task here: the implication is that, because I am concerned not to undercut arguments for innovation during the Prehistoric Bronze Age, I portray the Erimi- culture-Prehistoric Bronze Age transition as sudden and discontinuous. I am not simply "paying lip service" to the idea of cultural continuity between Early Prehistoric and Bronze Age Cyprus (Held) or trying to deny that certain aspects usually associated with the secondary- products package existed in incipient form in the preced- ing Erimi culture (Peltenburg): on the contrary, these points are stated unequivocally in each case in the text and listed in table 5. I should maintain, furthermore, that in human behaviour generally significant changes (gradual or in certain cases punctuated) are inherently plausible in a situation of basic cultural continuity. The archaeologist's need for black-and-white solu- tions again comes to mind: discontinuity demands ex- planation, all too often in the form of some external factor, and so Peltenburg adopts the materially baseless and largely discarded (except by Swiny) diffusionary de- vice of the arrival at the beginning of the Prehistoric Bronze Age of "newcomers," who are "likely to have brought with them a well-established secondary-prod- ucts package." Held's views are much more salient here: I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that a "development threshold" had been reached during the Erimi culture (similarly Bolger i988:I27-30) and have indicated as much elsewhere (Knapp i988d:ii). Erimi-culture devel- opments, however, have traditionally been presented and discussed chiefly in prescriptive (e.g., Bolger I988: I30-32) or descriptive (e.g., Peltenburg I987) terms, and it is difficult-for a non-specialist-to tie them into the sort of framework I have erected for the Bronze Age. It would be most valuable to have a problem-oriented discussion and evaluation of this material, and a contribu- tion from Held along these lines is eagerly anticipated. The issue of Mediterranean Bronze Age exchange sys- tems has bearing on discussions of economy and pro- vides a useful link to the consideration of external con- tacts and insularity. Although Bouzek calls for the use of 3d-millennium-B.c. documentary evidence as a source of information on Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus, it must be pointed out that there is no textual evidence from Cyprus or reference to Cyprus in any Egyptian or cuneiform document from the 3d millennium B.C. I have cited the cuneiform documents (from Mari in Syria) rele- vant to the Prehistoric Bronze Age and in a variety of other publications have collected and discussed all eth- nohistoric evidence that pertains to Bronze Age Cyprus (e.g., I979:I5I-286; I985; i986a). Bouzek appears to be unfamiliar with these publications and likewise un- familiar or unconcerned with a monographic study and a more explicitly theoretical treatment of the relationship between metallurgical production and "religion" on Pro- tohistoric Bronze Age Cyprus (Knapp I986b, I988a). His suggestion that we view developments in Cypriot Bronze Age metallurgy in terms of the evolution from a tribal to a temple economy is not without interest, but to base such a view on the temple economies of ancient Western Asia or the political economy evident at Late Bronze Age Ugarit not only reveals a serious misunder- standing of the available evidence (also Muhly i986:42) but also reflects a widespread tendency to look at Cyprus through lenses coloured darkly by preconceptions founded on cultural praxis in the nearby Aegean or the Levant. I do not deny the importance of external factors or the need to consider the "interplay between response [to them] and indigenous development" as a result of "di- rect or indirect influences of developments and societies elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean world" (Fran- kel). In fact, this study assembles for the first time all the published evidence (documentary and material) indica- tive of exogenous contact during the Prehistoric Bronze Age (material evidence in table 3). Because, however, Held and Simmons (in contrast to Frankel) adopt a min- imalist position on external contact and insularity, it is useful to clarify my position. To the extent possible, it is essential to portray and assess Prehistoric Bronze Age Cypriot material and cultural factors in their own terms and to refrain from imposing upon them social or eco- nomic models developed for the contemporary Aegean or the Levant (for similar concerns about the Protohistoric Bronze Age, see Muhly i986:42-43). Yet the proposal to con- sider the suitability of the secondary-products concept in the Cypriot context implies some sort of communica- tion with other areas of the eastern Mediterranean. The natural circumscription of the island of Cyprus and the scarcity of land and resources that resulted from extensive plough agriculture and increased exploitation of copper had far-reaching sociocultural implications (concentration of resources and centralization of author- ity): at or near the threshold of the Protohistoric Bronze Age, biospatial constraints related to insularity and the initial colonisation of the island can only be considered within the context of politico-economic and technologi- cal factors that may have eased certain of these con- straints. It has been demonstrated, furthermore, that dis-</page><page sequence="24">I70 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 3I, Number 2, April I990 tance and locational factors had minimal impact on Cyprus's key market position during the Protohistoric Bronze Age (Portugali and Knapp i985), and I would ar- gue that the same holds true on a more modest scale during the Prehistoric Bronze Age. Constraints-both environmental and social-may also be regarded as po- tentials, continually mediated by human intervention (Earle i989:87), human decision-making, and human need. The interrelationship amongst external impact and indigenous developments requires a much fuller, more focussed study: my intention was to stimulate fur- ther debate along these lines (Frankel), not to make scholars "wince" (Simmons). On Cypriot participation in Mediterranean interaction spheres, one cannot deny Held's observations on Cy- prus's unique (eastern Mediterranean) spatial configura- tion and the navigational constraints and potentials at- tendant on its "oceanic" insularity (more fully developed in Held i989b), particularly vis-a-vis the Ae- gean archipelago: here Held and I are of one mind and one methodology, which have implications for all of Cypriot (Early and Late) prehistory and protohistory. There are some misunderstandings and contradictions, however, in Held's discussion of Cyprus's external con- tacts and the role of the longboat in Bronze Age Mediter- ranean transport and exchange. Broodbank's (i989, cited by Held) otherwise superb study of the Cycladic long- boat is marred by its necessarily selective use of Oceanic and especially Melanesian ethnographic and archaeolog- ical evidence. As Sherratt (i989:348) has noted in a re- view of a simulation study that relies heavily on ethno- graphic as opposed to empirical evidence, "A little ethnography is a dangerous thing." In order to substantiate plausible suggestions for the social and ideological functions (not necessarily the pri- mary function, I hasten to add) of the Cycladic longboat, Broodbank cites Irwin's work on the Mailu (Broodbank I989:336 and n. 72; Irwin I978a, b, i985). Over nearly half a millennium, the Mailu maintained a regional mo- nopoly on trade along southeastern coastal Papua New Guinea, at least in part through the use of their swift ocean-going canoes. One of Irwin's main concerns was to demonstrate that location-marginal or maximal- promotes specialised trade (i985:242-43; I978b). Allen (I977, i984, i985), in contrast, maintained on the basis of his excavations at Motupore (near Port Moresby) that a monopoly on trading-supported by voyaging skills and the use of dugout canoes-may have facilitated set- tlement in agriculturally marginal areas. In spatial and ecological terms, Mailu and Motupore were both small and impoverished, but their centricity within a regional interaction sphere allowed them to function as middle- men and to supply goods in demand to their regional trading partners (Knapp i988-89). Within island Mela- nesia, similar developments occurred in the Amphletts (Irwin i983:70-7I), in the southern Massim area (Pers- son i983:44), and in the Siassi islands (Lilley i985, i988). Intensive maritime trading networks existed through- out south-coastal Papua and island Melanesia, and the (ecologically diverse) societies involved exhibited con- siderable similarity in specialised production (including dugout canoes) and in the types of goods exchanged (e.g., shell valuables, boar's tusks, stone axes, obsidian, large trees for canoe construction, hardwood bowls, and wo- ven baskets). These specialist traders both mobilised and exploited demand. For example, the Motu, who domi- nated the hiri exchange system along the south-central Papuan coast, provided sago acquired from the Papuan Gulf region to other trading partners inland or southeast of Port Moresby (Oram i982; Allen i984:432-39). The 125-km-stretch of coast frequented by the Motu at the time of contact (late igth century) linked them with other regional systems to the west (hiri) and east (provid- ing shell valuables). Like other specialist traders, the Motu transported a constantly changing variety of im- ported goods as well as their own specialist products in dugouts such as the lagatoi (used in the hiri system-see Oram i982:pls. I-4) within a regional exchange sys- tem whose configuration was always in flux (Allen I985:5 I; see also papers by Bulmer and Rhoads in Dut- ton i982). Yet the economic and spatial complexity of these Melanesian exchange systems was not reflected in the social system: production remained at the household level, and social stratification never developed (ranking existed only on a very limited scale and was based on differential access to resources). In fact, Melanesian pro- duction and exchange systems served chiefly to provide subsistence and social status, not "wealth" or "power" in the Western senses of these terms. Such "wealth" as remained after elaborate pageants of display and presta- tion was never reinvested in commercial growth or in the centralization of authority but rather was consumed through a culturally sanctioned process of status acqui- sition or "spent" to provide the wherewithal for future maritime endeavours. (These points are elaborated and some analogies between Mediterranean [especially Cypriot] and Melanesian systems drawn in Knapp I988-89.) The point of this Melanesian digression is that what- ever the functions of the Cycladic longboat, the Melane- sian dugouts served not only for trading and raiding but also to fill basic subsistence and social needs. Held has perhaps unintentionally misrepresented Broodbank's ar- gument, and I suggest that the real value of the latter's study is to force reconsideration of possible alternative functions for the Cycladic longboat. If anything, citing the Melanesian data undermines this argument, for only by bending the evidence in a Eurocentric direction could Melanesian watercraft be regarded as symbols of power, much less exemplars of "gunboat diplomacy" as sug- gested by Held. In my estimation, Renfrew's (I972:357- 58) assessment of the Cycladic longboat as a multifunc- tional vessel stands. The dearth of evidence for Bronze Age maritime (or, for that matter, land) transport in and around the Mediterranean is matched only by the scarcity of reli- able research effort in this regard. To suggest, as Held does, that a certain (Cypriot ceramic) boat model may reflect one vehicle used for bulk transport is unobjec-</page><page sequence="25">KNAPP Production, Location, and Integration in Cyprus I I7I tionable in itself, but to which sort of bulk transport does he refer? If it is to a bulk trade in metals, Muhly has demonstrated that such a trade developed only during the Protohistoric Bronze Age (Muhly, Maddin, and Stech i988:28i). Held seems insufficiently aware of potential contra- dictions when, on the one hand, he cites Hockmann to suggest that "early merchantmen" (whatever this refers to in material reality) may have routinely circum- navigated Cyprus on their return journey between Byb- los (on the eastern Mediterranean coast) and the Nile Delta in Egypt (were these "Byblian merchantmen"? why would they have travelled round Cyprus?) and, on the other hand, states that formalised maritime ex- change systems did not develop prior to the early 2d millennium B.C. (which-as he notes-remains my own position). There exists, nevertheless, unequivocal mate- rial evidence for increasing and intensifying foreign con- tact during the early 2d millennium B.C. (later phase of the Prehistoric Bronze Age), and, contrary to Held, docu- mentary evidence for the use of Cypriot copper in Mari and Babylon during the i9th-i8th centuries B.C. also indicates an active maritime exchange system in the eastern Mediterranean (newer references in this study; see also Knapp i986a:52, n. 2 and 3; i985:249-50). An interregional interaction network had emerged in the eastern Mediterranean by the early 2d millennium B.C., even if Cyprus's role therein was initially quite lim- ited. Even when that Cypriot presence became more in- tensive, I see no evidence for wholesale cultural entrain- ment of the sort suggested by models such as "peer polity interaction" (Renfrew and Cherry I986; Knapp i986c:4), even as Cyprus underwent-at the transition to the Protohistoric Bronze Age-the most discontinu- ous cultural trajectory since its colonisation. This factor highlights yet again the need to assess indigenous politico-economic and cultural developments within their broader Mediterranean context. Rather than preach to the converted or risk alienating those actively involved in Cypriot archaeological fieldwork, I conclude with the mild suggestion that, de- spite an intractable material database and a tradition that has on occasion been willing to provide ready an- swers to complex questions stemming from that data- base, Cypriot archaeology could profitably be expanded in the direction of efforts to understand politico- economic and cultural continuity and discontinuity. Processual as well as post-processual research is applica- ble to all areas of Cypriot archaeology and to all stages of Cypriot pre- and protohistory. Most commentators (and Mediterranean archaeologists generally) will recognize the theoretical nature of this essay and realize that I have attempted only to erect a framework in which to reconsider some questions germane to the incipient stages in the development of complex sociopolitical and economic institutions on Bronze Age Cyprus. If I have raised more questions than I have answered, that is the nature of archaeological research; if I have provoked Cypriot archaeologists to consider certain issues more closely, I have accomplished my purpose.
