<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS ern eyes (which is quite a different kettle of fish), it is impossible to discern it from this illustration. Similarly, certain pictographs of the lower Pecos (Diablo) region of Texas are said to bear a "strong likeness" (p. 31) to Style 2 petroglyphs of the Glen Canyon region. A study of the description of Style 2 petroglyphs (p. 6) fails to reveal any convincing similarities except possibly that anthropomorphic figures are "poorly executed" in both. If we turn to the illustrations for help, we find that Fig. 8 is captioned as having Style 2 petroglyphs; but the middle section of this photograph is lightstruck, and the mountain sheep which do happen to be clearly visible are not present in any lower Pecos paintings. Other Style 2 illustrations are equally faulty; either the photo- graphs are not clear or it is impossible to find the alleged similarities. In short, Turner fails to make a convincing case for the relationship between Style 2 petroglyphs and the lower Pecos pictographs. It is difficult to assess the accuracy of the other relationships Turner proposes, either because of defective illustration or because the descriptive terms employed are puzzling and imprecise. It is said of Style 3, for example, that ". . . its complexion is a retrogression from the plasticity and peerless extensi- bility of Style 4" (p. 6). This publication is also badly marred by numerous typographical errors and/or misspellings. These begin with "diefication" (twice) in the Abstract (p. xi), and six others were casually noted by the time page 36 was reached, on which page an entire line seems to have been lost. At this juncture the enumeration of such sins was abandoned, since it seemed likely that the total would be embarrassingly high. While a reviewer can hardly pass over such short- comings as are mentioned here, it should also be made clear that this study is a positive contribution to our knowledge of North American rock art and that it sug- gests prehistoric connections between Glen Canyon and other regions which should be more carefully and pre- cisely studied in the future. W. W. NEWCOMB Texas Memorial Museum Austin, Texas Empires in the Dust. ROBERT SILVERBERG. Chilton Books, Philadelphia and New York, 1963. vii + 247 pp., 8 pls. $4.95. This is written by a professional writer who has pro- duced numerous books on archaeology, science fiction, and biography. It is divided into six chapters, each de- scribing the archaeological discovery of a given ancient people: Egyptians, Hittites, Harappans, Phoenicians, Etruscans, and Incas. The bibliography consists, as one would expect, of secondary sources. The question one raises is, "Why such a book?" In the first place, there has been a plethora of such books on the market since World War II, and this is among the poorest of them. Secondly, the book is filled with cliches and inaccuracies: "Egypt is a vast treasurehouse of the past"; "The whole civilized world shook at the news that Babylon had fallen"; "The Aryans . . . were rude and barbaric, but not unintelligent. They realized they had much to learn from the older peoples they had conquered.... So the lore of the Harappans passed to the Aryan successors." If the writing were distinguished and not journalistic, much might be overlooked in view of the ever-present need to make known the discoveries of archaeology. There is nothing to recommend this book except the hope it raises that fine writers will someday use this material in the distinguished way it deserves. WALTER A. FAIRSERVIS, JR. University of Washington Seattle, Washington Pueblo Period Sites in the Piedra River Section, Navajo Reservoir District. Assembled by ALFRED E. DrrTERT, JR., AND FRANK W. EDDY. Museum of New Mexico Papers in Anthropology, No. 10, Museum of New Mexico Press, Santa Fe, 1963. 122 pp., appendix, 62 figs., 16 tables. $4.00. This report consists of a brief explanatory chapter and four site reports - the Candelaria site by Frank W. Eddy, the Serrano site by James J. Hester, and the Railroad and Martinez sites, both by James V. Sciscenti, Alfred E. Dittert, Jr., and Beth Dickey. These sites are along the Piedra River in Colorado and were excavated as part of a salvage operation connected with relocation of a railroad and a county road that were within the Navajo Reservoir pool limits. Much of the excavation was accomplished with power equipment. The sites were carefully selected (from the 24 endangered) because each was deemed particularly representative of one or more aspects of the local occupational pattern. In the Navajo Reservoir district, the defined cultural units or periods are the Paleo-Indian, Archaic (3000- 500 B.C.), Pueblo (A.D. 1-1050), and Navajo (A.D. 1550- present). The Pueblo period is divided into five phases: Los Pinos (A.D. 1-400), Sambrito (A.D. 400-700), Rosa (A.D. 700-900), Piedra (A.D. 850-950), and Arboles (A.D. 950-1050). The four excavated sites here reported fall within the Pueblo period (the Navajo period is lightly represented at the Martinez and Railroad sites) but do not include Los Pinos or Sambrito manifestations. The Candelaria site represents a short occupation in- dicated by two isolated structures (a pit house, used both for domestic residence and ceremonial purposes, and a masonry surface-storage structure). The single- unit pueblo site, of which the Candelaria site is repre- sentative, is most typical of the Navajo Reservoir. On the basis of ceramic types (dates determined on the basis of tree-ring dates associated elsewhere), this site is assigned to the early part of the Piedra phase (A.D. 850-900). The Serrano site consists of two groups of superim- posed pit houses and a staggered row of very poorly 357</page></plain_text>
