<plain_text><page sequence="1">WVhiteness pervades the work of British artist Michael Craig-Martin. It is there in the white formica of his 1960s sculptures and in the white light of certain neon sculptures of the 1970s. It surfaces in the large areas of unprimed white canvas of a set of "paintings" from 1976 and finally on the white walls of galleries, brilliantly and evenly lit, that provide the ground of his wall drawings. For these the gallery walls are a transforming cinematic screen on which ordinary things are blown up to a grand scale and stripped of incidental detail. Artists are often haunted by memories of childhood, and Craig-Martin's work betrays a nostalgia for the simplicity of outline drawing, the reassurance of clear, pleasing shapes, and elements of the stable architecture of daily life, such as tables and chairs. Among his memories are the LayAbed Books, a series of children's books once popular in England, which are filled with clever drawings, some hidden behind cunningly fold- ed pages. These are not a "source" of his art in the way comics are for the work of Roy Lichtenstein; but, like certain kinds of comics, they showed how complex things could be rendered by apparently simple means. In Craig-Martin's work we see a special kind of outline drawing, unaccented but crisp, used to describe a variety of common objects brought together in ways that arouse our interpretive faculties with the promise of meaning. "Pictures," Craig-Martin has written, "take place in us." Picturing requires not only that we be able to make a picture of something in reality, but that we be able to rec- ognize something as a picture, a completely artificial process, governed by rule and convention. Pictures are complicated by their relation to other pictures and to lan- guage. An aspect of picturing that has preoccupied Craig-Martin is the way it can, in Arthur Danto's phrase "transfigure the commonplace." The simulated Brillo boxes and soft typewriters of the Pop artists are important examples of this kind of process. Born in Ireland, raised in the United States, and educated at Yale in the 1960s, Craig- Martin avidly studied the work of contemporary American artists, particularly Jasper Johns and Robert Morris, during those years. To him it remains fresh and radical, and it continued to inform his work after he returned to England, in 1966, to take a position at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham. His work is thus a kind of American art grown in an English garden. This is not meant to imply that it is somehow less serious or more pic- turesque than the American, but it has the look of being carefully cultivated, and for this reason evinces a greater awareness of the artificial character of form. It also conveys modesty and clarity of thought rather than ambition, skepticism rather than belief. In the late 1960s Craig-Martin made some wooden boxes that are an antidote to the seamless constructions of Minimalism. Hinged with lids that were either reversed or which were incapable of closing, these boxes imply the impossi- bility of creating a hermetic form. Later, he played the role of skeptical participant in the Conceptual art movement in England, a movement that included the sculptors Richard Long and Barry Flanagan. All were exhibited together in the 1972 exhibition The New British Art, perhaps the most significant showcase for new English art in the 1 970s. Shortly after this exhibition, which identi- fied Craig-Martin with Conceptual art, his work began to change. In 1975 he made his first wall drawings depicting objects like globes, light bulbs, hammers, and tables, magnified in size and rendered with a sharp, unmodulated line. In select- ing objects to be drawn, Craig-Martin would choose the model, from all those available, that was the least obviously "designed." Through a series of drawings he would methodically simplify his ren- dering of the object until he arrived at a final version, which he would then fix by tracing it with architectural drafting tape onto plastic. When enough of these drawings had accumulated, he could combine such images to compose a larg- er drawing. The last step was to make a slide of this final drawing, project it onto a wall, and trace it with tape. It is tempting to describe the wall draw- ings as a combination of Pop and Minimalism, but that misses the subtle way in which they resist these defini- tions. In contrast to the Pop artist, whose taste runs to images already stereotyped by the mass media, Craig-Martin prefers to begin with a rendering of an actual object. Similarly, his way of composing is Dy 0obeD By Robert Evre-n 14</page><page sequence="2">Installation view, 1980, Rowan Gallery. London. Left: Reading (with Globe). 1980. Tape on wall.

Collection of the artist. far from that of the systematizing Minimalist: the arrangement of images in the wall drawings is largely intuitive, a matter of feeling and appearance, trial and error. An artist working in intuitive fashion is naturally aware of the many possible associations arising from the images and techniques at hand. Despite the austerity of Craig-Martin's work, his objects have anthropomorphic qualities. For example, he has said he thinks of Reading [with Globe] (1980) as a kind of family portrait. The objects in it crowd together, opening themselves up to the viewer, like the book, or crowding others out, like the light bulb. The space of this picture, if we disregard the relative scale of objects, is the shallow stage of the painted portrait or of the studio photograph. Reading [with Ironing Board] (1980) might be described as Craig-Martin's "Japanese picture" for the way in which it floats against the screen of the wall, suggest- ing deep space but without the cues cus- tomarily given in Western art. In this comic drama an open book stands apart from the cluster of objects at the center. These seem to bunch together against the aggressiveness of the sexually sug- gestive ironing board at the upper right. In other drawings Craig-Martin uses objects principally for their associations, or in order to flesh out a particularly complex spatial structure. This movement between objects as sources of form and objects as reposito- ries of thought or feeling is like an alter- nating current whose fluctuating intensi- ty provides a source of energy for the wall drawings. The viewer experiences this alternation as a contest between the presence of the objects depicted and the means with which they are presented, which seem curiously immaterial. The cir- cuit between real objects, their represen- tation in pictures, and the viewer's deci- phering of these pictures is the subject of the wall drawings; it is a lucid fable about the way in which the mind and the object are reconciled in art. Projects: Michael Craig-Martin (through April 24) was organized by Robert Evren, Curatorial Assistant, Department of Drawings. The Projects series is made possible by generous grants from The Bohen Foundation, the Lannan Foundation, The Contemporary Arts Council of The Museum of Modern Art, and the National Endowment for the Arts. Additional support for this exhibition has been provided by The British Council. 15</page></plain_text>
