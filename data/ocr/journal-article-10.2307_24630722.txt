Memoirs of the research department of Toyo bunko 50, p. 1-28. While there are a number of excellent studies on the city-god (chenghuang-^ % ) before the Ming, this is the first exploration of the subject. Two major changes are found during the period : city-gods are organized in accordance with the imperial administration ； and smaller city-god temples on the township level emerge for the first time. The first change is due to the complete reorganization of all city-god temples undertaken by the Hongwu emperor in 1369，immediately after his ascendency, and then again a year later, in 1370. At this time, all city gods were formally enfeoffed by the central government, given formal titles, and ranked in a system of first five, later three levels, paralleling 398</page><page sequence="2">REVUEBiBUOGRAPHiQUE de Sinologie 1993-1994 Philosophie et religions the structure of the state administration. City-gods in this context were often treated similarly to the deities of mountains and rivers, i.e., lost some of their anthropomorphic character. However, this move was not undisputed and different political factions preferred different types of city-gods. In addition, city-gods for the first time became specialized for things other than cities. There was, for example, the chenghuang of the Salt Distribution Commission. Beyond that, smaller townships, newly developing with the increasing commercialization of Jiangnan, created their own city-gods，representing the community vis-a-vis the vertical structure of central administration. The modern form of the city-god was thereby developed. “ uwiAKCm UVIAK(^N</page></plain_text>
