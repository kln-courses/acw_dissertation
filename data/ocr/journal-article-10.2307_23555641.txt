<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON MUSLIM-JUDAIC RELATIONS: WERE THERE ANY? Studies in Islamic and Judaic Traditions Rd., William M. Brinner and Stephen D. Ricks. Brown Judaic Studies Series. Atlanta, Georgia: Scholars Press, 1986, xiii, 273. ISBN 1-5554-00485. One of the major handicaps of our institutional education in the study of religion is that we have been trained in either "Islamic," or "Judaic," or "Christian" studies, and that our departments of theology or religious studies teach "Islam," "Judaism," and "Christianity" as rather closed, autonomous entities, reflecting their adherents' general view of them. It is rare to take Arabic as well as Hebrew, to study the Islamic as well as the Judaic tradition:' not to speak of combining these languages with Greek and Latin and studying the Christian tradition as well. It has also been rare to find a scholar-teacher in these branches especially interested in religious norms and practices, dreams and Copyright © Jaques Waardenburg 1990.</page><page sequence="2">135 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 2/1 (1990) ideologies, who is free from bias or does not project them onto the materials. Another rare commodity among teachers and students of religion is the capacity to look at things from another's point of view, to understand the intentions behind other people's expressions, and to grasp meanings from within another cultural setting and tradition—to look in on one's own tradition from outside, so to speak. As a natural capacity this seems to have been lost, and replaced by attendance at well-circumscribed meetings of dialogue and shared experience where only those are admitted who have clearly recognizable identities and loyalties. Rare, finally, are those who have any sense of relationships, especially between people of different traditions and loyalties, and who are curious to see what happens when these different groups and peoples meet. Looking at both parties with unbiased eyes means having to take a hard look at oneself too, and unavoidably starting to ask questions that are awkward within one's own habitual world. Yet, notwithstanding these handicaps and the common tendency to obsession with one particular tradition, mostly one's own, increasingly people are needed who can study Muslim-Christian relations, Jewish-Christian relations, and Muslim-Jewish relations as well without preconceptions. In fact, the whole network of what I would like to call Jewish-Christian-Muslim (JCM) relations is in need of scholarly inquiry and study. The case of Muslim-Jewish relations is special in the sense that the Jewish communities living in Muslim countries, unlike the Christian minorities, had no recourse to a foreign power which could offer a refuge or if necessary intervene. How have the relations between Jewish minority and Muslim majority communities and individuals (for until this century the relationship has always been this way around) been studied, and which particular problems occur when such a theme is the focus of inquiry? This book provides food for thought as far as both these questions are concerned. A first reading of the essays contained in it cannot fail to impress the reader: the variety of subjects treated, the results of long-term research concisely presented, the erudition contained in so many notes</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 136 with copious references. On second reading, however, one becomes aware of some gaps in a collection which one may hope will initiate further research. A survey of the evolution of the study of Judaic Muslim relations, say from Abraham Geiger to Bernard Lewis, would have been appropriate, as well as some information about the source materials available for the study of these relations for the medieval period, such as the Geniza documents. Furthermore, the very notion of (Islamic and Judaic) "tradition" needs to be discussed: were there, in the medieval era, in contrast to 19th and 20th century developments, two firm bodies of established normative tradition constituting what each community considered to be its religion? Or was the historical reality that the two different traditions constantly referred to the (revealed) sources of religion while numerous subsidiary trends, mystical and philosophical for instance, are also historically attested even though they may not have been acknowledged by the representatives of the central Law tradition? Within such a broad concept of "tradition," mutual influences, interactions, and parallelisms between Islam and Judaism can be studied in detail. Indeed, one of the disappointments of any volume of disparate contributions is that the reader is left to situate them within a wider, significant whole on the basis of what is understood by "tradition" rather than by accepting without further ado the much more evaluative, and scientifically doubtful, notion of Arab-Jewish "symbiosis." Any reader interested in Muslim-Judaic encounters, meetings and interactions would look for some further theoretical distinctions too. Throughout the volume, which is entirely oriented towards materials in the broad field of sacred, legal, and philosophical texts from the medieval period, one would have liked to see a clear distinction between the historical situations and conditions within which people lived, met, and wrote one the one hand, and their texts, the tradition within which they stood, and the message they convey on the other. In other words, much more information is needed about the contexts of these texts. Another distinction which one would have liked to see respected throughout, is that between the fact and nature of encounters between Jews and Muslims (or "Islam") or between Muslims and Jews (or "Judaism"), and the way in which those concerned perceived and</page><page sequence="4">137 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 2/1 (1990) evaluated such encounters. And precisely when we have to do with the meeting of two religions, or two religious civilizations, a formulation and comparison of the two basic religious structures (which at first sight seem to be so similar) is appropriate. Why in the medieval religious setting "dialogue" was impossible in some areas (there was a tendency here to despise the other party's religion in absolute terms), and why a social, cultural, or other interaction was not only possible but actually took place in others, becomes then a legitimate scholarly problem. By distinguishing what in given circumstances a particular person or group held to be absolute and more or less completely opposed to what was seen as the other party's religion (thus justifying the rejection or non acceptance of that religion), the area where creative interaction could take place would have stood out more clearly. These second or third thoughts on the part of a more theoretically and methodologically oriented reviewer can be summarized as follows: the volume as a whole, and most of the individual contributions contained in it, offer much "technical" scholarly know-how and findings, but lack a more reflective dimension which could have put it in a much stronger position in opening a virtually new field not only by ascertaining facts but also by suggesting ways to proceed in studying such facts. But rare are books of scholarship where the reflective dimension is present yet not dogmatically fixed. The papers in this volume are among those which were read at four meetings organized by the Institute for Islamic-Judaic Studies, founded in 1981 by the University of Denver's Center for Judaic Studies. As the Center's Director, Dr. Stanley Wagner writes, these meetings were intended "to provide a scholarly forum, free of political overtones, in which Muslims, Jews and Christians can amicably pursue and share their research in Islamic-Judaic Studies" (vii). The meetings, inspired by S. D. Goitein's vision of the "great Jewish-Arab symbiosis," focused on scripture, law, and philosophy. Their starling-point was the ways in which the Muslim and Judaic religious civilizations have interacted on a number of levels, as Professor William M. Brinner formulates it. Instead of belittling the originality of one religious civilization in favour of the other, research needs to be directed to their fruitful relationship. One cannot but sympathise with meetings in which participants of</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 138 various persuasions "[have come] together under the banner of scholarship to shed light on the past in the hope that the future, too, might be brighter as a result" (xi). Turning now to the book itself, I will give particular attention to those papers which apply new approaches promising for the study of interactions between Judaism and Islam and between JCM religious civilizations generally. SECTION ONE: NARRATIVE AND EXEGESIS (four papers) Mahmoud Ayoub starts out by discussing Muslim commentators' various interpretations of Sura 9:30, which states that the Jews consider Ezra ('Uzair) as a "son of God," which is obviously not true. The question of what is done in religious traditions with texts in their Scriptures which are contradicted by well-established facts is worth pursuing more systematically. Beyond this particular text, Ayoub pleads for a fresh approach from within the Islamic tradition to the many verses in the Koran dealing with the Children of Israel and the Jews. Muhammad's routing of the Jews of Medina is well-known, but according to Ayoub's somewhat poetic treatment of essentially tough verses, the "Qur'an leaves much room for discussion" (6). Gordon D. Newby starts out from a reference in Sura 11:42-43 to a son of Noah who refused to board his father's ark and subsequently drowned. Who was this son and what are the sources of the story? Newby's method is to search for materials from ancient Judaic tradition which are analogous to early interpretative traditions of Koran texts in tafsfr (exegetical) literature, on the assumption that Muslims, in attempting to understand texts referring to Hebrew Bible figures, made use of particular ancient Judaic traditions, the so-called Isra íliyyál. This is part of the broader aim of Newby's research, "to understand the nature of Arabian Judaism around the time of the rise of Islam" (22). The treatment of Sura 11:42-43 is a nice example of his procedure. Ingeniously, but not, I think, absolutely conclusively, Newby contends that "the Arabian Jewish community" would have known the Henoch material which he uncovers through his analysis of Midrash literature</page><page sequence="6">139 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 2/1 (1990) around Genesis 9:20-27 (Noah's relation to Enoch-Metatron, the mythical background of the Flood story, etc.). Newby has subsequently published a book on the history of the Jews in Arabia, which, unfortunately, we have not yet been able to consult.2 Fascinating and promising is Andrew Rippin's approach to Sa'adya Gaon's Arabic Hebrew Bible translation, in particular the story of Isaac's sacrifice. The translation was made at a time when the Jewish community in Mesopotamia was probably too Arabacized to have access to the Hebrew original and the Aramaic targums of the Books of Moses. The problem at hand is what can be learned from this translation and its use of Arabic about Sa'adya's attitude to the Muslim religious environment in which he lived and which had by then reached a cultural peak. Rippin contends that Sa'adyaconsciously intended to integrate Judaism into its Islamic context. His acceptance of terms which had specific connotations in the Islamic theological context and his use of plain, clearly understandable Arabic, together with some interesting details of the Isaac story, all point in this direction. Here and there Rippin detects Sa'adya's apologetic concerns such as his intention to give way as little as possible to current Muslim approaches of anthropomorphism in the Hebrew Bible and resisting the Muslim doctrine that a former revelation could be abrogated by a later one (naskh). Sa'adya also lays great stress on the rational character of the Law. Thus a careful analysis of his Hebrew Bible translation allows Rippin to reconstitute Sa'adya's attitude not only to the religious vocabulary current in the Muslim world in which he lived, but also to other prominent Jewish, Christian, and generally non-Muslim thinkers who wrote in Arabic (or Persian), in order to find out how they interacted with their Muslim surroundings. In her comparative treatment of the Joseph story as narrated in the Koran and Genesis, Marilyn Robinson Waldman applies a kind of analysis quite different from the older "influence and transmission" studies which considered earlier versions as normative and unique, and later ones as derivative and lacking in originality. It also differs from those approaches which intend to show the superiority of the story of Genesis 37-46 according to religious criteria. Here we have a pondered approach in three phases. First, the author makes a remarkably lucid</page><page sequence="7">Reviews 140 comparison between the Hebrew Bible and the Koran, the place of each Joseph story within both, and between Biblical and Koranic narrative in general, both with a significant predilection for direct speech. Second, she presents an analysis of the Koranic story, paying special attention to Joseph's fitting within the general characteristics of messengers in the Koran, the subplot of Joseph and Zulaykha, and the typical relationship between the "instrumental" messenger and his God, between human action and divine will as coordinates of the vision which lies behind the Koranic Joseph story. And third, she provides a comparative analysis of the two Joseph narratives in an Appendix, according to 19 steps constitutive of the story of which Hebrew Bible and Koran present two variants. This approach lends itself to application to other narrative materials in the Hebrew Bible and the Koran as well. SECTION TWO: RELIGION AND LAW (six papers) This section starts with William M. Brinner's treatment of Sura 17:22-39 (shorter form in Sura 6:152-154) as the Islamic "equivalent" of the Decalogue contained in Exodus 20:1-17 (cf. Deuteronomy 5:7 21). Brinner also identifies Sura 53:13-18 as referring to Muhammad's meeting with Allah (with reference to sua and tafsi'r literature), comparable to Exodus 33:18-23 which describes Moses' meeting with God. After having shown that there is no ascertainable influence of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 on the Koran, he demonstrates convincingly that the Koran has its own indigenous equivalent of the Ten Commandments, "as a revelation of Allah to Muhammad within the context of Arabian society" (71). He finally hints at the striking similarity between the basic moral and ethical codes contained in both Scriptures. With methodological rigour Brinner formulates what may perhaps be called a Golden Rule for future Islamic-Judaic studies: that similarities "are often not so much an actual borrowing from the Jewish tradition as a response to it and to the long Jewish presence in Arabia" (67). If only this rule had been formulated some hundred years ago! In a lucid presentation Joshua Halberstam inquires how supererogatory actions are treated and evaluated in both the system of Halakha and that of Sharf'a. Such kind of actions, which obviously</page><page sequence="8">141 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 2/1 (1990) cannot find a place in western legal systems, constitute a special category in religious law, described in the terms of each respective system. Recognition of such actions is significant insofar as they suggest a personal autonomy and give room for religious and ethical creativity. Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, employing a more classical "orientalist" approach, investigates the occurrence of a special terminology for the concept of "renewal of religion" in medieval Islam. She shows that the expression tajdiil al-dt'n and its equivalents (tajdfd cd-sunna, etc.) have no deep roots in medieval Muslim writing, though they appear more often from the 11th century onwards (before the Crusades). She suggests Jewish sources for its occurrence at that time, when Jewish communities also started to speak of renewal of religion. The reader may wonder if it may not just have been in the air at that time? The study is confined to the problem of terminology, for which a certain number of representative texts have been consulted. It may be, however, a good starting-point for further studies about what was understood by a "renewal" in both religious traditions in the course of history. David S. Powers analyzes one of the few known instances in which two scholars of repute, a Muslim and a Jew, studied each other's Scriptures. It concerns Ibn Hazm and Ibn Negrellah, contemporaries at the end of the Umayyad caliphate in Spain. In fact, they turn out to be not disinterested scholars but religious polemicists, intent on undermining intellectually the other's Scripture's claim to be Revelation. This sad story inspires Powers to the hope "that the adherents of these two major religions will begin to read one another's sacred texts from a non-polemical perspective" (118). The same may be said of Muslim Christian polemics concerning the Hebrew Bible and the Koran, where the very aim of reading the other scripture is not to read its original message. Working in a quite different field, Stephen D. Ricks judiciously treats the legal bars to marriage, based on consanguinity and affinity, as they occur in Judaism and Islam. After a careful study of the relevant texts in Deuteronomy, Leviticus, and hcdakhic literature on the one hand, and Koran and fiqh literature on the other, he concludes that there</page><page sequence="9">Reviews 142 is an astonishing similarity. The main differences are that in Judaism uncle-niece marriages are allowed and (he institution of the levirate marriage exists, both of which are prohibited in Islam, and that in Islam fostering (generally restricted to suckling in infancy) is seen as a bar to marriage. Ricks discreetly suggests a possible influence of rabbinic Judaism on the shaping of Muslim legislation on marriage bars. As this paper shows, further studies ought to be carried out on other comparative issues in Halakha and Shari'a. Farhat J. Ziadeh gives an account of al-Kha§§afs Adah al-qcidi, translated as "The discipline of the judge," of which he published an edition with commentary in 1979. It concerns a sort of handbook for judges' practices in matters of court procedure and organization, a genre of writings hardly studied until now. It would be interesting to have an analogous Judaic text. SECTION THREE: PHILOSOPHY AND THE ROLE OF MAIMONIDES (five papers) Raphael Jospe draws attention to the ethical doctrine of a Jewish philosopher less known than Maimonides, the 13th century Shem Tov ibn Falaquera. Over against Maimonides, who strives to give both intellectual apprehension and moral judgement their due place in his thought, ibn Falaquera in the end arrives at a negation of ethics altogether and a positive emphasis on asceticism and solitude, a position rarely held in the Jewish tradition. Jeffrey Macy, studying the political thought of Plato, al-Fâràbï and Maimonides, analyzes what these thinkers say about the relationship between the rule of law and that of wisdom—a well-known theme in Greek and medieval philosophy. Compared to the other philosophers, Maimonides is distinguished by his concern to preserve the Jewish Law in which even a prophet cannot make a permanent change, without risking being "put to death as a false prophet" (229, n. 61). Alfred L. Ivry, in a perceptive study of tolerance in Judaism and Islam, asks whether tolerance in a radical sense (involving a separation of religion from government) is possible at all within the confines of Islam and Judaism. In the wider sense of indulgence for other beliefs,</page><page sequence="10">143 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 2/1 (1990) however, tolerance has occurred; in Islamic history it has taken the political form of "toleration" vis-à-vis those people who were perceived as monotheists. But Judaism and Islam, which were both conceived originally as political entities, have never arrived at disestablishing religion as a political institution. This would open the way to tolerance in the more radical sense of not privileging one religion politically above others. Whereas it is true that the legal traditions of both religions do not give thought to a possible separation of religion from the state, there are other traditions within the two communities that have been concerned with it: mystical and philosophical circles. More importantly, there have been a great number of historical precedents, especially in Islamic history from the Umayyad dynasty onwards, for a de facto separation due to state policies. These instances can very well serve as historical precedents for a separation between religion and state. Moreover, in modern times both Islam and Judaism have witnessed movements which have implicitly offered alternatives to the original political formulations of their faiths, such as Moses Mendelssohn, and ' Ali ' Abd al-Râziq who published a treatise on the subject in Cairo in 1925. Starting out from Judaic and Islamic orthodoxy, they advocated precisely a separation of religious and political issues. The author concludes that, just as Jewish political activism is not a necessary option for orthodox Judaism, the political enforcement of Islamic Law is not one for Islam either. Undoubtedly with religiously motivated forms of both Muslim and Jewish intolerance in the present-day Middle-East in mind, Ivry, of all the contributors to the book, has probably the most pertinent message for both religious and political leaders, in the interest of mutual tolerance.1 Two contributions, finally, are devoted to the attitude of Maimonides towards Muslims and Islam: his perception, his image formation, his evaluation and final judgement, on the level both of abstract thought and of concrete legal practice. The late George F. Hourani first analyzes Maimonides' Epistle to Yemen, meant to encourage Yemeni Jews under pressure from Muslims to convert. In enumerating the enemies of the Law, Maimonides alludes to "a Madman" who aimed at power and domination and</page><page sequence="11">Reviews 144 invented his well-known religion. The Yemeni Jews aje advised to keep the Covenant of Moses by observing all commandments and emigrating, if they can, from the land of an oppressor to a country where they can practice their religion (as he had done himself)- The letter closes with a refutation of Muslim efforts to read in certain texts of the Hebrew Bible the announcement of a prophet named Ahmad (in fact Muhammad). Next, the Guide For The Perplexed is analyzed for its references to Islamic religion, scholastic theology, and philosophy. Summarizing what Maimonides says about Islamic prophecy and Law, Hourani quotes him as mentioning three different opinions of believers (in general) on the qualifications and selection of prophets. Some hold that any man whatever may be called to prophethood (as in Islam where the idea of an illiterate prophet is acceptable); others stress the need for perfection of intellect and imagination for prophethood (as the philosophers do); a third opinion agrees but adds that a supplementary act of God's will is required for true prophethood (as in Judaism and according to Maimonides himself). Maimonides attacks the Islamic claim that Muhammad had a genuine prophecy; not only did he not have the moral character required for this, but as a lawgiver he also partially adopted the laws of another religion and consequently must be accused of plagiarism. Of all Laws given to humanity Maimonides asserts the superiority of the Law given to Moses: it takes a middle position between excess in worship, which leads to asceticism (as in Christianity) and indulgence to human appetites, which leads to polygamy (as in Islam). Given these preferences, Maimonides nevertheless acknowledges what is common to all three prophetic religions: the affirmation of the temporal creation of the world (which cannot be proved by rational speculation but only known by prophecy), and this entails the validity of miracles and "other things of that kind." We leave aside here Maimonides' severe criticism of kalcim for its invalid method of reasoning, and his praise of Muslim philosophers, including his near contemporary lbn Rushd; Hourani deals extensively with it. David Novak analyzes the treatment of Islam and Muslims in the legal writings of Maimonides. He starts out with an introduction to the</page><page sequence="12">145 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 2/1 (1990) treatment of other religions in Jewish thought, a subject on which he has published a book, which, unfortunately, we were not able to consult.4 Biblical Judaism considered only the people of Israel to be monotheistic; all other nations were held to be polytheistic and were judged according to political and moral criteria. Rabbinic Judaism developed the doctrine of the "Seven commandments of the children of Noah" by the end of the second century C.E., which implied a universal ban on idolatry and polytheism. Now a distinction was made between polytheistic and monotheistic Gentiles, now judged on the basis of theological criteria. In the centuries immediately following, the notion of a community of Gentile monotheists, distinct from the Jewish people, was still unthinkable. At most, individual Gentile monotheists were recognized and they were in fact perceived as potential Jews. After the rise of Islam and its establishment of a monotheistic community outside Judaism, two views were developed. According to the first, more traditional view, monotheistic Gentiles would eventually be absorbed into Judaism as they came to observe more and more of the commandments; thus Gentile monotheists including Muslims were potential Jews. According to a second view, Gentiles are simply expected to obey the seven commandments of Noah and no more. Gentile monotheists have their own religious and political life which is sufficient for them, and need no particular attachment to Judaism and the Jewish people. Maimonides «acknowledged that Muhammad intended to found a new religion, and considered its most important consequence to be its monotheism, which he acknowledges as adequate, and allows, for instance, the social contacts of Jews with Muslims. Maimonides takes the older of the two views mentioned above, that Gentile monotheism is in fact potential Judaism and that Muslims as well as Christians should in the end convert to Judaism. Mosaic prophecy expresses "original" monotheism, to which other monotheists should return as their source; moreover, compared to other "revealed" legislation, the Torah creates the best social order. Maimonides recognizes the Islamic practice of circumcision as valid, even mandatory, ascribing its origin to Judaism. He regards the monotheism of Islam "as having totally permeated the belief and most of the practices of the Arabs, who are</page><page sequence="13">Reviews 146 related to the Jewish people by literal Abrahamic descent" (242), even if some practical consequence of this view went against current Talmudic tradition. Maimonides hopes for a Messiah-king to put the complete Torah into full practice. "He seemed convinced that if the Jews had the necessary political power, monotheism would become the pervasive practical force that it is now in belief the world over" (240). Novak concludes by comparing Maimonides' attitudes to Islam and Christianity in his legal writings. Even though the Christians accept the Hebrew Bible as divine revelation (something the Muslims do not), they do not apply a correct (monotheistic) exegesis and adhere to doctrines which are untenable since they are in effect polytheistic and philosophically incorrect. Maimonides thus considers Islam as closest to Judaism because of its strict monotheism, although Judaism is superior to it. He views both Christians and Muslims as simply paving the way for the coming of the Messiah-king whom he regards as a political ruler. The Messiah is to restore Jewish political sovereignty, establish the hegemony of the Torah in the world, and make monotheism triumph in human history. The Jews should enforce acceptance of the Commandments of Noah when they have the power to do so, although conversion of Christians and Muslims cannot be enforced, but at most encouraged and facilitated. Maimonides clearly fully belongs to the medieval world. Similar studies of the outlook of other JCM thinkers on religions other than their own, without restricting oneself to the medieval period, should be a priority in any program of research and teaching on Muslim-Judaic Christian relationships. The appearance of a book like this is timely and should be welcomed. It may stimulate further studies in the difficult field (Brinner speaks of "minefields of suspicion, misunderstanding, and hubris on both sides" [ix]) of the history of Judaic-Muslim communal and individual relations. Such studies should envisage, beyond the particularities of both communities, their participation in what has been a common history, with common socio-economic structures and forms of everyday life. It has become clearer, perhaps, than it was a century ago, that both communities, apart from the compensation sought for humiliations suffered and loss of political leadership, not only had in the</page><page sequence="14">147 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 2/1 (1990) medieval period but still entertain today certain totalitarian pretensions as to their prophetic basis, law, and religious tradition, jealously guarded by their assigned religious leadership and institutions. In any case such studies should not remain restricted to the medieval period but be extended to the modern period as well. A field like this needs to be studied not only by cultural historians but also by historians of religion, able to see both religions in a comparative perspective, specialists in economic and social history, and social scientists of various sorts, including anthropologists. For the modern period special attention ought to be paid to the social and economic background from which Jewish and Muslim ideological and religious movements have arisen, and the various forces which have conditioned relations between Jewish and Muslim communities. The most important factor has been the influence of Europe and North America on the world in which Jews and Muslims live and, consequently, on their mutual relations: not only in a direct way but also through ideologies of Western origin which have evoked ideological and religious responses drawing on the religious traditions of both communities. Most studies in the field of Judaic-Islamic and Jewish-Arab relations have concentrated until now on tracing historical sources (Judaic sources for certain elements of Islam;5 Greek sources for elemènts of both Muslim and Jewish medieval thought6), linguistic and literary relations1 (not restricted to literary works),* and the history of Jewish communities in Muslim territory'' (including Islamic legal and political structures conditioning these communities), highlighting the survival and continuity of Jewish identity. Some general introductions to the subject have been written by scholars of standing.10 In the field of religion, however, few new approaches have been tried out. Neither the solutions evolved in Muslims and Jewish communities for the same or similar problems, nor the ramifications of thought within the two communities and the various interpretations given of tradition and particular elements of it have been studied in a comparative perspective. Religious authorities in both religions, their relations to political power, and the impact of different kinds of religious leadership have not been studied by scholars of religion, but</page><page sequence="15">Reviews 148 rather by political scientists. Comparisons between Muslim and Jewish integrist movements and fundamentalist trends have hardly been made. On the whole, the religious aspects of individuals and social life have not yet been given the attention they deserve—perhaps because these aspects are not known to most researchers, or because research in this area would show how much these religions (like others) have been compromised and used to legitimate other things? One final remark may be in place. It would be of great advantage for the study of Judaic-Islamic relations if Judaic-Christian and Islamic Christian relations were also taken into account, either in their own right or for comparative purposes. Although the three parties involved undoubtedly have separate identities, this field of research is essentially concerned with one common history, which still has to be written and the various determinants of which still have to be identified. This book is an excellent starting point. Jacques Waardenburg Département D'Histoire et des Sciences des Religions Université de Lausanne NOTES 1.
