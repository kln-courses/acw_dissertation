<plain_text><page sequence="1">Three Drawings in an Anglo-Saxon Pontifical: Anthropomorphic Trinity or Threefold Christ? Jane E. Rosenthal An exceptional interest in the Trinity in Anglo-Saxon England generated a remarkable variety of images of the tripartite deity that was unparalleled in Continental art of the time.1 Among the diverse and often unusual represen- tations is an anthropomorphic type, virtually unknown in Western art before the twelfth century but common thereafter, in which the divine Persons are portrayed as three similar male figures either seated or standing side by side.2 In this type, the similar human form of the three Persons suggests their consubstantiality, their uniform The thesis of this paper was presented in preliminary form at the Second St. Louis Conference on Manuscript Studies, October, 1975. The present elaboration owes a great deal to the criticism and encouragement of Dr. Florentine Mutherich to whom I am deeply grateful. 1 Wormald, 1963, 20-23. In calling attention to these images, Wormald relates the pictorial development to the growing popularity in England of a private devotional exercise known as the Cursus de Sancta Trinitate. Representations include, in addition to those mentioned by Wormald, (1) a second and different portrayal in the Bury St. Edmunds Psalter, Rome. Vat. Lib.

The first of these unquestionably depicts the triune godhead, but the three figures in the second have been, I believe, incorrectly construed. The following analysis will show that the evidence supports a christological rather than a trinitarian interpretation of the Sherborne images. The characteristic features of the anthropomorphic type are illustrated by the Trinity in the Grimbald Gospels (Fig. 3).4 Here the three figures of the deity, which occupy the top roundels of the frame enclosing the portrait of Saint John, are identical in form, gesture, attributes, and setting. Each sits within a mandorla on a partially visible heavenly sphere, holding an open book in his left hand and gestur- ing with his right.5 The only distinguishing detail among the three is the cross in the halo of the second Person. The figures appear side by side in a horizontal grouping, although they are spaced farther apart than is usual because of their location in the separate roundels of the frame. This Trinity was created through the repetition of the motif of Christ enthroned on a globe, but with the cross removed from the haloes of the first and third Per- sons.6 It is at present the earliest known Western depiction of the anthropomorphic type with the three figures seated.7 The representation in the Sherborne Pontifical consists of three full-page drawings in black ink outline, each reproducing with minor variations the same standing cross-nimbed figure (Figs. 1, 2, 4).8 The drawings appear on consecutive folios at the head of the manuscript in place of a single frontispiece. The impressive size of the figures, which are 20.5 to 22 centimeters high, as well as their number and close resemblance explain why, on cur- sory examination, they could be mistaken for a portrayal of the Trinity. J. O. Westwood first identified them as such without further explanation in 1868.9 The interpreta- tion was universally accepted, and Kiinstle declared the drawings to be the oldest rendering of the anthropo- morphic type.10 Other scholars have more cautiously alleged only the probability of this interpretation,11 while Leroquais even observed that the Trinity thus constituted was indeed "curious" but failed to indicate what made it so.12 In only one instance were the drawings said to repre- sent another subject. Talbot Rice stated, without comment or reference to the Trinitarian interpretation, that the three figures portray "Christ in different aspects."13 This re- mark has been ignored in the subsequent literature which continues to refer to the figures as the three divine Persons. The only support offered so far for the trinitarian inter- pretation of the Sherborne drawings consists of finding parallels for the Sherborne figures in two images thought to depict anthropomorphic Trinities. Neither of the two actually portrays the triune deity, however. One of the im- ages is mentioned by Wormald, and shows three standing male figures which he took for the divine Persons but which in fact represent Apostles. The group is one of four representing the twelve Apostles in a Last Judgment sequence distributed over the canon tables of an Anglo- Saxon gospel book in Pembroke College Library.14 Since the figures are rather similar in appearance and one carries the long cross-staff as a standard-bearer for Christ, 3 An inscription accompanying the image of the anthropomorphic Trinity in the 12th-century Hortus Deliciarum states explicitly that the representation of God as the same figure repeated three times demonstrates God is three in Persons but one in substance. "Trinus et unus deus, trinus in personis, unus in substantia, hoc una facies trium personarum demonstrat." See R.

Kessler, The Illustrated Bibles from Tours, Princeton, 1977, 39-40. 7 Two Early Christian sarcophagi, the "dogmatic" in the Lateran and a recent discovery in Arles, contain images which may possibly represent the Trinitas creator mundi, but they differ from the type by showing one figure seated, the other two standing.

Heimann proposed the Trinitarian interpretation of the three bearded male figures on the Lateran sarcophagus in "Trinitas Creator Mundi," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 11, 1938, 42-44. The interpretation has recently been rejected for both the Lateran and Arles sarcophagi by J. Engemann, "Zu den Dreifaltigkeitsdarstellungen der friihchristlichen Kunst: Gab es im 4.

The second parallel is cited by Temple.15 It is a late Carolingian drawing added to a ninth-century manuscript from Lorsch in the Vatican Library.16 The drawing represents three plain-haloed, standing, male figures which have on occasion been called a Trinity but are currently thought to represent anonymous male saints. No specific trinitarian details are included in the depiction, and the presence of the scroll in the right hand of two of the men is inconsistent with a trinitarian interpretation since the attribute is traditionally shown in the left hand of the deity. Also the inscription accompanying the drawing makes no reference to the deity in any form.7 The facing page, however, contains another late Carolingian addition in the form of a prayer addressed to the Trinity. Some scholars, believing the two additions were joint entries, assumed the drawing represented the three Persons invoked in the prayer.18 Others, questioning the contemporaneousness of image and text, have left the interpretation open.19 Recently Bischoff determined from the palaeographic evidence that the inscription above the drawing and the prayer were written at different times by different hands. He therefore concluded that the two additions were unrelated and dis- missed the trinitarian interpretation as groundless.20 Aside from these attempts to find parallel trinitarian representations, no effort has been made to test the validity of this interpretation of the Sherborne figures. No study has been undertaken of the pictorial types or iconographic details incorporated in the drawings, nor has the context in which the images appear been investigated. I will examine these critical issues and argue from the results that the Sherborne figures represent, not a "curious" Trinity, but "Christ in different aspects." The three figures in the Sherborne Pontifical are arranged with the first two standing opposite one another (fols. 5v-6r; Figs. 1, 2) and the third appearing on the verso of the second (fol. 6v; Fig. 4). All three have the same tall, slender, upright body turned in three-quarter view to the right. They wear identical garments and hold the book and a second attribute in similar fashion. They differ in detail, however. The first figure is an august, regal personage, fully bearded, who wears a jeweled lily- crown and carries a cross-staff diagonally against one shoulder. He holds a book with two crosses on its cover, and his tunic has a decorated neckline. The second figure, with a short-cropped beard, is equally imposing but not crowned. His tunic is similarly decorated at the neck, and he bears the same attributes as the first, but holds the staff with its simpler cross-head upright at his side. The third figure is a young man, clean-shaven except for a bit of stubble along the jaw line, who carries a palm branch in- stead of a staff in his right hand. His book, like his tunic, is unembellished and a strip of earth from which small plants sprout lies beneath his feet. In addition, the frame, which is left empty in the other drawings, is here filled with an acanthus frieze. It should also be noted that the size of the figures diminishes as the series progresses. The first is the tallest, with one foot extending beyond the outer boundary of the frame, the second breaks into the frame, but the third is completely contained within it, not even touching the inner border at top or bottom. Several aspects of the drawings just described clearly contradict the fundamental notions of co-equality and in- divisibility essential to renderings of the Trinity. For one, the variation in the scale of the figures is significant, since the first two Persons in an anthropomorphic Trinity would not be portrayed as they are in the Sherborne draw- ings, larger and hence greater than the third, nor would they be shown breaking boundaries within which he is completely confined. Equally revealing is the distribution of the Sherborne figures over three consecutive pages which makes it impossible to see all three together. As a result the idea of the union of the three Persons in one godhead, expressed in anthropomorphic Trinities through the grouping of the figures side by side in the same image, is obviously lacking in the Sherborne rendering. There the three can never be one. In addition, the Sherborne figures, each of which turns to the right, constitute an open-ended series in which the eye is led from left to right from one image to the next until it passes finally to the page of text facing the last figure (fols. 6v-7r). The principle underly- ing the arrangement of the Sherborne drawings is therefore continuous lateral movement rather than the closed, static bisymmetry of the anthropomorphic Trinities. A further element of the drawings not found in Trinities is the difference in settings given to the three figures. The first two are left against the blank vellum without any indication of place, while the third is shown walking on rolling ground. The figures therefore exist in two different realms - abstract, undefined space on the one hand and concrete, physical reality on the other. Unique and unaccountable as such a distinction would be in an image of the Trinity, it is made even more implausi- ble here by the fact that, if the figures represent the divine Persons, it is the Holy Spirit and not the Incarnate Son who is shown treading the earth. The principal key to the true meaning of these images is found in the attributes borne by the figures. The most 15 Temple, 17, 30, n. 5, 60, fig. 31. 16 Rome, Vat. Lib. MS Pal. lat. 834, fol. 28v.

Paris, Bibl. Nat. MS lat. 943, fol. 6v (photo: Bibliotheque Nationale) significant of these is the long cross-staff held by the first two figures who are thus identified as representations of Christus victor, the cross-staff being the essential compo- nent of this well-known type. The iconography is Early Christian in origin and was adapted from a form of Roman Imperial portraiture in which the emperor, shown in military dress either standing or walking, appears as semper et ubique victor holding a spear, standard, or trophaeum as a symbol of his invincible might (Figs. 5A- B).21 The triumphant Christ, sometimes in military garb but more frequently dressed in tunic and pallium, bears the cross-staff in place of the pagan attributes as a symbol of the victory over sin and death that he achieved on the Cross (Figs. 6, 8). The staff, like its Imperial counter- parts, is either held upright beside the body, usually with one end planted on the ground (Figs. 2, 5A, 6), or is carried diagonally against or across one shoulder (Figs. 1, 5B, 13).22 It generally appears in Christ's right hand, leaving the left to hold the traditional scroll or book (Figs. 1, 6). This triumphant figure type, whether emperor or Christ, was used alone as an isolated image to portray the vic- torious ruler or was inserted as the central motif in ap- propriate symbolic or narrative compositions.23 Numerous Carolingian and Ottonian representations of the type in diverse contexts testify to its currency on the Continent in the early Middle Ages,24 and examples in British art are found from the second half of the eighth century on.25 Both versions of the Christus victor motif with upright and diagonal staff are represented in the Sherborne draw- ings (Figs. 1, 2). The use of these large-scale images of the victorious Christ at the beginning of a book continues an earlier Anglo-Saxon practice first manifested in the tower- ing figure of Christ (21cm high) at the front of Saint Dunstan's classbook (Fig. 7)26 and in the full-page draw- ing of Christus triumphans (27.5cm high) which stands at 21 For the Imperial type, see R.

A.D. 950, the St. John's figure perhaps a decade later.28 The Dunstan drawing appears to reflect in somewhat altered form a model that resembled the first Sherborne figure in pose and gesture except for the turn of the head,29 while the similarities between the St. John's drawing and the second Sherborne figure are so close as to suggest that the later work may have been based directly on the earlier.30 The model of the Dunstan drawing and the figure in the St. John's manuscript thus provide precedents for both ver- sions of the triumphant Christ in the Sherborne series, and the appearance of the two drawings at the head of their respective manuscripts establishes the use of these large single-figure images as frontispieces. The earlier drawings also bear witness to the fact that the two versions of the victorious Christ type circulated independently and were employed singly in a given context. The combination of the two in the Sherborne program therefore represents an unusual expansion of both the theme of Christus victor and the customary use of a single frontispiece. Not only do the first two images of Christ in the Sher- borne drawings differ in the manner of holding the cross- staff but they are further distinguished one from the other by the crown worn by the first (Figs. 1, 2). A recent study concludes that the crown or its ancient equivalent, the jeweled diadem, first appeared on the head of Christ in the last decades of the tenth century, not long before the Sher- borne drawings were executed.31 There is, however, at least one ninth-century representation known in which Christ wears what is probably a pearl diadem.32 The earliest Anglo-Saxon portrayal of the crowned Christ oc- curs in the Benedictional of St. Aethelwold, dated to the 970's, and shows Christ with a diadem consisting of a wide gold band with rectangular divisions designating jewels. 33The motif next appears in the Sherborne drawing where the diadem is replaced by the lily-crown, a Carolingian form of royal insignia adopted by the Anglo- Saxons.34 The presence of a crown or a diadem on the head of the Savior characterizes him as Christus rex, Christ the King, ruler of Heaven and earth.35 The first Sherborne figure thus combines the attributes of Christus victor and Christus rex in order to portray the Savior as the all-conquering king of the universe. The combination occurs in only one other Anglo-Saxon image, the representation of Christ as the rex gloriae of Psalm 23 27 Oxford, St. John's College Ms 28, fol. 2r; Temple, No. 13. The drawing, produced either at Glastonbury or Canterbury, is executed in brownish- purple ink. The homiletic text surrounding the figure was added in the late loth century. See J. J. G. Alexander, Anglo-Saxon Illumination in Oxford Libraries, Oxford, 1970, 7-8. The peculiar tendrils sprouting from the bottom of the cross-staff are drawn in the black ink used for the text and appear to be a flourish added by the scribe at the time of the in- sertion of the homily. 28 Both drawings were assigned to the mid-loth century by Wormald, 1952, Nos. 46, 51. Temple, No. 13, seems to suggest a slightly later date for the St. John's drawing, and Deshman dates it to the 960's while plac- ing the Dunstan drawing in the 950's. See Deshman, 1977, 153-54. 29 Alexander, 174, concludes the Dunstan Christ is based on a full-length figure like the Sherborne drawing but does not mention the triumphant Christ type. The modifications of the type in the Dunstan image include (1) the depiction of Christ emerging from clouds instead of standing full- length, (2) the transformation of the cross-staff into the rod of righteousness as the inscription along its shaft indicates, (3) the addition of text to the book which, according to its shape, was closed in the model as it is in the first Sherborne drawing. For the inscriptions and the inter- pretation of this portrayal of Christ as the Wisdom of God, see M. T. d'Alverny, "Le Symbolisme de la sagesse et le Christ de Saint Dunstan," Bodleian Library Record, v, 1956, 232-244. Another more convincing reading of the image as a representation of Christ, the ruler and instruc- tor of monks, holding the rod as a symbol of his kingship, is found in John Higgitt's article "Glastonbury, Dunstan, Monasticism and Manuscripts," Art History, ii, Pt. 3, 1979, 279-81.

Christian exegesis had identified the rex gloriae of these verses as Christ the almighty conqueror of sin and death, and the gates to which he comes in triumph were usually interpreted as either the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem to which he ascended after his Resurrection or the doors of Hell to which he descended after his death to rescue the souls held captive there. The verses were therefore customarily illustrated with a depiction of the Ascension or the Harrowing of Hell."3 In the Bury and Odbert im- ages, however, a different iconographic tradition was followed, one that is found in one other Anglo-Saxon il- lustration of the psalm, the drawing in Harley manuscript 603 in the British Library (Fig. 11).39 All three depictions continue the literal rendering of the text given earlier in the Utrecht Psalter in which Christ appears in the guise of an all-powerful, victorious ruler (Fig. 13).40 The Harley drawing faithfully reproduces the Utrecht illustration depicting the arrival of the rex gloriae as the adventus of a triumphant emperor before the gates of a city. The cross- nimbus is the only detail identifying this Roman con- queror as Christ the King of Glory. In contrast to these representations, which express Christ's kingship in Roman Imperial terms, the Bury and Odbert renderings (Figs. 9, 10) place a lily-crown on the head of the rex gloriae as a symbol of his royal sovereignty while retaining the spear with victory pennant attached and adding a shield as a further sign of his invincible might. Finally, the king is shown alone and the notion of his coming, con- ceived in the ceremonial terms of the adventus in the Utrecht/Harley drawings, is conveyed through the energetic striding of the Bury figure and remains implicit in the more static posture in the Odbert rendering. These two images of the rex gloriae thus offer parallels for the first Sherborne drawing through their presentation of Christ as a single figure in epiphany, walking or moving to the right, bearing the crown and the spear or cross-staff as the attributes of royalty and supreme power. It has been suggested, in the context of a trinitarian in- 36Rome, Vat. Lib. MS Reg. lat, 12, fol. 37v; Temple, No. 84. The manuscript, which probably originated at Christ Church, Canterbury, dates to the second quarter of the 11th century. 37 Boulogne, Bibl. Mun. MS 20, fol. 29v; J. Porcher, Les Manuscrits a peintures en France du Vlle au Xlle siecle, exh. cat., Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, 1954, No. 111. The psalter was executed by Odbert, Ab- bot of St.-Bertin, and collaborators between 986 and 1007. The seven marginal drawings, if not actually by an Anglo-Saxon artist, were at least based on an Anglo-Saxon archetype which also served for the Regina Psalter. For a detailed study of the relationship of the marginal illustra- tions in the two psalters, see Harris, 101ff. and specifically 103, 115-16, for the two images of the rex gloriae. 38 For the interpretation of the verses, see J. M. Neale and R. F. Littledale, A Commentary on the Psalms, London, 1884, I, 334-36, and the Gospel of Nicodemus in E. Hennecke and W.

The psalter, probably produced at Christ Church, Canterbury, in the first years of the 11th century, is the earliest of the three surviving English copies of the Carolingian psalter in Utrecht, a Reims manuscript dated ca. 820 which is known to have been in England by the end of the 10th century.

When the cross-halo occurs in representations of the Trinity, however, it either belongs to the second Person alone (e.g., Fig. 3) or is retained by him while also being assigned to the other two Persons.42 It could not become the exclusive property of either the Father or the Holy Spirit. For the same reason, it seems highly unlikely that the Father would be shown in possession of the crown of the Son while the Son appeared without it, as would be the case in the so-called Sherborne Trinity. Furthermore, a crowned God the Father at this time would be not only novel but extraordinary.43 Hence the crown, like the cross-staff, identifies the first Sherborne figure as Christ. It may therefore be concluded that all the pictorial evidence here considered suggests that the first two Sherborne drawings represent epiphanies of the victorious Christ who comes first as king, then as an equally impressive figure but not a king. The third drawing (Fig. 4) continues the theme by repeating the same figure of Christ but provides an earthly setting for the epiphany and creates through the unprece- dented change in the key attribute the unusual iconog- raphy of Christ holding a palm frond.44 The palm is made prominent by its being the only detail executed in orange ink in the three drawings.45 The new attribute is of course an appropriate substitute for the cross-staff, since it too was a pagan symbol of victory associated with Imperial triumph. Palm branches figure in the Johannine account of Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (John 12: 12-13) and were adopted by Christians as an insignia of the victorious martyr.46 The palm would thus be a fitting attribute for Christ who was regarded by the early Church as the "king of martyrs" and the "master of martyrdom" whose example was to be imitated piously by those who followed, a notion still being expounded in homilies on the martyrdom of Saint Stephen in Anglo-Saxon England.47 The palm is not mentioned in those texts, however. It is rather in the commentaries on Jesus' entry into Jerusalem that the palm branches carried by the people are explained as symbols of Christ's victorious martyrdom on the Cross. To quote Saint Augustine, the palms were "praises, signi- fying victory, because the Lord by dying was to overcome death, and with the trophy of the cross was to triumph over the devil, the prince of death."48 The palm frond in the hand of the third figure of Christ therefore refers to the initial conquest of death achieved through the martyr- dom on the Cross, while the cross-staff borne by the other two figures of Christ symbolizes the triumphs realized as a result of the victory on the Cross. Since Christ suffered death in his human nature, the substitution of the palm for the cross-staff in the third figure gives special em- phasis to the humanity of Christ within the traditional iconography of his appearing in triumph. The physical world in which this victory was achieved is represented by the strip of ground beneath Christ's feet and the foliate motifs in the frame, while the humble state to which he descended in becoming man is expressed through the re- duced size of the figure, its confinement within the frame, and the unadorned simplicity of the garments. Although textual sources can be found relating the palm 41 Deshman, 1976, 373. The explanation is made in relation to an Otto- nian miniature but is applied to the Sherborne figure in n. 33. 42 E.g., Heimann (as in n. 7), pl. 8c. 43 Deshman, 1976, 373. The Ottonian image cited as a possible first ex- ample of this iconography probably represents, not God the Father, but the Verbum dei. 44 The attribute has never been properly identified and in fact is named only three times in the literature: Westwood (as in n. 9), 129, refers to it as either a "long red feather" or a bit of "herbage"; Leroquais, i, cxlix, remarked that it looked like a "long bird's feather"; and Temple, 60, calls it a virga without further explanation. The object certainly represents a palm frond with the individual pinnae indicated in the conventional manner by small diagonal strokes placed at regular intervals on either side of the long stem. For other Anglo-Saxon examples where the curv- ing frond is held in a similar fashion against the shoulder, see the two saints at the head of the blessed being led to Heaven in a drawing from the New Minster Register, Temple, pl. 247, and a group of martyrs receiving crowns in Harley 603, fol. 3r, Temple, No. 64. Carolingian parallels are found, for example, in the Utrecht Psalter, Dufrenne, 1979, pls. 40, figs. 10, 17; 42, figs. 1, 3, 9, 12, 13, and in a miniature depicting saints in Heaven in the Metz Sacramentary, F. Miitherich, Sakramentar von Metz: MS lat. 1141, Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris (Codices Selecti, xxvIII), Graz, 1972, fol. 5v. 45 The orange ink is original.

Leclerq, "Palme," Dictionnaire d'archeologie chritienne et de liturgie, xmi/1, cols. 947ff. Several representations of martyrs with palm fronds are listed in n. 44. 47 The first designation appears in a letter from the church of Lyon dated A.D. 177. See Cabrol and Leclerq (as in n. 46), 948.

It appears in the illustration to Psalm 97 in the Utrecht Psalter (Fig. 12) and hence could have been known to the Sherborne artist.49 The drawing shows Christ in Heaven walking towards the enthroned deity who hands him a palm branch. The two figures evidently have no counterpart in the illustration of the text in other psalters.s0 This ambulatory Christ receiving the palm 49Utrecht, Rijksuniversiteit Bibliotheek Ms 32, fol. 56v.

Thus the palm is awarded here to Christ the conqueror.51 But the frond could also be understood in this context as an allusion to his triumphant martyrdom since certain commentators like Jerome inter- preted the great victory won through the power of the Lord's right arm and hand as the redemption of man achieved through Christ's death on the Cross.52 The palm is associated with Christ's martyrdom in one other Anglo- Saxon representation, a drawing in the Arenberg Gospels, but in this image it is the lamb, not Christ, who appears, and an angel stands behind the sacrificial victim holding a palm branch over its back.53 It is evident from the preceding examination of the at- tributes and details of form in the Sherborne drawings that the three figures represent Christus victor who comes in three aspects. Two of these aspects have been identified, the first and last, Christ as king and man, while the precise nature of the second remains undetermined. So too does the broader significance of this remarkable, unprecedent- ed triple portrait of the triumphant Savior. Answers to the question of the specific meaning of both the second image and the group are found in the context of the first Advent, in the notions of Christ expounded in the traditional interpretation of the gifts of the Magi. From Irenaeus on, the Fathers saw in the gold, frankin- cense, and myrrh presented to the Child symbols of the threefold character of Christ: the gold, the attribute of terrestial monarchs, testified that he was king; the in- cense burned in the divine service, that he was god; and the myrrh, used to preserve the bodies of the deceased from decay, that he was man.54 The Sherborne drawings portray Christ in precisely the aspects described in this ex- egesis of the gifts and in the same order. The second figure can thus be seen to depict Christ as god. The majestic ap- pearance and solemn dignity of the figure fit this inter- pretation, as do the attributes of cross-staff and book, the absence of a concrete setting, and the fact that Christ is portrayed here, as he is in the first image, bearded and mature in contrast to the clean-shaven youthfulness of the figure of Christ as man.55 A further direct link between the symbolism of the gifts and the imagery seems to exist in the third drawing where the function of myrrh and its association with death may have contributed to the deci- sion to depict the man Christ as a victorious martyr. Since the theme of Christ's coming in his threefold character had apparently no pictorial precedents, the Sher- borne master had to devise his own program of illustra- tion.56 He found a suitable formula by selecting a well- known, readily recognizable type of Christ and repeating it with some variation in detail in three separate but con- secutive images constituting a single group. The similar bodily form and posture of the figures serve to indicate that it is the same person in the same act that we see each time, while the changes in costume, attributes, and setting characterize the different aspects in which Christ appears simultaneously. The three figures thus combine to produce a complete portrait of the threefold Christ who is king, god, and man. Pictorial improvisations of this sort were not uncommon in Anglo-Saxon art, for artists of the period often created representations for subjects not previously illustrated or devised new iconographic for- mulae for traditional themes.57 What prompted the un- usual choice of the threefold Christ as the subject for depiction in the Sherborne drawings is our next concern. For an answer we turn to the manuscript in which the im- ages occur. A pontifical is used by a bishop in the liturgical 51 See Dufrenne, 1979, 106, where parallels in Imperial imagery are cited. The scales in the left hand of the victorious Savior identify him as the "justice" of the Lord (verse 2). 52 S. Hieronymi Presbyteri Opera. Pars II Opera Homiletica, ed. E.

Irenaeus's commentary is found in his Adversus Omnes Haereses I1I. 9; Sources chretiennes, xxxiv, 156.

For further commentary on the gifts, see G. Vezin, L'Adoration et le cycle des mages dans l'art chretien primitif, Paris, 1950, 32ff. 55 The juxtaposition of images of the bearded and unbearded Christ recalls certain Early Christian monuments like the 4th-century sar- cophagus in S. Ambrogio, Milan, or the 6th-century apse mosaics from the Ravennate church of S. Michele in which a similar combination of the two types of Christ occurs. These early works differ fundamentally from the Sherborne images in other respects, however, since they repre- sent Christ twice only and portray him in two different postures, one seated, the other standing. For the sarcophagus, see G. Bovini, I sarcofagi paleocristiani, Vatican City, 1949, 232, figs. 249-250, and A. Katz- enellenbogen, "The Sarcophagus in S.

Deichmann, Ravenna: Hauptstadt des Spiitantiken abendlandes, Wiesbaden, I, 1969, 221-25, pls. 211-16; II, 1976, 38-43. 56 Christ is shown in different aspects in a unique illustration of the Vi- sion of the Magi in the Cappadocian church of Egri Tas. The representa- tion is unrelated to the Sherborne imagery, however, although both ul- timately have their origins in the symbolism of the gifts. In the fresco, dated to the 8th or 9th century, Christ is depicted in each of three suc- cessive scenes receiving a gift from one of the Magi. In the first two he appears bearded, mature, enthroned, with his hand raised in blessing; in the last he is represented as the Child in the crib. See N. and M.

These in- clude the service for the dedication of a church, the or- dination of the various degrees of clergy, and the blessing of abbots and abbesses.58 The pontifical had developed in the ninth and tenth centuries in response to the need to bring together in a single volume both the instructions for the performance of these episcopal rites which were found previously in the ordinal and the texts used in the rites which were contained in the sacramentary.59 The choice of materials included in the early pontificals varied widely from place to place, as did the order of presentation. One feature of the Sherborne manuscript that should be noted, because of its particular significance for the drawings, is the location of the ordo for the dedication of the church at the beginning of the book before all the other texts. The ordo also appears in this position in several other Anglo- Saxon pontificals related to the Sherborne.60 Early pontificals were rarely illustrated and then only in isolated instances, so far as can be judged from the manuscripts listed in published studies.61 The ninth- century pontificals known at present have no original im- agery and only three from the tenth and the first half of the eleventh centuries, in addition to the Sherborne, con- tain illustrations. Although other early pontificals may be uncovered,62 the fraction of the total with pictorial representations is not likely to change with new finds. Our few examples may therefore be taken as an essentially ac- curate reflection of the rarity and sporadic nature of pic- torial illustration in these early manuscripts, while the representations themselves show the relatively limited and improvisational character of the imagery devised on those rare occasions when illustrations were introduced, there being evidently no established program to be followed. A brief examination of the illustrations in the other three manuscripts will help to place the Sherborne figures. The imagery in one of the three, the Ottonian pontifical in Bamberg dated 1012-14, consists of a traditional type of manuscript illumination, the donor portrait. 63 The type is adapted to the new context, however, since the donor, Em- peror Henry II, is shown with his arms supported by two bishops in the position assumed during a ceremonial en- trance into the church.64 This is the only painted miniature in any of these early pontificals. The other two manuscripts, the eleventh-century Lanalet Pontifical from Wessex and a Beneventan rotulus dated between 957 and 969,65 are illustrated, like the Sherborne, with outline drawings all of which appear to be new inventions devised to illustrate the text. The series of twelve drawings in the Beneventan roll, which are clearly experimental im- provisations, portray specific scenes in the ordination of the clergy and are inserted unframed at appropriate inter- vals in the text.66 The two illustrations in the Lanalet Pon- tifical also depict ritual enactments, but from other ceremonies, namely, the dedication of a church and probably the episcopal benediction. These drawings also seem to have no precedent, but, unlike the Beneventan sketches, they are represented in full-page images on single leaves at the head of the volume. The first drawing (fol. Iv) may not be in its original position in the manuscript, however, for it portrays a bishop in a chasu- ble with a maniple in his left hand and his arms raised in prayer, officiating from a pontifical held open before him by a priest.67 The subject would make a suitable fron- tispiece for the benedictional portion of the manuscript (fols. 96r-160r). The second drawing (fol. 2v; Fig. 14) represents a scene from the ceremony of the dedication of 58 On the nature of the pontifical, see Leroquais, i, i-cxxix.

Vogel, Introduction aux sources de l'histoire du culte chretien au moyen age, Spoleto, 1966, 183ff. 60 These include the Anderson-Brodie pontifical (London, Brit. Lib. MS Add. 57337, fols.

He is followed by a procession of priests and monks. A group of laymen appear below, along with two tubs, one perhaps containing water to be blessed and used in the purification of the church. This drawing quite appropriately serves as a frontispiece to the church dedica- tion ordo, which is the first text in the manuscript.68 The Sherborne Pontifical, like the Lanalet, has full-page images at the beginning of the manuscript which illus- trate the dedication ordo, as the following analysis will show.69 But the subject matter in the Sherborne drawings differs from that in the Lanalet since the former are con- cerned with portraying the content and symbolism of the rite while the latter depicts its external enactment. The preeminent position of the dedication ordo and its illustration in these two Anglo-Saxon pontificals reflect the importance of this service, the most elaborate and im- pressive of all those reserved for bishops and one which had a particular significance in Anglo-Saxon England dur- ing the monastic reform movement when many churches were constructed or rebuilt. The ceremony was carried out with great pomp and large numbers attended, including other bishops and prelates, the king himself on occasion, lords, local officials, and the people.70 The long and complex service began the night before with a vigil over the relics to be deposited in the altar the next day."7 At dawn the following morning the bishop with the clergy and people gathered outside the main doorway to the empty church. Twelve candles were lit and placed around the church, and then the clergy, led by the bishop, and the people moved in solemn procession three times around the church chanting the litany. The proces- sion stopped before the portal once again, and after a deacon had slipped into the church and stationed himself behind the closed door, the bishop approached and knocked three times for admission. A brief dialogue en- sued between the bishop and deacon following which the door was thrown open and the bishop entered. He and the clergy proceeded down the church to the foot of the altar and prostrated themselves on mats while the second litany -C - osRouen, Bibl. Mun. A. 27, fol. 2v (photo: Courtauld Institute of Art) was chanted. The bishop then rose and with his staff wrote two alphabets on the floor in the form of a cross. This act marked the end of the first portion of the ceremony known as the Entrance. It was succeeded by the many rites of purification and consecration of the various parts of the building and the altar, the blessing of the liturgical implements and vestments, the deposit of the relics, and finally by a special Mass. The Sherborne imagery appears to be related to the first part of the ceremony, the dramatic entrance, in which the 68 See J. Gage, "The Anglo-Saxon Ceremonial of the Dedication and Consecration of Churches," Archaeologia, xxv, 1884, 245. There are ap- parently no earlier or contemporary renderings of this subject. Leroquais, i, cxxix-cxxx, ignorant of the Beneventan roll and regarding the Lanalet drawings as an aberration, concluded that this type of pontifical illustra- tion is characteristic only of 13th-century manuscripts. He also believed that the few illustrations in earlier pontificals such as the Sherborne were all borrowed from the missal or the sacramentary, the imagery traveling to the pontifical along with the text. This cannot be true, however, for the Sherborne figures which have no parallels in sacramentaries or elsewhere. 69 Between the drawings which end on fol. 6v and the ordo beginning on fol. 10 are a copy of a papal letter bestowing the pall on Saint Dunstan (fols. 7r-8v) and a table of contents (fols. 9r-10r), both written by the scribe of the rest of the manuscript. 70 For a description of the enactment of the ceremony and references to contemporary sources recounting actual dedications, see Gage (as in n. 68), 235-250. 71 The following outline of the rite and the analysis of some of the texts employed is based on the version of the ordo found in the Sherborne manuscript and related Anglo-Saxon pontificals. The Sherborne is adhered to in the few details in which it deviates from the others. The text of the Sherborne ordo was published by E.

The texts used in the enactment of this drama begin with the antiphon chanted by the bishop and clergy when they first assemble before the closed doors of the church (fol. 10r). This antiphon, which employs Jesus' own words to indicate that he is coming, quotes his com- mand to the publican Zachaeus to hasten and prepare his home for Jesus' arrival and concludes with his observation upon entering that "salvation has come into this house to- day." 73The next antiphon (fol. 10r), sung while the twelve candles symbolizing the twelve Apostles are lit and placed three on each side of the church, is the first of a number of references in the ordo to the church as the heavenly Jerusalem. The anthem paraphrases Apocalypse 21: 13, which describes the gates of the heavenly city as being three each on the east, north, south, and west of the city.74 The long litany (fols. 10v-llv), beginning with the traditional triple invocation of Christ, is then recited dur- ing the three circuits of the church. It is followed, upon the arrival of the procession once more before the closed doors, by the dialogue based on the last verse of Psalm 23 heralding the advent of the rex gloriae at the "eternal gates" (fols. 11v-12r). Again the structure is threefold. The bishop, having knocked three times on the door with his cambutta, recites the command in verse 7: "Lift up your gates, O ye princes and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates: and the King of Glory shall enter in." The deacon replies with the question asked at the beginning of verse 8: "Who is this King of Glory?" The dialogue is repeated two more times with the third and final question being answered by the whole assembly quoting the concluding sentence of the psalm: "The Lord of hosts He is the King of Glory." The bishop knocks once more and the door is immediately opened. The scuolo then chants the whole psalm with antiphons before the open door, after which the bishop with the clergy and people enters the church. Finally, at the end of the entrance ceremony the short litany recited at the altar (fols. 12v-13v) addresses Christ first as pious king, next as the Son of God, once more as pious king, and last as agnus dei.75 He is therefore invoked in each of his three aspects as king, god, and - through the symbolic form of the lamb - as man. Of these texts two seem to have been most influential in determining the subject matter of the Sherborne drawings, the rex gloriae dialogue and the short litany. The first in- troduces the notion of Christ coming in triumph as a mighty king, which led here, as in the illustration of Psalm 23 in the Bury Psalter, to the choice of the Christus victor type and the representation of Christ crowned in the first image. It also probably contributed through its threefold evocation of the triumphant ruler to the idea of portraying the victorious Christ three times. Further prompting in this direction may have come from the triple invocation of Christ at the beginning of the long litany. This threefold pattern of reference to Christ's advent may alone have suggested to the Sherborne artist the notion of representing Christ in his three aspects. But the notion was surely reinforced if not actually compelled by the forms of address in the short litany. The Sherborne figures are therefore understandable as illustrations of the basic theme of the entrance ceremony, the arrival of the victorious Christ who comes as the king of glory, God almighty, and man the martyr to occupy his temple.76 The three figures of Christ are preceded in the pontifical by a full-page drawing of the Crucifixion (Fig. 15). It ap- pears on folio 4v facing an empty page (fol. 5r) which separates it from the figures (fols. 5v-6v). The blank folio is not ruled for text and contains no other evidence that it was originally intended for some purpose that was not fulfilled. Apparently it was deliberately left blank. As such it serves a critical pictorial function, because by setting the Crucifixion apart from the figures it makes clear that the latter are to be read as a single, triadic group rather than as three separate entities in a series.77 The Crucifixion, rendered in black ink outline with a good deal of orange included, gives the appearance of be- ing part of the original program of illustration and could be accepted as such without question if it were not for two 72 For an explanation of the bishop's impersonation of Christ in the en- trance ceremony, see the Tractatus de Dedicatione Ecclesiae, attributed on tenuous grounds to Remigius of Auxerre, Pat. lat., cxxxi, 847C-848D. On the question of attribution, see R. Quadri, "Un frammento Milanese del 'Tractatus de dedicatione templi' attribuito a Remigio di Auxerre," Italia Medioevale e Umanistica, viII, 1965, 316-17. The text is regularly included in Romano-Germanic pontificals. See Vogel and Elze (as in n. 61), I, 90-121. 73 "Zacheae festinans descende quia hodie in domo tua oportet me manere at ille festinans descendit et suscepit illum gaudens in domo sua hodie huic domui salus a dfio facta est." Based on Luke 19: 5-9. 74 "Ab oriente portae tres, ab occidente portae tres, ab aquilone portae tres, et ab austro portae tres." The antiphon does not occur at this point in the ordo in related Anglo-Saxon pontificals, but it is used much later in the ceremony during the placing of twelve tapers inside the church in the Benedictional/Pontifical of Archbishop Robert. See Wilson, 97. 7s "Miserere nobis pie rex die iesu christe ... / Hic et in perpetuum nos custodire digneris Christe Fili dei vivi miserere nobis ... / Miserere nobis pie rex dffe iesu ... / Agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi miserere nobis..." All the related pontificals have the same litany but none repeats a second time the invocation of "pie rex dife iesu christe." 76 See Neale and Littledale (as in n. 38), 337, who observe in regard to the use of the rex gloriae verses in the dedication ceremony that "the en- trance of the Lord into his new temple" was thought of as "symbolical of His entrance into the 'house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."' 77 The blank space below the scene of the Crucifixion is also not ruled, so does not seem to have been intended for an inscription or title. It may simply be a carry-over of a feature in the model that has no function in the copy. Pontificals did not have titles at this time; they began directly with the rubrics and opening words of the first ordo.

Nat. ms lat. 943, f ol. 4v (photo: Bibliothe'que Nationale) facts. First, the drawing was apparently not executed by the artist responsible for the three figures. A different but closely related hand is evident in the sketchier, drier character of the line, compared with the firm, flowing con- tours in the figures, and in the somewhat different for- mulae used for the rendering of details such as eyes and ears. 78This second artist could certainly have worked at the same time as the first, but it is also possible that his contribution is a later addition. Second, the Crucifixion is located on the last leaf of the first short quire (fols. 1-4v). The remaining contents of this quire consist en- tirely of brief, miscellaneous texts, all of which are later additions entered by diverse hands at different times in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.79 Was the drawing also, like the texts, an addition? This would have to be the case if the quire itself were not an original part of the manu- script. But the leaves of the quire give every evidence of being original, since they are of the same quality of skin as the rest in the book and the pattern of prickings and rulings for the text is identical. Also Anglo-Saxon pontifi- cals customarily had several blank folios included before both the pontifical and benedictional sections, apparently to provide expressly for later insertions.80 So the folios of the first quire evidently belonged to the manuscript from the first, and the last one would therefore have presum- ably been available, though not necessarily used, at the time the initial program of illustration was carried out. The Crucifixion could thus have been part of that program executed by an artist collaborating with the master of the three figures. The close similarity in the styles of the two artists suggests a likelihood of their working together in the same center at the same time. However, the possibility that the Crucifixion was added a short time later by the second artist cannot be ruled out. Whichever may have been the case, the drawing was in- tegrated pictorially and iconographically with the images of Christ. Its dimensions are the same and are fixed by the prickings for the vertical and horizontal text boundaries as they are in the other drawings. It is framed in the same manner and drawn in the same technique. The choice of subject is also appropriate, for it recalls the momentous event by which Christ became the victorious conqueror portrayed in the following images. Even if this drawing is a later addition and the choice of subject was initially prompted by a desire to place a representation of the Crucifixion at the head of a liturgical book, it is evident that the second artist was well aware of the meaning of the figures of Christ and sought to make their relationship to the Crucifixion explicit. A particular correspondence was established between the Crucifixion and the last of the three figures to which it is most intimately linked thematically (Figs. 15, 4). Both images were given an earthly setting in the form of a rolling groundline; both have their frames filled with an acanthus frieze. They are also the only drawings in the series in which orange ink is used. These pictorial correspondences emphasize the iconographic connection between the two images, the first 78 These observations in large part reflect the opinion expressed by F. Avril of the Bibliotheque Nationale who kindly examined the drawings at my request before I had an opportunity to study them myself. The possibility that the drawings were not all by the same hand was first raised in the literature by Alexander in Alexander and Kauffmann, No. 6. 79 For the texts, see N. R.

See Wilson, xi, 1, 31, 60. The Anderson and Lanalet manuscripts, both of which are missing their first leaves, have initially blank folios at the end of the pontifical before the benedictional, fols. 101v-102v and fols. 93r-95v respectively.

The theme could be easily communicated to the 1978. artist or artists and required only three models: one for the Crucifixion, if it is original, and two for the figures, since one version of the Christus victor type apparently Goldschmidt, A., Die deutsche Buchmalerei, Florence, 1928. served for the first and last images while the other version Grabar, A., L'Empereur dans l'art byzantin, London, 1971. was used for the second figure.82 Thus the whole scheme Harris, R., "The Marginal Drawings of the Bury St. Edmunds Psalter" was readily conceived and realized.
