<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAADIA'S GENERAL ETHICAL THEORY AND ITS RELATION TO SUFISM By ISRAEL EFROS, Dropsie College THE TENTH AND LAST TREATISE of Saadia's Emunot we-De'ot is devoted to the problem of human conduct, apart from the specific commands and prohibitions dealt with in the third treatise. The problem here is purely ethical, with a psycholog- gical background: How man can wisely arrange his life-pattern in view of the variety of tendencies to which he is subject. Saadia's answel is an affirmation of all the thirteen human tendencies or "loves", but with some reservat:ons. We shall tiy to deal (1) with a classification of these "loves," (2) with these reservations as compared with the Aristotelian doctrine of the mean, and (3) with the place of this treatise in the general pattern of this book, about which place some doubts have been raised. This third phase will involve Saadia's attitude to Sufism. i. Thirteen Loves According to Saadia, the good life is never one-sided, never dominated by any single tendency. A sound ethical theory should allow harmonious gratifcation of all human desires. "Even the heavens are not illuminated by just one star-so too man's conduct cannot be based by just one motive." 1 In this demand for an all-around pattern of life, Saadia follows Aris- totle, as against the Cynics who regarded the moral good as the only good, and also against the Stoics who looked on all things beyond morality as devoid of value, even if "desirable." 2 True, there is in his defense of the many-sidedness of the good life an I Emunot we-De'ot (Yosefov, I885), X, i, I98: 1"M?

First, if God is one, then creatures must be many i.e. each creature must be plural, not only in physical composition but also in his psychological make-up, in his drives and impulses. Secondly, if God is good, then all these drives and impulses which he implanted in us must also be good, 4 and "no wise man would say of what was made by the Creator: All is vanity." 5 This treatise of Saadia is there- fore a critique of all ethical theories that wish to limit life and reject instincts in the name of ethical monism. First he discerns in Ecclesiastes a reference to three ways of life, and he appearently connects them with the three faculties of the soul according to the Platonic division, so that wisdom stems from the rational faculty, rejoicing-from the appetitive, and habitation of the world-from the spirited faculty, i.e. from the intermediate power which gives rise to anger, striving, love of honor and other strong emotions 6. But he soon gives us a richer classification of human goals into, what he calls, "thirteen loves." But it seems that these too are arranged by Saadia according to Plato's tripartite division of 3 See Diogenes Laertius, VII, 87: "This is why Zeno was the first (in his treatise On the Nature of Man) to designate as the end life in agreement with nature." 4 Emunot we-De'ot X, i, I99: ;1"7 117k07 f :7f n "l 5 Emunot we-De lot X, 3, 2oo, Not all these "loves" are regarded as of equal rank.

Thus from the lowest faculty, i.e. appetition, stem the first four loves, i.e. from the second to the sixth desire: eating and drinking, sexual intercourse, eroticism, and accumulation of money. This classification is Platonic, and the reason for the inclusion of money under appetition is given by Plato: "because money is the chief instrument for the gratification of such desires." I Similarly Saadia refers to some who claimed that "food and rink and sexual intercourse, which are the basis of physical existence, are made possible by money." 8 From the intermediate faculty, spirit, stem the five inter- mediate loves: children, habitation of the world, longevity, dominance, and vengeance. And from the highest faculty, reason, come forth the three highest loves: knowledge, worship and rest. The last is not a sensuous desire, nor yet the child of spirit or conation of which it is indeed the opposite. It must be therefore a philosophical attitude towards life, hence stemming from reason together with the two previous desires. What is this philosophical attitude ? It seems that it is the Stoic apathy, an inner peace obtained through the expulsion of worry and the neutralization of all will and striving, or Pyrrhonistic ataraxy (oclrmpoci[oc) resulting from an utterly skeptical position towards all knowledge and enterprise. If we compare this thirteenth love to the thirteenth theory of crea- tion in the first treatise which too is the theory of Pyrrhonistic skepticism, we will see that the love and cosmogony come from the same school of thought. There Saadia says: "These however 7See Plato, Republic 580 E. 8 Emunot we-De'ot X, 8, 206.

Saadia could brook no doubts or hesi- tancy either in knowledge or in action. There is still a more inherent reason for this grouping of rest with worship and for Saadia's negative attitude, but this will be discussed later. 2. Sovereignty of the Intellect and the Doctrine of the Mean Thus all inclinations implanted in the human heart are good. How then can we achieve an inner harmony? Here we are reminded of the idea of the middle road as propounded by Aristotle. Malter remarks that Saadia was the first Jewish thinker in the Middle Ages to introduce this idea into ethics, but Saadia's conception is essentially different. Let us first note three points in Aristotle's ethical theory. First, Aristotle criticized Socratic intellectualism which iden- tified the good with knowledge ("to know the good is to do the good") and ignored the irrational part of the soul, such as in- stinct and character. 9 He therefore defined the ethical goal as giving reason power over nature. Secondly, the ruling reason chooses a middle road between extremes, between too much and too little, both of which are bad. Thirdly, this middle path is not determined by arithmetical calculation, as six for example is the mean between two and ten, but is subjective and relative, all according to the nature and circumstances of the person. Hence we need a "man of practical wisdom" (?pp6vL.o) who should define for us the mean. 30 Now as to the first point, Saadia emphasized it in various places. Reasonable man, he says, allows his natural impulses to 9 See Aristotle, Magna Moralia I, i, io82a 20. See also EthicaF Nichomachea VI, I3, 1144 b 8; VI, 6, 1I40 b 22. 10 EthicaF Nicomachea iio6 a 26-i io8 b 13; 1133 b 32 (In the Loeb Classical Library - II, vi, I 5).</page><page sequence="5">I70 ISRAEL EFROS be ruled by his intellect. 11 He took full cognizance of this irrational element which he called "nature." He saw the two opposite characteristics of human nature: on the one hand, the characteristic of sloth that seeks to avoid all that costs effort and pain-to avoid even some vital needs like food, clothing, and shelter, and a fortiori the quest for knowledge; and on the other hand, the passions which run after immediate pleasures without looking at consequences. Theiefore reason must be given power over nature through exercise, until the good becomes nature. 12 Sometimes Saadia points to the tripartite division of soul into reason, spirit, and appetite, and defines the good as the rule of the highest faculty over the two others, and evil as the revolt of the two against the highest. 13 And this is what differentiates the d.scipline of the wise from the discipline of the foolish, if the latter may be called discipline. 14 Thus knowledge, according to Saadia as according to Aristotle, is not enough to effect good conduct: one must struggle and overcome dark nature. But as to the doctrine of the "mean," Saadia makes no use of some such term, nor of the term "extremes," from an ethical viewpoint, in any place in the Emunot we-Decot. He had the idea, because he mentions it in the Tafsir Mishlei 15 but he does not use it in the systematic discussion of the problem. Here the viewpoint is deeply different. To Aristotle, the human 11 Emunot we-Decot IV, 4, 129: 1Y)tO X'M= Mk11UW t "3 ::1 |"N t FI;7 1M) ' IX N 7":W ;7777" 7.'D 13VP 97N 2 *,3 See also Saadia's in- troduction to his Tcafsir Mishlei. 12 Tcafsir Mishlei I: 33. 13 Emunot we-De'ot X, 2, I99; Tcafsir Job i: 6. 14 Emunot we-Decot X, 2, 199-200; Tcafsir Job i: 6; Tcafsir Mishlei I: 7; 22: 15. 15 In Tcafsir Mishlei 30: 9, the author states: 1R 7f5y77 Mn'tftl ,711=1 t)Tnn 71:" but this does not refer to the mean from an ethical standpoint.

For Saadia does not regard extremes as evil, as Aristotle does, because every "love" is im- planted by God in the human heart and therefore cannot be but good. Only, one must know the "place"-which includes time and measure-"because for each of our loves and hates there is a place where we must use it; and when we find the place, we must use it in the full measure required for the com- pletion of the act." "I will mention in the case of each love the place where it must be used, and for which it was created and set." 16 Thus as against Aristotle's mean, Saadia posits "place" (Ar. w7nn; Ar. anr), and there is a thorough going difference in conception. The Aristotelian man always seeks to excape from evil extremes and finds refuge in the mean; whereas the Saadyanic man is full of good inclinations, and always seeking situations for which they were "created and set." Paradoxical as it may seem, there is more struggle with sin in the man of the first kind than in the man of the second kind. But the third point in Aristotle's ethics, Saadia fully accepts. He too emphasizes the relativity of the measure, not only in each one of the thirteen loves but also in their combinations and fusions. "Man's behavior is a combination of his likes and dislikes in varying proportions." "It is not right to select equal parts from each of the thirteen; one should rather take -"St7W b1"S MnznW- ',1' 7'M= I= MWIV-* IMI: -iwm wj7 nx'T =PWI.* IM-I ItVM WjP?Z D;1 WIn - 5:): blnDtRI (I99, :, 'I) x"17 1n1tMI' (201, 7, ") :tLWT M11: 13 *lZ) 't1: Concerning the concept of "ineasure," see also X, I7, 212 and X, I9, 2I4, where the element of time is also noted, as in Aristotle, Ethica Nicomachea, iio6 b I7.

"It is not proper to take equal parts of each." 17 Since then no mechanical caculation can aid us, Saadia, like Aristotle, finds need for the "man of practical wisdom." This is the meaning of Saadia's remark: "Having stated in the introduction to this treatise that need requires a sage to arrange for us the likes and the hates and to show us how we should conduct ourselves with reference to them, I will say that I find the sage Solomon, the son of David, who dealt with this problem in order to inform us what is good! 18 Here in this passage the first mention of the sage does not refer to God, as some take it, but to the Aristotelian "man of practical wisdom." But elsewhere he says: "And if man is left to himself in order to understand what to choose in moral con- duct, nature would keep him away from his goal. Therefore the All-Wise, blessed and exalted by He, had to write in this matter a book by the hand of the wise Solomon, the son of David, peace be upon him." 19 Here ethics ceases to be autono- mous and becomes subservient to "wisdom and the Torah." 3. Contra Sufism Some maintain that this last treatise has no connection with the preceding treatises and is no part of the general pattern, that it must have been originally composed as a separate work and was joined afterwards. 20 This opinion seems without foundation. The treatise is well-connected, but some matters require clarification. This treatise deals, as we saw, with thirteen loves, or objects - 17 71 1 z-z PP,,. * tl^V tVt w.1 - .

The eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth, love are also conceived as forms of abstinence, namely the exclusive quest of knowledge, the exclusive love of worship, and the longing for rest as an euphemistic term fol laziness. Apparently, the whole treatise is aimed against abstinence, and the question arises: What abstinence does Saadia have in mind? What group practised it at that time? All descriptions of the abstainers, both at the beginning when he speaks about abstinence directly and at at the end when he deals with it under three different names, point to Sufism. It was this movement that Saadia aimed at in these chapters to show that it was onesided and destructive; only that, as was his custom in other discussions, he included in his condemnation others theories of conduct which too were narrow and one-sided. The name "Sufi" is, as is now accepted, derived from the Arabic word for wool. Indeed Bahya, in a description which parallels that of Saadia, explicitly refers to them as dressing in worn garments and wool. 21 The movement attained its highest development both in practice and in doctrine, both as asceticism and as mysticism, in the very place and time in which Saadia lived. Hallaj shook the Mohammedan world to its foundations with his mystic utterance ana 'I-haqq, I am the Truth, meaning God, the only reality, and he was publicly executed for this belief. It would be strange indeed therefore if Saadia, who joyfully tackled every opponent and many religious and philosophical doctrines that were not to his taste, 21 See Bahya, Hobot ha-Lebabot IX, 3: MID.71'V*= 1U IVZ )t3"tVIN 111w,71 21-7ti, 7x z1Wv);1 1h IntInz VIV)h!nnn nwR 2nlvv;7 71"557 (1 jxn1p~b5x 1nvz+n -+ -I) %it.,1 nv"n5zn avwz*1 ... 13 ,112,1 1 n"''l 'l Cf. ibid. IX, 6, where Bahya seems to identify the Sufi garb with the "hairy mantle and maintains that it was always the dress of the saints (13-TjP72 T-ronm W5 X1fl "). This is in keeping with his idea in IX, 2, 6 that the prophets were ascetics-a Sufi idea. See A. J. Arberry, Sufism, 35.</page><page sequence="9">I74 ISRAEL EFROS would remain silent on this movement that raged around him in his own city. The Arabic term for abstinence, zuhd, was indeed syn- onymous with Sufism in the first period of this movement. The Sufis saw only evil in this world, and longed for the world to come. They withdrew from human settlements, abandoned all their possessions, relying only on God, gave up all will and striving, refused human gifts or charity, even medical treat- ment. 22 One sect among them was called "weepers" (Ar. 71XD3X); 23 and Saadia apparently referred to this group in his statement: "There are some who maintain that it is proper for man to lead a life of abstinence, to wander out into the moun- tains and to weep and lament and mourn over this world." And Saadia concludes his criticism of this movement by pointing to the idea of place: "Abstinence is good for man when he prac- tices it in its proper place, namely when he is confronted with forbidden food or forbidden sexual intercourse or forbidden money." But this is indeed what the Sufis argued against, for they maintained that with reference to the forbidden (twln), zuhd applies to all Moslems, whereas they took upon them- selves this practice with reference to what is permitted (X7852) likewise. Saadia's discussion of the twelfth theory of conduct, the love of worship, speaks even more clearly about this movement. "There are many who maintain that the good life is only that of worshipping God, that man should fast by day and arise at night to praise and give thanks, to abandon all affairs of this world, for his God will supply him with food and medicine and his other needs." This is a clear description of Sufism, ex- 22 See D. B. Macdonald, Muslim Theology, 174-I80. It is true that also among the Karaites in Jerusalem of the tenth century there were abstainers and ascetics, namely, the 7'13 "17X. See H. Graetz, Ge- schichte der juden (Leipzig, I909), note I7, 6. But it is not these ascetics that Saadia means, for their asceticism aimed at the hastening of redemption, and no such national motive is mentioned here. 23 See Reynold A. Nicholson in Hastings Encyclopedia for Religion and Ethics, II, Ioo.</page><page sequence="10">SAADIA S GENERAL ETHICAL THEORY I75 tending even to their abandonment of medical care. By the statement "arise at night to praise and give thanks," Saadia probably hints at the Sufi-ceremony of dhikr, "remembrance," performed by the Sufi sometime at night alone in his house. 24 It is interesting that in his criticism, Saadia attacks especially the element of trust, the Sufic complete trust in God (Ar. tawakkul), which indeed exposed the Sufists to attack among the Moslems themselves, and because of which they were called muitawzakkilun, trusters, and were debating the question whether a mutawakkil may avail himself of medicine or not. 25 The Sufi doctrine of trust would naturally include that of "rest" (;nti'5), which he elsewhere regards as a high state, as the quest of the righteous in order to reach the light of God,26 but as a way of life he here condemns. He devotes however a 24 Nicholson, ibid. 102. 25 See I. Goldziher, Vienna Orient.

It is also Neoplatonic, as we find it in Plotinus, Enneads V, 3, 8; VI, 7, 2i, 22. But the Sufis gave it further development. In Sufism it is a preexistent light which is the medium of prophecy. It is the divine spirit which God breathed into Adam, identified with the Neoplatonic vo5q, which is the first emanation from the One, and with the Gnostic Logos which becomes incarnate in the prophets. See R. A. Nicholson, The Idea of Personality in Sufism (Cambridge University Press, 1923), pp. 43, 59, 6i. One can see how this Sufi speculation might have helped to shape Saadia's important theory of M'1*:L 11R, a created Light, also called Glory-a theory which exerted great influence on later Jewish thought, par- ticularly that of Judah ha-Levi and Maimonides. See particularly Saadia, Emunot we-De'Cot II, ii; Judah ha-Levi, Kuzari IV, 3; Mai- monides, Moreh Nebukim I, 5, Io, 64. Incidentally, Judah ha-Levi's expression in Kuzari IV, 13: li71 ?1 (Heb. R1;1 R171 =17D1) where the first 1M is generally taken to refer to man and the second IM to the Active Intellect, may be a Sufic expression in which 11 1M refers to God, but applied here to the Active Intellect. See Hallaj, Kitab al-Tawasin, ed. Louis Massignon (Paris, I9I3), I30; Louis Massignon, La passion dcal-Hosayn-ibn-Man- sour al-Hallaj, I, 254 and its index of terms. Comp.

All this proves that the last treatise was aimed against the Sufis. Its place in the general pattern of the book is now clear. Throughout the book Saadia emphasized the world to come as the purpose of creation and the aim of man. The question then faced Saadia: What attitude should man take to the world he lives in? Is not Sufism the clear answer-abstinence, turning away from all that is sweet and pleasant, escape from life? Our author's reply is: Man must satisfy his natural inclinations, provided he limits himself as to place, time, and measure, and he actively participates in human society. And Saadia is consistent. If the future world is the highest goal, and if it is an assertion of reason that reward for work done is better than a gracious gift, and work means fulfilling the commandments, rational as well as religious, 27 then escape from life and social duties is no way to reward. But there was some Sufism in Saadia's own philosophy, in spite of his defense of the human body in IV, 2 and VI, 4. Thus he wondered why the love for this world was implanted in the human heart, and tried various answers: "This love was placed in the human heart only that he may not kill himself in time of stress," or to serve as an aid in the study of the Torah, or as a step to the hereafter (X, II, 208; I4, 2IO; I7, 2I2). Thus also he maintained that love of high office and eminence was implanted in us only to stir the longings for the eminent reward in the hereafter (X, I2, 209); that laughter and jest are degrading, placing man on a level with beasts used to remove anthropomorphism (as on Gen. 17: 22, Ex. 24: 10; 33: 19, 22, 23; Num. II: Io. See also on Lev. 26: 12; Isa. 66: I); and sometimes it is used in translating the term 71:1 or Glory, i. e. Saadia's concept of the "second air," the medium of prophecy (as on Ex. 29: 45, 46; 33: 14, 15; Num. 17: 7), or the term 1lV), i. e. the prophetic spirit, which too is the second air (e.g. on Num. II, 29 and in Emunot we-Decot JJJ, io, 123). 27 Emunot we-De cot X, I 5, 2 I I.</page><page sequence="12">SAADIA'S GENERAL ETHICAL THEORY I77 (X, 3, 200); that fasting should be encouraged (V, 7, I46); that abstinence is still mostly true" (X, I4, 20I). 28 But all this was meant only to balance the soul, to provide counter weight to hedonistic inclinations. But it must be added that from doctrinal or mystic Sufism, Saadia sharply witdrew, that he never showed signs of the religious intoxication of tawhid in the Sufi sense of union or fusion with God. Saadia the rationalist kept the line tight between the above and the below. Hence we can hear an anti-Hallajian note in the opening of Saadia's book: "Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, who alone is worthy of being designated as Clear Truth." 29 The hint is: Man cannot call himself Truth. Only God is al-ha qq, and not in the Sufi sense of reality, but, as Saadia goes on, as a source of human reason and verification. Conclusions The last treatise, "On Human Conduct," was not meant as a separate work, but is connected with his general philosophy in which the hereafter is the goal of life, thus raising the question of attitude to this world. Saadia believed in an ethical pluralism, affirming all ways of life that flow from Platonic psychology; but his view differs from the Aristotelian c'mean" in iegarding all inclinations as God-implanted and therefore good, only awaiting their "place" or situation for, which they were originally "set." And the treatise is primarily a polemic with Sufism, though Saadia himself was not entirely free from its sombre atmosphere. 28 Ibid. X, II, 208; 14, 2I0; I7, 2I2. Concerning Saadia's pessimism, see V, 5, 143; X, 4, 201; II, 208. Saadia's general position is a theore- tical negation of this world together with a practical affirmation thereof as a place for social deeds to constitute provision for the road to the Hereafter. In this he is followed by Bahya in his Hobot ha-Lababot IX, 3. Extreme Sufism, which both Saadia and Baya oppose, negates this world both conceptually and practically. 29 EMUnot we-Decot, in the beginning of the introduction * 1VM (71wXn7 pn5x nr= jr pn5x) 11nn 70ml (7X:1z v)1 mw Other meanings have been proposed, but only Tibbon's seems possible. 12</page></plain_text>
