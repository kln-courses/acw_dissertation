<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IDEAL REAL: A Frustrated Impulse in Samuel Beckett's Writing Chris Ackerley Samuel Beckett's attraction to mysticism is most obvious in his interest in nega tive theology and the via negativa; but it first presented itself in aesthetic rather than religious terms, through Proust's concept of the "ideal real," as reflected in involuntary memory. For a time Beckett saw this as a viable aesthetic; that con viction was short-lived, but the "ideal real" left lasting traces on his work, though subject to increasing irony and the sense of the mind "devising." In Beckett's most deliberate account of the transcendental experience, Arsene's moment in the sun in Watt, the reality of the event is not in doubt but any validation of its mean ing is emphatically withheld. Marius Buning: An Appreciation I first met Marius at the Second International Beckett Symposium in The Hague, April 1992, when I was a 'very small Beckettian' and awed by the presence of so many celebrated figures. There I was exposed to many of Beckett's shorter dramatic, radio and television works, and I talked briefly with Marius, who encouraged me to submit to SBT/A my annotations of the addenda of Watt (my first major piece on Beckett), and was in subse quent correspondence both kindly and courteous. Our acquaintance was renewed at the "Beckett and Religion" conference organised by Mary Bryden and Lance St John Butler, in Stirling, September 1999, by which time I was a 'middle-sized Beckettian.' This small gathering of Beckett scholars, rather against the grain of contemporary scholarship, considered Beckett a major religious writer. I resisted (as to this day) the more ex treme claims made about the religious element in Beckett, and certainly attempts to claim him as any kind of apologist; but my presentation on Beckett, Thomas a Kempis, and the roots of quietism (Ackerley, 2000) was sympathetically heard, and, in return, I gained a greater awareness of</page><page sequence="2">60 Chris Ackerley the mystical elements in Beckett's work, which led to a sequel in Mystics Quarterly, on the impossibility of perfection (Ackerley, 2004). I had the further pleasure of two days with Marius in Edinburgh, where we dined together and went to bookshops and the opera. I learned more about his interest in negative theology and the presence of the via negativa in so much of Beckett's work, something I had not previously appreciated. In his piece in volume 9 of SBT/A, which included papers from the Stirling conference, Marius considered negative theology in the Beckettian text as more than systematic and even obsessive negation; rather, he saw it as a specific form of discourse that attempts to articulate the 'unsayable.' He traced Beckett's interest in the via negativa from Pseudo-Dionysius of the fifth century, through Meister Eckhart of the thir teenth century, to later mystical writers such as the so-called Rhineland Mystics and Saint John of the Cross, and finally to the writings of Jacques Derrida on this theme (Buning, 43-44). Marius argued the value of considering Beckett's work in the dark light of "classic negative or apophatic mysticism." Beckett's insistence on dispossession, self-annihilation, solitude, silence ("in short 'nothing ness'"), he considered, intimated equally the mystical experience, and he proposed that Beckett's late plays be seen as dramatic renderings of de scents into the Dark Night of the Soul (44). He noted the dialectical quali ties of negative theology: the paradoxical dualism of the affirmative and the negative; the infinite linguistic regress that relentlessly turns upon its own propositions to generate such paradox; and the temptation faced by commentators of "paraphrasing or re-writing the aporias and paradoxes of apophaticism in discursive, essentialist terms, thereby explaining them away and turning them into conventional theology or philosophy" (45). Marius then argued that Derrida's view of negative theology "opens up the way for a fruitful interaction between deconstruction and negative theology"; indeed, for a consideration of the "undoing" of Beckett's texts (to use Stan Gontarski's word) in terms of not only differance but equally of apophaticism (48). These insights were applied to Eleutheria, to link Victor Krap with Murphy, seedy solipsists both, in terms of their yearning for absolute freedom, Nothing, and non-being (50). There is a danger, which Marius did not always avoid, of reading Beckett's texts too closely in terms of negative theology. At Stirling, for instance, I recall Gottfried Btittner (whose interest in Rudolph Steiner and anthroposophy distorts his own reading of Watt) gently remonstrating that Beckett by his own admission had not read Meister Eckhart and Nicolas</page><page sequence="3">The Ideal Real 61 of Cusana until late in life, though he thereafter did so closely. In docu menting Beckett's engagement with negative theology Marius was with out the aid of the religious and philosophical notes that Beckett had taken during the 1930s (now at Trinity College and Reading University); nor could he then access the "Dream" Notebook, in which Beckett recorded the sometimes unexpected sources of his mystical awareness - an erratic Joycean 'note-snatching' rather than a sustained mastery of the theologi cal issues. Nor did Marius appreciate sufficiently, though he acknowl edged the issue (52), the importance to Beckett of Fritz Mauthner's cri tique of language, which, despite its plea for a "gottlose Mystik" (Acker ley and Gontarski, 359), is finally more godless than mystical. Neverthe less, I pay tribute to Marius as one who first attempted to chart these muddy waters and who saw in Beckett's writing a mystical impulse that would never entirely be denied. In what follows, I do not look at Beckett's use of negative theology, but instead discuss his early affirmation of the "ideal real" (a phrase po tentially as illuminating but equally as open to abuse as the via negativa or 'negative theology'). I consider this as an aesthetic principle in the later work, where it is no longer unequivocal; then I look at its manifestation in Watt, to see how it underlies the most precise account of the transcenden tal experience in Beckett's writing, that moment in the sun when Arsene feels that something has slipped. This frustrated moment of illumination (the 'way up') constitutes, in effect, a critique of the broad tenets of nega tive theology (the 'way down') that, as Marius would have appreciated, inform this enigmatic novel, but which are beyond the scope of this paper. The "Ideal Real" Towards the end of Proust (1931), following the evocation of the impris oned microcosm as "a vase filled with a certain perfume and a certain col our," Beckett defines the consequences of the unexpected advent of invol untary memory, of the Paradise that has been lost: The identification of immediate with past experience, the recurrence of past action or reaction in the present, amounts to a participation between the ideal and the real, imagination and direct apprehension, symbol and substance. Such participation frees the essential reality that is denied to the contemplative as to the active life. What is common to present and past is more essential than either taken sepa rately. Reality, whether approached imaginatively or empirically,</page><page sequence="4">62 Chris Ackerley remains a surface, hermetic. Imagination, applied - a priori - to what is absent, is exercised in vacuo and cannot tolerate the limits of the real. Nor is any direct and purely experimental contact possible be tween subject and object, because they are automatically separated by the subject's consciousness of perception, and the object loses its purity and becomes a mere intellectual pretext or motive. But, thanks to this reduplication, the experience is at once imaginative and em pirical, at once an evocation and a direct perception, real without being merely actual, ideal without being merely abstract, the ideal real, the essential, the extratemporal. But if this mystical experience communicates an extratemporal essence, it follows that the commu nicant is for the moment an extratemporal being. (Beckett, 4.544; emphasis added) Beckett's source is chapter 3 of Proust's Le Temps retrouve: Mais qu'un bruit deja entendu, qu'une odeur respiree jadis, le soient de nouveau, a la fois dans le present et dans le passe, reels sans etre actuels, ideaux sans etre abstraits, aussitot 1'essence permanente et habituellement cachee des choses se trouve liberee et notre vrai moi qui, parfois depuis longtemps, semblait mort, mais ne l'etait pas au trement, s'eveille, s'anime en recevant la celeste nourriture qui lui est apportee. (Proust, 15.15; emphasis added) But should a sound already heard, an odour breathed in bygone years, be renewed, at once in the present and in the past, real without being actual, ideal without being abstract, then immediately the es sence of things, permanent but usually hidden, is set free and our true being, that had long seemed dead but in other respects was not, awakens and quickens as it receives the celestial nourishment brought to it. (my translation) This experience, wrought by the agency of involuntary memory, consti tutes "an accidental and fugitive salvation" (Beckett, 4.524) that offers a solution to the Proustian equation through the obliteration of Time. Proust's world, Beckett insists, "comes out of a teacup" (523): by some "miracle of analogy" (543) a past sensation recurs to re-create the original experience, thereby confounding Habit and overcoming the gulf between</page><page sequence="5">The Ideal Real 63 past and present otherwise "interdit a nos sondes" (522). This constitutes "a participation between the ideal and the real," and such moments, Beckett insists, are "real without being merely actual, ideal without being merely abstract" (544); that is, they retain their physical immediacy though they must not be reduced to this ("real" reflects the scholastic uni versal, as much as the quotidian), but, equally, the Platonic experience of the timeless does not entail surrendering entirely to the world of forms. Or, to reduce this to a fundamental sound, it is a moment both in and out of time. I note Beckett's modification of Proust: the addition (twice) of "merely," to accentuate the difference between the "real" and the [merely] actual, the "ideal" and the [merely] abstract; that is, the sense of the mo ment as reflecting in psychological and secular terms (much as James Joyce had done with the 'epiphany') the mystical doctrine of the mind consubstantial with the transcendental. Perhaps Beckett's most explicit attempt to define the inexplicable, or, as Arsene later puts it in Watt, to "eff" the ineffable (Beckett, 1.218), the "ideal real" is difficult to gloss, without (in the words of Marius) re-writing its aporias and paradoxes in discursive terms, thereby turning it into the tropes of conventional theol ogy or philosophy. Even so, its sense may be intuited and the consequence affirmed: that the "ideal real" constituted for Beckett at the time of writing Proust the cornerstone of an aesthetic. Beckett was not unique in this. Joyce had largely devoted the final chapter of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) to the intricate attempt by Stephen Dedalus to formulate an aesthetic; this process contin ued into Ulysses. Beckett's sense of the "ideal real" (equally the critical assumption behind his 1929 short story "Assumption") may represent an attempt to recast his aesthetic intuitions in terms that invoke yet differen tiate himself from the Master. Nor were Joyce and Beckett alone among the Modernists in trying to capture the fugitive Funkelein (Inge, 17; Beckett 1992, 7), that which controls the moment in and out of time. Vir ginia Woolf in her later novels and in essays written for The Common Reader (in "Modern Fiction" she discusses Joyce's handling of perception and time) was concerned with how the atoms of consciousness fall and shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday (150). Ezra Pound, writing on the aesthetics of the Image, oiled the transcendental machinery, not least with his definition of the Image as "that which presents an intel lectual and emotional complex in an instant of time" (qtd. in Sullivan, 41), or in his sense of its workings as "the precise instant when a thing out</page><page sequence="6">64 Chris Ackerley ward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and sub jective" (qtd. in Sullivan, 54). T. S. Eliot responded to Pound's Image in his use of allusion as intellectual and emotional correlatives and, most explicitly in Four Quartets, to attend to illuminative moments. And there was Proust; I note, incidentally, that Woolf s metaphor of life as "a semi transparent envelope" (15) is lifted, like Prufrock's magic lantern, directly from Du cote de chez Swann (1.19 and 1.32). And, behind Proust, Berg son. .. Beckett, trying to formulate a viable aesthetic, was thus in key with his time. However temporary (pun intended), his affirmation of the "ideal real" has natural affinities with the finest literary practitioners of his age, who defined anew the fugitive relationship of the temporal and the eter nal. The best account of this, to my knowledge, is the essay by Stan Gon tarski, "Recovering Beckett's Bergsonism" (2008), which affirms the du ree (Pound's "instant of time") as the unit of intuition and apprehension. Gontarski documents the largely unacknowledged debts to Bergson in both Proust and Beckett, and he indicates how Proustian time and its cor ollaries, memory and habit, overlap Bergsonian time, or duration, to "of fer critiques of (or even solutions to) Cartesian duality" (97). While he acknowledges that Beckett found much to resist in Bergson, notably his explicit mysticism and its corollary, the elan vital (Macmann in Malone Dies rises only when the elan vital prods him in the arse [Beckett, 2.236]), Gontarski nevertheless proves that "Bergsonian material metaphysics" resolve the "Proustian equation" (99; Beckett, 4.524). Beckett calls this resolution a "mystic experience," but Gontarski spells out the problem that entails: thought must be segmented and ex tended to be examined and represented, but this "falsifies life's flow, du ree, as it is segmented and brought into the realm of space, and so repre sentation is always already doomed to failure" (94). Such failure is axio matic, inevitable, for in the words of Proust, quoted above, subject and object are "automatically separated by the subject's consciousness of per ception" (4.544). Pure duree "is unrepresentable, ineffable, and consti tutes for Bergson (and Beckett) a central metaphysical, ontological, exis tential, and so literary problem, the attempt to 'eff the ineffable, to repre sent, and so segment and spatialize, the flow of being" (Gontarski, 95). The great gulf between subject and object, a source of later frustration, is already implicit in Beckett's very formulation of the "ideal real." Beckett's evocation of the "ideal real" ends thus: "But if this mysti cal experience communicates an extratemporal essence, it follows that the</page><page sequence="7">The Ideal Real 65 communicant is for the moment an extratemporal being" (4.544). This statement would be later qualified or denied, but it represents a temporary solution to the Proustian equation as valid then for Beckett as it was for Proust. As Gontarski concludes, for a time Beckett accepted Proust's no tion of involuntary memory, or pure recollection (in the Bergsonian sense) as epiphantic (101); there is no protective irony to distinguish Beckett's aesthetic from that of Proust. However, the unity of the self with its past as implied in the acceptance of involuntary memory, and hence the onto logical independence of the ideal real, could not be maintained; the im plied unity between subject and object could not last; and the image (a falsification of life's flow) is, at best, an after-image (Gontarski, 104). A paradox is entailed: the immediate experiential reality of the extratempo ral experience; and the impossibility of being immediately conscious of that experience. As Eliot has it in the second movement of "Burnt Nor ton," once the visionary moment in the rose garden has faded, "To be con scious is not to be in time" (173). In the works after Proust, the ineffable experience remains fugitive for all Beckett's characters. What is in doubt is less the mystical experi ence itself, the sensation of extratemporality, as any value that might be placed upon it. As Eliot says in "The Dry Salvages," as he tries to recall the 'reality' of the Burnt Norton epiphany in the rose garden: "We had the experience but missed the meaning" (186). For Beckett's characters, how ever, and notably for Arsene, the later "approach to the experience" does not so much restore that experience (not even, in Eliot's words, "In a dif ferent form") as revive the frustrations that arise from a past that (pace, Proust) can be at best imperfectly regained. The Persistence of the "Ideal Real" in Beckett's Work The Beckettian equation is never simple. Although in Proust he postulated the "ideal real" as a viable aesthetic, he quickly discovered his sceptical and ironic voice. Dream of Fair to middling Women offers a calculated affront to Proust as hawthorn frames a defecating horse (1); and More Pricks than Kicks moves from the epiphantic structure of "Dante and the Lobster" to a parody of "The Dead" in "A Wet Night." As Beckett refined his aesthetic of failure and impotence against Joyce, so the "ideal real" crumbled as a serious affirmation, the more so when in 1938 he responded to Mauthner's Beitrdge (1923) which insisted that words were inane, verba inania, never "obviating the void" (Ackerley and Gontarski, 359).</page><page sequence="8">66 Chris Ackerley Yet traces of the "ideal real," often without irony, appear unexpect edly. Thus, Neary's imagination in Murphy, making its Joycean journey westward (a controlling irony, but the point holds), invokes in a moment of startling beauty: "Clonmachnois on the slab, the castle of the O'Melaghlins, meadow, esker, thatch on white, something red, the wide bright water, Connaught" (Beckett, 1.160). The cyclist in the "Rue de Vaugirard" (1937-39) exposes himself like a photographic plate to the instant; and moments in Watt (flowering currant, hints of Easter at the end of parts 1 and 2, the moonlight at Watt's departure) imply a beauty to which Watt is immune. Molloy, a classical case of romantic agony, rejects "this business of the moon" (2.36), but this is countered by an equal and opposite attraction to lyricism. The same impulse is manifest in Beckett's admiration of the art of Jack B. Yeats, the poetry of Holderlin, the paint ing of Caspar David Friedrich, and the Lieder of Schubert. In Endgame (1957), in a moment of involuntary memory, Nell sees to the bottom of Lake Como: "So white. So clean" (2.106). Krapp's Last Tape (1958) is structured on the contrast of voluntary and involuntary memory: the older Krapp wilfully seeks the monochromatic memories of his past but is hit, unexpectedly, by the unexpected memory of the girl in the punt. This re turns with intensity but (unlike Marcel's madeleine) represents a final failure of the Proustian ethos as it accentuates the desolation of the present rather than the fullness of the past retrouve. One recurrent motif is faces, seen suddenly in the clouds or sky. "Enueg II" (1931) sets worldly despair against a face in the sky, but as that image crumbles no veronica retains its impression. Many years later, in "Old Earth" (1974), the narrator sees memories that turn to faces, on the screen of the sky. In "Words and Music" (1961), Croak is over whelmed by the involuntary memory of a face seen "On the stairs"; the name "Lily" further invokes the epiphany of Joyce's "The Dead." Croak's meditation on the woman lost (ashes, starlight on earth again) culminates in a scene as erotic and moving as that which haunts the aged Krapp. Faces come and go in Beckett's last works, the vigil in "Still 3" leading to apparitions of the long dead emerging from the dark, not unlike the haunt ing visages of "What Where." Perhaps the most intense late evocation of this theme is "La Falaise" (1975), where the observing eye views the cliff and is integrated with its rocky face in a process that in its blending of perception and imagination virtually reconstitutes the earlier Proustian ethos.</page><page sequence="9">The Ideal Real 67 Beckett admitted to Charles Juliet that he liked the mystical spirit that "burns away filthy logic" (Juliet, 167). The later writing retains a concern with the mysteries of faith and their expression in the Western mystical tradition, but the sceptical impulse prevails. The unnamed narra tor of How It Is in parody of the ending of Joyce's Ulysses dismisses the transcendental experience: "yes all that all balls yes Krim and Kram yes all balls yes" (Beckett, 2.520), a curious use of the positive to subvert the affirmative, several yeses adding up to a final no, perhaps. Later works (Company the outstanding example) emphasise less the mind revisiting its past than reconstituting it. Memory here is more accurately "a joust be tween involuntary and creative recollection" (Ackerley and Gontarski, 361), the mind "devising" its experience. Joe, for instance, may be finally less a victim of his memories, involuntary or otherwise, than one re ordering them in his mind, like the narrator of "That Time," who shares Joe's final enigmatic smile as a curious order is obtained (a similar effect is devised in "The Image"). Such works mark a turn in Beckett's aesthetic from the evocation to the re-creation of the past, but this process is less the rejection of the "ideal real" when it was found to be metaphysically unsatisfactory than its adaptation to a different purpose, one finally devoid of transcendental meaning, but which uses mystical intimations to a dif ferent end. "Something Slipped": Arsene's Experience of the Transcendental In The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902), William James cites a passage from Walt Whitman's Song of Myself as "a classical expression" of the mystical experience: I mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning. Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth, And I know the hand of God is the promise of my own, And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own. And that all the men ever born are also my brothers and the women my sisters and lovers, And that a kelson of the creation is love. Eliot's "Burnt Norton" offers a similar experience: Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown-edged,</page><page sequence="10">68 Chris Ackerley And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight, And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly, The surface glittered out of heart of light, And they were behind us, reflected in the pool, Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty. In Watt, Arsene's experience, sitting on the step, in the yard, looking at the light, is another classical expression of the mystical phenomenon: "I was in the sun, and the wall was in the sun. I was the sun, need I add, and the wall, and the step, and the yard, and the time of year, and the time of day, to mention only these" (1.202). Arsene offers the uncomprehending Watt an account of that day, "when suddenly somewhere some little thing slipped, some little tiny thing." There is a crucial difference between the experiences invoked by Whitman and Eliot, and that described by Arsene, in that the first two are simulations of the mystical process in its immedi acy, whereas Arsene's is a recollection, a "falsification of life's flow" (Gontarski, 94). Nevertheless, something has happened, and Arsene tries to explain the inexplicable. He identifies a Tuesday afternoon, in October, as if spe cifics of time and place might somehow authenticate the experience. The sunlit wall, though he may not know this, invokes Vermeer's View of Delft with its little patch of sunlight that Proust's artist, Bergotte, drags himself from his deathbed to see again (Ackerley 2005, 62); just as Belac qua, in "Yellow," before his final misadventure, sees outside sunlight on the "grand old yaller wall" (Beckett, 4.206). The 'accidents' of the mysti cal experience are invoked with ironic exactitude: Arsene feels his breast swell, like a pelican's; he senses the change as "hymeneal"; he invokes a "great alp of sand"; and he describes his "personal system" as being "so distended" that "the distinction between what was inside it and what was outside it was not easy to draw" (1.202-03). Arsene trusts that he makes himself plain, yet he remains at a loss: But in what did the change consist? What was changed, and how? What was changed if my information is correct, was the sentiment that a change, other than a change of degree, had taken place. What was changed was existence off the ladder. Do not come down the ladder, Ifor, I have taken it away. This I am happy to inform you is the reversed metamorphosis. The Laurel into Daphne. The old thing where it always was, back again. (Beckett, 1.203)</page><page sequence="11">The Ideal Real 69 That is, the change was qualitative, not quantitative; but "degree" with its secondary sense of the steps of a ladder invokes the mystical scala perfec tionis (Inge, 9-10) by which the soul climbs to the knowledge of God; but, like Mr. Hackett earlier in the book (physically), Arsene has fallen off the ladder (metaphysically), restored (the reverse metamorphosis) to where he was, as he was. What remains is an unreliable memory of the experience, the immediacy of which, the psychological and physiological reality of which Arsene cannot doubt: But how did this sentiment arise, that a change other than a change of degree had taken place? And to what if to any reality did it cor respond? And to what forces is the credit for its removal to be at tributed? These are questions from which, with patience, it would be an easy matter to extract the next in order, and so descend, so mount, rung by rung, until the night was over. Unfortunately I have information of a practical nature to impart, that is to say a debt to pay, or a score to settle, before I depart. So I shall merely state, without enquiring how it came, or how it went, that in my opinion it was not an illusion, as long as it lasted, that presence of what did not exist, that presence without, that presence within, that presence between, though I'll be buggered if I can understand how it could have been anything else. (1.204) This constitutes not simply an evocation of the experience of the commu nicant as being for the moment an extratemporal being (Beckett, 4.544, cited above), but equally of the frustration that arises when the "commu nicant" senses after the event the impossibility of rendering the experience adequately, of representing it without falsification. Watt's tragedy is that though he listens to Arsene's short statement he does not profit by it. Subsequent efforts to understand various "inci dents of note" (1.231) end in frustration: the "pot" will not become a true pot (233), that is, it will not assume the qualities of the "ideal real"; the picture in Erskine's room, likewise, will not surrender its meaning (272 73); and he finally knows of Mr. Knott nothing (289). As Gontarski points out, part of Watt's problem is that whatever unity exists between per ceived image, memory, and the past is as accidental as the coincidence of dampers, hammers, and strings in Mr. Knott's piano, an image derived</page><page sequence="12">70 Chris Ackerley from Bergson's Matter and Memory (1896), where an "immense key board" executes "its harmony of a thousand notes" to ensure a correspon dence between "a great multitude of elementary sensations" and "the sen sory center" (Gontarski, 102). Watt's "ancient error" (1.283), the spasmodic desire to 'know,' leads him to understand the 'essence' of Mr. Knott by means of his 'acciden tals,' a kind of rationalism or 'positive theology' that, like the Cartesian methode it imitates, is doomed to failure. There are hints that this impasse might be overcome, though little comes of them: Watt was not always successful in his efforts to elicit something from nothing, but he was not always unsuccessful either, "for he was not" (1.229). For had he been al ways unsuccessful, he could not have spoken of the Galls father and son. the piano, and their "chooning" of it: No, he could never have spoken at all of these things, if all had con tinued to mean nothing, as some continued to mean nothing, that is to say, right up to the end. For the only way one can speak of noth ing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way one can speak of God is to speak of him as though he were a man, which to be sure he was, in a sense, for a time, and as the only way one can speak of man, even our anthropologists have realized that, is to speak of him as though he were a termite. (1.229) This parodies the language of negative theology: since positive determina tions would reduce God's substance to something finite, He must there fore be described in negative terms: "We do not know what God is; we can only say what He is not" (Alexander, 189, qtd. in Ackerley 2005, 96). As Molloy puts it: "What I liked in anthropology was its inexhaustible faculty of negation, its relentless definition of man, as though he were no better than God, in terms of what he is not" (Beckett, 2.35). Common to both anthropology and theology, Beckett believed, was the anthropomorphic assumption, as old as Protagoras, that man is the measure of all things, a sentiment for which he had ultimately little sym pathy. Hence an authorial comment in Watt, Watt's further wish to know the mystery of his master: "But this was an anthropomorphic insolence of short duration" (1.334). This could be because Mr. Knott is a transcendent being, and so unknowable; or it might simply reflect Watt's foolishness; the text, as ever, plays these intimations against each other. As it does</page><page sequence="13">The Ideal Real 71 with Arsene's sunlit moment: somehow, for reasons unknown, he has had a mystical experience, and it follows (in the words of Proust) that he was for the moment an extratemporal being, even though he does not under stand the experience and his account of it is inevitably falsified in the tell ing. The complexity of that experience is not unlike the Joycean epiphany or the Proustian moment, in terms of its rich orchestration and its sensual and psychological immediacy: this is (or was) the "ideal real" with its concomitant sense of the extratemporal. The authenticity of the transcen dental experience is not in doubt, but what differentiates Beckett from Joyce, for whom the epiphany was an affirmation in art of humanity, or from Proust, for whom the triumph over time had lasting aesthetic value, is the absolute and ultimately terrifying refusal to validate the moment in any meaningfiil way.
