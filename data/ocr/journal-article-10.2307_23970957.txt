In this monograph, the mature offspring of a 1998 Cambridge doctoral dissertation supervised by Robert R Gordon, Andrew Shead has made a valuable contribution to the continuation of the debate; he would not expect it to have provided 'the' solution. The nub of the question is whether the LXX reflects a Hebrew text 'earlier' and 'better' than that enshrined in the MT. The discovery of the Qumran Hebrew fragments 4QJerb'd has confirmed the existence of a Hebrew text with the same tendencies to shorten and rearrange as found in the LXX's presumed Vorlage (LXXV in Shead's terminology). This confirms that LXX is a translation of a different text, not an abridgement and rearrangement of one basically identical with MT. The LXX should, in this case, provide access, through retroversion, to this lost Hebrew, widely © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Jeremiah 32 (LXX 39) has been chosen precisely for the light its difficulties might shed on the character of both MT (the 'open book' of the title; cf. Jer. 32: 11, 14) and LXX (the 'closed book'). For Shead, therefore, LXX, although significant in its own right, is essentially a means, via retroversion, to clarifying a stage in the text history of the Hebrew. The recovery of LXXV depends of course on the credibility of the retroversions. Scholars disagree over the feasibility of this enterprise; those, such as Janzen, Stipp, and especially Migsch (who has also worked on Jeremiah 32), who believe that the translator produced a completely literal version, are more sanguine; others, such as Hardmeier, who argue that many variations between LXX and MT derive from non-literal renderings, are more sceptical. By using, and refining, both textual and literary disciplines, Shead hopes to provide more reliable pointers to how LXX might be 'unsealed' and so reveal the nature of the Hebrew it translates. His conclusion is that both MT and LXXV are revisions of an earlier Hebrew parent-text (in line with Τον, but against Janzen and Reimer, among others, who think there is insufficient evidence for full-scale redactions). He argues that, for Jeremiah 32 (39) at least, the differences are not extreme and are of degree rather than kind. MT has been further revised by expansion, LXXV by compression and rearrangement. MT's expansions are to improve clarity and tighten the structure, but are not otherwise tendentious; LXXV is more interested in establishing parallels between vv. 1-15 and the rest of the chapter, but these are different ways of structuring the same parent-text (LXX alters this common structure). In neither case does he find it necessary to posit a post-exilic redactor; he judges both texts to be internally coherent, despite the apparent confusion in changes of speaker. Where he differs from most other scholars—the majority of whom (including Τον) give priority to the shorter LXXV—is in refusing to declare, on the textual evidence he has considered, which text is the earlier or more 'original'. The lack of major differences between them suggests to him that they originated from a similar time, location, and milieu, but beyond that, until more work has been done on the rest of Jeremiah, he prudently refuses to go (LXX, he concludes, points to a different time and situation). On the matter of retroversion, he thinks LXX allows some degree of reliable access to its Vorlage, but</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 205 only provided a thorough investigation of the translator's normal working practices ('translation technique') has been carried out. Here, he parts company with Janzen and Stipp; he demonstrates convincingly that the translator is not always either quantitatively or qualitatively 'literal'; enough regularity can, however, be discerned to get some grip on the Vorlage. Like Lundbom, whose findings he anticipates in this matter, he identifies an unusually high number of divergences between LXX and MT, plausibly due to haplographic corruptions in LXXV; these diminish LXX's value as a 'better' text than MT (vol. ι of Lundbom's Anchor Bible commentary on Jeremiah appeared in 1999, after the completion of Shead's dissertation, and only covered Jeremiah 1-20; there is an acknowledgement on p. 150, n. 9; vols. 2 and 3 appeared in 2004). The accidental nature of the haplographic minuses can be shown from their random distribution, unlike other alterations, which, Shead argues, have been meaningfully organized. Unlike Lundbom, however, he does not downplay the translator's own competence; on the contrary, he shows how intelligently the latter wrestles with his difficult and damaged text. This is a significant result, the fruit of serious engagement with the translator's 'technique', to set against Lundbom's more categorical judgement. Shead's text-critical conclusions depend on his detailed analysis of the 'discourse linguistics' of Jeremiah 32. After a succinct Introduction, chapter 2 analyses the relationship between narrative and discourse in Jeremiah 32 within the context of similar passages elsewhere in Jeremiah. The (controversial) conclusion is that Jeremiah 32 has a coherent structure, in which vv. 6—25 constitute a narrative controlled by v. 2, with vv. 26-44 as discourse. The changes of speaker are not 'chaotic' (Meier) and do not point to later redaction. This lengthy, technical, and densely argued chapter is fundamental to Shead's contention that MT and LXXV are both self-consistent texts and can therefore be compared text-critically (despite the uncertainties in reconstructing the hypothetical LXXV). To make this compar ison, in the light of the findings in chapter 2, Shead divides Jeremiah 32 into four sections (vv. 1-15; 16-25; 26-35; 36-44) and examines them in a commendably thorough 'textual com mentary'; this forms the bulk of the book (chs. 3-6). There is extremely rich material here, with detailed discussion of key issues and full engagement with other scholars. Chapter 7 reviews the findings and discusses them in relation to questions of the origins and early development of Jeremiah.</page><page sequence="4">206 REVIEWS The originality of the monograph is to have investigated a way through the impasse that bedevils Jeremiah research when purely text-critical methods are used, by combining these with literary critical methods (as already urged by, for instance, Fernandez Marcos). One of Shead's aims is in fact to achieve greater objectivity in this double approach. In Jeremiah 32, he applies text-linguistic theory, and specifically discourse analysis, a method developed for the study of predominantly narrative texts (Genesis to Kings), to the very different 'idiosyncratic macrostructure' of Jeremiah (p. 243). It leads to a judicious critique of similar attempts, especially that of Migsch, who, Shead argues, has applied the method too rigidly, without allowing for the complexities of prophetic genres; this is an important advance. The recognition that contextual and exegetical motives have affected the text of both MT and LXX in places is also important. Where LXX is concerned, Shead's meticulous attention to translation technique enables him to take up position on the disputed question of the 'literal' nature of the translation and to form a sensibly pragmatic and nuanced view; he is surely right to argue that not all variants necessarily point to differences in Vorlage. This is a notable advance in LXX Jeremiah research and may well prove to be one of Shead's most serviceable contributions, whether or not it enables a more reliable basis for retroversion (as he hopes it will). There is no engagement with the thorny issue of the number of translators/revisers; Thackeray's 'translator β' is assumed without question, and Tov's reviser hypothesis is not mentioned. Although this is not particularly important for the study of Jeremiah 32 in isolation, it could affect Shead's findings for the direct speech formulae elsewhere in the book. The study is of course limited in scope by its concentration on one chapter. Shead acknowledge this and emphasizes the provisional nature of his findings, while justifying his method. With typical quiet humour, he divides Jeremiah scholars into 'butterflies' and 'caterpillars'. 'Butterflies' are those (including the influential Janzen, as well as, more recently, Stipp and Zlotowicz) who range over the entire book but who, inevitably, concentrate on passages relevant to their aims, running the risk of overlooking elements that might affect their conclusions (he demonstrates the questionable nature, for instance, of Zlotowicz's assertions on anthropomorphism). 'Caterpillars' (including Soderlund, van der Kooij, and several others) concentrate on smaller portions of text, which they investigate thoroughly; they run the</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 207 opposite risk of drawing conclusions for the whole book from insufficient data. Shead, of course, is a committed 'caterpillar', but one which sees beyond the edge of its own leaf; at any rate, the meticulous exegesis pays modest but real dividends. In the end, of course, both approaches are needed but, as Shead says, 'much more crawling over the landscape is required before the impressions gained from the air can be properly interpreted' (P· 257). Shead's own tentative 'view from the air' in his concluding sketch of the possible early history of Hebrew Jeremiah may prove less persuasive than the detailed exegesis of chapter 32 which forms its basis. The application of literary-critical methodologies to the text-critical debate produces new insights into both MT and LXX, although the full implication of using literary categories for textual decisions and historical reconstruc tions still needs to be more fully spelled out. His demonstration of the complex character of the Greek translation makes a valuable contribution to LXX studies, with relevance beyond the Book of Jeremiah. There are a few roughnesses, however. Terminology to categorize the direct speech formulas in chapter 2 is drawn from several different German sources; this makes for a certain lack of precision where precision is needed most. Structural sectioning is sometimes presented without adequate preparation, notably the fourfold division of Jeremiah 32, set out in an Appendix on pp. 264-9; the first section starts on p. 67, but its rationale has to be unearthed by going back to pp. 56-8, while the justification for 32:26—35 is not given until p. 165. Similarly, the 'four levels of communication', introduced on p. 27, are clearly defined only on p. 55. Short summaries would have been helpful in places, especially at the end of the innovative chapter 2, to make a better link with the more 'classic' treatment in chapters 3—6, and also at the end of each of these chapters. On the other hand, Shead provides a number of excellent tables, such as the one on pp. 61-2, which helpfully sets out the different patterns of discourse. Happily, most of the typographical errors which marred the initial printing have been rectified, though there is still faulty Hebrew wrapping on p. 28, n. 9, p. 248, and a dittographic 'that' on p. 53. On p. 19, the translation of כי as iv must surely be a mistake for on. In the process of clarifying the textual and literary character and potential of one small piece of text, Shead has provided a wealth of material and argumentation for further debate. Nobody working on the text history of Jeremiah, or on the</page><page sequence="6">208 REVIEWS character of LXX Jeremiah, should ignore his findings, or the path by which he has so patiently crawled towards them. doi:doi: 10.1093/jts/flj002doi: 10.1093/jts/flj002 JENNIFER DINES Advance Access publication ך December 2005 Cambridge j.dines@virgin.net Jennifer Dines</page></plain_text>
