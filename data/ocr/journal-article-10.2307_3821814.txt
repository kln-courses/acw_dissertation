KAPER Publication of the astronomical ceiling from the temple of Deir el-Haggar, and an interpretation of its contents. New parts of this ceiling were rediscovered in 1992-3 and a complete reconstruction is presented. On the basis of parallels, the ceiling's decoration can be dated to the second century AD. Notable aspects are the importance of the opposition of sun and moon, and the occurrence of a local version of the twelve gods of the lunar months. IN 1992 the Dakhleh Oasis Project together with the Egyptian Antiquities Organization embarked upon a joint programme of clearance and restoration of the temple of Deir el- Haggar. This temple is located at the western end of the Dakhleh Oasis and it was one of the last in Egypt to remain largely buried under its own debris. Previous clearance works inside the temple had been restricted to the sanctuary area, which was cleared in 1874 by the expedition of G. Rohlfs. In the 1960s, Ahmed Fakhry undertook some small- scale excavations mainly in front of the building, and the Dakhleh Oasis Project surveyed the entire area surrounding the Deir el-Haggar temple in 1978.1 During the recent operations inside the temple, large sections of previously unknown temple reliefs and objects have appeared, notably in the pronaos. These provide many new details about religion and artistic developments in Dakhleh in the first centuries AD. A full publication of the temple reliefs is s in preparation by the author. The present article is devoted solely to the astronomical ceiling from the sanctuary which, although it has been known since 1874, has never been studied as a whole. The drawingin fig. 1 presents the relief as reassembled and copied and copied at the time of excavation in 1992 and 1993. The drawing was prepared on site. Five photographs of fragments of the ceiling taken in 1908 are shown here in pis. XIV-XV, kindly provided by the Egyptian Art Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Those sections of the relief which are now lost entirely from the original have been added to the drawing in a thin line on the basis of these photographs. For the purpose of reference in this article, the four registers within the relief have been numbered one to four from the top (north side) to the bottom (south side). Physical description The room which functioned as the temple's sanctuary is situated at the rear end of the building (fig. 2). Its ceiling measured 3.25 X 2.42 m, comprising five slabs of sandstone, each approximately 0.54 m in thickness. Only one smaller section now remains in place * I am grateful to Drs Colin Hope and Harco Willems for reading a draft of this article and commenting upon various aspects. Much valued help was also received from Professor L. KAkosy. 1 The finds made by Fakhry at Deir el-Haggar are now displayed in the New Valley Museum, Kharga. A preliminary description of site 33/390-F9-1, which includes both the temple and the settlement area around it, was given by A. J. Mills, JSSEA 9 (1979), 178.</page><page sequence="2">N E S FIG. 1.

The other slabs, each of which measured more than 2.50 m in length, have been shattered into fragments of varying sizes. The original approximate width of these slabs was, from east to west: 71.0 cm, 73.0 cm, 74.5 cm and 72.1 cm. The smaller slab still remaining in position measures 39.0 cm. The carving of the ceiling has been exe- cuted in a shallow raised relief. Its design was drawn without the use of a grid and, apparently, not even a layout sketch had been prepared before the figures were drawn onto the ceiling. This becomes clear especially in the third register of the relief, where the individual elements of the design are drawn more spaciously on the right than on the left, suggesting that the sculptor worked from the rear of the room forward. This practice stands in contrast to the reliefs on the walls of the sanctuary, where the sculptor adhered to a conventional strict layout of the scenes. The ceiling had originally been plastered and painted. Traces of the following colours remain: LOCATION WITHIN THE CEILING the background colour, preserved in various locations the skin colour of the god Geb in the second register and of the left deity of the antithetical couple in the boat the dresses of the second goddess from the left in the third register and of the two anthropomorphic goddesses in the fourth register the disks which contain the left wedjat-eye and the child with the hand to his mouth the Red Crown worn by the falcon-headed Horus in the second register the skin colour of the right deity of the antithetical couple in the boat the White Crown worn by the falcon-headed Horus in the second register It is to be noted that, in general, this colour scheme differs from that of the walls of the sanctuary, where the skin of all divinities had been painted yellow, gods and goddesses alike, and where the background colour was white. 1995 177</page><page sequence="4">History of the ceiling's discovery o* / ^FTTI { | The first visit to Deir el-Haggar by Europeans in modern times was made in 1819, by an expedi- L/&lt; | ; tion led by A. Edmonstone, accompanied by Messrs Hoghton and Master. The rear part of the temple, with the sanctuary, appears from their description still to have been in good con- dition: 'The roof still continues entire over these three chambers, which are lower than the V/D rest of the building'.2 However, the roof must have been vandalized not long after their visit, /l XIA tVA\&gt;\s l\\ FA ( because in 1825 J. G. Wilkinson arrived at the _ / \ \ ^ ~\ F v \ \ I site and found the ceiling of the sanctuary, the adytum as he calls it, to be ruined: 'The adytum \ S \ ^L \ K\ |_ r_ and side adyta were lower than the other rooms; the roof of the north one alone remains. The FIG. 3. Redrawn copy of J. G. Wilkinson's middle one is much ruined ... As may further sketch showing a portion of the sanctuary ceil- be deduced from his terse description, one sec- ing seen by him in situ in 1825. tion of the original ceiling was still in place: 'in the adytum in north of ceiling ... with part of an astronomical subject'.3 Wilkinson made a sketch of this remaining section in his note- book, which is redrawn here for fig. 3. The traces of the ceiling which remain in situ even today, appearing on the right in fig. 1, were not remarked by Wilkinson. Apparently, the damaged state of this section of the ceiling, which has prevented its identification until only recently, was brought about at the same time as the destruction of the other slabs. G. Rohlfs was the leader of a geographical expedition which came to Dakhleh in 1874. In his publication of the expedition's experiences,4 he describes an excavation he had undertaken in the temple of Deir el-Haggar which aimed to uncover the decoration on the sanctuary walls. This work was supervised by the expedition's photographer, P. Remele. The large ceiling slabs of the astronomical ceiling were found lying face down in the debris. Rohlfs describes how they were carefully dragged out of the sanctuary, but no mention is made of any part of the ceiling still remaining in situ. The fragment drawn by Wilkinson had apparently been removed before their arrival.5 Photographs were taken of all the decorated stones found in the temple. These were subsequently shown to some of the leading Egyptologists of the day, namely, Lepsius, Brugsch, Duimichen, Ebers, and Mariette, who identified the names in the cartouches.6 Only Brugsch published a description of the fragments of the astronomical ceiling. However, owing to the missing Wilkinson fragment and the unrecognized fragment still 2A.

He found the temple reliefs to be of two distinct levels of quality and he concluded 'dass die feineren Bildhauerarbeiten von Kuiinstlern aus den Nilthale herstammen, wahrend die groberen von eingeborenen Oasenbewohnern gefertigt seien'.8 The most notable difference in the quality of execution amongst the different temple reliefs is that between the ceiling and the walls of the sanctuary, and it is undoubtedly this to which Ebers refers in his comment. In 1908, H. E. Winlock and A. M. Jones were the next scholarly visitors to the temple to leave a detailed description. In Winlock's monograph, not published until 1936,9 he describes having made hand copies of the inscriptions at Deir el-Haggar. Both he and Jones also took photographs of the ceiling blocks, which are reproduced here in pls. XIV- XV. For the publication, the artist L. F. Hall prepared a drawing of part of the astronomical ceiling which appeared as plate 23A. This drawing was based solely on these photographs of five large fragments which were found exposed in 1908. A large part of the ceiling could therefore not be included. For the section of the ceiling which had been recorded by Wilkinson in 1825, Hall's drawing was based on Wikinson's sketch (fig. 3). On the history of the ceiling slabs after Winlock's visit not much is certain. A number of tourists' graffiti are incised into the same blocks that Winlock saw, attesting their subsequent exposure. These graffiti, all in Arabic, contain the following dates: 1915; 4 October 1919; 1920 (?); 17 August 1921; 1921. After the latest date, a further three blocks disappeared beneath the sand accumulating inside the offering hall. In 1978, at the start of the survey carried out by the Dakhleh Oasis Project, only the two largest slabs remained visible, leaning against the wall where they had been placed by Remele in 1874. During the clearance work carried out in the rear part of the temple in 1992 and 1993, the individual fragments of the ceiling were all retrieved from the sand in the offering hall. The block which Wilkinson had drawn in 1825 was found shattered into small fragments inside the room to the south of the sanctuary. It is unclear why the fragments had been moved there, some time within the period between the visits of Wilkinson in 1925 and Rohlfs in 1874. Iconographical description and commentary As with most astronomical ceilings, the scene is surrounded by a bending figure of Nut. The goddess's feet were originally in the north-eastern corner of the sanctuary and her hands in the north-western corner. On Winlock's photograph in pi. XV, 2, the face of Nut is still partly visible, together with a small disk with one wing attached to it, which conventionally indicates the setting sun disappearing into the goddess's mouth in the evening. The north side of the relief is dominated by a large figure, which I believe depicts Geb, symbolizing the earth. Parallels for this acrobatic posture of Geb are to be 7Brugsch, loc. cit., identifies various elements depicted in the ceiling: the goddess Nut, the decans, the stars and the lunar Ennead. The latter he assumes to have been depicted on either side of the disk containing the left wedjat-eye, which shows that he did not succeed in reconstructing the original layout. 8As cited in Rohlfs, Drei Monate, 129. 9H.

His curled-up position may have provided the artist's inspiration for this unique iconography.14 The papyrus explicitly identifies the god as 'Geb, the father of the gods, the great god who made the earth and all that the sun encircles'. None of the four later parallels corroborates the god's name. A feature characteristic of the Graeco-Roman representations is the androgynous nature of the figure, which has replaced the sexual act depicted in the mythological papyrus as an indication of the god's fertility.15 At Deir el-Haggar the figure displays female hairstyle and breast, but the sexual organ is male (cf. fig. 3). Both the Philae and Dendara reliefs represent the figure with a female breast but without other distinctive female traits. As for male traits, the Dendara figure wears a beard, but no sexual organ is indicated. The Athribis tomb is too much damaged for its figure to be compared to the others. A text at Kom Ombo which describes the ascension of a number of gods into heaven, contains a unique epithet for Geb: Gb m snt, perhaps meaning 'Geb as the circum- ference', or the like.16 . It is tempting to consider this as a reference to the posture of Geb under discussion. The only iconographical parallel for a god in a circular posture is the figure of Osiris as depicted in the closing vignette of the Book of Gates.17 In the legend with this figure, the god is said to 'enclose the netherworld', just as Geb is shown surrounding the earth. The term employed in the Book of Gates to describe Osiris' action is the verb s'nj, which is most commonly found referring to the sun's orbit, as in the 10Pap.

Favard Meeks, La vie quotidienne des dieux egyptiens (Paris, 1993), 103. Even more remarkable in this vignette, however, is the personification of the sky over Geb as a male god also. Possibly this was done because the goddess Nut is already present in the adjacent vignette on the same papyrus and repetition was not deemed desirable. 5 The distinction is to be made between androgynous figures and purely male figures shown with pendulous breasts, as was noted by J. Baines, Fecundity Figures (Warminster and Chicago, 1985), 118-21. The breasts on the curled-up god are female. 16A.

KAPER YEA 81</page><page sequence="7">THE ASTRONOMICAL CEILING OF DEIR EL-HAGGAR mythological papyrus mentioned in the previous paragraph,18 but the term is also used to describe the circumference of the earth (snt n t;).19 Geb's extraordinary posture may have its origin in Theban representations of the Mound of Djeme (jft d&amp;-mt) which show a pair of outstretched arms to indicate the earth below the mound. The arms were ascribed to Horus (Twenty-second Dynasty) or to Geb (Twenty-fifth Dynasty).20 The development of this pair of arms into a complete figure of the earth god adopted the circular posture in order to depict the god surrounding the earth he personifies. In the traditional Egyptian world view, the earth's surface could be conceived of as a circular plane.21 The solar disk upon one of the arms of the Deir el- Haggar figure, as in several of the parallels, shows that the body of the god was thought to extend to the world's horizon where the earth is in direct contact with the sun. Similarly, in descriptions of the sun's course, a pair of arms belonging to an unnamed cosmic deity play an active role.22 There remain a few counter-arguments which could be brought against the proposed identification of the curling figure as Geb. In the first place, the androgynous body is not otherwise known in the iconography of Geb, although the god has inherent aspects of fertility. Furthermore, the Deir el-Haggar figure has what seems to be a lion's whisker added to his face. This may reflect the well-known leonine aspect of the god Shu, but it is not a known aspect of Geb.23 However, the same element may be found on the face of several other deities, who are not necessarily leonine in character, such as Min and Osiris.24 It is possible that the origin of this iconographical feature actually lies in the strap attached to the beard of the gods. The significance of these elements remains to be established, but their occurrence does not necessarily exclude the identification of this figure as Geb. In my opinion, there remains only one case to argue before accepting fully the identification of the figure as Geb. My interpretation supposes that it is the earth itself curve, as in the fourth section of the Book of Caverns (Piankoff, Le Livre des Quererts (Cairo, 1946), pl. 38; Hornung, Agyptische Unterweltsbiicher (Zurich and Munich, 1984), 361) and in Section D of the Book of the Earth (Piankoff, La creation du disque solaire (Cairo, 1953), pl. D; Hornung, Unterweltsbucher, 468). This seems, to my mind, a play on Osiris' lunar aspects, identifying him visually with the crescent moon. 18Geb may be described as ruler over the entire earth as enclosed by the sun's orbit, as in a hymn to the god at Koptos: (&lt; ssm &gt; =f wps m snt n jtn pdwt 9 m j;w n hr =f) 'His image which radiates within the orbit of the sun, the Nine Bows acclaim his face' (C. Traunecker, Coptos: Hommes et dieux sur le parvis de Geb (Leuven, 1992), 222 (text 42.9), 228). 19W. Golenischeff, Papyrus hieratiques (Cairo, 1927), 173.24-4 and 199.21 (Twenty-first Dynasty). 20In the chapel of Osiris hq;-dt in Karnak the right arm preserves the legend rmn Hr: R. A. Parker, J. Leclant and J.-C. Goyon, The Edifice of Taharqa by the Sacred Lake of Karnak (Providence and London, 1979), pl. 23 (21). The same scene recurs in the Edifice of Taharqa (ibid. pl. 22), with the legend rmn Gb preserved only for the left arm. Goyon, ibid. 53 n. 77, thinks that the two arms belong separately to Horus and Geb. However, in view of the lack of parallels for such a composite pair of arms, I assume that the earlier version ascribed both arms to Horus, and the later version both to Geb. It is possible that the Djeme iconography is derived from the pair of arms found in the last hour of the Book of Amduat, which indicate the division between the netherworld and the earth above. However, these arms are ascribed to Shu and they will develop independently into another type of full figure: Hornung, 'Zu den Schlussszenen der Unterweltsbiicher', MDAIK 37 (1981), 217-26. 21 Cf. the expression snt n to, referred to in n. 19. 22J.

KAPER which the god 'encloses' (snj). In contrast to the parallel figures elsewhere, at Deir el- Haggar the space enclosed within the curved body of Geb has been filled with a representation of the star sign Orion, as recorded by Wilkinson's sketch (fig. 3).25 Next to Orion there was originally a set of fourteen text panels, but nothing of the former painted inscriptions has survived. To the left of the Geb figure there is yet another image of Orion, which is clearly of astral significance in view of several parallels to this scene (see below). Therefore, I propose to identify the figure within the body of Geb as Osiris, with whom Orion was frequently identified.26 The figure would thus represent Osiris in his astral manifestation, which is in accordance with the celestial surroundings of the scene. This type of adaptation to the astronomical context similarly applies to the iconography of the goddess Opet in the fourth register, described below. Accepting the explanation of this Orion figure as Osiris, we might postulate that the fourteen panels next to the god contained the names of the fourteen members of the body of Osiris, which together constituted the god's entire body according to contemporaneous tradition. The reconstituted body of Osiris was a current metaphor for the country of Egypt, including the Dakhleh Oasis.27 Thus, through the use of the metaphor of Osiris' body, the Deir el-Haggar ceiling depicts the earth surrounded by Geb. This possible explana- tion of the scene also accounts for the different orientation of this part of the ceiling from the rest. The earth is depicted as the opposite of the firmament in order to distinguish clearly their respective domains. As noted previously, a figure of Orion occurs a second time in the ceiling to the left of the curled-up Geb. This figure is represented standing in a boat and, according to Wilkinson, wearing the White Crown and raising his left arm. He is followed by a second boat which supports a falcon on a standard and a goddess, who is doubtless to be identified as Sothis. The identity of this group is established by two close parallels at Dendara, where the figure of Sothis is depicted as a cow.28 On the right, but belonging to the same register, are representations of seven of the decans. To accommodate these figures, the register has been divided into two sub-registers, of which the upper contains five gods and the lower contains two, shown on the right. There are no traces of additional figures preserved between these and the arm of Nut which would have extended behind them. The decision to represent only seven of the thirty-six decans is hard to explain. It is clear that they represent but a small and random selection of the astronomical reality. Perhaps the number seven has been chosen in analogy with the group of seven demons 25 The disk which is carried in the left hand of the figure would originally have contained a star; his right hand conventionally holds a staff. 26Bonnet, RARG, 566-7; H. Behlmer, L/A IV, 609-11, s.v. 'Orion'. 27H. Beinlich, Die Osirisreliquien (Wiesbaden, 1984), 306-10. The number fourteen expresses the total of members of Osiris' body, which could be mirrored in a (fictitious) corresponding number of Egyptian nomes as a symbol for the cohesion of the country: ibid. 67-8; L. Pantalacci, CdE 62 (1987), 123. The number fourteen is not exclusive - sixteen is more commonly found, obtained by the addition of two Atef crowns to the god's members. On the theme of Osiris' dismemberment in the inscriptions at Deir el- Haggar, cf. 0. E. Kaper, JSSEA 17 (1987), 154; id., BIFAO 92 (1992), 127.

Both these seven demons and the decans may cause death and misfortune upon earth, and both groups are found represented upon astronomical ceilings.29 The remaining three figures in the lower sub-register include: a tortoise on a pedestal, a goddess, and a heron on a pedestal. The tortoise is a well-known element of astronom- ical ceilings, usually appearing as a pair of tortoises under the name stwy.30 It forms part of the decans, but, in the present case, its iconography is different from that of the other decans, who are of the 'Osorkon-type' in KAkosy's terminology.31 The tortoise represents a constellation which was, in fact, specifically associated with the Nile flood. Its rising coincided with the heliacal rising of Sirius which marked the coming of the inundation.32 It is likely that this symbolism applied also here. Reference to the flood waters of the Nile may seem surprising in the temple inscriptions of an oasis, but the theme seems to be relevant for the fertility of the region, as it is not uncommon in the Dakhleh temples.33 The triple theme of the first register, combining Sothis on the left, the fertile earth god in the centre, and the inundation of the Nile on the right, has recently been discussed by Desroches-Noblecourt, who relates the theme to the liminal period of the epagomenal days and the renewal of the year.34 The nature of the goddess facing the tortoise remains obscure, but the heron may be identified as the planet Venus. It is the only planet represented in the ceiling. The selection here of only one of the five planets known to the ancient Egyptians may have resulted from insufficient space on the ceiling, but a different explanation for the presence of Venus is put forward in the discussion of the fourth register, below. The second main register of the ceiling is filled with a defile of sixteen gods facing a disk containing the left wedjat-eye. This is a well-known representation symbolizing the phases of the waxing moon. One by one, these gods are to unite with the moon until it is full.35 The deities in the group may be identified as part of the Theban Ennead, 29The seven demons occur upon the ceiling at Esna, section E, together with the decans (Esna IV. 1, nos. 443, 445), and also in the destroyed north temple of Esna (EAT III, no. 47 pl. 29). For these demons, see V. Rondot, 'Une monographie Bubastite', BIFAO 89 (1989), 264-7 and id., 'Le naos de Domitien, Toutou et les Sept Fleches', BIFAO 90 (1990), 315-31 with references. The Egyptian perception of various astral influences on earth has been described by L. Kakosy, 'Decans in Late-Egyptian Religion', Oikumene 3 (1982), 187-91. S.

The only other instance in which a single tortoise has been represented is found at Dendara, in the western Osiris chapel (PM VI, 100), reproduced in P.

KAPER because they are headed by the god Mont, identified by his feather crown with a double uraeus. The Ennead thus contains: Mont, Atum, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Thoth (taking the place of Seth in the original Ennead of Heliopolis),36 Isis, Nephthys, Hathor, Horus, and four additional male divinities. The latter are almost certainly to be identified as the four sons of Horus, who are found in this context at Edfu.37 Even though the significance of this register is clear enough, the number of gods represented poses a problem. This number is elsewhere in the present context never higher than fifteen, because the gods correspond with the individual days of the first half of the month.38 Perhaps we ought to assume a mistake here in the design on the part of the Deir el- Haggar hierogrammateis, but it may, in fact, be a case of our misunderstanding the symbolism involved.39 I will propose an explanation below, as suggested by the interpreta- tion of the ceiling as a whole. The central band dividing the ceiling into a northern and a southern part derives from the Ramesside Book of the Night, where the band contains a row of stars.40 At Deir el- Haggar, a number of deities intrude upon the band. Two groups are depicted, both of which show the sun and the moon united and in opposition. On the left, two figures stand in a boat holding hands. The left figure, whose head is lost, carried a sun disk with an uraeus on his head, traces of which remain. The right figure has a human face and a moon disk on his head. A close parallel for this group may be found in the tomb of Psenosiris at Athribis,41 where the head of the left figure is that of a falcon. The appearance of the two gods holding hands brings to mind a late spelling of the verb snsn, 'to unite'. To the right of this group is a scene which is similar in concept, showing two boats carrying a sun disk with a child (left) and a moon disk with a baboon (right) facing each other. The baboon refers to the moon god Thoth42 and the child to the rejuvenated sun.43 The third register of the Deir el-Haggar ceiling is paralleled exactly by a scene in the pronaos at Esna, which was decorated in the late second century AD.44 The scene has been redrawn in reversed direction for fig. 4, to facilitate comparison. The space available at Deir el-Haggar was much more restricted than in the case of Esna where the scene spans the entire width of the pronaos, which is approximately 20 m in length.

The goddesses have been reduced from twelve at Esna to six at Deir el-Haggar and the number of worshipping baboons from four to one. The scene depicts the nightly course of the sun from the west to the east, divided into three stages corresponding with three different manifestations of the sun god. The only significant difference between the Esna rendering of the scene and the one at Deir el- Haggar is the inversion of the first and second boats in the latter. In the order of the boats at Esna (fig. 4), the first boat on the right carries the god Atum, belonging to the evening, the second boat carries the ram-headed nightly form of the sun god and the third boat contains the scarab transformation of the sun god belonging to the early morning. Each phase of the sun's course has been divided from the next by a series of six goddesses, which together represent the total number of the hours of the night. These goddesses, who accompany the sun's nightly course, may be traced back directly to the New Kingdom Book of Gates and ultimately to the Book of Amduat.45 These goddesses are followed at Esna by three mal e deities whose role is uncertain. At Deir el-Haggar the goddesses remain in place, albeit reduced in number, and the three gods are also present. Strangely, the Atum figure has been drawn in the central position in the register, which renders the meaning of the scene much less evident than the Esna version. At Deir el- Haggar, the identity of the god is indicated by the hieroglyph of his name upon his knees.46 The three figures in the bow of Atum's boat, whose identity I do not know, were moved, together with the god, into the second boat. The boat on the right, which is pulled by three jackals, carries an empty disk. The lunar crescent at the right end of the register is also present at Esna and this seems to symbolize the moon taking the sun's place in the evening sky. An additional moon disk over the bark on the right is not contained in the Esna version. This disk seems to be yet another depiction of the same topic, referring to the rise of the full moon at the moment of sunset. However, as Winlock's photograph of the scene (pl. XV, 2) shows, the disk was deliberately obscured by a coating of plaster and replaced by a large text panel. The significance of this change in design is unclear. The plaster has now vanished entirely and both the original and later designs are visible simultaneously. The fourth register depicts again a row of divinities. At either end we find depictions of two of the winds. Figures of the four winds are often present in astronomical scenes, but their iconography varies considerably.47 Only two of the winds are present at Deir el-Haggar and, according to the closest parallels, these may be identified as the east wind 45 In the eleventh hour of the Book of Gates and the seventh hour of the Amduat: Hornung, Unterwelts- bucher, 291 and 138 respectively. The scene from the Book of Gates is published in Hornung, Das Buch von den Pforten, I, 369-71; II, 261-2.

XV, 2) in accordance with the depictions in the temples of Deir el-Medina, and of Opet in Karnak.48 Alternatively, according to parallels in the Esna temple, they may be the north wind (the winged scarab, as in Esna II, text 128) and the south wind (the ram, as in Esna II, text 105). The significance of the winds in the context of the ceiling poses a problem. At Armant and Dendara, the four winds indicate the cardinal points. That only two winds are depicted at Deir el-Haggar is perhaps because of lack of space, but a different interpretation is possible if we assume the choice to have been deliberate. Each of the four winds is known to have played a specific role in Egyptian beliefs,49 and they could be interpreted by the priests in predicting the future, as is attested by the inscriptions of a court astronomer from the early Ptolemaic Period.50 The same text, moreover, mentions the planet Venus in combination with certain decans. The evidence for this type of divination is meagre, but the possibility arises that this practice might have influenced the composition of the ceiling. The otherwise unexplained presence of the planet Venus with the decans and the selection of only two of the four winds could find their explanation here. The specific virtues which were ascribed to these elements are unfortu- nately unknown. A temple inscription from the oasis dating to the reign of Augustus records a remarkable tradition which may be relevant for Deir el-Haggar as well. This text speaks of 'the four winds which come out of the body of Nut', indicating an otherwise unattested relationship with this goddess.51 The location of the two winds at Deir el-Haggar corresponds with two corners of the relief and thus with two of the cardinal points. In view of this local tradition, however, it is equally possible that the winds were thought to be connected to the mouth and vulva of the sky goddess. Above the winged scarab, a bull is shown facing right. In the ceiling of the demolished mammisi at Armant, a bull occurred in the same position with a pendant figure of a scorpion in the ceiling's opposite corner.52 The combination with the scorpion shows that the bull represents the zodiacal sign Taurus, whose celestial opposite Scorpio has been omitted at Deir el-Haggar. For the presence of this element I am unable to put forward any explanation.53 The identity of the remaining figures between the two winds is somewhat problematic because there are no parallels for this group. The number of gods, twelve, suggests within the present context a possible relation with the hours of the day or night, or with the months of the year. In fact, the group shares similarities with the latter, as shown on the astronomical ceiling in the Ramesseum and the astronomical frieze in the temple 48C. de Wit, 'Les genies des quatre vents au temple d'Opet', CdE 32 (1957), 25-9. 49 D.

Thus, the first month is represented by the goddess Hathor because the 'festival of drunkenness', which was celebrated in her honour, was held on the 20th of the first month. The first month of the lunar calendar was, moreover, named after this festival (t4y).56 The last god in the row is Re-Harakhty, after whom the last month was named as Mesore, a name adopted also in the civil calendar which still survives in its Coptic version today. As for the remaining gods in the group of twelve, it seems that only the ninth and tenth deities correspond to the ancient lunar calendar months, because the figures resemble Khonsu and Khenty-Khety respectively.57 A lack of parallels for the remaining gods leads me to attempt to apply a similar reasoning to account for their occurrence. These eight remaining gods may reflect a different, perhaps a specifically local, tradition of representing the lunar months. The second figure of the group of twelve represents the goddess Opet, whose presence may be explained by the name of the second month of the civil calendar, Phaophi, which was named after the Theban Opet festival. Theban influence in the temple decoration at Deir el-Haggar is common, as is explained below, and the adoption of this goddess from the second month of the civil calendar suggests that the civil and the ancient lunar calendars were no longer differentiated around this time.58 The goddess appears in the guise of the star sign which is depicted as a hippopotamus with the back and tail of a crocodile, standing upon lion's paws and lean ing on a mooring post. She holds a bull's leg in her hand, which depicts the constellation of the Great Bear. This astral version of the goddes s Op et has dou btless been chosen rather than her regular appearance because of the common presence of this star sign in astronomical representations.59 Behind Opet stands the god Tutu upon a pedestal. This god is not exceptional in astronomical scenes either; he occurs in the zodiac tomb at Athribis and at Esna on the 54The Epigraphic Survey, Medinet Habu, VI (Chicago, 1963), pl. 478, and EAT III, no. 8 pI. 5 (Ramesseum); Parker, The Calendars of Ancient Egypt (Chicago, 1950), 43-5 (227), pl. v (Edfu). 55Bonnet, RARG, 470, and esp.

This date roughly corresponds to the date of the Deir el-Haggar astronomical ceiling, see below. However, it would stretch the evidence too much to suggest that the ceiling reflects exactly this coincidence of the two calendars. It is more likely that the ancient lunar calendar, which was preserved only within the temples and which was recorded in the Ptolemaic Period only at Edfu, had lost its significance at this time. 590n the astral role of Opet-Nut, see E.

KAPER pronaos ceiling, in both cases in the company of the 'pseudo decans'.60 However, the present context is different, and I suggest that the god is placed here in third position in the row of month gods because one of Tutu's festivals was celebrated in the third month of Athyr, as is attested by the calendar in the temple of Esna.61 The remaining deities in the row are unfortunately not clearly identifiable. We can merely suggest the possibility that the fourth god might depict Osiris and the month of Khoiak, and the sixth god, who is falcon-headed, might represent Horus, whose festival of victory was celebrated on the 21st of the sixth month Mechir. The presence of Tutu among the gods has already shown that the selection of deities in the row has been influenced by regional cults. Tutu was one of the local deities of Dakhleh Oasis, venerated in his own temple at Kellis (Ismant el-Kharab) and repre- sented several times in the tombs at Muzzawaka near Deir el-Haggar.62 We may therefore expect other local divinities to appear as well, such as Seth, the Lord of the Oasis, who had a festival in Dakhleh on the 25th of the eighth month Pharmuthi.63 Also, it is possible that one of the falcon-headed gods represents the god Amun-nakht of Dakhleh, none of whose festivals is yet known.64 Within the Dakhleh temples, the emphasis upon the local deities of the oasis appears to be a dominating feature of the decoration.65 Moreover, we can point to the extreme conservatism displayed by the Dakhleh dating systems employed in the Greek papyri found at Kellis. The oasis is exceptional in its use of the ancient year of 365 days even as late as the fourth century AD.66 The present interpretation of the twelve gods in the fourth register as a local version of an antiquated type of calendar does not, therefore, stand isolated. The presence of the twelve months of the year fits the context of the ceiling well. It is instructive, in this respect, to compare the Deir el-Haggar ceiling with the frieze on the north wall of the pronaos at Edfu.67 Here the following groups of deities, most of which are paralleled at Deir el-Haggar, are depicted in a long row: 60At Esna, Tutu occurs in section E of the ceiling (Esna IV.1, no. 445, 42; for the iconography cf. ibid. no. 118).

Nevertheless, the composition of the gods within the group of twelve months varies considerably between Edfu and Deir el-Haggar. It seems that, at the most, four deities correspond. The assumption made here, that the Deir el-Haggar ceiling contains a local variant of the gods of the months, based upon local gods and their temple festivals, suffers from a lack of parallels. It is, therefore, presented with much hesitation. The ancient lunar calendar is not attested in any other temple of the Graeco-Roman Period, which clearly shows that this tradition had become virtually obsolete. In my view, the Deir el-Haggar hierogrammateis attempted to infuse the tradition with a new life and relevance by replacing some of the gods with appropriate contemporary characters. The space enclosed by the body of Nut has been divided into a southern and a northern half. Yet the distribution of the figures over the ceiling does not correspond to this bipartite arrangement. Sirius and Orion belong to the southern group of stars, but they appear here in the northern half of the ceiling. The same applies to the star signs of the hippopotamus and the Great Bear, which correctly belong in the northern sky, but are shown in the southern half of the ceiling incorporated into the depiction of Opet. Apparently, the distinction between east and west was more important for these stars, because they are all located at the eastern end of the sky at the moment of the heliacal rising of Sirius, when it is in conjunction with Orion at the beginning of the new year. The importance of this moment in the astronomical ceilings is evident, as it regulates the changing of the year and the coming of the inundation. The closest iconographical parallels for the ceiling as a whole are from the two Roman tombs at Athribis, as well as the exact parallel provided by one of the sections of the pronaos ceiling at Esna. These parallels can each be dated to the second century AD and I think, therefore, that it is justifiable to propose a second century date for the Deir el- Haggar ceiling also. This means that the ceiling was a later addition to the temple's decoration, which had been largely finished during the first century. The differences between the ceiling and the walls of the sanctuary in style and colouring, which were noted above, would corroborate a later date for the ceiling's execution. The style of the ceiling extends to a scene on top of the eastern wall of the sanctuary, which was, therefore, probably added at the same time. This scene shows the ithyphallic Amon-Re within a sun disk, being adored by the Hermopolitan Ogdoad, in the role of the god Amon of Hibis. It is possible that the scene was considered as an extension of the astronomical ceiling, as it depicts the sunrise in its correct geographic location.68 68A reliable drawing of this relief may be found in Winlock, Ed Dakhleh Oasis, pl. 22. The heads of the male members of the Ogdoad are exceptionally rendered as rams' heads. Winlock already noted the resemblance in style between this section and the astronomical ceiling (ibid. 30). A comparable addition of a scene of sun worship to a depiction of the Book of the Night is found in the royal tomb KV 6 of Ramesses IX; cf. F. Abitz, SAK 17 (1990), 30 fig. 9. 1995 189</page><page sequence="16">OLAF E. KAPER The role of the astronomical ceiling in the temple decoration at Deir el-Haggar First of all, it seems important to point out that the location of the astronomical ceiling at Deir el-Haggar is exceptional. As was recently summarized by Cauville,69 astronomical ceilings in temples are commonly located in rooms with natural light (the pronaos and wabet) or in rooms with a mortuary significance such as the Osiris chapels at Dendara and inside the temple of Medinet Habu. The latter are related to the astronomical ceilings in royal and private tombs in royal and privatthose fountombs and upon the lids of sarcophagi, as well as to those in the subterranean chapels in the ibis galleries at Tuna el-Gebel.70 The Deir el-Haggar ceiling is one of only two situated in the sanctuary of a temple, without mortuary associations. The other instance is the demolished mammisi of Armant, which dates to the joint reigns of Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy Caesar.71 Nevertheless, despite this exceptional location, it appears that the iconography of the Deir el-Haggar ceiling is not at all unusual, nor was that of Armant. Nearly every element of its composition can be found elsewhere in other astronomical ceilings in tombs as well as temples. It has been suggested by Goyon that the location of the ceiling inside the temple buildings could be related to an actual astronomical observation point upon the roof,72 but this does not explain the situation at Deir el-Haggar, where a high wall prevented the observation of the horizon from the roof of the sanctuary. An important theme developed in this ceiling is the division of time. The first register is connected to the changing of the years marked by the years marked of theSi rising of Sirius and the advent of the inundation. The second register relates to the days of the month, corresponding to the lunar phases, and the third to the hours of the night with the hour goddesses and the nightly course of the sun. Finally, the fourth register seems to reflect the months of the lunar calendar. Thus the four major divisions of time, as divisions of time, as distinguished by the Egyptians, are distributed over the four registers of the ceiling, just as in the Edfu frieze referred to above. In the third register the number of gods had to be reduced as a consequence of the limited space available for the scene. Similarly, it seems that a number of other celestial events have been omitted which are known from the larger astronomical ceilings of the period. The moon's phases have only been represented by the first half of the month, the second half being omitted. Likewise, the sun's nightly course depicted in the third register is not complemented by a depiction of the daily course. Not wishing to condemn these choices as arbitrary, I will try to look for a reason which could have motivated the selection of exactly this combination of scenes in the Deir el-Haggar ceiling. The ceiling is notable for the central position it accords to the union of sun and moon. The close association of the two heavenly bodies is known also from other astronomical 69Cauville, Le temple de Dendera: Guide archeologique (Cairo, 1990), 36. 70Nearly all examples have been published in EAT I-III. Not included there, apart from the present example, is the astronomical ceiling in the destroyed temple at Akhmim, which seems to have included more than just the block EAT III no. 65 (K. P. Kuhlmann, Materialien zur Archaologie und Geschichte des Raumes von Achmim (Mainz, 1983), 37-8). At Aswan, a loose block depicting some of the 'pseudo decans' in the manner of the astronomical ceilings was found within the temple of Isis (E. Bresciani and S. Pernigotti, Assuan (Pisa, 1978), 278-9 no. 53). Some of these loose blocks may originate in Elephantine (W. Kaiser et al., MDAIK 49 (1993), 162 n. 96). In addition, Egyptian astronomy was adopted in Napata and Meroe (J. W. Yellin, Meroitica 7 (1984), 577-82). 71 For this ceiling, which shows only the bent body of Nut, Orion and the four winds, cf.

There are only a few parallels for this theme, found exclusively upon the astronomical ceilings in the private tomb chapels at Athribis. A relief in the tomb of Psenosiris at Athribis depicts the sun and moon gods holding hands in the attitude of snsn,74 and within the same register the opposition of the disks themselves is shown, with both placed upon the sign for 'horizon'. The zodiac tomb at Athribis has the two disks within boats facing each other. The solar boat is adored by the b;w jmntt and the lunar boat by one baboon, representing the b;w jPbtt, in a situation which recalls the moment when the full moon rises in the east (j;btt) while the sun sets in the opposite horizon (jmntt). This moment of the opposition of sun and moon is referred to in Egyptian texts as snsn-k'wy, 'the uniting of the two bulls'.75 The term employs.the metaphor of the bull for both the sun and the moon, designating them as equals.76 The theological and liturgical significance of the moment of opposition has been demonstrated for the temple of Edfu by Cauville.77 Here the rejuvenation of the lunar and solar cycles is represented in a series of scenes in and around the central sanctuary, which is considered to be the starting point of their cycle at the moment of opposition.78 The Theban texts, however, contain a slightly different interpretation of the opposition in the context of the local theology. This interpretation is relevant to the Deir el-Haggar reliefs, because the temple's gods and local theology were largely adopted from Thebes. Amon-Re of Deir el-Haggar is explicitly and repeatedly referred to as the god of Karnak (hry-jb Jpt-swt).79 The Theban interpretation of the opposition of sun and moon is most clearly expressed in a text upon the gate of Ptolemy III Euergetes in front of the temple of Khonsu at Karnak; 'the left eye unites with the right eye; Khonsu unites with Amon'.80 731In the Dendara pronaos, the moon is depicted as following the boat of the sun (EAT III, no. 59), as also in the eastern Osiris chapel on the roof of the temple, in the inner room (EAT III, no. 55, pl. 37). The tomb of Psenosiris at Athribis contains the same theme (EAT III, no. 56, pl. 38A). 74EAT III, no. 57, pl. 39. I would amend the drawing of the disk upon the right figure in the snsn group to a moon disk. 75Herbin, BIFAO 82, 280 (3) gives a list of occurrences in the texts, to which the following may be added: Edfou I, 255.6; Edfou III, 208.1; Epigraphic Survey, The Temple of Khonsu II, pl. 115.9; Clere, Porte d'Everg&amp;te, pls. 5, 12, 60. The term k;wy is in half of the cases written as a dual and in half as a plural. Regularly it has the hb (feast) determinative, as have the names for most celestial events. 76 On the designation 'bull' for the sun and moon, see Bonnet, RARG, 732 and 471 respectively. 77Cauville, Essai sur la theologie du temple d'Horus a Edfou, I (Cairo 1987), 8-12 § 8.

The significance of the moment of opposition was recognized already in the New Kingdom, as is evident from the description of the phenomenon in the cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos: H. Frankfort et al., The Cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos (London, 1933), I, 85-6; II, pl. 85.32-3. The two statues of a scarab and a baboon inside the solar chapel at Abu Simbel were associated with the opposition of sun and moon by C. Ziegler, in Desroches-Noblecourt, Ramses le Grand (exhibition catalogue, Grand Palais, Paris, 1976), 159. The conjunctions of sun and moon formed part of priestly knowledge. In the Twenty-sixth Dynasty an astronomer claimed to 'know the movements of the two disks' (r4 nmtt n jtnwy): L. Borchardt, ZAS 37 (1899), 11. One of the books of the temple library in Edfu carried the title 'knowing the movements of the two lights' (Edfou III, 351.9: rh nmtt n bpyty), and this book is still mentioned as one of the four 'astrological books of Hermes' by Clement of Alexandria: Sauneron, Les pretres de l'ancienne Egypte2 (Paris, 1988), 159. 79Herodotus, IV, 181, records a previous 'borrowing' of the Theban cults by a temple in the oases, probably referring to the temple at Hibis or that in Siwa; cf. Leclant, BIFAO 49 (1950), 240; K. P. Kuhlmann, Das Ammoneion (Mainz, 1988), SOf. 80Clere, Porte d'Evergete, pl. 27, Randzeile with Khonsu-Thoth. At Edfu this moment is expressed in similar terms, but without identifying the sun and moon with Amon and Khonsu; e.g. Edfou I (revised edition, 1984) 84. 1995 191</page><page sequence="18">OLAF E. KAPER The exact moment of opposition and union is explained further elsewhere on the same gate: '(Khonsu-Horus) beautiful image of the left eye who unites with the right eye in the horizon, when he appears in the east in opposition (snsn-k;wy), while the "maker of millions" (the sun god as creator) is in the west; who takes his (the sun's) place, when he (the sun) enters into his mother (Nut)'.81 Elsewhere inside the Khonsu temple, Khonsu is described as he 'who unites with his father at the opposition'.82 This is not the place to enter into the many details and complex ramifications of this theme in the Theban mythology and in the local temple rituals, but the point I wish to make here is that in Thebes, as in other places under Theban influence, the sun and moon are said to act out the divine succession. The sun god Amon leaves his position to his son the moon, identified with Khonsu. The moment of opposition signifies the moment when the son assumes the role of his father in a divine succession. The Theban explanation of the opposition relates the cosmic succession of the sun by the moon to the continuation of divine rule over creation.83 I think that this mythology is also relevant for Deir el-Haggar. The personified representations of the sun and the moon, which occur twice within the central band of the ceiling, have been purposely kept out of the discussion of the ceiling thus far. One of these groups suggests the word snsn, and their different skin colour may suggest a difference in generation between the two.84 The second group, on the right, also shows the two disks facing each other with the sun god depicted in his rejuvenated state as a child. The theme of opposition has, in addition, influenced the composition of the two central registers. The extended ennead of gods in the second register ensures the monthly waxing of the moon, culminating in the appearance of the full moon in opposition to the sun around the fifteenth day. This is an important theme also in the temple of Khonsu at Karnak, where it is always depicted together with the gods of the second half of the month (see n. 35). As was remarked above, the missing second half of the month at Deir el-Haggar could have resulted from the small space available within the register. In the light of the theme of opposition, however, it is possible to suggest an explanation for the reduction of the month to the surprising number of sixteen gods. The full moon occurs every 29.53 days, when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the earth. However, the important moment for the temple was the joint presence of both the sun and the moon above the horizon, which can only occur after the moon has become full. There is some seasonal variation in the exact moment when this takes place, but generally, the phenomenon will be observed on the sixteenth day. Therefore, I think that the lunar 81 Clere, Porte d'Evergete, pl. 5, Randzeile with Khonsu-Horus. On the title nbj-hh for the sun god, cf.

Luft (ed.), The Intellectual Heritage of Egypt (Budapest, 1992), 425. C. Traunecker, Cahiers de Karnak, VI (Cairo, 1980), 192-3, and J.-C. Goyon, YSSEA 13 (1983), 2-9, discussed specifically the combination of the royal succession and the lunar cult at Karnak. The clepsydra of Necho from Tanis (EAT III, no. 34, fig. 9, pl. 22B) carries a vignette of Amon-Re and Necho holding hands in the snsn attitude. Within the astronomical context of the clepsydra, and knowing the Theban character of the Tanite theology, it is possible to interpret this scene as the passing on of the divine rule from god to pharaoh. 84As is suggested for the Old Kingdom by H. G. Fischer, JARCE 2 (1963), 20-1. This reference was kindly brought to my attention by Harco Willems. The validity of the same colour code in Roman Dakhleh appears from Shrine I at Kellis (Ismant el-Kharab), where it has been employed to distinguish Khonsu and Harsiese from their respective mothers Mut and Isis (scenes as yet unpublished). 192 JEA 81</page><page sequence="19">THE ASTRONOMICAL CEILING OF DEIR EL-HAGGAR ennead at Deir el-Haggar depicts specifically the first half of the month leading up to the moment of opposition on the (theoretical) sixteenth day. The third register of the ceiling features the setting sun. The deliberate arrangement of the four registers results in the juxtaposition at one end of the sanctuary of the full moon in the second register with the setting sun in the third register. Incorporated into their respective contexts, this yields yet another representation of the moment of opposition in the relief. The emphasis placed on the opposition of the sun and moon at Deir el-Haggar seems, therefore, clear, but can this feature be explained? From a study of the reliefs upon the walls of the temple, especially those in the recently uncovered pronaos, which was decorated in the name of Titus, it has appeared that the gods Amon-Re and Khonsu are accorded almost equal status at Deir el-Haggar. Moreover, the moon god Thoth was also an important member of the local pantheon, as is shown by his occasional position of prominence in the temple decoration. This may be explained by the existence of a cult of Thoth centred upon a nearby temple.85 The divine spouses of Amon and Thoth, Mut and Nehmet-awai, appear consistently in secondary positions within the temple. With these three main gods in mind, I venture the suggestion that the triple repre- sentation of the opposition of sun and moon on the astronomical ceiling of Deir el-Haggar depicts three different aspects of the cosmic union. From right to left (west to east) these are: the sun and moon uniting first in their cosmic manifestations as disks; their union then as the sun god Amon-Re (the child, symbol of rejuvenation) and Thoth (the baboon);86 and finally as the gods Amon and Khonsu in their personified appear- ance. The result of the union is the continuation of divine rule, in accordance with the ideas developed for the Theban theology. Conclusion In order to clarify the significance of the astronomical ceiling within temple decoration in general, I would like to finish by citing one of the most instructive of several ancient inscriptions pertinent to this matter. It is a text from the temple of Kom Ombo, but it summarizes the important elements of all astronomical ceilings and their immediate relevance for the temples and their gods: As long as the sky will rest upon its four supports, as long as the earth will remain stable upon its foundations, as long as Re will shine during the day and the moon will shine at night, as long as Orion will be the Ba of Osiris and Sothis will be the ruler of the stars, as long as the inundation will come on time and the cultivable land will produce its plants, as long as the north wind will come out on time and as long as the flame (the south wind?) will devour what exists, as long as the decans will provide their 85Amon and Thoth are depicted upon the soubassement of the pronaos in parallel positions, each receiving gifts brought by the pharaoh and the fecundity figures. The important position of Thoth appears also from the votive stela to Thoth which was found at Deir el-Haggar: G. Lefebvre,ASAE 28 (1928), 29-34. On the neighbouring temple dedicated to Thoth, cf. Kaper, BIFAO 92, 128-30. The same gods were venerated at Bahriya Oasis: A. Fakhry, Bahria Oasis (2 vols.; Cairo, 1942-1950), I, 154, 158, and II, 3, 25-39; G. Wagner, BIFAO 74 (1974), 26. 86That Thoth could also partake in the divine succession at the opposition of sun and moon is suggested by the title mcr-4rw, which the god bears exclusively in the context of the full moon: Herbin, BIFAO 82, 274 (43); Chassinat, Le temple de Dendara, III (Cairo, 1950), 19-20; and a Theban example, Clere, Porte d'Evergete, pl. 29 (divine Randzeile). 193 1995</page><page sequence="20">OLAF E.

(after Gutbub)87 This text shows the reverse side of the holistic world view held by the ancient Egyptians. In the perspective most commonly expressed in the ancient texts, the aim of the Egyptian temple cult was to help maintain the order of the universe. The universe was seen as a multitude of actions controlled by the gods, in which mankind could exert a limited influence.88 The temple cult is based upon a world view from the human, earthly perspective and it is this view which is stressed by the decoration on the walls of the temples, which show the human element characteristically in an active pose.89 Conversely, the astronomical ceilings depict the world's cosmic processes on an exclu- sively divine level, in which human action plays no part, and where the gods are shown regulating the continuous process which is the universe. A beneficial influence over this process is exercised by the stars, the inundation, and every other element of the universe which could be linked to the gods, and it is directed to the temples on earth, as is indicated in the Kom Ombo text.90 The eternal cycles of the stars, which determine time, ensure the cyclical renewal of the world. I think that it is this belief which underlies the main purpose of the astronomical scenes in the temples, but in no lesser degree also those in mortuary contexts.91 From such depictions of the cosmic renewal, the deceased in their tombs or the gods in their temples would benefit.92 The Deir el-Haggar ceiling thus shows the march of time with the recurring years, months, days and hours of the cycle in which the gods of the temple participate. Depicting these events would make them magically effective and eternally present.93 In addition to to time's rhythmic renewal, the ceiling carries figures of the two most favourable winds (?) and the beneficial conjunction of Venus with some of the decans. The latter may represent knowledge derived from popular divination pratices, which may also account for the inclusion of the zodiacal sign 87KO 423, dating to the reign of Ptolemy VIII Euergetes, translated in Gutbub, Textes fondamentaux, 32-3. A similar version is also found in Esna II, no. 147, dating to Domitian. 88J.

The mythology of the creation supplies the 'historical' background for the current situation as depicted by the astronomical reliefs.
