<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS. PESSIMISM "IN EXCELSIS." Europa-Rosja-Azja. Szkice Polityczno-literackie (Europe, Russia, and Asia: Political and Literary Sketches). By Prof. M. Zdziechowski. Wilno, I923. PP. 336. ANOTHER modern Apocalypse! There has been no lack of predictions of coming evil to our civilisation during the four years of the troubled and unhappy state called Peace which have now followed the four years of war. In Germany, Oswald Spengler, in a grandiose work, prophesies " the ruin of the Occident" (Der Untergang des Abendlandes); in France, G. Batault has been inspired by the works of Marshal Foch to write a book under the eloquent title La Guerre Absolue. In Poland a physicist, R. Swietochowski, even had the extraordinary idea of interpreting the coming universal equality of Socialism as a social analogy to the physical end of the world, on Clausius's theory of the transformation of all energy into warmth and the equal distribution of that warmth throughout the universe. A Polish philosopher, Florian Znaniecki, has spoken of the " Fall of Western Civilisation," with considerable insight and profound emotion, in a recent book. All these, and some other rhapsodies of modern Cassandras, are passed in review by Professor Zdziechowski in his concluding chapter, significantly entitled " The End of Europe." What is his own personal contribution to the philosophy of contemporary history.? He summed up the results of many years of research in his favourite field-religious currents in XIXth century literature-in a work in two volumes, published on the very eve of the war, and therefore not duly noticed. He called it--significantly again-" Pessimism, Romanticism, and the Foundations of Christianity." The book was chiefly noticeable for the prominence it gave to Schopenhauer as an epoch-making factor in XIXth century thought. Again and again the author expressed it as his profound conviction that only a full realisation of the fact that " the heart of the sons of men is full of evil" (Eccl. 9, 3) can produce a real religion. Like Cardinal Newman, whom he admires, he considers the doctrine of original sin as an appropriate symbol for a truly philosophical view of the world. In the new book, which in its outward form is simply a collection of his war-time and post-war essays and addresses, the author has dotted the i's of his pre-war philosophy. Repeatedly in it he declares himself to be a confirmed pessimist, and he elaborates his philosophical theory of evil into the proposition that only a full sense of the utter</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS. 667 irrationality of the world-process can be the foundation for a religion and the stimulus for Man's endeavour to fight evil. Now the present reviewer happens to be an optimist by nature. This difference, being one of temperament, cannot usefully be argued about. But he differs from Professor Zdziechowski yet further in thinking that only a belief in the essential rationality of this world can encourage Man to any active exertion, and that every kind of God which Man believes in, is and must be (however inadequate and anthropomorphic) a rationale of the Universe. But the book deals more with current political problems than with first principles. The reviewer regrets to say that here again, he differs from the author on most of the vital points of his argument. It is perhaps fair to begin with the one on which he most fully agrees and sympathises with him. In a chapter from his diary of I917, called The Legions and the Polish Cause, Zdziechowski gives a pro- foundly affecting account of the tragic dilemma which all Poles lived through when Poland's two greatest historical enemies-Germany and Russia-went to war. But it was surely political quixotism to attempt, as Professor Zdziechowski then did in Petrograd and Moscow (partly in the presence of his present reviewer), to explain and defend before Russian audiences the attitude of those Poles-Pilsudski and his legionaries-who solved the problem for themselves by taking armis on the side of Austria. The samne quixotism of a noble idealist prevails throughout in Professor Zdziechowski's truly startling treatment of certain important post-war issues. The relation to Germany may be taken first. As a graduate of a German university, I can only sympathise most warmly with the author's desire to see the best German tradition-the ideas and ideals of a hundred years ago-revived in German culture and public life. Professor Zdziechowski's German sympathies centre round his personal friend, the noble F. W. Foerster, well known before the war as a zealous propagandist of Christian principles in educa- tional theory. Since the war, he has turned from individual to civic education, and in his endeavour to re-awaken the better soul of Germany, he has unearthed a forgotten thinker, Constantine Frantz, who, in the very period of Bismarck, made a last chivalrous stand on behalf of old German philosophical idealism against new German imperialism, and incidentally expressed sympathy with Polish aspirations. Professor Zdziechowski follows Foerster into these fields. But I cannot, unfortunately, share the hope he cherishes (or at least, cherished before the Rapallo Agreement of I922) that the highly desirable intellectual rapprochement with the best elements of Germany can possibly, in any near future, culminate in a political understanding between the nations most immediately affected by the Bolshevik danger-principally Poland, Germany, and Hungary- towards a common defence of the values of civilisation against the Soviet foe.</page><page sequence="3">668 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. And what can be said when we see the naive credulity of an idealist scholar carried so far as to perceive a moving strain of patriotic honesty and an idealistic conception of Imperialism in the Memoirs of Admiral von Tirpitz, which, like so many other recent German Memoirs, are simply an attempt to shift a responsibility consciously and proudly borne in times of prosperity, on to the shoulders of others in a period of misfortune? The present writer has himself been deeply moved by reading in the published " Siberian Diary" of his fellow-prisoner Dr. Breitner (of Vienna) of the personal tragedy which the catastrophe of the Central Powers meant to a German patriot: but this was a sufferer of the rank and file, and not one of the great actors who themselves had shaped events. From Germany we may pass on to pre-war Austria. Professor Zdziechowski fondly remembers the complete self-government which Poles enjoyed there, and treats the person of the dead Emperor Francis Joseph with chivalrous reverence and gratitude for it. Now the reviewer, although himself brought up in an atmosphere of idolatrous personal worship of the aged Monarch, cannot at present see in his behaviour to the Polish nation more than a wise political opportunism forced upon Austria by her crushing defeats before and in i866. And he cannot forget how this same Court of Vienna petted Ukrainian nationalism in Eastern Galicia, not out of any sympathy with national aspirations, which would have been generous enough, but on the principle of divide et imipera, as applied to the growing power of the Polish element in the Dual Monarchy. These things, however, are ancient history now. The part of the Dual Monarchy which has survived-Hungary-presents a more actual problem. Professor Zdziechowski was known even before the war for his Hungarian sympathies.' They are easily understood when we remember some historical facts: Poland and Hungary, both isolated in this respect among their mediaeval neighbours, developed Parliamentary constitutions based on a " gentry democracy," in the later ages of feudalism; both were military outposts of Christian Europe against Islam and waged age-long wars against it; finally, there was hardly any friction between them in the course of their historical relations since the time of King Louis the Great of Poland and Hungary (in I374), owing to the beneficent dividing range of the Carpathian mountains. In I849, the Polish General Bem led the Hungarian insurrectionists against Austria and her Russian allies, and Hungary's greatest poet, Pet6fi, was his aide-de-camp. All this has found due expression in national feeling, and the writer of this review has himself felt the stirrings of temperamental sympathy with chivalrous and cultured Hungarian officers who were his fellow- prisoners in Bolshevik Russia. But for all that, active sympathies with Hungary do niot come within the range of practical politics for 1 He gave expression to them after the war in his French pamphlet La Tragddie de la Hongrie et la Question polonaise (1921).</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS. 669 Poland, and there is a moral reason for this, too. Hungary has been savagely enough treated after the Peace of Versailles; some of this injustice has now happily been redressed by her admission to the League of Nations. But whatever injustice there may have been, was surely only a historical Neniesis for the equally savage and entirely Prussian treatment of Slavonic nationalities within the borders of the Hungarian kingdom before the war. In his opinions concerning the Western Allies, Professor Zdzie- chowski is reserved enough, as far as France is concerned; but he is very outspoken as concerns British Imperialism. There is, in his view, very little to choose between that and Gerinan Imperialism before the war. The present writer, having devoted his life to promote the better knowledge of English civilisation in Poland, must, of course, disagree most emphatically on this point. Without entering into details, for which a " Slavonic Review" is not the place, one general line of argument may safely be taken. Professor Zdzie- chowski, at different times, wrote very ably both on Polish and on Russian " Messianism "-that is to say, on the romantic conception prevalent at one time anmong each of these nations tha-t it was the " chosen nation of the Lord " in modern history.' He ought, there- fore, to be better qualified than anybody else to appreciate the nmoral force and dignity which is imparted to the efforts of British Colonial administrators by the (latent and inarticulate) conception that they are the chosen instrument of Providence in bearing the " White Man's Burden " among their fellow men of different colour in various quarters of the globe. This has brought us to the crucial test of any Pole's political philosophy-his attitude towards that nation which, in one way ot another, has considered itself all along as the " Chosen People" of this contemporarv world-the Russians. Professor Zdziechowski has a well-deserved reputation of being the Pole who is most intimately acquainted with modern Russian intellectual life; his lifelong friend- ships with such great Russian thinkers as Vladimir Solovyev and Eugene Trubetskoy, and such writings of his as his German book Die Grundprobleme Russlands (1907), give sufficient warrant for that. His view of what has happened, and is happening in Russia, is naturally determined to a large extent by his profound sympathy with his friends amnong Russian intellectuals, who are now leading a homeless life of exile abroad. In the eyes of the present writer (who spent all the critical seven years, I9Ij-2I, in Russia), they are certainly quite as worthy of human sympathy as were the Polish emigrants in Paris after the national catastrophe of I83I. Unfortunately, their political efforts amnidst an apathetic Western Europe are quite as discordant, and above all, as weirdly unreal, as were the countless memoranda showered by those Poles upon the Foreign Offices and 1 Cf. his Polish writings: Messianists and Slavophiles (i888), The Rock of Messianism (I912), The Vision of Krasinski (I9I2).</page><page sequence="5">670 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. Parliaments of the West. Their fruitless interventionist propaganda has tainted Protessor Zdziechowski's argument with some of its unreality; and so have their ceaseless denunciations of Bolshevism, which have, by overemphasis, done the anti-Bolshevist cause more harm than good. The author repeats, with approval, the declaration of a recent refugee from Russia (Zenaida Hippius, the wife of Demetrius Merezhkovsky) that, in answer to the frequent inquiries in Europe as to civilised institutions in Soviet Russia, it can only be said that nothing of the sort exists. Of course, this is a misrepresentation of the truth. There is hardly any large town in Russia which has not now got a " Popular University " with some ten Faculties, or a "Polytechnic High School "; hardly any v illage which has not got a " Proletarian Culture " circle and a " People's Theatre." The trouble is not that nothing exists where there was something before; on the contrary, something exists very often where there was nothing before (as in the Siberian forest village of Tayshet, midway between Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk, where I lived in I920, to see even Dalcroze's rhythmical gymnastics tauglht!) : the real complaint is that what exists, or has been called into existence, is barbarously mismanaged, vilely misused, or inefficient to the lengths ot caricature, and unfitted to real needs. One part of the great problem of what is to be done with Soviet Russia is the question-now purely academic-what Poland should have done with Soviet Russia after the war of I920. Professor Zdziechowski, who is a native of the district of Minsk, where his paternal estate lies, has a ready answer to this question he joins with that saintly figure, Bishop Lozinski, in denouncing the Peace of Riga between Poland and the Soviets as a political crime. Poland ought not to have stopped half way, but to lhave earned the gratitude of Russian patriots themselves by rescuing the whole of the old Poland's White Russian and Ukrainian provinces from Soviet tyranny. It is easy enough to say so for one who does not himself bear the burden of active political responsibility: but one must consider how much this wouild have added to the difficulties which the new Poland already has to meet in her endeavours to reconcile, in districts of mixed population, the sovereignty of a Polish State with the claims of non-Polish nationalities for a large measure of self- government. Besides, the incorporation of the whole of these territories would surely have added to tlle population of Poland a considerable number of actual Bolsheviks. But, in the author's view, there is already a slipshod sort of semi-Bolshevism in the constitution of Poland as it is: the Land Reform Bill dictated by the peasants, the demoralising bureau- cratism, the waning prestige of the educated class. Professor Zdziechowski has written very convincingly on the pernicious influence of Russian radicalism and the doctrinaire spirit on what</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS. 67I he calls the " possibilism " of Polish national mentality.' But, surely, his own early academic training in St. Petersburg has left a trace behind in his utter inability to value properly that arch- instrument of the art of politics-compromise. If he had himself been in the position of one of the rulers of the new Poland, or at least a member of the Constitutional Assembly, he would perhaps have realised how completely impossible it was for Poland to have any but the most radically democratic constitution and legislation- whatever were the dangers of demoralising effect or prematureness- just because the neighbourhood of a Communist Russia forbade any risk of provoking discontent among the masses. Maxim Gorky warned Europe that if she did not enter into relations with Soviet Russia, she would drive that country into the embrace of Asia. The Russo-Kemalist alliance and the baneful Soviet propaganda among Asiatic nations, have since made the truth of his words manifest. On the other hand, the reaction against the passiveness of Europe in view of Soviet horrors has produced a different strain of Asiatic sympathies in the minds of Russian emigrants. A new school of philosophic and political thought has arisen in Belgrade and elsewhere, which is now known by the name of Eurasianism, and is inspired by the leading idea that Russia's national character and her possible contribution to future world- civilisation cannot, in the average and conventional sense, conform to European standards, buit must be, like Russia herself, something midway between Europe and Asia. Professor Zdziechowski devotes a sympathetic chapter to this movement; in London, recently, a prominent member of the anti-Bolshevik Russian colony publicly professed his allegiance to ideas of this sort, at the year's inaugural meeting of the King's College Russia Society. No thoughtful student of the Russian mind can fail to be struck by the correctness of the uniderlying perception: to single out one instance only-who would deny that Tolstoy's morality is as near, to say the least, -to Indian philosoplhy as to the teachings of the New Testament? But it must be admitted that " Eurasianism," being so far only a call to intro- spection, addressed to the Russian nation, and shrinking anxiously from all idea of actual political flirtation with the nations of Asia:, is not as yet a developed programme of action, and hardly warrants the author's hope that an " Eurasian " Russia will be ready to grant to Poland, without dispute, her present Eastern frontier. Professor Zdziechowski's reflections on the present state of Europe culminate in a prediction of ruin for Western civilisation; and the Yellow Peril is to be the instrument of this ruin. In the course of a quarter of a centurv, the threat of the " Yellow Peril" has been too often repeated (and by such prophets as William II., too !), not to lose all its terror in the eyes of the average European by sheer force 1 In his Polish book on Russian Influences upon the Polish Soul (1920).</page><page sequence="7">672 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. of habit. The recent withdrawal of the Japanese from Siberia has certainly lessened the force of this idea still further, and only those, who have seen what Chinese soldiers of the Red Army are capable of, -may be expected to retain a vivid sense of the imminence of " the Yellow Peril." But even the present reviewer, who spent a year in -the extreme east of Siberia under Japanese occupation, must freely confess to the belief that-how shall we put it mildly ?-serious modifications of European civilisation under the coming American hegemony are a much more immediate contingency than the " Yellow Peril." The possible evolutions under American influence play their part in Professor Zdziechowski's vision, too: they come under the larger heading of " monstrosities of modern capitalism," as propheti- ,cally visualised before the war by that most witty and far-sighted Austro-Polish political philospher, W. Dzieduszycki-now displayed in the shameless profiteering enormities of post-war Europe, and re-born even in a Socialist Republic under the " new economic policy." But they recede into the background before the Yellow Monster, which has evidently fascinated the author's imagination. By this time, the reader has, no doubt, entirely lost patience with the reviewer. Since the latter, he will say, does not agree with the author either on first principles or on any question of practical politics, why should he single out the book for such elaborate notice at all ? 'The answer is, that it I am young enough not to accept the author's notion that doomsday is near for all of us, I am, on the other hand, old enough to believe with him that this post-war European world we live in is a moral pandemonium. And an appeal to conscience is most desirable, even if it does not come on the very eve of doomsday. It is on account of its high and noble moral inspiration that I think Professor Zdziechowski's book worthy of the notice of every civilised European. If more books of this type are written in different languages, the moral force which they breathe may permeate public opinion, and -in due time find its way into actual politics. Professor Zdziechowski -finds it compatible with " Romantic Pessimism " to hold Man capable of success in a determined struggle against recognised evil. I shall therefore end in his own spirit if-German-bred as I am-I express my own moral hopes for humanity in a stanza of Schiller's, which has often fired me with enthusiasm: Es ist kein leerer, schmeichelnder Wahn, Erzeugt im Gehirne des Toren; Im Herzen kuindet es laut sich an: Zu was Besserem sind wir geboren ! Und was die innere Stimme spricht, Das tauscht die hoffende Seele nicht. R. DYBOSKI. London, Christmas, I922.</page></plain_text>
