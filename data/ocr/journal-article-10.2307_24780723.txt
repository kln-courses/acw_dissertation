<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aquinas vs. Weber: Ideological Esthetics in The Great Gatsby PAUL GILES While the project of post-structuralism has been operating to undermine our belief in any ultimate point of origin capable of "explaining" literary texts, recent work on the ubiquity of ideology and the subtle ways in which ideological influences concretely affect modes of literary expression demonstrates that the cultural pressures which frame any given text continue to constitute an important field of enquiry. As Myra Jehlen has written recently: "the political categories of race, gender, and class enter into the formal making of American literature such that they underlie not only its themes, not only its characters and events, but its very language. The ideological dimension of literary works has emerged, therefore, as integral to their entire composition" (1). A particularly revealing example of how ideology palpably affects creative expression is The Great Gatsby (1926), in which the strangely "literal" symbolism of the novel and its ambivalent narrative mode may be traced to the way the inherited Roman Catholic analogical mindset of F. Scott Fitzgerald interacted with the materialist orientation of the American Dream in a climate in which the Church itself was debating whether the well-being of the Institution within the United States was best served through resistance to that Dream or cooperation with it. In his adult life, Fitzgerald was an apostate who came to despise what he thought of as the piety and bigotry of the Irish he had come into contact with during his Catholic upbringing in St. Paul, Minnesota. The question of religious "belief," however, need not detain us here. Whatever claims Catholicism may or may not Mosaic 22/4 0027-1276-89/010001 -12$01.50©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">2 Paul Giles have upon the notion of divine "truth," particular forms of religion—like any other social institution—can also be viewed as significant forces in a cultural and historical sense. The fact that religious systems ultimately value themselves in metaphysical rather than positivistic terms does not mean that they can exempt them selves from analysis of how their influence also operates, often in a circuitous or subliminal way, on this demystified and positivistic plane. It is true that The Great Gatsby lacks the explicit Catholic content of Fitzgerald's earlier works. We do not find here the medieval candlesticks cherished by Monsignor Darcy in This Side of Paradise (1920) nor the fascination with Renaissance Popes displayed by Anthony Patch in The Beautiful and Damned (1922). Nor is there any gesture so explicit as that "papal cross" by which the failed idealist Dick Diver "blessed the beach" on the penultimate page of Tender is the Night (1934). Yet Catholic ideology is "secularly" resonant in The Great Gatsby in two significant ways: first, in its contemplation of the power or powerlessness vested within symbolic metamor phoses of various kinds, and second in its inclination toward becoming a parody of the American Dream. Initially, moreover, The Great Gatsby did in fact begin with a strong "Catholic element," as Fitzgerald himself put it; before being re-written by Fitzgerald as an independent short story, the tale "Absolution" originally comprised the first chapter of Gatsby (Allen 103). In "Absolution," Jay Gatsby is revealed in his first incarnation as "Rudolph Miller," and this original opening chapter described how as a boy the hero chose to reject Christianity as a framework for his imaginative designs. "Absolution" depicts the rite of passage whereby Rudolph Miller is filled with "exultation" as he realizes that he will no longer put the "abstraction" of Catholic religious duties "before the necessities of his ease and pride" (87). Miller, like Gatsby after him, grows to feel that there must be "something ineffably gorgeous somewhere that had nothing to do with God" (91). The most obvious traces of Catholicism in the final published text of the novel are to be found in the way Gatsby's aspirations toward "something ineffably gorgeous" take the form of a spiritualization of earthly matter. The white purity of Gatsby's clothes is an emblem of his reluctance to soil his "immortal" love for Daisy Buchanan with the rude detritus of the terrestrial world: the clock, of course, has symbolically stopped when Gatsby encounters Daisy again at Nick Carraway's house. Gatsby carries with him an aura of transcendence as he moves within his landscape of "enchanted objects," as Carraway calls it ( 100), and one of the curious things about the novel is that this transcendence is not, finally, undermined by Gatsby's financial crim inality or by his neurotic insecurities and jealousies. In one of his typical stylistic paradoxes, Carraway oxymoronically contrasts Gatsby's worldly "corruption" with the hero's "incorruptible dream": "I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye" (160). In this way, as André Le Vot put it, "The corrupt means Gatsby uses to achieve his ends have not altered his fundamental integrity, his spiritual intactness" (144). This recognition of the ends as justifying the means is a familiar old Jesuit ploy,</page><page sequence="3">Ideology and Esthetics 3 and that sense of corruption and idealism being symbiotically entwined and rotating together upon the same axis may help to account for the sense of shifting perspectives which we are constantly experiencing in The Great Gatsby. To quote Le Vot again, "two modes, satiric and lyric, dominate the book"; Gatsby's follies are clearly exposed, but at the same time Carraway elevates Gatsby into trans figured splendor by those famous parallels with Columbus and the early settlers: to Nick, "Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock" (188) is comparable to that "transitory enchanted moment" when the Dutch sailors first became aware of the "fresh green breast of the new world" (187). The structural ambiguity introduced by this deployment of Carraway as a detached, ironic narrator clearly adds to our sense of a double perspective, so that the text consists of something like a series of Chinese boxes, an infinite spiral of ironic mirrors where nothing is allowed to stay undisturbed by its contrary and where no view of Gatsby himself can ever be considered a "final" one. All of this is familiar enough, of course. My argument, however, is that this ambivalence should be seen not just as a formalistic phenomenon, but also as a textual stress emanating from specific pressures which can be located within the context of a religious culture. One of the reasons for this chameleonic nature of Gatsby's representation lies in the text's double-edged attitude toward the appur tenances of the American Dream, an ambivalence which can be related to the uncertain social status of American Catholicism at a specific moment in history. The Great Gatsby is poised equivocally at the frontier of social conformity, being (like Carraway) "within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled" by the world it describes (42). This flirtation with the Janus-like form of parody, whereby the novel is lyric and satiric at one and the same time, can be seen as a parallel to the tensions within American Catholicism in the early decades of this century arising from the issue of "Americanization." At that time, theologians were debating whether the Church should maintain a sense of separation from mainstream American ideals, or whether it would be best served by moving toward assimilating itself within the dominant patterns of American cultural life. The arguments on both sides were intense and wide-ranging, and can be dealt with only in outline here. Essentially, clerics with more conservative or separatist tendencies (such as Archbishop John Hughes of New York and later Michael Corrigan, Bernard McQuaid and Anton Walburg) were staunch advocates of parochial education and other forms of dogmatic orthodoxy, and they feared that the integrity of the Church would become compromised by a too free and easy interaction with the secular optimism and commercial framework of the United States. Concurrently, however, more "liberal" prelates like James Gibbons and John Lancaster Spalding wanted American Catholicism to emerge out of the constrictive confines of its oppositional ghetto and to play a more central role in the development of American society. Gibbons and Spalding thought that the Church would never reach its full potential for growth in the United States if it remained locked into the role of a refuge for impoverished immigrants seeking escape from the pressures of harsh Protestant materialism. The liberals received a setback in 1899 when Pope Leo XIII's apostolic letter Testern benevolentiae discoursed on</page><page sequence="4">4 Paul Giles the errors of the American way of life and the need for strict adherence to the directives laid down by Rome, but this really served to slow down rather than to interrupt the processes of Catholic change in America.1 By reason of that ubiquity of ideological influence which Jehlen has noted, one can see these conflicts refracted in Fitzgerald's own life and art. He was himself by no means a ghetto child (there is a statue of Fitzgerald' s ancestor Francis Scott Key, author of "The Star-Spangled Banner," in the public square at Baltimore); neverthe less the fact that both his parents were practicing Catholics at a time when the institution of Catholicism was hovering uneasily on the margins of American society ensured that Scott was placed in an awkward relationship with his con frères. He wrote later in his Notebooks: "When I was young the boys in my street still thought that Catholics drilled in the cellar every night with the idea of making Pius the Ninth autocrat of the republic" (Allen 21). He further analyzed his sense of social insecurity in a 1933 letter to John O'Hara: "I am half black Irish and half old American stock with the usual exaggerated ancestral pretensions. The black Irish half of the family had the money and looked down upon the Maryland side of the family who had, and really had, that certain series of reticences and obligations that go under the poor old shattered word 'breeding' (modern form 'inhibitions'). So being born in that atmosphere of crack, wise-crack and countercrack I devel oped a two cylinder inferiority complex. So if I were elected King of Scotland tomorrow after graduating from Eton, Magdalene, the Guards with an embryonic history which tied me to the Plantagonets [sic], I would still be a parvenue" (Bruccoli 25). Thus Fitzgerald himself, while aspiring toward social conformity and accept ability, nevertheless finds himself in some ways irredeemably alienated. The more crucial point, however, is that these cultural tensions, of which Fitzgerald's own life offers a microcosm, substantially affect the implicit direction of his novels. In The Great Gatsby elements of Catholic assimilation combine with elements of Catholic alienation. It is the desire for assimilation which induces Jay Gatsby to compose his Hopalong Cassidy notebook in imitation of Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography: Gatz seeks to "Read one improving book or magazine per week" (180) and to follow an elaborate series of strenuous mental and physical exercises in the hope that this Franklinesque zeal will be the way to wealth, as indeed it duly turns out to be. In this sense, then, Gatsby acts out the American dream of upward social mobility. Yet it is the religious-oriented sense of alienation which deprives Gatsby of the Protestant spirit which underpinned Franklin's dedication to self improvement and the work-ethic: in The Great Gatsby any moral equation between the acquisition of wealth and inherent virtue is noticeably absent. In the first decade of this century, Max Weber established a famous parallel between the "Protestant ethic" and "the spirit of capitalism," suggesting how under Protestantism the making of money becomes an ethical imperative in itself and not simply a means toward a further end. Weber offered Franklin as a prime example of the secularization of this Protestant ethic, preserving a social and psychological impulse "without the religious basis, which by Franklin's time had died away" (180). Protestantism's emphasis on worldly zeal and energetic individuality was</page><page sequence="5">Ideology and Esthetics 5 contrasted by Weber with the more disdainful approach to terrestrial success epitomized by Thomas Aquinas, who declared himself in favor of work only for the maintenance of self and the community: "where this end is achieved," decreed Aquinas, "the precept ceases to have any meaning" (qtd. in Weber 159). In The Self-Made Man in America, Irvin G. Wyllie confirmed how this theological conception became a historical reality in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with Catholics forming a very small percentage of the American "business elite" and Catholic leaders "standing aloof from the glorification of wealth," choosing instead to uphold "their church's traditional indictment of materialism" (57). By the mid 1920s, as we have seen, circumstances had changed, and American Catholicism was no longer so much centered in immigrant ghettoes. Nevertheless, a note of estrangement continues to sound through The Great Gatsby. While Gatsby partially assimilates himself within the accepted idiom of material success, he himself places little value on that success except insofar as it enables him to become a more respectable suitor for Daisy; in addition, the ironic distance preserved by Carraway's detached, quizzical narrative further ensures that the reader never empathizes with Gatsby's social and economic success in the way we more readily empathize with the narrator's aspirations in Franklin's first-person Autobiography. Moreover, apart from a few mysterious telephone calls during his party, we never see exactly how Gatsby has made his pile. Whereas Franklin provides us with details of his successful accomplishments, Gatsby jumps straight from being a young soldier embarking for the war in Europe to his status as a Long Island magnate equipped with a vast number of "beautiful shirts" (99) and a state of-the-art orange squeezer. The novel, like Daisy's voice, is "full of money" (126), but it is bereft of the industry which produces money. As a result, the book enters an ambiguous cultural area; for, by celebrating American wealth but not the moral basis usually associated with the development of such wealth, The Great Gatsby veers toward becoming a parody of those traditional American narratives of economic success. Parody is a double-edged form, depending both upon implicit recognition of a model or archetype and also upon a sense of ironic dissociation from its assump tions—which is precisely what we find in Gatsby, where the outward emblems of social conformity are contradicted by the inner sense of psychological disjunction which Gatsby experiences. Unlike Weber's Lutherans and Calvinists, Gatsby sees no essential value in accumulating wealth for its own sake; for him, business-life is no more than a game or sport, a playful facade, like the extravagantly superficial re-creation within his Long Island mansion of Merton College Library, a perfect image of parody's doubling and duplicity, its strict observation of formal signifiers even as it radically voids itself of substantive signifieds. As Catholicism became increasingly Americanized, it began to play the games of society without believing in their ultimate spiritual significance (just as Gatsby's library contains books whose significant content is cancelled by their uncut pages). Thus the persistent irony in the novel can be read not just as a narrative and structural irony, but as irony embedded within a particular form of cultural process.</page><page sequence="6">6 Paul Giles The religious context of The Great Gatsby, then, helps to account for its oblique stance toward the American business world. In 1957, the Jesuit scholar Walter J. Ong wrote that the American Catholic mentality was gradually developing away from its oppositional status and beginning to celebrate the mass consumer markets of the United States, idealizing the Reader's Digest and Coca Cola advertisements as if in recognition that Catholicism is "a tradition capable of penetrating indifferently all cultures, and, indeed, designed by God to do precisely this" (2). Something of this same sensibility is anticipated in The Great Gatsby, which invests Gatsby's yellow Rolls-Royce and motor-boats and gorgeous buffet tables with an aura which is vaguely metaphysical. The parodie element persists, though, precisely because it is a consumer culture which is being sanctified, rather than traditional Puritan ideas of thrift and production. Fitzgerald eulogizes the spending, not the getting, of money. In this way, Fitzgerald's famous comment in "The Crack-Up" on how "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function" (39) could be applied to Gatsby's own ambiguous situation between the pressures of assimilation and the pressures of alienation. It is this ambiguity which leads the novel toward that dualistic form of parody whereby the text itself is "within and without," situated equivocally on the borders of social conformity. Gatsby himself is not exactly an upright Hopalong Cassidy hero, but neither is he simply a Prohibition-era criminal. Carraway's complex, bifurcated narrative denies us the security of any one perspective on the hero, and this formal ambivalence can be related, in part at least, to Fitzgerald's Catholic inheritance, which renders him unable to accept the nostrums of American social life without maintaining his sly distance from them. Parody is also a form of dualism which presupposes a difference between the objective signification and its subjective re-creation; and this cultural dualism integral to Fitzgerald's Catholic discourse can be seen to exist alongside (and in parallel to) the various linguistic dualisms and series of differences which arise in the novel. The Great Gatsby's meditation upon the power of analogy, metaphor and metamorphosis is also a disquisition upon the Catholic theme of transubstan tiation: can the timeless come into contact with time, can the icons be transformed into real flesh, or are they doomed to remain simply icons? In a transformed version of Catholic idolatry, Gatsby worships Daisy's image with what the narrator calls "unwavering devotion" (116): he hoards newspaper clippings about her (101) and re-invents her character to fit with the "creative passion" of his "dreams" (103). Gatsby's quandary, however, is that he can never be certain that his adoration will be repaid with an appropriate response from Mrs. Tom Buchanan. We see a prime example of this ambivalence at the end of Chapter 6, after Carraway has re-introduced Gatsby to Daisy: "His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete" (118). The</page><page sequence="7">Ideology and Esthetics 7 religious connotations here are self-evident. Gatsby's aspirations toward transcen dent divinity ("the mind of God") seem in one way to be compromised by Daisy's appearance as a real live human being, whose "perishable breath" betokens mutability and mortality. Still, the word "incarnation" has obvious Christian overtones, as if Daisy, like Christ, might be a God made flesh who does not necessarily forfeit her divine status by manifesting herself in a human guise. Again, Carraway's narrative preserves its double-edged, elusive quality: the beginning of this paragraph implies that the collapse of Gatsby's dream is im minent, but the end of the paragraph suggests that its embodiment is "complete." Also noticeable here is the use of the word "vision" to describe Gatsby's rapture. The visionary aspects of Gatsby's "religious" enterprise are interpreted to the reader through the frequent use of visual images and symbols, which play a very prominent role in the novel: the advertising hoarding of Dr. Eckleburg's eyes, the color symbolism of Gatsby's "blue lawn," the "green light at the end of Daisy's dock" (188), and so on. Indeed, Le Vot's researches have shown that in the early manuscripts Gatsby was even more heavily laden with symbolism, and that concessions to verisimilitude came at a relatively late stage of composition (148). Actually, however, in the final text it is the continual transmutation of realism into symbolism, the circular interplay between Daisy and the green light (for example), which functions as a corollary to that sense of evanescence which is one of Fitzgerald's main themes in the novel. The perpetual dialogue between realism and symbolism, between physical and "metaphysical," ensures that, for the reader as well as for the narrator, objects in the text come to seem "inessential" and begin to "melt away" before our eyes. Just as at the end of the novel Long Island metamorphoses itself for Carraway into the "fresh green breast of the new world.. .that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes" (187), just as Gatsby throughout the novel seeks to cancel the past and metamorphose Daisy Buchanan into the Daisy Fay redolent of Malory's Arthurian legend, so Fitzgerald's archetypal images cause the world under scrutiny to slide, to become dislocated, to metamorphose itself into a phantasmagoric hall of mirrors whose meaning is something other than a literal representation of the material world. In turn, this process of dematerialization becomes an analogue to that elegiac sense of loss which Fitzgerald is writing about: the use of symbolism causes the scene to evaporate in the same way as the passing of time brings about the final evaporation of Gatsby's grand design. Such evaporation occurs ultimately because of a gap between object and symbol which comes to prove irredeemable. If Daisy Fay could remain a fairy-tale enchantress like Morgan le Fay—her punning distant relation in Morte d'Arthur—Gatsby's dream would remain inviolable; his problem comes when he must actually kiss Daisy's flesh and bring their relation ship into the terrestrial world. When Gatsby actually makes his move with Daisy, he exposes himself to all the vulgar muddle, jealousy and accident which even tually bring about his demise, although it is his grandeur, in Carraway's eyes, that he never in fact renounces belief in "the colossal vitality of his illusion" (103). Nevertheless, concludes Carraway, Gatsby must have felt that he had "paid a high price for living too long with a single dream" (168). Daisy refuses to become</page><page sequence="8">8 Paul Giles transubstantiated into the golden princess of legend; she obdurately remains the self-interested and self-preserving wife of Tom Buchanan. The worldly object cannot become correlated with the divine symbolism which Gatsby attempts to impose upon it, and so the world lapses like the summer into casual mutability with "that obliging and indifferent sea" (184) sweeping all its worldly refuse away. Throughout the text we find a range of metaphors postulating the metamorphosis of the fallen world into a more sublime model: Gatsby regards "the silver pepper of the stars" (27), Carraway talks about the "long white cake of apartment-houses" on 158th Street (34), and so on; but the novel also implicitly acknowledges that these transmutations are arbitrary and provisional rather than sanctioned by any valid form of idealism. There is a revealing instance of this in the first chapter, when Daisy says to Carraway: "I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn't he?" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: "An absolute rose?" This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. (21) Carraway's disillusioning mind holds in check those equivalences and analogies which the other characters are intent upon fabricating. This is not to deny that Carraway himself indulges in these linguistic games from time to time, but he generally recognizes them as purely fictional constructions: the structural irony of his narrative role ensures Carraway's distance from the more extravagant phan tasms of Gatsby's imagination. Carraway knows that he is not a rose, that there is an irreparable difference between the analogical pretensions of the signifier and the mundane reality of the signified; moreover, especially toward the end of the novel, the text of Gatsby is haunted by a sense of the vacancy surrounding the icons it has established. In philosophical terms, analogy is often viewed through the derogatory lens of tough-minded skepticism, following Francis Bacon's seventeenth-century assumption that similitude is a charming fantasy which has not yet attained the age of reason. The notion of analogy is, however, crucial to Catholicism in a theo logical sense. As Peter Berger has pointed out, the Catholic doctrine of analogica ends, with its insistence upon conceptual links between heaven and earth, reveals itself through the elaborate networks of intercession which bind the Catholic faithful to an invisible world through emphasis upon such mediating forces as saints, departed souls, transubstantiation. We need to proceed carefully at this point, for it might with some plausibility be argued that analogy is not a specific ally Catholic phenomenon; to a Puritan seventeenth-century divine like Edward Taylor the natural world provides analogies and evidences of God's order which are all around and simply waiting to be discovered by the poet, and Jonathan Edwards and Ralph Waldo Emerson likewise envision nature as a system of elaborately-organized analogies. A crucial distinction must be made here, however. Puritan typologies tended to involve a strict reliance upon literal biblical hermeneutics. It was essential, said Samuel Mather in 1683, that religious interpreters find a close correlation between</page><page sequence="9">Ideology and Esthetics 9 worldly event and biblical prototype, and not go gadding about inventing far fetched allegorical or anagogical or tropological meanings: "But for men to set their Fancies a Work to extract Allegories out of every Scripture-history, as the Popish Interpreters use to do, is not safe nor becoming a judicious Interpreter. Luther called such Allegories Spumam Scripturae, they beat the Scripture into Froth by allegorizing all things" (qtd. in Rowe 8-9). Thus the Puritan type becomes a way of envisioning natural phenomena as the direct products, as seen through a glass darkly, of a higher transcendent world. The Catholic allegory, in contrast, finds no such firm correlation, but instead uses its worldly experience and imagination so as to conceive of links between earth and heaven. It is for these reasons that Puritan sensibilities have generally viewed the idea of metaphor with the gravest suspicion, as something like a literary equivalent of the metamorphosis inherent in transubstantiation. In his poem "Meditation 22 (First Series)," Edward Taylor found it a cause for self-congratulation that his "quaintest metaphors are ragged stuff / Making the sun seem like a mullipuffsimilarly, in his influential treatise of 1649 The Saints' Everlasting Rest, Richard Baxter summarized the Puritan hostility toward anthropomorphic allegory: But what is my scope in all this? is it that we might think Heaven to be made of Gold and Pearl? or that we should picture Christ, as the Papists do, in such a shape? or that we should think Saints and Angels do indeed eat and drink? No, not that we should take the Spirit's figurative expression to be meant according to strict propriety: or have fleshy conceivings of spiritual things, so as to believe them to be such indeed: But this; to think that to conceive or speak of them in strict propriety, is utterly beyond our reach and capacity: and therefore we must conceive of them as we are able. (qtd. in Daly 156-57) For Baxter, then, allegory of this kind was a regrettable pragmatic necessity not to be confused with ultimate truth, because unlike the Puritan type it was validated by no clear metaphysical authority. Emerson in the nineteenth century secularizes that typology by replacing the Christian God with a Neoplatonic ideal and apprehending earthly nature as its fallen fragments which might be holistically re-unified by an act of human heroism. As Sacvan Bercovitch remarked in an illuminating aside: "it was in the Puritan image that Emerson... cast his great essay on Nature (1836)—though not explicitly, of course" (158). We can, therefore, see how Emerson transforms Puritanism into an implicit secular philosophy, just as in the next century Fitzgerald was to transform and secularize the impulses of Catholicism. In "Protestant" literature the notion of a miraculous series of inter actions between secular and divine spheres has always seemed quite impossible. Indeed the theologian Paul Tillich defined "the Protestant principle" as a rigid refusal to absolutize things worldly and finite, and as an insistence instead "that the sacred sphere is not nearer to the ultimate than the secular sphere; both are infinitely distant from and infinitely near the Divine" (47). In "Catholic" writing, however, there has often been an emphasis upon some form of transubstantiation between material and metaphysical (or quasi-metaphys ical) planes. Gerard Manley Hopkins's technique of "inscape" is one modem example</page><page sequence="10">10 Paul Giles of this, and the idea also occurs within the secularized form of Joyce's "epiph anies," which derive ultimately from Thomas Aquinas's apprehension of how commonest objects might become radiant. Aquinas's Scholastic philosophy held that common earthly material participates in God's grace through the bonds of analogy which bring about a continuous interpénétration between human and divine worlds. Aquinas considered that every historical existence simultaneously participates in primary spiritual essence, so that "being is one in all by analogy" (44) because each part of God's creation embodies a "dynamic tendency towards the Absolute" (36). The Catholic sociologist Andrew Greeley has claimed that the "anthropology" of this "analogical imagination" works its way so deeply into a Catholic person's consciousness that it comes to be taken "for granted, and it rarely occurs to us that others totally disagree with it, do not find it as reasonable, as plausible, and as self-evident as we do" (65). However that may be, it is just this analogical imagination which fires the mind of Gatsby in his attempts to transub stantiate Daisy and defy the limitations of linear history by mingling her worldly existence with a timeless essence. In his blithe assumption that it is possible to "repeat the past" (117), Gatsby seeks to redeem the accident of Daisy's time on earth by infusing her with a "spiritual" substance which epitomizes a higher, "divine" grace. This is not to say that Gatsby "believes" in God, any more than Fitzgerald himself did. Nor, of course, does The Great Gatsby accept this doctrine of analogical transubstantiation at face value but rather—through the narrative of Carraway—skeptically interrogates the power of analogy, playing it off against the demystifying forces of deconstruction and difference. Nevertheless, it is a Catholic framework which provides one of the crucial terrains upon which this conflict of belief and skepticism works itself out, and to ignore the submerged religious context of the novel is not simply to miss a few abstruse theological refinements but the cultural base of the text itself. Writing can be substantially affected by other than self-evidently substantial things, and the intangible forms of religious apostasy provide part of the cultural matrix from which Fitzgerald's fiction emerges. This is not, of course, to echo the regrettably partisan and reclamatory approach too often mooted in any discussion of Fitzgerald's Catholicism. The Jesuit Harold Gardiner, to take one example, wrote in 1951 that the "real reasons" for Fitz gerald's "rootlessness" lay in his abandonment of the One True Faith (8). Gardiner's convictions about "real reasons" may strike us as less than fully convincing, not least because a wide-ranging and amorphous sense of "rootlessness" was part of the experience of that entire 1920s generation. To reiterate, it is not my intention here to offer Fitzgerald's Catholicism as any kind of monolithic explanation for the tensions and complexities of his work. What we can say, though, is that the implicit discourse of Catholicism produces cultural undercurrents which pull his text in directions it might not otherwise have taken: toward forms of transcendence; toward a parodie oscillation between the pressures of social assimilation and ironic alienation; toward images of idolatrous analogy which in the end find themselves stranded without metaphysical guarantees. It is also important to recognize that although these tendencies are more overt in Fitzgerald's early fiction, they do</page><page sequence="11">Ideology and Esthetics 11 linger in unexpected and subterranean ways within his later work. If the art of Fitzgerald's contemporary, Ernest Hemingway, was one of personal "grace under pressure," so in a wider conceptual sense might this phrase apply to the dynamics of The Great Gatsby.
