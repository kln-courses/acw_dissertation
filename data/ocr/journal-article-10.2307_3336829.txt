<plain_text><page sequence="1">~~~~*1 ~ ~ ~ 1 r~ .. '- V i- -.- The Yungur of northeastern Nigeria make anthropomorphic ceramic vessels, called wiiso, to contain ancestral spirits (Cover). That each is intentional- ly modeled to contain the spirit of a once-living male Yungur leader or of a man eligible to have become one broad- ly qualifies wiiso to be called "portraits" according to one definition offered here by Jean Borgatti (p. 35). How these fired clay pots serve as "likenesses" of Yungur people will be explored not only in terms of their representation of and "resemblance" to their subjects, but also in terms of the ways these pots-as ancestors-help structure and legit- imize social relationships. For the Yungur, the reality of their ancestors is inseparable from the reality of the ceramic symbols in which they dwell and with which they become inextrica- bly linked. Wiiso are more than individ- ualized depictions or passive images "standing in" for their subjects (Brilliant 1987). The meanings wiiso carry are tied to their active role in constructing and maintaining the world in which the Yungur live. These meanings reside in their form and in the complex frame- work in which they are made and used, a framework encompassing structurally related contexts where material symbols are actively used to reinforce social pro- cesses and strategies.

BERNS. separation, all Yungur speak the same Adamawa language (Benue-Congo) and share general social, cultural, and eco- nomic patterns.' They live in dispersed villages largely concentrated in three main localities: Diterra, Suktu, and Waltandi.2 Each of these localities is gov- erned by a chief, or gubo (pl., gubsa), whose primary obligation is to maintain the religious cults on which the survival of his constituency depends. Because a gubo's duties are largely restricted to such sacred or ritual matters, secular tasks are delegated to his deputies, called pagubsa (sing., pagubo; Fig. 3). Within each locality are villages or clus- ters of hamlets generally consisting of extended patrilineal families or kindreds that are strictly exogamous.3 The head- man of each kindred, called an ed handa, belongs to a "council" responsible for the local population's secular and sacred well-being. A gubo is only its titular head. His deputies hold senior rank on the council relative to the headmen's junior status. The deputies also are responsible for nominating and installing the new gubo, although they usually do so in consultation with the governing council. (The final choice of chief, however, is always verified through a process of divination.) The individuals who fill these leadership positions are selected from particular patrilineages recognized by each Yungur locality. It is they who become wiiso. Every Yungur hamlet has one or more shrine enclosures, called~ xidwiiso, "rooms for wiiso." Their number and internal composition are structured according to the system of political and religious organization outlined above. The wiiso kept in shrines contain the spirits of deceased chiefs and headmen or of amwapa, male members of eligible lineages who did not attain office. There are several xidwiiso in major ritual precincts, generally isolated in rocky citadels within the Yungur landscape. The largest Yungur shrine center, con- sisting of seven discrete enclosures, is situated in a glen on the hill of Diterra. The gubo of Diterra is nominally regard- ed as the spiritual head of all Yungur, partly because the greatest number of hamlets are under his jurisdiction and because he oversees the largest and most powerful shrine complex.4 Four xidwiiso house the vessels containing the spirits of chiefly ancestors-two for past Diterra gubsa (one each for mem- bers of the Laro and Dirma families from which gubsa are selected) and two for deceased amwapa. In addition, two other shrines, called xiddute ("rooms for skulls"), house the skulls exhumed from the burials of Diterra gubsa. A fifth shrine, called a xitkpana, contains the iron regalia associated with war and hunting. The sixth and seventh shrines, considered the most powerful, are the ditguno ("important shrine") and the xidwiisoguno ("major room for wiiso"; Fig. 2). They contain the key ritual items, including wiiso, brought by the Yungur from Mukan, a hill located to the north, which they regard as their sacred homeland.5 These shrine complexes provide a locus for the structuring of relationships between the Yungur and their ancestors. Physically separate from most residen- tial areas, they demarcate the spaces in which people make contact with spirits and, more specifically, in which certain men exercise their authority to mediate on behalf of their extended kin group. As a measure of his religious power, the Diterra gubo lives with his family in a compound adjacent to the sacred precinct he oversees, and he is discour- aged from ever leaving its immediate vicinity. His proximity to the sacred shrines makes him dangerous, and it explains, in part, why external secular matters are delegated to his pagubsa, who in turn are empowered by their exclusive association with him. The ancestors, to whom chiefs and headmen directly appeal, are consid- ered custodians of the Yungur social order, responsible for their descendants' health and prosperity. They, in turn, appeal to the main creator god, Leura, 3. PAGUBSA, ASSISTANTS TO THE CHIEF, OR GUBO (PL., GUBSA), OF DITERRA. MAY 1981. 2.

The poten- tial effective power of the ancestors is based on the belief that when old peo- ple die, especially male leaders, their spirits join the cosmological realm of Leura. Reaching old age is a reward for behaving appropriately and for having a good character during life. Hence, those men who achieve elder status, who hold or are eligible to hold posi- tions of social and ritual authority, and who play a role in assuring the health and well-being of their relatives-like a gubo, an ed handa, and amwapa-are the most effective guarantors of their descendants' prosperity even after death. The closeness of these elite male ancestral spirits to the supreme Yungur creator god and to other important deities, such as those controlling rain- fall, makes them conduits through which the living-who belong to the same patrilineages-appeal for benefi- cent supernatural assistance. The authority of male Yungur lead- ers depends on their maintaining links to their predecessors. Each succession of leaders has accrued power over the generations, and ultimately can be traced to the first priests who lived at the historical site of Mukan. The accu- mulation of wiiso pots in shrines materi- ally reproduces this historical process and provides current leaders with a means for contacting this intergenera- tional network (Fig. 4). The exclusive manipulation of wiiso by their custodi- ans is part of the strategy by which cer- tain lineages maintain control over their constituencies (see Hodder 1982a:85). Furthermore, all wiiso, and especially those said to have been originally brought from Mukan (see Fig. 12), serve as mnemonic devices reminding pres- ent-day Yungur leaders both of their legacy and of their responsibility and power to affirm and maintain the social order. As I have indicated, there is a clear linkage between the ideas held about ancestors and the human-made ceramic 6.

It is largely Yungur women who make the fired clay wiiso, along with a range of domestic and ritual ceramic wares (see Berns 1986:259-61). Data collected in the field from some male lineage elders did indi- cate, however, that some of the artists who produce these ancestral pots are men.6 That women generally model wiiso, even if they may not manipulate them once they are enshrined, makes them a part of the process by which these vessels take on meaning in Yungur society. Thus, women, who are often overlooked for their contribution to the system of relationships that occur between people and spirits, are not sim- ply "making" the pots. They are partici- pating in the production of material symbols and in the ways these symbols support and help negotiate Yungur social and ideological relationships (see Hodder 1982a; Tilley 1989).7 Producing wiiso can be read as acts of creation echoing the work of Leura, the Yungur creator god, who "makes" people. It is from spirits contained in wiiso that Leura is said to bring new life. For individuals to be reborn, ances- tral spirits must be available to Leura, and portrait pots enshrine them for this purpose. While the wiiso discussed here only involve certain elite male spirits, small wiiso (sometimes called bingra) are made to contain and appeal to the spirits of all other elderly men and women who have died. The production of these pots and the process of reincarnation through Leura may be symbolically linked to the birth of Yungur children. The nexus of these related activities resides with women, who as producers of wiiso facilitate the transformation of the dead into spirits and back again into people, and who as mothers physically perpetuate and increase lineages. Leura may be female, despite Meek's claim that this deity is regarded by the Yungur as male (1931, vol. 2:455). Because he describes Leura (or Edgunda) as "the potter, the fash- ioner of men and all living things," and given the dominant role of women as potters today, Meek's early observa- tions and the assumptions on which they were based should be re-examined and verified. What seems uncontroversial, howev- er, is that each wiiso is intentionally modeled to contain the spirit of a specif- ic ancestor, even if shrine chiefs and headmen today cannot always identify them by name. The visual vocabulary of wiiso establishes the fundamental link- age between people and spirits. This is evident in the pot's anthropomorphism, from the way the basic shape creates anatomical referents-head (near the mouth of the vessel), neck, and body -to the specific features modeled on the surface-arms that extend down the sides of the torso, navel, and sometimes genitalia (Fig. 6). While the remarkable diversity of facial features on wiiso seems to represent an effort to make each pot distinctive, it does not neces- sarily follow that such variation alone determines portraiture. As indicated above, artists may not be using it to capture the personal likenesses or idiosyncrasies of deceased Yungur chiefs. Nor should we assume that our Western definition of a portrait's rela- tionship to the portrayed determines a person-cum-ancestor's visual identity for the Yungur. Not having asked the Yungur how such pots work for them as ceramic representations of particular people, I have concluded, after analyz- ing several hundred wiiso extant in shrines, that individuation has to do with how certain sculptural elements are handled: the size of the pot, the ves- sel profile, the alignment of arms on the torso, the location of the face along the neck of the pot, the arrangement of fea- tures on the facial plane, and the posi- tion and elaboration of coiffure pat- terns. I would propose further not only that these details distinguish particular ancestors, but that certain clusters of traits identify those belonging to certain lineages and localities. The features con- stituting an ancestor's appearance are manipulated according to a prescribed sculptural code-rather than being driven by details of actual appear- ance-suggesting an awareness on the part of their makers and users of the impact of wiiso as objects on social or ideological processes. Generally speaking, the anthropo- morphic model on which wiiso are based allows the pots, like other forms of expressive culture, to communicate essential ideas about humanity-its vitality, social order, and values (see Blier 1987). The pot-person linkage has been discussed by Nicholas David, Judy Sterner, and Kodzo Gavua in their arti- cle "Why Pots are Decorated" (1988). They present an argument derived from field research in northern Cameroon among the Mafa and Bulahay, Chadic speakers whose social organization is based on an endogamous caste system where women are potters and their hus- bands are smiths. The women produce a 53 * r" - , r | ,- ? -W ? ;se s 4 !&gt; v'isb/</page><page sequence="5">range of decorated pottery including sacred vessels containing spirits, the most anthropomorphic of which is the Mafa god pot, called Zhikile (see David, Sterner, &amp; Gavua 1988: fig. 7). The deco- ration of Mafa pottery is analogous to the adornment of Mafa people, and the authors of the article argue that the way concepts about the body determine dec- orative systems makes pots into people (1988:365). This premise applies equally and even more explicitly to Yungur wiiso, whose formal features refer specif- ically to programs of Yungur self-deco- ration. David, Sterner, and Gavua pro- pose that "pots share with persons the characteristic of owing their existence to having been irreversibly transformed, by fire and by enculturation respective- ly..." (1988:366; see also Barley 1984). In the Yungur case, this proposition can be extended to include several irreversible body modifications associated with enculturation-scarification, tooth chip- ping, and ear piercing-which wiiso share with people (Figs. 1, 5-7). These permanent physical transfor- mations were carried out before the completion of Xono, an initiation ordeal held every sixteen or twenty-four years in each Yungur locality.8 The fact that boys went through them reflects the importance of the transition to adult sta- tus and the shared acceptance of certain social responsibilities and obligations. It is not accidental that the body modifica- tions signaling an irreversible commit- ment to Yungur society are rendered on wiiso. It would be natural to assume that in death, as in life, such male ancestral spirits would retain their markers of manhood and look like the Yungur elders they once were. Yet, such features also may serve as mechanisms of con- trol, making sure Yungur men in anoth- er irreversible life cycle-transition maintain a commitment to positive social action, as they did earlier when they became adults.9 Thus, ceramic por- traits do more than sustain a visual link between the men who died and their spirit incarnations. These formal fea- tures mark and help control encounters between people and their ancestors (see Braithwaite 1982), an endeavor whose success sustains both collective well- being and the social dominance of par- ticular men and lineages. The stylistic principles governing the production of wiiso therefore can be said to exist at the macrolevel (shared ele- ments of decoration expressing collec- tive identity and ethnicity) and at the microlevel (differing elements of decora- tion expressing personal identity and kinship relationships). The wiiso of ancestors belonging to particular locali- ties, clans, or lineages vary accordingly, and their differences support the social, political, and religious decentralization of the Yungur. For example, wiiso range widely in size, from the smallest, 10-20 centimeters high (mostly found in Waltandi, where they represent de- ceased village heads; Fig. 7), to the largest, 65-95 centimeters high (mostly found in larger shrine precincts, where they represent chiefs or amwapa; Fig. 8). A comparison of two wiiso groupings, one from the Dombi lineage of the Dirma clan in Diterra (Fig. 9) and the other from the Sago lineage of the Laro clan in Diterra (Fig. 10), reveals how style works to distinguish levels of iden- tity: in Dombi, wiiso have faces with large cup-shaped ears modeled low on the neck near the body of the pot, which frequently has round, pierced projec- tions; in Sago, wiiso have faces framed by impressed ridges modeled high on elongated necks. The formal features shared respectively by Dombi and Sago pots artistically reinforce familial links between generations of successive head- men represented by these pots. Given actual genetically based "family resem- blances" it is not surprising that wiiso would likewise share physical character- istics. That, additionally, all wiiso are enculturated Yungur is evident in the pierced ears or chipped teeth associated with adult status. Yet, despite what these artistic affinities suggest about lev- els of collective and personal identity, they alone do not determine how wiiso are or become individual portraits. These groups of Diterra wiiso are very different from the distinctively small examples from hamlet shrines in Waltandi, which tend to have very sim- ple contours and rudimentary facial fea- tures modeled on the neck near the mouth opening (Fig. 7). One shrine (Fig. 11) maintained by the Gumba family (Vorro clan, Waltandi) contains pots rep- resenting five generations of headmen, who are remembered by personal name: Umbelandan, Ownbwelowandania, Bwota, Owbwota, Bwansareh. As is true of the wiiso described above, size and certain consistent stylistic features dis- tinguish one patrilineal unit from anoth- er at the same time that scarification patterns around the navel or chipped teeth reinforce shared ethnic, social, and gender identities. Moreover, the stylistic variation evident in each wiiso, however slight, supports the point made earlier that the way sculptural details are han- dled individualizes wiiso. One category of wiiso is distinctive from those presented thus far because of the pots' size (approximately 70-95 cm 8. WIISO FOR THE SPIRIT OF A MAN WHO WAS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME GUBO. DITERRA, 62cm.

In fact, quite unlike the strikingly diverse wiiso described above, pots belonging to this group are distinct- ly conventionalized and recur in the largest shrine precincts of Diterra and Waltandi. Current chiefs trace this pot type to the Mandara Mountains along the Nigeria-Cameroon border, from which the Yungur say they migrated to Mukan, their sacred homeland. These pots were then brought to the present Yungur area where they contain and actualize the original power and pres- ence of Mukan and pre-Mukan chiefs. These early ancestors established the link to supernatural forces governing survival, including Leura and other deities, particularly those overseeing rainfall. What stylistically distinguishes this wiiso configuration is evidence of an underlying facial structure and a more fully rounded head. Facial features are restrained-slit-like eyes and mouth- compared to the generally exaggerated physiognomy of most wiiso (cf. Fig. 1). Two other diagnostic features are a tri- angular-shaped beard and a tall crest surmounting the rounded forehead, which opens into a spout. The high rank of the former chiefs these pots incarnate is explicitly identified by the curved staff modeled over the arm or onto the torso; it represents the bent iron staff (salawa) gubsa carry during rainmaking rites (see also Fig. 8). 11.

In 1981 one of these "Mukan" vessels was half-buried at the entry to the ritual precinct at Diterra (Fig. 13). Named Tentire, it watches over the area and is capable of killing intruders. The gubo and pagubsa of Diterra explained to me that Tentire is the "wife" of a male pot buried nearby, hidden because of his troublesome character. There is clearly 10.

MAY 1981. significance to this gender distinction, and to the fact that current leaders see a female supernatural presence as having greater potential, in this context, to be protective. This is in direct contrast to the general absence of female ancestors in wiiso shrines, where it is largely male ancestors who are asked, at least today, for their beneficent intervention, a situa- tion that mirrors the actual dominance of men over women in the public domain. It remains notable, neverthe- less, that the exposed female Tentire is identical to male Mukan wiiso enshrined in the Diterra precinct she is guarding (cf. Fig. 12). This example, though unusual, challenges the assumption that wiiso and the ancestors they embody have always been male.10 Another wife-husband pair of wiiso is enshrined in the major ritual precinct in Waltandi (Cover), whose contents differ considerably from those of the hamlet shrines I have described (cf. Figs. 7, 11). This wiiso couple traveled on its own volition to the Waltandi hills from Mukan. The male conforms to the "Mukan" type; one pot representing his wife remains only as a head and neck fragment and has been supplemented by a second full wiiso, but neither of them duplicates the Mukan model as closely as does the male counterpart 55 I 'ron.-S ,# 4tdw, .4*1 .04W</page><page sequence="7">12.

This founding cluster is sur- rounded by a large agglomeration of broken head fragments collected from various abandoned hill shrines in the Waltandi area. Although this grouping of heads is distinctive because of its range of sculptural variation and care- fully executed details, it is like the Mukan prototype in that the heads have stylized but relatively naturalistic facial features and ridges of texture around the neck. Contributing to their realism is the position of the spout at the back of the vessel, allowing the head to be sculpted fully in the round. The com- plex plaited hairstyles typical of these wiiso are based on styles formerly restricted to men of high rank. It is unclear why these distinctively similar wiiso, commonly identified with Mukan, are enshrined in Diterra and Waltandi. We know very little about how or why the present-day Yungur came to move from their ascribed sacred homeland of Mukan or even where Mukan was actually situated in the Ga'anda Hills to the north."l Never- theless, by associating these vessels with Mukan and its original chiefs, current Yungur leaders have sanctioned the effi- cacy and power of their largest shrine complexes, as well as legitimized their own authority to oversee them. While today many wiiso are exposed in such shrine areas, they formerly were largely invisible behind their shrine enclosures. Judy Sterner has aptly observed that it is often pots like these, "highly charged with meaning," that are the least visible of a group's ceramic production (1989:451-53). And, para- doxically, these are the pots that tend to be the most elaborately decorated, which is certainly true of Yungur por- trait wiiso. Complex symbolic messages are being sent in this case, as in the Bulahay example from northern Cam- eroon described by Sterner (1989:458), to the pots' makers and users (i.e., female [and sometimes male] potters and male priests) and to the spirits themselves. Yet, the pots are doing more than "sig- naling" via an elaborate decorative schema. Their very material pres- ence-defined by this prescribed sculp- tural code-affirms and engages the participation of ancestors and their liv- ing descendants in a set of ritual activi- ties that essentially exist to assert social solidarity (Tilley 1989:188). Wiiso are not incidental to this ritual process; they are necessary and meaningful components of it. The ancestors via their wiiso are regu- larly contacted during Mama, the annu- al pre-planting festival when chiefs and headmen make special appeals on behalf of their communities for suffi- cient rainfall and good harvests. Mama is enacted at each shrine, although more elaborate rites are undertaken at main ritual precincts, such as Diterra, where there are more shrines (and hence, more pots and ancestors) to propitiate. Cen- tral to Mama is brewing beer that will be shared by the ancestors and their living relatives. In some localities, such as Diterra, sprouted guinea corn (out of which the beer is made) is distributed to all hamlet shrine custodians. From this "starter" ingredient, beer is brewed and then deposited in gourds within every shrine and sprinkled over the wiiso pots. Once propitiated, the ancestors often are invoked by reciting their names. This act of naming helps define the specific por- trait identity of the wiiso and makes per- sonal the appeals made by living leaders. Afterward the beer that has remained in the shrine for three days is shared by its chief-custodians. Drinking beer together, especially when it is made from the same ingredients, reinforces social ties between members of the male politico-ritual bureaucracy who together oversee Yungur well-being. Drinking beer that has been inside xidwiiso includes the ancestors in this fraternity and encourages them to satisfy the requests of their descendants. Thus, this annual ritual assures the community that efforts have been made to secure 13. ANCESTRAL POT CALLED TENTIRE AT THE ENTRY l TO THE RITUAL PRECINCT IN DITERRA.

And, because communities depend on their chiefs and headmen for enacting Mama before planting can begin, these male leaders maintain considerable control over their constituencies' farming sched- ules and future harvests. Wiiso remind Yungur leaders not only of their influence over the lives of their descendants but also of those reali- ties they know must be brought under control, like rainfall (see Davis 1984:22). Nevertheless, despite their actions at Mama, the rains may be late or inade- quate, so Yungur chiefs maintain special places where secondary appeals can be made. In Suktu, for example, a large storage pot (89 cm) is kept on a hillside overlooking the place where the main xidwiiso precinct is situated. The gubo and pagubsa of Suktu will gather in front of this pot and use it to divine why the rain has not fallen. All the names of amwapa are called out. When the pot provides a sign indicating which of these elite male ancestors is holding back the rain, the gubo and his assistants go to the shrine and remove that ances- tor's wiiso. Appeals are made and beer is offered in an effort to convince that amwapa to release the rain. A similar process is undertaken at Diterra, where the gubo and his assis- tants gather at an oracle (a cleared area ringed with stones) to determine which past chief is responsible for a drought. The culpable ancestor's wiiso is remov- ed from the shrine and brought to the oracle, where beer is poured over it. It will be kept at this site until rain falls. In special cases, a cow or ram may be sacrificed. While the efforts of leaders may fail despite annual Mama rituals, the power of wiiso to facilitate solutions by which people can overcome otherwise unpre- dictable circumstances remains constant (and predictable). Negotiations over rainfall further validate the proposition made earlier that the identity and pres- ence of the ancestors are inextricably bound to the ceramic vessels in which they reside. That individual wiiso are portraits of specific chiefs or headmen who have died is reinforced by rituals aimed at identifying and naming which individual male ancestor is responsible for a drought or other catastrophe pre- venting a good harvest. The process by which a deceased Yungur person is transformed into an ancestor helps construct the pot-person linkage implicit in wiiso. All Yungur men and women are buried immediate- ly after death, wrapped in cloth or robes. The skulls of those who reached advanced age are removed from graves and preserved, often in caves. The burial of a gubo or ed handa is distinctive; the corpse is placed in a squatting position inside a large storage pot (to) half-buried in the ground and covered by a similar vessel. A rope is tied around the corpse's neck with one end threaded through a hole in the wall of the pot. The rope can then be tested at intervals marked by ceremonial beer drinking, until the head falls. In Waltandi a num- ber of iron hoe blades are tied around the neck of the corpse along with the string, so that when the head falls, it does so with an audible clatter (Meek 1931, vol. 2:439). Burying chiefs and priests with hoe blades, also done in Diterra though the blades are not tied around the corpse's neck, has other symbolic significance. The presence of these essential farming tools within the pot burial, as the deceased makes his transition to ancestral status, objectifies and ensures a continuing responsibility to promote agricultural fertility. The body is left buried with the hoe blades for at least a year. The skull is then removed to a xidwiiso within a sacred precinct, such as to the special shrine in Diterra (xiddute) reserved specifically for this purpose.12 At Mama festivals beer is offered to the ceramic portraits of the ancestors, and it is also consumed before the shrines where their skulls are kept; the skulls are removed and washed at this time. Thus, the essence of the ancestor's spirit is not only embodied in wiiso pots but is per- manently resident in the skull, a relic of the once-living person.13 What should be remembered here, however, is that a chief is buried within a ceramic tomb before his spirit is permanently embod- ied in another, helping to structure the pot-person connection.14 And the associ- ation with pottery, as well as with iron hoe blades, contains the reference to agriculture-the favorable conditions for which depend on the positive inter- vention of the ancestors. Commemorating and controlling the transition of the dead to the realm of the ancestors also occur at community post- burial rites called Wora. Wora is always held during the pre-planting months of March and April so that new ancestral spirits can assist in bringing a bountiful harvest. Wooden representations of deceased male or female elders, called kpanda, are displayed during Wora. Effigies for the non-elite were carved as simplified wooden "hooks" (see Meek 1931, vol. 2:441; Berns 1986:269, figs. 83-84), but this practice largely has been abandoned. A more anatomically differ- entiated figure was made to represent a deceased gubo or ed handa (see Chappel 1977: fig. 221c). Current Diterra leaders explained that the eldest son of the deceased would fashion the figure; unfortunately, in 1981 there was only one rudimentary example surviving.'5 According to Meek (1931, vol. 2:439-41), the sculptures of former "earth priests" were carved with "head, eyes, nose, body and legs" and were dressed in a cap, gown, and sandals for Wora. Community members saluted these fig- ures and then threw guinea corn over them, which Meek interprets as a way to affirm the gubo's responsibility for the harvest (1931, vol. 2:440), a responsibili- ty repeatedly reinforced symbolically through the objects, attributes, and activities involved in his transition to ancestral status. (Gifts of corn also may provide the deceased with food for the afterlife.) 57</page><page sequence="9">Following Wora, the wooden kpanda are stored in caves, where the skulls of chiefs are also sometimes kept. Thereafter, the spirits of ancestors are approached through their ceramic wiiso, which only their male descendants may manipulate and see. There are several life-sized wood sculptures attributed to the Mboi (Mboye), a Yungur subgroup, which may be related to the rather schematic kpanda (kpaniya in Mboi).16 The example in the Menil collection in Houston is the best preserved (Fig. 16); Leon Siroto describes it as an effigy of an "earth priest" (1976:11-12), based on the mate- rial quoted above from Meek (1931, vol. 2:439-40). There is no corroborating evi- dence to confirm a contextual or even stylistic relationship between these large, fully articulated so-called Mboye sculptures and the figurines extant among the Mboi (Fig. 15) or the Yungur. However, the head of the Menil figure does bear a striking stylistic resem- blance to the Mukan wiiso (cf. Fig. 12). This is evident in the contours of the face, especially from the side view (cf. Figs. 16 &amp; 13, 14), and the way certain features are sculpted, particularly the ears (as perforated disks), eyes, beard, and coiffure. Another Mboi figure, in the Baudouin de Grunne collection (Gillon 1984: fig. 92) shares these fea- tures and also has the same ridges of texture around the neck that are visible on wiiso. It is possible that the ceramic wiiso and the wood sculptures are both associated with the ancient site of Mukan. The Menil figure was carbon- dated to approximately A.D. 1470 ? 90 (Oerkunst van Zwart Africa 1977:59); no scientific tests have been done on the wiiso. The distribution of Adamawa lan- guages in the region makes it plausible that Yungur speakers have lived in the area for at least five hundred years, although there is no substantiating archaeological evidence. Yet, despite their dating, the relative rarity of figura- tive wood sculpture in this part of Nigeria makes these life-sized carvings difficult to accept unreservedly as "Mboye" or even Yungur.17 Never- theless, their uncanny resemblance to ceramic wiiso, which may or may not have gradually replaced the use of wood figures, cannot be ignored. (However, none of the Mboi wiiso, called wuxiisa, resemble the Yungur Mukan examples.) This discussion of funerary sculpture is not incidental to a discussion of wiiso portrait pots. How these pots work as "ancestors" within the pattern of propi- tiation annually enacted by priests can- not be disassociated from the process of "becoming ancestors." It is not just the form and decoration of wiiso that estab- 16. MBOI FIGURE, CA. 1470. WOOD WITH TRACES OF PIGMENT. 176.5cm. COURTESY OF THE MENIL COLLECTION, HOUSTON. 1?.. ,I G.W 15.

As Christopher Tilley has argued (1989:188), our study of material culture requires that we "go beneath the surface appearances to an underlying reality" and look to "rela- tionships between things" rather than only to the things themselves. Wiiso pots are part of a set of ritual transactions that establish the presence and power of past leaders as ancestors. And pivotal to this process is that the living chiefs who manipulate and control wiiso, thereby affirming their social power and domi- nance, later undergo the same process to become wiiso themselves. The destiny of Yungur chiefs to be spiritually immortalized in clay can be traced to their initial selection. The final 18. CERAMIC FINIAL IN WALTANDI.

Pottery figurines or heads that have bro- ken-off wiiso are used to represent these candidates (Fig. 17). The process of div- ination culminates with the selection of one figurine or head, and the person that ceramic head represents becomes the next gubo.18 That these heads, which once were ancestors, now serve as equivalents of their living descendants as amwapa sustains the irreducibility of the links between present and past lead- ers. It is not accidental that the ances- tors-embodied in wiiso-legitimate their successors. The houses and sometimes the xid- wiiso shrines of chiefs and village heads are distinguished by sculptural ceramic finials for thatch roofs, called bwelta, (sing., bwela), made by Yungur women (Fig. 18).19 Unlike wiiso, however, these sculptures, dramatically lashed to the tops of houses, are visible to everyone and speak to the community about the status and identity of those who live within them. Bwelta are elaborate con- structions, often incorporating clusters of stylized figurines modeled onto glob- ular bases, representing the constituency to which a chief (or his ancestors) is responsible. Beyond this level of sym- bolic meaning, bwelta as finials function structurally to secure the thatched roofs of these houses, while preventing rain from entering. Thus, they provide cru- cial protection for the house's residents, Yungur leaders (or their ancestors) whose activities and intervention are instrumental in bringing the rain itself. Supporting the idea that the protection bwelta provide is more than physical and their form more than decorative is the fact that during Mama rituals, they, like wiiso, are splashed with beer. Bwelta con- tinue to be used on the houses occupied by successive generations of chiefs until they break; the fragments are then placed on clearings in front of xidwiiso shrines where the souls of their ances- tors are kept (Figs. 19, 20). Thus, again like wiiso, bwelta are not restricted to one context of use and meaning. They move from roof tops, where they function as finials and carry certain symbolic mean- ings, to clearings on the ground (see Fig. 17), where as figurative fragments they are used, along with broken wiiso heads, in the process of selecting the next chief, whose house another bwela will mark and protect. The symbolic association between Yungur leadership and ceramic sculp- ture is maintained and reinforced from the moment of accession to office through the transformation from living to ancestral status. Wiiso, together with other related categories of material cul- ture (e.g., kpanda wood effigies and bwelta ceramic finials), legitimize the power of particular Yungur men. Thus, they support the argument voiced by art historians and archaeologists alike20 that material symbols are not simple or pas- sive reflections of the social practices they represent or communicate about. They "actively represent and act back upon society" (Hodder 1982b:10). This position allows a better understanding of "the meanings of things" (Hodder 1989). Wiiso, for example, materially and symbolically structure relations between people and spirits, between lineages and localities, and between certain men and their dependents-other men, women, and children. And these relationships are joined, not only through the produc- tion, physical presence, and stylistic par- ticulars of wiiso, but through the set of transformational processes whereby people assert their control over various ideological and social realities. That these pots are sculpted and fired by women, that their decorative programs relate to modes of social transformation and integration (from youth to adult and from adult to ancestor), that they culminate a series of irreducibly linked ritual activities through which the living become ancestors, and that their manip- ulation by certain men assures those men power and influence while reassur- ing the community of its potential for success in farming-all are crucial to the meanings of wiiso. The very range of wiiso types docu- mented across the Yungur area confirms the history and embeddedness of this sculptural tradition. How they differ from family to family or from genera- tion to generation shows that symbolic structures are continually renegotiated, as are the contexts of change, social and otherwise, that constitute their history (see Hodder 1982b). At the same time, the shared visual features of wiiso rein- force their role in preserving and expressing collective ideas about Yungur culture and society. Each wiiso is synonymous with the spirit of a once real person, and the specificity of the equivalence between pot and person is central to the way the Yungur think about their ancestors. Although wiiso could be classified as "portraits" using a borrowed Western art historical genre, I have argued here that to designate them merely as such neglects their complex meanings as active material and sym- bolic components of Yungur social prac- tice and history. D Notes, page 102 Author's note: Obviously, all of the wiiso illustrated in this article were in situ in 1981, when their photographs were taken. Since this postdates Nigerian antiquities laws and the 1970 articles of the UNESCO convention, Yungur vessels that have left Nigeria without signed certificates of non- antiquity may be subject to investigation. 20.

The Peoples of Southern Nigeria, vol. 1. London: Oxford University Press. BERNS: Notes, from page 60 This article is based on fieldwork accomplished in 1981, funded by Fulbright-Hays and the Social Science Research Council (see Bers 1989a:102). The ideas are drawn from a paper originally given in a panel on portraiture organized by Jean Borgatti for the 1986 Triennial Symposium on African Art in Los Angeles. I would like to thank Jean for inviting me to participate in this special issue. I am also grateful to Doran Ross for his insightful comments on an earlier version of this manuscript. I would like to dedicate this article to all the Yungur who so willingly and warmly shared their knowledge with me. My efforts can only repay a fraction of what they so generously gave, and what I say here represents my best attempt to inter- pret and communicate the meanings of their arts and culture. 1. Although Yungur is the designation used in classifications of Nigerian languages (e.g., Greenberg 1966:9; Hansford, Bendor-Samuel &amp; Stanford 1976:182) and in the early ethno- graphic literature (e.g., Meek 1931, vol.2; Macbride 1936), the people refer to themselves as 'Bena ('B=glottalized "b"; e=schwa). Nevertheless, for the sake of clarity here, the name Yungur has been retained to avoid confusion with their close linguistic neighbors, who also call themselves 'Bena and who have been identified as such elsewhere in the literature (see Berns 1986, 1989a; Nissen 1968). 2. The Diterra section is called Pirra in the early ethnographic literature. Meek (1931, vol. 2:437) and the various touring officers who submitted reports on the district (see NAK G2.0, G2.P) consistently distinguish the Pirra Yungur from the Suktu and the Waltandi. They also recognize Diterra as the Pirra spiritual center. The name Pirra is no longer used by the Yungur, although they admit that it was formerly applied to the agglomeration of hamlets around the Diterra ritual precinct. Today, these hamlets are within the village of Dirma with Diterra in the hills above. The modern town of Dumne is the Yungur administrative center. It was established during the colonial period and grew after the Sudan United Mission built a station there in the 1930s (see Nissen 1968:155). 3. Meek details Yungur social and political organization (1931: vol. 2:443). Even more emphasis is given to these sub- jects in the lengthy and comprehensive "Intelligence Report" submitted by Assistant District Officer D.H.F. Macbride (1936). 4. In 1936, sixteen hamlets recognized the authority of the gubo of Diterra; the Suktu gubo was responsible for ten ham- lets (Macbride 1936:1). 5. The precise location of Mukan has not yet been deter- mined, although I have argued elsewhere that it may have been the hill the Ga'anda call Mokwar (Berns 1989a:55). 6. Interviews with groups of elders from the Yungur locali- ties of Diterra, Suktu, and Waltandi yielded different answers concerning who produces wiiso. Suktu and Waltandi elders said women were the primary artists, while the pagubsa of Diterra claimed that men from the Bera Kumla clan made zliiso. Research priorities at the time diverted my attention from exploring these inconsistencies. The gender of those who made and still make these pots needs to be rein- vestigated in the field. I hope to undertake more intensive interviews with women about the range of their ceramic pro- duction and its meanings. 7. An article dealing with the role of women as producers of such material symbols is forthcoming, based on a paper I delivered in 1989 (Berns 1989b). 8. Although the scarification of boys is now non-obligatory, all Yungur men formerly had forehead, cheek, and navel scarifications. These scarifications are identical in design to those given girls in a mandatory program of full body and facial scarification, called Sa, executed to establish their eligi- bility for marriage. The girl's program begins with a series of concentric chevrons over the navel and then progresses each dry season, focusing on particular sections of the body. It is this same navel marking, called detkale, that is sometimes worked on men and visible on many wiiso pots. For more on Yungur initiation and scarification, see Chappel 1977; Berns 1986:55, 263-68; Berns 1988). 9. The relationship between scarification markings and their transposition to sacred ceramic vessels has been discussed in detail in an article on the Ga'anda (Berns 1988), northern neighbors of the Yungur with whom many social and cultur- al patterns are shared. 10. As I explained in note 6, other research priorities are responsible, in part, for my not investigating these inconsis- tencies in gender. My present sensitivity to these issues demands that I return to the field and seek answers to these questions. 11. See note 5. 12. These shrines were maintained by former war priests (kpana), who also kept the skulls of enemies killed in battle in other thatched enclosures (xitkpana)(see Meek 1931, vol. 2:458). The sons of deceased gubsa would collect cowrie shells for making into net caps that would fit over their fathers' skulls. If transformed in this fashion, a skull would be elevated and transferred to the ditguno, the "important shrine," at Diterra. 13. The equivalence between skulls and ancestors is also evi- dent for Yungur "commoners," where a tooth from the skull can be ground into a powder and mixed with beer as a cure for illness; beer also can be poured into the skull at harvest time (Meek 1931, vol. 2:464). 14. The use of pot burials is not common in northeastern Nigeria. The closest example is documented in the highlands north of Garoua in northern Cameroon, where the ancestors of the present-day Fali buried their dead in large pottery urns grouped together in necropoli (Gauthier &amp; Jansen 1973). These archaeologically recovered pot burials have been related to those of the Sao, and have been used to trace the migration route of the Sao out of the Lake Chad Basin. I have discussed elsewhere (Berns 1986:427-30) the implica- tions of these burial traditions for understanding the histori- cal relationships among these groups. 15. Diterra pagubsa told me in 1981 that all the former kpanda had been destroyed by a fire, leaving only the one example. Although it resembles the sketch of a kpanda fragment in Chappel 1977 (fig. 221c), it is hard to generalize about the past style of these wood effigies. 16. Besides the sculptures from the Menil and the de Grunne collections, discussed later in this article, examples of the sculptures identified as "Mboye" (Mboi is the preferred spelling; see Hansford et al. 1976:127) are illustrated in Arman 1980 (figs. 5, 31) and in Oerkunsten van Zwart Africa, 1977 (fig. 58). For information about the Mboi, see Meek 1931, vol. 2:480 and Bers 1986:287-94. 17. One of the questions surrounding the Menil piece in Figure 16 is its relationship to the broader geographical dis- tribution of wood sculpture in northeastern Nigeria, such as those made by the northeastern Jukun or the Wurkun. Their stylistic similarities are evident in the series of juxtaposed photographs of Jukun, Mboi, and Wurkun figures published in Gillon (1984: figs.90-93). The overhanging jaw of the Jukun and Mboi figures, also true of wooden funerary fig- ures made by the 'Bena (see Berns 1986: figs.83-84), is one striking feature that may support historical ties between the Mboi-Yungur and the Jukun. This historical issue will be addressed in Rubin &amp; Berns, forthcoming. 18. The process of selecting a gubo by means of divination is described in Meek (1931, vol. 2:441-42) and in Macbride (1936:24-25). After a choice is made, the suitability of the gubo is further tested. He is taken to a sacred cave at Hombo, where he proves his ability to undergo various physical transformations before making rain. 19. Chappel notes that the hills above Diterra are littered with the remains of these finials (1977:205). The use of such figurated ceramics to mark the houses of chiefs is also com- mon among groups living along the western flank of the Mandara Mountains (see Drost 1956; Sterner 1989; Wente- Lukas 1977). 20.

BLACKMUN: Notes, from page 69 The Portuguese archival sources used in this article were obtained from summaries and transcripts kept by the Centro de Estudos de Historia e Cartografia Antiga in Lisbon. These documents were collected and organized at the initiative of A. Teixeira da Mota and Luis de Albuquerque and have been compiled by a group of investigators over many years. I am grateful to Professor Luis de Albuquerque for access to these documents and for his warm welcome to the Center, and to Dr. Maria Emilia Madeira Santos for her unfailing interest and assistance in suggesting relevant sources. I would like to thank them both for sharing their vast knowledge of fif- teenth- and sixteenth-century Portuguese activities in West Africa. I owe a large debt to Joao Paulo de Oliveira e Costa for his patience in locating and photocopying original docu- ments at the Archivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo in Lisbon and for his painstaking assistance with translation. Finally, I appreciate very much the 1987 Summer Stipend from the National Endowment for the Humanities that made this research possible. 1. The five reliefs of past kings described here are accompa- nied by two others portraying sixteenth-century Benin women, Idia and Enahen. These two additional portraits are placed on a palace wall to the left of the main entrance facade, near the women's section of the royal complex of buildings. 2. The number is based upon oral traditions compiled by Egharevba (1968), whose summaries are widely accepted in Benin. Bradbury has discussed the historiography of these oral records (1973:17-43). 3. The image of Ovoranmwen most familiar to the Edo appears on the frontispiece of Great Benin (Roth 1903). Although I have been unable to locate the original print, Dr. George Bankes of the Manchester Museum at the University of Manchester has kindly supplied this very similar photo- graph of Ovoranmwen made at the same sitting. 4. A portrait of Eweka as crown prince, carved upon a coconut shell, is illustrated but misunderstood by von Luschan (1919:489, abb. 842). The shell (IIIC 21935a),which was purchased in 1901, portrays Ovoranmwen's adult son wearing the "medicinal" clothing of an herbalist as he works with the powerful tongs and L-shaped metalworking ham- mer of Ogun. He is dwarfed by the looming prow of the ship that carried his father away. The images are identified by the letters "AGVBASIMI" and "BOAT." The photograph is unclear, but the carving appears to contain additional motifs that deserve careful study. 5. Oranmiyan was the son of the first Oni of Ife. He was invited to rule in Benin at the request of its elders and chiefs. After a time he returned to Ile Ife, leaving his young heir, Eweka, in Benin to be trained as the Oba. A parallel was drawn between this first Eweka and Prince Aiguobasimwin, whose father, Ovoranmwen, would never be able to return. 6. Benin tradition states that the title of Iyase or Iyashere was first given by the fifteenth-century Oba Ewuare when he extablished the state council, or eghaevbo n'ore (Egharevba 1968:16). This council consists of the four highest-ranking town chiefs who represent the Edo people (Bradbury 1973:67). The Iyase is the head of the eghaevbo n'ore, and leads any opposition that might arise against the Oba's poli- cies. Bradbury discusses the importance of this conceptual balance between the Oba and his subjects (1973:68-69). In the past the Iyase usually also served as the Field Marshal, or Captain of War. 7. In reference to eighteenth-century brasswork, Dark point- ed out that "an elbowed arm and hand holding a trefoil which derives from an elephant trunk" is part of "a vocabu- lary of art motifs...a complex of traits, that is diagnostic of the time of Oba Eresonyen (Forman &amp; Dark 1960:20). The trunk-hand also can be found on brass objects of this period 102</page></plain_text>
