<plain_text><page sequence="1">Identifying Restoration Opportunities for Northern White Cedar by Contrasting Historical and Modern Inventories in an Ecological Classification System Context Eric K Zenner and John C Almendinger ABSTRACT We propose an approach toward identifying restoration opportunities on the landscape using historical Public Land Survey (PLS) data and modern Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data within an ecological classification system (ECS) context, and demonstrate this approach for northern white cedar ( Thuja occidental ) in Minnesota, U.S.A. Concern over long-term declines in the abundance of northern white cedar, particularly in younger (&lt;40 yr) upland stands, has spurred interest in northern white cedar restoration in the Lake States region. Comparing historical PLS and modern FIA data revealed a decline in long-term northern white cedar area by 45% due to land use conversion and species shifts in extant forests in Minnesota. Changes in extent and relative abundance varied by ECS land type association (LTA): decreases occurred predominantly in mixed species stands and upland northern white cedar communities, while increases occurred in monotypie stands and lowland northern white cedar communities. We suggest that this landscape variation can guide adaptive management and restoration by focusing adaptive management on LTAs in which northern white cedar has fared well, and restoration on LTAs in which northern white cedar has dramatically declined. Where the data are available, this ECSpls FIA approach could facilitate the prioritization of potential restoration candidate areas by revealing population dynamics in a temporal context that match the life span of the species of interest. Keywords: ECS, Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA), Land Type Association (LTA), pre-settlement, Public Land Survey (PLS) The species restoration and associated of declining plant tree species and associated plant communities requires a contextual understanding of the temporal scales relevant to managing landscapes that have long-lived organisms (Swetnam et al. 1999). Because these long-term dynamics are not uniform across the landscape (e.g., Jackson et al. 2000, Friedman and Reich 2005), some areas may need active restoration while others require none. Restoration efforts must therefore be prioritized, and a strategic approach is needed to identify restoration opportuni- ties. This strategy in turn requires a clear understanding of historical and Ecological Restoration Vol. 30, No. 3, 201 2 ISSN 1 522-4740 E-ISSN 1 543-4079 Â©201 2 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System. current distributions of the ecosystem of concern and a model to relate plant communities to physical site charac- teristics (Palik et al. 2000). Wide- spread application, however, further requires a repeatable approach that does not rely on subjective analyses, such as classification and ordination (Bollinger et al. 2004, Schulte et al. 2007). We present a simple, spatially explicit approach to provide strategic guidance to help managers identify site conditions in which active res- toration efforts for a tree species of concern would be warranted, using the focal species, northern white cedar ( Thuja occidentalis ). We use 3 sources of data that are spatially referenced, available for large areas, and amenable to study within a geographic informa- tion system (GIS): 1) U.S. General Land Office Public Land Survey (PLS) records as a source for the location and extent of historical vegetation; 2) U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data as a source for the location and extent of modern vegetation; and 3) an Ecological Clas- sification System (ECS) framework for linking species to landscape and site. Using this ECSpLS _FIA approach, we quantify 4 specific parameters to best reflect the long-term dynamics of a focal tree species of concern. First, we assess statewide range expansion or contraction because changes at the range limits may reflect coarse- scale ecological processes (e.g., global warming) that cannot be addressed by local restoration projects alone. Second, we quantify irreversible loss of available habitat within the historical September 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:3 ^ 169</page><page sequence="2">range because settlement history often creates non-forested areas where com- munities cannot be restored. Third, we link historical and modern extent to the land type association (LTA) level of an ECS to compute the absolute change in both monotypie and mixed forests, allowing us to gauge in what settings the focal species has been lost or gained and where potential for future restoration or continued man- agement exists. Finally, we determine change in relative abundance, which reflects the shift in contribution by a focal species to the forest composition in a given LTA and is an indicator of recovery potential in a geographic area. We used PLS records to provide information on the pre-European vegetation of 100-150 yr ago, enabling estimates of long-term veg- etation changes (Galatowitsch 1990). PLS records have been the primary resource for reconstructing pre-set- dement vegetation and constructing historical distribution maps of forest types (e.g., Marshner 1930), relat- ing pre-settlement vegetation to soils (e.g., Whitney 1986), reconstructing natural disturbance patterns and fire history (e.g., Grimm 1984), assess- ing changes in species composition (e.g., Janke et al. 1978), and under- standing landscape pattern change over time (e.g., Friedman and Reich 2005). Knowledge of pre-European vegetation conditions as historical ref- erence conditions can help identify both restoration priorities (Hessburg et al. 1999) and appropriate locations for restoration efforts (Galatowitsch 1990), resulting in high conservation benefits (Palik et al. 2000). We used FIA data to characterize modern vegetation because they are the primary source of geo-referenced information about the extent, condi- tion, status, and trends of contempo- rary forests in the U.S. (Smith 2002). The FLA survey is designed for long- term repeated measurements of tim- berland using permanent field plots quasi-systematically located across all ownerships in the U.S. to achieve a stratified sample of forest types (Smith 2002). In addition to many variables that describe land ownership and site, other metrics include forest type and tree species, size, and condition, which enable estimates of areas of forest land by species group for entire states and regions (e.g., Miles and Chen 1992). However, summarizations of FLA sub- plot data at large spatial scales can be difficult to connect back to site (e.g., Schulte et al. 2005, 2007). To place site within the land- scape context, we linked data on the focal species to site via an existing ECS that maps progressively smaller areas of land with increasingly uni- form features (MNDNR 2003). The finest scale of completed ECS map- ping across Minnesota is the Land Type Association (LTA; following the National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units, Cleland et al. 1997), which is delineated using abiotic factors (glacial landforms, bedrock types, topographic roughness, soil parent material) and pre-settlement vegetation (MNDNR 2003). For this study, the LTA level is advantageous because LTAs strongly control tree distribution in natural forests (Host and Pregitzer 1992) and define land- . scapes of -5,000-120,000 ha, which are meaningful analytical units of tree population dynamic^. We chose to demonstrate the ECSpLs pu approach on the focal spe- cies of northern white cedar, a slow- growing, moderately shade tolerant, long-lived conifer of both upland and lowland ecosystems throughout the northern portions of the eastern U.S. and adjacent southern portions of Canada (Johnston 1990). Northern white cedar swamps and forests are important for the conservation of rare plants and habitat for-over 50 wildlife species (Doepker and Ozoga 1991, Smith 1993). In past decades there has been litde to no recruitment in north- ern white cedar stands throughout a large portion of its range (Thornton 1957, Miller et al. 1991). As a con- sequence, the extent of the northern white cedar cover type has declined (Miles and Chen 1992), many stands have converted to hardwoods and other conifers (Thornton 1957, Miller et al. 1991), and there is pronounced age skewing towards old northern white cedar stands across the Lake States region (Rooney et al. 2002). Between 1970 and 1992, the total area of young northern white cedar forest &lt;10 yr old declined by 84% in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Heitzman et al. 1997), and virtually no white cedar is found in the sapling and pole size classes in northeastern Minnesota (Cornett et al. 2000). Fur- ther, between 1990 and 2004, FLA data for Minnesota show a reduc- tion of 16% in northern white cedar cover type extent (Miles and Chen 1992, Miles and Brand 2007). The consistent decline of northern white cedar extent over the past 2 decades has raised concerns about long-term sustainability. Consequently, state and federal management agencies across the region have imposed restrictions on northern white cedar harvest- ing (Miller et al. 1991, Heitzman et al. 1997), and interest in restoring northern white cedar forests is rising (MNDNR 2006). This paper describes the ECSpLS fia aPProach ^d presents an analy- sis of the long-term dynamics of northern white cedar. We also dis- cuss the broader applicability of this approach and provide management recommendations for northern white cedar. Methods Historical (PLS) and Modern (FIA) Data Sources We used PLS land survey notes and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' comprehensive and seamless bearing tree database (Almendinger 1996) to characterize the historical distribution and abun- dance of the northern white cedar ca. 1847-1908. Although the PLS was not designed to survey vegetation, we used trees to document the location 170 &amp; September 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:3</page><page sequence="3">of section and quarter section corners. At each corner, surveyors selected 2-4 witness trees from different quadrants and recorded their diameter, distance, and azimuth (hence "bearing tree") from the corner. This method provides a sparse, but systematic survey of the forest vegetation on a 0.805-km grid (Friedman et al. 2001). In this study, we treat PLS corners as surrogates of FLA subplots because both record similar tree data. We used a subset of the 1990 East- wide FLA survey (Cycle 5) database maintained by the U.S. Forest Service to characterize the modern distribu- tion and abundance of the focal tree species. This survey used a series of 10 nested subplot clusters covering approximately 0.5 ha. In each subplot, we sampled trees &gt;12.7 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) with a 8.6-m2/ ha Basal Area Factor (BAF) variable radius plot (hence "prism trees") (Miles and Chen 1992). We used the 1990 inventory because it was the most intensive and data-rich inven- tory cycle, providing the best possible estimate for the modern distribution of northern white cedar and because it was collected prior to the presumed onset of global warming effects. Ecological Classification System (ECS) and Stratification by Land Type Association (LTA) Of the 291 LTAs identified in Min- nesotas ECS, 160 occur in the Lau- rentian Mixed Forest province where northern white cedar is predominandy found (MNDNR 2003). Although we used LTAs for all calculations of focal tree abundance, it is possible that finer ECS levels, such as ecological systems based on plant community classifica- tion, could be more reliable for iden- tifying restoration sites (Pidgeon et al. 2005). However, plant community maps are not yet available for direct application with PLS and FLA data. To explore whether or not Ecological Sys- tems might help explain abundance changes, we identified which Ecologi- cal System was most predominant in any given LTA. Ecological Systems reflect groups of native plant com- munities that are strongly influenced by a set of ecological processes, notably nutrient cycling and natural distur- bances (MNDNR 2003). For north- ern white cedar, we considered upland (upland fire-depÄndent and upland mesic-hardwood forests), wet forest, and peatlanÄ(rich forested peatlands) Ecological Systems (MNDNR 2003). Sampling and Bias To allow a direct comparison of PLS bearing trees and FLA prism trees, some modifications were required for both datasets. We omitted all non- forest corners from the PLS dataset to match the definition of FIA "for- estland". We retained survey corners described as timber, barrens, dry ridge, grove, bottom, dry land, openings, swamp, thicket, burned area, valley, windthrown, or island because they fell in what surveyors described as forestland. To ensure that a common minimum tree diameter was applied, we retained for analysis only PLS bear- ing trees and FLA prism trees &gt;12.7 cm DBH. In addition, we selected sample trees from the FLA subplot dataset using instructions similar to those followed by the PLS surveyors (i.e. following the point-centered quarter method, Stearns 1949). This approach mimicked the low sample size of bear- ing trees by selecting only the closest prism tree in each quadrant in each FLA subplot and created a proxy PLS database of FLA subplot prism trees. Despite the potential accuracy limitations of the estimate of modern extent, it was necessary and appropri- ateTbr us to work with a proxy data- base to ensure comparability of the PLS and FLA datasets in our efforts to quantify long-term changes relative to pre-setdement conditions. We further caution that even though PLS data are one of the best records of pre-Euro- pean Settlement vegetation available, these data are not free of bias. Surveyor biases toward species and tree size have been shown in PLS records, favoring longer-lived species, smaller trees less likely to be cut in the near future, or trees that are easily scribed (Manies et al. 2001, Schulte and Mladenoff 2001). Consequently, surveyors did not always select the trees nearest to the plot center. Although the reliability of PLS witness tree data for estimat- ing pre-settlement species abundances remains elusive, investigating patterns across large landscape scales and large sample sizes alleviates some species bias in bearing tree data (Friedman et al. 2001, Schulte and Mladenoff 2001). For example, relative species composition and the rank order of land cover types have been accurately estimated at large spatial scales, with- out strong species bias, when using the PLS sampling method (Manies et al. 2001). Similarly, Almendinger (1996) found only a small discrepancy (&lt; 1 %) in the frequency of northern white cedar noted as a bearing tree compared to line trees, which were not scribed and presumably free from any discrim- ination associated with corner mark- ing. Nonetheless, we caution that our estimate of historical northern white cedar may be biased slightly high. For identifying restoration opportu- nities on the landscape, however, we deemed acceptable a potential bias resulting in a slight overestimate of areas potentially in need of restoration. Calculations and Statistics We determined the historical range of northern white cedar by intersecting point occurrences of PLS bearing trees with a statewide map of LTAs in a GIS (ArcGIS 2009). Likewise, we created a comparable modern range map by intersecting FLA prism trees with the LTA map. We then tallied the number of LTAs containing northern white cedar from each data source and com- pared them to summarize statewide range changes. To summarize changes in the extent of northern white cedar, we expanded PLS corners and FLA subplots to the area they represent. There are 108 survey corners unique to each 9,324- ha township - all interior corners and those along 2 exterior lines that are September 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:3 ^ 171</page><page sequence="4">assigned to that township, such that each corner represents about 86.3 ha. The PLS dataset contained 122,685 survey corners in the foresdand con- dition with at least one bearing tree &gt;12.7 cm DBH, such that each PLS corner represented 99 ha. The FIA dataset contained 63,329 FLA sub- plots in foresdand, such that each FIA subplot represented 107 ha. For each LTA, we calculated the area of forest for the focal tree species by multiplying the number of sampling points (PLS survey corners or FIA sub- plots) that had at least one northern white cedar by either 99 (historical) or 107 (modern). Change in extent was the difference between these esti- mates, which was further partitioned in 2 ways. First, we wanted to know how much loss was due to irreversible â¢ conversion of foresdand to another use. We determined this by intersect- ing PLS survey corners with satel- lite images classifying land as either forested or non-forested (MNDNR 2007). We also determined whether the loss or gain occurred in lowland or upland sites by calculating area for monotypie situations (typical of low- lands), where all trees belonged to the focal tree species, as well as for mixed situations (typical of uplands). Our analysis of the relative abun- dance of the focal tree to other tree species is constrained to areas continu- ously forested since the PLS survey. We calculated the relative abundance of northern white cedar (expressed in percent) as a proportion of all trees within an LTA in the respective data- set. We calculated change in the rela- tive abundance as both the difference in relative abundance between modern and historical times (absolute change), and the ratio of modern to histori- cal relative abundance (proportional change). We used one-way analysis of vari- ance to test whether or not the pre- dominant Ecological System in each LTA could help explain the variability in changes in the extent of northern white cedar across the landscape (as total area of northern white cedar, monotypie area, and mixed area), and changes in relative abundance (abso- lute and proportional) in the extant forest. LTA was the unit of analysis, and we assigned each LTA to one of three categorical classes reflecting its predominant Ecological System: upland forest (N= 26), wet forest (N= 47), or peadand (N= 54). Results Range , Extent , and Composition Maps of the PLS survey corners and FLA proxy subplots that contain northern white cedar indicate largely similar historical and modern ranges in Minnesota, with some loss along the southern edge of the distribution (Figure 1). This loss along the south- ern edge involved isolated populations that accounted for &lt; 1 % of the bearing trees in those LTAs. Modern north- ern white cedar area declined to 55% of its historical extent (Table 1). Of the area lost, 78% was converted to non-forest and 22% was converted to other species of extant forest. Of the land converted to non-forest uses, 74% occurred in mixed and 26% in monotypie forest settings. Historically, northern white cedar was more prominent in mixed (72% by area) than monotypie forests (28%), but modern northern white cedar was more prominent in mono- typie (60%) than mixed (40%) forests (Table 1). Nearly 70% of historical northern white cedar area in mixed forests was lost as a result of both land conversion and species conversion. Although there was a substantial loss of monotypie northern white cedar area to land conversion, this loss was more than offset by a 19.5% area gain in monotypie forest in the remaining extant forest. The pattern of northern white cedar area losses in mixed forests and gains in monotypie forests was seen across all LTAs, regardless of LTA size. Overall, the statewide abundance of northern white cedar trees relative to other species in extant forest held steady through time (6.6% of PLS bearing trees vs. 6.7% of FIA prism trees in 1990). Land Type Associations (LTAs) Historically, northern white cedar was listed among the bearing trees in 127 LTAs, whereas modern northern white cedar prism trees occurred in only 95 LTAs. The loss of northern white cedar in 34 LTAs was due to land conversion (35%), changes in species composi- tion (12%), or a combination of both factors (53%). Northern white cedar occurred in 2 additional LTAs along the northwestern edge in the modern sampling, but this gain involved only 4 FLA trees, accounting for &lt;0.2% of all FIA trees sampled in those LTAs. Of the 127 LTAs with historical northern white cedar area, 57% (N = 73) lost area and 33% (N= 42) gained area (Figure 2). Losses ranged from a few hundred to 18,200 ha (median: 1,360 ha) and increased with the size of LTAs and the proportion of the LTA that was northern white cedar habitat. The pattern of greatest loss was in an east-west band through the center of the range in northern Minnesota. Sig- nificant gains in northern white cedar area occurred in only 2 peadand LTAs (up to 28,530 ha, median: 740 ha). In mixed forest settings, northern white cedar lost up to 13,700 ha (median: 21,180 ha) in 94 of the 126 LTAs in which it occurred, and gained up to 1 , 1 90 ha (median: 1 1 0 ha) in only 20 LTAs; in monotypie forest, losses were up to 4,410 ha (median: 300 ha) in 42 LTAs while gains were up to 29,270 ha (median: 930 ha) in 63 LTAs. Historical relative abundance of northern white cedar in extant forests was highly variable among LTAs, rang- ing from &lt;l%-40% (median: 6.9%). In extant forests, northern white cedars relative abundance increased in 43% of LTAs and declined in 57% (Figure 3). For 21% of LTAs the abso- lute difference in relative abundance was &lt;1%, and most change (71% of LTAs) was &lt;5% (Figure 3A). Propor- tional change in relative abundance provides a rough estimate of how northern white cedar populations are 172 &amp; September 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:3</page><page sequence="5">Figure 1.

For LTAs with declining relative abun- dance but with at least some remain- ing northern white cedar, 28% were reduced by more than half. For LTAs with increasing relative abundance of northern white cedar, 18% at least doubled their proportion of northern white cedar. Ecological Systems Between historical and modern times, statistically significant reductions in the extent of mixed northern white cedar forests were detected in all Eco- logical Systems (p &lt; 0.001), with the smallest area lost in peatlands (Figure 4A). The area of extant monotypie northern white cedar forests decreased in uplands (p = 0.15), but increased significandy in wet forests (p = 0.007) and peadands (p &lt; 0.001) (Figure 4B). Relative abundance of northern white cedar in extant forests decreased in uplands (p = 0.002) and in wet forests (p = 0.12), and increased in peatlands (p = 0.2) (Figure 4C). lhe propor- tional abundance of relative northern white cedar was significantly reduced (by 40%) in uplands (p [factor = 1] &lt; 0.001) and increased modestly, but not statistically significantly, in wet forests and peadands (both p &gt; 0.15) (Figure 4D). Discussion The EC5pLS FIA Approach Various combinations of PLS, FLA, and ECS data hÃ¡ve been used previ- ously to identify restoration priorities. For instance, historical PLS data have been used to identify potential areas for the restoration of broad vegeta- tion classes (e.g., Bollinger et al. 2004, Rhemtulla et al. 2007), FIA data have been used to validate the LTA-level of an ECS (He et al. 2010), ECSs have been developed in conjunction with FIA-data augmented by remote sensing data to characterize wildlife habitat potential (Felix et al. 2007), Table 1.

A very similar approach to ours has also been previously used to model potential bird species habitat based on changes in habitat availability (Pidgeon et al. 2005). Our approach has increased the application of these tools by using easily repeatable methods to target an individual species of concern, ensure comparability between historical and modern data, and prepare site-specific recommendations. Our straightforward approach of linking temporal changes in the abundance of a specific focal species of concern to LTAs allows for the identification of landscapes in need of management attention. Although our analyses were limited to the yet highly variable LTA-scale for which data were available, the results should direct managers to areas on the land- scape for which more specific atten- tion is warranted (e.g., evaluation at the plant community scale). We view this as a coarse-filter strategy to help managers identify areas in the forest matrix suitable for either adaptive management or a continued moratorium on northern white cedar harvest (Seymour and Hunter 1999). The advantages of this approach include capitalizing on whichever level of ECS is currently available for a region, tracking long-term dynam- ics over time periods that correspond to the life-span of the target species, and evaluating historical conditions for regions in which anthropomorphic changes took place well before aerial photos, â¢ satellite imagery, or other sources of historical conditions were available. In this era of global climate change, PLS dataseis provide a means to assess historical range, abundance, and dynamics, while FIA dataseis can provide data just prior to the onset of detectable climate change as well as present conditions. Using an ECS framework enables the direct translation of assessment results to landscape-level planning. For example, to assign restoration priorities, managers might consider current and historical abundance or rarity of an ecosystem, the degree of similarity between current and refer- ence conditions, and embeddedness of a restoration candidate patch within the landscape (Palik et al. 2000). The exact hierarchy of criteria used to assign restoration priority will vary, as will the metrics considered. Total acreage could be used as an indica- tor of embeddedness and restoration potential. LTAs showing the greatest loss in extent and relative abundance, reflecting remnant northern white cedar patches embedded in a land- scape dominated by commercial tree species, might demonstrate the great- est need for, and potential benefits of, restoration. However, restoration potential may be low due to a greater dissimilarity to historic conditions, which may increase restoration costs, assuming that highly disturbed sites where conditions are more dissimilar to a reference condition require more effort than minimally disturbed sites (Palik et al. 2000). In contrast, LTAs with high remaining acreage might be considered to have a higher poten- tial for successful restoration because they reflect Currently suitable habitat conditions. In addition, LTAs with historically high and currently low abundance might be viewed as those with the greatest conservation benefit. Regardless, a clear understanding of the underlying causes for a species' demise is the foundation for reversing its deterioration in the long run. Ref- erence conditions are useful for decid- ing ecologically justifiable restoration goals (Swetnam et al. 1999), and investigating long-term changes in a spatially explicit manner within eco- logical units in an ecological classifica- tion system that reflects different pat- terns and processes provides a useful framework for aiding the restoration process and restoration prioritization for any species or ecosystem. 174 * September 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:3</page><page sequence="7">Figure 3. Absolute change (A) and proportional change (B) in relative abundance of northern white cedar ( Thuja occidentalis) from historical (PLS circa 1847-1908) to modern (FIA 1990) times in Minnesota forests. Northern White Cedar Based on our findings, we conclude that the range and the patchy nature of northern white cedar distribution have changed little since pre-settlement times. In addition, its extent within this range has declined considerably over the last 150 yr, substantiating calls for restoration. Finally, long-term population dynamics have not been uniform throughout the landscape, providing guidance to areas with the greatest potential for restoration. We found that there are some LTAs with Ecological Systems in which the abun- dance of northern white cedar has expanded (providing opportunities for conservation and management), but that there are many more LTAs where northern white cedar has expe- rienced long-term decline (providing opportunities for restoration). We do not believe that the absence of northern white cedar in the modern dataset at the southern and southwestern margin of the distribu- tion indicates range erosion because there are well-documented extant northern white cedar populations in south-central Minnesota (NRCS 2012). The apparent loss of small peripheral populations in a region with historically low abundances of meager populations could reflect sparse FLA sampling, the misinterpre- tation of bearing tree species notes in areas of range overlap of similar spe- cies (NRCS 2012), or the mismatch between the precise locations sampled by each survey (Friedman and Reich 2005). The historical low abundance of northern white cedar at the south- ern edge of its Minnesota range, how- ever, implies that this region has only limited restoration potential. Further, given projected range contraction and reductions in landscape-level impor- tance values under even the most conservative climate change models (Prasad et al. 2012), greater opportu- nities for restoration and management exist within the core of its historical range, where the vast majority (98%) of northern white cedar habitat losses was observed. A fidi third of northern white cedar s historical habitat in Minnesota has been converted to other land uses. Loss of forest in the Lake States through widespread land-clearing began in the 2nd half of the 19th century and may represent up to 40% of all forestland existing at the time of European settle- ment (Frelich 1995, 2002). Land con- version through drainage of swamps, creation of impoundments, clearing of agricultural lands, and removal of the overburden in mining were the greatest contributors to loss of north- ern white cedar habitat and accounted for 78% of the total reduction of the northern white cedar area. Given that these nearly 250,000 ha are no longer available for restoration, we believe that concern for the loss of northern white cedar habitat is legiti- mate and that the first conservation September 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:3 * 175</page><page sequence="8">Figure 4.

Nonetheless, 42% of northern white cedar area losses occurred within extant forests. Despite a general per- ception that we need to restore north- ern white cedar everywhere, the need for restoration is local and particularly focused on mixed and upland settings. Nearly 60% of all mixed northern white cedar forest, across nearly every LTA and in all Ecological Systems, was converted to other forest types. In contrast, there was a net gain of mono- typie northern white cedar forest. As a consequence, a forest landscape once dominated by 2.5 times more mixed northern white cedar forest now has 10% more monotypie northern white cedar forest than mixed. Simi- larly, relative abundance of north- ern white cedar decreased by nearly half in LTAs dominated by uplands where mixed conditions are more common, and more than doubled in LTAs dominated by forested peadands where monotypie conditions prevail. Of the top 10 LTAs that expanded their northern white cedar area or the relative abundance of northern white cedar, 6 were dominated by forested peatlands and the rest by wet forests. This loss of northern white cedar as an important element of mixed upland forests and the increase in monotypie lowland northern white cedar forests reflects a substantially more homo- geneous forest matrix in the modern landscape (Friedman and Reich 2005, Schulte et al. 2007). The expansion of northern white cedar in peatlands may reflect both the relative stability of this habitat and comparative advantages in reproduc- tion. Large peatlands are well buffered from human activity, and attempts to drain them have largely failed (Wright et al. 1992). Although the loss of peat- land northern white cedar has been reported in Michigan due to altering hydrologie regimes through road construction and timber harvesting (Verme and Johnston 1986, Miller et al. 1991), Minnesotas peatlands are vast by comparison, and the 2 LTAs where northern white cedar increased the most occupy some 295,000 ha of nearly unfragmented peadand habi- tat. Further, a major northern white cedar regenerative strategy in the Great Lakes region is seeding onto burned or windthrown peatlands (Verme and Johnston 1986, Scott and Murphy 1987, Heitzman et al. 1997), where northern white cedar is also able to vegetatively reproduce through branch layering (Verme and Johnston 1986, Scott and Murphy 1987). Our inter- pretation is that northern white cedar was successful in Minnesotas inac- cessible peatlands largely by layer- ing in fine-scale canopy gaps, most likely in response to widespread loss of tamarack (Larix laricina) due to larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii) (MNDNR 1997). The increase in abundance observed in this study indicates that some management opportunities for sustainable utiliza- tion of northern white cedar may exist in these peadand systems. In contrast, restoration treatments may be able to expand northern white cedar extent in upland areas where timber management may have contributed to its decline. Fol- lowing European settlement, timber exploitation and large scale logging altered vegetation composition and species dominance across the region (Friedman and Reich 2005), shift- ing the competitive advantage from shade-tolerant coniferous species such as eastern white pine {Pintes strobus) and northern white cedar to broad- leaved, shade-intolerant deciduous trees (Thornton 1957, Jackson et al. 2000). In uplands, commercial forestry has replaced the natural disturbance regime of northern white cedar com- munities with more frequent and more intense disturbances, where slash fires often kill much of the advance regener- ation (MNDNR 2003, Friedman and Reich 2005), and clearcut sites provide 176 ^ September 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:3</page><page sequence="9">a competitive advantage to faster grow- ing species (Scott and Murphy 1987, Heitzman et al. 1997, Cornett et al. 2000). In addition, northern white cedar recruitment may be low due to unsuitable seedbed conditions fol- lowing logging and slow early height growth, combined with high palat- ability by over-abundant deer (Nelson 1951, Van Deelen 1 999, Cornett et al. 2000, Rooney et al. 2002, Hofmeyer et al. 2010). In light of an ever- increas- ing age imbalance between young and old stands in contemporary northern white cedar forests (MNDNR 2006), improving recruitment success may be an important tool for restoring these areas. On the other hand, the lack of young northern white cedar cover type in Minnesota may not in itself be cause for concern because old stands typed as northern white cedar may not necessarily be derived from young northern white cedar cover types. Northern white cedar is con- sidered a mid- to late-successional strategist with a regenerative strategy of filling gaps, with abundance of regeneration tending to increase with stand age (Johnston 1990, Kneeshaw and Bergeron 1998). Northern white cedar ingress may occur in response to the development of forest struc- tures that take time to develop, such as gaps and safe sites (Cornett et al. 2000), suggesting that its presence in some upland forests may remain low until stands reach middle age. However, most northern white cedar habitat is now occupied by young forests harvested before they reach the mature growth-stages (80-120 yr) that are most receptive to north- ern white cedar ingress (MNDNR 2003). Consequently, increasing recruitment and expanding northern white cedar cover types may require active management to favor northern white cedar, including silvicultural de- emphasis of the many other possible crop trees in northern mesic hardwood forests, longer rotations, and measures to reduce deer browsing (Verme and Johnston 1986, Cornett et al. 2000, Rooney et al. 2002). We recommend that restoration should primarily be aimed at increasing northern white cedar abundance relative to other tree species in mixed stands in upland set- tings throughout the core of its histori- cal distribution, rather than expanding the white cedar cover type' through plantations. Such an approach would also be prudent in light of projections of declining relative importance values of northern white cedar in Minnesota as a consequence of climate change (Prasad et al. 2012). Spreading resto- ration efforts out across the landscape may improve the chances of long-term regeneration success. Although there might be hesitation to actively manage stands with a northern white cedar component, a carefiil implementation of adaptive management strategies in uplands is essential to improve our understanding of northern white cedar ecology, determine more fully the rea- sons for regeneration and recruitment failures, and devise more successful silvicultural regeneration approaches. Approaches for these areas will require active management, including reten- tion of existing northern white cedar residual trees, gap creation, under- planting of northern white cedar, and browse protection for the maintain- ance, enhancement, and restoration of northern white cedar.
