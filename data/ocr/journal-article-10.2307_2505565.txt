On Thomas Eakins and Stephen Crane. By Michael Fried. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1987. Pp. xv, 215. Michael Fried has devoted a quarter of a century, half of his life, to working out the vision of art's history, a portion of which is presented in these two most recent of his books. His brilliantly precocious essays on modernist art of the 1960s have had a lasting influence on art criticism. His earlier book, Absorption and Theatricality: Painting and Beholder in the Age of Diderot, then extended his account backwards into the era of Diderot.I And now, in this book on Courbet and the long essay on Thomas Eakins which constitutes the first half of Realism, Writing, Disfiguration, he takes that analysis into the nineteenth century. While the details of Fried's account are highly complex, its central theme is elegantly simple; although Fried cited phenomenology and Clement Greenberg's criticism as influences in the 1960s, and now makes reference to Lacan, Foucault, Derrida and feminism, his essential theme is his own highly original creation. A visual artwork, we might naturally expect, is made to be seen by a spectator, that viewer whose position before the image is taken into account by the artist. But the goal of the most ambitious art of the past two centuries, Fried argues, has been to defeat or overcome this theatrical relationship between spectator and artwork. Courbet's ambition was "to absorb the painter-beholder as if bodily into the painting" (132), as if our proper position were not before it, but inside the illusionistic picture space. What defines the history of the art from 1. (Berkeley, 1980).</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ESSAYS 369 this period which concerns Fried is the changing ways painting has dealt with its presence before this spectator. Most of the essays in Courbet's Realism have been previously published; part of the interest of this book lies in how they now take their place in a large-scale presentation. In chapter one, "Approaching Courbet," Fried summarizes the position of this spectator as it is dealt with in French art before Courbet from Chardin to Millais; here, he explains, he provides a necessary bridge between this book and his earlier publications. In Theodore Gericault's Raft of the Medusa, for example, the figures on the raft strive to be rescued by the ship in the distance; it is "as if our presence before the painting were the ultimate cause of their plight" (31). By the time we get to Courbet, "the dramatic as such had come . . . to be perceived as inescapably theatrical"; compositions such as Gericault's were "increasingly seen merely as attesting to" the spectator's "con- trolling presence" (32). Chapter two discusses Courbet's early self portraits. In these images, he shows his body "as actually lived, as possessed from within" (65). Showing himself seen from the rear, or with closed eyes, are ways of eliminating any "apparent distance between himself and his painted image" (78). He depicts himself as he would be seen by another person, which is a way of eliminating himself as spectator placed before these images. Chapter three extends the account to compositions with several figures. Now Courbet can "identify with both figures in an offer to project his embodiedness into the painting as a whole" (97). In the Stonebreakers "the figures of the old stonebreaker and his young counterpart may be seen as representing the painter-beholder's right and left hands respec- tively"; the former holds a paintbrush-like staff, the latter a basket which "might be likened to ... a palette" (105). It is as if Courbet now depicts his body divided between these two different figures. Chapter four contains an extended discussion of A Burial of Ornans. This work has recently been much discussed by historians, who find its content and composition gives information about rural class conflicts. Fried's different argument is that the picture provides "two seemingly separate and different points of view" ( 137) for the beholder. Now Courbet's earlier project, providing a place in the picture space in which the viewer can be set, becomes harder to realize; he both gives that spectator a position within the work, and suggests that he or she is standing before the painting, looking at it. And this leads to a crisis in Courbet's art, which is not easily resolved. Chapter five examines that crisis, as Fried identifies it, focusing on three pictures from the 1850s depicting several figures. The most important and fa- mous of these, The Painter's Studio, has usually been interpreted as a complex allegory, a statement about contemporary French politics. Attending closely to the figure of the seated artist at the center, Fried suggests "that the painting on the easel, representing . . . a river landscape . . . may be seen . . . as flowing into the figure of the painter" (161). Here, as in his self-portraits, Courbet shows himself as if immersed in the image he himself makes. Chapter six argues that 4tourbet's art "is often structurally feminine" (189).</page><page sequence="3">370 REVIEW ESSAYS This is a surprising claim. As Fried admits, a number of Courbet's pictures are not merely erotic but pornographic. The nude female torso The Origin of the World, a painted version of a Playboy centerfold, which was owned by Jacques Lacan, could not have been publicly exhibited during the artist's lifetime. Cour- bet's sexism is compatible, Fried argues, with this implicit feminist concern. Earlier accounts draw attention, perhaps in a reductive way, to analogies be- tween such erotic pictures and the vaginal-like cave openings in Courbet's var- ious pictures of the source of the river Loue. Fried, arguing that the erotic pictures "evoke the notion of an act of sexual possession of the woman . .. by the painter-beholder" (220), links them to the way that Courbet's images of nature often involve "the representation of water moving toward the viewer" (214). This book was written over a long period and so not surprisingly it has been difficult to synthesize this material. When we move from the account of Courbet's self-portraits to the discussion of the center of The Painter's Studio to the chapter on Courbet as feminist, it is easy to feel that this narrative hangs together only when read as the story of Fried's changing approaches to Courbet. Fried is very good at attending to the individual pictures, but less successful at explaining Courbet's development. What then is most dissatisfying is the last chapter, "Courbet's Realism," which contains unresolved materials, some bril- liant, on a bewildering variety of themes: the anthropomorphism of Courbet's still lifes; Marx on production and consumption in relation to Courbet's realism; criticism of the idea that Courbet is a realist; speculations about narcissism; and remarks about photography and Clement Greenberg's view of modernism. Here Fried is doing what we all do in our early drafts, thinking out loud, but whereas we usually edit that material, Fried acts as if even his most tangential reflections deserved preservation. Only an author who has momentarily become as obliv- ious to his reader as Fried's Courbet is to his spectator would think that a book gains by this procedure. Compared with this book on Courbet, the essay on one painting by Thomas Eakins in Realism, Writing, Disfiguration is a less ambitious affair. (Here I will not discuss the second essay, which is on Stephen Crane.) Fried denies that Eakins's The Gross Clinic is a naturalistic picture. To "argue in these terms is to posit an original scene that in effect demanded its own exact transcription" (10-11). He sees rather a psychoanalytic "drama, some would say a melodrama, of visibility" (59). The surgeon Gross himself, who operates with the castrating scalpel, is a father-figure; a woman who refuses to look, a mother-surrogate; and at the back Eakins depicts himself. The general argument of this psychoanalytic reading is unexpected, though it is a little unexpected to find Fried endorsing it.2 What is more original, and serves to compensate for the somewhat reductive approach of this analysis, is the suggestion that the conflicts built into viewing 2. See, for example, Herwarth Rottgen, II Caravaggio: recherche e interpretazioni (Rome, 1974).</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW ESSAYS 371 the scene are linked to Eakins's conflicts between writing and painting, between "the demands of the 'graphic' (to see more and more) and the claims of the 'pictorial"' (87). Eakins's father, who remained close to his son whose ambitions he supported, was a writing master. Fried explains that Eakins had studied with various academic French painters in the 1860s unaware, it would seem, that the realist tradition within which he aspired to work ended with "Courbet's Realist pictures of the late 1840s and 1850s" (43). It is striking that The Gross Clinic (1875) was painted in the era of Manet, for Eakins's painting seems to belong to an earlier age. Fried says that "although I mostly refrain from juxtaposing Courbet and Eakins, a comparison ... is tacitly at work throughout this essay" (12). Here some further explanation would be helpful, for it is not obvious how he understands their relationship. Perhaps it was possible for Eakins to continue the realist tradition because he worked in what then was an artistically provincial country. But here I can only speculate. The strength of Fried's work is that it presents a comprehensive account of European painting from Diderot's time into the 1960s. Like Heinrich Woelfflin and Ernst Gombrich, Fried provides a plan into which everything can be fitted. Fried is an art historian in the grand manner, his finely detailed interpretations of individual works part of what may justly be called a master narrative. The limitations of Fried's work are equally obvious; one crucial question is whether they are inherent in his project, or merely gaps to be filled in by him or one of his followers. Traditional art historians are much concerned to link interpreta- tion with the artist's intentions, as they may be reconstructed from knowledge of that person's sketches, correspondence, or friendships. The reason for doing this is obvious. If we do not constrain interpretation thus, what prevents us from introducing merely subjective associations into our analysis? What the artist depicted is what he intended to show; and insofar as historians disagree about the interpretation of that picture, that is because they disagree about how to identify his intentions. Fried acknowledges, repeatedly, that his account is not such an analysis. "I am convinced that Courbet himself was largely unaware of the aspects of his work I focus on" (5). The artist himself was not an especially intellectual man and no contemporary attributes to him anything like the highly complex con- cerns Fried identifies. What evidence then has Fried to support his account? Sometimes the evidence for art historical interpretations is that they are visually convincing. If Michelangelo's Last Judgment can be shown to be composed along lines running through key figures, that is evidence that he intended that composition to be meaningful in ways which none of his contemporaries identi- fied.3 If some Flemish paintings contain puzzling elements whose inclusion can 3. Leo Steinberg's presentation of this case is discussed in my "Ekphrasis and Interpretation: Two Modes of Art History Writing," British Journal of Aesthetics 27 (1987), 20-31.</page><page sequence="5">372 REVIEW ESSAYS best be understood if they are treated as allegorical, that is evidence they are so intended, though no contemporary account says that they are allegories.4 If the figures in Piero della Francesca's Flagellation can only be identified by supposing that it makes a political statement, then that is a viable interpretation of that painting, though no early writer says that the work depicts such figures.5 When a picture looks puzzling, as these pictures do, art historians are willing to speculate about the artists' intentions. The deep question, which is not easy to answer, is what counts as a visually convincing interpretation. A good interpretation must get us to see how every element of the picture falls into place; an original interpretation shows us how to see that picture in unaccustomed ways. Fried's interpretations are certainly original, but are they also good? Consider some examples. He suggests that Courbet's Portrait of Baudelaire has as its source Rembrandt's Bathsheba (167); that the sifted wheat in Wheat Sifters "can ... be seen as a downpour of menstrual blood" (193); and that if we "read" the shadow-lattice in that work as a picture stretcher, the painting contains "corporeal metaphors for all three primary components that went into its making: pigment, canvas, and stretcher" (154). It is easy to question all of these claims. Baudelaire and Bathsheba both extend their left hands and look absorbed, but since one is a clothed man, and the other a naked woman, one a portrait and the other an historical subject, it would take more argument than Fried gives to show that Rembrandt's picture is Courbet's source. Since Baudelaire's pose is one the poet might have taken, a simpler theory is that Courbet's portrait requires no source. Jackson Pollock and Morris Louis, Fried notes, placed their paintings on the floor like the canvas in Wheat Sifters, "a coincidence, certainly, but one not without a certain allure" (153). That knowledge may suggest this interpretation to Fried, who wrote a book about Louis, but since Courbet could not know how his successors would work, why is this suggestion alluring? The grain is "flooding outward from the sifter's rose-draped thighs" (193), but since it is also heaped behind her on the ground and in bowls on her left, might we see all of that grain as menstrual blood? That attributes to Courbet a fantasy which a modern feminist painter might present, but which is hard to imagine a nineteenth-century man showing. No doubt now I am taking Fried's interpretation too far. But where should we stop? That the French word travail means both working and giving birth; that the painting's title in French, Les Cribleuses de blk plays on cribier, "to pierce someone all over" (193): Is this evidence for Fried's interpretation? If we are to see in the painting pigment, canvas, and stretcher, why stop there since as Fried notes it also contains an "ovenlike tarare" (193), which reminds me of the instrument of another art, the potter's oven. Pottery is often thought of as a 4. See my "Naturalism and Allegory in Flemish Painting,"Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criti- cism 45 (1987), 237-249. 5.

Now, it is easy for me to explain why I produced this last idea. My friend Ann Stokes Angus is a gifted potter whom I on occasion assisted in her work. She is the widow of the writer Adrian Stokes, whom in an earlier account I compared with Michael Fried.6 But of course these are merely private associa- tions. Since Courbet did not know Ann Stokes nor take an interest in pottery, Wheat Sifters is not about potting. That I owned some wonderful plates by Ann Stokes, which were destroyed by a careless boy a little older than the figure Courbet depicts looking into the ovenlike tarare, links the picture for me with the ideas of violence Fried discusses. Adrian Stokes's autobiographical books relate the creation of art to the birth of his children, and so for me those texts are richly associated with my thoughts of my daughter, born a few years after those plates were destroyed.7 But here we are moving very far from Wheat Sifters. These are thoughts in my mind, not an interpretation of Courbet's painting. Are Fried's interpretations any more objective than my associations? Someone under the spell of his theory may see these pictures as he does, but if that is the only reason to accept these interpretations, clearly they cannot be evidence for Fried's larger theory. It would be easy to parody his style of interpre- tation, which is worth doing not to be malicious but in order to understand the implicit principles of his argumentation.8 He sees a rosebush in The Hammock as bending "amorously over a sleeping . .. woman as if to embrace her" (197). If the bush is phallic, since it reaches only to the edge of the hammock, it has a long way to go before it gets to her body. Is it an image of failed desire? That Courbet loved swimming suggests to Fried that he identified with the dying trout in two late works, which show "some of the freest, most abstract application of paint in all Courbet's art" (250). Painted after Courbet's involvement in the commune of 1870, this imagery is naturally linked with the artist's "feelings of persecution and the collapse of his health" (250). Since the artist was imprisoned for allegedly leading the destruction of the Vendome Column, might we also read the horizontal fish in one picture, and the three vertical ones in the other as a commentary on that action? The dying fish refer to the bringing down of the vertical column, the cause of the collapse of Courbet's health. The painting of the three vertical fish must remind us of a crucifixion; indeed just as in that scene there is one bad thief and one good one, so here the fish on the right of the center one has fallen head downwards, separated from the two others who remain firmly upright - an unexpected com- position for an irreligious artist. 6.

This has always been the nightmare of art historians; if interpretation is not controlled by reference to the artist's intentions, then with ingenuity we can say anything about the picture. Mentioning the Vendome Column leads me to think of a later vertical structure in Paris memorialized in a haunting little Seurat, The Eiffel Tower. And since I saw that painting, which now is in San Francisco, on the morning of the day when I met Albert Elsen at Stanford University to look there at Rodin's Gates of Hell, mentioning it leads me to many thoughts about modernist art. I readily move from Courbet to Seurat and The Eiffel Tower to what Elsen told me about Rodin and the politics of modernist art. Insofar as the pieces of evidence for Fried's theory of Courbet's art consists of statements such as those I have cited, which individually can readily be questioned, what reason do they give us to believe that theory? Why is his interpretation any more visually convincing than my parody of it? Fried might not reject this line of argument. Maybe all interpretation of artworks is ulti- mately personal in these ways. Most art historians may repress awareness of this fact, which Fried, more honest than they, makes explicit. Then the very notion of art history as a science, a discipline capable of objectivity, collapses. Art historical interpretation is inescapably personal. Only someone who ap- proaches Courbet's pictures with Fried's conceptual framework will be prepared to see those paintings as he does. Nothing Fried says in these books gives reason to attribute such a very far reaching argument to him. But neither does he reject it entirely. In one case, at the very end of the book, Fried critically questions his own procedures. The horse's tail in Hunter on Horseback reminds him of "the painter-beholder's brush.... How persuaded," he asks, "am I by this interpretation?" (289). Not entirely, he allows. If this horse, who is standing on snow, were in water, then what are the shadows of his legs would be reflections. That suggests to Fried that this picture relates to Courbet's earlier images of water; after all "snow and water are the same substance" (289). The force of this counterfactual is hard to understand. Equally well: Were the horse bleeding from a gunshot wound, Hunter on Horseback would remind me of The Wheat Sifters, which suggests a fascinating connection between Courbet's "femininity" and ideas about violence. His analysis, Fried says, involves "an entire thematics of embodiedness and picture-making . . . a network of connections - of interpretations - it has re- quired all of this book to set in place" (290). Certainly his account must be judged as a whole, but insofar as each part of that whole may be questioned, why should the fact that all those parts are parts of a highly complex whole be reason to accept it? It is easy to think of an alternative explanation for the existence of this network of connections: they are all the product of Fried, who projects into Courbet's art these themes of embodiedness and picture-making. Whatever artwork he sees, he sees as avoiding theatricality. Fried's early career as art critic perhaps helps explain why he finds such personal interpretations so seductive. When in the 1960s he wrote about artists</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW ESSAYS 375 he knew personally, the painters Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, and Frank Stella and the sculptor Anthony Caro, he provided a highly complex theory about their work. His interpretation was influential then, and remains so; even now he is regularly denounced in the commercial art journals. Just as his analysis of Courbet may seem farfetched, so too his idea that Stella's early shaped canvases involved a critique of cubism and a rejection of "the stylistic premises implicit in" the abstract expressionist work of Willem de Kooning seemed sur- prising. Stella made shaped canvases with internal lines repeating the shape of the stretcher. Fried saw these as highly complex works. "The Cubists appear to have built their paintings out from the edge," he wrote; "in Stella's paintings structure is generated from the framing-edge in toward the center. "9 Fried attributes to the artist a sophisticated art historical awareness.10 One reason that Stella became famous was that Fried's theory made his work seem of great historical importance. Stella was presented by Fried as the successor to the cubists and the abstract expressionists. Because neither Stella nor these other artists wrote much about their own work, it was natural that Fried's became the canonical interpretation. This experience provided Fried, I am sug- gesting, support for his belief that such seemingly personal interpretations could gain acceptance. Nobody else had an interesting theory about these works; the artists Fried championed must have been flattered at the intensity of his interest in their work, and pleased by the art historical role he attributed to them. Fried must have gained a great deal of self-confidence from finding that these artists accepted his view of their art. But there are basic differences between writing about such living artists and dealing with historical figures. 1 ' Fried cannot appeal to Courbet for confirmation of his view; and since styles of Courbet-interpretation are established, an idiosyncratic account such as his will meet with resistance.12 This explanation of Fried's characteristic procedures does not tell us how to evaluate these books. Most art historians are not also art critics, and that may explain why they, unlike Fried, do not write personal interpretations. A more serious objection to Fried's work is that it depends upon what Gombrich calls 9. Michael Fried, Three American Painters (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), 12, 41. For a discussion of his analysis of Stella, with bibliography, see my Artwriting, chap. 3. 10. In his recent book Stella gives a very different view of his early work. The "paintings I made are completely acceptable as standard, normative abstract expressionist works." Working Space (Cambridge, Mass., 1986), 153. He does not explain why he came to view his paintings so differently from Fried. 11. My own experience as art critic gives me a different perspective on this problem. See my article written in collaboration with a painter, David Carrier and David Reed, "Tradition, Self Consciousness, Eclecticism," Arts 65 (1991), 44-49, and also my "David Reed: An Abstract Painter in the Age of Postmodernism," in Interpreting Contemporary Art, ed. S. Bann and W. Allen (London, 1991). 12. In thus explaining why most art historians will have problems with Fried's writing, I am not presenting my own view of how art history works. My view is that for unFriedian reasons art history would do well to give up its concern with the artist's intentions; see my Principles of Art History Writing (University Park, Pa., 1991).</page><page sequence="9">376 REVIEW ESSAYS a label of exclusion.'3 In Woelfflin's Principles of Art History, which contrasts the classical with the baroque, for example, the baroque is not a style with a self-sufficient existence, but only what is not classical. "His polarities," Gom- brich argues, "are not true polarities at all." The classical remains the hidden norm. Analogously, when Fried distinguishes theatrical from antitheatrical art, the antitheatrical remains his hidden norm. Gombrich claims that Woelfflin's failure to recognize this point makes his theory of the development from the classical to the baroque vacuous. Woelffilin wants to explain why Caravaggio differs from Raphael. 14 Caravaggio wanted to paint differently from Raphael, but "if we want to see Raphael in his own terms" we cannot think that he wanted to be unlike Caravaggio; "He cannot have rejected what he never knew." Fried need not accept this argument as a compel- ling criticism of his work. For Gombrich explicitly says that his problem is that categories of exclusion prevent the historian from appealing to the artist's intentions; and Fried does not need to do that. What is true, as Gombrich hints, is that such binary oppositions implicitly appeal to a moralizing distinction between good and bad. Woelfflin's distinction between the classical and the baroque, like Fried's between antitheatrical and theatrical art, amounts to a distinction between what is good, and what is less good.'5 Any such moralizing critic needs to explain why the tradition which he calls "not good" is not good. And so it is strange that Fried provides no explanation of why art which appeals to the presence of the viewer is (relatively) inferior to that antitheatrical work which does not. Fried's most explicit statement of his objections to theatrical visual art appears in his "Art and Objecthood" (1967).16 Part, but not all, that he says there about antitheatrical works of the 1960s can apply to the paintings of Courbet and Eakins. Every artist seeks to control what he or she creates; insofar as spectators can undercut that control, seeing the work differently according to the position they take up before it, the artist has given up a measure of control over his own work. With old master art, this may not be important; usually a painting or sculpture presents the same composition from any normal viewing position. But when Marcel Duchamp and the various 1960s artists rejected traditional ideas of artmaking, they also challenged this ideal of composition. Duchamp's ready- made Fountain, a urinal rotated ninety degrees, and Andy Warhol's Brillo Box are ordinary objects become artworks because they are placed in a museum 13. E. H. Gombrich, "Norm and Form," reprinted in his Norm and Form (London, 1966), 81- 98, quotation on 93. 14. This is Gombrich's example, "Norm and Form," 90; like most art historians of his generation, Woelfflin had relatively little interest in Caravaggio, who is briefly discussed in one of his books. 15. Perhaps it is revealing that Fried characterizes what for him is the superior kind of art by what it rejects. The greater antitheatrical art refuses to recognize the presence of the spectator. One question worth pursuing is whether this characterization could be restated in a positive way; might we say that antitheatrical artworks are self-sufficient? 16.

This paragraph restates part of the argument of my Artwriting, chap. 3.</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW ESSAYS 377 setting. They are theatrical artworks. How we view them depends upon where we place ourselves in relation to them. This reading of Fried's reasoning is necessarily highly speculative, for he does not spell it out in easily paraphrased terms. "We are all literalists most or all of our lives. Presentness is grace."`7 Fried's language here suggests that at bottom his objection to theatrical art involves a secular reading of such theological language. Perhaps that is why "Art and Objecthood" begins with a quotation describing Jonathan Edwards's speculations about how we might see God cre- ating the world. From God's viewpoint, nothing appears in the way in which we mere mortals view theatrical art; God is not a mere spectator on His world. It may seem odd to understand 1960s American art in these quasi-theological terms. What may be odder is Fried's belief that these same concerns with theatri- cality appear also in art of earlier periods. In Absorption and Theatricality he argues at length that eighteenth-century ideas about the theater played an important role in how painting was understood in the age of Diderot. This provides a way of anchoring his argument in the culture of the time. Fried is spelling out in his vocabulary ideas implicit in Diderot's criticism, which earlier commentators read differently. As Fried reads him, Diderot plays in the late eighteenth century something of the role Fried himself played in the 1960s. But when Fried comes to Courbet and Eakins, he says less about how theatricality is thought about in the larger culture. The greatest contemporary critic, Baude- laire, wrote little about Courbet, whom he knew but did not admire; and what that artist's champions wrote offers little support for Fried's reading. Fried's argument in these books is not supported by direct historical evidence. Baude- laire, he argues, failed to recognize "that Courbet's paintings are eminently imaginative" (5) in the poet's sense of that word. Suppose that Fried's argument were plausible. What is unclear, still, is why antitheatrical paintings are aesthetically significant. Courbet's goal, treating the spectator as if he or she were not present, is obviously impossible to achieve. Why then should we admire him for trying to achieve what we and he know to be impossible? I can imagine answers to this question, but it would be out of place to present them in a review, for they can draw little support from Courbet's Realism. It is as if Fried is as far inside his texts as he imagines Courbet to be within his paintings, so that he feels no need to discuss what, for a sympathetic reader, is a very obvious question. This lack of an explanation of the value of theatrical art may be connected with another seeming omission. Since Fried discusses the changing nature of the self as it is represented in art, what we might expect from him is an account of the relationship between art history and broader social history. A Marxist might argue that the difference between Greuze's appeal to the beholder before the 1789 revolution and Courbet's is bound up with the changes in the larger society. A formalist art historian will not provide such a theory; formalists treat 17. Fried, "Art and Objecthood," 147.</page><page sequence="11">378 REVIEW ESSAYS the evolution of art as a self-sufficient process. Among art critics, Fried is identified as a formalist. In 1965, referring to the young Marx and Georg Lu- kaics, he wrote of the ideal of a perpetual revolution, "not a political revolution but a revolution in which painting would criticize itself."' That seems a curious apolitical reading of a political theory, a formalist way of aestheticizing the idea of revolution. Fried now denies (46, 305) that he is a formalist. Perhaps he has not changed his views, for in part this involves mere verbal debate. Sometimes formalism is identified as the view that we can look at paintings without identifying what they depict. Fried denies that he is a formalist in that sense. That is relatively uninteresting, for few historians are formalists in that sense. The more plausible view is that a formalist is an historian who treats the artwork apart from its social or political context. "I want no part," Fried says, of "the repudiation of the political in the name of the esthetic" (255). But what then does his analysis of Courbet's spectator-beholder amount to in political terms? Is the seemingly obvious sexism of Courbet's female nudes undercut by the artist's display of his femininity, as Fried would reconstruct it? Fried gives no ready answer to this question. Like a formalist art historian, Fried tells a story of Courbet's develop- ment as an essentially self-sufficient process, not much influenced by the political events in which the artist participated. But whether this means that antitheatrical art is linked, in some way Fried has not yet indicated, with social history is impossible to determine. "At every turn," the most interesting commentator on Fried's account of Eakins observes, "Fried brings himself into the discourse."'9 Normal art historians write "we," appealing to the consensus which their work reflects; Fried tends to write "I,," acknowledging that his claims will arouse controversy among his colleagues. Some of the difficulties of this book are intimately bound up with Fried's rejec- tion of the usual standards of art historical argumentation. It is understandable that so original a commentator will be unwilling to interrupt the flow of his account by prolonged discussion of the views of earlier writers. But when he complains that Linda Nochlin's essay on Courbet's The Painter's Studio employs "a farrago of quotations" (324), it is easy to apply the same phrase to some portions of his own text, which includes scattered remarks on such fashionable topics as Foucault on the gaze, Derrida on frames, and Barthes on photography. Like most of us, Fried likes to show that he is keeping up with his reading, but since his argument does not really depend on these writers, he weakens his account with these distracting references. The one rival interpreter Fried ex- presses great respect for is T. J. Clark; "I regard [his] Image of the People as 18. Fried, Three American Painters, 8. 19.

But since in the body of his text (116-118) Fried offers a highly critical account of Clark's work, it is unclear whether he thinks that such different interpretations of the pictures are possible, or, rather, believes that Clark's analysis is interesting, but fundamentally flawed. I owe a great intellectual debt to Professor Fried, whom I have never met and never expect to meet.21 Had I not read and reread his daring works, I never would have acquired the intellectual courage needed to write my own texts, which at many points borrow explicitly from his. This is one reason I respond to his work in highly personal ways. It is easy for me to be critical about his writing, especially when it disappoints me. But it is natural, I believe, that even those who do not have this personal relation with his work, respond differently to it than to normal art history. Much is to be learned about how we respond to other books which go against our accustomed ways of thinking. Consider three. Holy Blood, Holy Grail proposes a radical revisionist theory of European history.22 The treasury of the Cathars, the victims of the thirteenth-century Albigensian Crusade, was not material goods, but some great secrets: Jesus was married to Magdalen; their children fled to the South of France; the Knights Templar were their descendants. And so the church has been blackmailed by those who know this secret. Much of European history, and cultural history, enters into the analysis. Nicolas Poussin, who learned something of the secret from Nicolas Fouquet, shows in The Arcadian Shepherds a scene from the territory of the Templars.23 The phrase on the tomb in that painting, "et in arcadia ego" is an anagram: "I trego arcana dei" (Begone! I conceal the secrets of God). Like astrology, this is a subject that attracts many people fascinated by obsessiveness and secrecy. In a bookstore in southern France I found an entire section devoted to Catharism. I am sure that historians view such books in the same way as astronomers view texts on astrology. Lacking the knowledge needed to criticize this book, I find myself fascinated by the paranoid fantasy that the usual histories are all wrong. Charles Bouleau's The Painter's Secret Geometry is devoted to "a search for the formulae that have guided, over the centuries, the distribution of the various plastic elements."24 His obsessive analysis traces complex patterns of lines and 20.

Since, as Bouleau indicates, theoreticians explicitly discussed the golden section, there is reason to believe that some artists did use these tech- niques. What then seems unconvincing, still, about a book filled with plates like one in which no less than seventeen straight lines are overlaid on Caravaggio's Entombment, is the sense that with a little ingenuity, almost any painting, good or bad, could be reduced to such a maze of lines. Bouleau provides a comprehensive analysis, but it is hard to believe that such an account possesses any explanatory value. Sidney Geist's Interpreting Cezanne, a recent book mentioned in passing by Fried, offers an equally obsessive analysis.25 His thesis is that Cezanne's paintings are filled with hidden images, many sexual, often involving word puns. In The Railroad Cutting, for example, a railroad hut by the cutting stands "for the fetus in the womb" of Cezanne's "female companion"; in The Black Clock, her name appears, reversed, in the folds of the tablecloth. Like Bouleau, Geist provides a comprehensive analysis: "Cezanne's imagination eroticizes every- thing it touches." Some reviewers admired this book; I did not, for I thought its analysis farfetched and reductive.26 But here again, as with Holy Blood, Holy Grail or The Painter's Secret Geometry, is such criticism entirely fair? If these authors get some points of detail wrong, or occasionally make errors, that is only to be expected in books which are highly original. When a writer employs familiar standards of argu- mentation, we know how to evaluate their work. When the goal is to change those standards, evaluation is more difficult. Like Fried, Bouleau and Geist are original and they provide a comprehensive analysis dealing with many examples. But the reader who believes that their approaches are unproductive is not likely to think this reason to admire their work. Like the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, they aim to change our conception of what counts as the material for a history. If we accept the view of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, then the usual accounts of the facts of European history focus on the wrong questions, looking for the wrong connections; if we follow Bouleau, then the key to composition of European painting lies right before our eyes, in those patterns he presents. Fried's similar aim is to change our conception of what counts as an interpreta- tion of artworks. If we believe him, then the usual accounts of Courbet and Eakins are fundamentally mistaken. It is hard to find some noncircular way of showing that Bouleau and Geist adopt a mistaken methodology. The critic of Fried faces the same problem. In one way, I grant, it would be misleading to treat Fried as akin to these marginal figures. Because their books are not taken seriously, their claims do not receive much debate. Since he is famous, his work does receive attention. But since his ambition is to challenge the standards of normal art historical 25.

If Fried's work provides a viable approach, then art historians will have to change their methodology.27 What is fascinating about his books is that if their arguments are at all correct, then everything everyone else has said about Courbet and Eakins is beside the point. What is frustrating about them is that Fried's argu- ment is so difficult to evaluate. This is why I find it hard to adopt a stable view of Fried's argument. Were Fried an imaginative writer who presented what he identified as a fictional narrative, I would admire him without reserve. It is only because he claims to be an art historian that I find his arguments troubling. What is fascinating and frustrating about these books is that the argument is hard to respond to in an objective way. Like Courbet's painting as Fried inter- prets it, Courbet's Realism leaves no place for the reader who would seek to stand outside of the text. DAVID CARRIER Carnegie Mellon University 27. This portion of my review owes much to Paul Barolsky, who has argued in our correspon- dence that my focus on the need for originality in art history provides a distorted perspective on that discipline.</page></plain_text>
