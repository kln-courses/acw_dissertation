He estimates the significance of Vico's thought in terms of its kinship with and anticipation of nineteenth- and twentieth-century thought rather than its opposition to and break with pre- eighteenth-century or traditional thought. Leon Pompa also approaches Vico from the point of view of the present, and like Berlin he takes as his central theme Vico's doctrine of knowledge or science. Both orient their interpreta- tions around recent discussions of the methodology and epistemology of the natural and historical (humanistic) sciences. Pompa, however, is less con- cerned with giving comparisons and contrasts to other philosophical ideas and figures.2 His book is thus less historical and erudite and more systematic and abstract. Like Berlin, Fellmann emphasizes the historical relationships of Vico's ideas with those of other thinkers (mainly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries), and is less concerned than Pompa with showing the systematic unity of the Scienza Nuova. But in contrast to both Berlin and Pompa, Fellmann takes as his major theme Vico's metaphysical Axiom that der Mensch macht die Geschichte, to which he subordinates his discussion of Vico's methodology and epistemology. In his Introduction, Berlin lists the following as the chief "live issues" in Vico's thought. (1) "The nature of man" is not "static and unalterable or even unaltered" (xvi). (2) "That those who make or create something can understand it as mere observers of it cannot" (xvi). (3) Knowledge in natural science is fundamentally different from knowledge in the humanities (history). The former is "observation of the external world," while the latter is knowledge from the "inside" of human activities, purposes, and atti- tudes, a knowledge in which men are the "makers, actors and observers in one" (xvii). (4) The formulation of "the concept of a culture," i.e., "a 1 Berlin's essay on Vico occupies about three-fourths (142 pages) of his book. An earlier shorter version was published in Art and Ideas in Eighteenth Century Italy, Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura (Rome, 1960). 2 Cf.

(5) Human historical creatidns are "natural forms of self- expression, of communication with other human beings or with God" (xviii). (6) Works of art should not be interpreted according to "timeless principles and standards," but according to their place in a particular culture (xix). (7) The conception of a distinct form of knowledge, knowledge by "recon- structive imagination" or fantasia, i.e., the "'entering' into the. mental life of other cultures" (xix).3 The major theme of Berlin's interpretation is Vico's theory of knowledge [cf. (2), (3) and (7) above]. In particular, Berlin focusses on what he takes to be Vico's basic distinction between knowledge in the Geisteswissen- schaften and knowledge in the Naturwissenschaften.4 According to Berlin, to the three traditional kinds of knowledge-metaphysical-theological (rational intuition and faith), rational deduction, and empirical observation-Vico added a fourth:5 "self-knowledge." The latter is historical knowledge, i.e., "knowledge of activities of which we, the knowing subjects, are ourselves the authors, endowed with motives, purposes and a continuous social life, which we understand, as it were, from inside" (21-22). Here we know what it is to be something, not merely to look like or behave like something (23). Human beings cannot know what it is like to be a tree, but they can know what it is to have a mind or to be human (25). According to Berlin, this special kind of self-knowledge by empathetic "entering into" the minds of others is the essential meaning of Vico's identification of knowing and making. He thus affirms that Vico's "truly revolutionary move is the application of the verum/factum principle to the study of history" (26).6 Here too is found the essence of Vico's opposition to Cartesian rationalism and naturalism. Carte- sian knowledge implies that knowledge of man is possible only to the extent to which man is like the non-human world. Thus, all explanation of human characteristics and behavior is ultimately expressed in non-human, or purely naturalistic, terms. Hence Cartesianism is the inverse of anthropomorphism, for where the latter tries to know the non-human by assimilating it to the human (cf. SN 180-2, 375), the former tries to know the human by assimilat- ing it to the non-human. Each is a form of reductionism, although each moves in a different direction. Berlin argues that Vico's fourth kind of knowledge avoids this reductionism, for it shows the possibility of a knowl- 3 Elsewhere Berlin affirms that "Vico's claim to originality" consists in "his theories of the nature and development of the human mind, culture, society and human history" and a "novel theory of knowledge" (3). He calls the former a "'phenomenology' of human experience and activity" (35). 4 The former is knowledge from the "inside" (Verstehen), the latter knowledge from the "outside" (Wissen) (24). "In history we are the actors; in the natural sciences mere spectators. This is the doctrine, above others, on which Vico's claim to immortality must rest" (67). 5 Cf. Berlin's somewhat different list of the types of knowledge on pp. 105-06 and discussed below. 6 Here Berlin follows Croce's influential interpretation. Cf.

(1), (4) and (7) above]. Berlin claims that what "marks the birth of full-fledged modern historicism" is Vico's method of "abstracting what is common to various phases of a culture" in order to reveal their "unalterable inner pattern" (36). This method is linked, of course, with Vico's doctrine that man's nature does not consist in "some unaltering static 'core' " but in "the flux itself" of history (37), "the actual process of his development" (65). This implies that human nature has no "fixed, timeless goals" (114) and that "the notion of absolute standards" in morality and aesthetics must be rejected (41). Here we find the link between Berlin's interpretation of Vico's epistemology of history and his historicist interpretation of Vico's doctrine of human nature. For the denial of a universal and permanent human nature is merely the metaphysical correlate of the denial that knowledge of what is human, i.e., historical knowledge, involves universality and permanence. In both the metaphysical and epistemological realms, particularity and change constitute the essence of the human and the historical. Indeed, the human and the historical ultimately coincide into one. Pompa states that his book "is intended both to offer an interpretation of the main philosophical theories in Vico's Scienza Nuova and to serve as an analytic introduction to its text" (ix). More specifically, he attempts "to produce an account of the relative status and function of the principal elements involved in Vico's science" (x-xi). According to Pompa, Vico tries to do two things: "to reconstruct the histories of some of the principal ancient nations known to him; and to give some account of the main philosophical and theoretical presuppositions involved in this reconstruction" (1). In other words, Vico's Scienza Nuova is essentially an attempt to lay the foundations of a scientific history, one which will be both new and superior to all previous histories (3).8 Vico's new foundation rests on three kinds of principles: (a) philosophical (metaphysical and epsitemological) principles, (b) historico-sociological theories, and (c) theories about historio- graphical method. In addition to these are (d) particular historical state- ments and accounts. Pompa claims that (a) and (c) correspond to the "general" Elements, and (b) and (d) to the "particular" Elements in Book I, Section II of the Scienza Nuova (4). He argues that Vico does not confuse or conflate the general sociological theories with particular historical state- ments, but rather tries to show they are interdependent (5).9 "On this view, 7 Vico's humanism (or anti-naturalism), together with his historicism and pluralism, seem to be the chief reasons for Berlin's obvious interest in and sympathy with his thought. 8 "... Vico's work is largely concerned with the questions how to understand and establish the truth in human history" (6). "Vico's thought itself begins and ends" with "the problem of history" (170). 9 This argument is in effect a critique of Croces claim that one of the major causes of the oscuritd of the Scienza Nuova is Vico's confusion of tre ordini di richerche: filosofiche, storiche ed empiriche and that he therefore mixes together</page><page sequence="4">514 JAMES C. MORRISON history and sociology can be proper objects of knowledge only when con- ceived in such a way as to bring mutual support to each other, while the task of metaphysics is to explicate the basic categories which will allow this to be done" (6). Vico's metaphysics consists essentially in the doctrine that "the world of civil society has certainly been made by men" and his epistemology in the doctrine that "its principles are therefore to be recovered within the modifica- tions of our own human mind" (16; cf. 72).10 Pompa emphasizes that Vico's epistemology presupposes his metaphysics (16), for historical knowledge is possible only because all men share the same nature (41). Vico calls this universal human nature "common sense." Common sense consists of the belief in providence, the need to moderate the passions, and the immortality of the soul, which make up what Vico calls the three "principles" of the Scienza Nuova (31). Common sense grounds "the generic identity of the historian with his subject, i.e. of man as historian with man as historical agent" (35; cf. 183).1 Vico's notion of science as knowledge of "what is universal and eternal" (SN 163) and of the causes of things (SN 180-2, 375)12 implies the need to discover "the empirical laws which determine the actual behavior of things" (85). These laws make up what Vico calls "the ideal eternal history" and provide the key to Vico's attempt to unite philosophy and history ("philology") by verifying the latter by the former and certifying the former by the latter (cf. 101).13 Pompa calls Vico's ideal eternal history an "empirical theory" but says that it is "deductive in form." It is "empirically confirmable through the facts whose interpretation it makes possible; and if it is thus confirmed its propositions assume the status of laws" (92). He argues that the ideal eternal history is not a product of inductive reasoning from given historical facts because "it makes possible the correct interpretation of historical evidence" and thus the establishment of historical fact (102). The ideal eternal history is a product of "philosophical reflec- tion or reasoning" (102), a "theoretical construction" (104) which provides the link between Vico's philosophy and scientific history. The ideal eternal history thus has "two dimensions," one consisting of empirical descriptions of the social institutions of a given historical age, the other a theory about the historical laws of the causes of their development (112). una filosofia dello spirito, una storia (o gruppo di storie), e una scienza sociale. Croce, op. cit., 37. 10 In this crucial passage (SN 331) Pompa modifies the Bergin &amp; Fisch transla- tion by rendering ritruovare as "recovered" rather than "found." 11 Despite his emphasis on common sense as the ground of the universality and sameness of man's nature-a crucial point that Berlin seems to miss- Pompa follows Berlin in emphasizing also Vico's historicist doctrine that "human nature itself may develop in history" (45-46). For the history of institutions and the history of human nature are "mutually conditioning aspects of a single his- torical process" (49). 12 This is another point which Berlin seems to miss or neglect. Cf. note 11 above. 13 The result of this unification is precisely what Vico means by his "new science" (SN 138-40).</page><page sequence="5">THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF VICO 515 Pompa notes that Vico's new science, as he has interpreted it, shows a "close parallel with the hypothetico-deductive method" (148). The main difference is that Vico's eternal history cannot (according to Pompa) be simply confirmed inductively by "an external historical reality," since "the epistemological status of the historical world is precisely what requires to be established" (152).14 Nevertheless, Pompa does place Vico's new science much closer to the natural sciences than does Berlin. Berlin emphasizes the uniqueness of historical knowledge and the special role of imaginative insight in contrast to natural-scientific knowledge and its use of rational deduction, empirical observation, and laws. Pompa explicitly criticizes Ber- lin's theory of imaginative insight15 on the ground that it seems to dispense with the need for "empirical evidence."16 He argues that Berlin's interpreta- tion also "seems to conflate coscienza with scienza" (160). Imaginative insight or empathy is a kind of coscienza, and the mere consciousness of one's own or other's mental states is not the same as a science (scienza) of them. Scienza always implies universality and hence causal laws. Pompa insists that for Vico "the whole weight of explanation is thrown upon the historical and social conditions in which men find themselves," rather than a "direct insight" into the "inner states" of individuals (160-1). In contrast to Berlin, Pompa finds the peculiarity of the knowledge constituting Vico's new science not in its being "internal" rather than "external," and in its dispensing with explanation by means of universal causal laws, but rather in its uniting the elements of universal law and empirical observation by means of "reflection." History must be pursued scientifically, that is, involve both theories (philo- sophical and empirical) and direct empirical observation. But it must also involve "a certain kind of human or reflective insight" (176; cf. 185). This capacity of the human knower of human (rather than natural) things to reflect on himself and on the development of his own mind is what adds the greater degree of "intelligibility" that Vico claims his own science of history has to natural science.17 And it is just this element that Berlin is emphasizing. But Pompa thinks Berlin goes wrong by overemphasizing it to the exclusion of the scientific element and thus failing to see the equally essential role of theory and law. The crucial-and important-difference between Berlin and Pompa's interpretations of Vico's conception of knowledge and science may be sum- marized briefly as follows. According to Berlin, Vico's new science consists of a special kind of knowledge which is not simply the result of uniting philosophy and history but is something irreducible and sui generis. In Berlin's (second) list of the four types of knowledge distinguished by Vico, the first and third types are both scienza, and the second and fourth types are 14 Pompa insists that there is no "vicious circle" in this view (cf. 152-53). 15 Pompa's book appeared just after Berlin's (cf. Berlin's Preface), so that his knowledge of Berlin's views is based mainly on the latter's earlier essay on Vico (cf. note 1 above). Fellmann does not refer explicitly to either Berlin or Pompa. 16 This criticism is not completely correct. Cf. Berlin, 29 and above. 17 Pompa says that precisely this claim to greater intelligibility is "the most fundamental and yet most difficult in the Scienza Nuova" (164).</page><page sequence="6">516 JAMES C. MORRISON coscienza. The fourth type is what Berlin calls "inner" knowledge or historical knowledge in the strict sense (105-6). According to Pompa, however, Vico's new science is not historical knowledge as opposed to scientific knowl- edge, but precisely scientific knowledge of the historical: a scientific history. It is an attempt to show that universal knowledge of historical fact is pos- sible by bringing historical particulars (the "certain") under universal laws (the "true") (cf. SN 138-40). It is precisely this task which Vico's ideal eternal history is intended to accomplish. Although Berlin says that the ideal eternal history is "the idee maitresse of [Vico's] whole thought," he also says (on the same page) that Vico's "cyclical pattern" of history is "the least interesting, plausible, and original of his views" (64).18 This conclusion is no doubt largely motivated by Berlin's belief that the ideal eternal history is either a metaphysical hypostatization or a second-order empirical general- ization (cf. 68). Thus, while Berlin thinks that the Scienza Nuova is compar- able to the meta-histories of Spengler or Toynbee, Pompa claims that Vico's problem is precisely that of determining the conditions for the establishment of first-order historical truths (cf. 172-73). If he is right, the customary characterization of the Scienza Nuova as a "philosophy of history" (a term which Vico himself never uses at all) must be radically rethought. As indicated by the title, the central theme of Fellmann's book is Vico's doctrine that der Mensch macht die Geschichte.19 His Leitfrage is eine Be- standsaufnahme derjenigen Bereiche, in denen Vico die geschichtsbildende Tdtigkeit des Menschen am Werke sieht (8). Fellmann develops his interpre- tation of Vico's Scienza Nuova in terms of several Thesen (corresponding to Chapters I-V of his book). (a) The mythical religions created by men are the beginning of all human history (12). (b) The making of history means the production of a vortheoretischen Welt lebensweltlichpraktischen Kiinste (13). (c) Mythical religions are the basis of human freedom and thus of law and the state (15). (d) Man produces his geschichtliche Natur in and through producing the Kulturwelt (15-6). (e) Machen von Geschichte impliziert ihre Erkennbarkeit, insofern die Menschen in den Erzeugungen des Geistes immer schon seine Geschichte erzdhlen (17). Fellmann emphasizes that Vico's affirmation that man makes history implies the denial of two other views, one traditional and the other modern. The traditional view is that of the Geschichtstheologie, according to which God makes history (10). This view is linked with the belief in a trans- cendent providence manifested in God's revelation to man and gives to the Jewish and Christian religions and peoples the central place in history. Vico replaces the transcendent providence of religious tradition with the philo- sophical concept of the Gesetzmdssigkeit of history or the Diskrepanz von 18 In another passage, Berlin complains that Vico's "cyclical view of human history ... is probably the best known and the least valuable among his achieve- ments" (4). 19 Although Fellmann calls this doctrine das Vico-Axiom, Vico himself does not call it an "axiom." The doctrine is stated in the section entitled "Principles" (SN 331), while Vico's own axioms are stated in the preceding section entitled "Elements" (SN 120-326).</page><page sequence="7">THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF VICO 517 Absicht und Wirkung in historical action (23, 92).20 He replaces divine Ofenbarung by Mythos or die geschichtsbildende Funktion of the human mind (25). Thus, the traditional Christian view (represented by Bossuet) that pagan myths are a corrupted form of divine revelation (26,28) is refuted by Vico's doctrine of the universal myth-making capacity of man which constitutes the primordial creative capacity of the human mind and thus the primordial capacity of man to make his own history. Vico's axiom there- fore implies that history is ultimately and primarily Geistesgeschichte. In this way, Vico effects the transition from Geschichtstheologie-where God's ac- tivity is central-to Geschichtsphilosophie-where man's creativity is central. Man, not God, is the true Subjekt der Geschichte (72). Furthermore, it is precisely man's creative power of myth-making that serves as the condition for the possibility of his own development, i.e., his making of himself. The human mind, in itself indefinit, becomes determinate in and through man's creation of his own historical and social institutions. Man's Natur thereby becomes his wahre, historische Natur (111). Since myth and metaphor are die gemeinsame Grundfigur der Produktivitdt des menschlichen Geistes (176), poetry-myth replaces philosophy-science as the defining trait of human nature. Man the rational animal becomes man the poetic animal. The Vichian Ingenium replaces the Cartesian Ratio (174). By making myth and metaphor the Vorform rationaler begrifflicher Erkenntnis (38), Vico weakens the power of Cartesian rationalism by tracing the historical development of reason from sense and imagination, i.e., of the human from the sub-human. In other words, Vico undermines Cartesianism by showing the pre-rational conditions for the possibility of rational thought, science, and technique. While Descartes emphasizes der Fortschritt als zunehmende technische Regulierung aller Lebensbereiche (53), Vico emphasizes die Entwicklung der Kultur and man's emergence in history as eines verniinftigen Wesens (124).21 This brings us to the second (modern) doctrine denied by Vico's axiom that man makes history. According to Fellmann, Vico's axiom should not be understood as the Autonomiethese, i.e., the doctrine sowohl der technischen Machbarkeit von Geschichte als auch der Rationalisierbarkeit politischen Handelns (7). The Autonomiethese is exemplified primarily by Descartes and Hobbes. Vico refutes das kartesische Ideal der Methodisierung by re- placing it with die sinnliche Produktivitdt des Geistes (82), and the Hobbesian reduction of politics to einen voluntarischen Akt of individuals by replacing 20 While Fellmann gives an immanentist interpretation of Vico's notion of providence, Berlin affirms Vico's "Catholic piety" (11), insists that "there is no reason for thinking that he is necessarily insincere" (43, note 3), and that "it was a genuinely devout Christian who wrote the Scienza Nuova" (30). Pompa, however, is much closer to Fellmann on this issue, for he admits that although "Vico's personal beliefs" might be Christian, "it is impossible to construe his doctrines to be in accordance with the orthodox theology of the time" (61) and that the notion of a "transcendent" providence is inessential to Vico's main argument (58). 21 Here, of course, is another version of the opposition of the Naturwissen- schaften and the Geisteswissenschaften emphasized by Berlin in his interpretation of the Scienza Nuova.</page><page sequence="8">518 JAMES C. MORRISON it with the conception of the development of human cultures and states as a natiirlichen Prozess (88). Human freedom, and thus the mastery of his- tory, are limited by the given structures or laws which define the course of the historical process, i.e., the ideal eternal history.22 In other words, the latter determines the framework within which historical action and freedom are possible and take place. Man's making of history and of himself is therefore radically finite. Each of the three books discussed above shows much sympathy and admiration for Vico's thought. They also bear witness to the vigorous and widespread revival of interest in Vico which has been gaining momentum in recent years throughout the world. As these interpretations remind us, Vico's thought is astonishingly rich, original, and insightful. None of them can be considered the (long-awaited) definitive interpretation of Vico's Scienza Nuova, nor, indeed, does any make this claim. Pompa's book, despite its abstractness and relative difficulty, seems to us more significant from a philosophical-systematic point of view, and should also, we suspect, arouse the most controversy. However, the erudite and insightful historical refer- ences of Berlin and Fellmann are also of interest and importance. Though these authors are not always in complete agreement about the meaning of Vico's text, they do complement one another and should be required reading for all serious students of Vico's thought. It is hoped that they will also contribute to giving Vico his rightful place among the few great foundational thinkers in modern philosophy. Such a place is a very high one indeed, and second to only a very few. University of Toronto. 22 Like Pompa, Fellmann sees the ideal eternal history as a Hypothese, um die Fakten der Uberlieferung zu 'lesen'. When this "reading" is successful, the hypothesis ceases to be a blossen Hypothese and becomes eine 'wahre Hypothese' (149).</page></plain_text>
