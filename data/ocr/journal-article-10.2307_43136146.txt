<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Double Cono√≠dal-drilled Pipe Bowl Harry E. Motsinger, D.D.S. Indianapolis, Indiana The term, double-conoidal, refers to the outstanding morphologic feature of these simple pipe .bowls. Two cone- shaped excavations were drilled, rough- ly at right angles, into a block of some suitable material. The larger of these excavations, or openings, became the receptacle in which the tobacco was placed, while the smaller opening was for the insertion of a stem. Both of the specimens in the accom- panying illustration bear evidence of the manner of their construction in the drill scratches or grooves that are vis- ible on the inner walls of the bowls and stem holes. The material from which the small- est specimen was made is red catinite, an argillaceous stone, or indurated clay, not native to Indiana. This spec- imen was found while surface hunting over a large village site near Indian- apolis in Marion County, Indiana. Decoration on this pipe bowl consists of notches on the lip of the bowl and vertical scratches or light grooves on the sides and back of the bowl. A cross was scratched on the base of the bowl. The material from which the largest specimen was made is an un-banded gray slate native of Indiana. This specimen was found on a village site in Polk Township, Washington County, Indiana. Decoration on this pipe bowl consists of rather deep horizontal grooves on the sides, back, and front; and grooves across the base parallel to the width dimension. While these pipes do not begin to compare in esthetic quality with the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic pipes of the Hopewell culture, still they are, from the simplicity of their construc- tion, a very interesting relic of the American Indian.
