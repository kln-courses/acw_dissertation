<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNDIFFERENTIATED BUNNIES: SETTING PSYCHIC BOUNDARIES IN THE ANIMAL STORIES OF BEATRIX POTTER, JACK LONDON, AND ERNEST SETON W.C. HARRIS The Johns Hopkins University In his foreword to Famous Animal Stories (1932), Ernest Thompson Seton enumerates the "four well-marked types of Animal Story": the myth, the fable, the animal fairy tale, and the "literally true" animal story (v). But when Seton defines these "types," he threatens the very distinctions he has made. What, for instance, is the difference between a fable, in which animals are "human beings going around in Animal forms," and an animal fairy tale, in which an animal has "the mind of a human being"? How can one distinguish between animals who "think and talk like human beings, but live their lives somewhat like Animals" and animals who "perceive, reason, and suffer as a man would do, although otherwise living the life of an Animal"? In both cases there seems to be no substantive and thus no categorical difference. What makes Seton's categories so fragile is the problematic notion of distinction, or (as Seton puts it) the "well-marked." The problem is not just setting boundaries that cannot be crossed and re-drawn, but drawing such lines in the first place. The instability of Seton's categorical distinctions leads one to question the mechanics of differentiation, if not the very feasibility of making such distinctions. The problem of the "well-marked" is especially prominent in one of Seton's own animal stories, "Wully, the Story of a Yaller Dog" (1898). As the story of a tame animal gone wild, "Wully" problematizes one obvious distinction: the "well-marked" line that differentiates man and beast, savage and civilized. But more is at stake than Seton's Darwinist platitude that "we and the beasts are kin" (Famous 11). The force of Seton's identifying with "the beasts" rests upon a distinction's having been made in the first place: the discrimination of himself as not a beast. Victorian Review 23.1 (Summer 1997)</page><page sequence="2">W.C. HARRIS 63 Before one can identify with anyone or anything, he must first differentiate himself. Otherwise there is no "I" to do the identifying. Even if we can agree that identification presupposes the drawing of some distinction, it is far from clear, in the following animal stories, how one arrives at the first step of differentiating the self from everything else, how one distinguishes any "I" at all. If Seton does not explicitly state that animal stories are about psychic differentiation, such a statement is implicit in his own efforts both to differentiate between animal story subgenres and to explain the psychological value of some of those stories. Seton praises the "literally true" animal story because it "aims to convey an accurate idea of the Animal's life and behavior, its mental processes, its trials and its methods of meeting each successive stress, in the great struggle that all take part in .. ." (Famous v). "Literally true" animal stories like Seton's own "Wully" compensate for what he views as the deficiency of the animal fairy tale ? that is, its having "little relation to life, and no value whatsoever*as psychology" (v). Animal stories that are of "value" have a "relation to life," which for Seton is synonymous with being "of use as psychology." The phrase "relation to life" does not seem to refer simply to human life ? in the obvious sense that animal stories, like works of art in general, are held to be about, or say something about, their creators. The "literally true" animal story has a "relation to life" for the same reason it is "of use as psychology": the animal's struggle is not the struggle of the human species but of the psyche (which is imagined as interspecies). "Wully" is not alone in its concern with the mechanics of self-differentiation. Both Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) and Jack London's The Call of the Wild (1903) depict boundary-marking as a means of differentiating, not man and beast, not species, but selves. A comparison of these three texts suggests that animal stories are psychological because they are? about psychic differentiation, about telling "out there" from "in here," about comprehending our own story before we can tell others our story ? indeed, before we can tell any other story. A psychological reading of animal stories is hardly original at this point. A lot of energy has been spent trying to figure out why people write animal stories. Most of the answers to this question have a psychological tinge. Ann Swinfen argues that a "profound sense of man's identity with the rest of the animal kingdom helps to account for the continued fascination with beast tales" like Aesop's fables (12). Animal story authors are simply trying to "re-establish that mutual understanding and rapport"; and we read these stories because we acknowledge that rapport and second their efforts. A. Paul Reed agrees that "the canine viewpoint [of Call of the Wild fosters] an immediate, unbreakable link with the natural world," "bringing man and nature</page><page sequence="3">64 Victorian Review closer together" (96, 98). By contrast, Elliot Gose believes that we read animal stories precisely because we do not identify with animals: reading about animals allows a degree of psychological distance or detachment. Authors write animal stories because they "can project through [the animals] psychological concerns that [their] readers either cannot or do not wish to experience directly in human terms" (5). Since as readers we are not likely to be fooled more than once by the same trick, we continue to read animal stories for their "double appeal, to the reader's desire both to escape and to face reality" (5).1 The animal stories of Potter, London, and Seton, by contrast, are neither mechanisms of denial nor therapies for assimilating the repressed. Rather than the sign of some psychological fixation on species (as the basis for similarity or difference), these three authors' foregrounding of animals as subjects allows them to specify how selves differ from each other. Potter's, London's, and Seton's texts are about how we differentiate ourselves, not about how we are human (as opposed to so-called brute animals).2 Animal characters like Seton's Wully or London's Buck ? both domestic dogs that go wild ? could be said to problematize not so much the boundary between man and beast as the boundary between selves. Potter's Peter Rabbit crosses boundaries of another kind: the property line of a farmer's garden. These three animal characters do not just cross such lines, however: Buck and Wully cross and re-cross territorial boundaries between the so-called domestic and the civilized; in trying to escape the garden he has invaded, Peter in fact gets stuck (literally wedged) at such a checkpoint. The repetitiveness of this crossing motion not only suggests that the wild/tame paradigm is far from stable but also insinuates that what is at issue is not these particular categories but the tenuous fact of differentiation itself. Over and above distinctions between "wild" and "tame," what each of these texts seems most concerned with is its protagonist's struggle to differentiate himself. This struggle is the process of psychic differentiation: how does the self become aware of itself? How does it conceive of itself as differentiated and therefore different from all that is not the self? Self differentiation is the process of becoming aware of oneself as a being that is both coherent within itself and distinct from other objects and beings. Sensing and thinking about oneself in this way is what in fact produces "self." Though the connection does not seem to have been made in animal story criticism, William James's Principles of Psychology (1890) is a contemporaneous text just as concerned with the intricate mechanisms and obstacles of self-differentiation.3 The way Potter's, London's, and Seton's animals go about the business of trying, failing, and succeeding in figuring out who they are bears an uncanny</page><page sequence="4">W.C. HARRIS 65 resemblance to the mechanics of functional and dysfunctional psychic differentiation as outlined in the Principles. Whether Potter, London, or Seton read James seems little to the point; what is undeniable is that all four authors are covering the same ground in much the same terms. The fact that each animal story excises one particular modality of psychic differentiation from James's model, and then worries about the possibilities and difficulties of that one modality becoming the sole praxis of self-distinction, suggests that if these animal story authors are not working directly from (a knowledge of) James, they are at the very least mired in a common cultural concern, working from and perhaps against a common gestalt. The question posed and variously answered by these texts is not "how do I distinguish myself from other species?" but rather Seton, London, and Potter disagree as to exactly how the latter should be done. In The Tale of Peter Rabbit the continual rediscovery of somatic boundaries differentiates the self. When Peter Rabbit trespasses on Mr. McGregor's land, he is conducting a survey of the self. The facility with which Peter "squeeze [s] under the gate" when entering the garden stands in emphatic contrast to his inability to squeeze under a door in the garden wall when, having been caught by McGregor, he is trying to escape (12). In the latter instance, Peter runs straight up against difference: the lesson learned is that "I am me because I stop where this door begins." Self-differentiation through the establishment of topographic relations to one's surroundings might be termed "psychotopography."4 The Call of the Wild and "Wully," however, disable this kind of self-mapping: London and Seton redirect our attention from the spatially bound self to the temporally bound self, the self that extends from yesterday to today, rather than from here to there. By focusing on boundaries inside the self, "Wully" and Call forsake spatial differentiation (I end where my body ends) in favor of temporal differentiation (I end where my memories end). Rather than making a map of the self, self-differentiation now involves making a history of the self ? knowing when it was instead of where it is. The term "psychohistoriography" describes both these specific criteria for the self (continuity and/or coherence over time) and also the self's active role in establishing that continuity.5 Although London's, Seton's, and Potter's accounts of self-differentiation all seem to work from something like the Jamesian model, two new terms, psychotopography and psychohistoriography, are necessary because Potter's account of self differentiation emphasizes slightly different elements of Jamesian psychology than do London's and Seton's. James asserts that "self is the result of a "reflective process," the end-product of the self's thinking about itself as a thinker.6 Sorting out the "resemblance among the parts of a continuum of feelings</page><page sequence="5">66 Victorian Review (especially bodily feelings) and experiences [,] along with things widely different [,]... thus constitutes the real and verifiable 'personal identity' which we feel" (I: 336). James may call it "personal identity," but this type of cultivated self-awareness seems to be available only through the active differentiation of oneself from all that is not the self. I am aware of myself because I have differentiated myself as a consistently coherent being, a being who, over time, is continuous with itself and discontinuous with other selves and objects. My continuity arises from the fact that my memories, thoughts, and feelings all have a common denominator: "me."7 Because the term "self has a range of connotations, in this paper the term "psyche" will be used (interchangeably with "self) to underscore the sense, first, that "self arises from the differentiation of memories and feelings that seem to belong to "me" from those that do not, and second, that this operation is a psychic (that is, subjective) phenomenon. James's notion of psychic life can be perceived, roughly, as occurring on two levels: an awareness of the body as different from surrounding objects; and the mind's awareness of itself (its memories and ideas) as continuous with one another as part of the same person. The first, outer awareness is truly differentiation: "out there" is sensed to be different from "in here." The second, inner awareness seems not so much differentiation as integration, or the establishment of continuity: "in here" is not being differentiated but rather identified with itself. And yet it is this continuity of the inner, of the self with itself, that could be said to differentiate the self: these memories are all "mine," and those are not; therefore, these memories constitute "me" while those do not. "Those" designates not simply something else but someone else. In the Principles, these two means of differentiation are part of the same model, working hand in hand to produce the life of the self. The physically-rooted means of differentiation is an immediate but also momentary phenomenon; for James, these moments are "assimilated, accreted, and knit on" ? concatenated one upon another, forming a chain of memories, thoughts, and moments that each "Thought" (James's name for one's "present mental state," or the self of the moment) appropriates, accepts as its property (II: 338, 341). This pile must then be sorted out, felt to be one's own: this is the task of historiography. For James it happens, at first, rather automatically: "as soon as [each Thought] comes into existence it finds [past thoughts] already its own" (II: 338). And yet, as in London and Seton, the pile must be sorted through: one's "present mental state" is a "vehicle of choice as well as of cognition; and among the choices it makes are these appropriations, or repudiations, of its 'own'" (II: 340). Potter extricates the momentary physically-derived means of differentiation as the means to which the self is limited, as if it is the only praxis it has to draw upon.</page><page sequence="6">W.C. HARRIS 67 The body is the core of the Jamesian psyche, or rather the site from which arises one's first impression of self: "with the bodily part... we feel the whole cubic mass of our body all the while [and] it gives us an unceasing sense of personal existence" (I: 333). For James, feeling "our entire cubic content," or our "crude extensivity," yields the "original sensation of space" which includes our bodies in space (II: 135). From the first and crudest (that is, the infant's) distinction between "in here" and "out there," self-awareness and self-differentiation are bodily experiences: Certainly a child newly born in Boston, who gets a sensation from the candle-flame ... or from his diaper-pin, does not . . . know anything about their space-relations to anything else in the world. The flame fills its own place, the pain fills its own place; but as yet these places are neither identified with, nor discriminated from, any other places. That comes later. ... By his body ... the child later means simply that place where the pain from the pin, and a lot of other sensations like it, were or are felt. . . . [T]hat pain is part of what he means by the word body. Just so by the outer world the child means nothing more than that place where the candle-flame and a lot of other sensations like it are felt. ... [T]he candle is part of what he means by 'outer world.'" (II: 34-35) The cartographic is an extremely apt figure, since in both Peter Rabbit and the Principles the psyche is very much a constructed affair that is first "felt" or felt out, in the body. In James, the body is not given, nor made by parents or mitosis, but made by the self after the fact of differentiation. The body results from an "act of . . . construction," not from a flash of "intuition" (II: 147). And self-construction seems no less the stuff of slapstick for Potter than it does for James. Spatial orientation (of what is in space, which includes the body) requires the kind of friction Peter experiences when he rubs against the garden door, savoring not simply the pathos of his entrapment but the strange new awareness of being entrapped at all, of being at all different: "Only when a second point is felt... can the first one acquire a determination of up, down, right or left. ... Each point, so far as it is placed, is then only by virtue of what it is not" (II: 154). But we are not just sensing the door, or the space where the door is; we are perceiving the body as that which strikes the door but is not coincident with it: "To begin with, every sensation of the skin and every visual sensation seems to drive from its topographic seat a peculiar shade of feeling, which it would not have in another place. And this feeling per se seems quite another thing from the perception of the place" (II: 155; emphasis added).8</page><page sequence="7">68 Victorian Review However long it takes, though, psychic differentiation takes the body, takes its tangibility as the point d'appui for the "material Self: Why do we thus so markedly select the tangible to be the real? ... The tangible qualities are the least fluctuating. . . . [T]he tactile properties are those most intimately connected with our weal or woe. A dagger hurts us only when in contact with our skin, a poison only when we take it into our mouths. ... It is as tangibles, then, that things concern us most_( : 306) Psychotopography differentiates my outside from my inside, but my inside is still a jumble of undifferentiated, unordered experiences of doors. This disorder is greatly due to the lack of temporal differentiation. The problem is not so much telling myself apart from doors as telling who I am today apart from who I was yesterday ? and connecting the two. If time collapses, I cannot know myself as continuous over time. If I cannot distinguish today's experiences from yesterday's, then there is no chronology, and therefore I have no story. Self-historiography is impossible because only a self-history can inform me that certain things happened to me in a certain order. If all my door-experiences seem to have happened today, then there is no story other than one sentence (I opened doors all day); there is none of the progression that makes a story go forward ? indeed, none of the progression that makes a story. If I know that yesterday I went swimming and that the day before that I paid my taxes, then those two experiences posit a self that did both those things and that therefore exists over time. Ordering those two events is the first step in self-historiography ? the ongoing correlation of temporal distinct selves into one psychically continuous self. Psychohistoriography does not ask, as Potter does, "how do I distinguish myself from other selves?" but "how do I characterize my self over time?" That is, "How do I tell me from you yesterday? How do I know if I am the same person I was yesterday, or last year? How do I establish my continuity, my history?" Psychohistoriography, as offered by London and Seton, tells me that I am continuously discontinuous: I am distinct from that door not only today but yesterday. This means that my experiences of that door are consistent with one another (they are all experiences of the same door). But all these door experiences are consistent in another way: they are all experiences of my opening or closing that door; they are experiences of rye. Since they all have in common the same psychic origin and reserVoir (? opened that door, and I remember doing it), together these experiences constitute "me." In James, certainly, self-awareness is not available a priori but is rather the result of labor:</page><page sequence="8">W.C. HARRIS 69 The sense of personal identity is not . . . [a] mere synthetic form essential to all thought. It is the sense of a sameness perceived by thought and predicated of things thought-about. These things are a present self and a self of yesterday. The self not only thinks them both, but thinks that they are identical... [in other words, that] / am the same self that I was yesterday. (I: 332) Thus my experiences both remembered and present constitute a "me" that exists over time. Telling yesterday apart from today enables me to tell my story, to order the events in my mental and physical life: "this happened yesterday, that happened today," and so on. Together these temporally organized experiences constitute that "me" in the form of a history, a self-narrative. Although these two means of differentiation together constitute one model in James (each psychotopographic event gets enchained onto such past events), these means are articulated separately by London, Seton, and Potter. For James, the body may be the core and origin of psychic identity; for Potter, it is the only site. The body in the moments is the self's only resource. The work of the self, for London and Seton, is psychohistoriography ? that is, sorting through the inherited "property" that comprises the self (moments of differentiation). The ease with which these three animal stories can be correlated with this or that part of the Principles should not, however, be overestimated. For the ease of differentiation is precisely what each text in turn (James included) asserts, worries about, and refutes. The generic notion of differentiation receives sophistication from the way the psychotopographic and psychohistoriographic elements of the Jamesian model are rearticulated, in animal stories contemporaneous with the Principles, into two distinct, apparently independent models.9 As texts fairly contemporaneous with James's Principles, Potter's, London's, and Seton's stories show the matter to be far from settled, the means, possibility, and finality of differentiation far from agreed upon in 1890 and still not settled little over a decade later on both sides of the Atlantic.10 Call of the Wild, "Wully," and Peter Rabbit also constitute a critical site in the history of the animal story ? the genre's turn-of century renaissance in England and America.11 Although these three early twentieth-century texts fall outside the period (the late eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century) labeled by historians of children's literature as that genre's golden age, Ernest Thompson Seton saw himself and other authors included in Famous Animals Stories as still living in that resurgence: "It so happens that in the last fifty years [1882-1932] there has been a greater output of [animal stories] than in all the previous centuries, so far as the records show" (v). The contents</page><page sequence="9">70 Victorian Review of Seton's anthology bear him out, jumping from Aesop to the Grimm brothers. The temporal gap in the record that Seton posits (from the sixth century B.C. to 1812) nearly matches the gap noted by historians and anthologists alike.12 London, Seton, and Potter are not just contemporaries;13 they are contemporaries involved in the same discussion: using animal stories to dissect the process of self differentiation. While the most obvious differentiation in any animal story would appear to be that between animals and humans, the level at which differentiation is most salient for the animal protagonists of these stories is that not of species but of selves. These authors suggest that crude and facile distinctions, as embodied in binary oppositions like man/beast and self/not-self, are the blunt instruments we must use to sharpen the edge of differentiation and make our way toward a subtler, less static notion of psychic life. That is not to say that antitheses ceased to be of use in the early twentieth century; they remained the terms one must use, the irreducibles with which one must begin and, most importantly, the terms by which one must continue to gauge one's progress toward more nuanced, heterogeneous territory. The most striking feature of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit is that Peter wears clothes. Most of her animals do, as Potter's illustrations make clear: Peter's mother wears a housecoat and an apron when she cooks; when she goes shopping her ensemble includes a more formal dress, cloak, bonnet, and umbrella. Peter wears a blue coat with shiny brass buttons. He sports rabbit-sized clogs on his hind feet; in fact, he walks on his hind legs as a biped would. But do these sartorial and ambulatory habits constitute anthropomorphism? Are Peter and company to be read as allegory, as humans described as animals, or as animals endowed with human cognition? This question is a common one about animal stories as a whole. What seems significant about the episode in which Peter loses his clothes is that Peter is neither simply a child who has ruined his Sunday best, nor simply an animal that had no business wearing clothes now returned to his "natural" state. "Natural" doesn't stick, anyway: the majority of Potter's animal characters consistently wear clothing. For these animals, wearing clothes is natural. As I hope the following makes clear, dwelling on Peter's clothes (specifically as markers of constriction or repression) is as wrongheaded as dwelling on the anthropomorphic question. A sartorial critical focus diverts our attention away from the fact that Peter wears clothes and then loses them to the less interesting fact that he wears them in the first place. Peter loses his clothes because he is</page><page sequence="10">W.C HARRIS 71 running away from Mr. McGregor, on whose land he has trespassed and whose vegetables he has just eaten. In escaping the garden (and no doubt the fate of becoming dinner), Peter is only able to leave the garden with his body. What Peter becomes aware of is not that he is naked but rather that his body is the irreducible core of himself, that which, unlike clothes, he cannot get rid of. A comparison of Peter's travails with the Jamesian account of psychic differentiation by way of the body suggests that clothes may be one model of differentiation, but they are not the first, not the original, not the most pungent and visceral source of psychic individuation. Psychotopography, or the discovery of one's own somatic limits, is underscored as what first produces the awareness of a distinct self. The fact that Peter must lose his clothes to learn this bodily lesson implies that he failed to get it right the first time. The red herring of Peter's clothes has been successful in diverting attention from the removal of clothes, and so getting down to the body has been overlooked. Part of this may be attributable to the theoretical interest of clothes in Victorian and gender studies. Carole Scott's and W. Nikola-Lisa's work in this area is representative of these critics' tendency to sacrifice the force of their acute observations by relying on the rather ready-to-hand notions of the liberal subject and the Victorian repressive hypothesis. It is not clear what bearing the connection between hysteria and tight corsets has on Peter Rabbit ("Clothes in Nature" 79). Clothes, are, according to Scott, inexplicably both "repressive" and "expressive" of identity ("the way we see ourselves"), which itself fails to get articulated in a historically specific manner ("Between Me" 192). Nikola-Lisa applies the terms of class and gender analysis with similarly broad strokes: "like many women of the late Victorian age, Potter felt the constant tension between individuality and convention, between independence and submission" (63). A biographical turn serves only to add Potter's name to the list of successful women who "could hold [their] own against any man" but whose lives were nonetheless "marred by [their] shadowed existence under the pervasive domination of her father and her father's friends" (63). If critics have not been distracted by Potter the woman, they have been distracted by women in general. Scott is correct in saying that for Potter "interaction defines the self," but I believe that such interaction concerns the making of distinguishing marks (psychotopography) rather than the wearing of them (clothes). If clothing represents "the value as well as the constraint in the relationship between self and society," the body is the first means of psychic differentiation. The contention that Peter knows that losing his clothes is "reprehensible" seems to rest on an assumption of the Victorian body as "tinged with guilt" (79). The Principles' emphasis on the primacy of somatic differentiation, by</page><page sequence="11">72 Victorian Review contrast, brings us back to a less value-laden (and more historically specific) context. Just as psychotopography lies closer to the body than clothing, James brings us closer to the crux of Peter Rabbit, to Peter himself, to his body. For James, clothes are part of the "material Self." They are integument, at the center of which lies the body, that "innermost part of the material Self in each of us ... [?] certain parts more intimately ours than the rest. The clothes come next" (I: 292). That Peter sheds his clothes before he runs into the garden door suggests the movement from a more contrived means of differentiation (clothes) to a means of differentiation that is natural inasmuch as it is bodily. The core, the primitive level to which differentiation is being held (Peter is stripped down) is the so viscerally described "fat little body." This moment is originary because it marks the creation of the self, its bringing itself into being; perhaps this is the last moment the self will be free and clear to do so. Soon, he will be dressed. His clothes will be gendered: he gets a blue coat; his sisters, red capes. Gender and class are not yet at issue for the infant, for whom such social prescriptions postdate the somatic self-prescription described by James, which is merely a sharpening of the infant's crudest, originary differentiation (the sense of me/not-me): "The first sensation which an infant gets is for him the Universe" (II: 8).14 In the light of James's and Potter's focus on stripping down, on getting back to basics, it does not seem that Peter sheds his clothes in an act of rebellion against the prescriptive intent with which they may have been endowed by those (embodied in Mrs. Rabbit) who dress him, who instruct him in the care or maintenance of dress. (Remember, he has already ruined one outfit.) Getting rid of his clothes is certainly necessary for his escape from McGregor's clutches. But the strongest evidence against interpreting disrobing as a critique of sartorial (or in general, social) prescription is the fact that Peter returns to wearing clothes and thus to what Scott and Nikola-Lisa might call the state of "repression." The story of Peter Rabbit does not seem worth telling if it is merely a tale of the self buckling under, not to external forces, but rather by its own volition. Taking the repressive hypothesis the next step, and saying that the return to dress signals Peter's internalization of repression, simply does not feel right. Peter Rabbit details a much less pernicious kind of self-monitoring ? namely, merely knowing the lay of the psychic land, the coordinates of the self. Peter returns to a state of dress because he has learned those coordinates. Now he has a point or two to steer by. Now there will be a self to be aware that this coat that his mother makes him wear is not "me" but also that it is, as James would say, not "not-me" Whether I like or detest the coat, it is, in some sense, a part of me. It informs me; it tells me who I am, in the sense that it supplies a shred of the sparse but hungered-for who-I-am-to-others. In</page><page sequence="12">W.C. HARRIS 73 James's terms, for better or worse, the coat forms part of my material Self (at least the days I wear it); it bears some relation to "me." Knowing what the core of "me" is ? before coats and clogs and gender and class all get layered on ? does more than orient the self. It prevents "me" from being swallowed up in, consumed by, displaced by those things, my things; it prevents me from being confused with, if not replaced by, that which is mine.15 If clothes are an attempt to differentiate Peter, he must initially lack differentiation, as the opening illustration suggests. Mrs. Rabbit's large size and her position in the foreground differentiate her from her children. But nothing distinguishes her children from one another. They are a mass of undifferentiated bunnies: they are all in the background; they are all the same color and size. Since we cannot tell them apart, the illustration's one distinguishing feature ? the one rabbit who is going into (not out of) the tree ? is no help.

Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter" (11). But what good are names, if the rabbits look exactly alike? Figure 2. Mrs. Rabbit to her children: "'You may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden,'" from The Tale of Peter Rabbit Peter is just another undifferentiated bunny: we cannot pick out our protagonist. The very next illustration differentiates Peter by clothing: he, and he alone, wears a blue jacket. It is true that his siblings wear red capes, but their capes are identical and thus fail to differentiate them from each other. Since they never wear clothes except in this illustration, and since these clothes are identical, they remain undifferentiated bunnies throughout the story. Without clothes, other distinguishing marks (like names) are useless and fall away as well. With or without clothes, they are instructively impossible to tell apart. Peter's siblings in a sense cannot wear clothes because they are still bunnies: they are not simply still babies and thus immature or non-adult; it is true they have not passed the line between childhood and adulthood, but there is another line they have not yet crossed ? the line that separates non-identity from identity, and nondifferentiation from differentiation. They are the undifferentiated bunnies from whom I take my title. The supreme sign of Peter's initial lack of differentiation is his trespassing in McGregor's garden. By "trespass" I mean transgression of not just any law but the law that guarantees individuals privacy. In Peter Rabbit privacy and, indeed, individuality are hypostatized (as they often are legally) in fences, in the "well-marked" lines that distinguish one person's property from another's. To trespass on</page><page sequence="14">W.C. HARRIS 75 another's land is not simply to disrespect notions of private property. To disregard a "No Trespassing" sign or a gate ? the line that separates "mine" from "yours" ? is to not recognize the difference between "me" and "you." Trespass, in Peter Rabbit at least, is a solipsistic act, a deed of the undifferentiated self. Trespass then is not a crime but rather a necessary step in the differentiation of the self. Peter trespasses because he is narcissistic; he does not differentiate between inner and outer, "mine" and "yours." Peter's journey in the story is a journey toward differentiation ? toward marking well the difference not only between what belongs to him and to others, but between what he is and what others are. Identity could be expressed as where one does and does not belong: "I am this" because "I belong here and not there." Here again, my approach differs significantly from generically-driven accounts of Potter's work and animal stories in general. Humphrey Carpenter, for instance, reads Peter Rabbit as an "ironic comment" on the fairy tales it undeniably resembles: like "Jack" of beanstalk fame, Peter ignores his mother's advice and ends up running from a giant (McGregor) (Secret Gardens 145). Reading Potter through Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm in this way produces a Potter unable to depart from tradition: "That [Potter] should choose such a theme [as Jack and the Beanstalk] is not very surprising ? it predominates in the Grimms' fairy tales and many other classic folktale collections, and it was perhaps a natural subject for someone so congenitally shy, who viewed the prospect of any encounter with a stranger with considerable anxiety" ("Subversive Element" 286). If we ask the more useful question ? "how does Peter Rabbit differ from "Jack and the Beanstalk"? ? the answer sees to lie in psychotopography. "Jack and. the Beanstalk" is certainly about trespass and boundaries. But Jack leaves as he came in: through clouds, without boundaries. When Peter runs into the garden door, Potter's text makes a quantum leap beyond repeating the fairy tale adage that happiness is in your own backyard by nailing down the reason for that happiness. You have to leave your own backyard (and trespass on someone else's) not simply to appreciate the happiness of your own backyard, but to know that you have a backyard ? indeed, a "you" ? in the first place. Reading Peter Rabbit against James's Principles provides a more substantive way to talk about what kind of work her story is doing: the very practical ? in this case, the somatic ? work of differentiation is integral not just to writing a story but to comprehending one's own story. Transgression is here not so much an index of sin as a sign of the lack of differentiation, or of the failure to acknowledge "you" and "yours" as (significantly) different from "me" and "mine." Peter's mother warns him not to "go into Mr. McGregor's garden" and not to</page><page sequence="15">76 Victorian Review "get into mischief (11). But as soon as Mrs. Rabbit goes to market, "Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!" (12). If nothing else does, the exclamation point tells us ? indeed, marks well the fact ? that Peter has done something wrong as well as dangerous. Sneaking into the garden is certainly dangerous: McGregor might catch Peter and "put him in a pie," as he did to Peter's father. Sneaking into the garden is also wrong, but wrong only insofar as it is represented as trespass: he "squeezefs] under the gate," and the gate is a marker of ownership, a mark that differentiates property as well as selves. Peter disobeys his mother to the letter: he literally "get[s] into mischief (emphasis added). When Peter gets caught for trespassing, he has already stolen ("First he ate some lettuces and some French beans" [13]). In the Jamesian context, Peter trespasses and steals, not because he wants to defy authority but because he fails to recognize the limits of his own psyche. If there is no one but Peter, then the vegetables could not belong to anyone else. It is easy to object that, of course, Peter knows the vegetables are not his: the place his mother forbids him to go has a name, McGregor's garden; the garden is named after another and thereby marked as another's. But the blitheness of Peter's trespass and theft, juxtaposed with his defining moment of running into the locked door in a nearly aborted escape attempt, suggests that the problem is that Peter has forgotten (or rather never learned) precisely this lesson, the lesson of differentiation. Perhaps the point is that differentiation is not a lesson to be learned second-hand: it must be, as James would italicize it, "felt"; and it must be viscerally felt, literally hit upon: To have a self that I can care for [one 'for which I feel such hot regard'], nature must first present me with some object interesting enough to make me instinctively wish to appropriate it for its own sake, and out of it to manufacture one of those material, social, or spiritual selves. . . . These objects our consciousness treats as the primordial constituents of its Me. Whatever other objects, whether by association with the fate of these, or in any other way, come to be followed with the same sort of interest, form our remoter and more secondary self. (1:319) We must recall that by "Self James does not mean "the mere pronoun I," but instead "consciousness" of Self, in relation to other selves or objects ? in other words, consciousness differentiated, consciousness of being one thing and not any number of others. Peter eats the vegetables because they are "interesting enough to . . . wish to appropriate," because they seem to be his. The problem is not that food or other material goods are not validly part of the "material Self." Far</page><page sequence="16">W.C. HARRIS 77 from it: the problem is that Peter has gotten someone else's "material," not to say his "remoter and more secondary," self mixed up with his own. Shedding his clothes is a way of getting back to basics, of returning to the drawing-board on which psychic self-awareness is first drafted, that is, first differentiated. The sheer act of losing his clothes, however, is not what differentiates Peter. His sisters remove their clothes to pick blackberries; but they return home with their clothes. While unclothed, they do nothing to differentiate themselves: they all pick berries. Peter, by contrast, leaves his clothes behind; we might say he is lucky to escape from McGregor with his life. He could be said to leave the clothes behind because he cannot be hindered: not only can he run faster without his clothes, he also cannot very well run (especially on all fours) and carry them at the same time.16 He escapes with only what he can carry: his body. While unclothed, Peter viscerally discovers his difference (pressing against the locked door), and that is what he must carry away with him. At the moment Peter loses his clothes, he approaches differentiation. He bares the means by which he will eventually be differentiated. Peter's sudden nakedness points us to his body as both the site and the means of psychic differentiation. Clothes are left behind because they only get in the way. Like clothes, the body is a kind of portable property; but the body is a kind of portable property which you cannot help but carry with you. When Peter loses his clothes and presses his "fat little body" against the garden door, the text seems to be saying, "You cannot get around the body." Just as Peter presses against the door, Peter Rabbit is pressing upon us the somatically rooted quality, the bodiliness, of psychic identity. And without clothes the body is less restricted: Peter is now free to run into doors, to discover his topographic and thus psychic relation to the world. Without clothes the body is more able to get around and begin mapping its boundaries. It is an obvious fact that clothes do differentiate, and to deny this obvious state of affairs would be counterintuitive. But what is also intuitive and perhaps not obvious is that we are dealing with two modalities of differentiation. It is much to the point that bodies can be distinguished without clothes. I can tell two naked bodies apart. That is, I can tell they are distinct bodies, that they count as two. Clothes would enable me, certainly, to tell whose bodies they are, in the general and perhaps in the specific sense (the one wearing a wimple is a nun; the one wearing my brother's monogrammed shirt is my brother). But of course, clothes lie; they can serve as lies and disguises. These bodies may have been impersonating a nun and my brother, respectively. But this kind of identity is not what I am talking about and not what seems at issue in either Potter's or James's text. From the point of view of</page><page sequence="17">78 Victorian Review Peter Rabbit or the Principles, identity is not anything so specific as who I am (that I'm Peter Rabbit or William James). Perhaps identity is the wrong word altogether. Differentiation, at this ground level, is the demarcation of the "Self." As James makes clear, there are several parts to the Self, all of which are in greater or less flux. My own reading, contrasted with those of Scott and Nikola-Lisa, conveys the fact that differentiation is not so blunt a term as one might alternately hope and fear. It makes nothing like a clean cut ? certainly not a final one. For psychotopography is hardly the end of the line; the self cannot continue long along the me/not-me axis. That axis will shift, snap, be crossed by new axes, neither quite parallel nor quite perpendicular. What a Jamesian reading of Peter Rabbit does is illuminate the latter text's arresting of psychic life. The fences around McGregor's garden seem designed less to keep Peter out than to narrow the field of differentiation, of psychic terms, to one, and to hoe and hone that field and that term. The desire may be simply to get this "core self' down pat. But Potter's bucolic retreat (in life and in fiction), within the context of a nation's finding it ever harder to be all it has claimed for itself (a far-flung Empire), makes Peter Rabbit resonate with a more poignant motive: to postpone the seemingly inevitable moment at which the self is hailed by more voices, more institutions, and called upon in more and more contexts to be less and less, to move one irrevocable step farther away from the "fit" that the self once (or at least thinks, hopes it) knew. What differentiates Peter is not the boundaries he crosses without noticing (the gate he squeezes under to get into the garden) but rather the boundaries that resist him bodily. Like a man walking in a darkened room, he locates himself by butting up against boundaries and viscerally discovering that that over there is different from and thus outside of "me." This is the force of the term psychotopography: Peter gains a sense of his distinct self by mapping it with his body, just as he maps McGregor's property line (the gate) with his body. What could sting more than running into a closed door, as Peter does? Potter here underscores James's focus on the body as that object which has the most "immediate sting of interest." According to James, if the "fons et origo of all reality . . . is . . . ourselves," then psychic reality consists of "all objects which have an immediate sting of interest. ... A whole system may be real, if it only hang to our Ego by one immediately stinging term" (II: 297). The body is the "most immediately stinging term" because it is where we are stung ? meaning not merely where we sense pain, but where we actually feel that which is closest to ourselves. Of all our sensory organs, the skin is literally the meeting place of "me" and "not-me": the skin is the closest that any object that is not the self (the so-called objective world) can come to the self; but it</page><page sequence="18">W.C. HARRIS 79 is also the closest the self will ever come to that outside world, to what the self is not. Skin is the point, perhaps the only point, at which subjective and objective life could be most convincingly said to be one. I think that coincidence is ? is, in fact, what produces ? the "sting" James talks about. Subjective life originates, in part, from bodily experiences; it is written on the body, impressed upon the body. But what is written there is the body's and therefore the psyche's difference from what is (whatever object is) doing the writing. It makes sense to say that the psyche is stung into existence, because one feels the sting only once the stimulus is removed or at least distinguished as external. The sting is the mark of differentiation, the pushing apart ever so slightly of "me" and "not-me." The self is not as large as it had supposed. It has borders, limits. Discovering those limits may carry a pang, a pathos; but James and Potter remind us that it also carries a corporeal sting. For Peter, to discover the boundaries between what is the garden and what is not the garden is to comprehend a topography of both what is his own psyche and what is not. Running up against the door but not being able to run through it ? getting stuck there ? gives Peter the sense that his body ends there. Dwelling on obstruction means dwelling on difference: it means differentiating. For both James and Potter, "'the adjustment of inner to outer relations'" is the "essence of mental life of bodily life" (I: 6). When Peter Rabbit butts up against the garden door, he is accomplishing with his body what James calls the fundamental, originary act of differentiation: the "splitting of the whole universe into two halves ... 'me' and 'not-me' (I: 289).17 The sense of where the body ends reasserts the idea that the Jamesian Self ends at a specific point or points ( , Y and Z). In regard to Peter's theft, getting stuck at the door reinforces the Jamesian notion that the "Self of selves" does not own (that the self does not include) those things (the vegetables) which it mistakenly thought it included (I: 301). Theft in this case is not the demonstration of a disregard for property laws or for the feelings of other people. Theft is, rather, a demonstration of not having down the notion of what regarding is, of the criteria which allow one to acknowledge and regard others because one has first acknowledged and regarded the self. Theft is the act of a falsely perceived self. Peter is just now learning what belongs to him in every sense of the word.18 The importance of the body rather than clothes is instantiated in the moment Peter first loses his clothes: he runs faster without shoes and so is able to run up against obstacles to himself more quickly. Obstacles are things differentiated from something like himself as well as things that differentiate him as a self when he collides with them. In his flight Peter finds a door in the garden wall, but "it was locked, and there was no</page><page sequence="19">80 Victorian Review room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath" (17). He notices the door only because he cannot get through it. The door ? unlike the gate and apparently the jacket ? differentiates Peter from the outside world. It says, "you end here; you end where I begin." And it is through being opposed that Peter gains a sense of identity. I have called identity a kind of portable property not because that is the best way to think of it, but because Peter experiences his new identity as just that. He experiences his identity at the same time he experiences his body ? "a fat little rabbit." "Fat" is not a moralizing jab: a newly shaped body is as unwieldy as a new identity. The problem of getting around has thus yielded to the problem of getting himself around: he has now to negotiate space (open versus closed) because he now has a body. He differs from the things around him. He differs from his siblings, certainly, whose berrying in the woods links up with the gooseberry net that traps Peter. Connections like that drive home the fact that in Peter Rabbit differentiation results not from passively accepting the marks and boundaries given to you by other people (like capes and coats) but rather from actively discovering and establishing marks and boundaries. Undifferentiated, Peter trespasses. When he fattens himself and cannot get out as easily as he got in, he has differentiated himself. Eating McGregor's vegetables does not matter so much as a crime (stealing), much less as a critique of property rights. What matters is that the vegetables are not his, but only insofar as they are not him. It is true that once he eats them, they become him: the vegetables are what makes Peter fat. But they also make him too fat to squeeze under the door ? the door that reinstates the very difference that his appetite ignored: I am Peter Rabbit because I am not McGregor; likewise, the woods are my home because this garden is not; it is McGregor's home. In the psychotopographic model, one gains self-awareness by sensing the limits of one's body, but this is not a one-time affair. Apparently, one has to reset these boundaries over and over again. We learn at the story's end that this is not the first time Peter has lost his clothes: "It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that he had lost in a fortnight!" (20). Given the connection in this text between losing clothes and trespass, we may also conclude that this is not the first time Peter has differentiated himself. If he did so once, why is it necessary to do it again? Why do I as a reader have the suspicion that it will not be the last time? The repetitive nature of differentiation through trespass is evidence from return visits to McGregor's garden by Peter and others in The Tale of Benjamin Bunny (1904) and The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies (1909). Given the fact that Peter's father ended up "in a pie," he apparently never stopped going either. Why do the rabbits keep going back if they are always getting stuck (behind doors, under</page><page sequence="20">W.C. HARRIS 81 baskets, or in burlap sacks)? The obvious answer is that the rabbits keep going back because they are hungry. But if Peter is simply hungry, why doesn't he join his siblings in the woods where he could eat berries for free instead of stealing them from McGregor? Why doesn't he wait for his mother to return from her grocery shopping? Why doesn't he go with her, in that case? The fact that he selects neither of these options suggests that food is not what he is after. He is hungry, but not simply for food. He is hungry for self-differentiation: it is perhaps obvious that Peter wants to do things his own way; but to do so is precisely to distinguish himself, to differentiate the rabbit that is Peter (from the world as well as from other rabbits). Potter's rabbits return to the garden because getting stuck ? running up against opposition ? differentiates them. The active discovery of somatic boundaries constitutes their identity. But this identity seems unstable, as if it fades once they escape, and so must be re-established by trespass. What, then, of the fact that in Benjamin Bunny "the first thing is to get back Peter's clothes" (60)? Is Potter vacillating on the appropriateness of clothes as markers of identity? No ? because Benjamin and Peter are re-enacting the first book's model of differentiation: they enter the garden and eat McGregor's vegetables; they get trapped (in a basket instead of behind a door); and they are driven out of the garden (this time by Benjamin's father).19 The critical preoccupation with clothes distracts us from the psychotopographic nature of identity in Potter and from the Peter Rabbit stories' pronounced transition from clothes to the body. By the time Peter finds his clothes in Benjamin Bunny they have shrunk in the rain and no longer fit. Clothes that do not fit draw attention to Peter's body just as the garden door does, and thus they emphasize that both Peter and his clothes have changed since the first visit to the garden. Ruth MacDonald contends that "Peter's life . . . [is] not altered by the adventure" (33). I would agree, with one qualification: Peter is altered but only temporarily. The differentiation he achieves in the garden fades once he is back with the bunnies and out of contact with the kind of visceral difference generated by his body's straining against the garden door. Peter is differentiated, but the maintenance of difference is an "ongoing" enterprise (33). If clothes were what differentiated Peter, he would not need to return to the McGregor's garden. He could simply get a new coat. As we learn at the end of Peter Rabbit, the coat he has just lost was a new coat, a replacement. Another coat, then, will not do the trick. The implication is that getting stuffed with lettuces and getting stuck against the garden door again will do the trick (temporarily). If clothes are superseded by trespass as the means of differentiation in Benjamin Bunny, clothes fade from concern altogether in The Tale of</page><page sequence="21">82 Victorian Review the Flopsy Bunnies. As if to press the point that differentiation is not about clothes but about trespass (that is, psychotopography), the trespassers in this story are an emphatically undifferentiated mass of bunnies: "I do not remember [their] separate names . . .; they were generally called the 'Flopsy bunnies'" (199; emphasis added). The narrator has given up on the specificity of names this time; she is reduced to speaking "generally." At this moment, differentiation among bunnies, or differentiation of any one of the bunnies (the focus of Peter Rabbit) is irrelevant. The psyche being differentiated at this moment is not Peter's but the narrator's. It matters only that the bunnies are different from "me"; telling them apart would be overkill. So not only do Peter, Benjamin, and the other rabbits re-enact what seems to be a tenuous differentiation, but Potter and her narrator persistently return (in four Peter Rabbit stories spanning from 1902 to 1912) to the need for and enactment of differentiation. Potter's Rabbit tales are obviously about the same characters or species. But the tales, like the rabbits, return to the same place ? McGregor's garden, that site of the discovery of differentiation through trespass ? as if to a primal scene, to the origin of a very live crisis. | Ml *1 Figure 3. The Flopsy Bunnies after a meal in McGregor's garden: "It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is 'soporific,'" from The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies. In Potter's rabbit tales psychotopography is an ongoing enterprise of differentiation. If returning to McGregor's garden allows the rabbits to discover who they are by coming up against what they are not, returning to the garden also informs ? if not their author's sense of identity ? her sense that identity is sustained by psychotopography. The opening lines of The Flopsy Bunnies suggest that narrators require differentiation as much as bunnies do: "It is said that the eating of too much lettuce is 'soporific' / have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then / am not a rabbit" (199). The narrator is able to express what</page><page sequence="22">W.C. HARRIS 83 she is only in relation to what she is not. In terms of psychotopography or psychic differentiation, it does not matter so much that she is, as she says, "not a rabbit." It is, by contrast, crucial that the narrator is not what Figure 3 depicts: she is not a mass of undifferentiated bunnies but instead one non-bunny; she is one as opposed to a mass, and one self as opposed to other selves. The force of Figure 3, however, is its originary character: the first image in The Flopsy Bunnies, it recalls the first illustration in Peter Rabbit, the book that initiated Potter's literary career. A mass of undifferentiated bunnies is the origin of narrative, an index of a praxis that has as much to do with telling a story as with being aware of one's own body. The force of "/ am not a rabbit" is that the narrator must not be a mass of undifferentiated bunnies; she must be singular, differentiated. Otherwise, there is no narrative "I" to tell the story, because there is only nondifferentiation. No one would exist to speak of the Flopsy Bunnies, but at the same time no one would exist to speak o/(that is, no narrator and thus no subject matter, no narrative). There would be no one to speak, for differentiation not only enables psychotopography but also allows one to read the map so made. Differentiation originates and maintains narrative speech. If, as Emile Benveniste has written, "it is in and through language that man constitutes himself as a subject," and if "consciousness of self is only possible if it is experienced by contrast," then saying "/ am not a rabbit" is necessary to the act of self-differentiation for Potter's narrator, and therefore necessary to there being a narrative at all (224). Narration is the opening up and maintaining of subjective and thus narrative space. Saying "I" is inextricable from the narrator's self differentiation. Saying "I" means saying "not a rabbit," means speaking of that which is not "me." As Benveniste puts it, "I use / only when I am speaking to someone who will be a you in my address. ... Language is possible only because each speaker sets himself up as a subject by referring to himself as I in his discourse. Because of this, / posits another person, the one who, being as he is, completely exterior to 'me,' becomes my echo to whom I say you and who says you to me" (224). The Flopsy Bunnies may not speak directly to the narrator, but it is their presence ? as over against "me," as what "/ am not," as undifferentiated ? that "says you" to the narrator, that maintains the (dialogic) space of narration. m Call of the Wild and "Wully" do not ignore the territorial boundaries so central to Peter Rabbit. For London's Buck and Seton's Wully, physical boundaries inform their sense of who they are: the walls</page><page sequence="23">84 Victorian Review and fences of the domestic spaces these pets inhabit distinguish them from wild animals. To be wild is to be outdoors, to be on a plain without walls or boundaries. But the resemblance of these texts to Peter Rabbit ends here. If Potter is concerned with reinforcing physical boundaries, London and Seton make a business of frustrating those boundaries, of depicting the circumstances under which psychotopography is no longer viable. The problematization of physical boundaries by London and Seton is not so much a disavowal of psychotopography as it is a critique of that model's limitations. The critique is that psychotopography, being a purely spatial account of the self, is incomplete because it ignores the self's temporal dimension. It only takes the self so far: the brute distinction of "in here" from "out there." The force of Wully's and Buck's stories is that landscapes like the Yukon and the American West supply few, if any, geographic markers and so disable the data upon which psychotopography relies. Differentiation must then be made on a different basis, a basis not external to mind, like space, but rather internal: time. Psychotopography tells me where I am but not when I am. This lack of temporal differentiation explains the repetitiveness of Potter's rabbit tales: Peter returns to the garden time after time precisely because each time seems like the first time. Peter is not simply willfully disobedient. Rather, his recidivism reveals the limited territory (the temporally and geographically immediate) to which Potter is limiting psychic differentiation, her excision of psychotopography from the Jamesian model (in which psychotopography and psychohistoriography work hand in hand). When Peter leaves the garden door behind ? when that door is no longer resistant to Peter's body ? then he also leaves behind psychic differentiation. For Potter, psychic life is experienced, and so written, to the moment. Psychotopography is thus not simply place-specific but time-specific as well: the day after the events of Peter Rabbit, Peter's differentiated self is as non-existent as the vegetables he ate the day before. Unlike most maps, the psychotopographic map is good only for the moment (and place) of its making. Such a map fails to outlast the present because it is a map of the self in relation to a certain place and therefore takes account only of the way things lie now, and nothing more. The passing of time may not affect the map of the garden but it is integral to an account of the self, which is a series of maps as opposed to one map. Without the ability to tell past from present, however, the crisis of self-differentiation reaches a new height. If last year is as present to me as today, how can I order my experiences? How can I tell memory apart from present experience? I am no longer undifferentiated simply from this desk and that chair. Worse, what if I am unable to differentiate between myself and a chair? In the snow-covered Yukon,</page><page sequence="24">W.C. HARRIS 85 there is only myself. How then do I characterize myself, that is, differentiate among the memories and experiences that I consider mine? To compare this case to Peter's, the boundaries of the undifferentiated self span not simply McGregor's garden but all the gardens that have ever existed. London and Seton intervene at this point to suggest that temporal differentiation is necessary to stabilize any account of the self, to separate the "maps" into a series, a sequence that tells a story. These texts depict the self actively working out its own chronology; they depict psychohistoriography. What Call of the Wild and "Wully" make us realize in regard to Peter Rabbit is that psychotopography takes us only to a certain point in self-differentiation. In the Peter Rabbit tales, psychotopography not only differentiates the self. It also enables narrative speech; it allows one to tell stories in the first place. "Wully" and Call of the Wild suggest that temporal differentiation is even more fundamental in this respect: without temporal distinctions, the self cannot have a story, much less tell iL Rather than the psyche's relation purely to outside objects, Call of the Wild and "Wully" confront the psyche's relation to itself. London and Seton are not abandoning the project of self-differentiation but redirecting its focus ? from the outside to the inside, from consciousness's relation to the body to consciousness's relation to the mind. One way Seton draws our attention away from psychotopography is to depict the breakdown of the spatial relations upon which that model depends. What shocks Wully's master, Tom Dorley, is not that a fox is killing his livestock but the discovery that Wully himself is that fox. Dorley expects poaching from a fox, but not from his own sheepdog, because a sheepdog lives inside. The walls that differentiate domestic space would not necessarily be troubled if the "Mad Fox" crossed them. The fact that Wully himself is the Mad Fox suggests that psychotopography is useless when what seems not to be the self invades not just the home or the body but the psyche itself. Seton endorses a psychological understanding of Wully's madness when he describes Wully as a "Jekyll-Hyde dog" who lives "a double life" (Wild Animals 9,10). Like Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll, Wully possesses two personalities. Wully's personalities are not organized by place so much as by time: at night he kills livestock; during the day he is Dorley's faithful sheepdog. The dominance of either personality depends more on time than place. When he enters Dorley's house with a "strange gleam in his eye, and his jaws and snowy breast dashed with blood," it is clear that place no longer tells Wully who he is (247). Wully's execution at his master's hands dramatizes the destabilization of psychotopography: "Another quick blow scattered his brains on the hearth-stone, where so long he</page><page sequence="25">86 Victorian Review had been a faithful retainer ? and Wully, bright, fierce, trusty, treacherous Wully, quivered a moment, then straightened out and lay forever still" (249). As the emblematic repositories of psychic and domestic identity, brains and hearthstones coincide with a morbid vengeance. Territorial and psychic benchmarks, like the difference between "trusty" and "treacherous," have disappeared within the string of adjectives that describe Wully ("bright, fierce, trusty, treacherous") ? and are thus mixed up in Wully himself. It is as if the only way to straighten out this knot of adjectives and these ostensibly antithetical psychic qualities is to smash their repository (Wully's skull) and scatter its contents (his brains). The physicality of Peter's pressing against the garden door pales in comparison with this visceral dramatization of the crisis of differentiation. The excessive violence of Wully's death responds to more than the violation of physical and somatic boundaries. Tom Dorley "scatters [Wully's] brains" because the dog has disturbed not just Dorley's sense of place (this is my dog; this my house) but his sense of time and identity (my dog tonight is not the dog he was this morning, or even an hour ago). In disrupting Dorley's sense of the relationship between time and identity, Wully could be said to upset the topographic understanding of the psyche. Wully contradicts a homogeneous psychic model, because he suggests that two personalities can inhabit one psychic space. But Dorley's initial understanding of Wully is more profoundly temporal than spatial: Wully is a faithful sheepdog today and will continue to be so tomorrow. Wully's madness shatters the assumption that the psyche is automatically continuous. One can become (or find oneself) a person who seems to be not merely from another place (the wild, the world of poaching animals) but from another time. After all, Wully is not changing from who he is into who is he is not: he is the "Mad Fox." Wully changes ? and every night ? from who he is to who he has been. I do not mean by "who he has been" to call on the model of reversion, or regression to pure instinct. Wully cannot be said to revert, since he "goes wild" every night and then returns to his tame self the next morning. In Wully we witness what James calls "the phenomenon of alternating personality": "Any man becomes, as we say, inconsistent with himself if he forgets his engagements, pledges, knowledges, and habits; and it is merely a question of degree at what point we shall say that his personality is changed" (I: 379). The parts of the self (memories, ideas, perceptions) will understandably differ, but under all their differences they are knit in these two ways; and if either way of knitting disappears, the sense of unity departs. If a man wakes up some fine day unable to recall any of his past</page><page sequence="26">W.C. HARRIS 87 experiences, so that he has to learn his biography afresh, or if he only recalls the facts of it in a cold abstract way as things he is sure once happened; or if, without this loss of memory, his bodily and spiritual habits all change during the night, each organ giving a different tone, and the act of thought becoming aware of itself in a different way; he feels, and he says, that he is a changed person. He disowns his former me, gives himself a new name, identifies his present life with nothing from out of the older time. (I: 336)20 Not only does Wully wake up changed, he does so every morning. We have no evidence that Wully takes note of this change or is disoriented by the fact that he is not who he was yesterday. But the focus of the text is not Wully's consciousness but the effect that his transformation has on the household of which he is a member ? most specifically, on his master. Every story in Wild Animals I Have Known (the collection from which "Wully" comes) depicts the relationship between a man (sometimes the narrator) and an animal. If the animal is wild, the story concerns the success or failure of its domestication. If the animal is tame (as Wully is at the outset), then the story concerns the successful or failed maintenance of the domestic. In "Wully" especially, then, the force of Wully's change is exerted not so much on Wully as it is on the household, on his master. The master is the one who notices that Wully is not acting like himself. It is the master who, as James would have it, "wakes up" one day to find something that he thought of as "mine," as part of "me," to be, in fact, foreign. Just as for James one's possessions and companions are considered part of the self, part of who one is, Wully is part of his master. Wully kills Dorley's livestock; but that, like Wully's bloody demise (a disruption of his master's house), hypostatizes the disruption of his master's psyche. The domestic has suffered a "change during the night": what I thought mine is not; what I thought black is white. London's comment about one of Buck's fellow sled-dogs ("Something was wrong inside") might be applied to Wully as well as his master's house (43). If Wully's "going wild" resembles the Jamesian model of the self owning what it finds "warm" (James's synonym for "familiar"), then Tom Dorley's destruction of his dog is the extreme example of the psychic habit of continual self revision. Dorley is the Jamesian "/" discovering, perhaps to its chagrin, that "its me is only a loosely constructed thing, an identity On the whole,' just like that which any outside observer might find in the same assembling of facts" (I: 372-73). If the domestic ? and since this is the West, the domesticated ? can be agreed to involve a desire for regulation or stasis, then Wully brings the "vicissitudes in the me" to disturbing, ambulatory life (I: 371). To extend James's figure, it is if a neighbor has come into Dorley's house and said, "That chair ? that</page><page sequence="27">88 Victorian Review wasn't here the last time I was here, was it?" London's Buck, by contrast, will come to resemble the visitor who finds nothing amiss, who quickly assimilates the chair into the familiar when told, "I've had it up in the attic for years. I just never used it before." The idea of instinct becomes more interesting if we think of Wully's wolfishness psychologically ? as not something that is in his blood right now but something that his blood can remember. If wolfishness is something Wully remembers, then the problem is not so much distinguishing Wully from a wolf but, instead, distinguishing his present and past selves, organizing his memories and experiences into a coherent whole. If wolfishness is something Wully remembers rather than something he reverts to, then it is not the case that some alien personality has invaded his body. Rather, wolfishness is Wully's Mr. Hyde: like Hyde, wildness has been there all along. The chaos wrought by Wully's killing spree ? the chaos epitomized in his own death ? is Seton's way of suggesting the need for order, for ordering these selves that are both Wully ? in a word, for psychohistoriography. In comprehending, much less making a history of the self, one must take into account the passage of time, the relationship to memory, and the difference between experience and remembered experience. One can speak of the shift from topography to historiography as being a shift from the body to the mind ? from what can be known from the outside in (what bumps up against you) to what can be known, if at all, from the inside out (what bumps around inside you). But if Wully's going wild at night attests to his own psychohistoriographic labor (that of connecting his wild and his tame parts, or more accurately, wild and tame times), Wully's violent death marks his labor, his connected self, as unsuitable for domestic space. To enter and leave the house, he is using windows instead of doors. Using a door is not simply more civilized; doors have been agreed upon as the method of exit and entry; they signify the few points (locked and thus guarded doors) through which the domestic is accessible. If Wully has upset Dorley's sense of the relationship between identity and time, he has also violated his master's sense of the relationship between identity and space (domestic, in this case). Wully may have successfully sorted out his own psyche, but that success threatens the sense of identity that a stable domestic order provides, the rather static (and as in Peter Rabbit, repeated) derivation of a sense of self from familiar objects that are always in the same place. "Wully" is unlike Peter Rabbit in that identity can be derived temporally as well as spatially. To Dorley, Wully is not who he was yesterday; but he is also not where he was yesterday. That is, the correlation between who he is and where he is no longer exists. The psychotopographic foundation upon which domestic identity rests (and upon which its inhabitants' psychohistories can be</page><page sequence="28">W.C. HARRIS 89 erected) is graphically re-established when Dorley smashes Wully's skull on the hearth, which is perhaps the core of domestic space and thus identity. Seton's domestic space is even more limiting than Potter's garden in this way: psychic identity cannot become so portable (as it becomes for Wully) that it no longer requires, or worse, violates the physical boundaries which first differentiated it. For Seton, when you are cannot be allowed to detach itself from where you are. If it does, the price is violent disorder. For London's Buck, on the other hand, the price is not so dear, nor detachment so disruptive. Instead, history becomes a self-sufficient method of psychic accounting. Though not quite as morbidly vivid as "Wully," Call of the Wild also disables the spatial distinctions upon which psychotopography relies. Buck is abducted from his home in Sunland and sold north to meet the demand for sled-dogs occasioned by the Klondike Gold Rush. In the Yukon, snow and ice cover everything indiscriminately. Northland, as London calls it, is a mass of undifferentiated snow not unlike Potter's mass of undifferentiated bunnies.21 The Yukon has place names and trails, but these are only meaningful to Buck's masters. For Buck and the other dogs, there is only the sled, the traces; these exist everywhere, whatever the map may say. The text does not support the conclusion that the Yukon obliterates place altogether. Rather, Call's concern is much less the environment surrounding the psyche than the figurative, not fully mapped territories within it. The best we can say is that places in Northland lack reference for Buck; they have no specificity. Kidnapped, caged, transported far from Sunland in a dark train car, Buck is disoriented in the most fundamental sense. All his landmarks are gone. The map he had of Sunland is useless here. What psychohistoriography does is create a map that is good anywhere, because the psyche, unlike a landscape, travels with you. As in "Wully," temporal disorientation outstrips spatial disorientation, thereby calling for the chronological order psychohistoriography (and not psychotopography) can produce. Rather than clearly going wild, Buck, like Wully, has phases of wildness. And as with Wully, Buck's wildness violates assumptions about spatial differentiation. Even when the text calls him "a thing of the wild," he hovers between his "love-master" Thornton and his "wood brother" the wolf. Buck's crisscrossing "across the bleak divide," his vacillation between Jim Thornton and the wolves, blurs any clear spatial differentiation between forest and camp, between ostensibly more and less civilized territories (75).22 But Buck's "phases" ask to be read temporally as well as spatially. The word that leads us to consider the temporal dimension of Buck's journey is "instinct." The way we understand what London means by "instinct" is important, for it provides us with two very different critical options.</page><page sequence="29">90 Victorian Review The first option is to read Call of the Wild as a story about determinism. In such a reading Buck exemplifies the post-Darwinist notion of reversion. Evolutionists like Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer agree that adaptation is a response to environmental conditions and circumstance. Reversion is merely a logical corollary of evolutionary theory: if adaptation can be a progressive movement by which an organism evolves, can that movement not go the other way? Is it not possible for an organism to revert if its environment reverts to a former state?23 It is easy to read Buck's transplantation to Northland as an experiment designed to answer this question in the affirmative. Not much biology is required to know that the wolf is the genetic relative and undomesticated ancestor of the dog. Buck's journey from sled-dog to wolf is easily read, then, as reversion. In order to survive in the Yukon, Buck adapts to his new conditions: he submits to a beating when necessary; he remembers how to fight and steal when necessary. The reversionist reading is appealing and seems compatible with the text, but only insofar as we are accustomed to think of Call of the Wild and stories like it in deterministic terms (via Darwinism or its dubitable progeny, Social Darwinism).24 It is, of course, not inappropriate to think of London as belonging to the naturalist (or determinisi) school of American realism, for I am speaking of reversionism as a particular cast, one that is not exhaustive, of the determinisi position. But reading London this way does not account for the text's interest in psychic differentiation. The influence of Darwinism seems inescapable in criticism on London ? if not in criticism on American naturalism in general. While some critics such as Christopher Wilson (The Labor of Words: Literary Professionalism in the Progressive Era [Athens: U of Georgia P, 1985]) have attempted to recontextualize naturalist texts, a blunt brand of Darwinism still wields critical influence. Earle Labor speaks for many of this school when he asserts Call's "theme of hereditary and environmental determinism" as something so obvious as to be taken for granted (116). Critics who favor a reversionist account of London's novel are liable to disagree on whether Buck is meant as a warning (that men are not far from being beasts, if they are not already beasts) or as an exhortation (that we should emulate Buck and live fiercely and in response to our circumstances). But all reversionist critics essentially read Call as a translation of Darwin and Spencer into fiction; this approach might be labeled "literal Darwinism" (Allen 79).25 A closer examination of Call, however, suggests that reversion is manifestly wrong as a description of Buck's transformation. Buck must come to terms with more than an inhospitable climate, harsh masters, and "the law of club and fang" (15). Like Wully, Buck is overcome with feelings that initially seem foreign to him. But Buck does</page><page sequence="30">W.C. HARRIS 91 not so much become wild as remember what it is (or rather, was) to be wild: instincts long dead became alive again. The domesticated generations fell away from him. In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of his breed, to the time when the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest. . . . [F]orgotten ancestors . . . quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been his always. ... Thus, as a token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again. . .. (22-23; emphases added) The suggestion is that Buck's new feelings are not new because they are the experience of others but new because they are "his own," experiences which were never not his but which were only forgotten to be his, to belong to him. That is, they merely seem new. The word "new" is not applicable after their recognition. The Call of the Wild confuses the body not only with others' bodies but also with one's body in the past ? a body that seems to be another's precisely because it existed in the past. This is a diachronic rather than a synchronie problem: the erasure of the temporal division between selves. Buck does not attempt to separate the dog he is from the dogs he might have been, nor the dog he is from the dogs he might be. Buck does not suffer from Peter Rabbit's solipsism ? far from it. Things that seem outside the self come to be understood as parts of the self, and so to redefine a notion of outsideness. The key word in the preceding passage is "instinct." It is indisputable that these "instincts" come to feel natural to Buck. He comes to feel them as part of himself. "Instinct" does not seem meant to refute a savage/civilized paradigm but, in fact, to mark the shift from psychotopography to psychohistoriography. Richard Fusco argues against a primitivist or reversionist reading when he suggests that to speak of Buck's joining his "wood brother[s]" as reversion is to deny that the move from his human master Thornton to the wolf pack is a transition from one "sort of family" to another (76). Richard Fusco's argument against reversion is an attempt to redress primitivist readings of Rousseau as well as London. In rejecting the reversionist reading, Fusco also questions the binary savage/civilized paradigm according to which both authors have been read. For Rousseau, Fusco suggests, the paradigm is comprised of four phases, including transition, rather than two absolute opposites. In arguing against reversion, both Fusco and I are reading against London's private statement that he wrote Call to</page><page sequence="31">92 Victorian Review depict "the devolution or decivilization of a dog" (Letters 166; cited in Fusco 79n). The reversionist account sustains another blow if we look outside of Call to White Fang (1907). This later novel continues Buck's story: it opens by describing a pack of wild dogs that seem to be sled-dogs gone wild. White Fang controverts the notion of reversion by describing the passage of a dog from the wild to the domestic, rather than the reverse. If reversion is meant to complicate a savage/civilized paradigm, then reversion cannot be the case in White Fang. The lack of any boundary for White Fang to re-cross would render impossible the novel's final debate between the contentions that he "is not all wolf and that "a wolf is a wolf (275). If there were not still some sense of troubled boundaries, then the Judge's wife could not call White Fang a "Blessed Wolf (283). White Fang's journey from wild to civilized undoes the force of "reversion": Call of the Wild is a tale of going wild but White Fang is a tale of "going civilized." The point is not the romantic primitivist point ? namely, that Buck's transformation is progressive rather than regressive. Since White Fang moves from being an Arctic wolf to being a household pet, White Fang might be subtitled "The Call of the Domesticated." If, then, dogs are able to come and go, and if families exist in the wild as well as in civilization, understanding Buck's heeding of "instinct" as reversion is at odds with the text. Of course, London at moments encourages determinist readings, by suggesting that Buck is reverting, that is, recalling or becoming something he is not: "the fear of the wild thing for the trap . . . was a token [that Buck] was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forbears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it" (18-19). But for James every self that is not the present one (what he calls "Thought") is a "forbear." Buck's change at times may seem sudden and complete: "He was not homesick. The Sunland was very dim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things that he had never seen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again" (41). It is necessary to remember that these "instincts" are also "memories." They are still admitted as part of the self (not wholly disowned like the Wully that had been). Heredity is also striking because James speaks of the present self inheriting all the past selves and what they considered theirs: "Each Thought is thus born an owner, and dies owned, transmitting whatever it realized as its Self to its own later proprietor" (I: 339). The self is a legacy: "I" continue to inherit the accretion of "me" that "I" consider and own as, "my" Self. On the subject of</page><page sequence="32">W.C. HARRIS 93 instinct, James is clear that instincts, regarded as automatic, inherent responses, do not exist: A very common way of [animals'] admirably definite tendencies to act is by naming abstractly the purpose they subserve, such as self preservation. ... But this represents the animal as obeying abstractions which not once in a million cases is it possible it can have framed. ... The actions we call instinctive all conform to the general reflex type; they are called forth by determinate sensory stimuli.... ( : 383-84) Any instinct with which an animal is born is modified by the first situation in which the animal acts upon it, and it will continued to be modified (II: 390). Instincts are, for James and for Buck, "transistor[y]"; they fade away as habits form; they are not then, in the reversionist sense of genetically inherent behavior patterns, instincts at all. The examples cited from London might appear not to support my reading at all but actually to endorse the conventional determinist reading. Denying the determinist charge of London's work would be neither useful nor feasible, and is not my intention. I am arguing instead for a discernment, within the blunt category of determinism, of finer distinctions, of affiliations to (or at least concerns in common with) the psychological phenomenalism of James that was just as contemporary as Spencer's reversionist theories (see Naso 13-16). Besides, other passages in Call imply that Buck is not changing into something that he is not but rather realizing the continuity between what he had thus far considered himself and other selves that seem equally as present, as "warm," to him. For example, when Buck attacks another dog, we are informed of Buck's transformation from gentility to virility in terms that thwart the notion that such a transformation is complete: "Buck was inexorable [in attacking another dog]. Mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes" (36). The word that sticks out here is "reserved." If mercy is reserved, then it is not gone; it is not forgotten. By that logic, neither were the forbears. It is valid, then, to argue that Call of the Wild is not so interested in biological reversion as it is in psychological continuity. For James, and for a growing number of psychologists after him, psychology was inextricable from physiology. An account based solely on one or the other was flawed; and that would seem to apply to the determinism invoked by many London critics (rather than formulated by Spencer, say). The point of Call or "Wully" is not that "we and the beasts are kin"; neither text seems bent on analyzing the difference or similarity between species, nor in questioning the difference between man and beast. I take the central issue in these texts to be the differentiation of</page><page sequence="33">94 Victorian Review psychic space. The reason these authors use animal protagonists, as well as troubling temporal distinctions, is to counteract the underlying bias of psychic formation ? namely, the valorization of the present over the past, the temporally proximate over the temporally distant. The physical relations so central to Peter Rabbit have not been so much abolished as they have been subsumed under what London and Seton see as the temporal differentiation which is essential to the psychohistoriographic project of comprehending the self as having a yesterday and a today, as having a story. The episode of Buck's dream is the most strongly psychohistoriographic moment in the Call of the Wild. The dream directs Buck's (and our) attention to what seems outside the self because it is so temporally distant. Buck dreams that he is the dog of a troglodyte ? a dream that blurs the synchronie distinction between his (dog) self and other selves (prehistoric wolves as he imagines them). Buck's dream exemplifies the historiographie project in describing both the necessity of arranging one's memories and experiences into a continuous history of the self, and the difficulty of doing so. But London describes the dream as a recollection, as Buck's remembering something that happened to him rather than imagining what happened to someone else: Sometimes as [Buck] crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another different man from the half-breed cook before him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm, with muscles that were stringy and knotty[,]... hair ... long and matted, and ... head slanted.... He was all but naked, a ragged ... skin hanging part way down his back..., ... And beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many gleaming coals, two by two ... the eyes of great beasts of prey. . . . And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes gleaming at the fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end ... till he whimpered . . . suppressedly, or growled softly, and the half-breed cook shouted at him, "Hey you Buck, wake up!" Whereupon the other world would vanish and the real world came into his eyes, and he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep. (41-42; emphasis added) At first glance the passage seems to hover between dreaming and waking states. "Blinking dreamily" in the opening line is contradicted by the last phrase, "as though he had been asleep." The image of the troglodyte becomes more and more vivid in the first paragraph until</page><page sequence="34">W.C. HARRIS 95 "dreaming there by the Yukon bank" jarringly reminds us ? and even Buck ? that he is dreaming. But is he actually dreaming? Phrases like "flames of another fire" and "the other world" lend a reality and a presence to the caveman and Buck's intimacy with him. If Buck is not quite dreaming, then what is he doing? "Blinking dreamily" seems to describe what Buck is doing: seeing, but unclearly, looking at something which seems familiar and yet alien. The reversionist interpretation would suggest that Buck is experiencing a kind of instinctual onset. But biological, deterministic terminology seems to complicate the issue by placing Darwinism between us and the text. To state it most simply, Buck is remembering. I would not say that memory is the psychological equivalent of instinct, for that would only be substituting terms. Buck is discovering where and when he ends, and what seems like primordial instinct is in fact memory; what seems like "genetic recall" is the active comprehension of the temporally distant as part of memory, as part of one's past and therefore part of oneself. As with London, James's sense of the self comes as much from the inside as the outside. What James calls "personal identity" arises from the self's attempt and ability to know itself as a continuous object: "The sense of personal identity is not . . . [the] mere synthetic form essential to all thought. It is the sense of a sameness perceived by thought and predicated of things thought-about. These things are a present self and a self of yesterday. The thought not only thinks them both, but thinks that they are identical" (I: 333). James's description of this mode of psychic differentiation could easily be a description of Buck dreaming by the fire: [T]he distant selves appear to our thought as having for hours of time been continuous with each other, and most recent ones of them continuous with the Self of the present moment.[I] spite of changes of structure, it exists continuously before our eyes.. . . Continuity makes us unite what dissimilarity might otherwise separate; similarity makes us unite what discontinuity might hold apart. ... Peter, awakening in the same bed with Paul, and recalling what both had in mind before they went to sleep, reidentifies and appropriates the "warm" ideas as his, and is never tempted to confuse them with those cold and pale-appearing ones which he ascribes to Paul. As well might he confound Paul's body, which he only sees, with his own body, which he sees but also feels. Each of us when he awakens says, Here's the same old self again, just as he says, Here's the same old bed, the same old room, the same old world. (I: 334)</page><page sequence="35">96 Victorian Review The self is conceived of as extending not simply over space but over time: I am me not because my desk is not me, but rather, I am me because I have a number of recollections that seem to be mine. The self is constituted by its psychic cohesion and continuity over time. For Buck, his so-called prehistoric self feels as warm as his present, civilized self. Both are close to the same fire, the same center of consciousness, the Jamesian "Thought" that says, "Yes, both of these seem to belong to me." Countering that dreaming is not believing is a false move. By James's account, however foreign the dream, however much it may seem part of someone else's life (like Paul's, above), "any distant self that possesses a "glow and a warmth" is taken as a possession, as a part, of the self (1:333). Reading for allegory and determinism, Earle Labor ignored Buck's dream, in which London revises the deterministic understanding of "instinct" by dramatizing the presence of such impulses to the self. The dream scene implies that Buck's "instincts" are not genetic and therefore automatically experienced but rather psychic and therefore experienced only in the organization of disjunct impressions and recollections into a self. Because these impressions may be from different times and may be of externally different selves, the psychohistoriographic self is coherent only insofar as all these impressions seem to be one's own ? that is, to form a discernible narrative of one self. Disengaging from the reversionist model allows us to see that Buck's change is an active engagement with these "instincts" rather than a passive relapse into inherited behavior. Jonathan Auerbach reminds us that "Buck must learn to be wild. Wildness ... is not simply a state of nature to be gained by a reversion to type, as the natural plot of primordial atavism would have it. Attaining wildness entails disciplined education .. ." (55-56). Buck works very hard, but not only in the traces. He labors at his new sense of himself ? he actively engages with new urges and thoughts: sometimes he resists; sometime he obeys.26 Buck is learning something, certainly, and learning it by engaging with it: what he is learning and engaging with are the labor of making a history of the self. As I have suggested, this labor of sorting out oneself from other selves entails the delineation of the self over time ? the recognition that the self is made up of different senses, understandings, memories of who one is. This is the labor of psychohistoriography. The implication in Call, as in the Principles, would be that memories, past understandings of oneself, as well as understandings of oneself in the past are all inside the self. The inability to distinguish past and present, memory and experience, may be a problem, but that is what you have to deal with in making a history of the self, in telling what sets you</page><page sequence="36">W.C. HARRIS 97 apart as a self. It may seem so, if we are inured to psychotopographic ways of thinking (thinking of the self only in the present and in relation to externals). Thinking of the self as an entity continuous over time and defined by die relation of its internal, past and present experiences is the mode into which Call of the Wild pushes Buck and the reader. Buck comes to identify not so much with a generalized self like Emerson's Over-Soul but instead with a self that transcends the present moment. The figure of Buck and the troglodyte peering into the darkness epitomizes the text's psychohistoriographic focus on the self in relation to itself rather than to what is outside itself. When London writes of "instinct" he is talking about memory and active psychohistoriography ? instead of genetics and passive reversion. If the dream passage depicts reversion at all, reversion is stamped psychologically rather than biologically. It seems an odd way to speak of reversion to say that Buck "remembers back to the youth of his breed." If London is talking about memory, it seems more appropriate to say that Buck remembers back to his own youth. Coming "into his own again" suggests that these memories are part of his psyche rather than a part of his genes. Likewise, the troglodyte Buck sees by the fire in place of the cook is not the cook's ancestor but rather part of him: the troglodyte is the fearful, brutal man the cook has been or can become. Experiencing memories that seem to be someone else's suggests the need for self differentiation. Psychohistoriography tells Buck that, on the contrary, these memories are not anyone else's; they are his. What feels foreign and prehistoric comes to be understood as an intimate though forgotten part of the self. The prehistoric quality of Buck's memories does more than literalize deterministic truisms about genetics, instinct, and inherited memories. The fact that Buck's memories seem prehistoric to him drives home the fact that, without psychohistoriography, yesterday and last week would be as distant to the self as the Stone Age. My reluctance to read animal stories anthropomorphically or allegorically stems from my sense that such techniques prove blunt and unuseful when they elide themes ? like psychic differentiation ? in which the dividing line between man and beast is of less interest than the line between the self and environment or the lines that connect everything within the self (the self's internal landscape). Just as I suggest that psychohistoriography blurs a undisputed sense of self, Auerbach suggests that the "rhetorical effects" by which London represents "animal... consciousness" problematize a binary man/beast paradigm (53). Auerbach resists allegorical interpretation because it neglects the fact that "we continue to imagine [Buck] as a dog despite all his complex mental attributes" (55). I prefer the psychohistoriographic model because it gets at the way London's text</page><page sequence="37">98 Victorian Review works to obscure distinctions (psychic rather than biological) that are inaccurately imagined as "natural" and inalienable. The type of critical looseness inspired by allegorical reading is epitomized by Earle Labor and Maxwell Geismar. Labor seconds Geismar's description of Call as a "parable of the buried impulses" with his own comment: "We need only interpolate that these 'buried impulses' are essentially human, not canine, and that readers identify more closely than they may imagine with [Buck]" (Geismar ; Labor 119). Here allegory has become liberating because it allows us to identify with Buck and therefore to overturn assumptions about who we are as civilized humans. But losing a sense of who you are is not a triumph but a crisis in Call of the Wild, nor is it a journey from man to beast. Rather than being the objective of Call of the Wild, identification is the crisis against which Buck struggles for differentiation. Identification merges the self with something larger than the self, whereas Buck works at differentiating himself by identifying not with other selves but with other parts (memories, experiences) of himself. The fact that these other parts of himself initially seem to be other selves conveys the novel's nuanced assessment and rejection of identification in favor of differentiation and psychohistoriography. Refusing to impose a deterministic reading on Call of the Wild thus directs us to the psychohistoriographic enterprise implied by "instinct." Instinct for London evokes the disorientation not of the civilized man confronted with his own inner wildness, but of the self confronted with his own inner difference in attempting to forge a unified understanding of himself over time ? to forge a history. As with Peter Rabbit, I think Call and "Wully" are interesting as investigations of attempts at psychic differentiation, depictions of the self attempting to know itself. If one begins talking about men and beasts, then there seems to be little difference among animal stories. All animal stories are about animals; and, whether they include human characters as well, most of these stories make some point about animals in relation to man ? if in relation only to the narrator and/or author. Reading "instinct" in a different way is more productive since it follows a textual lead away from differences between primitive and civilized (which Buck's answer to "the call" complicates) and toward the more nuanced, impending problem of connecting one's present to one's past. My reading, of course, cannot take shelter in the intentional fallacy any more than can the conventional reversionist reading. Further, a Jamesian reading of London has no purchase merely in common words and concepts. But a Jamesian reading better accommodates the text's and Buck's own movement, which is not the bait-and-switch of the reversionist model but rather a finer and repeated motion. Buck finally heeds "the call" and leaves his master, but only after crossing and re-crossing the "bleak</page><page sequence="38">W.C. HARRIS 99 divide." Like the man/beast paradigm, that of civilized/savage is a "bleak divide": too blunt to be useful, but, when maintained as a base line, capable of being refined and sophisticated. Throwing away the reversionist interpretation is less useful, and less true to Call of the Wild, than retaining it as one piece in the moves between extremes in the nearer approach to more detailed self-awareness. IV The preceding may still not have answered the pressing question for any treatment of the animal story: Why write about animals? In this case, what does the man/beast paradigm convey about certain protocols of self-differentiation (proposed by James, then deployed by Potter, London, and Seton) that is not already clear, or might not be made clear in another genre (without animals) or through human characters? If the anthropomorphic question is not at issue, why does Peter seem so much like a disobedient child? If Potter's characters customarily wear clothes, then how are they any different from humans? And what, then, is the point of retaining the one jarring dissimilarity of species? It seems even less necessary that Buck be canine instead of human. Stories of a man's (re)discovery of his so-called primitive side have been told before. But, if the point about animal stories is more than supporting or denying that "we and the beasts are kin," then why choose a genre that focuses on precisely that differential? One answer would be that the crudeness of the man/beast paradigm serves as an analogy for the initial impression of the self (me/not-me) which must be made and yet incessantly revised. James's passage on "THE INTELLECTUAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BRUTE AND MAN" (an initially broad distinction) is the backdrop for his discussion of the self's ability to move beyond such "cut-and-dried thinking" to increasingly complex, more qualified discriminations (II: 348). We have already noted that the Jamesian self is "a loosely constructed thing" subject to "vicissitudes" (I: 372, 371). That is, what I think of as "me" or "mine" is apt to change from day to day. As long as the "I" which surveys my memories (who "me" was yesterday, the day before, and so on) remains a constant "core" amid the shifting "stream of consciousness," and as long as some of what was "me" yesterday and the day before still seems like mine (that is, is recognized to have my "warmth" on it), then I can be said to be "the same self that I was yesterday" The self can under these conditions be said to remain constant enough to be justifiably called the "same self." Given the Jamesian proposition that the self is reconstructed each day (if not each present moment), a self altered to a certain degree is recognizable as "the same old me" (as in Buck's case), whereas any self altered</page><page sequence="39">100 Victorian Review beyond that extent (Wully) cannot be recognized as anything but an utterly changed me, an alternate personality (thus the Jekyll-and-Hyde paradigm). Certainly in Jamesian terms, the self would never be differentiated at the same point twice, in quite the same way, or along the same set of axes. Thus psychic differentiation carves out nothing like a cube or sphere so much as a very uneven shape, thinner in some places, wider in others. James was cited above in regard to the filaments sent out by the self to what it considers its domain. But when dealing with the self we ... are dealing with a fluctuating material. The same object may be treated as a part of me, at other times as simply mine, and then again as if I had nothing to do with it at all. In its widest possible sense, however, a man's Self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank account. All these things give him the same emotions. (I: 291) The Principles speaks of levels of the self, or of what is considered at different times the self. The man/beast differential, which seems as simplistic as it does intuitive, could be said to analogize, to serve as a figure for a similar line that no two psyches call the same, or even that any one psyche lays consistently in the same configuration: "it is clear that between what a man calls me and what he simply calls mine the line is difficult to draw" (I: 291). Clearly when we are trying to tell selves or species apart, we are in the realm of "differential discrimination," or discrimination "with reference to what is there" rather than what is absent (only present in memory). Having both X and Y before us, we can sort out the relation between them. But, if the self is as subject to vicissitudes as James proposes, and if it is difficult to consistently deny or assert man's kinship with the beasts, then having all the cards on the table is not in itself a boon. What is needed is some way of separating the wheat from the chaff, so to speak ? some means of differentiating less bluntly. How can I express my sense that X is like Y in some ways, but not in others, or not at certain times? Given the "fluctuating" nature of the self, how can alliances be articulated in a more nuanced and flexible manner? For James the solution is "the law of dissociation by varying concomitants": "What is associated now with one thing and now with another tends to become dissociated from either, and to grow into an object of abstract contemplation by the mind" (I: 506). By this process, sensations and perceptions are stored, recalled, sorted, correlated and distinguished, and thereby the life of a self is enabled. The "juxtaposition of similars" in order to sort out what is different</page><page sequence="40">W.C HARRIS 101 within those larger similarities allows the "mind ... to analyze [the dissociated element] out of a total, whenever it meets with it again" (I: 506). But this is precisely what James says the "brute beast" cannot do. What defines man is that he can re-learn, dissociate some terms from a manifold (an experience), and reassemble an idea of part of that experience. This is the model of forming and re-forming ideas ? a shifting and recalculating that seems to be at work in these contemporary animal stories. At the simplest level, the genre of the animal story seems concerned with both allying and distinguishing the animal and the human. The "brute beast" cannot discriminate as well as man because, when faced with X and Y, he cannot discriminate ? that is, cannot abstract ? what they have in common or what makes them different. Animals seem unable to sift out what is constant from what changes ? either the me's of yesterday and today from the "I" that acknowledges them both as "mine," or the many times I have gone to the hospital from the few times I been anesthetized. For the animal, "thoughts will not . . . call up their similars, but only their habitual successors. Sunsets will not suggest heroes' deaths, but supper-time" (II: 353). This might explain why Peter must repeatedly return to the garden and get caught: for Peter (as for any animal in James), any constant in a series of contexts goes unnoticed, because it is swallowed up in the concrete particulars of each situation. Thinking the self as thinking produces a fanning out of the self (all the self claims, from body to house to reputation), rather than a simple me/not-me antithesis. There is a gray area, in other words: all that is me-ish not just in space but in time. For Peter, there is one self, one world; for Buck and Wully, one world, many selves that are all part of one self (all me's). The conclusion that can be made at least about the texts of Potter, London, and Seton is that the man/beast differential is a necessary base from which to complicate the binary pairs into which thought tends to fall. From this baseline, more differentiations can be made ? both in kind and in degree; more nuanced or just as simplistic. In other words, with the one opposition in place, distinctions can be subsequently broken and undone, those divisions re-assigned in different places and in less absolute terms. The animal story (with the implicit man/beast paradigm) maintains the poles by which discrimination operates. The difficulty of the man/beast distinction ? the fact that it always ends up being made and unmade and qualified ? resonates, in these stories, with a self that either can or cannot adapt to new circumstances. Wully and Buck exemplify the failed and successful project of making, re distinguishing and re-negotiating the self moment after moment. Peter exemplifies the self able to make (or concentrating on making only) distinctions in the here and now. Peter gains a sense of himself, but only</page><page sequence="41">102 Victorian Review for a moment, because there is only the moment. What one might call Peter's forgetfulness resembles what James calls the "fundamental defect" of the animal mind: "the inability of their groups of ideas to break across in unexpected places. [Animals] are enslaved to routine, to cut-and-dried thinking..." (II: 353). The man/beast paradigm would be an example of what can either be "cut-and-dried thinking" or the first layer of a palimpsest of distinctions. For all the finer gradations made in each of these animal stories, however, the psychotopographic and psychohistoriographic models should not be regarded as separate or antithetical. They are one in James; they are part of one organism, one epigensis. The blurring action of the Principles suggests these protocols are not as antagonistic as they might seem. Potter, London, and Seton, on the other hand, dissociate two distinct modes of differentiation out of the Jamesian system, removing them from the continuum in which James locates them. If James is correct, then we ourselves dissociate and discriminate, as just described. Therefore, crude distinctions like man/beast are no more impervious to revision than me/not-me. They seem to encourage revision, taking new stock of the altering landscape that is the psyche. Further, a Jamesian reading of these animal stories suggests a contemporary concern with the problem of distinction (how permanent is it? how finely can it be made?) and with how the terms of distinction (me/not-me, man/beast) seem sadly in need of revision or sophistication but also seem necessary to make and perhaps impossible to make, at least provisionally, in any other terms. Both the Principles and the self differentiating experiences of Peter, Wully, and Buck suggest that, because selves and species are not simply identical or completely dissimilar, many differentiations and many alliances need to be made, but across more complicated lines than a simple axis. We return again to the perennial question of animal story criticism: why animals? Why write about animals if the story could just as well be told about humans or is read as really being about humans? Because, the differential charge set up across the man/beast and author/character divide is only an apparent differential: it gets sustained by the story, but fragments, gets crossed and transmogrified. It holds up a grade across which difference and similarity can be sustained in a way that is not binaristic or even dialectical (that is, there is no outcome), so that only adjustments can be continuously made. That is the movement of the James text and the animal stories both. The claims here are made only for James, Potter, London, and Seton, and only for the period that might be located "on the cusp" of Victorianism (1890-1904) ? a period punctuated by a renaissance of the animal story, the explosion of Anglo-American psychology, and an interdisciplinary concern with the viability of a certain model of self-differentiation in national and cultural</page><page sequence="42">W.C. HARRIS 103 environments that frustrated such a project. Extrapolating the claim to other texts and periods (of animal stories) seems possible but must be done with the same care that these authors tread a landscape riddled with the pitfalls of absolutes and absolute difference. The critical ground is likely to "break across in unexpected places"; our critical terms, break into unexpectedly altered ones. Notes I can only admit my debt to the following for their comments, encouragement, and refusal to accept the less than coherent: Judith Harris, Jenifer Karyshyn, Marianne Leonard, Walter Benn Michaels, Maurice Oakley, Mary Poovey, and Katherine von Goeler. (Abbreviations are used for two texts: LWJ = Letters of William James; LHJ = Letters of Henry James. Volume number references without any additional notation refer to the Principles.) 1. My own reading is no less psychological than Swinfen's or Gose's. If anything, this paper is more psychological in its attention to the specific psychic operations at work in Peter Rabbit, "Wully," and Call of the Wild. For more conventional accounts of the psychological value of animal/fantasy stories, see Swinfen (12-18) and Gose (3-16). Let us for the time being accept Seton's contention that animal stories are conducive to narratives of psychic differentiation. Even if Seton is right, how are we to read psychologically London's, Potter's, and his own use of animals to narrate psychic phenomena? Are animal stories (these three, at least) cases of displacement? That is, are authors and/or narrators only projecting what are distinctly human problems onto animals? Since I am, like Seton unable to translate "from rabbit into English," I decline to diagnose or even allege displacement, as if it were some literary-ethical offense. London's, Seton's, and Potter's use of animals seems instead to thematize the problem itself: one way to speak of the problem of telling who one is, is to speak of someone else. Animals seem as much like us and also as different from us as two selves can be. 2. In this regard, my use of the first person throughout this paper is meant merely to clarify theoretical positions by giving them body; this body and this "I" are not transcendental, anmropomoiphic, or species-identified. 3. The Principles beg and yet frustrate differentiation on the additional fronts of genre and discipline. Though the product of a professor of psychology, and consequently adopted as a college textbook in psychology courses, the Principles is, in the words of George Santayana, "a work of the imagination . . . a literary subject, like autobiography or psychological fiction, and can be treated only poetically" (41; emphases added). Also, James's later interest in what would now be called paranormal phenomena evokes a man who continued to be uncomfortable with the generic, professional, and intellectual</page><page sequence="43">104 Victorian Review categories imposed and the. accompanying differentiations demanded by his society and his discipline. 4. For James psychic differentiation first and most powerfully stems from the empirical contrast of somatic and extra-somatic boundaries, the brute bodily distinction of "me" from "not-me," and "in here*' from "out there." He holds that psychic life is bodily at the most fundamental level. Knowing myself is inextricable from sensing and knowing what my desk is (knowing it is "not-me" in a bodily sense and yet "me" in the "material" sense of being mine): "The experiences of the body are . . . one of the conditions of the faculty of memory being what it is. ... If the nervous communication be cut off between the brain and other parts [of the body], the experiences of those other parts are non-existent for the mind" (I: 4). Not to experience my desk is also not to be aware of the "I" experiencing it 5. Call and "Wully" could be said to split hairs even further by presenting, respectively, the success and failure of psychohistoriography (the failure looking something like multiple personality disorder). In the Principles, what I have distinguished as two models shade into one another, according to James, in a developmental continuum. The first (psychotopography) appears an initial, infant or primitive stage, whereas the second model is the more developed, introspective stage (the self thinking itself a thinker as opposed to the self viscerally experiencing itself). Nevertheless, each model is visible by itself in each of these animal stories. The fact that these models do exist on a continuum ? often side by side or in tandem ? is an issue to take up (for it elides difference even further), but only once the models and texts themselves have been examined. 6. I am paraphrasing James's phrase, " think ourselves as thinkers" (I: 296). More than a loose notion of self-contemplation, James intends a specific operation by which the self sorts out what belongs to itself from what does not, as well as what constitutes the "core" of itself, the constant in the "stream of consciousness," from its passing thoughts and the possessions it considers part of the "social" Self (one's family or reputation). James distinguishes between the subjective and objective aspects of the self: what he calls the "I" and the "ME." The I-self, as Susan Harter puts it, is "the knower, the active agent responsible for constructing the Me-self . . . [which] organized and interpreted one's experiences" (1). The Me-self is that "object of the I-self*s creation" (2). In the Me-self, James distinguishes between the material Self (my body and all that I call mine), the social Self (how others see me), and the spiritual Self (that part of me which remains more or less constant among the "vicissitudes" of first two Selves) (I: 371). This Jamesian notion of a hierarchical, multidimensional self is the model that followers of James have continued to experiment with, revise, and simplify or complicate. Others, like Mark Freeman, have taken up the Jamesian notion of a narrative self: besides constructing its "me," the "I" constructs a narrative of the self's diachronic continuity. The majority of self-concept studies have</page><page sequence="44">W.C. HARRIS 105 elaborated on either the hierarchical or the narrative self, viewing as antithetical two modes of self-awareness which James himself posits as continuous, even simultaneous, within one's psychic life. Bruce Bracken's Handbook (from which Harter is cited) contains the fullest account of the history and experimental practice of the study of self differentiation that claims descent from the Jamesian model. Brinthaupt and Lipka's volume, while less of a survey than Bracken's, contains an equally sharp delineation of major positions within the field, especially the narrative hierarchical split (Mark Freeman 15-43; Herbert W. Marsh, Barbara M. Byrne, and Richard J. Shavelson, 44-95). It should be made clear that these studies are Jamesian, or see themselves as working territory laid out by the Principles. My reference to them, as well as the paper as a whole, is not intended to be at all exhaustive of the topic of self-differentiation. Even within the Jamesian model, I am focusing, for example, on the "material Self' and not the "social Self (the self as constituted and affected by social interaction). Many models of identity have been put forth more recently (deconstructionist, feminist, and queer theory, to name a few), and such models would seem to loom over any discussion like this one. I do not engage with recent theories of identity for the same reason I do not engage with non-Jamesian models of self-differentiation: that is simply not my focus. I am interested in a very specific model of psychic awareness (James's) and how its concerns (how differentiation can and cannot be accomplished) were also the concerns of contemporary animal stories, texts already generically predisposed to the question of differentiation in a very problematic form (man's difference from or similarity to "lower animals"). James, Potter, London, and Seton possess the "benefit" (longed for by William's brother Henry) of "managing ... to be on the spot," to be at the site of an interdisciplinary, intergeneric debate about difference: where it matters and where it cannot exist (LHL I: 419). 7. James's own account of the me/not-me opposition can be found in the chapter of the Principles entitled "The Consciousness of Self* (I: 291-401). 8. It is important to note mat, for James, psychic awareness never transcends bodily awareness: even the "Spiritual Self* is "felt. . . . When it is found, it is felv, just as the body is felt, the feeling of which is also an abstraction, because never is the body felt all alone, but always together with other things" (I: 299). 9. In order to strengthen or qualify this hypothesis, further analysis is necessary ? in particular, other contemporary animal stories (beginning with, but not limited to, the years 1898-1908). The period of the animal story "boom" could no doubt be widened by looking at works anterior to Seton's (such as Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and Kipling's Just So Stories) as well as works following London's (such as Kenneth Granarne*s The Wind in the Willows). Potter's tales themselves deserve more attention to determine more precisely the relation of clothes to psychotopography.</page><page sequence="45">106 Victorian Review 10. While such a debate can only be inferred from its presence in these four texts, differentiation was a noted crisis within the James family. The split articulated by Potter on the one hand and London and Seton on the other (that is, between psychotopography and psychohistoriography) suggestively matches the rift, the "divided soul" that William James found within himself (LWJ I: 347). He suffered the ambiguous sense of national identity common to his family: "if it is good to have one foot in England, it is still better, or at least as good to have the other out of it" (Perry I: 390). As much as James himself switched sides in the family debate (Europe versus America), the Principles' systematization of psychic differentiation suggests that, unlike his brother Henry, William James was not satisfied with the notion of a "big Anglo American total, destined to such an amount of melting together" as to erase difference (LHJ I: 141). If William James's was a "divided soul," he preferred to know exactly how it was divided. However nebulous the distinction may have been in his own mind, he recognized the topographical dissimilarities of England and America. America was a "human vacuum," a land of "rocky vaguenesses and Arcadian 'nowheres'" (LWJ II: 241; LHJ II: 135). In contrast to "wild American country," William complained of a "European landscape ... so fenced or planted that you can't lie down and sprawl" (LWJ II: 158). For William James, difference must be made because it brings "comfort and order" (LWJ I: 347); it brings with it the stability of history, of already being-written that both brothers associated with England, but which America as yet lacked. Lacking boundaries was both to be corrected and enjoyed by the American writer, if not all Americans. For Henry it allowed things to be said (whereas Europe's tombs, its age, its storied quality, made new words unnecessary). For William it required that boundaries be set, that words be written ? a difficult task in the Yukon of London's Call of the Wild or the limitless plains of Seton's American West. Different spaces and varied topographies demand different techniques of differentiation. The Principles, then, as refracted by the American tales of Seton and London on the one hand and the English tale of Potter on the other, suggest that ? although these may be viewed, with Henry, simply as "different chapters of the same general subject" ? the grammar of the American and the English chapters obey different laws of syntax (LHJ I: 141-42). From the strictly geographic to the more generally cultural, the Old and the New World presented the self with radically opposite conditions and consequently demanded techniques of differentiation appropriate to each environment. The ambiguities that frustrate yet invite the discrimination of national (and implicitly, psychic) spaces resonate with the two models of differentiation discernible in the Principles. 11. This paper differs from much previous criticism in its focus on the animal story and in its contention that these three texts symptomatize a concern about self-differentiation common to English and American animal stories at</page><page sequence="46">W.C. HARRIS 107 the turn of the twentieth century. My generic focus on the animal story is specialized, in comparison with previous criticism. Anthologies and critical works alike often consider the animal story a subgenre of children's literature, and lump animals stories together with stories about children or adults. (Margaret Blount is one of the few critics to deal specifically with the animal story as a genre in its own right.) But animal stories have a history distinct from that of children's literature ? or at least their respective industries do. The industry of children's literature in the West is generally agreed to begin in 1744 (Darton 7; Hunt 1). Before that date, children read either educational tracts specifically aimed at them or primer versions of adult's books (Hunt 2-12). (For detailed accounts of the didactic or pietistic aim of eighteenth-century children's literature, consult Sloane and Summerf?eld; for direct access of chapbooks of the period, see Ashton. A contemporary lack of interest in the animal story is suggested by the fact that the only animal stories (in Ashton) are retellings of Aesop's fables.) Although children's literature did not yet exist per se, it is notable that a certain group of animals stories, Aesop's fables, was considered "the only book ... fit for children" because it wedded didacticism with entertainment (Locke; cited in Hunt 13). Whereas these early animal stories were unapologetically didactic, Potter and London are still "educating" readers, if more pleasantly. Rather than inculcating explicit morals, however, these early twentieth-century texts educate us as readers about the unstable but necessary notion of differentiation ? along national, generic, and psychological lines. Given the unceasing popularity of these fables (Aesop seems to have been continuously in print in English since 1484), it is all the more striking that animal stories were not produced in significant numbers until the end of the eighteenth century (Darton 9; Blount 36-40; Hunt 13-16). Animals appear seldom in Reformation-era literature, and then only as straw dogs (or rather, straw St.-George-and-the-dragons) for anti-Catholic propaganda. John Bunyan's Divine Emblems, or Temporal Things Spiritualized (1686) is representative of the few seventeenth-century animal texts in using animal characters purely as moral patterns (Darton 63-64). The influence of natural history is evident in wholly descriptive animal stories like Thomas Boreman's Gigantick Histories series (1740-1743), which included the Description of Three Hundred Animals (seventh ed., 1753). But the first real outpouring of animal stories (stories increasingly committed to entertainment) came at the close of the eighteenth century with works like Dorothy Kilmer's Life and Perambulations of a Mouse (1783), Sarah Trimmer's The History of the Robins (1786) and the anonymous Death and Burial of Cock Robin (1795). (A more extensive list can be found in Hunt, 72-76.) The production of animal stories did not seem to flag in the nineteenth century, continuing well through the publication of Charles Kingsley's The Water-Babies (1863) and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Even if the industry did wane, its decline was nothing compared to the dearth of new</page><page sequence="47">108 Victorian Review animal stories between 1484 and the late 1700s. The contrast is heightened if we consider that Aesop's fables were basically the only Western animal stories extant; one might argue, then, animal stories had not been produced in significant numbers since Aesop in the sixth century. This paper does not attempt to explain why animal stories suddenly became more interesting after more man two thousand years. My project is to examine one small stage in the resurgence of the animal story. 12. This gap is not as much noted by these authors as it can be observed from the evidence they present. For histories, see Hunt and Darton. As an anthology, the volume edited by Johnson and Scott (1935) is even more interesting as a contemporary of Seton's Famous Animal Stories (1932, rpt. 1935). 13. Peter Rabbit dates even earlier in Seton's periodization if we take into account that Potter's first draft of the tale was an illustrated letter to Noel Moon, dated September 4, 1893 (Letters 20-27). 14. I remain unconvinced by other Potter readers and critics that gender is relevant in this case, that is, in the particular stage of self-differentiation (psychotopography) common to both Potter and James. It seems facile merely to say that of course gender is relevant (that is, perforce) and even less convincing to say that gender is relevant because the rabbits are gendered. True, Peter is differentiated from his sisters on the basis of gender. And gender might read as an inscription of other privileges (in this case, the privilege to escape the domestic, the privilege to trespass), were it not for the fact that, in The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies (the third story in the Peter Rabbit cycle) all of the Flopsy Bunnies trespass on McGregor's land, male and female. One might still make the argument that gender makes a difference out of the fact that the trespassing Flopsy Bunnies are not differentiated by sex. The argument would be either that all of the rabbits are male (an unsafe assumption) or, more penetratingly, that because the bunnies have not yet been differentiated as male or female, what will become two differentially privileged sexes are able here to enjoy the same freedom. But this position does not seem viable in the long run, because it fails to take into account the fact that the Flopsy Bunnies* parents, Benjamin and Flopsy ? rabbits differentiated by gender ? trespass also. It is an observation worth making mat the notion of self-differentiation (in all the texts examined here, though most obviously in James) can be seen as a way of avoiding distinctions like gender, class, and race ? axes of affiliation unsettling to a late Victorian like James and perhaps still unsettled for Potter, London, and Seton. 15. It is possible to view this reading as ignoring the pressing issue of gender in these texts. Peter is male, as are Wully and Buck. But if Call of the Wild is a very male (that is, a rite of passage) narrative, then White Fang features a she wolf as strong and brutal as Buck comes to be. That she-wolf seeks mates and breeds, and so can be rejected as only further evidence of the masculinist underpinnings of London's work. Potter, as already mentioned, has been read as struggling from within a socially prescribed gender role. Such observations</page><page sequence="48">W.C. HARRIS 109 seem entirely valid to me, but they also seem to halt critical work at a certain point and prevent us from noticing ways in which these authors (male and female), despite their biases or dispositions, managed to engage with a common issue. I do not see it as irresponsible criticism not to centralize, for example, the fact that Seton's cowboys are all men. The point of these texts seems to be an engagement with, an excavation of a space in which gender is not a significant factor, where it does not make a difference. The point would be that many other things do make a difference: things like psychic practices. If it is a weakness that self-differentiation is not seen as gendered, then that is a weakness of the texts ? a sign of their desire to avoid (or feeling required to avoid) these very real differences. And self-differentiation obviously has to jump through gender hurdles. The Jamesian "re-instatement of the vague" may be a reproachable attempt to elide the differential of gender (I: 254). But it may also be a discussion of psychic life beyond, across ? perhaps, before ? gender, an examination of the processes common to both sexes, however modified they may be by the gender position of those subjects. This debate is not likely to be settled soon. But it seems just as useful to talk about the way these texts theoritize the differentiations selves make in common, as about the way such theoritization obscures the marks (like gender, class, and race) by which institutions of the day made differences and made those differences matter (in terms of which selves were recognized). Characterizing these texts* models of differentiation as Utopian or dystopian seems less productive, or at least a move of secondary importance to figuring out the nature of those models on the site of their production. In other words, not enough has been constructively said about the impact of discussing (human) self differentiation in animal stories. 16. On all fours it is hard to differentiate Peter from any other rabbit. Clothes represent an identity Peter is not ready for. Clothes hinder him. Having shed his clogs, his remaining clothing (a jacket) trips him up. The significance of this sartorial hindrance is highlighted by the intrusion of the narrator: "After losing [his shoes], he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket" (15). 17. Like the Jamesian mind and body, Peter and the door "stand face to face in a common world .... Some sort of signal must be given by the thing to the mind's brain, or the knowing will not occur ? we find as a matter of fact that the mere existence of a thing outside the brain is not a sufficient cause for our knowing it: it must strike the brain in some way, as well as be there to be known. But the brain being struck, the knowledge is constituted by a new construction that occurs altogether in the mind'* (I: 218-19). 18. Certainly, Peter's theft differentiates him from his siblings who pick berries in the woods where they are free, as well as from his mother who buys bread at the baker's. The fact that the woods are both precapitalist (berries you may pick) and capitalist (bread you must buy) blurs any clear line between animal</page><page sequence="49">110 Victorian Review and human, nature and civilization. But such inflections of the "well marked" are not important to Potter's text. Indeed, one might say that such distinctions are uninteresting, if not invisible, in a text that subordinates all distinctions to one: the differentiation of the self through and by a visceral opposition to all that is not the self. Potter's understanding of self seems quite Jamesian in that all that is not the self is all that is outside the body. 19. Ruth MacDonald speaks for many who might object to my argument (that clothes fail to differentiate Peter where psychotopography succeeds) when she cites the preoccupation in The Tale of Benjamin Bunny with retrieving Peter's clothes. MacDonald speaks of clothes as humanizing ? which focuses on nature/civilization paradigms that tend to overpower Peter Rabbit and that, as paradigms, do not need this text's additional support. For MacDonald, Peter's return to the garden for his domes "makes the point about [his] need for his clothes [in order] to be a whole rabbit and not just an unthinking creature" (27). As I have shown, the garden door scene controverts such a reading: it is through the sensation of his unclothed body against territorial boundaries that Peter gains a sense of self (as a differentiated entity) for the first time. Another telling piece of evidence that trespass (and not clothing) differentiates is the episode of the red handkerchief. Benjamin and Peter retrieve the latter's clothes "in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief presently worn by Peter; and "us [ing] the [Jhandkerchief ' means specifically "fillfing] it] . . . with onions, as a little present for [Benjamin's] aunt" (59, 60). Benjamin calls the onions "a present," but they are still McGregor's onions. He and Peter are still stealing, that is, trespassing the boundaries between property and selves: neither rabbit seems to be consciously stealing, but rather each acts as if the onions are his, as if no one (no McGregor, certainly) exists outside himself. 20. An earlier description of "consciousness" as "the stream of thought ... or of subjective life" (I: 224), and a fuller account of this model, is available in the chapter entitled "The Stream of Thought" (I: 224-90). 21. As in Peter Rabbit's case, Buck's new environment may not so much strip him of differentiation as reveal how undifferentiated he is to begin with: "Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his" (6). 22. With the Indian massacre of Buck's master, Hal's beating of Buck, and Buck's own fight for leadership amongst the wolves, London ironizes any assumptions we might have about the "well-marked" boundary that distinguishes savage from civilized, and animal from man. 23. Almost as soon as Darwin posited his theory of evolution, his followers split into two general camps. Some emphasized the progressive nature of adaptation and the consequent promise for human development (see Alfred Russel Wallace's Darwinism (1889) and William Winwood Reade's The Martyrdom of Man [1872]). Others focused on the other possible direction of adaptation ? regression ? an aspect Darwin expressed hedgingly. If man had evolved, could he not devolve as well? Degeneration usually carried a</page><page sequence="50">W.C. HARRIS 111 moral charge of laxity against (at that time, Victorian) society. For more and less explicitly moral examples, see, respectively, Ray Lankester's Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism (1880) and Henry Drummond's Natural Law in the Spiritual World (1883). More detailed accounts of both progressive and regressive evolution exist in Chapters Three and Four of Peter Morton's The Vital Science. 24. I avoid the term Social Darwinism in favor of Darwinism not only because the first is so hard to define but also because it is not necessary to go beyond Darwin for the notion of reversion. Robert Bannister makes an eloquent case that Social Darwinism was most powerfully a "myth" a charge leveled "against laissez-faire and utilitarians" (10). "Reform Darwinism" by contrast was the much more substantial school of thought, which had more substantial existence in progressive reform after World War I (11). Bannister is responding in part to those like Richard Hofstadter who take Social Darwinism to be a real force in social and political thought and action (at least in America). For more on the debate about the "reality" of Social Darwinism, see Bannister 3-13. For an account of the so-called Social Darwinists themselves, see Hofstadter (51-104) and Bannister (97-136). 25. For examples of this approach besides Labor's, see Mary Allen (78-80), Anthony Naso (17-21, 29), and Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin (56-59) ? all of whom read "instinct" biologically (and I would argue, literally) as "inherited [that is, inherent] mental characteristics" (Naso 19). 26. Like Auerbach, I wish to "revise" or at least restrain reading texts like Call as "grounded in deterministic laws of environment and biology" (52). Auerbach focuses on works of literary naturalism and their engagement with notions of me materiality and the labor of writing. Given his focus, Auerbach reads Buck's "disciplined education" as regarding the delivery of letters and mirroring London's own worries about the relationship of a socialist author to a capitalist market (61). Regardless of the trajectory of Auerbach*s argument, I wish to borrow the force of his comment about the active, engaged quality of Buck's "education." Works Cited Allen, Mary.
