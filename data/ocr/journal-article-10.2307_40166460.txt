<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium JAMES T.CHIAMPI No poet was ever more daring in his final simile, in so long a poem, daring to bring into this very end the notion and image ("cold," as in geometry or mathematics!) of the geometer who studies the circle in the vain attempt to square it. "First readers" of the poem, students generally, are of course amazed at the simile, in its strong suggestion of calm, cool study of the greatest mystery of the Christian faith, the Incarnation. But so it is! And the amazement of the modern reader must arise from the abstractness, the geometrical nature, of the vision of God that terminates so long a journey. The poet's conception is Byzantine in nature and as far from the anthropomorphic as can be - except for the final scrutiny of "our effigy" in the second person, which is perhaps a corrective of the geometrical and abstract.1 keeping with his practice, Charles Singleton's commentary on verses 133-135 of Paradiso XXXIII offers an esthetic response its historical context.2 I would like to expand on his observation by offering a reading of the Paradiso that orients that response in the traditions and concerns of Christian rationalism. To that end, I shall extend Singjeton s notion of "coldness" backward in the canticle and relate it to Christian deiftcatio in order to show that this imagery climaxes a process of freeing the implied reader from a misplaced trust in the power of unaided intellect, and setting him/her in a beneficent "region of unlikeness."3 That makes the Paradiso's transaction with the reader in large part an exercitatio animi, Augustine's term for the exercise of the mind that leads it from the material to the intelligible, from alienation home. But Dante's particular exercitatio in the Paradiso differs from those in the preceding canticles.4 Here the food he offers is a "cibo rigido" 255</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 (Par. V, 38), one suitable to a more spiritually mature reader.5 Dante will accordingly take what of vision the artes liberates provide and then surpass and annul them, using them as signs of a higher existence which they are unable to grasp. According to the "Letter to Can Grande della Scala," if we attend to the moral sense of the Paradiso, "the conversion of the soul from the sorrow and misery of sin to a state of grace is signified."6 The rationalist tradition knew that the first step to happiness required that the soul be weaned from the saeculum. But that is the problem: the poem itself is an artifact that belongs to the saeculum. Dante's conclusion is his poetic strategy: to use poetry to teach the proper use of poetry. Dante begins by establishing the legitimacy of his leadership on grace. He accordingly alludes to a gratia gratis data (in the language of Summa theologiae [la.2ae.lll, 1]), a non-sanctifying grace given him so that he might "cooperate in the justification of someone else."7 Bear in mind that "grace is ordained to the bringing back of man to God" (p. 127). In addition, the Poet's addresses to the reader together with the speeches of the blessed display what Thomas calls (in ST la.2ae.lll, 4) the freely bestowed graces of "utterance of knowledge" and "utterance of wis- dom" (p. 137). As Thomas puts it (ST la.2ae.lll, 4): "Freely bestowed grace includes all that man needs to instruct someone in divine matters, which are above reason" (p. 137). Grace underwrites Dante's wisdom in both its apostolic and doctrinal moments. God has moved Dante's free choice to prepare him for grace; Dante would aid his reader's preparation and to that end tells the reader why to trust him. The exerdtatio that the Poet would direct is, in part, a graced lesson in passing from the density of literary discourse to ideal entities. Singleton's "coldness" marks the difference between a question of literary pleasure and an act of the rational will. "Coldness" both portrays and aids the act of man's giving himself back to himself, in the words of Augustine's The Magnitude of the Soul* Accordingly, the best way for the reader to taste the meal that nourished the Pilgrim's wings for flight is by undertaking the exerdtatio anitni the Poet elaborates. Such a meal will awaken a desire for righteous desiring in him/her - that is to say, inculcate temperance, fortitude, prudence and justice as its first moment - and then proceed to arouse yearnings for the grace of faith, hope and charity. Happiness is the reward for Dante's charitable activity: first, happiness in what of God he can remember, then the happiness he experiences as his sacrificial writing helps him die to the world, and finally the promise of an ultimate 256</page><page sequence="3">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI return to happiness (perfect self-sufficient existence, i.e., God) after death. Given its ambition, the exerdtatio of the Paradiso must be alert not only to the dangers of artistic vainglory, it must be alert to the dangers posed by a prideful, unguided intellectualism - an intellectualism igno- rant or contemptuous of grace - as alert as are Augustine's exerdtationes in the The Trinity and Confessions. As we shall see, Dante's invocation of grace reveals his humility, underscoring his legitimacy as our guide and making him, like Beatrice, an anti-Ulysses.9 Let me sketch out the rationalist tradition Dante inherits. Plato understood the role of what Augustine would call the artes liberates (the rational disciplines) as first directing the mind of his future ruler beyond the world of time into a world independent of it, a world of truly real entities, and then toward pure goodness, perhaps the form of forms. To the question: Is the preceding punctuation a point? The intellectual would answer no, because the printed period has the measurable dimensions of height, width and depth. And he would add that pure location is certainly no property of mundane things, nor can its existence be derived from them. The ideal point exists and exists independently of its representation. To the question: Where is the number one? the intellectual responds that a perfectly simple unit is not its representation, no matter how many single objects he points to to illustrate it. Thus via geometry and arithmetic - as opposed to logistic, simple calculation - Plato's ontology led his guardian to glimpse a world be- yond this one, beyond change: a world of unshakable certitude. In the Republic, Plato showed that there was a higher realm, one wherein resided the quality of existence itself upon which even these ideas depended, the idea of the good. Contemplating the good would make the polis better; it would channel energies beyond a yearning for goods and the conflict it breeds to the good, beyond time, thus achieving the harmony that was the natural, rational state of society.10 Despite its benevolence, such paideia was not sufficient for the Christian. For an Augustine, God was not the good that unaided reason could attain to, but the God of Revelation, so Platonic ontology was of limited use; to ontology Augustine favored natural theology which the proud Platonist dismissed as superfluous. But then the Platonist did not even know that man had been wounded by sin. Looking upward for the Christian meant looking past the ideas to his reward in the perfection of his being: eternal life, the resurrection of the body, the satisfaction of will and intellect by 257</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 union with their objects, all things for which man naturally yearns. For this, divine aid in the form of grace - both natural and supernatural - was necessary. More to the point: Augustine's Creator was not the form of forms, but the Father who beckons to his prodigal son to return; and anti-intellectual/anti-pantheist humility was man's first step homeward. This return required the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, which were themselves gifts of grace. They alone permit mankind to pass beyond the grasp of line to the Cross, beyond number to the Trinity. As Dante's journey attests, they raise us beyond even the world of ideal entities Plato revealed.11 Finally, the Platonist lacked a systematic notion of the will, so Platonism could hardly lead one to the perfect happiness for which he/she naturally yearned; contemplation, after all, is a pale thing when compared with rapturous possession.12 The Dante of the Divine Comedy possessed an Augustinian awareness of the inadequacies of such intellectualism: the Poet affirms his fidelity to Augustine when, before the final vision, he demonstrates his humility, rejoicing and confessing: "Oh abbondante grazia ond'io presunsi / ficcar lo viso per la luce etterna, / tanto che la veduta vi consunsi!" (Par. XXXIII, 82- 84).13 In the first book of On Christian Doctrine, Augustine charac- terized the Father as Unity, the Son as Equality and the Holy Spirit as Unity plus Equality.14 Since according to the letter of Dante's poem the Poet has experienced this place, which is Wisdom itself, even ideal unity taken alone could not be a terminal value for him, because he knew that unity itself was simply another sign of God. The task of Christian understanding was not to grasp the disciplines of Plato's Guardians, but the scandal and stumbling block of the mysteria. And contemplation had to yield its primacy to union. To illustrate: in the early Soliloquies, Augustine answered the question posed by Reason ("Whether it would be enough for you to know God as you know this geometric sphere, that is, to have no doubt about God as you have none about it") thus, It seems to me that not only the objects, but the knowledge itself is different. First, because a line and a sphere are not so different but that the knowledge of both is contained in one branch of learning; no geometer, however, has claimed that he teaches a knowledge of God. Secondly, if the knowledge of God and of these things were the same, I would rejoice over knowing them as much as I anticipate my joy in the knowledge of God.15 258</page><page sequence="5">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI The knowledge offered by Revelation and the Church transcends that offered by geometry, however much geometry's immutable laws might help the intellect conceive immutability, because instructed by Revela- tion we might come to possess God in ecstasy. Moreover, even the contemplative grasp of ideal entities leaves the soul far from God; such a grasp may yield truths, but not the Truth. Augustine accordingly believes that once he comes to know God, geometry and "all these things will vanish from my consideration" (p. 358) if only because greater than knowing the contents of the mind of God is participation in that mind itself. Once it has served its purpose, Dante will reduce geometry to the ancillary status of analogy or adornment throughout the Paradiso. Like Augustine, Dante is aware that the liberal arts awaken desires whose satisfaction requires that the liberal arts be surpassed. The immu- table laws of geometry, for example, bespeak an ordered world only an immutable, omnipotent, omniscient God could create, and only a mind in some way eternal could comprehend, because only like knows like. It is thus easy for the geometer to become smug in his knowledge, forgetting both that his science is not an end in itself, and that it is not wisdom itself. After all, what does geometry know of peace? Indeed, Augustine's words in the first book of On Christian Doctrine form the basis of Dante's concern:16 For if we find complete enjoyment in ourselves we remain on the road and place our hopes of blessedness in a man or in an angel. Thus the proud man or the proud angel places his enjoyment in himself and rejoices that others place their hopes in him also. But the holy man and the holy angel refresh us with what they have received, and only with what they have received, either for themselves or for us, and even though we are wearied and desire to rest and to remain with them, they urge us onward when we have been refreshed toward Him in whose enjoyment we may both be blessed, (p. 28) Dante's Augustinian scrupulousness leads him at every step to conjure away the specter of pride, whether by invoking Marsyas, the Pies, and Icarus; by the speech of an Oderisi against vainglory, or Beatrice's excoriation of the vain inanities of preachers. Dante accordingly makes the version of the Lord's Prayer that the penitents of pride recite humbly assert man's radical dependence on grace: " Venga ver' noi la pace del tuo regno, / che noi ad essa non potem da noi, / s'ella non vien, con tutto 259</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 nostro ingegno" (Purg. XI, 7-9); that pace is happiness. Here Dante describes the moment when piety - a form of docta ignorantia - surpasses the artes liberates, since the righteousness piety inculcates provides even the ignorant among the devout a sure route to the invisibilia: After all, pieta and giustizia lighten man/ woman for flight (Purg. XI, 37) to a most pious and just empire (Par. XXXII, 117). Dante closes the frame that the Lord's Prayer opened with St. Bernard's prayer to the Virgin, which also abjures presumption: "qual vuol grazia e a te non ricorre, / sua disi'anza vuol volar sanz' ali" (Par. XXXIII, 14-15).17 No Icarus Dante; he knows that no preceding merit on his part has forced divinity to single him out. Beatrice thus urges Dante to humble thanksgiving for God's gifts of habitual or supernatural grace: '"Ringrazia, / ringrazia il Sol de li angeli, ch'a questo / sensibil t'ha levato per sua grazia'" (Par. X, 52-54). He thanks the sun of the angels, after all, not the sun of the philosophers. The Poet's concern is with a voyage of the person to the Empyrean. The role of the artes is largely epitaphic. In a narrative of the "passing of the sanctified soul from the bondage of the corruption of this world to the liberty of glory" (p. 199) geometry's function is largely heuristic, serving as a means to the understanding of ideal personhood, because for Dante the greatness of the human person stands just beneath that of the angels in the hierarchy of creation. Ideal personhood, whether grasped through Christ as embodying the reformation of the imago Dei, through descriptions of the resurrected person, or through the incom- parable life of Mary, is the Poet's end. But this thematics gives rise to a series of disorienting questions that make the familiarity of the self - and implicitly memory - problematic: Can we be at once Christlike and like the geometrical point while remaining ourselves? How can personhood be both ours yet incomparably superior? both ours and not ours? Reason offers a partial answer: we are like the point because the Eternal Law, Wisdom, has made physical law in its own image, joining soul to cosmos by determining soul to rise to the immaterial "place" most appropriate for it. Heaven itself could, from one perspective, be viewed as reward as proper place. These concerns come together in the scandal represented by the presence of mere infants in the Heavenly Rose and the ironic presence of unbaptized infants in Limbo among Plato, Aris- totle and the pagan sages. Viewed sub specie aeternitatis, both learning and august pagan wisdom are as nothing. But then the blessed themselves are as children, for pace the intellectuals: "Unless you be converted, and 260</page><page sequence="7">Dante's Paradiso /rom Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:3).18 Dante introduces these polemical themes from Christian rationalism as if by adumbration in the fifth canto of the Inferno when Francesca confesses: "solo un punto fu quel che ci vinse" {Inf. V, 132). That punto is normally and correctly translated as "passage," but it looks forward to the punto around which the blessed will dance, which is God.19 Two crucial verses cap that movement: in Paradiso XXIX, where the Pilgrim is described as "fiso nel punto che m'avea vinto" (v. 9) - the punto, once again, indicating God; and in Paradiso XXX, where the Poet describes the circulation of the blessed "sempre dintorno al punto che mi vinse" (v. 1 1). The afterlife of Francesca's words suggests that rational knowl- edge, as exemplified by geometry, is superior to the knowledge proffered by a carnal literature, which can be misread. This is the first step of Dante s exercitatio. The otherness of the geometrical point is actually the future of reformed imago Dei, as exemplified by the adoring movement of the Seraphim and Cherubim in the crystalline heaven, who yearn to be like the point: "Cosi veloci seguono i suoi vimi, / per somigliarsi al punto quanto ponno; / e posson quanto a veder son soblimi" (Par. XXVIII, 100-102). The angels are rushing not to resemble a mark, but an ideal/spiritual entity. Resemblance then is nothing we can imagine - we require the graces of intellectual vision. Dante ex- presses what to our normal, quotidian view - and to our schooling in literary convention - can only appear as both a scandal and a stumbling block: true human home, our natural place in creation (if our elective love does not swerve toward sin), is more like a geometrical entity than, say, a palace. But there are precedents for this thought: if according to Augustine of The Magnitude of the Soul, mind should ideally pass from the grasp of circle to that of its inextended center point (p. 85), so in Paradise the circling souls pursue greater union with the point as does the Pilgrim. The point in Paradise, moreover, has a power denied the geometrical point, that of orienting us in our world, since although it appears enclosed by the universe, it will reveal itself as enclosing - and circumscribing - every- thing (Par. XXX, 12). Dante's point is wisdom. Describing the Heaven of Jupiter, the Poet will compare his circling movement to that of moral improvement: 261</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 E come, per sentir piu dilettanza bene operando, 1'uom di giorno in giorno s'accorge che la sua virtute avanza, si m'accors' io che '1 mio girare intorno col cielo insieme avea cresciuto l'arco, veggendo quel miracol piu addorno. (Par. XVIII, 58-63) In The Magnitude of The Soul, Augustine claimed: But, surely you see that a circle is more like virtue than any other plane figure. For that reason we are wont to give high praise to the line of Horace in which he says, "His strength is in himself; all smooth and and round, his ego is a little world" - and with good reason. For, you will not find in the endowments of the soul anything that is more harmonious with itself in every way than virtue; nor in plane figures anything more symmetrical than a circle, (p. 89) The circle represents self-sufficiency, which is common to ideal geomet- rical entities - in their transcendence of their rendering - to the happy soul - free of the world - and to art as well. The happy intellective soul knows the ideal circle as part of its familiar surroundings, of its ecology so to speak; in Heaven, the intellective soul is in its proper place. But such a state and place is unfamiliar to the carnal; reason, after all, is not passed with the seed, but is infused directly by God (Purg. XXV, 70-75). Home is decidedly unheimlich to carnal man; faith is necessary because it assures him/her that such a state can become truly familiar. But this, of course, is precisely the role of art. In a similar fashion, the blessed seem forbidding to us, as when Beatrice and Cato brusquely dismiss Virgil's words. Of course, when high creatures stare into order, which is the form that makes the universe like God (Par, I, 103-105), they do so with a vision whose economy disdains poetic and rhetorical topoi. Their style suits well Dante's paideia, for the language of romance is less appropriate to self-knowledge than cooler scientific language which links soul to the apparently impersonal movement of the stars. Scientific language supplants the language of the love tradition as a fashioner of self-understanding, mutely humbling poetry's urge to recreate the world in its image. The circling of the blessed, who yearn after the punto, possesses a figural dimension insofar as it repudiates both the static circles of hell and the carnal, commonsensical vision of the damned. The blessed state 262</page><page sequence="9">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI held and holds little attraction for the damned. Thus it could be said that the circling performs the alienating task of Dante's rhetoric. Moreover, for Dante, as for Augustine, even cool, neo-Platonic contemplation provides only the food of children, although it provides an important step to those for whom grace has not reserved the experience of heaven. Dante's figuration of God as a point serves as an antidote to the vice Augustine, following Paul, called "the lust of the eyes," a form of carnal concupiscence, which he described in Of True Religion: If he does not hold fast to the whole discipline of divine providence but imagines he does, and tries to resist the flesh, he merely reaches the images of visible things. He vainly excogitates vast spaces of light exactly like ordinary light which he sees has fixed limits here, and promises himself a future habitation there. He does not know that he is still entangled in the lust of the eye, and that he is carrying this world with him in his endeavor to go beyond it. He thinks he has reached another world simply by falsely imagining the bright part of this world infinitely extended, (p. 36) Dante's verbal strategies suggest that a true grasp of the point protects the soul from the sort of idolatrous and pantheistic imaginings, wherein one counterfeits Heaven with the base alloys of sense. It is not fortuitous that Dante will describe to Cacciaguida his freedom from Fortune - which Augustine and Boethius would say governs all those things which can be taken from us - using geometrical language: to be free, i.e., happy, is to be "ben tetragono ai colpi di ventura" (Par. XVII, 24). As early as the first canto of the Paradiso, a broader, more spiritual, notion of the self begins to emerge "quando la rota che tu sempiterni / desiderato, a se mi fece atteso / con l'armonia che temperi e discerni. . ." (Par. I, 76-78). The sun itself is now ancillary and semiotic. If Platonic harmony revealed a world of ideal entities, here, in the sphere of fire, celestial harmony directs the Pilgrim beyond itself to the origins of creation: "La novita del suono e '1 grande lume / di lor cagion m'accesero un disio / mai non sentito di cotanto acume" (Par. 1,82-84). For this reason, the Pilgrim no longer enjoys the marvels of nature for their own sake. The harmony, novelty and brightness described in these verses attract the Pilgrim s attention only to distract it toward a yearning for the knowledge of causes. This harmony is more than an occasion for Platonic contemplation or belletristic indulgence, it is a prayerful yearn- 263</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, ex, 1992 ing for God. Moreover, this image of the heavenly spheres as a wheel ("rota") looks ahead to the final image, the interior wheel that is evenly moved by 'Tamor che move il sole e l'altre stelle" (Par. XXXIII, 145), as if to underscore the notion that the perfection of the Pilgrim's will and intellect is the achievement of his proper place in nature. Defying romance conventions, Dante renders the rising sun as a geometrical exercise: Surge ai mortali per diverse foci la lucerna del mondo; ma da quella che quattro cerchi giugne con tre croci, con miglior corso e con migliore Stella esce congiunta, e la mondana cera piu a suo modo tempera e suggella. (Par. 1, 37-42) As we gaze backward from here, it is as though the Purgatorio's often belletristic astronomical descriptions, such as "dolce color d'oriental zaffiro" (1, 13) and the white and vermiglion cheeks of beautiful Aurora (II, 7-8), were meant to set us up for the shock of encountering the geometrical, cooler, more austere astronomy of the Paradise These early verses describing the sun - the fundamental intellectual image - an- nounce a Christian rationalist end: reformation as the recovery of the soul's harmony with nature. After all, a "lucerna" is a tool that serves man. The act whereby the sun imprints the "mondana cera" suggests the way the Sun of Truth, via the reformation imago Dei, shapes "umana cera." To be close to God is, in essence, to return to form. Unlike an intellectual exercise in geometry and astronomy, this sun promises more than a mere disengagement of the mind from time, because three crosses inevitably recall to the Christian mind the historical events of Calvary, just as circle upon circle - in the completed rainbow of the Resurrection - will speak of the inner life of the triune God to which Calvary promised man participation (Par. XII, 10-18; Par. XXXIII, 115-120). Viewed retrospectively from the final vision, it is as though an astronomical image were made to say that via the Cross we enter the rainbow. All this, of course, is contingent on man's self-shaping with the aid of grace. Perhaps most important is the movement itself whereby an apprecia- tion of heavenly beauty yields to an astronomy that speaks of the mysteries that structure the rationality of the universe. That displacement 264</page><page sequence="11">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI shows that creation is ordinatus in the highest degree, but not as a non-Christian intellectual would have it. And since the harmony of the person is one with - even as it enhances - the harmony of all creation, one can glimpse mortal perfection in the order the sun observes, just as the Poet does in the angels' circling about the point. The universe speaks of human destiny and vice versa. The strong suggestion of a figural dimension in these verses helps us grasp the vision of order in the mind of God (Par. I, 103-105) by revealing the personal divinity at work behind an apparently impersonal nature. This theme was announced in the Francesca episode's play about the punto which, while literary, looked ahead to the geometrical. The geometrical point, in turn, also looks ahead to its annulment in the squaring of the circle (Par. XXXIII, 132-136), that is, in an analogy for mysterium. Thus does punto ("point") become punto, past participle ofpungere ("to pierce"), in order to render the penetration of Christ's body which healed the wound Eve opened in mankind; thus St. Bernard in the Empyrean: "La piaga che Maria richiuse e unse, / quella ch'e tanto bella da' suoi piedi / e colei che l'aperse e che la punse" (Par. XXXII, 4-6). Natural love - our inborn yearning for happiness - is our kinship with the movements of both small and great natural bodies. Elective - personal - love, in its freedom of desiring, may depart from the proper course, and find itself at odds with this "impeto primo" (Par. 1, 134). When it does, sin sets the human creature at odds with a rational physics, which directs all things according to their natures to their proper ends. Restoration of order is restoration of harmonious natural relations: "La concreata e perpetiia sete / del dei'forme regno cen portava / veloci quasi come '1 ciel vedete" (Par. II, 19-21). Admiring harmony in the limited sense as an intellectual would is as nothing compared with increasing it. Dante's writing works to this end, since it is the activity by which a poet who writes "in pro del mondo che mal vive" (Purg. XXXII, 103) harmoniously informs his own spiritual trajectory, reforms himself and ascends to become an adornment of the heavens. When one who has seen God and lived describes his flight, his description is necessarily a rational activity, for by urging others to such movement, he promotes order and becomes the willing agent of Providence. Thus does the poem respond to neo-Platonic distrust of poetry's effects. The Poet has estab- lished his place with the aid of grace and leads others there as well. Reason must guide Dante's poetic choices in order that reading become 265</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 flight homeward for the fledgling, pursuing reader. Only thus can the Poet earn his name, Dante Alighieri, "Wing-Bearing Giver." In Paradiso II (w. 37- 39), the Poet describes his entry into the first star, which was as solid as diamond or pearl, and continues, saying that if he were in fact in the body, "accender ne dovria piu il disio / di veder quella essenza in che si vede / come nostra natura e Dio s'unio" (w. 40-42). The miracle of his graced completion of natural law, he believes, should spur our desire to understand another mysterium, the Incarnation. The Poet is teaching us how to respond to the miraculous; one index of the fatal limitation on the spiritual vision of the damned was their differing inability to recognize and understand the miraculous nature of the Pilgrims journey through hell, and the grace that enabled it. Surprise at his presence is both rare and obtuse. Let two examples suffice: Francesca's greeting the Pilgrim as you who "visitando vai" {Inf. V, 89), and Cavalcante's false - and proud - assumption that the Pilgrim journeyed "per altezza d'ingegno" {Inf. X, 59). The grace that makes such a journey possible, that chooses such an unworthy man as Dante ("me degno a cio ne io ne altri '1 crede," Inf. II, 33) over others, would have scandalized the intellectual, especially such a one as the magistrate and heretic, Pelagius, who demanded that God give man what Pelagius knew he deserved. When reason studies creation, its love for God should increase, but in order truly to know, it must realize that nature's orderliness is a vestigium to be penetrated and surpassed, because beyond it lie the mysteria. Dante must likewise surpass his carnal self-understanding by grasping himself as imago Dei; that is, humbly as signum, not as res. The blessed rejoice in the mysterious "inequities" of grace just as they do in the impersonality of spiritual physics, as we see in the case of Constance, who describes herself as having born to the second wind of Swabia its third and final power {Par. Ill, 1 18- 120). The humility implicit in her self-description would be unthinkable to the individualist Fari- nata, or his child-obsessed companion, Cavalcante. Wind is meteorologi- cal; indeed in Purgatorio XI (w. 100-102), it symbolizes the transient. Constance s humility abounds in Heaven: although damned Francesca performed her wish to be conformed to her misprisions of the Lancelot, in Heaven Piccarda performs her conformity to the order established by the Holy Spirit, an order expressed in reason {Par. Ill, 52-54). Piccarda conforms herself not to the visible and imagistic, but to the invisible, and by virtue of her existence in the Word, to the divine act of reading {Par. 266</page><page sequence="13">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI X, 1-6). Francesca fashioned herself in romance; Piccarda is fashioned as a creature rewritten to conformity to the Word as it is read in love by the Father, and as the Word reads Him. "E 'n la sua volontade e nostra pace" (Par. Ill, 85): her submissive freedom makes her like the psaltery of ten strings in the Psalms, responsive to the hand of God. As numbers and circles offer a glimpse at the immutable, so do perfected human beings whose natural place is where numbers and circles have their origin. Their immutable will is an ethical kinship with circularity. Dante passes to incarnational imagery: Scripture condescends to man's capacity and attributes hands and feet to God having other meaning (Par. IV, 43-45). It is as though Dante had constructed an analogy between the ability to grasp circularity in relation to this particular circle and the ability to understand perfected humanity in relation to one's humanity here and now. The Poet alludes to the survival of the personality in a timeless, disincarnate state when the Pilgrim fails to recognize Piccarda, whom he knew in life (Par. IV, 58-62). This unrecognizability of familiar faces enacts the fate of the self in Heaven, when the soul has become foreign to itself. When the Poet shows his indifference to the Pilgrim he was by interrupting his narrative, we realize that the encounter with Piccarda was prophetic. Poet will be to Pilgrim as the nov us homo to the vetus homo of Paul, or as brusque Beatrice was to courtly Virgil. Now, as he travels upward, the light which greater love procures is the means to a transformation of the self which delights and surprises the self, leading to yet greater dwelling in new- ness - greater unfamiliarity - and greater change. Dante is moving to- ward his own perfection as reformed individual within a perfected humanity, and becoming strange to himself, as strange to himself as the souls he knew are unfamiliar to him. All this movement is an ongoing holocaust of the familiar. And finally, the man who once felt pity for Francesca will claim: "Bene e che sanza termine si doglia / chi, per amor di cosa che non duri / etternalmente, quello amor si spoglia" (Par. XV, 10-12). What a "hard saying" these too rarely cited verses have been for Dante criticism. Their rejection by estheticist criticism shows the degree to which it failed its own criterion of novelty.20 The Pilgrim must learn to dwell in newness of mind. When a radiance of pure joy (Par. V, 6) hides Beatrice from the Pilgrim, we realize that the Pilgrim must grow happier and freer (in the sense of indifferent to mundane things) in order to see her clearly. The Pilgrim's vision must be 267</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 conformed to its object, in this case, a perfected humanity. Peter Damian burns with an illumination that comes directly from the Supreme Essence: "Quinci vien l'allegrezza ond'io fiammeggio; / per ch'a la vista mia, quant' ella e chiara, / la chiarita de la fiamma pareggio" (Par. XXI, 88-90) . The same joy Peter Damian feels, the Holy Spirit, will eventually help the Pilgrim perform a holocaust of his free will, since that joy draws him nearer to an unlimited good before which there can be no free choice.21 As Trajan learned, it is wise to accept the counsel of one who is better; the drama of the Paradiso is based on the premise that the counsel of one whose will is perfect is more salutary than an under- standing of geometry. Plato knew nothing of salvation, and Augustine made no journey to heaven. Dante knows that the speech of those who have survived death is more cogent. Of course, the Pilgrim's grasp of the nature of free will as God's greatest gift was aided by the revelation of the independent worlds arithmetic and geometry reveal. Nevertheless, the Pilgrim is moving toward perfect fixity of the will in God, perfect self-forgetfulness, a state imaged in the vow whereby free choice is annihilated. With freedom annihilated, language that expresses human being in the impersonal idiom of physics will be most apt. Perfection is both his and not his insofar as he recognizes that his qualities are the gifts of an all-good God. Thus, when Dante tells his reader to stare at the heavenly wheels (Par. X, 7), he seems at first glance unwittingly to follow Plato's exercitatio which employed astronomy to educate the Guardians, but his goal is actually to direct his reader toward the origin of all quality, toward home. Reason teaches a limited newness. In the Consolation of Philosophy, Lady Philosophy helped Boethius recover his true nature by showing him that what he calls goods are not necessarily good for man; that in any case they should not be transformed into absolutes, because human nature far surpasses them, and that they only belong to Fortune anyway. Lady Philosophy excoriates the love of honor, claiming that honors bestowed upon the wicked only underscore their dishonor: And why does this happen? It happens because you choose to call things by false names, even though the things in question may be quite different, and the things are then found to contradict their names by their effects. Therefore, material possessions are not rightly called riches, worldly power is not true power, and public honor is not true honor, (p. 36) 268</page><page sequence="15">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. chiampi The circling of the Paradiso works to the illumination of this notion. Thus in Paradiso XXIII, 130-132, we learn what true wealth is (and again in XXVII, 9); this is spelled out in Canto X: "Ne la corte del cielo, ond' io rivegno, / si trovan molte gioie care e belle / tanto che non si posson trar del regno" (w. 70-72). Such jewels are safe from Vanni Fucci. In Paradiso XXIV, 1-3, pace Ciacco, we learn what true food is, and through- out the canticle, pace Pier della Vigna, what true honor and glory are. Dante is performing an activity of redefinition, finding the proper names for things. Beatrice's words - "L'alto disio che mo t'infiamma e urge, / d'aver notizia di cio che tu vei, / tanto mi piace quanto piu turge" (Par. XXX, 70-72) - by their ambiguous imagery suggest the love excessive sensuality forecloses. God's "great munificence" (Par. XXXI, 88-90), true wealth, is actually the means by which man is freed from the body and made pleasing to Him. We can surmise that to be present to an omniscient God is true fame. To be recalled to the self-sufficiency he once knew man/woman must become indifferent to earthly goods. Let us return to the artes liberates, keeping in mind that they can pose the soul many of the same dangers as poetry; above all inspiring an idolatrous absorption that treats them as terminal values. Dante's geome- try is personal, as in these words the Pilgrim speaks to Cacciaguida: "O cara piota mia che si t'insusi, che, come veggion le terrene menti non capere in triangol due ottusi, cosi vedi cose contingenti anzi che sieno in se, mirando il punto a cui tutti i tempi son presenti." (Par. XVII, 13-18) Here geometry's axiomatic certitude is merely an analogy for the certitude of Providence that underlies history's incessant change. The point that gave rise to time - and to what lies beyond it - is now seen to bring together all time in itself. In the Pilgrim's words to Cacciaguida, geometry reveals its instrumental nature - it is the vehicle for a descrip- tion of the achievement of human happiness, the complete satisfaction of the intellect and will. And it underscores a difference: the intellectual may be satisfied by scientia, but the Christian yearns for the sapientia it reveals, a certitude created in imitation of the Word. Boethius claimed that the highest creation is the human will, which can love - make use 269</page><page sequence="16">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 of - itself, and, we must recall, that it itself is by no means a terminal value. Speaking with Cacciaguida, the Poet reveals the anagogy of such self-love when the Pilgrim gazes at his own will - directed toward God - in loving admiration like a redeemed Narcissus: "Per tanti rivi s'empie d'allegrezza / la mente mia, che di se fa letizia / perche puo sostener che non si spezza" (Par. XVI, 19-21). The Pilgrim rejoices in the very capacity of his mind to contain the immutable, but the immutable here is not geometry. Geometry's role was to suggest, however dimly, that we are capax Dei. As in Augustine, geometry's proportions offer no happiness in themselves to compare with that which comes from following them back to their origin in Pure Form. The intellectual knows light when he grasps the geometrical point, and can come to know a certain limited self-sufficiency, but it is joyless compared to the light Beatrice knows in the Empyrean, the mind of God, a "luce intellectual, piena d'amore; / amor di vero ben, pien di letizia" (Par. XXX, 40-41), perfect self-sufficiency.22 The Poet joins the artes arithmetic, geometry and music in rendering what Platonic intellectualism could not know, the Christian God: QuelTuno e due e tre che sempre vive e regna sempre in tre e 'n due e 'n uno, non circunscritto, e tutto circunscrive, tre volte era cantato da ciascuno di quelli spiriti con tal melodia, ch'ad ogne merto saria giusto muno. (Par. XIV, 28-33) Once again the Poet shows that geometry is itself finally a sign which can be followed back to its origin in goodness, the pure order that makes this a rational cosmos. But that is at the same time to say that the origin and end of geometry is mysterium, for geometry's unchanging axioms and relations arise from the surd of three persons in one God.23 In these verses, Dante has made one and two and three a name of God, and taken such an arithmetic, as well as geometry and music, and related them to justice ("giusto muno"), which is his principle of spiritual form. Dante's God here transcends and annuls intellectual arithmetic with a portrayal of an arithmetic that lives, shapes, and intervenes; thus Cacciaguida invokes God, "trino e uno, / che nel mio seme se' tanto cortese" (Par. XV, 48-49). Arithmetic, after all, cannot comprehend what defies the law 270</page><page sequence="17">Dante's Paradiso/rom Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI of identity, A = A. (How would an intellectual regard the notion of a virgin mother who is daughter of her son? As the foolishness of God.) The difficulty of Cacciaguida's arithmetic name of God serves as yet another mute underscoring of the carnal banality of Francesca s name of God, "3 re de l'universo" (Inf. V, 91). As Augustine and Dante would have it, geometry and astronomy are transcended by the Cross in Heaven: si costellati facean nel profbndo Marte quei raggi il venerabil segno che fan giunture di quadranti in tondo. Qui vince la memoria mia lo 'ngegno; che quella croce lampeggiava Cristo, si ch'io non so trovare essempro degno. (Par. XIV, 100-105) A geometrical cross is simply a figure created where two lines intersect at right angles, but this Cross possesses a quasi-sacramental nature, seeming to bring about by grace what it symbolizes. Thus, while any such intersection of straight lines might awaken reason to ideal entities, the Cross occasions wordless rapture in the pious - the Cross "che mi rapiva, sanza intender l'inno" (Par. XIV, 121-123). Dante has yielded up his attention to the Cross, which binds him more tightly than could art, love, the artes liberates, or the diverse fascinations of hell, as if to show that piety is a higher form of wisdom. These quadrants within the circle are an index of the Pilgrim's spiritual development, because they look forward to their fusion in the final image, that of the geometer seeking to square the circle. They make it clear that in some way it will be less an isolated image than the culmination of a development toward an encounter with perfect human being. If the familiar conventions of love poetry enraptured Francesca, here a geometric figure enraptures Dante which is incarnated historically in the Cross of Christ. In Christ's nature as true God and true man, we have the mysterium that reconciles a divine love of the world with human contemptus mundi. He is the crucified - crossed - point. Being Christlike means imitating the perfect human will in its act of love. Heaven is the immutable place proper to man possessed of reason, which on earth permitted him to know such immutable things as the truths of geometry, arithmetic and music. As these liberal disciplines helped man toward self-sufficiency - a 271</page><page sequence="18">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 love of the world which does not know it as a terminal value - here in Heaven these disciplines are revealed to be themselves instrumental to the goal of salvation, man's highest desire: Ivi e perfetta, matura e intera ciascuna disi'anza; in quella sola e ogne parte la ove sempr' era, perche non e in loco e non s'impola; e nostra scala infino ad essa varca. (Par. XXII, 64-68) The final vision (Par. XXXIII, 127-135), which Dante renders as Christ in the circling is, from this perspective, the point where the exemplarity of perfect personhood crosses the scientia of the artes. But this is also the final repudiation of the non-Christian rationalist at the same time, for the point that will enrapture the Pilgrim is fused with the human flesh of Christ that was assumed into Heaven after His Resurrection.24 To return for a moment to astronomical imagery: the eclipse of the sun when Christ died (Par. XXVII, 36) could be said to announce the final transcendence of the pretensions of unaided intellect by the mysterium of the incarnate Word's participation in history. The authority of the New Testament now guides man to a higher knowledge than unaided reason could have provided, as we learn from the Pilgrim's examination on charity: "Per filosofici argomenti / e per autorita che quinci scende / cotale amor convien che in me si 'mprenti" (Par. XXVI, 25-27). In response the Pilgrim hears: "Per intelletto umano / e per autoritadi a lui concorde / d'i tuoi amori a Dio guarda il sovrano" (Par. XXVI, 46-48). This is as if to say, all well and good, but what else draws you to God? The Pilgrim's answer: belief in Christ's death, which has saved him from the sea of misdirected love, and set him on the shore of charity. Ulysses could not boast so much. Authority alone and authority abetted by reason direct love where the unaided intellect cannot reach: "O benigna vertu che si li 'mprenti, / su t'essaltasti per largirmi loco / a li occhi li che non t'eran possenti" (Par. XXIII, 85-87). The subjects of the Pilgrim's examinations - faith, hope and charity - are the means to a higher vision than unaided reason provides, cleansing the inner sight as they direct it beyond the material world. 272</page><page sequence="19">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI Following the humbling of the artes, poetry renounces its pretension to autonomy of the natural order. Loving God as summum bonum, as final object of the will, the souls praise that righteousness which expresses itself in each object's location in the place it belongs: "Qui si rimira ne l'arte ch'addorna / cotanto affetto, e discernesi '1 bene / per che '1 mondo di su quel di giu torna" (Par. IX, 106-108). This is to progress from the love of one's own rightly directed will to love of the Exemplar's will, which is turned to itself as its highest object (Par. XXXIII, 124-126). The souls smile on account of the "valor ch'ordino e provide" (Par. IX, 105) - esthetic inevitability. Providence, which makes creation both apt and beautiful, is the final absorbing artwork, because the possession of unlimited good, from which no one can turn, is necessarily a yielding of the attention to God. This is all part of Pilgrim's exercitatio: the vision of Heaven which kept the Pilgrim's vision moving from part to part (Par. XXXI, 52-54), and only yields to fixity in the Empyrean, will free him from entrapment in art when he returns to earth.25 If Plato's guardians found harmony liberating, here a personal astron- omy in the form of a chorus of the blessed liberates the Pilgrim by carrying on the catharsis the neo-Platonists rejected: "Io m'innamorava tanto quinci, / che 'nfino a li non fu alcuna cosa / che mi legasse con si dolci vinci" (Par. XIV, 127-129). Celestial harmony has freed the Pilgrim from the entrapping harmonies of the songs of earth. Here the inappro- priate enjoyment of music, as in the encounter with Casella, is repudi- ated. This harmony knows God as its end; it is laudatively and sacrificially referential - not proudly autonomous - according to the law formu- lated in Paradise: "Pero che '1 ben, ch'e del volere obietto, / tutto s'accoglie in lei, e fuor di quella / e defettivo cio ch'e li perfetto" (Par. XXXIII, 103-105). This overcoming of poetry is actually poetry's homecoming: the Paradiso is imbued with a neo-Platonic Christian nostalgia for the world of transcendent beauty from which the soul exiled itself in sin, but whose memory survives to guide every judgment of beauty. Each intransitive moment - the experience of poetry - which is freedom in Heaven is entrapment on earth. Every mundane experience of absorp- tion in poetry unknowingly looks backward to the origin of both art and an - this poem itself - in Heaven. Here we have the decisive surpassing of Platonic contemplation in a universe that further asserts its rationality by satisfying human desire: "Io sentiva osannar di coro in coro / al punto 273</page><page sequence="20">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 fisso che li tiene a li ubi, / e terra sempre, ne' quai sempre fiioro" (Par. XXVIII, 94-96). Unlike the geometers point, this point not only holds each soul in its proper place, but circumscribes all position. In these verses, the language of geometry speaks of the satisfaction of the human will by an infinite object. But then, were man/woman's yearnings incapable of fulfilment, the universe would not be rational, and we like Virgil would live without hope in desire. Dante has taken poetry and shown that its intransitive power does not lie in its material being, but beyond it. Doing so, he reveals that the reader s esthetic experience of the loss of self is a shadowy preface of pious self-sacrifice. In other words, like all Christian love, our proper use (utt) of the poem must be self-transcending. To recapitulate: we begin with the punto that overcame Francesca, and, as we continue our reading, with faith guiding an inquiring reason, come to see that the final Punto is inextended being, God Himself, and that for reasons we cannot know, He as Father required that His Son be punto (Par. XXXII, 6) in order that we might return to Him. And if our natural love makes us arrows directed at that Punto, a point which circumscribes and encloses all creation, then that arrow strikes everywhere. To help him achieve newness of vision, Dante asks that his reader read in a praising, self-sac- rificing - i.e., pious - way to the end, where poetry's numbers return to their origin in divine mind.

Ryan [Garden City, New Jersey: Doubleday, I960]): Sometimes I think that I grant [melodies] more honor than is proper. This is when I feel our spirits aroused to a flaming piety more devoutly and ardently by such sacred words when they are sung well than if they are not so chanted, and when I see that all our spiritual affections, in keeping with their diversity, have corresponding modes of voice and song and are stirred up by a kind of secret propriety. But this sensual pleasure, to which the soul must not be delivered so as to be weakened, often leads me astray, when sense does not accompany reason in such wise as to follow patiendy after it, but, having won admittance for reason's sake, even tries to run ahead and lead reason on. Thus in such things I unconsciously sin, but later I am conscious of it. (p. 261) 7. Vol. 30, The Gospel of Grace, ed. and trans. Cornelius Ernst, O.P.

The choice of Plotinus would have been more historically precise in discussing Augustine's Neo-Platonism. Dante, of course, had no direct access to the Republic. 1 1 . See St. Augustine, The Magnitude of The Soul: A line has no other extension than that of length. Now, if you take away the only extension a line has, namely length, nothing of extension remains. Therefore, whatever is superior to a line is necessarily without extent and admits no division or cutting whatever. Therefore, all for naught is our labor in seeking after the soul's magnitude; there is no such thing, since the soul, we grant, is superior to a line. (pp. 84-85) Augustine makes his point about the relationship between geometry and human identity in an elegant conclusion on the next page: "In divine Providence it cannot happen that the pious, chaste, and diligent quest of religious souls for themselves and their God, that is, for truth, should go unrequited" (p. 86). 12. In his article "Christian Philosophy: The Intellectual Side of Augustine's Conversion" (Augustinian Studies, xvii [1986]), Eugene Kevane makes the interesting observation: Augustine's philosophy rests on a metaphysics which ascends to the Supreme Being who is a Person, the source of the being, unity, truth and goodness of the natures which constituted the created cosmos. This metaphysics is akin to prayer. In fact, it provides the rational foundation for prayer, (pp. 74-75) 275</page><page sequence="22">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 In Sermon CXXX - falsely attributed to Augustine - we read "Quid autem est oratio, nisi ascensio animae de terrestribus ad caelestia, inquisitio supernorum, invisibilium desiderium" (PL XXXIX, 1886-1887). In this very broad sense, the Paradiso becomes a prayer. 13. Consider Augustine on humility, its sublimity and relation to grace in Concerning the City of God Against the Pagans (trans. Henry Bettenson [Harmondsworth, Baltimore and Ringwood: Penguin Books, 1972]): I know how great is the effort needed to convince the proud of the power and excellence of humility, an excellence which makes it soar above all the summits of this world, which sway in their temporal instability, overtopping them all with an eminence not arrogated by human pride, but granted by divine grace, (p. 5) Nowhere does he damn its contrary, pride, more forcefully than in The Trinity (trans. Stephen McKenna, C.SS.R., vol. 45 of The Fathers of the Church [Washington: The Catholic University of America Press, 1963]): There are certain ones, however, who think themselves capable by their own strength of being purified, so as to see God and to inhere in God, whose very pride defiles them above all others. For there is no vice which the divine law resists more, and over which that most proud spirit, the mediator to things below and the obstacle to things above, receives a greater power of domination: unless one either avoids the secret snares he is laying by going along a different way, or if he is openly raging through a sinful people, which is interpreted Amelec, and by his opposition denies the passage to the land of promise, he be overcome by the cross of Christ, which was prefigured by the extended hands of Moses, (p. 156) In the Confessions, Augustine admits this vice prevented his learning from Scripture: None such as I was at that time could enter into it, nor could I bend my neck for its passageways. When I first turned to that Scripture, I did not feel towards it as I am speaking now, but it seemed to me unworthy of comparison with the nobility of Cicero's writing. My swelling pride turned away from its humble style, and my sharp gaze did not penetrate into its inner meaning. But in truth it was of its nature that its meaning would increase together with your little ones, whereas I disdained to be a little child and, puffed up with pride, I considered myself to be a great fellow, (p. 82) 14. Trans. D. W. Robertsonjr. (Indianapolis and New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1958), 10. 15. Trans. Thomas F.Gilligan,O.S.A.,in vol. 1 of The Writings of St. Augustine, (New York: Cima, 1948), 357. Dante affirms this point when he feels joy in the scriptive present recalling how he read the book of the universe: "La forma universal di questo nodo / credo ch'i' vidi, perche piu di largo, / dicendo questo, mi sento ch'i' godo" (Par. xxxiu 91-93). 16. It is tempting to find in Of True Religion (trans. J. H. S. Burleigh [Chicago, Illinois: Regnery, 1966]) a relationship between the enjoyment of what moderns call art and pride: It is sin which deceives souls, when they seek something that is true but abandon or neglect truth. They love the works of the artificer more than the artificer or his art, and are punished by falling into the error of expecting to find the artificer and his art in his works, and when they cannot do so they think that the works are both the art and the artificer. God is not offered to the corporeal senses, and transcends even the mind. This is the origin of all impiety of sinners who have been condemned for their sins. Not only do they wish to scrutinize the creation contrary to the commandment of God, and to enjoy it rather than God's law and truth - that was the sin of the first man who misused his free will - but in their state of condemnation they also make this 276</page><page sequence="23">Dante's Paradiso from Number to Mysterium, JAMES T. CHIAMPI addition to their sin. They not only love but also serve the creature rather than the Creator, and worship the parts of the creation from the loftiest to the lowliest, (pp. 64-65) Hence the poet will claim that the speaking reliefs of Purgatory x were "per il fabbro loro a veder care" (99). Enjoying the work of art for its own sake is a prideful act that recalls that of Adam. 17. Consider, for example, Boethius in The Consolation of Philosophy (trans. Richard Green [Indianapolis and New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1962]): We believe that our just humility may earn the priceless reward of divine grace, for this is the only way in which men seem able to communicate with God; we are joined to that inaccessible light by supplication before receiving what we ask.

On the theme of the point, see also Franco Masciandaro's sensitive and useful article, "Notes on the Image of the Point in the Divine Comedy" Italica, LIV (1977), 215-226. One wonders if Augustine's words in the first book of the Confessions do not offer Dante the inspiration for the movement I am describing: "One and one are two, and two and two are four" was for me a hateful chant, while the wooden horse full of armed men, the burning of Troy, and Creusa's ghost were most sweet but empty spectacles, (p. 57) Francesca was one who did not yearn for the geometrical point, but contented herself with the sweet but empty spectacles of chivalric romance. 20. As we have seen, cold geometry is indecorous, but it is not the only way Dante alienates the reader. Consider the Poet's words describing the fourth heaven, the Heaven of the Sun: "Tal era quivi la quarta famiglia / de l'alto Padre, che sempre la sazia, / mostrando come spira e come figlia" (Par. x, 49-51). It should be borne in mind that "spirare" and "figliare" are the Father's act of reading/loving the Word (Par. x, 1-6). But if we cast a carnal glance at the killing letter, we find that the Father shows his family, the blessed, how he begets - a repellent image indeed. This is little different from the description of Francis's affair with the despised hag, Poverty (Par. XI, 60), or the sexual image of the bell of Paradiso x, 139-144 - all heirs of the tradition of the Song of Songs. But here one person of the triune point has become an obscene parent. What could be further removed from the austere dignity of geometry? But these images share with the geometrical this, that in their different ways they are scandalous affronts to literary decorum, examples perhaps of the "foolishness of God." In Heaven we are at a point that precedes and survives mundane ethics and literary sensibility. 21. It would be interesting to compare blessed Peter Damian's flaming with that of the false counselors Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro in Inferno xxvi, and thence with the conflagration Dante aims to cause (Par. I, 34). Their counsel was not sanctioned by the Holy Spirit and was importunate, unlike that of Peter Damian who had to be dragged from the cloister to the cardinalate, and that of the Poet. Peter Damian's sanction is underscored in his speech. Perhaps Justinian the law giver, whom we meet in the Heaven of Mercury, is a more cogent example: "Per piu letizia si mi si nascose / dentro al suo raggio la figura santa" (Par. v, 136-137). Light is not flame, of course, but that is the point: light is another version of home, one contrary to the darkness of the isolated ego Bernard described in De Diligendo Deo. And as Augustine showed, it is scrutiny of the inner light which reveals the truths of geometry and arithmetic that aids our voyage home. 22. On light in the Paradiso, see Charles S. Singleton's magisterial pages in Dante Studies 2: Journey to Beatrice (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1958), 15-38. 277</page><page sequence="24">Dante Studies, CX, 1992 23.
