The conjunction of persons and things names, for Barbara Johnson, a   fundamental ethical problem: if it’s the case that the relation between them  structures the way we live, if we tend to treat persons as things and our  “humanness is mired in an inability to do otherwise,” then how is it possible  to disentangle them, to imagine living “in a world where persons treat per- sons as persons” (2)? We dream of things (Pygmalion’s statue, Frankenstein’s  creature, an automaton) becoming persons, and in slavery and its myriad  informal forms we treat persons as objects of our will. What’s normal is the  entanglement of personhood and thinghood, an ambiguity spelled out in the  passage between the four sections of the book: “Things,” “The Thingliness  of Persons,” “The Personhood of Things,” and “Persons.”   The relation, and the ambiguity, can be understood in terms of three  divergent and perhaps incommensurable dimensions of analysis: “the reality  of desire, the reality of materiality, and the reality of rhetoric” (3). A series  of fi gures running through the book corresponds, although never explicitly,  to each dimension: to the reality of desire, the fi gure of narcissism and its  constitutive lack; to the reality of materiality, the fi gure of the statue and its  cognate forms, the doll, the puppet, the automaton, and so on; and to the  reality of rhetoric, the fi gure of address. Of these, the dominant dimension  is that of rhetoric, and one way of reading the book is simply as a set of  meditations on that encounter “with something inanimate at the heart of  what we think is ourselves” (229) that so constantly provoked Paul de Man’s  attention in the act of reading. But rhetoric is, before this, a way of bringing  inanimate things to life. Emile Benveniste’s argument that only the “I” and  the “you” are grammatical “persons” is grounded in the assumption that “the  notion of ‘person’ has something to do with presence at the scene of speech  comparative literature studies, vol. 47, no. 2, 2010.

The converse, then, holds  true: that the way to treat a thing (the “it”) as a person is to address it, to  treat it as an interlocutor in the scene of speech.   Four key tropes effect the transformation of things into persons. Two of  them—prosopopoeia (which Johnson associates with the epitaph, the feigned  speech of the dead to the living) and apostrophe—are fi gures of address;  anthropomorphism and personifi cation, by contrast, are direct assertions  of being. The question of personhood takes place in the interstice between  these two pairs: we assume that the human self is a person rather than a  thing, but—in an argument that has also been central to Charles Taylor’s  thinking about selfhood—“if the ‘self ’ becomes an object of knowledge, it  can o nly be known as an object among other objects” (47).   The fi gure of Narcissus condenses some of the complexity of what’s  at stake here. On the one hand, it plays out a confusion of the self with  the other and of selfhood with aesthetic form. On the other, it dramatizes  the question of whether the self can have a content, since Narcissus’s self- recognition is constitutively a misrecognition that gives form to that self  that seems to precede it: “The image offers a fi ction of wholeness that the  subject will strive to resemble” (58–59), a  thing that the self will always,  necessarily, fail to become.   That otherness of the mirror image is akin to the exemplary otherness  and thingness of Kleist’s puppets, the embodiment of a superhuman grace,  and it may thus be the case that the structure of human subjectivity must  be thought in terms of our ability to be or to be like a thing, that “identity  is an object . . . without which there would be no subject” (181). The book  explores this insight through a range of types of animated thingness. Each  chapter brings together, in an argument that is essayistic rather than linear,  a complex of thing/person relations: the fi gure of the jug or urn or vase in  Heidegger, Keats, and Stevens, where thingness is structured as the shaping of  an enclosed void; the prosthesis, troubling the borderline between the human  and the nonhuman; Greek statuary and its relation both to the romantic lyric  and to the structuring of gender and racial typologies; cybertoys, replicants,  robots, and Barbie dolls (mass-cultural forms are almost always the bad  object in this book); Winnicott’s transitional object, by means of which we  learn (or fail to learn) to “use” others in appropriate ways; the face as the sign  of uniqueness and naked selfhood but also as the “thing addressed” (208)  rather than as a substance; the anthropomorphism at the heart of the lyric  and its relation to legal personifi cation, which encompasses both “natural”  and corporate persons; the fetish and its relation to aesthetic form; and a  number of other variations on these themes.

Yet for all their emphasis on the  entanglement of persons and things, these readings go back on their own  best insights and work ultimately to keep them apart: “The question of things  turns out to be a question of things for people,” and the book’s key concern  is with “how identifi cation and idealization are mediated by people’s rela- tions to things” (229). I can perhaps best signal why this notion of things as  mediators seems unsatisfactory by contrasting it with the way the question  of the relation of persons to things is treated in another discipline, that of  science and technology studies. In the work of Bruno Latour and Michel  Callon, among others, the nature of the subject of action within a network  is left indeterminate: actors may be primarily human or nonhuman, but both  humans and nonhumans are understood as always ontologically mixed. In  Latour’s terms, Johnson is continuing that work of ontological separation  and purifi cation that is at the core of the modernist project. Were she not so  brilliant an exponent of her own discipline, she might have been more open  to the radical implications of those other disciplines where the question of  persons and things is put to the question.

This meticulously researched and well-documented book by Mark Gamsa  presents a discursive examination of the nature and impact of the translation  of Russian literature into Chinese by focusing on three extended cases stud- ies, reviewing and synthesizing a rich wealth of social, historical, political,  and ideological contextual material surrounding the Chinese translations of  the three Russian writers, Savinkov, Artsybashev, and Andreev. This vast,  multifaceted study is thick with scholarly apparati, including, among other  things, an annex and glossary, and demonstrates scholarly rigor and critical  thinking. The period Gamsa covers was an exciting one, when there was  a bustling of translation of foreign literature into Chinese. Around 1933 a  series of what would be hard-fought debates on the subject of translation  was spawned that a number of illustrious literary fi gures took part in.
