Mind, No. 40, PP. 479-497- Green, though he makes reality consist in unchangingness through time, yet is forced to admit that nature is known as a process of change. A knowledge of this change, however, so he argues, cannot be a process in time. There are three reasons, all fallacious, brought forward in support of this contention. The first is a fallacy of equivocation, turning on the ambiguity of the word "I present." The second is a fallacy of accident, changing the concrete unity of successive acts into the abstract unity of non-successiveness. The third consists in analyzing what Green calls "the one indivisible unity of our consciousness" into its two aspects of subject and object, in separating the object thus obtained from the subject thus obtained, and then, upon recognition of its incompleteness, in completing it by putting it into essential relation with a principle other than that subject. This is due to the fact that the empirical subject is constantly changing, and therefore cannot, it is thought, be the sufficient presupposition of an unchang- ing reality. Having already interpreted the reality of the world of objects to mean its unalterableness, Green now thinks he is under the necessity of postulating an eternal subject to complement it. The eternity of the sub- ject, though often nominally identified with timelessness, is really conceived by Green, as his own expressions show, to be a monotonous everlasting- ness. The relation between this eternal consciousness and our temporal consciousness Green states in what are often taken as mere metaphors; but he himself claims, in using these metaphors, that they "explain." If any meaning is given to them, it is that our consciousness, qua changing, consists in successive modifications of the animal organism, while our con- sciousness, qua consciousness, does not change. This is a denial of the indubitable fact of change in consciousness as consciousness, a fact as well authenticated as any fact of change. Green's whole idea of the eternal con- sciousness must be rejected, but the concept of eternity still has a place in</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 8I philosophy. (i) The whole universe, including past, present, and future regarded as a single system, transcends any and every point of time within it; i. e., it is an eternal system. (2) Every element in the universe, though occurring at a certain date, determines the nature of occurrences at other times. It dynamically transcends time, i. e., has dynamic eternity. (3) Consciousness, which is an event occurring at a certain time, is not lim- ited, in what it may know, to simultaneous objects. It may know what is past and what is future. It thus functionally transcends its own time of occurrence ; i. e., is functionally eternal. THE AUTHOR. The Problem of a " Logic of the Emotions " anid Affective Memory. WIL- BUR M. URBAN. Ps. Rev., VIII, 3, 4, pp. 262-278, 360-370. This problem arises because the concrete mental sciences are turning to volitional and emotional points of view. Recent developments in ethics and -esthetics assume that continuity in the sphere of values presupposes a generalizing and abstracting process upon affective values, resulting in emotional abstracts relatively independent of particularizing ideal elements and capable of subsuming particular emotions. Concerning the assertion that psychology cannot treat of meanings and values, we answer that values are in consciousness, and have a right to an adequate psychology. The emotional unity of a work of art consists in the maintaining of a given mood or sentiment containing the varied particular emotional tendencies started by the particular content subsumed. The facts of ethical and emotional sanction show the same expansive tendency. On its affective side, ethical judgment consists in the subsumption of particular feelings under general forms of emotionalism having well-defined objective values. The extension is empirical when a mood or sentiment tends to extend itself over all content of consciousness associated in time with the original stim- ulus. Then there is a logical extension the nature of which can be discov ered only by finding the common element in the particular and the abstract emotion. The extension must be by subsumption here, and the relation- ship must be judgmental. Therefore there must be some equivalence of value between the two affective states. The ultimate of actual affective experience is the simple emotion. An affective tone has no meaning until it passes into some tendency to motor reaction. No adequate theory of affective complexes can be derived from the simple elements of pleasure, pain, and ideas. The selective processes of generalization must take hold of the ultimates having conscious meaning, namely, motor tendencies in their relation to volition, in order to develop complexes of higher meaning. If the higher affective state is related to the particular emotion as general to particular by subsumption, it must have been developed by generalization. The structure of sentiments and modes makes the relation of subsumption possible. In the generic phases of emotionalism there is a dampening of the intensity of the hedonic and sensational components. What positive</page><page sequence="3">82 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. element remains constant in sentiments and moods, making it possible to subsume particular emotions so as to give aesthetic truth ? Any emotion is a generic image. When I try to realize an emotion, say ' fear,' I find a succession of motor tendencies and images. These are all parts of the generic emotion ' fear, ' because of a common dynamic element. However these reactions may differ in the quality of their organic sensations, there is a dynamic constant that makes them generic. By dynamic constant we mean a relatively permanent system of intensities and of temporal and rhythmic relationships among the organic sensations of an emotional reac- tion. The dynamic constant is the essence of an emotional state. The great ethical, religious, and Esthetic sentiments are assimilations on the basis of this dynamic constancy. The meaning of emotional values is in terms of this relation to volitional efficiency. As extrinsic values they are conceived as the causal presupposition of judgments and acts. Viewed inwardly, they may be described as dynamic constants, and their value lies in their dynamical relations to volition. Perhaps on this theory it may be possible to say that the value of feelings is not measured merely by their hedonic intensity, but also by ' their breadth and depth in the personality.' The second part of this discussion treats of affective memory. Can an emotional state be presented and represented to consciousness ? Affective memory is the presupposition of any theory of emotional continuity and evolution. When we compare ideal memory and recognition with affective memory, we find corresponding to the voluntary recall of sensational images a so-called voluntary recall of emotional states. The object of the recall is a past emotion which is recognized as such when it comes. Parallel with the spontaneous appearance of images in consciousness, there are cases of a spontaneous appearance of particular emotional states, recognized as familiar before the appearance of ideal content. We often recognize new emotions or moods in life or art as familiar. The continuity of the affective life is based upon the recognition of affective states. Memory reduces itself largely to recognition, and this to the liability of reproduction of the organic element making up the mood of recognition. The question now becomes: Is feeling, emotion, capable of becoming the pre-supposition of a judgment feeling of familiarity ? The question must be decided by em- pirical research. Many experiments tend to confirm it. Pleasure and pain cannot be represented, but emotional theories of art now place the emotional state in the sphere of content. The recognition of affective states seems to rest upon the dynamical relations of the elements of the emotional states. G. W. T. WHITNEY. L'abstraction inteilectuelle. G. DE CRAENE. Rev. Neo-Scolastique, VIII, 3, pp- 243-258. In man, knowledge attains to a degree of perfection not to be reached by the animal. Unless we allow a distinction in kind between the mind of man and that of the animal, it is vain to insist that the human species</page><page sequence="4">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 83 forms a separate kingdom. Such a distinguishing mark we have in the power of abstraction peculiar to the human intellect. The animal fur- nishes positive proof that it lacks this faculty by which man enters into relation with the Absolute and the divine. On the other hand, no man lives, no matter how ignorant, who is not in constant touch with the uni- versal. By what incomprehensible miracle do we come to a knowledge of this object, which can never be perceived through the senses ? The repre- sentations of sense are as much external as internal in their origin. But our knowledge must be considered an internal act. The abstraction of the intellect is not to be considered as the division of a whole into its parts. It is rather that act in which the intelligence recognizes in the individual its own proper object, the essence or universal. Consequently, intelligence lays especial emphasis upon the essence, the universal nature of the object, and neglects its individual peculiarities. In this way alone the mind gains by the abstracting process a concept of the object. Moreover, we are thereby enabled to form an idea or image which is not limited in applica- tion to the particular individual. In fact, it applies to each and every indi- vidual whose name, mentally pronounced, allows it to be included under the one image. From its very nature this generalizing thought-process is apt to be inadequate, because it neglects individual characteristics and peculiarities. H. W. WRIGHT. L'idke moderne de la nature. C. BOUGLE'. Rev. de Met., IX, 5, pp. 529- 555. M. Bougle has classified the conceptions of nature that have prevailed during the nineteenth century according as they were more mechanical and less anthropomorphic in terminology and conception. There have been three main biological theories that exemplify the change from the anthro- pomorphic finalist of the middle of the century, to the more strictly mechanical view now generally held. These theories and their chief repre- sentatives are: Differentiation-Milne-Edwards, descent or heredity-Lam- arck, and natural selection-Darwin. Although chronologically, Lamarck precedes Milne-Edwards, logically the theory of descent follows that of differentiation. The question that these naturalists sought to answer was: By what law can one explain the diverse forms of nature ? Milne Edwards answered, by differentiation. But differentiation, aside from being inade- quate to the facts as a biological theory, is largely conceived and worked out in terms of anthropomorphism. Milne-Edwards went so far as to liken nature to a rational artist arranging the statues in his studio. Lamarck, in attempting to explain the diversity of animal forms, noticed that between typical forms there must have existed a large number of intermediate forms. It followed, therefore, that nature was not a ladder, but a chain. Lamarck formulated two laws that seemed to explain all the facts. (i) Variations of individuals are caused by the use and disuse of organs. (2) Such varia-</page><page sequence="5">84 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XI. tions are transmitted to offspring by heredity. This view of nature, while chronologically antecedent to that of Milne-Edwards, is really less anthro- pomorphic. The difference lies in the fact that Lamarck's theory is much more definitely mechanical, i. e., it has its own facts to explain, and after a fashion does explain them without reference to an end. Lamarck's theory is consequential while Milne-Edwards's is finalistic. The theory of natural selection explains how variations of individuals take place-which is, prac- tically, Lamarck's law of habit-and why certain features are perpetuated. The theory of natural selection completes and justifies, but at the same time does not exclude the theories of differentiation and descent. Nature for Darwin is not a unique will; it is a complexus of laws, themselves dis- covered not by the supposition of ends, but by the verification of facts. In conclusion, the author says: "If nature is personified, it is still to be understood that it is no longer a person; it has no loves or hates; only in- difference to things. Science has dispossessed it of all human attributes. Nature is no longer a voluntary thing; it is a machine." H. C. STEVENS. Philosofihy of Relzgion and the Endowment of N7atural Theology. R. M. WENLEY. Monist, XII, I, pp. 2 I-48. Owing to the unscientific nature of early apologetics, the dogmatic trend of medieval thought, the reactionary and rationalistic tendencies of the Renaissance, and the political and ecclesiastical character of the Refor- mation, a philosophy of religion did not exist prior to German idealism. Hegel's Vorlesungen aiber die Philoso15hie der Reltgion, of i829, is a nota- ble landmark. In the eighteenth century there was a growing freedom from dogmatic reservations; but the indispensable genetic method was not found. Both deists and churchmen accepted the Newtonian philosophy with its hypothesis of gravitation. The universe was explained by inves- tigating the relations subsisting between masses of matter. The ultimate properties of matter were attributed to an agent. Natural theology dis- cussed design, revealed theology depended upon miracle; but the limits and directions of each study were determined by the same general view. The world was regarded as little more than crass substance operated on from a distance by an inscrutable Being. The human soul was defined as a simple incorporeal substance. Under these conditions philosophy of religion could not arise. The persistence of a theistic interest in English thought is shown by the liberal endowments which have been given to natural theology. The Burnett foundation in 1784 was on the orthodox side, though with no undue rigidity. The Bridgewater fund in i829 formed the basis of the last great works on natural theology. They were, however, of little value, because they neglected the German move- ment. Gifford was not a professional philosopher; but yet was possessed by a stern passion for ultimate truth. He appreciated the work of Cole- ridge, Carlyle, and Emerson; and was dissatisfied with the dualism and</page><page sequence="6">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 8 5 individualism of the British mind. Although he himself was unable en- tirely to transcend the limitations of his time, yet the endowment, which he left in I 887, has done much to substitute for natural theology, the organic and historical view that was originated by Herder, partially developed by Kant, and perfected by Hegel. N. E. TRUMAN. Cosside~rations sur le beau et les beaux-arts. DR. HALLEZ. Rev. N6o- Scolastique, VIII, 3, pp. 225-242. Beauty comes under the category of the agreeable, i. e., of that which gives or may give pleasure. It may be defined as " a natural perfection belonging to a thing perceived through szght or hearing, by virtue of which perfection a normal mind experiences pleasure." A " normal mind " is one unvitiated by sickness, bodily need, prejudice, or suggestion. There is also an intellzgible beauty-" that which it is agreeable to conceive." " Beings superior to man conceive of objects, and their knowledge gives them pleasure: but as, properly speaking, they neither see nor hear, sen- sible beauty is relative to man alone." Form, duration, and rhythm are characteristics common to both visible and audible beauty. The object of the fine arts is aesthetic beauty. Their immediate aim-to produce pleas- ure-is justified by the legitimate human need for rest and distraction. Literature, painting, and sculpture have, besides, a direct moral influence. Music has no such direct power, but is an admirable means of relaxation. GEORGIA BENEDICT. Le beau dans la nature. L. BRAY. Rev. Ph., XXVI, IO, PP. 379-408. There exists in the realm of nature, both animal and vegetable, not only a certain degree of organization, but, furthermore, a tendency on the part of the individual to distinguish itself from the other members of its species, and to attract to itself the attention of individuals of its own and of other species. This tendency, whether mechanical, instinctive, or self-conscious, is intimately connected with the function of reproduction. To this tendency are traceable the origination and development of those qualities of color, form, sound, movement, etc.-which constitute for us the beauties of the animal and vegetable worlds. Exceptions to this rule decrease in number as we ascend the scale of life. Among the higher species of animals, sexual selection, and the need of mutual recognition- by individuals of the same and of different species, are the only sources of beautiful characteristics in the individual and in the species. This view demolishes at a single stroke the anthropocentric conception of beauty, and those aesthetic theories which strip beauty of its proper dignity by denying to it all direct connection with the fundamental needs of organisms. PEARL LOUISE HUNTER.</page><page sequence="7">86 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEWV. [VOL. XI. PSYCHOLOGICAL. A Case of Psychical Causation. W. H. SHELDON. Am. J. Ps. VIII, 6, 578-595- This paper discusses arguments which have been advanced against psychical causation: (i) Absence of observable necessary connection be- tween mental states (Hume). (2) Absence of discoverable quantitative equivalence between antecedent and consequent states. (3) Non-appear- ance in mental life of that continuous change which is a property of phys- ical causation. (4) The principle of parsimony maintaining the uselessness of introducing psychical causation since the order and character of psychical processes can be explained on a physiological basis. The thesis of the paper is, that there exists some one mental state which brings up other mental states, and brings them up in such manner that a real necessity is seen for their appearance. The idea of ' more' or of ' increasing' illustrates this attribute; the mental states which follow it are the ideas used in mental arithmetic. These latter are of such a psychological nature that their presence and their character can be seen to be derived from, and necessarily connected with, the original state. An analysis of the idea of more' reveals a two-fold content-the ideas of size and of movement or change. These two ideas coexist in organic union. Whenever we see anything which gives us the idea of Increase' (e. g., a moving object), we have the idea of size plus successive ideas of change. The entertainment of the idea of something which increases tends towards a consciousness of a series of increments. We are conscious that a relation exists between the increments, and we are led to seek out the character of this relation. Each such characterization is a new idea. But no new idea is in itself a sufficient characterization, so we have at each moment a still-to-be-characterized relation. An analysis of this complex relationship existing between the terms of the series reveals the various simpler relations of sameness, difference, different position in the series, moreness corresponding to later position, etc. But these do not exhaust the description of the relation of one increment to the next. There is then that about the relation more' which is more than we have seen. We view this new part as a ' more '; it is related to the already present content as 'more.' Therefore it too suggests, just as did the other, another element in between which again shall be more. Thus the relativity of 'more' neces- sitates an explicit process of self-repetition. And as each one of these new 'mores' has the same nature as the first, it follows that each involves a " same size repeated "; hence we have on our hands an infinite series of mores' which are all more than those preceding, and thus suggest a definition for each number as related to those preceding it, and so on indefinitely. This investigation of the possible relations between numbers, however, gives rise to arithmetic, algebra, etc. The necessity in these sciences will be due to the fact that number-relations are descriptions of an original material (some- thing that increases) which bring in no new content yet are the product of</page><page sequence="8">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 87 a natural movement found in the idea of ' more '-a movement of infinitely complex self-repetition. And this movement is a psychical causation. J. W. BAIRD. A Genetic Vzew of Spiace Percejftion. E. A. KIRKPATRICK. Am. J. Ps., VIII, 6, PP. 565-577. Space perception should be considered from the point of view of its bio- logical value. The earliest space-reactions in the life of the infant are reflex. From these is gradually built up a system of relations of sensa- tion-groups (a perception of space) during the course of the infant's reacting spatially in the attainment of practical ends-the point of refer- ence meanwhile being in the region of the mouth. Hence, consciousness of spatial relations is the result of space-reactions, not vice versa. The clearest appearance of an object gives the child his idea of that object. But appearance varies with distance and direction from the observer. Even the infant, however, can recognize the identity of the object throughout a series of changing appearances. Comparisons of these and of other appear- ances furnished in the handling of objects, lead to the gradual formation of ideas of distance, direction, size, and shape. J. W. BAIRD. Some Remarks on Conation. F. H. BRADLEY. Mind, No. 40, pp. 437-454. The main contention of this paper is that conation is something which we experience; that it is complex, and has in itself some inseparable aspects which therefore are experienced; that apart from these experienced aspects conation has lost its true meaning; and that the use of it in another mean- ing, if not illegitimate, is in psychology, at least, dangerous. On the basis of evidence furnished by the writer's own introspection, he assumes that conation can be experienced as such. He then goes on to enquire " about the minimum which can be taken to be contained in conation proper." (I) In experienced conation I am aware of an existence, a ' not-myself' to be altered. To the objection that what I strive to change may be my own self, and therefore not properly a not-self, the answer is that whatever is felt as an existence opposed to the self is for this purpose a not-self. (2) Because aware of a not-self as something to be changed, - I therefore must possess and use an idea of the change. I have, in other words, an end, however vague, and I have it also in my knowledge, and, if so, I must have an idea of a ' to be,' and without this idea there is no conation. " To this second point it may be objected that in some ' impulses' there is an activity directed to a certain end, of which the subject may have no idea at all. This objection we meet by denying that such impulses are cases of conation proper. They possess some, but not all the aspects of expe- rienced conation. Again, it may be objected that even if we admit that conation cannot be experienced without an awareness of something 'to be,' yet in. many cases where this feeling really exists, you cannot show</page><page sequence="9">88 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIE-W [VOL. XI. an idea. This objection rests upon a mistaken identification of the ideal with images. (3) Further, there is in conation the aspect of a ' myself' hindered by a ' not-myself,"' together with an idea of a change containing the removal of the hindrance." That is, the self is experienced as qual- ified by the idea of the altered object. (4) Finally, all these aspects must be experienced together, and must be felt as one whole, and, failing this, the experience of conation is destroyed. Conation, then, must possess cer- tain aspects, and apart from those it is not experienced conation. If you employ the term as meaning something else, you make use of a fiction. And not only is this fiction unsuccessful in explaining psychical facts, but it results in a confusion in which the genuine fact to be observed would tend to become lost to view. M. S. MACDONALD. Theories of mental activity. T. LOVEDAY. Mind, No. 40, pp. 455-478. In opposition to Professor Ward's claims that mental activity is known only by its effects, it is here maintained "that men do have a direct expe- rience which is called an experience or a perception of activity ; and this the psychologist may and must analyze, showing its constituents, conditions, and effects." The second part of this paper treats of conation and the triple division in psychology. Any division of mental life into cognitive, affective, and conative aspects is a division without a single basis, and car- ried through at different levels of abstraction. In the third part of the paper, the writer says that to Stout's two statements, (i) all mental life is active or self determined, and (2) this activity consists in being felt, two counter-statements might be opposed: (i) If there were always a feeling of activity, and if it always coincided with, or varied concomitantly with the degree of activity or self-determination, still this would be a matter of secondary importance, for the feeling could tell us nothing of the activity. No feeling, as such, tells us of more than its own presence. (2) Feeling and real cases of activity coincide only within the limits of common speech. This coincidence is due to the fact that the ordinary man abides by a com- paratively primitive use of the concept, and does not call himself active unless he has the feeling. But Stout does not conform to popular usage. His ' feeling' is an immediate experience, but his ' activity' is a conclusion drawn, not from the feeling, but from other grounds. He distinctly main- tains that a purely passive consciousness does not exist; but will any one seriously assert of himself that he always feels active ? To Stout's argu- ment that because so-called passive states are not all equally passive, there is therefore in them a low feeling of activity, we may reply, that by analogy every feeling of moderate wretchedness is a feeling of mild pleasure. M. S. MACDONALD. ETHICAL. Sotli5sismus auf fraktischem Gebiet. J. PETZOLDT. V. f. w. Ph., XXV, pp. 339-363- This article is a polemic against egoistic hedonism. The ethical theory</page><page sequence="10">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 89 of During is taken as representative of this position and criticised in detail. The egoistic hedonist is accused of the logical fallacy of solipsism, and the psychological error of substituting for the end of action in its concrete wholeness, a component part obtained by abstraction. The same logical fallacy is at the basis both of theoretical and practical solipsism. When it is asserted that there is nothing real except my idea, 'idea' loses its meaning and the statement comes to nothing. For ' idea' has meaning only in relation to that objective reality from which it is distinguished. If this does not exist, then 'idea' has entirely lost its significance. The logical contradiction fatal to solipsism is quite apparent, for its very intel- ligibility involves the existence of that reality which it denies. So it is with practical solipsism. The satisfaction of my will is to be understood only in reference to the satisfaction of other wills. But if every action is necessarily egoistic, then none are egoistic, for ' egoistic ' is so broadened in meaning that it loses its distinct significance and is merged with altru- istic. We are led simply to the recognition that the realization of every preconceived end involves pleasure, and that the representation of any desired object has an affective tone. But from this, the position of eudac- monism, it in nowise follows that the satisfaction of the self is the supreme end in human conduct. To maintain this is to fall victim to a glaring psy- chological error. In volition we represent an end and the means necessary to its accomplishment. Naturally, the end represented is effectively toned. It is not possible, however, to have a direct representation of a state of pleasure, but only a condition in which pleasure is one element. There- fore it is quite wrong to take this one element and make it the supreme end in conduct. The defender of hedonism is driven to maintain that the actual material out of which the ideal is constructed is related to its affective tone as means to end. H. W. WRIGHT. La morale ancienne et la morale moderne. G. CANTECOR. Rev. de MWt., IX, 5, pp. 556-578. In a recent article M. Brochard has demanded that the modern science of ethics be freed from its theological presuppositions (as the notions of duty and of a moral law), and be allowed to develop naturally along the lines laid down by the great philosophers of antiquity; for if " the notion of duty were an essential idea of reason . . . how could we explain the fact that it was never grasped by a Plato, an Aristotle, or an Epictetus ? " But, says M. Cantecor, this idea is a true development within the order of ethical speculation. The spontaneous use of reason precedes a recognition of its laws; the idea of duty is implicit in that idea of the good which so domi- nates ancient philosophical thought. " The notion of an imperative law arises naturally within man's reason, without any necessary connection with the idea of a transcendent authority upon which it depends . . . and the intuition of the necessity of such a law, or of a rational legislation, is the principal inspirer and regulator of all moral speculation." GEORGIA BENEDICT.</page><page sequence="11">90 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. Individu et society. M. BERNES. Rev. Ph., XXVI, II, PP. 478-5oo. If there is any characteristic common to all social facts, we must admit, regardless of our sociological opinions, that it is their relativity to the action of man upon man. A social fact, considered from this point of view, is a relation, the terms of which are individuals. One might say that individu- ality is the matter, and sociality the form, of this relation. Common sense and reflection alike tend to overlook the concrete and unitary reality of social facts, and to apotheosize the individual at the expense of the social whole, or vice versa, as the case may be. As a consequence of this tendency, there have appeared numerous individualistic and universalistic social the- ories more or less extreme and dogmatic in character. All such theories, just in the degree that they are extreme and dogmatic, are purely mytho- logical. That which lies at the basis of this, their mythological character, is the error of ultra analysis, and the hypostasis of the products of analysis. This is not to affirm that the datum qua datum will suffice to enable us to understand society; nor that we are to renounce analysis as a method of procedure. Analysis is the sole means by which thought can deal with its data qua data; but notwithstanding, to analyze social facts is not the whole task of social philosophy. To avoid the dangers of analysis we should constantly refer back to the concrete fact which is being analyzed, and recognize that the products of the analysis are wholly relative to this concrete fact. If we succeed in doing this, we shall limit the various appar- ent dualisms of social theory to the contexts in which they respectively make their appearance; and as a result, our disputations over these appar- ent dualisms will be not only more fruitful, but more conciliatory. PEARL LOUISE HUNTER. The Value of Religion. G. E. MOORE. Int. J. E., XII, I, pp. 8i-98. In order to decide whether it is good to believe in God, we must first decide whether God exists. If He does exist, we do well to believe in Him. After examining the various proofs and moral reasons for belief in God, the writer concludes that there is no evidence establishing the least probability either that God exists or yet that He does not exist. Even though our be- lief in God fails us, it is to be doubted whether we may not still retain the very elements which have rendered religion most effective for good in the past. They are in fact elements which have no logical connection with belief in God. First, there is that valuable element in religious emotion, which proceeds from the contemplation of what we think to be most truly and perfectly good. We are only entitled to think of this as what ought to be ; not as what is or will be. This emotion need not lose much of its force because its object is not real. The effects of literature show this to be true. It may be doubted whether the most effective part in all religious belief has not always been similar to that which we have in objects of imagination, a belief quite consistent with a firm conviction that they are not facts. And secondly, that some good objects should be real, is indeed</page><page sequence="12">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 91 necessary for our comfort. But these we have in plenty. It is better to give up the search for a God whose existence is undemonstrable, and divert the feelings toward those of our own kind who are worthy of all the affec- tions that we can feel; and whose help and sympathy are real. We might perhaps with advantage worship the real creature a little more, and his hypothetical creator a good deal less. G. W. T. WHITNEY. PersOilichkeit und Werk. Zu einer Theorie der Biograj5hie. EDWARD PLATZHOFF. Ar. f. sys. Ph., VII, 2, pp. 210-226. The importance of personality has always been recognized. It is the measure of the individual. A demand for personality at the present time means a struggle with the reigning intellectualism. There is a tendency to evaluate all mental events according to their conformity with the laws of logic or physics. On account of specialization, all spiritual community among men is disappearing. The inner life is sacrificed for the objective. The work is not a complete expression of the personality and one always attempts to penetrate behind it. In our time there are two correlative movements in support of the personality, the one pedagogical, the other historical. The pedagogical stands for the development of will and feeling. History and biography always take into consideration the person- ality, but the work is their best source-often the only source. The rare, the 'heroes,' the representatives of mankind' are the objects of his- torical investigation while the mass is left unconsidered. The encounter of a striving power with an opportunity, and the relation of the personality to the mass, both irrational factors, explain the extraordinary or remarkable of which history takes cognizance. The potentiality of the mass is actual- ized in the individual. Although our knowledge of personality is neces- sarily very incomplete, still light is thrown upon the understanding and value of a work by the traces of personality found in it, and by a knowledge of the conditions under which it was executed. C. M. STORY. HISTORICAL. Thomas v. Aquino und Kat : ein Kam,5f zweier Welten. RUDOLF EUCKEN. Kant-Studien, VI, I, pp. I-I8. The doctrines of Kant and Thomas Aquinas are so at variance with each other that it is impossible for a thoroughgoing follower of Aquinas to un- derstand the Kantian point of view. The main charge which the Thomists make against Kant is that his theory is mere subjectivism-that he substi- tutes a world of illusion for a world of reality, and that he identifies the moral standard with the arbitrary will of the individual. The real basis of this charge is the inability of the critics to conceive of a spiritual reality without a sensible ground. In his expositions, Kant does not always guard himself sufficiently against a subjectivistic interpretation, but in its essen- tial features his doctrine is anything but subjectivistic.</page><page sequence="13">92 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. The Aristotelian metaphysics is not fitted to furnish a permanent basis for philosophical investigation. It is too closely interwoven with Aristotle' s theories of natural science to be of service at the present time, if we take anything more than its bare outlines. Moreover, it is difficult to see how it can be harmonized with the doctrines of the Roman Church. Thomas Aquinas made a harmonization which was acceptable to the Middle Ages, but to-day it is far from satisfactory. For one who has read his Kant with any degree of understanding, a return to the Thomistic philosophy is im- possible, just as a slavish adherence to Kant's own doctrine is impossible. ELLEN BLISS TALBOT. Studien zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Fichtescien Wissenschaftslehre aus der Kantischen Phziosojihie. WILLY KABITZ. Kant-Studien, VI, 2, pp. 129-205. This article was the author's inaugural dissertation at the University of Berlin. After a brief discussion of the development of Fichte's thought previous to his acquaintance with Kant's writings, we have an outline of those features of the critical philosophy which are important for the purpose of the author. There follows a discussion of the way in which Fichte modi- fied and developed the critical philosophy before he may be said to have worked out a system of his own. As an appendix, we have a number of Fichte' s letters and fragments, which are here printed for the first time, and which are referred to, now and again, in the article. The writer calls in question the prevailing opinion that previous to his acquaintance with Kant, Fichte was greatly influenced by Spinoza. His acceptance of determinism (his main point of contact with Spinozism) may have been due rather to an acquaintance with the writings of Crusius. He was certainly influenced, however, by Lessing's contributions to the philosophy of religion, and by Rousseau's exaltation of practical over specu- lative interests. In his development of the critical philosophy, Fichte was guided by the thought of a principle which should furnish a common basis for the practical and theoretical aspects of consciousness. The ideal of human thinking is that it shall not be bound to a merely mechanical series of associations, such as constitutes the mental life of brutes, but that it shall be capable of self-direction. Freedom in thinking-and by this Fichte means, not freedom from law, but rather rational thinking-is the ideal for man. Similarly, in the moral realm the ideal is practical freedom, i. e., freedom from determination by the sensibility. Man is not completely free either in his thinking or in his willing, but he is to become free; the underlying principle of both thinking and willing is the ideal of freedom. The rationalistic tendency which is seen in Kant's theory of knowledge appears also in Fichte's. But, whereas Kant tries to deduce his a firiori elements of cognition from logical principles, Fichte seeks to establish them by the aid of psychological and metaphysical considerations. Reinhold's influence upon him shows itself rather in special points than in the general character of his philosophical system.

Kant showed the fallacy in the deduction of a metaphysical ego. He sought the determining principle of thinking in the formal laws of thought; but, unlike the rationalists, recognized that formal thought is empty and serves merely to organize an empirical material. His aim was to substitute a new method which he named ' criticism' for the skepticism of Hume and the dogmatism of Wolf. The main difficulty in understanding Kant lies in his terminology. 'Metaphysics' means first principles. The ' under- standing' represents logical functions; while ' reason' indicates the domain of abstractions and generalizations. A triori and a tosteriori should be understood in a logical sense. ' Transcendental' denotes the subjective conditions of experience, and ' transcendent' means beyond the ken of knowledge. If Anschauung is translated by ' intuition,' it should be defined as visualized perception. Kant regards notions of space and time as insuppressible, necessary, unique, and infinite. He believes that by conceiving the forms of sensibility and thought as purely ideal, the reality of the world is assured. Certain mystical ideas on space and time, which permeate religious thought, influenced both Kant and Swedenborg. The result is that Kant's statements show a certain resemblance to those of Swedenborg; but their agreement with the view of Leibniz is much closer. The theory of the ideality of space and time and the forms of thought rends asunder thought and reality. The weakness of the philosophy appears in the antinomies. They are in reality due to the equivocal significance of words, not to the fault of reason. But, granting Kant's premises, his con- clusion was justified. The points of the antinomies, that is, the eternity and divisibility of the world, the contrast of freedom to causation, and the existence of God, involve some notions of experience. Hence they cannot be decided by the method of pure reason, and other methods are, in his opinion, inadmissible. N. E. TRUMAN.</page></plain_text>
