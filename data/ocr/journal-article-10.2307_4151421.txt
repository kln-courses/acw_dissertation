<plain_text><page sequence="1">KAREN WILKIN The Biennial and Beyond "SCULPTURE IS THE ART OF THE PAST and photography is the art of the future," I learned recently from one of my favorite people, a perceptive polymath with a good eye for art. Once I stopped taking it as a personal affront-I've spent an inordinate amount of time thinking and writing about sculpture and organizing sculpture exhibitions-the idea pro- voked a host of questions. What was the art of the present? Where did painting fit in? Did it matter? Weren't the distinctions between disci- plines eroding these days, the way Academic categories dissolved in the mid-nineteenth century? The opening of the Whitney Biennial soon after this conversation offered a chance to test my friend's premise and the questions it raised -unreliably, of course, since the Biennial is, at best, a broad, shallow and, of necessity, hit-or-miss sampling of some of the past two years' most interesting work, according to a few curators whose judgment one may or may not trust. But allowing for its essentially capricious nature, the 2004 Biennial seemed to be one of the better ones. The usual "age- ism" prevailed-a concentration on artists of the curators' generation, with token acknowledgements of a few older practitioners, such as a wall of embarrassingly weak David Hockneys and a room of forgettable Mel Bochner "word paintings"-but there was much less aggressive political art or designed-to-disgust sociological commentary than in other recent Biennials. The videos seemed less intrusive and less raucous, and the installation was generally clearer and less jam-packed with disparate works. This Biennial was polite. The selection included quite of lot of work in three dimensions, suggesting that my friend's warning about sculpture's obsolescence was premature, but since most of it was dismal, he may have been right after all. Much of it paid homage to the idea of "l'informe"-anti-form: loosely-organized, elaborate accumulations of such now-expected materials as potholders, Mylar, vinyl, scavenged kitsch, and industrial debris, assembled with little regard for rigor or visual interest. Much of it was, a colleague complained, too "girly." Art and fashion seemed finally to have fused seamlessly in works that uncannily recalled Prada's spring line, with its floral prints, limp ruffles, and glitter. By contrast, Richard Prince's installation of deceptively straightforward grey wooden forms, transliterations of displaced front and rear car hoods, some with spoilers, all with surfaces weathered into chalky streaks, seemed like a masterwork of sculptural articulation.</page><page sequence="2">272 THE HUDSON REVIEW Painting and works on paper were, surprisingly and reassuringly, well represented, but they suffered from many of the same afflictions as sculpture-over-complication and an abundance of finicky dressmaker details. A few younger artists managed to make a virtue of the prevailing taste for complexity and fragility, without, interestingly, ever seeming to embrace the lyrical. Julie Mehretu's layered paintings-really enormous drawings-played subtly rendered architectural structures against intri- cate calligraphy or crisp-edged colored planes, while Amy Cutler's me- ticulously rendered feminist images, like wry riffs on Indian miniatures, had almost enough charm and invention to offset their predictable conception of the plight of women. James Siena's convoluted drawings, teetering on the brink of maniacal obsessiveness, were oddly engaging, although I preferred the "cooler" optical play of his elegant painting of interlocking "combs." A welcome respite from the general fussiness was provided by the "older master" Robert Mangold's trio of tall, econom- ical "column" paintings, their vertical fields animated by swoops of assured drawing. In another context, I'm not sure how I would respond to Olav Westphalen's black-and-white drawings of tigers, including the hapless Ming, recently rescued from captivity in a New York apartment; but amid all that self-conscious delicacy, it was a pleasure to come upon these lush, boisterous images. I imagine I was supposed to feel the same way about Cicely Brown's paintings of reclining female nudes, but I was immune to their dead color, inert surfaces, and flaccid, arbitrary refer- ences to the body. I confess indifference, too, to Amy Stillman's weirdly old-fashioned abstractions, which channel the dimmest efforts of the last generation of die-hard Abstract Expressionists, prettified and domesticated. Some of Elizabeth Peyton's carefully considered figures demanded that attention be paid, although I can think of any number of equally accomplished painters of her generation working in a similar manner. Did photography emerge as the art of the future in the 2004 Bien- nial? Certainly it was well represented. The oversized extravaganzas of the recent past were notably absent, but there was the usual roster of deadpan portraits, descendants of Diane Arbus and August Sander, updated by the use of color, raunchiness, and an often unpleasant knowingness. An exception was Emily Jacir's documentation of her performance of tasks dictated by Palestinians who, barred from travel, could not perform them themselves. Their requests ranged from paying a phone bill to eating a special dish, from visiting a grave to spending "a normal day," all in locations that the instigators could not return to or had never seen. Jacir's straightforward listing of each task, in English and Arabic, accompanied by an equally straightforward, evocative im- age relating to its execution, was deceptively simple, moving, and visually engaging. My friend's assertion of photography's growing significance seemed more convincing if you included video and film-discounting, however,</page><page sequence="3">KAREN WILKIN 273 their unconvincing use as animated painting, electronic phenomenon, or harangue, to concentrate on works that took full advantage of video's ability to suggest absorbing narratives through images and, sometimes, sound. Eve Sussman's meditation on what might have happened just before and after the moment suggested by Velazquez's Las Meninas was irresistible-no match for the real thing, of course, in terms of nuance and magical lighting, but visually rewarding and rich enough in inci- dent and half-heard mutterings to make you watch the loop several times, checking the peregrinations of courtiers, royals, children, mastiff, and dwarves (with the painter doggedly working away amidst it all) against your recollection of Velizquez's composition. Craigie Hors- field's poetic evocation of the Canary Islands and its culture was full of ravishing images and sounds: horses looming and disappearing in the fog, weathered faces, rain in a dimly lit forest, drummers and flute players, a religious procession. Like and unlike images on four screens were intelligently deployed to enhance a sense of place and event, but everything went on to exasperating length; the piece would benefit greatly from canny editing. I emerged from the 2004 Biennial still puzzled by my friend's pro- nouncement and, as usual, dubious about the selections. A few may prove memorable, many seemed questionable, and most, I suspect, will evaporate without a trace. The final word, perhaps, was that of a trans- gressively chic visitor with modish glasses to his transgressively chic female companion. "I can appreciate good art and bad art," he said, as they exited, "but I can't appreciate bullshit." No matter what you thought of the Whitney's choices this spring, there was a good deal of exciting and unpredictable recent work to be seen elsewhere. At Garth Clark's Long Island City space, the indefatiga- ble British giant Anthony Caro showed Pot Ladies, a series of rambunc- tious female nudes (and one male) collaged together from altered ceramic forms. They reminded us that at eighty, Caro continues to challenge himself and his viewers. Like most of his recent sculptures, the Pot Ladies seemed improvisatory and utterly assured, as though Caro were inventing the whole notion of sculpture, while drawing upon more than half a century of experience, simply by piling up randomly chosen pieces of material and trusting intuition and informed judgment to do the rest. I preferred the least literal of the series, such as a side-by-side duo of stacked "vase" forms bridged by a flat double-arched shape that shifted between bodily and still-life allusions. All of the figures were notable for their celebration of lived-in, weighty, no-longer-youthful humanity, perhaps most evidently in a marvelous Susanna and the Elders (2001-2003), with a heroine as meaty as a Rembrandt nude; the elders, reduced to slabby stoneware paws and schematic head-like forms, tried to climb a steel strut that both formed the fulcrum of the piece and held them at bay. Caro's early expressionist figures of the 1950s, with their urgent modeling and massive forms, seemed oppressed by gravity; the Pot</page><page sequence="4">274 THE HUDSON REVIEW Ladies, perhaps because of the tension between their voluptuous fleshiness and lively abstract structure, seem to accept and triumph over natural forces. As in the best of Caro's recent explorations of narrative and reference-which parallel his continued testing of the expressive possibilities of abstractness-the fascination of the series resides in the multiple reading it demands: everything from an intense awareness of figural allusions to an acknowledgement of remarkable freedom of structure. These apparently contradictory references, in turn, bring you back to the realm of the corporeal and the intellectual by reminding you of the power of creativity and of the eminently human act of making. Mia Westerlund Roosen's sexy, faintly comic, unnameable objects and intense, seductive drawings, at Lennon-Weinberg Gallery, offered a very different, wholly metaphorical idea of the bodily by conjuring up ideas of human and non-human fertility and growth. The sculptures translated the drawings' ambiguous "pods" into smooth lumps of the fine-grained concrete that is one of Westerlund Roosen's preferred mediums. The burgeoning forms seemed to gather themselves up as you watched, some raising themselves high above the floor, others remaining earth-bound and squat. Rows of slightly rough-hewn balls peered from beneath their skirts and emerged from ruffled folds, as though you were witnessing some stage of primitive reproduction; the balls threatened to break loose, roll free, and bud into more of the swollen "mother forms." One eccentric tight-pressed trio of spherical volumes on stubby legs exuded chopped cylindrical forms. For some time, Westerlund Roosen has been making large-scale works, both indoors and out, that replaced the notion of sculpture as object with that of sculpture as excavation, interruption, or insertion, always with rather uncanny sexual and anthropomorphic connotations. Her new work enlarges these themes in terms of self-contained forms that provoke a host of unlikely associations, from the elaborate wigs of the seventeenth century to massive animal paws to the reproductive processes of plants and marine life, without ever allowing you to ignore their existence as autonomous invented things. In Chelsea, Michael Mulhern's exhibition at Reeves Gallery and Kevin Wixted's at Lohin Geduld were evidence that eloquent, bold abstraction-as opposed to the Biennial's wispy effusions-is still alive and healthy. Mulhern's elusive paintings, both on canvas and paper, were continuations of his recent exploration of layering, concealment, and excavation as metaphors for lived experience and the construction of self. Subtly modulated expanses of dull, metallic, aluminum grey, applied with broad gestures, bury layers of wristy calligraphic marks, which survive mainly as memories but occasionally escape at the edges, haunt the thinnest passages, or are retrieved by scraping out. In the large works on paper, wrinkles add another kind of drawing, all relief and shadow. In Mulhern's most recent works, the underlying layers are a cinnabar red, rather like the protective coating applied to steel before it is painted. Emerging full strength in the narrow incisions of drawing,</page><page sequence="5">KAREN WILKIN 275 the red also tints some of the greys with almost imperceptible pinks, like the reflections of a setting or rising sun. Yet these rather romantic associations are overwhelmed by industrial ones, along with the inevi- table connections with wounds (among other things). These days, despite the gritty beauty of his pictures and despite their sensuous painterliness, Mulhern's blanketing greys have still other connotations for anyone who saw the smothering layers of grey debris in lower Manhattan after September 11--which includes the artist himself. Mulhern was forced to flee his home directly south of the World Trade Center site after witnessing the collapse of the South Tower from his studio windows, which shattered. (He and other tenants were able to return to their building only many months later after a long and ardu- ous cleanup.) The way the wrinkles in Mulhern's large paper works simultaneously function as drawing incidents and as records of a difficult history reinforces such connotations. Yet none of this explains or determines the power of Mulhern's recent paintings. That they are richly associative is undeniable, but it is their raw, physical "abstractness" that carries these associations, the nuances of color and surface, the shifts of gesture and line, and the adjustments of interval and density that engage your eye and allow, mysteriously, a wealth of wordless ideas to assert themselves. Wixted's hard-edged urban improvisations are no less mysterious, but for quite different reasons. Part of what makes them so compelling is the way they keep you trying to figure outjust how taut combinations of stripes, checks, and harlequin-lozenges are made to read as vivid evocations of architecture, at the same time that they flirt with the legacy of Cubist still life during its phase of wild embellishment. In the best of Wixted's recent pictures, color shifts are made to pry apart adja- cent patterned bars, turning them from flat painting events into articulated "towers." Color is used, too, to make checked and striped frontal rectangles retreat or slide off at angles, to suggest the complex space of densely packed buildings. Planes with rounded sides are forced by color or pattern to become surrogates for domes and cupolas. When this tonal and chromatic dynamism is absent, Wixted's densely packed compositions can seem a little claustrophobic, but in his most satisfying pictures, everything comes alive, often abetted by his sometimes allow- ing evidence of his hand to become visible, an assertion of the artist's presence and the reality of surface that further animates his fictive cityscapes. Memories of the striped cathedrals of Tuscan towns, the schematic geometric towns of early Renaissance paintings, and the New York skyline jostle for attention with the fact of cheerful, vernacular patterns. I preferred most of Wixted's larger pictures to his smaller efforts, probably because the larger were spatially complex and ambiguous, while the majority of the small paintings remained stubbornly two- dimensional. Most memorable, perhaps, were a horizontal picture of close packed, vaguely "sculptural" towers, keyed off a range of yellows,</page><page sequence="6">276 THE HUDSON REVIEW from creamy lemon to sand, sparked by off-greys and lavenders, and a narrow vertical canvas in which slender striped and checkered bars and rounded shapes in reds and greens pulsed against a luminous neutral ground, triggering recollections of campanili and minarets against a Mediterranean sky. Lohin Geduld is a new addition to Chelsea, with an interesting exhibition list that mixes established, mature painters such as Jay Milder with mid-career artists such as Wixted, plus a group of newcomers. If the gallery continues as it has begun, it should become an essential stop for anyone who cares about engaged, ambitious painting and sculpture. Uptown, at David McKee, Jake Berthot's intimate new works suggest- ed that the boundary between figuration and abstraction is not only permeable but probably not worth worrying about. Recently, Berthot has been making arresting images of a landscape defined by the vertical trunks of trees that are at once wholly personal and homages to Ce- zanne, at once rooted in perception and entirely unreal. In his paint- ings, Berthot's trees seem to struggle with the sheer density of pigment to assert their identities, like things glimpsed through peripheral vision, at night. In his drawings, Berthot's ruminations on the natural world threaten to revert to gatherings of taut, vertical strokes and pools of tone. In both, a firm geometric underpinning-or the memory of one -holds everything in place. Berthot's images seem clearly to be invented constructs, more a kind of ideal woodland "architecture" than an invocation of the forest, yet at the same time, they are powerfully evocative of a specific place. In fact, both interpretations are accurate. The tree paintings are both a deeply felt response to the landscape of the isolated, rugged part of Upstate New York where Berthot lives- which he has minimally altered to provide vistas that he finds stimu- lating-and the latest manifestation of his long fascination with the contradictions between the brute existence of pigment or line on a surface and the mystery of illusion. An earlier, disquieting series, for example, made you ponder how a centralized oval or shield shape, floating in a sea of dense, luminous strokes, could read so powerfully but non-literally as "head." The recent landscapes similarly pulse be- tween straightforward "treeness" and diagrammatic drawing as a medi- tation on ideal archetypes. Cool reason, rational construction, and unbridled romanticism seem to be locked in a passionate, evenly matched debate in these pictures, with no one emerging as a clear winner. In one group of small, fierce paintings at McKee, however, romanticism dominated. Dark, brooding, almost ungraspable, the series set notes of brilliant orange-gold against deep brown expanses of crusty pigment. The placement and general shape of these glowing incidents, along with almost imperceptible inflections in the surrounding field, turned them into moons or camp- fires, in the best tradition of the nineteenth century-think Ryder or Blakelock, or for sheer density, certain Courbets, distilled and trans- formed into contemporary, near-abstract terms. While the nineteenth-</page><page sequence="7">KAREN WILKIN 277 century associations were reinforced by the small, horizontal format of Berthot's canvases, they also seemed to have affinities with more recent aspects of the American sublime-Clyfford Still perhaps. But ultimately, these strange and unforgettable pictures remained entirely, stubbornly Berthot's own. Earlier in the season, a very different response to the natural world was constructed over a period of weeks in Williamsburg's Parker's Box Gallery by Matt Blackwell and John Bjerklie, a pair of inventive mixed- media artists who have known each other for more than two decades. They share a taste for the worn, the weathered, and the haphazard, and an appetite for the absurd. Both make hard-to-classify work that sets (sometimes autonomous) three-dimensional constructions in painted or drawn or collaged settings. At Parker's Box, Bjerklie's massive, cobbled-together "money-tree," which seemed about to burst the con- fines of the space or at least fill it completely, became a sheltering point for Blackwell's wonky creatures-most memorably, a disreputable, charming bear made of scavenged metal. Slapdash but convincing landscape elements, fragments of urban debris (some real, some lov- ingly reconstituted), and the occasional reference to the artist's practice in viewing and depicting the natural world somehow combined to create an amiable free-for-all held together by astute visual choices and thoughtful placement. All this and fun, too. I wish I understood the rationale for adding a series of diptychs by the young Andrew James to the lively installation achieved by the two independent-minded sculptors, apart from the fact that James, like Bjerklie and Blackwell, is a Brooklyn resident. His contribution? Pairing his own works with the amateur efforts of his mother, with one canvas sometimes inverted. I'm probably showing my age by declaring that I missed the point. I'd rather have seen more Bjerklie or Blackwell, but that, as my father used to say, is what makes horse racing-or gallery going.</page></plain_text>
