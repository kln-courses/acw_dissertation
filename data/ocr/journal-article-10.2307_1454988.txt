Excavations at Tell Qasile, Part One: The Philistine Sanctuary: Architecture and Cult Objects (Qedem 12) (Jerusalem, 1980), the first volume of this report, reintroduced the site, recounted the history of its discovery and excavation, detailed its strati- graphic problems, and compared the results of the new excavations in "Area C" with those of Benjamin Mazar, who excavated in "Area A" from 1949 to 1951 and in 1956 (see Part I, p. 6, fig. 3, and p. 76, fig. 7 for maps showing the positions of both areas on the tell). Part I also describes the evolution of the early Iron Age sanctuary as well as a late Iron Age occupational phase, stratum by stratum, the cult objects from the sanctuary by type (anthropomorphic vessels, masks, stands, bowls, libation vessels, and other varia), and makes inter- and intrasite comparisons of the architecture of the various buildings discovered on the site. This tell also happens to have the only "Sea Peoples" sanctuary ever excavated in Israel and is the only early Iron Age port in the region. In Part II Mazar deals with the pottery and small finds from "Area C", draws historical conclusions, and attaches six archaeometric appendices. While reading the second volume of the report, one must have the first volume immediately at hand in order to follow the author's text and arguments and to refer to the relevant plans and maps, the lists of loci by stratum, and the photographs of some of the cult objects published in Part II only as drawings. Mazar's major conclusions, introduced in Part I and argued forcefully and successfully in Part II, are drawn from an analysis of Tell Qasile's cultural remains and an explanation of their eclectic nature. The settlement seems to have been, from an architectural point of view, local Levantine. The dominant local culture, descendant from the Canaanite, has a significant Philistine ingredient, with elements that can be traced best to Cyprus and the Aegean, but also has connections with Syria, Phoenicia, and Egypt. Since the Qasile cultural assemblage seems to be later than that which characterizes the era of Sea Peoples' (read: Philistine) migration and settlement into the region in the early twelfth century BCE, the tell was probably settled during a period of Philistine expansion from already established centers to the south. Thus Philistine Qasile was founded in the * Amihai Mazar. Excavations at Tell Qasile, Part Two: The Philistine Sanc- tuary: Various Finds, the Pottery, Conclusions, Appendixes.

Mazar's promised article, "The Emergence of the Philistine Material Culture" appeared in IEJ 35 [1985]: 95-107, and reviews the arguments from a broader perspective). The results of the methods used to study the pottery and small finds support these conclusions. Each small find has been thoroughly researched. In fact, in most cases, to study Mazar's descriptions and interpretations is to read a short paper on the individual genre to which the item belongs: for example, "An Iron Knife with Ivory Handle" has its connections to the Aegean and to Syria (pp. 6-8) and "A Bird-Shaped Cosmetic Box" is tied to its Egyptian antecedents (pp. 10-12). The analyses are exhaustive, the references abundant. The pottery is introduced by an explanation of the methods used in its collec- tion and analysis (pp. 21-24). A strategy was developed in which all rims, a sample of handles and bases, all decorated body sherds, and all storable vessels from each locus were saved. After all possible restoration was completed, a type- series (seriation) of the recorded pottery was developed, based on profiles and assisted by the many restored pots. The pottery was further described for the computer record: in addition to find-place and type, clay color, core type, in- clusions, slip, burnish, and decoration (the last three include the location of the surface treatment on the sherd) were noted. Using these methods, quantitative analysis could be attempted and lists of the quantities of each vessel-type in each locus could be published in a special catalogue (pp. 152-60). Eventually this type of data will lead to inter- and intrasite comparisons of the economies of individual settlements and the nature of their populations. It should become de rigeur in the archaeology of Israel to approach site data in this way. Pottery drawings are arranged in the figures by locus and stratum and then by type within each stratum. Sketch maps of the temples of Strata XII-X (figures 7-9, pp. 24-28) and building 225 of Stratum X (fig. 10, p. 30) locate the find- places of the individual vessels and identify types. This is an excellent idea that might be expanded in future publications of other parts of this and other ex- cavations. Field drawings of the vessels in situ could enhance the graphic picture, but these sketches depict placement, concentration, and quantity simply and successfully. The chapters that describe the pottery (18-20) do so by type. In the Tell Qiri report M. Hunt published a set of drawings of the Iron Age vessels by type. These drawings served as logical companions, easily found and followed, to the discus- sion of the typology of each type (A. Ben-Tor and Y. Portugali, Tell Qiri: A Village in the Jezreel Valley [Qedem 20] [Jerusalem, 1987], pp. 139 ff.). The pottery of Qiri was also published by stratum. Since A. Mazar's analyses differ somewhat from those of T. Dothan's now standard reference tool and typology of Philistine pottery (The Philistines and Their Material Culture [New Haven, 1981]) to which Mazar often refers, a set of drawings to illustrate the development and categorization of each vessel type (Philistine and non-Philistine, etc.) over time, in</page><page sequence="3">MAZAR'S EXCAVATIONS AT TELL QASILE, II-PALEY 413 addition to those by locus and stratum, would have eased the burden of so much page-turning and would have made the chronological development of each type, so carefully explained in the text, more easily understood and more readily usable. Such is the case when one uses the Qiri report. Despite this technical difficulty, one can still gain an appreciation of the fact that at Tell Qasile there are Philistine and non-Philistine wares, non-Philistine wares with Philistine-style decoration and vice versa, and local wares with Phoe- nician decoration-that is, evidence of a sharing of styles and motifs by various workshops in the eastern Mediterranean. There are also a few imports from some of these places, as well as from "inland." The bulk of the pottery is, however, local. Table 11 (p. 105) shows graphically that in Strata XII-X, the percentages of excavated pottery weigh heavily in favor of non-Philistine wares. Thus in the final analysis the pottery is a most persuasive argument for the eclectic nature of Philistine culture as it is represented at Tell Qasile. Some remarks should be made about the archaeometric appendices. A. Rosen's brick and sediment analyses (pp. 133-37) should now be read with her compara- tive data from Lachish, Batash, and Miqne, conveniently summarized in Arlene Miller Rosen, Cities of Clay: The Geoarchaeology of Tells (Chicago, 1986), pp. 75-114. There is some confusion in the Qasile report and in her subsequent publications, including Cities of Clay, concerning locus numbers. This may be due to further work at the tell not recorded in these publications. This confusion is further complicated by the fact that in her Qasile report the samples of analyzed brick and sediment are not identified with specific strata but with rough dates by century. One must go hunting for the specific stratum in Part I. This is not impossible. Brick samples were taken from Temple 319 (Stratum XII), Shrine 300 (Stratum XI), Building 225 (Stratum X), Building 147, Wall 615 (Stratum XI), and a building with a number 330 or 335. These two numbers seem to refer to the same place, although there is no Building 330 or 335 in the rest of the report. There is a room 330 which was identified as possibly part of a public building, perhaps part of Building 147 (see Part I, p. 30). Is Building 335 an unpublished edifice or a new temple, if the analyses of the sediments from room 330 (sic!) which suggest cultic activity are correct? Or is this a typographical error for something else which has been repeated in more than one publication? Should it be room 330 of Building 147 (Stratum XI)? The technology used for the manufacture of the bricks was the same for all those analyzed except for the bricks of Buildings 330/5(!) and 147-perhaps another indication that 330/ 5(!) and 147 are the same building. Some bricks were stronger than others. Two brick collapses were analyzed, one from Shrine 300 and another from Wall 615 (both from Stratum XI); these bricks were internally weak. Brick strength can be measured by the amount of sand in the admixture: the more sand, the weaker the brick. This seems to be the case here. Floor sediments were sampled from Building 330/335(!) and Courtyard 110 (Stratum XII). Courtyard 110 showed evidence of domestic activity; building 330/ 335(!) of cultic activity. No other conclusions were drawn, nor was there any</page><page sequence="4">414 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW comment on how these findings correlated with the material culture recovered from those places. We are also left with questions concerning what other informa- tion might have been derived from the analyses besides the technological one: the relationships between brick size, composition, arrangement, and chronology, for example. Paul Goldberg's analyses of the brick and sediment morphology (pp. 137-39) adds the information that the plaster and bricks were all made from local materials despite the technology. M. E. Kislev's and M. Hopf's contribution (pp. 140-45) centers on the discus- sion of grass pea and dwarf chickling, two of the five species of plant foods discovered at the site. Since no systematic paleobotanical sampling seems to have been undertaken, Kislev and Hopf describe the seed remains in evidence-includ- ing barley, darnel, and horsebean as well-and then trace the history and use of the pea and dwarf chickling, pointing to the fact that these two food sources have been used historically in times of food shortage since they are hardy plants which survive drought conditions. They bring abundant ethnological data. No historical or archaeological conclusions could be drawn without more samples from various loci and from more than one stratum. However, an important suggestion is made which should be picked up by paleopathologists: the toxic effect (the disease is called neurolathyrism) of eating the pea and chickling in quantity (one-third to one-half of a human's diet) over time (three to six months) might be evident on skeletal remains from archaeological contexts. One would expect a report on knapped stone tools if there were paleobotanical remains, but there is none. In general, the overall quality of the graphics in this publication is good, and there are only a few editorial mishaps. For example, some numbers are missing on Figure 55 (10, 11, 13, 16, 22, and 24). Figure 56 has a set of numbers in a different typeface, as if someone ran out of the pressapply numbers used up until that point, but Figure 57 is back to the original typeface. Small things, perhaps caused by the final rush to the press. Also, an index would have been useful because of the detailed information in the description of the artifacts. All in all, the volume is well presented and well argued and must now be used as a basic reference tool for further work on the Philistines. State University of New York, Buffalo SAMUEL M.
