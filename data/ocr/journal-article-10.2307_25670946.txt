Arkansas Archaeological Survey, Popular Series 5, Fayetteville, 2005 136 pp., 70 figures. $10.00 (pa per, ISBN 1-56349-99-4). Reviewed by Carol Diaz-Granados, Depart ment of Anthropology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri Rock Art in Arkansas is a small and very af fordable book that introduces anyone (especially the general public) to the status of rock art studies in that state. This book is an "easy read" at 131 pages. The inclusion of color photos of rock art, landscape scenes, maps, people working in the field, and artifacts, add to its appeal. George Sabo's forward elucidates the need for this book on Arkansas rock art and admits to a lack of printed information on the topic for general audiences. This book fills that need. Although not a compre hensive panorama, the book's nine chapters admi rably cover a variety of topics ? a few in-depth. Chapter 1. What is rock art and what can it tell us, by Sabo and Sabo, elucidates its subject heading. Were one to list the basic questions fac ing an individual wanting to study a body of rock art, the questions posed would certainly cover it. These questions follow the usual journalistic in quiries: what, why, when, where, who, how, etc. - a good way to begin. Chapter 2. The history of rock art research in Arkansas, by G. Sabo and Hilliard, is an excellent overview and discussion of rock art recording in the state beginning in 1883 and working up to the present. It includes a concise look at sites re searched in what became Arkansas's first state park in the Petit Jean Mountains. The reason for the park's importance is in large part attributed to its rock art coupled with the work of the early ama teur archaeologists who recorded and studied those sites. This chapter lays heavy on the work of Fritz and Ray (1982) which began in 1978. Fritz and Ray recorded and discussed 46 sites in their re port. Hilliard's extensive work on Arkansas rock art is also given attention, particularly his work at The Narrows site, which links material remains to the rock art (elaborated in Ch. 7). Chapter 2 also notes the Arkansas Archaeological Survey's website that "contains articles, a picture gallery, a searchable data base, and special sections for school-aged children with interactive learning ac tivities and lesson plans to help teachers use the website. . ." (p. 34). Chapter 3. Who made it and how old is it, by George Sabo, elaborates on the prehistoric aspect of those who lived in the Arkansas region and cre ated the rock art there. It overviews the prehis toric time periods and makes some comparisons to cultural materials containing iconography simi lar to that found in the rock art. A brief discussion of graffiti at rock art sites is included. Chapter 4. Rock art in the cultural landscape, by Hilliard, Sabo, and Sabo, addresses the contex tual aspect of Arkansas rock art. Here the authors are attempting to understand the rock art's place in the cultural landscape and its relationship to other archaeological sites in the region. They speculate about the choice of placement of rock art on vari ous formations and by previous researchers. The authors propose further subdivisions that contain distinctive stylistic properties. They anticipate still further stylistic divisions as more work is com pleted. They touch on the potential of predictabil ity regarding the placement of rock art in specific locations, which they refer to with the term "deci sion matrix." Chapter 5. The Petit Jean Painted Style, by Michelle Berg-Vogel, offers an excellent synopsis of this style. She enters into a discourse on the definition and purpose of "style analysis" and then delves into the Petit Jean Painted style character istics. Again, the more recent work there has re fined the definition of this style.

She notes a consider able variety in the Petit Jean Painted style. Ulti mately, Berg-Vogel states that this chapter "pro vides the most comprehensive published statement on the Petit Jean Painted style" to date (p. 65). Chapter 6. Paddlefish and fish trap pictographs at Rockhouse Cave, by Berg-Vogel, covers one of the most important rock art sites in the state. In the Central Arkansas River Valley, this site "con tains at least 105 rock art images, making it also one of the most complex rock art sites in Arkan sas" (p. 72). Berg-Vogel discusses the presence of both the paddlefish image and a possible (or probable) fish trap in close association. The paddlefish image is one of only four zoomorphic figures" at Rockhouse Cave, and one of only seven so far recorded on Petit Jean Mountain" (p. 73). Chapter 7. The Narrows Site, by Hilliard, con centrates on another of the state's most significant rock art sites. The importance of The Narrows site, originally recorded in 1934, stems from its associ ated artifacts that include pigment-stained stone fragments, abrading tools, and worn hematite frag ments in Stratum 3. Very few rock art sites in the eastern United States have such well documented associated artifacts. A portion of this site "was radiocarbon dated to about A.D. 1435" (p. 81). The site is also exceptional because of its abundance of anthropomorphic figures. Chapter 8. A plethora of images, by G. Sabo, begins with an overview of identifiable motifs and then explores those that are geometric and abstract. He first looks at anthropomorphic motifs, the larg est array being at The Narrows site. Associated motifs include two hand and seven foot petroglyphs and are the only ones of this type currently known. Most of the anthropomorphs appear in stylized form, whereas animal depictions are usually ren dered naturalistically. The animal depictions in clude mammals, birds (rare), fish, turtles, and snakes (plentiful). Sabo also touches on compos ite creatures, plant forms, and celestial images. He remarks that "Sunburst images occur in all parts of Arkansas where rock art is found" (p. 109). Sabo goes on to review geometric forms followed by a discussion of abstract figures. Chapter 9. Preserving our rock art heritage, by G. Sabo, closes the book with a broad discus sion about conservation issues, the diversity of motifs, site types, and styles, as well as dating con siderations and problems with weathering and van dalism. He ends this chapter with guidelines (a listing of "do's" and "don'ts") to follow when vis iting a rock art site. Glossary. What is there is good, but a number of additional terms could have been included such as "petroglyph" and "pictograph" and a couple dozen other terms, although they are defined in the body of the text. The glossary is stated as being admittedly brief. However, as a book di rected primarily toward the general public, it would certainly add to the reader's benefit to have all the pertinent terms in one place. I disagree with some of the terms and their definitions, but this is not unusual among those doing rock art research. A standard terminology has yet to be developed. In summary, Rock Art in Arkansas is an ex cellent way for anyone, general public or profes sional archaeologists, to get a handle on the basics of the prehistoric images and on-going research in this state. Although a fine contribution to the lit erature, it just begins to address the tremendous amount of rock art research that has been going on in Arkansas over the past couple of decades. With the increasing interest in rock art research and rock art's inherent value regarding the iconography in its motifs and panels, this book is a welcome addi tion to the literature. However, there is no ques tion that the Arkansas Archaeology Survey's three year NEH grant will result in a much larger, in depth coverage and analysis of Arkansas's rock art, and I am among the many who will be looking forward to that subsequent publication.</page></plain_text>
