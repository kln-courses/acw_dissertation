Eppinger National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. Dept. of Transportation OBJECTIVES The primaiy goal of this effort was to demon- strate the feasibility of predicting three experi- mentally observed measures of head/brain injury severity as a function of kinematic parameters. The problem was to show that it is possible to predict automobile crash-induced head and brain injuries based soely on the accelerations experi- enced by the head due to impact. Demonstration of the feasibility of predicting head/brain injuries from kinematic parameters, and interpretation of the kinematic parameters most informative of injury mechanisms as shown by the models, may lead to more relaxed design specifications for anthropomorphic surrogates. That is, showing a predictive link between exter- nally mounted skull accelerometer responses and head and brain injury means that only the dynamics of the head-neck system need to be accurately mimicked; there is no need to attempt designing an artificial brain. A key factor of this demonstration project was to show that the Adaptronics Adaptive Learning Network (ALN) modeling methodology could pro- duce empirically-derived predictive models posses- sing the requisite accuracy. Thus, the overall project goal was to demonstrate jointly that kine- matic waveforms indeed contained information relating to head and brain injuries, and that non- linear ALN models could properly exploit this information. (A more detailed project document is the final technical report given in Ref*- enee (7). *) PROJECT ORGANIZATION This project was conducted in the manner * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT* An analysis of experimental head impact data was preformed to demonstrate: (1) that kinematic waveforms contain information relating to head and brain injuries; and (2) that analysis techniques exist which can properly exploit this information to create injury predictive functions. An experimental data base consisting of 26 monkey head impacts was utilized. Translational and rotational acceleration time histories of the head were available. Parameters computed from these kinematic waveforms were the input vari- ables to an analysis technique. The output, or modeled, variable was the experimentalises evaluation of the severity of injuries. The results of the analysis are presented and it is concluded that it is possible to accurately model head and brain injury assessments from strictly head motion parameters . Subsequent analysis of the derived predictive functions reveals interesting insight into the relationship between the kinematic parameters and head injury and sug- gests potential strategies for he^d injury mitigation. * The research presented here was funded by the Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, under Contract No. DOT-HS-4-00882.

This program produced three types of output: 1) translational and rotational head accelerations and velocities (in three orthogonal directions), 2) visual observations of animal post-impact behavior, and 3) pathology reports. The HSRI- generated outputs were the inputs to this project. Three head/brain injury predictive models were created in this project as functions of the provided kinematic waveforms. It should be emphasized at this point that all data supplied by HSRI (12) was accepted at face value. The reader is referred to that work for any desired elucidating details of experimental techniques, instrumentation, and/or pathology and injury grading. The success (or failure) of this effort was contingent upon several factors: 1) that there is truly a relationship between response and injury, 2) that both of these measures were captured ade- quately in the experimental environment, and 3) that the modeling methodology employed has the capability of extracting or constructing meaningful relationships between the responses and the injury rating. Any inaccuracies, non- truths in the data, or insufficient analysis capabilities could individ- ually or in combination contribute to the outright failure or general degradation of performance of the desired functional relationships. Also, any successful result, in view of all the potential pitfalls, lends credence to the hypothesis under conjecture and some merit to the internal consistency of the experimental data since any functions obtained are relationships between various opinions and observations of the refer- ence experimentalist and not necessarily a reflec- tion of "the absolute truth". EXPERIMENTAL DATA The digitized experimental data Used in this investigation consisted of a variety of amplitude versus time waveforms, as well as impact test summaries, from a series of head injury experi- ments conducted on monkeys by the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) (12). The time wave- forms used in this project were component angular and translational velocities and accelerations. Basic data gathered during the head impact experiment consisted of readings from accelero- meters mounted on the monkey T s head. The accelerometer traces were processed to provide velocity and position data concerning head motion. The component angular and translational velocities and accelerations were the source for the kinematic parameters used.

The impact summaries recorded the test condi- tions, animal characteristics, post-impact state of the animal, and the pathologists report. The values for the brain injury indices were either extracted or computed from information contained in the summary forms. The weight of the test animal and its mean head radius were obtained from the same source. The last two items were used in scaling and parameterization of the time waveforms. Key information obtained from the impact summary forms is summarized in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Table 2 illustrates the five major categories of head injury observed in the 26 experiments. There are comparatively few ex- amples of injuries in all five categories. It was noted that 10 experiments did not show head in- juries of any type.

The latter time was recorded via visual observation of the animal's behavior utilizing eye blink reflex and general muscle tonus. The values for uncon- sciousness duration were very subjective. In fact, three of the 23 experiments had the statement ". . . still unconscious after xx minutes. . recorded. For these cases, the last value given was used for modeling purposes. Rather than use the integer value assigned to AIS for model synthesis purposes, a computed Overall AIS was obtained from the observed impact injuries and their associated AIS values. The Overall AIS was computed according to the follow- ing equation (11): 3 1/3 AISQ = I (AIS.) (1) AIS. was the component injury AIS, and AISq was the computed Overall AIS. The computed AIS values represented a smoother function to be modeled than the unit step function of the assigned AIS. The assigned AIS was equivalent to the com- puted value rounded to an integer value with an up- per limit of six. There was, of course, good correlation between the computed and assigned AIS values. HSRI provided 13 types of time waveforms for each head impact experiment. The waveforms are listed in Table 4; those employed in the study are designated by an asterisk. Kinematic constraints limited the usage of waveforms to angular and trans- lational accelerations and velocities. These wave- forms were approximately 6 to 12 ms in duration and represented the motion of the animal's head during and immediately following impact. Accel- eration and velocity waveforms were provided in component form with the three body fixed axes oriented as shown in Fig. 2. As discussed above, the predictive models were synthesized using only parameters obtainable from a configuration of head-mounted accelero- meters. Since each of the 26 impacts was directed to either the side or back of the head, the x,y,z acceleration components were not used individually because there were insufficient data in each mode to detect the possibility of directional bias, Instead, the instantaneous resultant was computed and used. Also, the waveforms were taken in a reference frame derived from anatomical landmarks. All waveforms except the translational velocities were taken in this anatomical frame. Since resultant waveforms were computed, the inertial and ana- tomical reference systems were equivalent for waveform parameter computations. WAVEFORM PREPROCESSING Preprocessing steps consisted of computing resultants from components, scaling of resultants to normalize monkey mass, and deriving the two resultant "jerk" waveforms from component accelerations. Jerk waveforms were first-order approximations of the time derivatives of accelera- tion waveforms; that is, the third derivatives of displacement. Preprocessing resulted in six waveforms which were the source of all input parameters to the in- jury models: Angular and translational jerk, accel- eration, and velocity resultants were designated as 6,0,0, andx,x,x, respectively. Instantaneous resultants of the component velo- city waveforms were computed as: r(t.) = d^)2 + v(t.)2 + w(t.)2 (2) where r(t.) represented the resultant velocity at time t. and ů, v, and w were the component veloci- ties at time t..

N. MUCCIARDI, ET AL. waveforms were computed using the same equation. Velocity, acceleration, and jerk were designated by single, double, or triple differentiation marks. Plots of the six scaled resultants for three of the experiments are presented in Appendix A. (The complete set can be found in (7)). Two jerk waveforms (angular and translational) were derived for each experiment by taking the re- sultant of the component third derivatives. For example, the u-component instantaneous jerk was computed by: ü(t.) - ü(t.-l) u(V = 1 At 1 (t. = 1, . . . , N) (3) The time interval, At, was equal to the reciprocal of the sampling frequency*. The three component jerks were used to compute the resultant jerk via Eq. 2. Resultant waveforms were scaled to compen- sate for animal mass variations by assuming material properties (specifically Young's Modulus, E, and density, p) remained constant (8)). A scal- ing constant, X., for the i^ experiment was deter- mined as: V (Ä) where M was the mean mass of the 26 monkeys and m. was the mass of the monkey used in the i**1 experiment. The scaling factors applied to the various waveform and time variables have been included in Table 5. Both scaled and unsealed data were employed with approximately equal success. The scaled data were used because the experimental points mapped into a more compact space; that is, the waveform parameters exhibited smaller variances about their means after scaling. * Sampling frequencies of either 16 kHz or 27 kHz were used to digitize the acceleration waveforms (12). WAVEFORM PARAMETERIZATION Waveform parameterization enabled properties of the resultants to be reduced to a set of para- meters, or "features. " The set of 34 parameters derived from the six resultants provided a sum- mary of the kinematic description of the head im- pact experiments. The parameters used to syn- thesize the predictive models have been listed in Table 6. Twenty-six parameters, 1-13 and 15 - 27, were derived from resultant waveforms; the souce waveform was designated by 0, 0, 0, x,x, or x. Waveform maxima, time of maxima, and RMS values of each resultant were also computed. Additionally, the waveform variance, normalized area under the curve, and first moments were calculated for the resultant accelerations. In general, these parameters provided gross measures of the magnitudes involved in each impact as well as the shape of the head motion waveform. Parameters 14 and 28 are the time differences between occurrences of maximum velocities and maximum accelerations for angular and transla- tional motions, respectively. These two parameters were considered useful for distinguishing padded from unpadded impact experiments. Two time window parameters, A^(0) and At^ (x), were selected for possibly distinguishing the type of impact. The width of each window is equal to the time for which the acceleration wave- form exceeded one-half of the sum of the RMS and maximum values. That is, for translational acceleration, M = 1/2 [ RMS(x) + Max(x)] (5) and the waveform was searched, beginning at t=0, for the first value of time for which x(t) &gt; M. After this time point (tļ) was found, the waveform was searched for 4 consecutive values of x(t), t &gt; t^, which were all less than M. (Four points were arbitrarily chosen so that a few fluctuations would not influence the window determination. ) Table 5 - Scale Factors of Time and Resultant Waveforms Type n^h Time Derivative Parameter Oth 1st 2nd 3rd -1 -2 Translational, x X None X X -1 -2 -3 Rotational, 0 None XXX Time, t X None N/A N/A</page><page sequence="7">BRAIN INJURY MEASURES 3 1 77 Table 6 = Kinematic Parameter List Parameter Number Designation Source Waveform 1 Max (è) Angular Acceleration 2 ^max Angular Acceleration 3 RMS (0) Angular Acceleration 4 RMS (0) Angular Acceleration ® (0) Angular Acceleration 6 Sg (¿) Angular Acceleration 7 a2 (0) Angular Acceleration 8 Max (0) Angular Velocity ® ^max Angular Velocity 10 RMS (0) Angular Velocity 11 Max C6) Angular Jerk 12 ^max Angular Jerk 13 RMS (0) Angular Jerk l^ At (8,0) Angular Velocity &amp; Acceleration 1® Max ( X) Translat ional Acceleration I® *max Translational Acceleration 1"^ RMS (x) Translat ional Acceleration 1® RMS-1 (x) Translational Acceleration 10 (x) Translational Acceleration 20 Sg (x) Translational Acceleration 21 &lt;j2 (x) Translational Acceleration 22 Max (x) Translational Velocity 23 *max Translational Velocity 24 RMS (x) Translational Velocity 25 Max (x) Translational Jerk 2® ^max Translational Jerk 27 RMS (x) Translational Jerk 28 At (x,x) Translational Velocity and Acceleration 29 ûthp (0) Angular Acceleration 30 Äthp Translational Acceleration 31 KE/TE- Angular &amp; Translational Velocity 32 KE/TE^ Angular &amp; Translational Velocity 33 te¿/TEa Angular &amp; Translational Velocity 34 kMax(0)/Max(x) Angular &amp; Translational Accélérât ion tmax = Time of occurrence of maximum RMS = Jz(a.)27N RMS"1 = 1/RMS 1 T S, (a) - £ 1 / a( t )dt 1 o l T S2&lt;a&gt; = ŠTŪĪT a2 * E ^i-1)2 N-l At(0,Ö)= t maxv (Ó) ' - t (Ö) ' maxv ' - maxv ' '2-12 The first of these 4 time points was labeled t . Then, Athp(X) = t2~tl (6) which is the time during which the waveform ex- ceeds the approximate one-half power value. It was thought that large t values for these four para- meters would be associated with padded impacts. The remaining parameters, 31 - 34, indicated the proportion of motion attributable to the angular and translational components. The ratios of total energy to translational energy at times of maximum angular and translational velocities were repre- sented by parameters 31 and 32, respectively. Angular energy was approximated by idealizing the animal* s head as a uniformly dense sphere of radius r.. The pair of angular and translational velocities at the times of maximum angular velo- city and maximum translational velocity were used to compute parameters 31 and 32 according to: /.2 2-2 ' / x + (0.4)r. e ' KE/TE = ' - - I (7) Parameter 33 was defined as the ratio of 31 : 32. The last parameter was the ratio of torque to force as indicated by the resultants. Again, the animal's head was idealized as a sphere of uniform density with radius r.. The ratio was computed as: k Max (e )/Max (x) (8) where, 2 k = (0. 4)r. (9) NONLINEAR PREDICTIVE MODELS Three brain injury variables were modeled nonlinearly in this study. As described previously, the modeled variables were: (1) the Overall AIS, (2) Unconsciousness AIS, and (3) Time of Uncon- sciousness. The multitude of component AIS values which resulted in a single Overall AIS, and the combina- tions of unconsciousness times and degrees of un- consciousness which resulted in the same Uncon- sciousness AIS, suggested that these variables could be modeled most appropriately by nonlinear combinations of the kinematic input parameters. Polynomial Adaptive Learning Networks (ALNs) are especially useful for the modeling of such com- plex processes. More details of such processes are presented in (1, 3, 4, 6). A summary is given in Appendix B. Each of the three brain injury indicators was modeled as a (multivariate) polynomial function of the kinematic parameter inputs. Since only a small amount of data was available to develop and evaluate the predictive models, and the method of developing the models required the use of three subsets of data, the use of a clustering algorithm (5) was necessitated to assure a good representation of the data in each subset. The resulting distribution of data points into the three subsets is indicated in Table 7. The dis- tribution shown in the table was used to develop the Overall AIS model. The three experiments, Points 4, 7, and 10, in which the animals were expired or expiring prior to the impact test, were eliminated from the respective data subsets for synthesis of the Unconsciousness AIS and Time of Unconscious- ness models. Thus 23 data points were used to synthesize these two models.</page><page sequence="8">3178 a. n. mucciardi, et al.

The third subset was completely withheld from the modeling process and used subsequently to test the ability of each model to predict injuries on new data. All input variables were normalized by sub- tracting the mean value and dividing by the standard deviation. The next three sections will describe, in turn, the form, performance and interpretation of each of*the three predictive models. OVERALL AIS MODEL Predictive Model - The ALN procedure chose seven of the thirty-four available kinematic para- meters for utilization in the Overall AIS predictive model. This ALN polynomial network structure is shown in Fig. 3. The coefficients for each two- input, single-output element appear under the structure schematic. The parameters RMS(x), Max(x), and RMS-l(x) were selected repeatedly tò model the Overall AIS variable. Model Results - The Overall AIS results are shown in Fig. 4. The dotted 45-deg line passing through the origin represents 100% prediction accuracy. The four-layered ALN implements an (incomplete) 16th order polynomial in the seven inputs. The value of the coefficients, as well as their nonlinear interaction, causes many of the terms in this equation to contribute little to the model output. Since Overall AIS values were assigned as integers between 0 and 6 inclusive, the square regions about each AIS value were included to indicate correct mapping of real values to integers by rounding. Eighty-five percent prediction accu- racy was achieved by the seven-variable model (Fig. 3). The average absolute error and the average absolute percent error of the model for all 26 experiments were 0. 34 and 10. 2%, respec- tively.

It can be seen that Overall AIS varied proportionately to RMS(x) and was inversely proportional to the RMS *(x) parameter. Kinetically, these parameters were descriptive of the translational momentum (both mean and maximum) and the average rate of change of translational momentum. The results suggested the hypothesis that greater momentum transfer and rate of momentum transfer contribute to higher Overall AIS. UNCONSCIOUSNESS AIS Predictive Model - The Unconsciousness AIS Model was a function of six kinematic parameters. The ALN polynomial network structure is shown in Fig. 6. The most informative kinematic para- meters were RMS(x), Max(x), and S2(6). The two- layered ALN implements a fourth degree polynomial in the inputs.

Although the RMS transla- tional velocity was an important factor to Uncon- sciousness AIS, the model also indicated that early introduction of maximum angular accelera- tion in addition to the magnitude of maximum trans- lational acceleration contributed to high AIS Unconsciousness values. TIME OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS Predictive Model - The Time of Unconscious- ness model was a function of seven kinematic parameters. The ALN polynomial is shown in Fig. 9. The two-layered ALN implements a fourth degree polynomial in the inputs. Unlike the preceding two models, the sensitive parameters kMax(0)/Max(x), Max(x), and RMS(x) did not appear more frequently than the remaining parameters. The parameter occurring most frequently in the model was S (0). This parameter was highly A correlated with S (x); the correlation coefficient A being 0. 88. The network structure suggests that these parameters may have been used for scaling the input data in order to cope with the very wide range of unconsciousness times. Model Results - The predicted times versus observed times are plotted in Fig. 10. The average absolute error for all 23 experimental points of the data base was 10. 9 min. In the plot, regions denoting 10-min increments of unconsciousness times have been included. The regions are cen- tered around 5, 15, 25 min, etc. Using these arbitrary regions to measure the model accuracy resulted in a 44% correct performance. However, the average absolute error value was reasonable considering that very coarse, 15-min increments were used to differentiate, subjectively, uncon- sciousness AIS values (assigned by HSRI). Discussion - The Time of Unconsciousness model was most sensitive to the three parameters kMax(0)/Max(x), Max(x), and RMS(x). The values of these parameters generally increased with increasing times of unconsciousness as shown in Fig. 11. The ratio parameter, kMax(0)/Max(x), indicated that higher angular acceleration relative to translational acceleration resulted in longer unconsciousness times. Higher values of the translational jerk also contributed to the longer times of unconsciousness. SUMMARY OF PREDICTIVE MODELS - The modeled Overall AIS measure was dependent primarily on translational velocity and accelera- tion. The model sensitivity analysis indicated that Overall AIS was a function of the total momen- tum transferred from the impact and the rate at which momentum was transferred to the head. The RMS(x) parameter was a significant para- meter in all three models.

Comparison of these with results from the Overall AIS model suggested that angular motion may be a prominent factor in causing unconscious- ness. Angular motion as a major probable cause of unconsciousness was supported by the structure of the Time of Unconsciousness model. Close examination of its most sensitive parameter, kMax( ë)/Max(x), showed that increased components of angular motion relative to translational motion produced longer periods of unconsciousness. TRANSLATIONAL VERSUS ANGULAR MOTION AS CONTROLLING FACTORS IN BRAIN INJURY DISCUSSION - The effects of translational versus rotational motion on subsequent brain injury were studied. Ideally, an experimental device could be constructed to produce one type of motion independent of the other to separate fully the effects of these two components. In this study, a gross estimate was made of the contributions of both com- ponents in the following manner. The 2 6 -member experimental data base con- sisted of recorded accelerations, reduced to resul- tants, as well as derived velocity and jerk wave- forms. Kinematic parameters were derived from these waveforms and were functions of both trans- lational (X) and angular (0) motions. Any change in a particular waveform will alter some, or all, of the parameters obtained from that waveform. For instance, if a new experiment produced twice the X levels in the same time period as compared to a previous experiment, the Max(x) parameter would be twice as large in the new experiment. In fact, all parameters associated with amplitude levels would be altered. However, the time of maximum x would not be altered. The predicted Overall AIS would change since the model is sensi- tive to amplitude -type parameters. Therefore, amplitude changes in either or both of the translation and rotation waveform families will physically cause the injury levels to change as well as the levels predicted by the three respec- tive models. Thus, if amplitude levels are changed in a systematic manner, the effects of each compo- nent of motion on brain injury can be studied with the aid of the three predictive models. To accomplish this, a 'lumped" parameter was defined for each component of motion and de- noted kx and kQ , respectively. The parameter kx was configured to be one overall estimate of the effects of varying the amplitude of translational motion; and, similarly, k0 for angular motion amplitude changes. The idea was to proceed as follows. Since injury, I, was a function of both translational and angular parameters l = f(x,0) both parameter types would be amplitude-perturbed to simulate hypothetical experiments. The effect of such perturbations was that x' = k x x and ef = k0e so that I changed to I' = f(x', 0f). The change in I-level, AI = I - I', can then be related to the magnitude of the respective perturbations to x and</page><page sequence="13">BRAIN INJURY MEASURES 3 1 83 0 because k X and kQ are (by definition) known. That is: X li ~ l'v 9x k -1 X k0 = 1 and il ~ i-r 96 k -1 k = 1 e x This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 12. COMPUTATION OF LUMPED TRANSLATIONAL AND ANGULAR PARAMETERS - Three experiments were chosen from the 26-member data base to rep- resent "typical" low-, mid-, arid high-injury accel- eration levels, respectively. The prototypical experiments were those that were closest to the centroid of the three cluster cells that contained the low-, mid-, and high-injury experiments (7). The points were Experiments 3, 20, and 24. A set of hypothetical experimental data was obtained from each point by assuming that the prototype experiment had been repeated with either larger or smaller resultant accelerations recorded. That is, the "recorded" translational and angular accelerations were the amplitude-perturbed accel- erations as described above: x'(t) =k x(t) (10. a) and ëT(t) =k0 0(t) (10. b) Thus, acceleration values of the hypothetical data were either amplified or attenuated versions or the actual values, depending upon whether the k' s were greater or less than unity. Notice that neither the waveform shape nor time duration are altered via Eq. 10 - only the amplitude. All of the kinematic parameters (Table 6) were obtained from the acceleration waveform as a start- ing point. Consequently, modification of this wave- form could potentially cause all of the 34 parameters to change - hence the term "lumped" parameter has been chosen to denote the two kTs. Since the hypothetical experiments were de- signed as alterations in waveform amplitude but not shape - that is, maxima remain at the same location - parameters depending on time were not affected. The same is true of the normalized shape parameters, S . The manner in which the 34 para- rá meters were altered via Eq. 10 is shown in Table 8. An illustrative example of the generation of the kinematic parameters obtained from a hypothetical experiment was constructed by considering the Overall AIS model (Fig. 3). It used only seven of the 34 kinematic parameters as seen in the figure. The values of those seven variables that would be obtained from a hypothetical experiment were obtained as: ( HEAD ļ I IMPACT J RECORDED ACCELERATIONS Translational : (x, , x, ,xk) Rotational1 {&amp;tĄ,6k) COMPUTE RESULTANTS x(rt=^/xf(t) + xfd) txïm óftHvVft) *ä'(D*e,1» "Ia "k PERTURB WAVEFORMS jft)-k,xw Ö'(i)= k8Ô(t) A (k.»l) (k.&lt;l) k'«) / ' ílt) Lk / ' ílt) A 1 COMPUTE WAVEFORM PARAMETERS (TABLE 6) Original Experiment Perturbed Experiment x,3 x' e' ESTIMATE INJURY LEVEL i=f(x,e) I'sfix'.e') i I.

It is interesting to note (Table 8) the number of variables per injury model affected by either or both of the amplitude-perturbing lumped para- meters. These are given in Table 9. CONTOUR PLOTS - The interactive effects of translational and angular motion were estimated by varying k and k about unity and thereby obtain- X 0 ing a predicted injury level for each perturbed input. The locus of points on the K^k^ plane pro- ducing constant levels of (predicted) injury yielded a contour plot. The iso-injury contours were ex- amined to obtain the desired estimate of relative effects of X and 0 on injury. Separate contour plots were obtained from the low-, mid-, and high-injury prototypical experi- ments for each predictive injury model. Two of the models - Overall AIS and Time of Unconscious- ness - were chosen for this purpose. The values of k and kA ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 0 in steps of X e 0. 1. That is, attenuations as much as 90 percent (k = 0. 1) and amplifications as large as 100 per- cent (k = 2. 0) were used. Therefore, 400 total hypothetical experiments (20 kx values times 20 k0 values) were generated via Eq. 11 per injury level per model. It is not to be expected that all possible k ,k X Ö combinations in this range would yield kinematic parameter values that would be observed under actual experimental conditions. To establish feas- ible bounds for each contour plot about the k = k a X a ü = 1 center point, each of the 400 points generated about a given prototype point was tested to see if it fell within the cluster cell for which the prototype point was its (approximate) centro id. It was be- lieved that all hypothetical points meeting this constraint could be physically observed because other actual experiments fell within this range. The admissible ranges of kx,k0 values found in this manner are shown in the contour plots of Figs. 13 and 14 by the dashed-line enclosures. EFFECTS OF IMPACT DURATION - Because the Overall AIS was nearly insensitive to angular amplitude charges (Fig. 13), it was decided to study alterations in the duration of the impact. In this case, hypothetical experiments were gen- erated in which both the translational acceleration amplitude and time were perturbed by the constants k and k , respectively. The constant k was the X t , X same as used above; the constant k^. either shortened (k &lt; 1) or lengthened (k &gt; 1) the time during which t t the acceleration was observed. Although k^ has no effect on the amplitude of the acceleration curve, it will affect the amplitude of the velocity curve because it is the time-integral of the acceleration curve and, hence, time dependent. That is, xT (t) = x(t)Ať = x(t)(kAt) = k[x(t)At] because the time be- tween samples, At, has been changed to kAt. Thus, kg was replaced by k^ for the Overall AIS model, and Fig. 13 was reconstructed as a k^ versus kx contour plane. (It is interesting to note that the two parameter k versus k curve is similar t X in concept to the "Wayne State Tolerance Curve," (2).)

Since k0 was not being considered, it had no influence at all. The velo- city waveform was affected by perturbations of the acceleration duration due to the integration process. The procedure for generating Figs. 13 and 14 - illustrated in Fig. 12 - was repeated for kx and k^; the results are shown in Fig. 15. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS - The following comments are based on the results of the analysis of the 26 H SRI impact tests. The contours of constant AIS values were ob- tained by rounding all predicted values to the near- est integer. The Overall AIS model (Fig. 13) is a fairly smooth function in the region of the three cells; the predicted Values ranged from 0-9. It can be seen that the available experimental data suggest that Overall AIS was primarily dependent on translational motion and was relatively insensi- tive to angular motion. The contours in Fig. 14 represent minutes of unconsciousness as predicted by the relevant model. The modeled variable ranged from 0 - 120 min. The Time of Unconsciousness contours showed a stronger dependence on angular motion than in the Overall AIS case. The effect of varying angular amplitude on the duration of unconsciousness - at a given translational amplitude in the low- and mid-injury cells - appeared to increase uncon- sciousness time up to a local maximum value and then to decrease unconsciousness time. The conclusions drawn from the contour plots of Fig. 14 are that the unconsciousness duration was dependent on both translational and rotational</page><page sequence="17">BRAIN INJURY MEASURES 3 1 87 i 1 2 0 1 O 1 2 kx kx kx Low Injury Cell Mid Injury Coll High Injury Cell Legend k - Translat ional Acceleration Scale Constant X kt - Time Scale Constant - Denotes Range of Experimental Tests Fig. 15 - Predicted contours of constant Overall AIS as a function of translational acceleration amplitude and duration perturbations components. There appeared to be an interaction between these two components of motion relative to this brain injury measure. It can be seen in Fig. 15 that both amplitude and duration of translational accelerations affect the Overall AIS, and in nearly equal ways. In fact, the shape of these contours are strikingly similar to the above-cited Wayne State Tolerance Curve. CONCLUDING REMARKS The root mean square translational velocity, RMS(x), was found to be a very informative des- criptor of head injury (such as, fractures) and brain inury (such as, hematomas, unconscious- ness). All three measures of severity reflected a strong dependence on this parameter. The other main parameter selected by the Overall AIS model, in addition to the RMS(x) para- meter, was the Max(x) parameter. Physically, these parameters were descriptive of the average and maximum momentum transferred to the ani- mal's head. The results showed that greater momentum transfer contributed to high AIS values. The two parameters found to be important for predicting Unconsciousness AIS were RMS(x) and Max(x). These parameters indicated that high average translational velocity and large maximum translational acceleration contributed to Uncon- sciousness AIS. The two parameters found important in pre- dicting the Time of Unconsciousness, were the maximum translational jerk, Max(x), and the ratio of maximum angular to maximum translational acceleration. Inspection of this ratio parameter showed that as more angular motion was introduced relative to translational motion, longer times of unconsciousness resulted, and were predicted by the model. The parameter Max(x) indicated that high rates of change of translational acceleration also contributed to the duration of unconsciousness. In summary, the modeling exercises showed that the first and second time derivatives of trans- lational position were most informative of Overall AIS levels. Injuries considered in the Overall AIS were usually the result of physical contact of the head with the impactor. The first, second, and third time derivatives of translational motion as well as rotational accel- eration were most informative of unconsciousness duration. Both unconsciousness predictive models showed a strong dependence on the presence of angular components of motion. Thus, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to model accurately brain injury measures from strictly kinematic parameters using ALN models. It should be emphasized again that the experiments upon which this analysis was based were not designed to provide the quantity and quality of data required to obtain far-reaching conclusions. Hence one should exercise caution in any attempts to extrapolate conclusions toward practical applica- tion at this time. REFERENCES 1. R. L.

That is, the investigator attempts to interrelate all pertinent physical laws thought to influence injury. The problem with the analytical approach to modeling is that many physi- cal processes are so very complex as to defy rea- soning from first principles. Constructing a mathematical model necessarily requires a number of approximations about the relationship of one variable to another. If the guesses are wrong, the model proves to be inaccurate. Furthermore, the model may become quite cumbersome due to a large number of coupled equations, so that the computer processing time increases to unacceptable amounts. Empirical predictive methods involve finding a predictive equation that best fits the observed experimental data. But, with conventional empirical modeling methods, one still has to know which interrelationships are important in order to write the general terms of the equation. And the resultant models, like analytical ones, are inflex- ible. If unanticipated changes occur in the process, the models become obsolete. A different approach introduced by Adaptronics incorporates "self-learning" principles. To con- struct a self-learning model, the analyst first decides what variables may be important, but it is not necessary to consider the effects of the vari- ables upon one another. What is needed instead is a collection of data that is reasonably representa- tive of the variety of situations that can occur in the system being modeled. The next step is to construct a mathematical network, known as an Adaptive Learning Network (ALN), which is a nonlinear hyper surf ace linking inputs to output. A generalized equation is con- structed to link an output value to each possible pair of input variables. Special purpose computer programs are used to find the coefficients (the weights assigned to the variables) for each equation that makes it best fit the data. Those equations and variables that consistently produce the smallest prediction errors are determined. Additional equa- tions are then constructed that examine interactions among four, eight, or more variables instead of only two. These additional equations result in added layers in the network and are retained if they can improve the prediction accuracy. A model in the form of a network that has had its coefficients determined and has been reduced to the essential variables is called "adaptively trained". The synthesis of this model has pro- ceeded directly from examination of an experi- mental data base without human intervention; hence the term "self -learning". To make certain that the model has indeed discovered for itself the pertinent physical laws, additional experimental data not used in the training, or synthesis, phase are introduced to test the ability of the model to generalize on its prior experience in dealing with new situations. FORM OF ALN MODELS - The methodology associated with ALN synthesis is described more fully in References 1, 3, 4, and 6 by Barron and Mucciardi. In summary, two-input one-output "elements" are used to construct an adaptive learn- ing network. The output of each element, y, is a quadratic function of its two inputs x. and x.: 2 2 y 3 = w + W.X. + W_X. + W0X.X. + W.X. + W_X. y 3 w o W.X. li 2 j W0X.X. 3 i j 4 i 5 j All combinations of inputs are considered two-at-a- time as above. For given identities of x. and x^, an optimization algorithm is used to find the coeffi- cients, w, that yield the smallest error in fitting y to the values of x. and x. in a "fitting" subset of the i J data. Those combinations of variables yielding a</page><page sequence="21">BRAIN INJURY MEASURES 3191 low error rate (on an independent "selection" sub- set of the data) are then retained and the rest dis- carded. Thus, the candidate input list is pruned to the most informative subset. This produces the first layer in the ALN. The outputs of Layer 1 become inputs to Layer 2 and the process is now repeated. Since each input to Layer 2 is a function of two xfs, we are now considering functions of functions; thus the complexity of the model increases, but more slowly than its functional power. Only'those com- binations from Layer 1 are retained that produce the greatest improvement in accuracy. Now the outputs from Layer 2 become inputs to Layer 3, and so on. The training procedure is terminated when it is established that the addition of further layers would produce an "overfitting" condition; that is, the model would become so adept at fitting the data used to train it that it would be unable to generalize to data not previously seen. Special algorithms are used to detect and avoid this condi- tion. An ALN model thereby assumes the form of a multinomial - a polynomial in many variables - of the (automatically) selected inputs. The extent and type of non-linearities in model structure can be discovered and implemented during model syn- thesis. Thus, the ALN methodology is a powerful tool for use in data modeling instances where little or no knowledge exists regarding the functional relationship of dependent to independent variables.</page></plain_text>
