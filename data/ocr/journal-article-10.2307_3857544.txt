<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION Jane Collier Abstract: The aim of this paper is to create a framework which can serve as a guide to the understanding of organizational ethicality.' This is done by linking ethical and organizational theory. Organizational ethicality is about "being" as well as "doing": relevant ethical theory is therefore both substantive (agent-centred, concerned with the "good") as well as procedural (act-centred, concerned with the "right" in the sense of the moral or just thing to do). The ethical theories of Alasdair Maclntyre and urgen Habermas, as representatives of these two traditions, are mapped onto a framework which characterises organizations as assemblages of practices supported by a climate embedded within an organizational culture. Organizational practice is articulated and given meaning within a discourse of "sensemaking" in which narrative creates space- time links between people and events. Within that same communicative climate practices are evaluated and decisions taken. This theoretical framework is specified in such a way as to highlight the parallels with the ethical theories of Maclntyre, who uses notions of practice, tradition and the narrative unity of moral experience to create an ethical theory of the "good," and Habermas, who spells out the process of moral argumentation by which consensus on the " just" or "right" is reached. Some possibilities for further research are suggested at the end of the paper. 1. INTRODUCTION (i) Business ethics: the state of the art The business ethics "enterprise" is now well established both academically l and in terms of corporate involvement. Much has been achieved there are endowed chairs in universities, professional and practitioner journals taught courses in business schools and elsewhere, and a substantial body of literature and student texts. But the significance of all this activity is lessened by the discernible "theory-practice" gap in the subject which diminishes the ';user friendliness" of academic research (Collier l995a) and is ultimately responsible for the failure of the "academy" to make a significant contribution to "society" in terms of real-world ethical practice in organizations (Robertson 1993, @)1998. Bllsiness Ethics Qllarterly, Volume 8, Issue 4. ISSN 1052-1SOX. pp. 62 1 -654</page><page sequence="2">622 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY DeGeorge 1991). This presents a particular problem for organizations which aspire to "be" ethical, and to be perceived in the outside world as ethical (Industrial Society 1996a). Such organizations need to be able to conceptualise the idea of organizational "ethicality" so as to locate the practical and processual whereabouts of the "ethical" within the organization. This is a difficult task, because real "ethicality" runs deeper than ethical programmes, codes or guidelines. Ethics have to be part of the organization's bloodstream, not some kind of add-on. They have to permeate all policies, procedures and standards. (Clive Wright, Senior Consultant, ARCO Chemical Europe. [Industrial Society 1996a: 21].) For organizations as well as individuals, ethicality is located in the interaction between being, doing and becoming. The challenge for organizations is to translate that simple insight into organizational processes and practices. The challenge for academic business ethics is to provide the conceptual tools which will allow them to do this. (ii) Origins of the problem It is possible to identify three intellectual and philosophical reasons for the problematic state of the business ethics enterprise. The first of these is the theoretical "one-sidedness" of academic business ethics. Philosophical ethics talks about the "moral agent", but assumes that the moral agent is a person. Ethics as a discipline has developed over the centuries with autonomous persons in mind. It has always worked with implicit notions of human purpose, freedom, obligation, happiness. It has, so to speak, contained its own understandings of its object, its own "theory of the person." If business ethics is to work with and through the "collective" as object it requires an analogous theoretical understanding of "business" in other words, it needs to be integrated with an articulated theory of organization as moral agent. The development of a theoretical framework which combines the "organizational" with the "ethical" would serve two purposes: it would provide a heuristic which would enable the business community to evaluate their own practices, and it would give the business ethics "academy" a coherent theoretical framework which draws on the insights of existing organizational, philosophical and sociological theory, but yet is sufficiently grounded in practice to support meaningful theory-practice interchange. The second problem issue arises from the self-understanding of business eth- ics as a field in "applied ethics" (Winkler &amp; Coombs 1993). "Applied ethics" is generally taken to refer to the use of philosophical ethical theory and methods to analyse moral problems in various spheres of activity, but this "theory-practice" distinction makes little sense. Philosophers since Socrates have always reflected on moral problems without making any distinction between ethical theory and its applications, since ethics is by definition already "applied" in its conception. There is a difference of content in the discourses of theoretical and applied ethics, but there is strictly speaking none in method. The origin of this notion of i'applied</page><page sequence="3">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 623 ethics" as a separate branch of ethics can be found in the particular view of ethical theory held by contemporary Western philosophy. That view can be summed up in three premises. The first is that there can be objective rational agreement on general and universally applicable principles of morality. The sec- ond is that these principles can be formulated at a level of abstraction which ignores the socio-cultural, institutional, historical or situational context. The third is that universalizable moral principles can co-exist with a plurality of views as to how the "good" might be defined in terms of human aspirations (MacIntyre 1984). The logical next step is then to argue that "applied ethics" is nothing other than the application of universalistic moral principles to various spheres of social and political life. But application of universal moral principles to everyday practice presents problems. In the first place, there is disagreement among philosophers not only about the rational justification of rules of morality, but even about the actual content of those rules. This means that when it comes to "applying" moral prin- ciples in particular social and institutional contexts philosophical ethics can offer little or no guidance. What, for instance, should dictate the choice between the application of rival moral theories in practical business situations? In "role-play" classroom situations, where actual moral judgement is not required, the problem does not present itself as acutely as it does in everyday business practice. One of the features of textbook business ethics, as opposed to the "practical wisdom" required in day-to-day decision taking in business, is that business ethics deals as it were retrospectively with moral issues in business. Moral dilemmas are presented in teaching situations as case studies, they are frequently investigated by empirical researchers, but in both cases moral judgement by researchers and students is hypothetical in the sense that it is never made operational. But in real-life business situations judgements have to be made on the spot, and for businessmen who have to make quick decisions which have wide-ranging moral implications it is of little help to be told by an ethicist what a Kantian or a Utili- tarian or a Rawlsian would do in those particular circumstances. The interminability of rule-based moral debate is compounded by the com- plexity of real-world situations and the moral dilemmas they pose. Adherence to rules understood as universally binding, even if there were prior agreement on their applicability, can yield no moral recommendation in situations where obli- gations conflict-on the contrary, such adherence fosters the establishment and maintenance of entrenched positions best illustrated by the "standoff' nature of contemporary moral debates such as that on the issue of euthanasia. The expla- nation for the failure of moral rules to solve practical moral problems lies in the fundamental misconception at the heart of the ruling philosophical paradigm, viz. that it is possible to formulate and apply moral principles in a context-independent fashion. Ideas such as "duty," or "welfare" cannot be interpreted as abstractions: they rely for their meaning on the social, cultural and historical context in which they are expressed. Furthermore, the application of the moral rules to which these interpretations give rise is always situation-dependent, always conditioned by the</page><page sequence="4">BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY 624 "facts" of the case. It is in the very nature of moral reflection and the process of moral judgement in any society that rules are formulated and interpreted in a dialectical process between the changing nature and range of their practical ap- plication and the rules themselves. It is in that dialectic, both retrospectively as past moral judgements are evaluated, and prospectively as current options are con- sidered, that the conditioning of moral rules happens and moral judgements are made. Moral rules, in other words, are not timeless and ahistorical. Moral theory is embedded in the practices and relationships of a given society, and morality is expressed in socially conditioned ways. This does not mean that moral rules are relativistic, but it does mean that they must be reinterpreted and reformulated according to changing social perceptions of what the "good" means for particu- lar communities at particular times (MacIntyre 1984:506). The consequence is that act-centred rule-based ethical theory presents problems of application in every sphere of life, not merely in the organizational context. If "business eth- ics" is to make any contribution to ethical business practice it must find ways of dealing with this issue, otherwise the intractable difficulty of applying univer- salistic moral principles to complex organizational practice will in the end weaken the argument for the relevance of ethics to business. The third problematic feature of the business ethics enterprise is, so to speak, internal to itself. Three decades of academic endeavour has produced real schol- arship, well-developed frameworks of thought, valuable heuristics. What it has not produced is a Kuhnian-style "overarching paradigm" as a governing prin- ciple for business ethics "puzzle solving." The sociological basis of Kuhn's paradigm exists in that there is a community of scholars which shares a common desire to clarify and foster the basis of ethics in business, but a paradigm in the sense of an operational theoretical construct does not exist: it is questionable whether even multiple competing paradigms can be identified. And yet it should be possible to use the insights of the disciplines on which business ethics draws to create a theoretical framework which would at least have sufficient explanatory power to generate further theoretical conjectures and useful empirical applications. (iii) The wayforward I have argued that the underlying reasons for the divide between the business ethics "academy" and "society" are that academic business ethics lacks a theo- retical understanding of the organization as collective moral agent,2 that its usefulness is obscured by the problems of universalistic act-centred ethics, and that its internal coherence requires a multi-disciplinary "paradigm" which will theorise not only the ethical but also the organizational. If we accept that the primary task of the academic business ethics enterprise is not so much the retro- spective or prospective evaluation of business action on the basis of universalistic moral principles, but rather the provision of frameworks by which business can monitor and evaluate its own ethical stance, two initiatives are necessary in or- der to make this possible. The first of these is a shift in perspective from an</page><page sequence="5">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 625 "act-centred" to an "agent-centred" view of ethical theory. Act-centred ethical theories judge the morality of actions on the basis of differing criteria deonto- logical theories take as basic judgements about the "rightness" of actions, utilitarian theories judge on the basis of the desirability of action outcomes. Agent- centred ethical theory, on the other hand, is concerned with the nature, attributes and potential of the moral agent.3 This is a shift of emphasis consistent with common-sense understandings of morality. Ethical practice is not purely behavioural, not simply located in action, it is also rooted in the purposes, judge- ments and conscience of the moral agent. To look only at outcomes, as act-centred ethical theory does, is to neglect reasons for action, and thereby to miss a dimen- sion of moral existence which is as important in the collective as it is in the personal context.4 Theory-practice relationships ETECAL lUltORY \ \ ORGANIZATION problem of \ lHltORY \ philosophical \ \ ethics \ \ \ problem of \ t \ organizational \ ETHICAL PRACTICE \ research \ \ \ \ problem of \ problemofbusiness \ \ organizations X ethics researchers \ \ ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICE Figure 1 The second initiative involves a foundational "rapprochement' between ethi- cal theory and organization theory. Figure 1 contextualises this possibility within a generalized theory-practice framework. Existing problem areas are identified: the academic community faces the ongoing task of applying ethical theory to organizational practice, organizations face difficulties in applying ethical prac- tice in everyday organizational practice. Both of these problems "sit" within a nexus of relevant disciplinary theory-practice relationships. However, they are</page><page sequence="6">BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY 626 also located within the theoretical perspectives of philosophical ethics and orga- nization theory. The lack of a connecting thread between these creates a gap which needs to be filled if the above-mentioned concerns are to be properly addressed. Theoretical understandings of the ethical organization and self-un- derstandings of organizations seeking to be ethical both need to be grounded in a conceptual framework which links ethical and organizational theory. The rest of this paper is devoted to the construction of such a framework. 11. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS A theory of the ethical organization must be crafted from existing theoretical positions in both philosophical ethics and organization theory. But in order to link ethical theory and organization theory legitimately certain conditions have to be fulfilled. The first of these relates to commensurability. Within the organizational literature there is an ongoing debate on the question of paradigm pluralism and the necessity of multi-paradigm inquiry. Opposed organizational paradigms are frequently held to be incommensurable: their protagonists are seen to live in different worlds, use different vocabularies, hold mutually exclusive beliefs (Burrell &amp; Morgan 1979, Weaver &amp; Gioia 1994).5 If the issue of commensurability is important in organization theory, it is even more significant in a cross-disciplinary context. Commensurability is in the first instance about the underlying presuppositions on which paradigmatic positions are grounded. These presuppositions are both epistemological and ontological. In epistemological or "scientific" terms we can characterise theories in two dimensions. The first of these measures the degree to which paradigms are positivist/"hard" or interpretative/"soft. This spectrum relates to "how" theories are constructed. The second dimension relates to the function of theories the continuum between explanatory and predictive/interventionist purposes (Tsoukas 1993). The requirement for epistemological commensurability is that there is a reasonable "match" between the characteristics of the different theoretical constructs along the two dimensions. Figure 2 plots these dimensions and suggests locations for the conceptual building blocks used in this paper. Bridge building between disciplines also requires that theories be grounded in similar ontologies (Astley &amp; Van de Ven 1983). Ethical theory which is agent- centred can work together with organizational theorising which gives primacy to agency rather than structure, which is voluntarist as opposed to determinist, and which recognises the significance of meanings rather than causes. The loca- tion of the ethical within organizations demands agency-based practice-, process- and policy-based theoretical constructs which are holistic and context-sensitive as opposed to individualistic. This kind of organization theorising in turn de- mands ethical theories which are practice-based, which give full weight to the creation and narration of meaning and to the context within which meaning is created, and which acknowledge the complexity of organizational decision taking.</page><page sequence="7">- - THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 627 | THE STATUS OF THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS l Explanatoly § Organizataonal Organ iza1ion al sensemaking as climatc . . narrative Organlzatlonal culture Algorithmic Heuristic/ interpretative analytic Orggizational MacInlyre's Haberml;/s theory Practice-based discourse ethics organization theory Interventionist Figure 2 The second legitimacy condition relates to the question of "fit," or concep- tual coherence between the disciplinary constructs. Concepts used in one theoretical context must be congruent with those used in the other (Ventrakaman 1989). Underlying theoretical assumptions about meanings, functions and rela- tionships between concepts have to be consistent. For the purposes of this exercise, two further dimensions of "fit" reveal ways in which synergy can be created by bringing together theoretical perspectives from different disciplines. The first of these relates to the "connectivity" of the analytical framework- "the ability of a new theory to bridge the gap between two or more different theories, thus explaining something between the domains of previous theories. In this way new knowledge is created.... the approach does not subsume the two, but instead incorporates selected elements from each" (Bacharach 1989:511). Similarly, theoretical "bridge building" can be "transformational" to the extent that it causes existing theories to be re-evaluated, or given new meaning and usefulness, as a consequence of new theoretical connections. A theory of organi- zational ethics crafted from existing ethical and organization theories can be shown to demonstrate both connectivity and transformational capacity, because it can generate new meanings and insights which, although independent of ei- ther discipline, can strengthen and enrich both.6</page><page sequence="8">628 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY 111. THEORISING ORGANIZATIONS (i) Organization as practice Organization theory is characterised by paradigm diversity and a multiplicity of competing theoretical perspectives which offer various ontological options (Willmott 1990, Morgan 1990). This diversity has superseded the unity in earlier interpretations which tended to present organization theory as a single general framework capable of explaining empirical phenomena and thus generating "objective" knowledge (Pugh 1966). Organizations are variously conceptualised as patterned social systems (Elliott 1980), as "negotiated orders" (Strauss 1978), as structures of power and domination (Clegg 1989), as symbolic constructs (Smircich 1983). In this instance, where the focus of interest is the "ethical" in organizations, the choice of appropriate organization theory is structured by the need to tread a fine line between deterministic accounts which "write out" the agent, and individualistic accounts which neglect the importance of context. However, a theory of organization which supports an analysis of collective moral agency must give primacy to agency as an essential organizing principle. This implies that views on organization which are primarily systemic, structural or cultural must be rejected for the purpose of this argument. The only theoretical perspective on organizations which can disclose and locate the ethical is one which views organizations as assemblages of practices, because the idea of "practice" privileges the aspect of agency in organizations (Reed 1985, 1992, Harris 1980). The validity of using the concept of practice to theorise a social system is definitively supported by the work of Anthony Giddens (1976, 1979,1984), who maintains that "the basic domain of study . . . is neither the experiment of the individual actor, nor the existence of any form of societal totality, but social practices ordered across space and time" (Giddens 1984:2). Giddens's "theory of structuration" replaces the dualisms of social theory structure/agency, society/ individual, objectivism/subjectivism, reality/concept with an agency-structure "duality" within which social life is recursively constituted in social practices. Social worlds are reproduced and transformed by social "practitioners" using the appropriate procedures and techniques ("rules"), as well as material and sym- bolic resources. Rules and resources constitute the generative, or potentiating, structure which both enables and constrains social practice: as structural proper- ties they are "both the medium and the outcome of the practices they recursively organize" (Giddens 1984:ix). The structures of practice have no existence inde- pendently of the knowledge, conscious and tacit, that actors have which is generated on a day-to-day basis by their skills and capabilities. "It is the specifi- cally reflexive form of the knowledgeability of human agents which is most deeply implicated in the recursive ordering of social practices" (Giddens 1984:3). Structures influence, but do not determine, action: their operation is dependent</page><page sequence="9">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 629 on actors' motivations, as well as on the way in which they rationalise, reflect on and revise their actions in the light of the intended and unintended consequences of what they do. This whole process constitutes "structurations' - the production and reproduction of social systems, as relations of interdependence between in- dividuals and groups, by means of the application of generative rules and resources. Agency, as the power to "make a difference" to social process on both the individual and the collective level, is at the core of this process. Giddens's theory of structuration sees social practice as a duality where agency and structure have equal significance. The legitimacy of theorising organiza- tions as "multidimensional practices constructss' (Hofstede 1991:182) is contingent on the inclusion of both perspectives. The organizational literature has tended to emphasise either the technical aspects of practice (Roberts 1996) or the agency aspects organizational practices are ';systematic and customary activities and behaviours of organizational members that are rewarded, supported and expected by a subgroup and/or organization" (Singh, Verbeke &amp; Rhoads 1996:73). A more rounded definition incorporates both aspects: To engage in a social practice involves engaging in a class of actions which are intelligible in and through the concepts which inform them, which have to be understood as directed towards ends which all members of the com- munity of practitioners share, and is defined through the means adopted to the attainment of those ends which are to be understood as determined by the conditions under which the practice is undertaken (Harris 1980:29). The elements of a practice are the actions undertaken by the practitioners, the concepts which give them meaning and symbolic significance, and the aims resources, conditions and constraints which form their context. Organizational practices are thus agency-structure dualities, functionally differentiated, hierar- chically structured, and ;'subjected to various strategies of institutional combination and recombination" (Reed 1989:21). Focusing more closely we can identify another duality, and one which fits the organizational literature more closely. This sees organizational practices as embodying not only task, but also process - goal-related activity on the one hand, and the web of human interac- tion which potentiates it on the other. This is the significant level from the ethical point of view: the ethical character of any practice is formed by the complex interweaving of these two sets of considerations. Tasks may be more or less closely specified-contrast, for instance, the task of wiring a circuit board with the task of collaborating with co-directors to govern a company. They create routines need techniques, use resources: they embody rules? formal or informal, whose primary function is enabling as opposed to constraining (Giddens 1984). However poorly defined or ambiguous, tasks always contain some conception of performance, some notion of goal-achievement. But overall perfor- mance is not only achieved by task success, it is also contingent on process, on "what goes on" between the members of the practice-based group or team. Organi- zational psychology traditionally approaches this issue individualistically, i.e., from</page><page sequence="10">630 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY the point of view of the interaction of the individual with the work-task environ- ment (Schein 1988). People bring their own interests, expectations and perceptions to organizational practice; these in turn are influenced by their worldviews, the mental maps selective, creative by which they interpret their experience. They also bring skills of which they are generally aware, and knowl- edge, both overt and tacit or preconscious. All of this feeds into commitment and motivation. In turn participation in organizational practice develops people's self-identity, which is both constituted by and constitutive of the roles they enact, and is thus socially constructed and maintained (Leflaive 1996). The growth in knowl- edge, both overt and tacit, and the improvement in their skills, both of which come with practice, leads to heightened self-esteem and self-transformative capabilities. Included in these is the ability to reflect on what they do, to learn from mistakes, and to apply creative thinking to future practice "it is thought which distin- guishes activity from practice" (Harris 1980: 30). At best good organizational practice satisfies the perceived needs of employees for status, meaning and pride of achievement, and thus enables personal growth and development (Schein 1988). However, in recent years there has been a shift in the literature away from the concentration on the individual aspects of practice and towards an interest in collective-level processes (Belbin 1996, Manz &amp; Sims 1995). Changes in orga- nizational structure and design needed to cope with the accelerated pace of innovation and change, increased flexibility, flatter organizations, have led to a growth in teamworking as the most appropriate way of ensuring quality and performance. This has focused the attention of researchers on group processes. Identifying the kinds of processes which are integral to good group functioning, and the qualities necessary for their realisation, has become an essential part of good management practice for organizations seeking to achieve adaptive re- sponses to innovation and change (Anderson &amp; West 1994, West 1994, Industrial Society 1996b, 1995). Examples of these processes, and the personal and collec- tive qualities necessary for their functioning, include: Information sharing openness, trust, affirmation, respect, participation, willingness to listen Creativity and innovativeness- supportiveness, articulated and enacted, willingness to respond to challenge Objective settinglarity of purpose, common sense, commitment, realism Task evaluation concern for excellence, willingness to monitor and be monitored, judgement, cooperation Social interaction spontaneity, tolerance, energy, independence of character (Anderson &amp; West 1994). "Good practice" thus requires specific personal and group qualities and values to support its effectiveness.</page><page sequence="11">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 631 Dynamic aspects of organizational practices raise a number of issues.7 Both team processes and task performance can be monitored and improved over time (Anderson &amp; West 1996, West 1994), so that practices form the setting for con- tinual learning at both the individual and the collective level. This can be simple "single loop" learning, where experience is assimilated into existing frameworks of understanding and interpretation. Or learning can go deeper: lessons learnt can challenge existing mental models, group certainties, and lead to the creation of new understandings and consequent new ways of interacting. This is "double- loop" learning, which may entail a fundamental consideration of ways in which group learning happens and can be facilitated: people learn to learn together (Senge 1990, Argyris &amp; Schon 1978). At best the results of the learning process become "theory-in-use" they are implemented and serve to alter practice. The alternative is that lessons are acknowledged but not implemented they become part of the corpus of "espoused theory." The result is a gap between actual and best practice. Also, organizational practices do not necessarily generate optimal group processes. There is a significant strand in the literature concerned with organizational practices "flawed" by the workings of power relations (Clegg 1994, 1989), by opportunism (Williamson 1981), and by narcissistic behaviour of individuals (Schwartz 1990). (ii) The context of organizational practice discourse: narrative as sensemaking Practices are interpreted and given meaning in terms of the shared concepts internal to particular practices. People need to make collective sense of their experience in organizations by verbalising shared experience "how do I know what I think till I see what I say" (Weick 1979:133). They need to be able to give a plausible account of the present in the context of the past, to find unity in their experience, and to establish and maintain their own identity in the light of that experience. And finally, they need to be able to live each day in a way which is congruent with experience and their interpretation of it in order to maintain coherence between action and cognition (Weick 1995). In other words, they need to satisfy the very human need to make sense out of what is often seen as non- sense, to create meaning out of experiences which are in themselves meaning-less. Sensemaking is achieved by a variety of discourses. Ideological discourse simplifies the world by filtering unwanted complexities, rational means-ends discourse supports theories-in-use (Argyris 1976) until some disjuncture forces reference back to espoused theory, discourses of tradition create templates of conduct (Shils 1981). However, because people tend to think narratively rather than argumentatively (Bruner 1986), the performance of stories is a key element in organizational sense-making. Organizational stories are essentially a mode of ordering organizational realities (Law 1994), allowing members to supplement their own individual memories with institutional memory (Boje 1991). They do</page><page sequence="12">632 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY not necessarily replicate historical "facts," they filter past experience and order events so as to produce a desired outcome, one which fits the present need to comprehend and control interpretations of the past. Sense is created by the se- quence in which the story unfolds: cause and effect is not as important as the internal logic and coherence which the narrative's structure demonstrates. Sense is also created by the story's positive or negative evaluation of the organiza- tional context, depending on whether people want to be working for the best or the worst organization in the business (Martin et al 1983). Organizational sto- ries are dynamic, in the sense that they vary by context, and get revised in the telling (Boje 1991). But organizational stories fulfill other functions, both cog- nitive and affective. They create the myths which transmit and reinforce shared values and meanings (Mahler 1988, Gabriel 1991). They act as symbols which serve to maintain order and control (Wilkins 1983). They can affirm the worth and "rightness" of organizational practices, but they can also serve to articulate the sense of threat in organizational change situations (Van Buskirk &amp; McGrath 1992). They can serve as safety valves in a tense and frustrating organizational culture (Jones 1991). (iii) The context of organizational practice- culture and climate Organizational practices are embedded in the wider organizational context. The question is how to conceptualise that context. Organization theory gives us two options we can either characterise the context of practice as climate or as culture. Both perspectives "could be regarded as examining the internal social psychological environment of organizations and the relationship of that environment to individual meaning and organizational adaptation" (Denison 1996:625). However, the literature on these two contextual views over the last decade has presented the appearance of a battlefield on which yet another battle in the "paradigm wars" has been fought without any substantive result. One of the most obvious differences between the two concepts has been created by difference in research methodologies: climate has been largely researched quantitatively, culture qualitatively. However, this difference is now becoming blurred by current research practice. In fact, it can be argued that the difference between the two concepts is interpretative rather than phenomenological The term "organizational climate" refers to a situation, to the immediate con- text of organizational practice as experienced by those involved. Organizational climate affects expectations, attitudes and behaviours. It is subjective in the sense that it is something experienced and interpreted, but it can be described and is thus cognitive and has a reality which is independent of perception. It is diverse to the extent that practices are diverse, so that it may be thought of at the level of particular practices as well as more generally. It characterises the "environment" of practices but is at the same time influenced by those practices. It is temporal and can therefore change, sometimes because it is manipulated by those involved. Some dimensions of "climate" include reward, warmth/approval, consideration/</page><page sequence="13">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 633 support and freedornlautonomy (Poole 1985). Empirical work attests (a) to the sociological validity of the concept, (b) to its descriptive quality, (c) to its effect on expectations, attitudes and behaviours and hence its interaction with organi- zational practices, and (d) to its consequent importance for organizational outcomes (Poole 1985). Culture, on the other hand, refers to an "evolved" context which is rooted in history, collectively held and sufficiently complex to resist opportunistic at- tempts at manipulation (Denison 1996:644). A given situation, or 'iclimate," may be embedded within an organizational culture. Although the concept of culture is not directly translatable from the national to the organizational context (Hofstede 1991), cultures within organizations tend to constitute traditions of shared assumptions about "what works" (Schein 1985), shared values more or less "bought into" by organizational members, and shared perceptions of the norms governing daily practice (Hofstede 1991:183). Organizational cultures have their myths and symbols, their heroes, and their rituals. Their particular character is formed by the mix of societal influences, the '4style" of a dominant leader or founder, the industrial contexts technology, and structural factors within the organization. "Culture" can have a major influence on every element of or- ganizational life and practice, or it can be more diffuse and fragmented. The strength of organizational cultures can be measured by the degree of consensus, and by the depth and range of its influence on beliefs, attitudes and values (Payne 1990). (iv) Organizational decision making The organizational literature on decision making is extensive. One strand deals with the decision which is routine, repetitive, and fully understood in terms of ends and means. Here the approach is computational: decision-support techniques concentrate on information search procedures and the design of algorithms (March 1988, Butler 1993). Decisions which are non-routine, where there is uncertainty, and where ends are imperfectly understood are examined from a variety of perspectives. Much of the research concentrates on psychological aspects of decision taking-problem definition, or "framing" (Tversky &amp; Kahneman 1981), the prevalence of "bounded rationality" (Simon 1976), intuition and judgement (Isenberg 1984), sources of bias and error coping (Hogarth 1980). Objective- empirical studies focus on the identification of patterns within the decision-taking process (Mintzberg 1976, Hickson et al 1986). There is also a considerable body of work on the way in which power and influence are exerted in decision taking (Butler et al. 1993, Hickson 1986), as well as on the ways in which decision taking is affected and constrained by the organizational cultural contexts the institutional environment (Butler 1991), and the wider cultural context (Hofstede 1980). However, little if any attention has been paid in this literature to the normative aspects of the organizational decision-taking process. The preceding sections have presented a conceptual framework, drawn from or- ganization theory and research, which is designed to support a multidimensional</page><page sequence="14">634 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY view of i'ethicality? in organizations. Organizations are characterised as assem- blages of practices in order to highlight the importance of agency. Organizational practices are situated within a given climate, interpreted in a discourse of sensemaking, rooted in an organizational culture, and shaped by processes of decision taking which are themselves part of the corpus of practice. However, there is one further element which needs to be added to this accounts For the moral agents whether individual or collective, it is purpose which gives action focus and direction7 so that in order to give this conceptual framework a defini- tive ethical ';thrust" we need an account of corporate purpose which is more comprehensive and reflective than strategic means-ends rationality. This issue is dealt with below. I14 THEORISING ETHICS IN ORGANIZATIONS (i) The "good2 and the 'sright" Building on the model outlined above it is possible to develop a philosophical framework by which the normative aspects of "organization' can be conceptualised in a way which is consistent with agent-based ethical theory. Agent-centred ethics is based on the view that the moral agent seeks the "good." We can approach the idea of organizational ;;goods' by drawing an initial distinction between three axiological elementse three senses of the word '4good- the pragmatic, the ethical and the moral (Habermas 1993 1990). The pragmatic is concerned with the good in the sense of the effective, the ethical is concerned with the good in the sense of what is important and meaningful to a "good lifE," and the right is concerned with what it is moral or just to do in any given circumstance. All "goods," moral and non-moral constitute desirable states: the pragmat}c ;igoods' for business organizations are defined in terms of the ';goods' of effectiveness and performance, but there are also ethical ;goodss' in terms of what serves corporate purpose, and moral ';goods" in the sense of just decisions. Ethical and moral "goods" are interactive in the life of any individual or collective moral agent: the rightness of action is judged in relation to the values which underpin self-understanding and identity, those values in turn are grounded in the way in which ;'the good' is defined and the mode of living by which it is pursued. The implication of this is that for purposes of real world morality the philosophical distinction between "substantive'8 and "procedural" ethics becomes self-defeating.8 Rules and principles without a defining framework by which to make judgements are meaningless Procedural theories are incoherent on their own: procedures need to be legitimated by some understanding of human life and reason? and hence some notion of ';the good' (Taylor 1994). On the other hand, substantive theories of ;;the good" need to be supplemented by procedural theories of moral choice. It is for this reason that a theory of organizational ethics requires both substantive and procedural elements. Ethical theory ordinarily</page><page sequence="15">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 635 favours one or other of these perspectivess but not both. A new theory of the ethical organization therefore needs to be grounded in a dialogical process between representatives of the two traditions-in this case, between the neo- Aristotelianism of Alasdair MacIntyre, critic of modernity, and the neo-Kantianism of Jurgen Habermas, defender of modernity.9 (ii) Purpose-"there is no view from nowhere . . . ^' An evaluation of "the good" relies on establishing notions of purpose. For Aristotle purpose, or telos, was realised by living a life which enabled human flourishing, which involved being "virtuous" in the sense of doing everything well and in such a way as to bring enjoyment and happiness. The Aristotelian description of purpose took into account not only views on human natures but also on the particular circumstances in which life was lived. Being, doing and becoming are interactive: virtuous action is a natural consequence of the capacity for moral judgement and perceptions of the moral good of human flourishing, virtuous action in turn deepens and perfects the capacity of the actor to act virtuously. Purpose is to be conceived of as the goal of the virtuous moral agent- in other words, as the achievement of excellence in terms of the realisation of potential. Two qualifications need to be made if Aristotelian arguments on purpose are to have relevance to the organizational context. The first concerns the distinc- tion between Aristotelian notions of purpose and philosophical positions which contain a "hard' teleology i.e., which see "the rights' as grounded in some ac- count of the goodS where the good is defined independently of the right and hence can be a non-moral good. Utilitarianism, for instance sees the rightness of actions as causally related to the non-moral good of hedonism (Pence 1984), whereas in Aristotle's case the "right" is a constitutive element of the "good" in an ethical sense. Contributions to the business ethics literature which seek to define the telos of business in a non-moral sense i.e., as the maximisation of shareholder value (Friedman 1970, Sternberg 1994) convert Aristotelian tele- ology to a means-ends rationality because they define the "good" in a non-moral sense. The second issue relates to the Aristotelian understanding of virtue as perfectible qualities of habitude exercised in right action. Virtues are not dis- crete ';finished" objective qualities which can be "possessed" as traits or attributes of character. They do not exist prior to? and therefore cannot be defined or dis- cussed separately from, the context in which they are exercised. The objectification and reification of virtues as attributes of ;'business" (Solomon 1992) obscures the essential Aristotelian insight that being, doing and becoming are part of a single ongoing process. ';Virtues' is thus more properly, and more usefully7 thought of as the capacity to "be' virtuous. Neither persons nor organizations can ;'choose" purpose, they can only dis- cover it. Conceptualising collective purpose requires that we move away from Aristotle's ;;metaphysical biology" (MacIntyre 1984) to an understanding of purpose as socially, historically and culturally contextualised. For organizations</page><page sequence="16">636 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY in particular, their conception of telos is closely linked to their perceptions of societal expectations, which are not necessarily always fully articulated (Gray et al 1996). Organizations which seek to define "purpose" in mission statements therefore tend to do so in terms of the welfare of groups of stockholders or stake- holders, so that in the first instance it is only by listening to all stakeholders that purpose in the sense of corporate vision can be formulated (Zadek &amp; Evans 1993, Reyes &amp; Kleiner 1990). But since stakeholder interests conflict, and some groups are more powerful than others, a sense of corporate purpose can only be fully developed by corporate reflection on what the company is "for" in an existential as opposed to a merely instrumental sense (Handy 1993). In this sense corporate purpose is about doing what the company is there to do in the first place as well as it can possibly be done- in other words, it is about achieving corporate ex- cellence. Since the particular "excellence'? of each company will be different, so also will the realisation of the good in each particular case. And because what the company does is what the people in the company do, corporate purpose as excellence implicates both the corporate community, and the wider community of stakeholders in a process of refining understandings of corporate purpose. The realisation of corporate purpose-as-excellence requires the corporate com- munity to define corporate objectives and the practices necessary to attain them with regard to the future flourishing of the company in all its aspects, so as to '4create an organization with which members can identify, in which they share a sense of pride and to which they are willing to commit" (Bartlett &amp; Ghoshal 1994:81). In this way the company can move towards closing the gap between what it is and what it has the potential to become and to achieve. (iii) Practice: the locus of the 'good" Corporate purpose forms the starting point of any account of an agent-centred corporate ethics. Purposes are realised in practices, so that the organizational "good" is pursued and achieved in the context of organizational practice. Alasdair MacIntyre's socially teleological account of virtue (MacIntyre 1985:197) identifies "practice" as the context within which virtue gains primary meaning in all historical understandings of virtue. By a practice MacIntyre means: any coherent and complex form of socially-established co-operative human activity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realised in the course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are appro- priate to, and partially definitive of, that form of activity (1985:187). MacIntyre is clearly describing the same reality as is practice-based organization theory, but his interpretation of its significance is different. Every practice has "structure" in Giddens's sense in that it involves standards of excellence, obedience to rules, modes of performance, strategies for efficiency or success. These can only be recognised and identified by actual participation in the practice in question, and they are particular to each practice. It is this aspect of "practice"</page><page sequence="17">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 637 which is of central significance in MacIntyre's ethical theory, because he sees practice as the form of human activity in which human "goods" are realised, and the nature of the practice determines the ways in which this happens. A practice is never just a set of technical skills: it is also distinctive in terms of the dialectic between the ends served by those skills and the transformation of human capabilities which their exercise brings about. Participation realises the "goods internal to a practice" in the sense that human powers to achieve excellence, and human conceptions of the ends and goods involved, are systematically extended (MacIntyre 1985:187). It is only by "practising" a practice that it is possible to understand the interaction between what it demands of the practitioner and what it does to her. Only artists, or teachers, or bricklayers (or researchers) can appreciate the exact nature of the dynamic between the practice, skill, craft, art on the one hand, and the development and extension of their own powers, knowledge, skills and capabilities on the other. It is in the attainment of that excellence, these "goods internal to the practice," that the participants become something other than interested amateurs: their status as "practitioners" gives them competence, the confidence of expertise, and it also extends their own capabilities. "Good practice" produces not only good products, but over time it also produces good people. By translating the Aristotelian insight on human "becoming" into the context of shared social activity, MacIntyre at one stroke rejects the naturalistic empha- sis of "virtue ethics" and locates the achievement of the "good" firmly in the collective and participative context. It is not in individualist isolation, but in practical collaboration with others, that personal growth and development takes place. Shared activities happen in all sorts of contexts, but shared practices in MacIntyre's sense of the word tend to be institutionalised in organizations. As we saw earlier, the organizational psychology literature (Schein 1988) recognises the relationship between work practices and human need fulfillment as signifi- cant. But the emphasis in that literature is instrumental in that it analyses the significance of this relationship in terms of motivation and retention rates, whereas MacIntyre sees its significance in terms of personal growth and human "becom- ing." MacIntyre's conception of the "goods internal to practice" also has implications for the practice of management, and therefore also for corporate effectiveness and competitive performance. Recent debates in the human resource management literature have tended to see the importance of the "human" as sec- ondary to that of "resource management" (Legge 1995). And yet management structures and policies which emphasise trust, mutuality and communication (Beer et al 1985) are more likely to generate employee commitment, flexibility and quality performance in work practices than those which regard people as "re- sources" whose management is designed to fit with strategy objectives (Fombrun, Tichy &amp; Devanna 1984). The implication is that the "ethical" good can facilitate the achievement of the pragmatic "good." Even without this added bonuss MacIntyre's insight that the realisation of the "goods internal to practice" is</page><page sequence="18">638 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY contingent on the nature of the practice itself, and his highlighting of the ethical implications of this, generates valuable insights in the organizational context. (iv) Practice: the locus of virtue It is in the context of practice that the idea of virtue gains clarity. Virtue is defined as the qualities necessary to achieve the "goods internal to practice." A virtue is an acquired human quality the possession and exercise of which tends to enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to practices and the lack of which effectively prevents us from achieving any such goods (MacIntyre 1 985 : 1 91 ) . Virtuous qualities are above all the qualities necessary to sustain and "make excellent" the relationships necessary to collaborative practices. Effective collaboration does not work without a certain willingness to subordinate one's own point of view, to listen to criticism, to respect the facts, to take a certain amount of personal risk. Justice, courage and honesty are needed if we are to achieve not merely the instrumental goods of practice, but those "internal" goods which are realised in the search for excellence. The factors which motivate people to collaborate in this way are not defined merely in terms of reward, but also in terms of the gains to be had from interdependence, affiliation and the quality of the human and communal relationships which are built up over time- relationships built on trust, truthfulness, concern for others. Here again there are obvious parallels with current organizational research. Investigations into team functioning identify these "virtues" as the qualities necessary to facilitate effective group performance. These qualities are personal in one sense, but they are also collective manifestations of attributes which contribute to organizational excellence or "flourishing," Aristotelian perfectible qualities of habitude exercised in right action. They both sustain and are sustained by good practice. The management of organizations is itself a practice, and as with other prac- tices, "the ability of a practice to retain its integrity will depend on the way in which the virtues can be and are exercised" (MacIntyre 1985:195). There is an insight here which is crucial to the whole conception of an organization seeking to become "virtuous." The motives, or virtues, which sustain "good practice" at a micro level the pursuit of excellence for its own sake, generosity, other-re- garding behaviour are not sustainable in the longer term if the goods internal to the practice of management are not sought at a "macro" level. Managerial aspirations frequently seek to retain the standards of excellence and the goods internal to practice at a "micro" level whilst at the same time considering that the essence of good management practice lies only in the achievement of "exter- nal" or pragmatic "goods." MacIntyre argues that it is in the nature of such goods that they do not sit easily with the virtues necessary to achieve "internal" goods- courage, honesty, justice. There needs to be a balance, otherwise the dominance of pragmatic "goods" can result in the eventual effacement of virtue (MacIntyre 1984:196). Organizational ethicality in MacIntyre's sense is therefore in significant</page><page sequence="19">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 639 measure determined by the extent to which management seeks to discover the "goods" internal to the practice of management, so that the balance between these and the pragmatic "goods," whether individual or collective, can be main- tained. This is the central issue at the heart of all reflection on business ethics. How can organizations be both profitable and ethical? What is the nature of the relationship between pragmatism and virtue? MacIntyre's emphasis on practice as the locus of virtue has a prophetic qual- ity in that it allows us to see "ethicality" in everyday organizational practices. But MacIntyre's own views on organizations are less constructive, and also, I believe, less applicable. At the core of MacIntyre's critique of modernity lies the view that once work is divorced from its purpose and context, once it becomes the means to the fulfillment of the ends of a managerialised, individualised, bu- reaucratic system, then "true" practices and the goods associated with them are expelled to the margins of society to the games fields, to artists' studios and the achievement of the "goods internal to practice" is thus lessened (MacIntyre 1984). But that criticism is made in the context of the larger "macro" perspec- tive on modernity. At the "micro" organizational level there are signs at the level of both theory and practice that the goods internal to practice are often valued by organizations as much as those external to practice indeed, one actually assists in the realisation of the other in corporate environments where there is an overt commitment to "providing opportunities for personal and professional growth" (Bartlett &amp; Ghoshal 1995:142). At the basis of MacIntyre's view, too, lies the notion that practices are inextricably bound up with a communal context, and that such a context is not longer recognisable in the modern world. But in orga- nizations this is not the case. Organizations are made up of communities, workgroups where there is shared commitment, supportiveness, and the oppor- tunity to participate and make a contribution to the common good. Many people get their only experience of communal life at work. The theoretical notion of organizational "climate" as representing the "environment" of practice closely describes, however impersonally, the communal context of organizational prac- tices. Research which identifies the dimensions of organizational climate as warmth, support, responsibility, identity, structure (Litwin &amp; Stringer 1968) af- firms the existence of ;'community" at the core of the organization. Corporate leaders who create a sense of community help employees to identify with the vision, values and purpose of the organization as a whole (Ghoshal &amp; Bartlett 1995). (v) Narrative: unity and direction Narrativity has a central importance in MacIntyre's moral theory. More specifically, he argues that the realisation of goods internal to practice and the virtues associated with this can only be given significance in the context of the teleological unity, the "story" of individual and corporate lives told with reference to future purpose as well as to past experience. Because action can only be understood in terms of the reasons people give themselves and others for what</page><page sequence="20">BT T C T\TT' o c c TETTN c NT T A D TT' D T V UOllL&lt; L 1 1tO vUSA1 LAL1 640 they do, intelligibility and meaning need to be created by a narrative account of actions which locates present intentions in the context of longer-term intentions, thereby informing the present by some image of future goals or purposes. Only in this way can a sense of the unity of a life in relation to its purpose be gained. MacIntyre's version of "ethical sensemaking," the narrative unity of a moral life, parallels in form and purpose the accounts given in the organizational lit- erature of organizational sensemaking by means of organizational stories. Narrative creates identity and meaning, it provides structure and gives continu- ity. There is no story, whether personal or organizational, which is a "true account," which "tells it like it is." Stories are iconic, windows which point to reality in a particular direction and from a particular standpoint. MacIntyre de- fines that direction in terms of a narrative unity sought, individually or collectively by the ethical subject just as organizations use storytelling to ;'make sense'-i.e., to create unity from a jumble of disparate experiences. As in the case of MacIntyre's ethical subject, organizational storytelling forms a kind of information processing system which produces "recognisable, cogent, defensible and seemingly rational collective accounts that will serve as precedent for indi- vidual assumption, decision and action" (Boje 1991:106). However, the organizational literature on storytelling does not emphasise the value of the teleological element which we find in MacIntyre's understanding of narrative. For MacIntyre, narrative defines the unity of a life in terms of the unity of a "narrative quest" (MacIntyre 1985:219). The characteristic of a quest is that although one has some conception of direction defined by telos or pur- pose, it is the search which is as significant as the prize in the final outcome. So that "the capacity to achieve a narrative unity in one's life that makes possible one's quest for the good is essential to the formation and preservation of human identity and to understand who and what one was, is, and may become" (Colby 1995:136). Sensemaking happens not just by retelling the past in order to inte- grate it into understandings of the present, but in order to interpret both past and present in the light of understandings of purpose. That capacity demands integ- rity, the ability to acknowledge and learn from past failings, the willingness to rethink previous interpretations. And because stories are always heard as well as told, becoming the subject of a narrative implies both accountability and the obligation to ask others to give accountsl°. MacIntyress understanding of narra- tive as quest has profound implications not only for organizational sensemaking in the context of declared organizational purpose, but also for ways in which organizations handle corporate accountability.' (vi) Tradition Both personal histories and the histories of practice are embedded in what MacIntyre calls a "tradition." Tradition is the social and temporal context of narrative: narratives are created to make sense of lives in the context of practices which define the virtues and in turn "sustain and are situated within a tradition</page><page sequence="21">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 641 which provides the resources with which the quest for the good can be pursued (Horton &amp; Mendus 1994:1 1). The boundaries of a tradition are in turn shaped by the narratives which recount their development. A tradition is "constituted by a set of practices and is a mode of understanding their importance and worth: it is the medium by which such practices are shaped and transmitted across generations (Mulhall &amp; Swift 1992:90). It is also "an institutionally embodied framework of shared commitments and . . . problematics through which ongoing enquiry and debate are rendered possible" (Porter 1993:518). The most important point about traditions is that they are not monolithic, not static. Healthy traditions are constituted by arguments about the goods which that tradition embodies as purpose "a living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument . . . precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition" (MacIntyre 1985:222). Traditions which do not embody continual conflictual processes are dying or dead traditions. Continual critical reflection on the practices and traditions of which one is a part ensures that traditions change and develop. The importance of "tradition" for MacIntyre lies in the fact that it is the com- munity of tradition which generates standards of rational enquiry and justification rather than the moral reasoning processes of the autonomous individual decision taker. Practical rationality in the sense of justifying or giving reasons for ac- tion gains its force from the tradition of which it is a part. But since the norms and requirements pertaining to morality are always tradition-dependent, and since there are a multitude of competing and incommensurable traditions, does this not imply a moral relativism? MacIntyre's response is to argue that for each person the standards of the tradition to which she belongs are normative, but no tradition has a monopoly of the truth. If traditions are experiencing internal cri- ses a meeting of rationalities, a dialectical interchange, a process of argumentation, may occur, "out of which there may emerge a discovery of com- mon standards, standards hitherto presupposed, but never before made articulate" (MacIntyre 1994:297). Dialogue, in other words, is necessary for traditions to remain "living," and it is the possibility of dialogue which permits the existence of pluralism in a world where people profess adherence to rival and competing traditions, or deny the relevance of any tradition. Where is "tradition" in an organizational sense? What constitutes the history of practices, the concepts which inform them and the norms by which they are governed? The answer to this lies partly, at least, in the notion of organizational culture. Organizational members bring with them their own "traditions" into the workplace. The differences between their traditions at that point can be largely described in terms of differences in values. At the national level, but particularly cross-culturally, fundamental differences in basic values, acquired in processes of socialisation, manifest themselves in organizationally significant ways (Hampden-Turner 1993). However, value differences, though important within organizations, are peripheral to the concept of organizational culture. The core unity of an organization's culture lies in shared perceptions of daily practices</page><page sequence="22">642 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY (Hofstede 1991:182) and the ways in which these perceptions shape everyday organizational existence. If organizational culture is constituted by organiza- tional practices, is the ways in which they are understood, and is the medium by which they these understandings are shaped and transmitted to new members, then organizational culture constitutes "traditionS' in MacIntyre's sense of the word. (vi) Discourse and decision taking Discourse forms the context of organizational practices. Activities are continually evaluated, new projects planned, strategies formulated, decisions taken. Any organization with a commitment to pursue the "good" in an ethical sense will be concerned that organizational decision-taking processes should be conducted in such a way as to generate morally ';right" outcomes. There is an implicit assumption in agent-centred ethical theory that "right action" will be a natural outcome of virtuous practice, but no account is provided of the procedure by which this is to happen. Kant's account of moral choice envisaged a moral subject guided by the exercise of practical reason to derive a "categorical imperative" which could guide moral judgement. But that moral choice was exercised within a community of tradition which provided norms and standards.l2 In the late twentieth century communities of tradition have lost their force and in some cases even their relevance. In an interconnected and pluralistic world we can no longer rely on traditional democratic or hierarchical ways of achieving social consensus. Tensions are created as the legitimate but differing claims of various social groupings conflict in communities, in organizations, in regions, economies and across national boundaries. The literature on organizational decision taking does not emphasise the consequences of this for decision taking, nor the procedural and interpersonal aspects of the decision-taking process. However, 'discourse ethics" provides a framework within which the normative aspects of decision taking in organizations can be analysed, and suggests a framework within which differences can be accommodated. If Kantian ethics can be characterised as "the turn to the subject,' discourse ethics can be thought of as "the intersubjective turn" (Rehg 1994). Jurgen Habermas's theory of moral argumentation (Habermas 1993, 1990) replaces the Kantian ';categorical imperative" with a communication framework within which moral agents can collectively seek what is right in the sense of "moral" or "just.7' Discourse ethics starts from the premise that collective decision taking and ac- tion necessarily happen in a climate of conflicting value stances. Decisions have to be made, and yet each participant must argue for what she believes to be moral and just. The process of moral argumentation allows people from differ- ent moral traditions, however coherent or fragmented, each with their own conception of the human good, to search together for what is right and just in practical situations. In other words, it is moral discourse which ensures that plu- ralism about "the good" does not, and should not, entail relativism about "the right.' This process requires certain procedural "ground rules" and certain basic</page><page sequence="23">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 643 attitudinal and behavioural stances. What it does not require is that participants are in any sense "converted" to the value stances of others. Consensus, in other words, does not require unity.l3 What does the process entail? At its simplest, moral argumentation requires that community members participate freely, that they are able to justify ratio- nally the positions they hold, that they can engage in the effort to understand the reasons advanced by others to the point of being able to put themselves in the other's shoes, that they are aware of their own interests in the issue and can express them, and that they are aware of the interests of others and how these will be affected by the outcome of the process. Given all these conditions, how can conflict between opposing views be resolved? The answer lies in the will- ingness of participants to seek for consensus on the issue in question. Discussion which relies on appeal, and/or the use of manipulative techniques to get agree- ment leads at best to compromise, and compromise is a "second best" solution. If consensus does emerge from this process of practical discourse it will repre- sent an example of what Habermas calls his principle of universalisation (U), according to which the moral validity of any decision is judged by whether all affected can accept the consequences and side effects its general obser- vation can be anticipated to have for the satisfaction of everyone's interests (and these consequences are preferred to those of known alternative possi- bilities) (Habermas 1990:65). In other words, genuine consensus will represent a discursively formed general will, and thus in some sense a general "interest." Because it has been arrived at by a constructive and rational process of argumentation it will be more effective in resolving conflict in the longer term than any compromise arrived at more easily. Certain basic attitudes and behaviours are necessary in order to participate in the dialogical process. The first is that the freedom to participate entails a will- ingness to give oneself over to a process of dialogical interchange and reciprocal search, to the logic of argumentation (Rehg 1994:76). This does not imply that personal moral understandings are subsumed in some greater "group norm," but it does entail a double-sided process in which participants are able to explicate their convictions, needs and interests without coercion of any kind, and in such a way that their views can be appreciated by others who have different ideas. As Habermas puts it, the languages and vocabularies must be "porous" to one an- other. This implies that participants are able to rationalise their own position and that they have the imagination to present it in a way which "fits" the interpreta- tive frameworks held by others. It also implies that difference is respected and seen as something which brings a richness to the process rather than as some- thing negative or destructive. The second requirement is a willingness to "hear" the other side of the argu- ment as it is represented by others in other words, not merely to empathise with their position but to seek "insight" into the underlying reasons for their positions. Insight here refers not merely to individual synthetic or reflective</page><page sequence="24">644 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY understandings, but to the fact that the queries and uncertainties, the "further questions" (Lonergan 1958) which need to be resolved before full understand- ing can be attained, before the conditions for a prospective judgement can be fulfilled, concern the positions of others. Insight in this case is intersubjective: it is the arguments of others which present the "further questions," so that the process of moral argumentation becomes one of achievement of successive lev- els of insight in a dynamic listening and learning situation (Rehg 1994:85). As Habermas has recently put it: everyone is required to take the full perspective of everyone else, and thus project herself into the understandings of self and world of all others; from this interlocking of perspectives there emerges an ideally-extended we- perspective from which all can test in common whether they wish to make a controversial norm the basis of their shared practice (Habermas 1995: 117). In other words, participation in moral argumentation requires not only rational, but also affective and intuitive skills. A third requirement of the dialogical process relates to the notion of "inter- est." All the participants in the Habermasian process of moral argumentation are assumed to be arguing from a position of personal interest in other words, they are in some sense affected by the application of the norm which emerges from that process, even if only to the extent that it challenges their views as to what the optimal outcome of the process might have been. It follows that the process of moral argumentation, if it is to be valid, must include all those whose inter- ests are affected in any way by that outcome. This means much more than simply consulting the relevant parties it means that the dialogical process must in- clude them on a equal basis with those who might normally be thought of as the decision takers. This implies that the principle of universalisation contains within itself a commitment to the principles of justice and solidarity justice in the sense that decisions are taken only on the basis that all relevant interests are represented as part of the decision-taking process, and solidarity because all claims to moral objectivity are subjected to intersubjective testing. A genuine "communication community" will be underpinned by the all values necessary to achieve and maintain such a community openness, fairness, solidarity, subsidiarity, tolerance and truthfulness amongst others. Discourse ethics presupposes that argumentation can generate agreement on moral norms. But the reality of organizational decision taking is more complex than this. Discourse is not simply transactional, it is also about the management of difference and the search for ongoing consensus in the face of genuine value dilemmas alternative 'goods" which need to be held in tension. Also, consen- sus is not necessarily complete, nor is it continuous.l4 Much of the reality of organizational life is about the constructive management of value dilemmas so that "virtuous" learning circles are created in other words, it is about allowing value differences to create the richness of diversity rather than destroy the fra- gility of collaboration (Hampden-Turner 1994). However, the important</page><page sequence="25">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 645 contribution of discourse ethics in this context is that it spells out the elements and requirements of a process for "right" decision taking, and, as in the case of practice, organizational "ethicality" lies in process as well as in outcomes. Pro- cesses need to be managed, and the management of the process of decision taking in a climate of value diversity requires altruistic and charismatic leadership which is transformational in the sense that it strengthens people's perception of their own efficacy and worth and thus supports an effective organizational commu- nity of dialogue (Kanungo &amp; Mendonca 1996). v CONCLUSIONAND IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH At the beginning of this paper I argued that business ethics needed to develop a theoretical understanding of the organization as collective moral agent, not only in order to help organizations understand their own ethicality, but in order to place greater emphasis on an agent-centred view of ethics in business. Agent- centred ethics needs a theory of the organizational moral agent which is "recognisable" in terms of ethical theory. I have therefore attempted to create a multidisciplinary conceptual framework by linking organization theory and ethical theory in such a way as to highlight perspectives in organization theory which are significant in terms of ethical theory. This framework has identified the ethical significance of organizational practices both in terms of their effects on participants and in terms of the "virtuous" collaboration necessary to sustain them. It has highlighted the ethical relevance of the organizational climate which supports practices, of the organizational culture by which they are shaped and understood, and of the stories by which participants make sense of organizational experience. It has argued that the morality of organizational decision taking is to be evaluated not merely in terms of outcomes, but also, and more effectively, in terms of the nature of the decision-taking process. The "fingerprint" of the ethical organization developed in this paper is shaped by the thinking of two philosophers who engage with different aspects of ethicality, but u ho share a common concern for the problems of realising the "good" and the "right" in communal and collective contexts where values and aspirations are heterogeneous. Figure 3 sets out the analytical framework. What are the practical implications of this analysis? Its relevance will vary by type of organization, by sector, and by cultural context. However, it suggests that organizational ethicality is something more than compliance with externally imposed regulations or standards, that it needs to be recognised by the culture of the organization as a positive quality of business excellence. It indicates that organizations wishing to be "ethical" will recognise that successful wealth-cre- ation requires an organizational climate which acknowledges basic human priorities. Organizations need to recognise that work practices can contain within themselves "goods" which allow people to develop their capabilities, and they need to facilitate "good" practices in this sense. They need to consider how col- laboration engenders individual and collective "virtues" which contribute towards</page><page sequence="26"> 646 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY the excellence of practice as well as creating "goodS' business They also need to be sensitive to the kind of communication climate with which the organization is workings realising that an organization represents a "communication commu- nity' in which every member has the right to be part of every decision taken. The value and worth of all stakeholders is only truly reflected in processes which are consultative and respectful of the needs and interests of everyone involved. Organizations need to create transparencys work towards consensuse consult as wide}y as possible and ensure that the interests of those not represented at the point of decision taking are taken into account, above all those stakeholders who do not have a voice.15 In particular organizations need to consider whether programmes for change are understood and implemented in such a way as to prioritise involvement co-operations trust and personal responsibility. - The sgood' is defined in pllrpos* - And realised in pnctices Prauices are susvined by wirhles - Practices suppon and are supponed in commuBiq - Narrative expresses the unity and the identity of a rnoral life by articulating its history and its future - The tradition within which narrative is embedded and ptices understood provides the basis of rational justification _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - The 'nght' is established by means of a discourse of moral argumentatio - corporate purpose 1S defined in terrns of exceilence _________________________ - Organizational practices as task filfill humarl needs, as collaborative 'prsess' they are sustained by the gualitia which enable effective tearnwork ____ ______________________ - Pradices are supported by a climate which iilitates learning __________________________ - Organizational narratives play a key part in organizational sensemaking - Organizational culture is the medium by which prauices we understoi md transmieed - OrganizationaJ decision-taking involves a colleuive choiee prze There are a number of research areas to which this analysis might usefully be applied.

Igure 3</page><page sequence="27">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 647 Notes I am grateful to Dr. John Hendry and to Professor Patricia Werhane for helpful comments on a draft of this paper. lI understand "ethicality" to be a concept which contains notions of "degree", or "mea- sure". The words '4ethical organization" in the title of the paper carry idealist connotations, as if "being ethical" is to be contrasted only with "being unethical". This paper is based on a vision of ethicality as process in both temporal and spatial senses, as partial in the complex and fragmented entity which is "organization", and as subject to continual re-creation in changing contexts. 2The idea of collective moral agency does not need the anthropomorphism of corporate moral personhood (e.g. French 1995) in order to make it meaningful. Corporate responsibil- ity and corporate accountability are legal realities; and corporate action is collective ;'secondarys' action. Such 'isecondary" action is performed by individual agents, but it is done in the name of and by the authority of the organization, frequently in contexts where it is not possible to identify and attribute responsibility to any single individual or group (Werhane 1985:56). Corporations can therefore be thought of as "secondary" moral agents, although they are not morally autonomous. 3I avoid the term "virtue ethics" here for two reason: firstly because the term is ambigu- ous and subject to a variety of interpretations in the literature (see for instance the essays in French et al. 1988), and secondly because interpretation frequently objectifies ';virtues" in a manner which is particularly inappropriate in the case of the collective moral agent. 4Agent-centred ethics is neo-Aristotelian, and there is a strong strand in the literature which extrapolates from '4virtue ethics" to a discussion of virtues in business (e.g 4 Solomon 1992). However, I reject this particular approach for two reasons: firstly because it is based on a "metaphysical biology" (MacIntyre 1985) in other words, on an Aristotelian view of human nature and purpose which is not only socially and culturally inappropriate, but inap- plicable to collectivities; and secondly because the objectification of "virtues" tends to obscure the essential aspect of ethics-as-process. 5However, there is an inherent contradiction in the incommensurability thesis. If no mean- ingful communication between paradigms can take place, how is it possible for each one to explain the differences between her paradigmatic position and that of others (Weaver &amp; Gioia 1994: 572). 6It is worth noting that bridge building between disciplines can involve a much slighter connection than is being made here. See for instance Hosmer (l995). 7These are merely mentioned here: there is no space to develop their implications. 8Substantive theories are theories of the "good", procedural theories are theories of the "right"; the distinction is often referred to in the textbooks as teleological versus deontologi- cal theories. See, e.g., Taylor 1994. 9There is a philosophical issue of "commensurability" here. Can the views of MacIntyre and Habermas be discussed within the same theoretical framework? There are several rea- sons for believing that this is legitimate, in spite of initial appearances to the contrary, because there is considerable convergence in the thought of the two philosophers (Kelly 1989). l. Authority versus autonomy. MacIntyre argues that practical rationality is tradition-dependent, Habermas believes that modernity has broken with all tra- dition and that because of this it is cast back upon itself and has to create its own normativity out of itself. Effectively, therefore, modernity constitutes its own tradition of rationality (Rehg l 994).</page><page sequence="28">648 BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY 2. Maclntyre believes that justification is linked to a particular concept of ra- tionality and is hence tradition-dependent, Habermas sees justification as established independently of tradition by the universal structural features of communication. But communication as "moral argumentation" which relies for its functioning on the supposition of reciprocal accountability is a mode of discourse which is particular to modernity, and quite culture-specific, so that it is also tradition-dependent in that sense (Benhabib 1986). 3. MacIntyre argues that rival traditions are incommensurable. But he also ar- gues that when traditions are in crisis it may be necessary to dialogue with other traditions in order to learn from them (Maclntyre 1988). Habermas ar- gues that "evaluative questions present themselves . . . as issues of the good life.... they are accessible to rational discussion only within the ... horizon of a concrete historical form of life or the conduct of an individual life" (Habermas 1990: 108). For both, therefore, "goods" are to be discovered in a discursive, dialectial process (Doody 1991). 4. Habermas and MacIntyre both reject universalism in favour of context-de- pendence, and they are both anti-individualist, believing in collective discernment of the right and communal discernment of the good. '°The location of accountability within the narrative as well as the calculative, or para- digmatic, mode of cognition, is an obvious move, given the importance for accountability of narrating events in a meaningful order and with appropriate emphases (Boland 1995). This issue requires fuller consideration. '2Such as, for instance, the 18-19th century Koenigsburg community where Kant lived all his life. l3There is a significant difference in understandings of consensus in the change-manage- ment literature (see, e.g., Eccles 1996). Consensus is not about the suppression of difference, and it is not about gaining agreement as to which values are most important (Hampden- Turner's interpretation in Hampden-Turner 1994:120). "Discourse ethics" suggests a process, together with its underlying preconditions, for reaching consensus on specific decisions which have normative implications, where the participants have differing value stances. l4"Partial" consensus can be conceived of in terms, for instance, of an "overlapping" consensus (Rawls 1987, 1989). Rawls describes this in terms of the development of a kernel of political morality which is grounded on an agreement for a criterion of justice, which "uncovers a sufficiently inclusive concordant fit among political and other values as dis- played in an overlapping consensus" (1987:17). This agreement forms the centre of a web of allegiances to the basic institutions of society which can coexist with the particular ways of life of different social groupings. This, of course, is not the kind of consensus Habermas is talking about. Moral argumentation achieves operational consensus which is issue- and deci- sion-based and therefore ephemeral and needing to be continually recreated. The nearest organizational analogy to a Rawlsian "overlapping consensus" might be the overt commit- ment to corporate purpose which underpins notions of the corporate "good" and motivates organizational decision taking. 15One of the many instances of this is the situation of local communities in countries where global organizations invest.</page><page sequence="29">THEORISING THE ETHICAL ORGANIZATION 649 Bibliography Anderson, N. &amp; West, M.
