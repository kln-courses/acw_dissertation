<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT LOWELL AND THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF THE SUBLIME Henry Hart If Longinus were alive today he undoubtedly would be surprised by the vast proliferation of interpretations of what he once called hupsos. For the Greek philosopher who may or may not have written On the Sublime sometime during the third century A.D., hupsos was a type of highly charged rhetoric intended to elevate listeners, paradoxically, above rhetoric. Geniuses like Homer displayed "a consummate excel- lence and distinction of language . . . not to persuade the audience but to transport them out of themselves" (125). Their goal was ecstasy rather than advocacy. If orators convinced and poets astonished, Longinus argued that the speechmakers should court the muses more deliberately. "A well-timed flash of sublimity," he declared, "scatters everything before it like a bolt of lightning and reveals the full power of the speaker at a single stroke" (125). Whoever witnessed this Zeus- like rhetorical power could not help but absorb the divine afflatus. So captivated was the listener that he lost his sense of identity, merged with the source of power, and ultimately fantasied that he was the source. "Uplifted with a sense of proud possession," Longinus con- fessed, "we are filled with joyful pride, as if we had ourselves pro- duced the very thing we heard" (139). The leap from hupsos to hubris, from sublimity to tragedy, was a small one. Although Longinus found Plato's writings sublime, and therefore must have believed, at least during his enraptured reading, that he was Plato, the older philosopher initiated what would become a deep- seated opposition to the sublime poetic frenzies Longinus extolled. Longinus was hardly an inflammatory anarchist who thought all inspirations divine; he inveighed against the stylistic excesses that render descriptions ridiculous and characterizations implausible. Neverthe- less, he resisted Plato's rigorous devotion to reason, persistently Contemporary Literature XXXII, 4 0010-7484/91/0004-0496 $1.50/0 ?1991 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">trumpeting the "fine frenzy" (143) of poetic enthusiasm and the "vio- lent upheaval of the soul [that] demands disorder" (191). For this early connoisseur of chaos, disorder was the cause as well as the effect of the sublime's transfiguring power. It was not until Boileau published a French translation of Peri Hupsos in 1674 that the term "sublime" gained currency in Europe, and it was not until the eighteenth century that it became a topic of literary scrutiny and debate in England. Edmund Burke's Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757) bestowed upon the subject its most sustained commentary and also propelled its sundry migrations into disciplines besides aesthetics. Longinus had provided a precedent for different views of the sublime by examining hupsos in religious, political, ethical, and rhetorical con- texts. The sublimity of great writers, he contended, was comparable to the "divine power" that "impregnated" the Pythian priestess and "inspired [her] to utter oracles" (167). Sublime writers, as mythopoeic romantics would claim centuries later, were like gods dispensing grace to dazzled audiences: "Even those who are not easily moved by the divine afflatus share the enthusiasm" (167). With regard to the politics of sublimity, Longinus stipulated that the nobility of the gods, heroes, and great writers can only be appreciated in a democracy, since "Freedom . . . has the power to foster noble minds and to fill it [sic] with high hopes, and with freedom there spreads the spirit of mutual rivalry and eager competition for the foremost place" (247-49). His conception of the sublime, however, is based not on a demo- cratic flattening of hierarchical relations between master and slave but on their reinforcement, and therefore it is slightly ironic that Longinus should condemn his immediate society for its enslavement to pleasure, extravagance, insolence, disorder, and other vices. The sublime requires the listener's sudden enslavement to a masterful rhetorical performance (which incorporates anarchic energies for its shock effect) and the listener's extravagant claim that he has usurped the master's power. It entails presumptuous self-promotion, a clamoring after illusory status, rather than the freedom to scrutinize such pursuits from an enlightened distance. The newly empowered bystander seems to have subverted the hierarchical relations that once trapped him, but his revo- lutionary act is a delusion, an example of what Freud called "the omnipotence of thought" or "wish-fulfillment." After the sublime moment the relation between authoritarian author and subservient witness remains. As a classicist who studied oratory and aesthetics at Kenyon College (the course in aesthetics that he took as a senior under John LOWELL 497</page><page sequence="3">Crowe Ransom was especially important since it familiarized him with Longinus, Burke, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, A. C. Bradley, and other commentators on the sublime), Robert Lowell was preoccupied with the sublime early on. His interest received additional impetus from Allen Tate's essay "Longinus among the New Critics," which was first delivered as a lecture at Johns Hopkins in 1948 (Lowell attended it with Ransom). The essay surveys Kant, Burke, Samuel Monk, and others who have written about the sublime and praises Longinus for specifying that the transport or ecstasy engendered by literatureis a function of its style rather than its subject or author. Since Tate con- sidered his piece "a statement of his own views on literature" (Brown), Lowell must have attended carefully to the words of his old teacher. Despite Lowell's aesthetic predilections, critics have generally ignored the numerous allusions to the sublime in his poems, plays, essays, inter- views, and uncollected writings kept at St. Mark's, Kenyon College, and Harvard. Helen Vendler, who contends that Lowell's later poetry disappoints those who "consider the quest for the sublime a necessary and constitutive condition for the creation of lyric" because it renounces "sublimity of feeling" (157-58), and J. D. McClatchy, who argues that Lowell's "manic, mystic seizures" made him "deeply ambivalent about the American Romantic sublime" (135), are exceptions, but even these scholars fail to delineate the complexity and centrality of Lowell's debate with the ancient term. While Lowell draws on Longinus's notions of the rhetorical sublime (notes from art and literature classes show that he was absorbing Longinian principles as early as his Harvard days), he also draws on Burke's psychological investigation of sublime terror as well as Kant's conception of the sublime as a mental triumph over daunting adversities. Both Burke and Kant analyze the sublime in political, religious, ethical, and natural contexts. While Lowell inherits this multiperspective view, he gravitates in his own explora- tions toward a psychopathology of the sublime. His sublime personae are doggedly oedipal, and Lowell is determined to disclose how their obsessions with overthrowing powerful father figures allow for brief, illusory apotheoses from which they inevitably crash. For Lowell, Freud was the most helpful guide to analyzing sublimity, and he imi- tates the psychoanalyst by mapping the oedipal neuroses behind sublime pursuits. Because the painful power struggles in the family romance and the dangerous sublimations demanded by culture are the twin engines motivating the sublime, Lowell's attitude is characterized by classical oedipal ambivalence. In his 1965 interview with A. Alvarez, Lowell admits that "Freud 498 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="4">is the man who moves me the most. ... Freud seems the only religious teacher. . .. He's a prophet" ("Talk" 40-41). Having acknowledged Freud's importance, he then focuses on the ambitious quest for sublime power among American writers like himself: "We leap for the sublime. You might almost say American literature and culture begins with Paradise Lost. I always think there are two great symbolic figures that stand behind American ambition and culture. One is Milton's Lucifer and the other is Captain Ahab: these two sublime ambitions that are doomed and ready, for their idealism, to face any amount of violence" (42). Lowell could be sketching out the genetic code behind his literary career. In typical, self-aggrandizing fashion, he links his ground- breaking work to the political and religious origins of America. As his poems demonstrate, he strives to embody America and all its vio- lent contradictions and competing factions. Like Whitman and Hart Crane, but without their apocalyptic optimism, his sublime quest is to be America, and for him America is a doomed, tragic hero, whose sublime mission is to triumph over powerful father figures ruling the nation and the rest of the world and whose fate is to destroy itself in the process. Lowell no doubt recalls Freud's speculations on the origins of culture in Totem and Taboo and Civilization and Its Discontents when discussing the origins of American culture with Alvarez. Civilization, according to Freud, is founded on the twin pillars of repression and sublimation, but its discontents yearn to violate its taboos and regress back to an oedipal situation in which the anarchic libido can satisfy its polymorphous desires. Near the end of Totem and Taboo, Freud affirms, "the beginnings of religion, ethics, society, and art meet in the Oedipus complex" (202). The various totem figures in early cultures are avatars of an original father; the various taboos against killing the totem animal and against sexual intercourse with totem cohorts of the opposite sex are vestiges of prohibitions against parricide and incest. An ambivalence toward these prohibitions, however, persists. Although "the totem religion had issued from the sense of guilt of the sons as an attempt to palliate this feeling [of reverence and murderous hate for the father-god] and to conciliate the injured father through subsequent obedience" (187), the sons continue to harbor ani- mosity toward religious commandments and rituals. Like the oedipal heroes in tragic art, they still entertain plans of killing the father and absconding with the mother. For Lowell the sublime moment comes in the son's actual or fantasied displacement of the father and appropriation of the mother. LOWELL 499</page><page sequence="5">His autobiographical essay "91 Revere Street" in Life Studies mock- ingly recollects his mother's image of his father as "a sublime man." She has "suitably sublimed" (18) him to Napoleonic and Wagnerian proportions. Both mother and son collaborate in overthrowing this sublime figure in order to attain their own visions of sublimity. The collaboration is incestuous; Lowell's mother wants to play Jocasta to his Oedipus. When Commander Lowell returns to his post at the Naval Yard one Christmas Eve, Mrs. Lowell rushes into her son's bedroom: "She hugged me. She said, 'Oh Bobby, it's such a comfort to have a man in the house'" (24). Only a child, Lowell resists his mother's advances. A late sonnet, "1930's 9," however, records a fantasy of their sublime, orgasmic liaison: "It makes one larger to sleep with the sublime; / the Great Mother shivers under the dead oak" (112). This fantasy triggers the following sonnets in History about Lowell's fight with his father over his early girlfriend Anne Dick, near the end of 1936: "I knocked my father down. He sat on the carpet - / my mother calling from the top of the carpeted stairs, / their glass door locking behind me, no cover" (112). An oedipal assault on the father and sub- sequent pursuit of a motherly woman, who promised sublime dispensa- tions, was a strategy that recurred in Lowell's life and art. After attacking his father (in an early uncollected poem he uses the naval metaphor of torpedoing), Lowell met with the psychiatrist and sonneteer Merrill Moore, who not only eased family tensions but helped the young Lowell launch his literary career. Through Moore he was introduced to Ford Madox Ford and then to Allen Tate. Four months after the incident with his father, he recalls in "Visiting the Tates," he drove to Tennessee, "full of Miltonic, vaguely piratical ambitions." Still determined to assault all patriarchal figures, he re- enacted Civil War hostilities when he "crashed the civilization of the South" by driving his car into "the Tates' frail agrarian mail box" (557). Milton, whom Lowell identified with sublime rebellions in his talk with Alvarez, is a likely model for Lowell's historicizing mind because he too took part in a civil war (against the patriarchal King Charles in seventeenth-century England). Milton's iconoclastic stance reminds Lowell of his poetic origins as well as America's historical origins. All origins, Lowell implies, depend on sins of violation and aggrandizement, of upstart powers overthrowing reigning ones. Ahab's bellicose attempts to subdue superior powers resemble Milton's and Lucifer's and for Lowell illustrate both the madness and nobility of sublime endeavors. Like David Hume and many other eighteenth- century thinkers drawn by the appeal of sublimity, which was usually associated with the republican values of the Tory opposition but which 500 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="6">ran counter to the well-mannered, rational styles that they refused to abandon, Lowell is both for and against the sublime. His concern for the psychopathology of the sublime harks back to French writers of the period, such as Pierre Bayle and those who in the Port-Royalist's Art of Speaking asserted that sublime figures were the products of deranged minds. Closer to home, Moby Dick, which frequently invokes the sublime to dramatize the whale hunt and the awesome terrors and majesties of the whale, served as an early case study for Lowell's concerns. Even as a teenager he was aware of the madness and destruc- tion that the sublime could unleash. In the sonnet "For Frank Parker 2," which appears shortly before "1930's 9" in History, Lowell derides his first attempts to capture Melvillean sublimities: "as we drifted I tried to put our rapture in verse: / When sunset rouged the sun- embittered surf. / This was the nearest we got to Melville's Nantucket" (111). He would later refer to this period as steeped in "pathological enthusiasm" (Hamilton 226-27). Several sonnets later, rehashing the anger over his father's romantic meddlings, he confesses his early alliance with Milton: "That morning nursing my dark, quiet fire / on the empty steps of the Harvard Fieldhouse in / vacation . . . saying the start of Lycidas to myself / fevering my mind and cooling my hot nerves" (112). These private agons have more public ramifications when Lowell compares them (as in his early "Rebellion," rewritten as "Father" in History) to the American Revolution and the birth of American culture. Just as Milton fought against kings, defending regicide in his inflammatory Defence of the English People and romanticizing Satan in his battle against God in Paradise Lost (and nearly suffering the consequences of his insubordination when Charles II took the throne after Crom- well), America fought against King George, Melville's Ahab fought against Moby Dick (whom Lowell equates with Jehovah-"IS, the whited monster"-in "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket"), and Lowell fought against his "suitably sublimed" father and other powerful patriarchal figures, like President Roosevelt when he resisted the draft in World War II and President Johnson when he publicly rebuked Johnson's Vietnam policy by refusing to attend his arts festival. In each case Lowell hangs a liberal wreath on such principled rebellions while his conservative sentiments recoil in shock and guilt, condemning such acts as bad and mad. (His excoriating reflection on his "manic statement, / telling off the state and president" [Life Studies 88] in "Memories of West Street and Lepke" is typical, as is his sympathetic identification with the alleged enemy, Johnson, in "Waking Early Sunday Morning.") LOWELL 501</page><page sequence="7">The second section of Thomas Weiskel's The Romantic Sublime, entitled "The Psychology of the Sublime," offers a penetrating analysis of the sort of competitive power struggle that lay behind Lowell's Miltonic and Melvillian ambitions. Weiskel's thesis finds support in Freud: "The sublime moment recapitulates and thereby reestablishes the oedipus complex, whose positive resolution is the basis of culture itself" (94). Alluding to Burke and Kant, Weiskel argues that the sublime moment depends on "a positive 'identification' with the Father, an identification which both presupposes the renunciation of parri- cidal aggression and facilitates an escape from the imagined con- sequences of a murder" (91). This identification makes way for an introjection of the superior power and the formation of a superego which, through a complex process of sublimation, ends up being more daunting than its actual model. For Kant, this superego is the seat of reason, morality, and divinity; it can transcend life's terrors by reducing them to concepts. For Freud the formula for the sublime might be, Let ego be where id is and let superego be where ego is. But as Freud certainly knew, the superego's sublime civilizing powers are wedded to the forces of destruction. Once the judgmental father is inside and once the son is the father, the superego will turn on itself, punishing the psyche for its aggressive aggrandizement. "Pathologi- cally," Weiskel comments, "this results either in obsessional neurosis - when the ego refuses to acknowledge guilt - or in melancholia - when the ego accepts the guilt" (96). Lowell's leaps for the sublime are partly motivated by his wish to transcend melancholy, his descents partly by his guilty recognitions of the antics and crimes he committed while doing so. Jahan Ramazani in an essay on Yeats points out that "mania corresponds to the sublime" because, as Freud showed, mania has access to "the whole quota of anticathexis which the painful suffering of melancholia had drawn to itself from the ego" (165). Once released from despair, the liberated, cathected ego flies off on explosive energies toward a phantasmal empyrean. For Lowell this heaven beyond melancholy was populated with tyrannical patriarchs and Nietzsche's supermen rather than Yeats's golden codgers. Because he struggled throughout his life to outdo his real father and the image of him he internalized, forgoing the ordinary oedipal resolution, he soared and plummeted repeatedly. His manic- depressive cycle, while fundamentally chemical, was abetted by his unwillingness to repudiate his sublime models - the Caligulas, Napoleons, Mussolinis, and Hitlers he identified with when possessed by "pathological enthusiasm." If his father was a benign naval officer, he would be a menacing martinet or imperial commander in order to 502 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="8">triumph over him. As Ian Hamilton's biography attests, Lowell was always deeply embarrassed by his manic charades, but when lithium was prescribed near the end of his life, like other patients reluctant to sacrifice the joys of mania, he refused to administer it as directed. With many of his contemporaries (Roethke, Berryman, Plath, Sexton), he associated creative inspiration with manic power, and in order to achieve that sublimity he allowed hubris to catapult him beyond the ego's limits and then, following Satan and Ahab, fell into guilty depres- sion when sanity resumed. By referring to his manic episodes as "attack[s] of pathological enthusiasm" (Hamilton 157), Lowell allied himself with those eighteenth-century evangelical Protestant movements that endorsed "enthusiasm," "inspiration," and "inner light" as manifestations of the god within (the en-theos or in-spiritus). "Inner light" Quakers quaked; Shakers shook. Jonathan Edwards whipped his congregations into such frenzies of religious enthusiasm that Charles Chauncey, a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, felt compelled on behalf of the college to attack Edwards and everything he stood for in his address "Enthusiasm Described and Caution'd Against" (1742). A lapsed Harvard man himself, Lowell identified with Edwards's enthusiasms and began to write a biography of the New England divine while living with the Tates at Monteagle in 1942. Most discussions of the sublime, interestingly enough, employ enthusiasm as its synonym or its symp- tom. The Earl of Shaftesbury, in "A Letter Concerning Enthusiasm," warned as early as 1707 that enthusiasm in melancholy dispositions spawned delusions and disease, but in noble, rational, good-tempered Christian minds it could be creative and sublime: "inspiration may be justly called divine enthusiasm; for the word itself signifies divine presence, and was made use of by the philosopher [Plato] whom the earliest Christian Fathers called divine, to express whatever was sublime in human passions" (38). Shaftesbury may be echoing the passage in Longinus that places Plato and Homer on a similar level of sublime "enthusiasm" and "grandeur" (167). Although Samuel Monk in The Sublime rather blithely remarks, "The development of the sublime was a sort of Methodist revival in art" (235), and shows how various eighteenth-century writers "tried to establish sublime poetry upon enthusiastic emotion" (235-36), some of the principal commentators of the age detected the pathological potential of sublime enthusiasm and warned against it. Even Burke, who praised obscurity as sublime because "In reality a great clearness helps but little towards affecting the passions, as it is in some sort an enemy to all enthusiasms whatsoever" (60) and celebrated the LOWELL 503</page><page sequence="9">"fanatic preacher" because he incites sublime passion among the ignorant, was aware of the pitfalls of sublime enthusiasm. He predicts Freud and Weiskel when he argues that the sublime rouses us out of "melancholy, dejection, despair" and other moribund moods of the "relaxed state of body" (135) but only to catapult us into incapacitat- ing frenzies. Still, like the pathologists after him, Burke recognizes that sublime power can become an addiction, an obsession that insti- gates neurotic repetitions: "This is the reason of an appearance very frequent in madmen; that they remain whole days and nights, some- times whole years, in the constant repetition of some remark, some complaint, or song; which having struck powerfully on their disordered imagination, in the beginning of their phrensy, every repetition rein- forces it with new strength; and the hurry of their spirits, unrestrained by the curb of reason, continues it to the end of their lives" (74). Two centuries later Weiskel makes a similar connection between the mind's need to re-enact powerful stimuli, its longing for sublimity, and obses- sional neurosis. Reacting against Burke's generally negative assessment of the sublime-his endorsement of terror, pain, darkness, and all sorts of other privations -Kant tried to resolve the enthusiasm-versus-sublimity debate by first conceding that "from an aesthetic point of view, enthu- siasm is sublime, because it is an effort of one's powers called forth by ideas which give to the mind an impetus of far stronger and more enduring efficacy than the stimulus afforded by sensible representa- tions" (124). Kant knew that without the antidote of reason and morality, enthusiasm could become pathological enough to transform ideas into delusions, so he added: "If enthusiasm is comparable to delirium, fanaticism may be compared to mania. Of these the latter is least of all compatible with the sublime, for it is profoundly ridicu- lous." Brooding on evangelical zealots of all stripes, he concluded that fanatical enthusiasm was "an undermining disease" (128). All too familiar with the disease of mania, Lowell was neverthe- less skeptical of Kant's exclusionary demarcations. For Lowell the sublime enthusiast and maniacal fanatic were close cousins or, indeed, the same person. Because Lowell refused to ground the sublime in the logos of divine reason, choosing instead to locate it in a transcendence of that logos, his sublime heroes (his Ahabs and Lucifers) were more like Nietzsche's Zarathustra. They were higher men leaping above pedestrian notions of good and evil, spurning the herd's morality, embracing the will to power. Kant's Christian philosopher who seeks to give conventional morality a rational justi- fication was part of a bourgeoisie to be resisted. Lowell was painfully 504 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="10">aware of the tragic and comic dimensions of sublime leapers, however, and therefore his resistance to Kant's prudence was tempered with respect. As early as his days at St. Mark's, Lowell dwelt on the proximity of the sublime to what Kant called the "profoundly ridiculous." In a collaborative interpretation of an allegorical drawing by fellow enthusiast Francis Parker (their previous summer on Nantucket in 1934 was a "period of enthusiasm" [Hamilton 226]), Lowell resembles Kant in associating the sublime with a moral, Christian intellect. His sublime hero in "The True Light" is "St. Simon, the Stylite, a symbol of true knowledge" (129). Unlike Kant, and prophetic of his own manic instabilities later on, he views intellectual attainments as bound to the same rhythm of lofty ascents and ridiculous falls as enthusiasm. Lowell's enthusiasm for the intellect, when abetted by the sort of manic devotion he was all too capable of, declined from tragedy to farce. Without the rigorously philosophical mind of Kant, Lowell simply could not abide by moral imperatives. For him mania, reason, enthu- siasm, fanaticism, absurdity, and sublimity collided and merged in the psychological turmoil which he never really escaped. Lowell's introduction to the absurd underside of the sublime probably came from Longinus, who, in examining images from a lost tragedy by Aeschylus, declared, "Examine each [phrase and image] in the light of day and it gradually declines from the terrible to the ridiculous" (129). Focusing on his sublimely intellectual saint (he could just as easily be regarding Kant), Lowell is similarly sardonic. Is the lofty saint on top of his pillar in the desert a bathetic fool, as Pope might mockingly suggest in his Peri Bathos, a satirical takeoff on Longinus's Peri Hupsos, or an example of true nobility? Lowell avers: "St. Simon is elevated high above everyone else by comprehension of the true light. The book and the pen symbolize real intellectual attain- ment, while the plumb line signifies a quite natural feeling of superiority; but more important, his insecurity. 'From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step' " (129). While Kant installed "the true light" of the virtuous mind on an equally lofty pedestal by differentiating and then repressing the "ridicu- lous" mania that can seethe beneath it and, through sublimation, make godly attainments possible in the first place (Weiskel believes that the "vehemence of Kant's attack on fanaticism suggests that his analytic is vulnerable here, for after all, on his own showing the fanatic is entirely in accord with reason" [40]), Lowell as an idealistic young man sympathizes with the Kantian apotheosis of reason but then, as if to deconstruct its logocentrism, quickly points to its "more impor- LOWELL 505</page><page sequence="11">tant ... insecurity." Like the plumb bob suspended from the saint's hand, the sublime in Lowell's psychological view depends on the unstable sublimation of anarchic libidinous energies which, in his own life, would subvert whatever lofty moral principles he had. Against the philosopher-saint's idealism Lowell juxtaposes the lessons of history which render them ridiculous. Saint Simon, after all, was a fanatic. He was a "pillar saint," either Saint Simeon Stylites the Elder, who lived atop a column in 423 A.D. to escape pestering crowds, or Saint Simeon Stylites the Younger, who lived on various pillars for sixty- nine years during the sixth century (Lowell's youthful historical sensi- bility does not distinguish between them). Lowell's last line comes from a historical figure he knew more thoroughly - Napoleon, that sublime hero of his boyhood reading who, as "91 Revere Street" attests, was comically entangled with visions of that other "sublime man," his father. After his infamous retreat from Moscow in 1812, Napoleon wrote the Polish ambassador, De Pradt, "Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas" ("From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step"). This could just as aptly apply to Lowell's father, to Lowell himself, and to his many outrageously idealized heroes. As Lowell got older, his models for the sublime changed from those that represented intellectual and moral power to those repre- senting sexual and political power. The gods, as he explains in the late sonnet "Words," are not the reasoning saints and philosophers of former eras but the political monsters like Hitler and Mussolini who possess the blind, demonic ambition of Satan. To label these maniacal fanatics sublime would be a travesty for Kant. The logic of Lowell's oedipal psychodramas was such, however, that he felt compelled to outmaneuver his father, who was consistently portrayed as ridiculous, and substitute in his place military strongmen who could be construed as sublime only by a mind deranged by mania. The reason he resists an oedipal resolution is because he finds identifying with his father mortifying. The concluding lines of a poem like "Home after Three Months Away" typify his fear that, after recovering from a bout of pathological enthusiasm in which mania has engendered a sublime transcendence of all his father stands for, he will now have to submit to the kind of impotence and absurdity his father represents. Like his father in retirement, Lowell confesses: "I keep no rank nor station. / Cured, I am frizzled, stale and small" (Life Studies 84). "Commander Lowell" again traces the complex family romance in which as a seven- year-old boy, "bristling and manic," he becomes the sublime Napoleon, a surrogate husband for his mother, who, in her "hysterical, unmar- 506 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="12">ried panic," has renounced her real husband. Commander Lowell is a parody of the great military leaders that populate his wife's and son's fantasies of masculine power. His naval exploits are confined to the bathos of the bathtub: "Anchors aweigh," Daddy boomed in his bathtub, "Anchors aweigh," when Lever Brothers offered to pay him double what the Navy paid. He was soon fired. Year after year, he still hummed "Anchors aweigh" in the tub- (Life Studies 70-71) Ironically, the Commander's son also "used to enjoy dawdling and humming 'Anchors Aweigh' up Revere Street after a day at school" (20), as Lowell reveals in his autobiographical essay in Life Studies. Lowell's transports purport to avoid the ridiculous deflations his father succumbed to by steering toward more powerful surrogates. This quest, however, is bent awry by Lowell's manic intensities, leav- ing him, much to his sardonic chagrin, in the same tub as his father. When Lowell becomes a father, when he internalizes that image of his actual father as a ridiculous loser, superego and ego war in his psyche, necessitating new surges toward sublime transcendence. The late sonnet "Symptoms" from The Dolphin reveals Lowell in the same bathetic position as his father. He is in the bath, similarly deflated, similarly pathetic. His whining, in fact, expresses a sense of defeat even more overwhelming than his father's robust singing. He com- plains like a spoiled child: I have no mother to lift me in her arms. I feel my old infection, it comes once yearly: lowered good humor, then an ominous rise of irritable enthusiasm. ... I soak, examining and then examining what I really have against myself. (18) What he has against himself is a guilty sense of failure. He cannot win, at least morally, because to embrace his mother's sublime expec- tations of manhood would turn him into a patriarchal monster and LOWELL 507</page><page sequence="13">to acquiesce to his father's example of mindless, even-tempered resig- nation would turn him into a clown. If Lowell's pathological enthusiasms were aimed at sublime triumphs over his father, over other patriarchal figures in his poetic and political culture, and over a superego fabricated from all of these, they were also directed ambivalently at his mother. His sonnet "Mother, 1972" tells of "fearing everything I do / is only (only) a mix of mother and father, / no matter how unlike they were, they are" (History 115). Superegos arise from multifarious tutelary influences, but Lowell always gravitated back to the original two: his parents. Although his poems and plays are crowded with menacing mother figures and father figures, his tumultuous perceptions of his parents inform them all. While his agonistic battles with father figures were comparable to what Kant called the "dynamical" sublime, his agon with his mother led to something similar to "the egotistical sublime." Attacking Words- worth, Keats originally deployed the term to refer to his contemporary's solitary ruminations in which he seemed so wedded to Mother Nature that he could not get out of himself or her. According to Keats, Wordsworth failed to deny his identity and through "negative capabil- ity" (like Shakespeare and other Elizabethan writers whom Keats admired) imaginatively enter a diversity of characters. As Weiskel explains it, "the egotistical sublime" is a version of Freudian narcissism. Because of some loss or other traumatic experi- ence, libido once attached to its object returns to a primary, painless state before identity - the blissful ignorance of womb or tomb - or it returns to a heightened, sublimated conception of the ego. For Weiskel, the egotistical sublime derives from the original relationship with the mother. When the child begins to realize that he as well as his mother are Other, an ego is created out of the sense of loss. Freud speculated that the lost object, whether mother or lover, is retrieved through intro- jection. In his essay "The Theory of the Libido: Narcissism," he avers that mania and melancholia issue from the oscillations of love and hate for the lost, introjected object: "the melancholic has indeed with- drawn his libido from the object, but . . by a process which we must call 'narcissistic identification' he has set up the object within the ego itself, projected it on to the ego. . . . The ego itself is then treated as though it were the abandoned object; it suffers all the revengeful and aggressive treatment which is designed for the object" (434). In Weiskel's adaptation of Freud and Lacan, the egotistical sublime culmi- nates in the love of self, which can be womblike in its obliviousness to painful, external stimuli (the pain of loss is removed by the gainful internalization of the Other or mother that originally abandoned the 508 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="14">ego) as well as divisive, since the ego turns its animosity on the internal image of the betrayer. Many of Lowell's poems dramatize this ambivalence toward the mother or those others who act as her surrogates. In "Symptoms," Lowell's bath is both a womblike "bag of waters" and tomblike "grave of waters" as he laments the death of his mother ("I have no mother to lift me in her arms"). His enthusiasm is partly for the remembered mother within, but despair ensues because Lowell also disapproves of her, the part of her which is inside him, and his obsessive narcis- sistic self-examinations. Elizabeth Hardwick in Sleepless Nights recalls how Lowell would experience "seizures of optimism" when he fell in love with younger women, and then "Alerted to rejection on the very heels of enthusiasm and hope, he would . . . have to retreat" (45). Although Lowell loved his mother through other women, and in his manic phases repeatedly allowed younger women to fan the fires of his enthusiasms, he also despised himself and these other motherly women because of it. Along with his nefarious supermen, they were dangerous sirens drawing him toward the sublime's pathological delusions. The roots of the problem may be traced in Lowell's autobiographi- cal essay "Antebellum Boston," included in his Collected Prose. Lowell says: "When I was three or four years old I first began to think about the time before I was born. Until then, Mother had been everything; at three or four, she began abruptly and gratingly to change into a human being. I wanted to recapture the mother I remembered and so I began to fabricate" (293). Partly abetted by his mother's own fan- tasies, Lowell transfigured his mother into the powerful patriarchal figures that his father was not. She was Alexander: "Mother, her strong chin unprotected and chilled in the helpless autumn, seemed to me the young Alexander, all gleam and panache. . . . Mother, also, was a sort of commander in chief of her virgin battlefield" (295). She was also Napoleon: "She began to bolt her food, and for a time slept on an Army cot and took cold dips in the morning. In all this she could be Napoleon made over in my grandfather's Prussian image" (297). In this complicated oedipal drama, Lowell's mother yearned for the sublime power of her father, whom she nicknamed "Napoleon." Lowell also identified with his Napoleonic aura, so much so that his grand- father became a surrogate father. "He was my Father. I was his son," he says frankly in "Dunbarton." To make family matters more com- plex, his mother, as battlefield commander, also played his surrogate father. In this tangled equation with changing variables, the women that became the objects of Lowell's enthusiasms resemble his sublime LOWELL 509</page><page sequence="15">mother, whose gender is often ambiguous. Lowell rehashes this bizarre family romance in an early uncollected short story, "The Raspberry Sherbert Heart," when the narrator, Charles, contemplates marrying Rose Sharon and then hesitates: "He thought, 'Maybe I'd rather marry Mummy. Daddy could stay around, if he wanted to.' " Having replaced lover with mother, he now treats mother and father with equal indif- ference. "He thought about what fun it would be to call his father 'Mummy,' and his mother 'Daddy.' 'You can do anything with them, if you scramble them and mix them up' " (Houghton 2229).' Collec- tively, Lowell's fatherly mothers and motherly lovers compose a mythical, androgynous Great Mother for whom he ambivalently and incestuously yearned. "It makes one larger to sleep with the sublime; / the Great Mother shivers under the dead oak." The sleep here is sexual and deathly. Eros and Thanatos intermingle, engendering a narcissistic inflation of ego and phallus. Usually Lowell strives for a sardonic detumescence, as in the numerous drafts of the uncollected poem "The Cloister," where he imagines himself as a sublime orator "Ruling by his own wit the fasci- nated crowd." Blaming his need to be "Self-elevated, raised, and stayed" on narcissism, he conjectures that without discipline he would be an anarchic child, "Bright with the (foreknowledge) experience, profound / From sipping his sublimest origin" (Houghton 2049). Sublime tumescence always needs ascetic or satirical deflation to keep it under control. A revision of "The Cloister" reveals the degree of self-lacerating mockery Lowell was capable of when reflecting on his penchant for sublime inflations. Here his journey back to the womb undercuts Wordsworth's egotistical sublime - his intimations of Platonic immor- tality before birth-with Yeatsian derision. The womb is more a "fecund ditch" of embattled sexuality than a blissful Eden. Its "honey of generation" - what Lowell calls "the child-making potion" - is a drug that makes the child forget what most origins are really like. He makes sure that the narcissist's sublime past is revealed in all its dangerous seductiveness, grotesqueness, and absurdity: Sweet that honeyed cist where man is kissed, Deeply, oh too deep, By the whore-pool of your lip.

The quest for sublime origins in the oceanic mother, according to the economy of the psyche that Lowell construes, is ultimately unsound. He echoes Freud on the illusions of narcissistic regression when he declares, obviously thinking of himself: "Man barters natural health / For some factitious and fictitious wealth, / Milksop Narcissus' curdling stare" (Houghton 2051). His characteristic animosity toward the egotistical sublime and, for that matter, all sublimes derives from mythic images of his parents which merged to form his complicated, divided identity. In his analysis of Burke's aesthetic of violence, terror, and pain, Weiskel argues that the sublime apotheosis repeats that moment in the child's oedipal development when, having desired the mother and rejected the father, he overcomes the fear of punishment by the father-his castration anxiety-by realizing it was simply a guilty fantasy: "The fantasy of injury ends in the simultaneous perception of defeat and the realization that the threat is not, after all, a real one. This makes possible a positive resolution of the anxiety in the delight ... which is psychologically an identification with the superior power" (93). Obsessed with castration and power struggles with his parents and their surrogates, Lowell also indicated a desire to be free of them, and free of sublime (phallic and phallogocentric) power in general. His purification mania aimed at purging mania, his sublime battles at defeating the sublime. Yet the sublime usually won out. A fragment of an autobiographical essay written for Life Studies, but not collected, mentions "an attack of pathological enthusiasm" suf- fered in 1949 in Bloomington, Indiana, which, according to Allen Tate, was when Lowell "shouted again and again: 'Cut off my testicles' " (Hamilton 156) to police trying to subdue him. In this sublime seizure, he became a Jehovah figure "crying out against devils and homo- sexuals" and "evil, unexorcised, aboriginal Indians," as if privately orchestrating a last judgment. While rejecting his real father, Lowell identified with the aristocratic, Puritan, and racist "fathers" of his New England heritage - whom he also excoriated - and was determined to outdo them by taking on the divine, apocalyptic powers which they, too, aspired to emulate. "I suspected I was a reincarnation of the Holy Ghost, and had become homicidally hallucinated," he admits, but then adds contritely: "To have known the glory, violence and banality of such an experience is corrupting" (Hamilton 157). LOWELL 511</page><page sequence="17">Drafts of "Caligula," a poem finally published in For the Union Dead, recount a similar experience of purification mania in Buenos Aires, during which Lowell imagines castration as a means of curtail- ing as well as promoting sublime power. "Cleopatra's needle in the main square" rises "like a phallus without flesh or hair," and when Lowell symbolically "lopped the civic power," he becomes an imperial god. Castrating this gender-crossed monument, which recalls Lowell's masculine mother, initiates a similar but more intimate plan for cas- tration involving Lowell and an unspecified bride. The poet proceeds to the tub, his favorite place for negotiating with sublime enthusiasms, and confesses: I... took a cold bath, and rolled my genitals until they shrank to peas, or little balls of icey glass. Marble and purified I marched into the bedroom of my bride: "Let's live like eunuchs, I abolish sex." I moved that crushing millstone from our necks. I knew the old Olympians were a fraud. I was Caligula, the living god. (Houghton 2290) Promiscuity, according to Lowell's manic logic, precludes power, so he concludes the licentious Olympian gods must have been fakes. His sublime powers depend on a gruesome sublimation, on a castration or repression of normal sexuality. Earlier he identifies with "The God, Adonis" who is gored in the thigh but resurrected, at least in Lowell's myth, as an emperor blazing with violent enthusiasms. Again Lowell subscribes to a paradoxical law of compensation whereby the sublime energies he once associated with sexual contact are withdrawn so that they may invigorate his egocentric fantasies of divine or at least imperial grandeur. Since for Lowell the sublime was always enmeshed in the banality of violence, or what his friend Hannah Arendt called "the banality of evil" (Lowell, when manic, could be the Nazi war criminal of Arendt's investigations), and since it often issued from his inflated, narcissistic view of his sexual capacities, an ascetic detumescence in ideology and style was a moral alternative which proved increasingly tempting in his middle and later periods. His most overt poetic debate with the sublime came in "Waking Early Sunday Morning," written in 1965 shortly after he discussed with Alvarez the violent idealism behind the American sublime. There Lowell partially agreed with 512 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="18">English critics, for whom he spoke when he complained, "what every- one finds wrong with American culture is the monotony of the sublime" ("Talk" 433). In his intriguing discussion of the "consciously intended Freudian imagery of phallic power and castration in the poem," Alan Williamson argues that Lowell "fears being castrated if he reveals his full powers and ambitions, literary or ideological; when he prefers sub- jects without apparent 'purpose' or 'meaning,' he is essentially pro- tecting himself by pretending to be castrated already" (49-50). Lowell may fear castration (the powerful father figure in this case is the infuriated President Johnson, whose policies Lowell has just denounced); contradictorily, he also welcomes it. As Williamson rightly points out, "Lowell is, again, deliberately conflating his own faults with those of his adversaries" (53). The moral repudiation of sublime power - "our monotonous sublime" (Near the Ocean 24) as he calls it in his concluding line - amounts to a desire for self-castration. Rather than castrate others in their sublime pursuits, Lowell implies, it would be better if they castrated themselves. Johnson's violent wars and Lowell's manic attacks assure "the blind / swipe of the pruner and his knife / busy about the tree of life" (23). Self-castration would remove the origin of their animosity. Implicit in this moral fantasy is a resolution of Lowell's oedipal drama with his parents - a growing desire to identify with his father's postmilitary serenities and to reject his mother's "hysterical, unmarried" obsessions with "suitably sub- limed" military heroes, including her incestuous flirtations with her father and son. Just as Yeats in "News for the Delphic Oracle" entertains the pos- sibility of being transported on the backs of dolphins toward the Isles of the Blessed, where sex and death promise blissful oblivion (Lowell's The Dolphin is indebted to this conceit), so in "Waking Early Sunday Morning" Lowell imagines being transported "Like the chinook / salmon" to the top of the waterfall's fish ladder "alive enough to spawn and die" (15). Breaking loose after a long struggle and outleaping a much greater adversarial force is Lowell's analogy for what he described to Alvarez as the "leap for the sublime." His chinook salmon incor- porates the "sublime ambitions, that are doomed and ready, for their idealism, to face any amount of violence" which Lowell found proto- typically expressed in Ahab and Lucifer. Although Ahab was excised from the final poem, in an earlier draft the concluding stanza read: No, say we fought and trusted in ourselves to free the earth from sin, were glad like Ahab to go down LOWELL 513</page><page sequence="19">in pride of righteousness, and drown, that we were faithful to this boast, our appetite for which we lost the world, though free of other crime, in the monotonous sublime. (Williamson 62) Ahab here is conflated with Johnson, whose hubris is his righteous American pride, whose missionary zeal is to free the world of the sin of communism, and whose tragedy is Vietnam. In Lowell's translation of Prometheus Bound, which appeared the same year as Near the Ocean (1967), Zeus assumes Johnsonian proportions, although Lowell's intent is to caricature his sublime powers: "he is hidden from the other gods, and is free to play with his thunderbolts, each day another sublime crash of fireworks, another mountain range broken beyond repair. His brilliance blinds, his greatness whirrs in his ears" (54). The godly Johnson is a violent, narcissistic child, a duplicate of early Lowell. The rhyme of crime and sublime is telling. Lowell's sublime enthusiasms were also treated, at least by the police, as criminal. The final draft of "Waking Early Sunday Morning," interestingly, is more a lament for the victims of sublime struggles than an apology for those who initiate them. Lowell mourns the young killed in Vietnam as well as the environmental devastation caused by the war: Pity the planet, all joy gone from this sweet volcanic cone; peace to our children when they fall in small war on the heels of small war - (24) As in conventional elegies, the bereaved poet projects his grief onto the landscape. Lowell, however, diverges from stock tropes in a grandiose way by projecting the normal pastoral decay onto the whole world and cosmos, as if he were an astronaut gazing back on the threatened planet. In his self-aggrandizing way, he becomes the planet - the once sublime, maniacally disruptive volcano that is now empty of joy because "violent idealism" and "pathological enthusiasm" have gutted it. The sublime apotheosis which is also a traditional attri- bute of elegies is undercut by the last image of emptiness, in which poet, president, war dead, ravaged earth, and spacecraft form the compound "ghost / orbiting forever lost / in our monotonous sublime." The last phrase may recall Milton's description of endless wars in the 514 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="20">Abyss of Chaos and Night in Paradise Lost and Baudelaire's description of earth as a small, monotonous "oasis d'horreur dans un desert d'ennui" (188), as Steven Axelrod has pointed out. It also harks back to a criticism made by Randall Jarrell of Lowell's proclivity for gothic sublimities. Jarrell's review of The Mills of the Kavanaughs protests that the nightmarish horrors of the oedipal revery "are only too success- fully nightmarish, so that there is a sort of monotonous violence and extremity about the poem, as if it were a piece of music that consisted of nothing but climaxes" (41-42). Lowell's dense, concluding image of monotonous sublimity in "Waking Early Sunday Morning" is as harshly critical. Lowell is the Lucifer-like astronaut who reflects on his oedipal leaps for sublime power with tragic gloom, and who, like Milton's Satan, is convinced "Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell" (Paradise Lost 4.75) and convinced, too, that he will transplant that hell to the natural paradise of earth. While reviewing Lord Weary's Castle, Jarrell offered similar insights into Lowell's tragic leaps when he pointed out, "Lowell reminds one of those heretical enthusiasts, often disciplined and occasionally sanctified or excommunicated, who are more at home in the Church Triumphant than in the church of this world" (22). He contended that Lowell-the-enthusiast was modeled after a liberal, liberating Christ who was trying to break loose from everything that represented neces- sity, all the established determinants of American history and personal heritage: "everything that is closed, turned inward, incestuous, that blinds or binds: the Old Law, imperialism, militarism, capitalism, Cal- vinism, Authority, the Father, the 'proper Bostonians,' the rich" (19). "Waking Early Sunday Morning" initiates another act in this allegori- cal drama between enthusiastic son and repressive father. What is so distinctive about the poem is its self-reflexive discontent with the agon and its sublime purpose. "I am tired. Everyone's tired of my turmoil," Lowell complained in "Eye and Tooth" (For the Union Dead 19), thinking of the monotonous violence of his enthusiasms. An early draft of "Waking Early Sunday Morning" expresses his dissatisfaction with the poetic correlative of the political and psychological sublime - the rhetorical sublime - with intense candor: "I cannot take it, I am sick / of stretching for the rhetoric / and hammering allegoric splendor" (Williamson 60). The final version in Near the Ocean makes this stylistic critique presidential, so that either Johnson or Kennedy is imagined to be "sick / of his ghost-written rhetoric" (23). Lowell's sexual enthu- siasms, his sense of the erotic sublime, are also projected onto the presi- dents but then mocked: "O to break loose. All life's grandeur / is some- thing with a girl in summer" (23). Similarly, his religious enthusiasms LOWELL 515</page><page sequence="21">for God's grandeur ("When will we see Him face to face?" [19]) are seen for what they are: consequences of pathological oedipal struggles. The Church has been reduced to a mental hospital, its "vanishing / emblems" no longer sublime but "sad, / slight, useless things to calm the mad" (19). During this sustained critique of the psychopathology of the sublime, Lowell cannot free himself of a nostalgia for "dreams of power" (from which he wakes in an early draft of the poem) and the "criminal leisure of a boy" (Williamson 60), who in the later poem in Near the Ocean is the sublime Satan "squatting like a dragon on / time's hoard before the day's begun" (16). Although he admonishes himself to "Stop, back off" (16) and to "Sing softer!" (20), his enchant- ment with sublime power, however criminal or terrifying it may be, makes him chafe against his newly acquired restraints. The opposite of the sublime, Lowell implies, is the opposite of mania: a restless, melancholic narcissism. As a result, his argument seems foredoomed. When he wonders, "But what if a new / diminuendo brings no true / tenderness, only restlessness, / excess, the hunger for success, / sanity of self-deception" (20), he knows that there is really no satisfactory alternative to the excesses of "sublime ambitions." He is like the fish in the early draft, "consciously rising for the bait" (Williamson 60) and soon to be hooked on the sublime. Although he knows his addic- tion to religious, political, poetic, and personal sublimes is pathological, he cannot wholly submit to the sort of rational Protestant sublime that Kant advocated, nor can he rest easy with the sort of domestic, antisublime stances of poets like William Carlos Williams and Elizabeth Bishop, although he tried to copy them. Bishop, he commented in an uncollected poem, was "Unable to . . . live / Our usual roaring sublime" (Hamilton 135). The roaring lion refers to the Atlantic Ocean's waves. (In Bishop's late poem "The End of March," only the lion's prints remain on the Atlantic's shore; the sublime poet - the "lion- sun"-is absent.) Another uncollected poem, entitled "Soliloquy," casts Bishop more firmly in the role of sublime poet, although it still emphasizes her sane resistance to extremism. She is made to admit, "Wholly Atlantic, though half fugitive / From Nova Scotia, I have tried to live / Our country's egotistical sublime" (Houghton 2238). Lowell's "pathog- raphies" of other poets-of Randall Jarrell, who was "Once so sub- limely far from the sublime" (Houghton 2764) but in the end submitted to its enchantment and committed suicide, and of John Berryman, who was obsessed with "The autobiographical sublime" (Houghton 516 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="22">2701) and suffered a similar fate - reveal the sort of narcissistic drive toward death that Bishop's egotistical sublime flirted with and in the end opposed. That she failed to live the sublime is, paradoxically, a triumph; it indicates an enviable temperament disinclined to wallow in the sort of excesses that Lowell and his male cohorts found so irresistible. Like Ahab on his quest for the godly whale, Lowell was destined to pitch and falter on the sea of his manic-depressive talent. He resembles the chinook salmon "stopped by ten / steps of the roaring ladder" in "Waking Early Sunday Morning," finally achieving sublime transcendence in the teeth of overpowering adversities and also doomed to make the self-destructive return to the "roaring Atlantic." If he was heroic he could also be vicious, sad, and ridiculous, a tragicomic char- acter arousing pity, terror, and laughter. Determined by the "kingdom of necessity," either by law or nature, his conduct was bound to an ineluctable cycle of mania, depression, and creative atonement. With his usual astuteness, Randall Jarrell pointed out that Lowell's mind was "so traditional, theocentric, and anthropomorphic that no images from the sciences, next to none from philosophy, occur in his poems." Rather playfully, he observed, "Bodily Changes in Fear, Pain and Hunger may let the poet know more about the anger of Achilles, but it is hard for him to have to talk about adrenalin and the thalamus" (25-26). While Jarrell was speaking of Lord Weary's Castle, his obser- vation holds true for most of Lowell's work. Lowell knew that his mania was caused by a combination of environmental and chemical factors. Near the end of his life, when lithium was prescribed and, unlike the phenothiazine drugs he had previously taken, began to control his manic-depression without too many deleterious side effects, he would tell friends that all his past problems were simply caused by a lack of salt in his brain. If he had wanted, he could have specu- lated that his psychopathological sublimities or pathological enthu- siasms resulted from norepinephrine or other chemical transmitter sub- stances generating barrages of nerve impulses along the synapses. A year after Lowell began taking lithium, the psychiatrist Mogens Schou published his "Special Review of Lithium in Psychiatric Therapy and Prophylaxis" (1968), which revealed that little was actually known "about the biological disturbance underlying manic-depressive dis- order." Nevertheless, Schou wrote, "Much speculation has centered around the role of monoamines in affective disorders, and recent studies disclose an interference of lithium and monoamine metabolism and the activity of monoamine neurons in the brain. . . . These data LOWELL 517</page><page sequence="23">suggest that lithium may decrease noradrenaline levels at the receptor sites" (387). Rather than choose for his personae biogenic amines and lithium salts and construct a psychodrama out of chemical antagonists, Lowell usually drew on the Freudian model, since it focused on the sort of wrenching family relations he was all too familiar with. Obsessed with history, myth, religion, and literature rather than neurology, Lowell consistently investigated the causes and conse- quences of sublime enthusiasms in a way that was confessional but at the same time cultural. His pantheon of heroic sinners and tragic saints, on one level, comprises a psychopathology of the sublime that offers up both culpable self and masked other for relentless judgment.
