<plain_text><page sequence="1">WESTERN INFLUENCE ON NEHRÜ'S PÓLlflCAL IDEAŠ By R.R. Parihar* I It is being increasingly and perhaps rightly recognised that political ideas do not and cannot evolve in a social vacuum. They are inspired by and can germinate, sprout and blossom generally in the socio-economic soil of a given epoch of human history. As a matter of fact no 'political thinker whether he be an earthly pragmatist or a sky-roving idealist can altogether transcend his contemporary environment. Who can, for instance, deny that Plato's Republic despite all its generally acknowledged and juicy idealism, is in its essence, a brilliant philosophical analysis and an implicit solution for the salvation of an Athens gone neckdeep into the swirling flood waters of a perpetual political strife and a near social chaos?1 The political theory of Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau and Hegel, to take at random, a few luminaries in the firmament of European political philosophy, is in its ultimate analysis both a product of and a reaction to the specific conditions and burning issues of their respective period. Like- wise, the political ideas of Jawaharlal Nehru are in no way exempt from the impact of his times. And what is more, in his case, a complex global environment, essentially the product of modern science and technology has very effectively impigned and continues to impign on his keenly sensitive, pragmatic and electic mind. Somewhat in the manner of the confluence of the Ganges and the Jamuna near his home town Allahabad, there converge and flow in his oceanic mind the profound ideological currents of the West and the East. In his inimitable and forthright way he states. "I have become a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home no where. Perhaps my thought and approach to life aremore akin to what is called Western than Eastern, but India clings to me as she does to all her children, in innumerable ways and behind me lie somewhere, in the sub-conscious, racial memories of a hundred, or whatever the number may be, gene rations of Brahmins.

It is based on actual conditions The Republic is not only a deduction from first principles : it is also an induction from facts of Greek life (Italic mine). 83</page><page sequence="2">84 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE or my recent acquisition... I am a stranger and alien in the West. I cannot be of it. But in my own country also, sometimes, I have an exile's feeling."2 According to an eminent author "there are many strands in the temperament, character and intellectual calibre of Nehru, derived from India and Europe, which makes his personality rather like a rich tapestry than like a home-spun fabric which many of his more simple followers imagine him to be." Continuing the metaphor, he adds "As the weaver of the tapestry happens to be Jawaharlal himself and the bobbins are moved from one colour to another inside him, the onlookers can only admire the cloth and make wild guesses about the inner links "3 II In an assessment of the Western influence on Nehru's Political ideas, Harrow and Cambridge have traditionally occupied the foremost place. What and how much of a legacy have they left on his thought pattern and what if any have they secreted to the substance thereof? Of course, Nehru himself traces the beginnings of his interest in socialism to his Cambridge days when the Fabianism of Shaw and the Webbs attracted him but he confesses that his interest was rather academic at that stage.4 He became 'vaguely attracted to the Fabians and socialistic ideas.'5 "They were vague socialistic ideas more humanitarian and Utopian than scientific."6 Two years at Harrow (Christmas term of 1905 to the end of Summer term of 1907) were followed by a course of Natural Sciences Tripos in Chemistry, Geology, and Botany, with a second class Honours degree - brought him into a voluntary intellectual contacts with Shaw's Prefaces and Major Barbara , H.G. Wells A Modern Utopia , writings of Lowes Dickinson and Meredith and Townsend's Asia and Europe , the last three particularly impressed him and influenced the pattern of his political thought.7 A favourite of his during the war years and after was Bertrand Russell.8 There, his chief 'acquisitions' appear to have been a scientific outlook, a lucid straight forward, well-chiselled English expression, perhaps in a large measure the effect of a study of a tripos in Natural Sciences, and a strong sceptic and agnostic inclination ; in short a scientific methodology, a set of tools for thought rather than a rich corpus of thought itself. And it is this scientific outlook which forms the substratum of all his ideas and acts, and the sheet-anchor of all that he stands for. 2 Jawaharlal Nehru, An Autobiography (1958), p. 596, K.T.

During the days of individual Satyagraha in 1940, when Nehru's arrest was almost a foregone conclusion, he came to Sevagram to see Mahatma Gandhi. As he was about to leave, Kasturba the wife of Mahatma Gandhi blessed Nehru and said to him "God will look after you." He turned with a smile and said "Where is God, Ba? If He exists, He must be very fast asleep."9 Whatever the paternal contribution to his agnosticism it is essentially a phenomenon of Western Science. Accordingly it arises from his distrust of all metaphysical subleties. He is indeed incapable of thinking of Deity in anthropomorphic terms. He describes as odd the idea of a personal God, although he has been recently somewhat fascinated by the precepts of Vedanta, an ancient system of Indian philosophy but stripped of its purely metaphysical and religious beliefs.10 He says : "Religion as I saw it preached and accepted even by thinking minds, whether in Hinduism or Islam or Buddhism or Christianity did not attract me. It seemed to be closely associated with supersti- tious and dogmatic beliefs and behind it lay a method of approach to life's problems which was not certainly that of science yet is was obvious that religion had supplied some deeply |felt inner urge of human nature".11 A part of the legacy at Harrow and Cambridge, has been his 'vague kind of cyrenaicism, partly natural to youth, partly to the influence of Oscar Wilde and Walterpater. "It is easy and gratifying to give a long Greek name to the desire for a soft life and pleasant experiences...... I enjoyed life and I refused to see why I should consider it a thing of sin."12 But it is important to remember that this cyrenaic element has been enriched by his love for adventure, faith in man, and a high consideration for the good of others. He has believed in a full-blooded life remniscient of the Faustian Western man, but this in his case has been qualified strongly by his avoidance of vulgar aristocratic bourgeosie living at the sheer animalistic level. Like-wise, he does not approve of the Vedantic Buddhist idea of self-abnegation and self-mortification, notwithstanding the fact that he is considerably fascinated by their ethics.13 Logically enough, there is much that overlaps in the three ingrediants namely objective outlook, agnosticism and cyrenaicism, and that supports and nourishes them alike. 9 A Study of Nehru , pp. 139-40. 10 Michael Brecher: Nehru , A Political Biography , p. 231. 11 Discovery of India (1961), p. 26. 12 An Autobiography, p. 20. 13 V P.

They appear to vie with each other for an exclusive possession of Nehru's allegiance. The Fabian abhorrence of violent methods, its unshakable attachment to the democratic processes for the attainment of an equipt able and just social order, and in some degree, its theory of the inevitability of gradualism have had their appeal to him.14 The norms of this humanist liberal tradition have stooped to conquer him and the conquest is irrevocably complete. But, nor he has escaped the opposite pull of Marxist analysis. He has felt himself drawn to each and swayed between the two. Notwithstanding his unqualified rejection of the violent methods, he has been uniformly enchanted by the Marxist doctrine of economic determinism, the economic interpretation of history. "Russia apart" he writes "the theory and philosophy of Marxism lightened up many a dark corner of my mind. History came to have a new meaning for me. The marxist interpretation threw a flood of light on it.... It was the essential freedom from dogma and the scientific outlook of Marxism that appealed to me.15" About a decade later, he states in still clearer terms. "A Study of Marx and Lenin produced a powerful effect on my mind and helped me to see history and current affairs in a new light. Much in the Marxist philosophical outlook, I could accept without difficulty, its monism, and non-duality of mind and matter, the dynamics of matter, the dialectics of continuous change by evolution as well as leap, through action and interaction, cause and effect, thesis and anti-thesis and synthesis. It did not satisfy me completely, nor did it answer all the questions in my mind and almost unawares a vague idealistic approach would creepe into my mind something rather akin to the Vedantic approach".16 Indeed the marxist approach to History forms the scaffolding for many a chapter in his Autobiography particularly those relating to the contemporary Indian agrarian, and economic scenes and of Glimpses of World History almost in its entirety. In Discovery of India , his much later work than the other two, the approach is multilinear and the author's mind appears to plumb deeper and tçnd in an ethico-spiritual direction.17 Nevertheless one can easily find in his works an affinity of treatment between Nehru's related pages and 'the Uncannily prophetic utterances of Marx* in the letters about India written to the New York Herald Tribune, in 1853, bearing on the theme of exploitation involved in the British rule 14 Moraes, op, cit . p.42. 15 An Autobiography , pp. 362-63. 16 The Discovery of India , pp. 29-30. 17 Zakaria, op . cit. pp 352-53«</page><page sequence="5">WBSTERN INFLUENCB ON NEHRU'S POLITICAL IDEAS 87 over India. As a matter of fact, Dr. Mulk Raj Anand describes Nehru's aforesaid literary efforts as an enrichment of the sketchy treatment of the subject by Marx.18 The affinity is not inexplicable when regard be had to the fact that 'like most socialist intellectuals of his age, he appears to accept the theory that means of production change consciousness as a fair yardstick for judging the major movements of history.'19 Understandably enough, in his analysis of rise of fascism in Italy, of Nazism in Germany, economic depression of 193 ' the Manchurian crisis, the fascist aggression on Abyssinia, the Spanish Civil War, and the Nazi rapes of Austria and Czechoslovakia, his pole star is the Marxist Methodology.20 About the World economic depression, he himself writes : 'The great world crisis seemed to justify the Marxist analysis. While all other systems and theories were groping about in the dark, Marxism alone explained it more or less satisfactorily and offered a real solution.'21 Of the two Western influences, Nehru's allegiance to the socialist democratic ideal is greater and almost uncritical. He whole-heartedly endorses its goals and the avenues of approach thereto. On the other hand, his appreciation of Marxism is conditional, qualified and fractional. He approves of its goal, a classless society and analysis but would not touch its violent techniques even with a pair of tongs. So, as between the two, he has unhesitatingly selected democratic socialism. But as between fascism and Marxism, he prefers the latter. As he say : "As between fascism and communism my sympathies are entirely with communism. As these pages will reveal, I am far from being a communist. My roots are still perhaps in the nineteenth century and I have been too much influenced by {the humanist liberal tradition to get out of it completely. I dislike dogma and the treatment of Karl Marx's writings or any other books as revealed scriptures which cannot be challenged.... But I still incline more and more towards a communist philosophy"22 Do these influences still persist in his thought. Contrary to the leftist criticism23 that the Nehru has moved considerably to the right, a perusal of his parliamentary and public speeches (the latter as reported in is Ibid, p. 351. 1« Ibid. so Letters Nos. 175, 178, 184, 185, 189 and 190 in Glimpses of World History (1962). 21 An Autobiography, p. 363. 22 Ibid , p. 591. 23 Typical, though unusually polite criticism irom the communist standpoint, is, for instance, that of academician Yudin under the title 'Can we accept Pandit Nehru's Approach ?' published in World Marxist Review, Vol . I, No.4, December, 1958, included in toto by Dr. Sampuranand in his Indian Socialism, pp. 80-1 13. 24 ««We have said that our objective is a socialist pattern of society. I do no propose to define precisely that socialism in tbis context because we wish to avoid any rigid or doctrinaire thinking." Speeches, 1953 - 57, p. 96,</page><page sequence="6">88 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE the press) does not warrant such a conclusion.24 Only a few years back, Nehru, again, stated : 'I believe moreand more in socialism. More and more even in some facts of communism, not to the action but the theory part of it; a communistsociety somewhere in the future. But I always condition it that the methods should be peaceful, broadly speaking peaceful and not wrong.25 At the Avadi session of the Congress party, his was the major initiative in putting through the thesis of a socialist pattern of society for India, and at the subsequent A. I. C. C. seminar at Ooty, its elaboration by his party could not have taken place without his consent. There is, at any rate, little evidence to hold, with some of his critics, that his attachment to democratic socialism and the allied humanist tradition has waned as his political power has waxed. The truth, indeed seems to be that it persists with a striking vitality. IV Perhaps, in no way second to any other of the Western strands in Nehru's political ideas, and indeed the most inspiring and prior of them all, is his passionate attachment and allegiance to the concept of nationalism. Over half a century of his active public life is coextensive with the rise and growth of nationalism in Asia and Africa. The brilliant nationalist exploits of Mazzini and Garibaldi, their inspiring nationalist writings, the adventurous course of the Sinn Fein in Ireland, and the carving of a secular nation state in Turkey by Mustafa Kemal in the early twenties of this century appear to have made deep impressions on Nehru's mind.26 One of the very powerful ideological forces of the century, nationalism- has initially affected Nehru's thinking, primarily as a reaction against foreign rule, such as it has done in the whole of the East. Evolving through two epoch making European movements - Renaissance and Reformation - the Western nationalism has recently developed two broadly distinct traditions : Nationalism anchored to the liberal humanitarian tradition and the one steeped in fascist manifestations. It is hardly neces- sary to point out that it is the former which Nehru has adopted and seeks to adapt to the genius of his country.27 It is this liberal humanitarian aspect of Western nationalism which is one of the effective determinants of his success in preventing a religious or racial revivalism in this land and the Indian people getting deflected into the bottomless abyss of communal hatreds and racial frenzy of a pluralist civilization.28 To him, it appears, this approach offers also the widest possible denominator for the medley of castes, creeds and cultures of the Indian sub-continent. 26 Tibor Mende : Conversations with Mr. Nehru ( 1956). dd. 31-32. 26 An Autobiography, pp. 19, 25. 27 M.

And what is more, Nehru has sought to integrate it with internationalism. He has endeavoured to adapt one to the other, the modern 'polis' to the no less modern 'cosmopolis'31 Nehru is one of the greatest internationalists of this age. In his case, internationalist thought is only a concomitant of his nationalist idea. While it is only plausible that in his combination of the philosophy of nationalism with that of cosmopolitanism or universalism, the Western influence has had its contribution, he traces the ideology of internationalism in three of the greatest Indians of modern times, Vivekananda, Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi.32 In the ultimate analysis, it so appears that irrespective of whether the dominant urge to internationalism comes from the West or the East the collective interests and safety of mankind matter a great deal to him, remaining one of the very significant focii of his internationalist thought. V Closely akin to his internationalist thought, and stemming directly from it, is Nehru's thinking on the associated concepts of war, peace and diplomacy. Herein, too, the general tenor of his approach is pragmatic and eclectic. Unlike Machiavelli, peace to Nehru is no mere interval between two wars, in which a shrewd statesman prepares for the next trial of conclusions with his enemy, nor is war, just a continuation of diplomacy by other means as the traditional diplomatic thinking on the subject under- stands it to be. His is the Gandhian or Russellian concept of peace, a peace based on recognition of mutual interests of mankind, and not merely a so-called armed peace. It may be noticed here that as in the case of his integration of the nationalist with the internationalist ideas, so also in the domain of thought on world peace, Nehru's inspiration is multiple, owing itself to the Western no less than Eastern strands. As regards the two great traditions in Western 29 An Autobiography p. 80. 80 Varma, op, cit , p. 585. 81 "When we talked of the independence of India it was not in terms of isolation. We realized, perhaps more than many other countries that the old type of complete national independence was doomed, and there must be a new era of world co-operation, we made it repeatedly clear, therefore, that we were perfectly agreeable to limit that independence in common with other nations, within some international frame work.

To Machiavelli ends justified the means. To Nehru - and here he is deeply indebted to Mahatma Gandhi - ethical purity of means is no less vital than the moral quality of the objectives.83 Stated in a nut shell, Nehru's idea of peace, war and diplomacy despite its initial inspiration lying outside himself has received an enrichment of substance and fullness of expression markedly reflective of his dynamic individuality. VI While it is somewhat out of place to import an analysis of the Eastern and other elements in an appraisal of the Westeren influences on his politi- cal ideas, it is also incorrect to treat the Indian thinkers' mind asa mere inert repository of diverse influences. Indeed., it seems highly desirable to point out that the Western and other elements do not lie simply heaped up there in a condition of a passive co-existence as objects in a museum but that, in reality, they have often acted and re-acted upon and stimulated one another and brought into existence a complex synthesis. At places, the Western influences appear to have undergone, as it were, a sea change as they have had to operate against an Indian or a still wider Asian back- ground. If Nehru has been nourished and considerably nurtured by the intellectual currents of the West, he has no less heavily drunk from the honey-jugs of Gandhism and even, for that matter, the entire fountain of Eastern humanism.34 Finally, it is important to remember that if Nehru's mind be compared to a sort of parallelogram of socio-economic forces, and admitting that the two strong currents thereof are the Western and the Eastern, the resultant diagonal is not exclusively due to the two. A third force, as it were, is also operative in the process, the Indian thinker's own creative mind.35 33 Nehru's Speeches 1946-49, p. 302. 34 Beecher, op . cit., pp. 231-33. 35 Das, op. cit ., p. 10.</page></plain_text>
