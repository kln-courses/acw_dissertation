<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW OF BOOKS 327 David Stern, Parables in Midrash. Narrative and Exegesis in Rabbinic Literature, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 1991, 347 pp. ISBN 0-674-65447-1. Despite the intimidating title, promising to cover four enormous sub jects, "parables", "midrash", "narrative", and "exegesis", the work in fact is a revised dissertation, with the strengths and weaknesses of the genre. It is compendious and very well researched; it contains a large number of interesting observations of detail. But it is more of a collection of information and opinions on a number of topics than a well-argued, thoughtfully-crafted statement of a particular proposition on the general theme at hand. The bridge from the detail to the main point proves shaky. The result is an occasionally-interesting but rather prolix and unfocussed work, a bit pretentiously claiming to accomplish more than is actually achieved, but, still, valuable for what in fact is given. Dealing with the mashal as it occurs in two dozen passages in Lamenta tions Rabbah, which are given in an appendix in the Hebrew texts in two recensions and in translation as well, the monograph, on the strength of which its author gained a tenured professorship at the University of Penn sylvania, deals with these topics: composition and exegesis, rhetoric, poetics, thematics, the mashal in context, and the mashal in Hebrew literature. The mashal, though represented by a remarkably tiny sample, is treated uniform, the representations of the form in various, diverse documents not being differentiated; so too "midrash" is treated as every where the same thing, being defined as "the study and interpretation of Scripture by the Rabbis in Late Antiquity". Consequently, the contem porary tools of form-analysis and criticism, on the one side, and of the systematic differentiation of documents by their indicative traits of rhetoric, topic, and logic of coherence, on the other, are denied the author. The result is a rather general and unanalytical treatment of the subject. But that does not deny the book a hearing, since the author pro vides a full, though somewhat repetitious, account of the scholarly literature and problems, and his treatment of the texts he discusses, if a bit prolix, contains interesting ad hoc observations. A brief survey of the main points yields sound reason to value the book. Composition and exegesis: the mashal or parable is to be distinguised from a fable: "a fable utilizes anthropomorphic animals or plants to por tray the particularly theriomorphic or phylomorphic features of human behavior. A parable suggests a sort of parallels between an imagined fic tional event and an immediate, 'real' situation confronting the parable's author and his audience." Parables in rabbinic literature are "preserved not in narrative contexts but in exegetical one, as part of midrash...

Brill, Leiden</page><page sequence="2">328 REVIEW OF BOOKS midrashim of verses". Parables are to be distinguished from allegories, on the one side, and the ma'aseh, or precedent ("example or exemplum, an anecdote told to exemplify or illustrate a lesson"). While Stern concedes that the explanation that accompanies the narrative of the mashal, called the nimshal, first occurs only in Medieval documents, he includes in his discussion a full account of that quite distinct, late development. Indeed, much of the chapter on poetics invokes the nimshal, so we are asked to understand rabbinic literature of late antiquity only be appeal to literary forms not found in the writings of late antiquity, a rather confusing mode of analysis. Rhetoric: the occasions of the mashal are spelled out. The mashal serves for three purposes: illustration, "secret speech", and "rhetorical narrative". Stern sees the mashal as "a story that turns allusiveness to effect in order to persuade its audience of the value of a certain idea or approach or feeling". The key word here is "allusiveness", which Stern does not define with clarity. Poetics: the center of the book is the interest in "the relationship between exegesis and narrative". "The Rabbinic mashal can be defined as a parabolic narrative that claims to be exegesis and serves the purposes of ideology". That definition would prove more compelling if it did not serve equally well a variety of other forms in the rabbinic literature. Much of the rest of the discussion concerns the nimshal, as I said, leaving open a variety of questions concerning the mashal in late antiquity. But the results are not wholly without interest. Stern's most interesting point is this: "among the most distinctive characteristics of the mashal's poetics is the strategically placed point of discontinuity, technically called a gap". Much of the exposition, alas, proceeds to "disparities between narrative and nimshal", leaving us once more somewhat puzzled as to Sern's pro gram. Lamentations Rabbah is not a medieval document, but much of the exposition of the data spills over into the consideration of kinds of mashal writing that came to the surface much later than that document; that presents a considerable puzzle, if we want to grasp precisely what Stern wishes to say, indeed, even to define that about which he is writing; some times late antique writing, sometimes medieval; sometimes, indeed, the mashal in particular, other times Midrash in general. Indeed, the confusion is intensified by recurring efforts to define the mashal, each fabricated for its context, thus, later in the same chapter, "the mashal is essentially mimetic narrative. It is about events and char acters, and particularly one character—the king, or God. Beyond all else, the mashal represents the greatest effort to imagine God in all Rabbinic literature". That definition bears more enthusiasm than enlightenment, since the conception that the "king" in the mashal means "God" in par ticular relies upon the particular cases at hand; the point is not so much demonstrated as alleged with gusto.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF BOOKS 329 Thematics: "the midrashic mashal is a type of ideological narrative, which seeks to impress the truth and validity of a world-view .. upon its audience. In any particular mashal, that world-view is refracted within the mashal's specific message, its theme or thesis". This new definition would prove more useful if—once again—it did not define equally well every other type of writing in rabbinic literature. Thus the chapter treats, further, "apologetics, polemics, eulogy and consolation, complaint, regret and warning", and on and on; that is, various mashals are classified in various ways. None of the classifications encompasses only the mashal, so the results are indeterminate and again somewhat puzzling. The Mashal in context: "in their seemingly haphazard positions in these collections [Talmud, Midrash], the meshalim are no different from the rest of the contents. The structure and composition of these documents are famously difficult to identify. Despite a few recent attempts to demon strate the 'integrity'—the formal and thematic coherence—of the various midrashic collections, they remain to all appearances more like anthologies of traditional Rabbinic interpretations that an anonymous editor has selected and recorded than like self-contained, logically struc tured books in their own right". Stern thus does not then see any dif ferences of a general character between, e.g., Sifra and Leviticus Rabbah, both on Leviticus; or the Tosefta and the Talmud of the Land of Israel, both on the Mishnah. This awry view makes difficult for him the deter mination of the context in which the mashal does, or does not, occur, why here, not there, being questions that, by definition, he finds he cannot answer. That further accounts for his difficulty in seeing formal dif ferences in the mashal as it occurs in the several distinct documents. So he concedes at the outset, "the 'contextual' interpretation of midrash— reading a midrashic passage in its literary, documentary context—is a very problematic venture. The larger literary units that we most comfor tably use in reading and interpreting the meaning of literary works—the document as a whole, chapters, even subsections in chapters or discrete narrative or legal sections in a work like the Bible—do not constitute significant units of meaning for midrash". That explains why Stern sees the units as "fragmentary, miscellaneous, and atomistic". Other views of the documentary character of the rabbinic corpus are not examined, and the remainder of the chapter replicates in detail the deeply confused character of Stern's reading of the whole. That makes all the more regrettable Stern's failure to understand his own results. After a systematic study, he concludes, "The passages just discussed all show how midrashic discourse is organized: in recognizable units of discourse, in literary forms like the petihta, the mashal, the enumeration, the series. These forms comprise the genres or</page><page sequence="4">330 REVIEW OF BOOKS subgenres of midrash. They constitute its language, and they maintain themselves in midrashic literature formally and rhetorically, even when they combine with one another. The combinatory pattern of these units is essentially additive. The petihta-form provides a frame for the mashal, which in turn is made to serve the special rhetoric of the petihta; but neither form is required to surrender its distinctive structure or formal identity when it joins with the other. Similarly, a mashal can be con structed in the image of an agadic narrative or ma'aseh, with its own lesson or homily, but it can simultaneously be imployed so as to exploit its own parabolic strengths as a paradigmatic, representational nar rative". Quite what Stern means to say is not entirely clear ("com binatory ... additive..."?), but the main point is precisely that of form analysis: (1) there are fixed forms, (2) they do govern, and (3) they charac terize one kind of writing, rather than some other. Having produced exactly the results that form-analysis of documents has yielded, Stern is left unable to explain his own data. That is because he has not come to grips with the position he rejects without discussion, quite out of hand, that documents make a difference. Once he has declared the literature chaotic, he cannot recognize the points of order he himself identifies. The concluding chapter, "The Mashal in Hebrew literature", need not detain us, since it is tacked on dissertation-style, to cover whatever might have been left out in the substantive chapters. The strengths of Stern's dissertation are his own. They lie in his ad hoc observations about this and that. In his rambling, sometimes unfocussed discussions of the specific passages in Lamentations Rabbah he has chosen to discuss in detail, he makes numerous interesting and some compelling observations. Though this is not a work of mature scholarship, it is more than a mere collection and arrangement of information, and we may hope for better things to come from its author. The weaknesses of the disserta tion are those of the genre; Stern proves a good graduate student, thorough in compiling opinions on various topics, but embarrassingly selective in dealing with published results that the author does not wish to address at all. He covers a broad range of subjects, but has not got a well-crafted thesis to present to make the topical program cohere and form an important proposition and thesis upon a well-crafted problem. So the work is at the same time too general and rambling and altogether too specific, not bridging the gap between the detail and the main point. As a dissertation it certainly is above average; as an account of the parable, this overweight book is more encyclopaedic than interesting. Jacob Neusner</page></plain_text>
