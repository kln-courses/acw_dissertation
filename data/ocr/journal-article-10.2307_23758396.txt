<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LIFE OF THE ANT. By Maurice Maeterlinck, John Day Co., New York, 1930. $2.50. It is well known that Mr. Maeterlinck is a novelist and playwright rather than a scien tist, and yet he writes charmingly upon many phases of nature. This volume is the result of his general interest in insect life. It is evident from a reading of the text, that Mr. Maeter linck did not make any great number of obser vations himself, but rather that he collected the results of experimentations, opinions, and con clusions of others who did employ experimental methods. It is a book by one who is interested in, rather than an expert in, the natural sciences. The work can hardly be called technical, nor does the author so intend it, and those who are looking for a close application of strictly scien tific principles, will be disappointed, for it is written in popular style, interspersed at every point with philosophy and applications to our human society. However it does contain a very large amount of scientific information. Such words as mind, thought, foresight, sympathy, joy, laziness, idea, etc., are used in a highly anthropomorphic sense. It seems extremely doubtful whether such words can be logically applied to an organism as lowly as an ant, a fact which the author himself senses, for he speaks of it in an early chapter. On the whole the book is interesting and will repay anyone, scientist or layman, for the time spent upon it. Incidentally, it furnishes the author with a vehicle for the happy expression of his many philosophies. Edwin E. Jacobs</page></plain_text>
