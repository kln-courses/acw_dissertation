<plain_text><page sequence="1">POUNEH SAEEDI FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US Résumé : L'essai qui suit met en lumière l'importance de la représentation des femmes dans le film The Wind Will Carry Us (1999) du réalisateur Iranien Abbas Kiarostami. L'étude soutient l'idée que les personnages féminins, peu nombreux, ont un impact sur la transformation du personnage principal, Behzad, que l'on nomme, avec déférence, "l'ingénieur". Dans son affection pour la poésie, il manifeste déjà une ouverture pour l'adoption de nouvelles perspectives face à la vie. De surcroît, le film fait un tableau de l'écriture féminine dans sa circularité, dans sa répugnance à l'achèvement, son accen tuation de la beauté de la vie. La poésie, disséminée dans le récit, souligne l'importance de "l'écriture féminine" qui, avec l'accent qu'elle met sur la vie, mène Behzad, qui était initialement obsédé par la mort, à recouvrer l'appréciation de ses beautés multiformes. One of the criticisms leveled at Iranian director, Abbas Kiarostami, especially prior to the release of the female-dominated movie Ten [Dah, 2002) and Copie conforme (2010), has been the perceptible absence of female characters. One need only watch his internationally-acclaimed movies including Where is the Friend's Home? (Khaneyi doost kojastl, 1987) and Taste of Cherry (Ta'm-i Gilaas, 1997) to concur with film critic Negar Mottahedeh's observation that "woman is what is subtracted from the screen in [Kiarostami's] oeuvre. Yet, as shall be argued in this paper, the spectators cannot but help feel the presence of women within the interstices of the filmic narrative, even in their absence. More than the corporeal presence of women in these films, female figurations manifest them selves in a filmic portrayal of what Hélène Cixous calls écriture feminine: a mode of writing that disrupts patriarchal master narratives of linearity as it opts for potentially more nuanced and lively circular performances.2 This paper seeks to deconstruct female figurations in The Wind Will Carry Us (1999), not only with regard to women's absent presence, but also in terms of the feminine elements embedded in the plot that lead to a pictorial projection of écriture feminine. Consequently, sensual experience is prioritized over a linear and logo-centric form of expression as a means of moving through the continuum of time and space, only to ultimately find a way out of the spatio-temporal constraints of life in an appreciation for the cycle of life and the intensity of the moments it presents to us. Female writing, as shall be seen, does not confine itself to the depiction of the sights and sounds of women who present themselves in the course of the CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FILM STUDIES • REVUE CANADIENNE D'ÉTUDES CINÉMATOGRAPHIQUES VOLUME 22 NO. 2 • FALL • AUTOMNE 2013 • pp 81-96</page><page sequence="2">plot, but pulsates in the poesis of the film itself, which reaches a crescendo in the poetic voice of one of the greatest of all poets, Forugh Farrokhzâd—known as simply Forugh, among Iranians. Prior to tackling the artistic delicacies of 'feminine writing' and its manifes tations in The Wind Will Carry Us, it would be useful to explore the thrust of the film's narrative, namely, the desire for death, the death of a woman.3 Despite being initially wrapped up in a cloak of mystery, the purpose behind the trip embarked upon by an all-male crew of filmmakers headed by Behzad Dorrani (who is referred to as mohandes or "engineer") to the remote village of Siyah Darreh in the strife-torn Kurdistan province is shortly unveiled: the filming of the funeral of the matriarch of the village, Maliheh Malik.4 Although shocking to most viewers, the burning desire for the death of a woman has proven to be a leitmo tif in a number of Persian literary texts.5 That a woman is both the "telos and the origin" of many an ambitious jour ney embarked upon by an adventurous male is, however, not a theme confined to the sphere of the Orient. Teresa de Lauretis exemplifies the rootedness of every creative construction of the male artist in the desire for the female Other in an allegory taken from Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, which recounts how men constructed a city named Zobeide with the aim of capturing an elusive female figure who had appeared to them naked with long hair, only to find no trace of her whatsoever: [W]oman is both the source of the drive to represent and its ultimate, unat tainable goal. Thus the city, which is built to capture men's dream, finally only inscribes woman's absence...The work of building and rebuilding the city, in a continuing movement of objectification and alienation, is Calvino's metaphor for human history as semiotic productivity [of which] woman— the dream woman—is both telos and origin.6 What is different in the case of a woman being "both the telos and origin" in The Wind Will Carry Us, when considering the association of artistic desire with the female figure, is that the desire is not for the attainment, but for the death of a woman; for that matter, an old woman whose hair and nakedness play no role in propelling the narrative. It is only later that we learn that the import of the matriarch's death in Siyah Darreh has to do with Behzad's fascination with a process known as "scarification" in which local women vie with one another to claim closeness to the deceased by scarring themselves—supposedly as a gesture of grief—so as to please the surviving members of the family. The women, at times, have mercenary objectives in mind, although one wonders why the wives of working men need to feign such immeasurable grief. The village teacher explains to Behzad that they do it so that their husbands may be entitled to a promotion. He also says that while a spectacle of pleasure for the outsiders, "scarification" is regarded as a source of pain for the villagers themselves. In view of De Lauretis's citation, I find it worth noting that the name Zobeide is also that of the epitome of a desiring and doomed woman of the 82 POUNEH SAEEDI</page><page sequence="3">Orient. King Shahriar's adulterous wife in One Thousand and One Nights, Zobeide finds no alternative but to take her own life, yet, her husband Shahriar lives on in the hyper-masculine function of kingship despite taking the lives of numerous women in the wake of his mistrust for womankind. It is only Shahrzad who manages to temper Shahriar's misogyny and murderous streak through the recounting of endless stories that keep not only the king amused, but that also keep herself alive. Although most likely Kiarostami had neither Zobeide nor Shahrzad in mind when directing The Wind Will Carry Us, De Lauretis's analogy still holds true, as at the heart of Kiarostami's film lies an appreciation for poesis and a narrative mingled with feminine beauty, albeit, in its veiled form. Indeed, the ramifications of the veiled-ness of the female characters do not only inform the aesthetics of this film, but have arguably led Iranian movie-makers to develop certain techniques both on narratological and visual levels that set Iranian movies apart from those made elsewhere.7 The dynamics of the male gaze elaborated in great detail by Laura Mulvey in her groundbreaking essay "Visual Pleasures and Narrative Cinema" do not quite operate in post-revolution Iran as the veil serves as a barrier to the fulfillment of scopophilic desires. As Mottahedeh maintains: "The ever-presence of the veil reflexively points to, addresses in fact, the presence everywhere of an unrelated male viewer in the film theatre. The veil meets his look, and foregrounds in this way the looked-at-ness of the film itself"8 and, consequently, the "male spectator's look on a non-familial female body cannot be a gesture of voyeurism."9 However, in the darkened frame of the famous cellar scene of The Wind Will Cany Us, while the veil serves as a visual barrier to Behzad before the sixteen-year-old Zeynab, it in no way keeps the male spectator's scopophilia at bay. In fact, the dynamics of desire in this controversial cellar scene can be compared to the mechanics involved in the use of a "perforated sheet" in Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children. In this novel, the blind but wealthy landowner, Ghani, insists that the sheet be used in the medical examination of the body of his daughter, Naseem, by the young Dr. Aadam Aziz in a bid to maintain "modesty," but perhaps also to kindle the young doctor's desire for her. This is precisely what happens as years later the doctor's grandson Saleem Sinai recounts the incident: "In short: My grandfather had fallen in love, and had come to think of the perforated sheet as something sacred and magical, because through it he had seen things which had filled up the hole inside him."10 The veil has the potential to serve as "something sacred and magical" to the prying and inquisitive eyes of the three kinds of gazes at work in the world of cinema: that of the camera, the male actor, and the specta tor. The veil constitutes part of what Hamid Dabashi paradoxically refers to as the "creative barrier" that "filmmakers have to cross"11 and enhances the libido sciendi of the male imagination. Interestingly, Zeynab foils any attempt at the ful fillment of scopic desire, and against the reciting of the lyrics of the renowned female poet, Forugh Farrokhzâd, the dominance of both aural and oral pleasures prevail instead. The cellar scene is so controversial that it has been referred to as "one of the most violent rape scenes in all cinema,"12 an interpretation that I am disinclined FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US 8J</page><page sequence="4">, J A \ ~v ' U, " M, ' I . 'Hi, - »- i Zeynab milks the cow in the dimly lit cellar as she listens to Behzad recite Forugh's "The Wind Will Carry Us." to agree with. Zeynab defies the colonialist desire for discovery associated with the male gaze, and the scene is beautifully crafted in terms of both the poetry pervading the atmosphere and the cinematography that allows Zeynab's face to be within the frame, yet not revealed at any point. This subterranean episode, however, in addition to its enticing, yet unfulfilling scopophilic appeal, is worthy of analysis from a psychoanalytic perspective, for the underground of an edifice is analogous to the hidden recesses of the unconscious.13 Thus, Behzad's down ward movement to the cellar mirrors a spatial movement to the tabooed terrains of his unconscious mind with all its hidden and outlawed mundane desires. The cellar clearly serves as an otherworldly space, for where do people milk their cows in the dim light of a basement? Its dimness allows Behzad to feel less inhib ited in the expression of his inner desires; in Freudian terms, the id finds a suitable breeding ground in the cellar. Being of a (pseudo-) intellectual nature, Behzad expresses his manly desires in the form of a poetic piece that is meant to bid the teenaged Zeynab to ponder the ephemeral joys of life. In addition, it would per haps not be too far-fetched to assert that the teats of the subterranean cow might serve as a subtle hint at the sexual undertone that runs through the cellar scene, especially, in view of the complexities associated with the portrayal of sexuality on screen in an Islamic country like Iran. Zeynab herself traverses across spaces as she is seen early in the film leav ing her grave-digging beau's side along the elevated terrain of the village. Behzad is able to spot her, along with a dozen other inhabitants of the village, as he him self is exploring the ups and downs of the new territory. The spatial shifting of the mostly anonymous female characters has come to the attention of Behzad as he keenly takes mental note of the contradistinction of female mobility and male passivity across this new terrain. As Geoffrey Cheshire has noted, movement in general is of great significance in the way Siyah Darreh's inhabitants are charac terized.14 One of the visual highlights of the film is seeing the village and the 84 POUNEH SAEEDI</page><page sequence="5">mobility of its inhabitants and visitors through the eyes of our focalizer, Engineer Behzad. One scene in particular which highlights Behzad's function as a focaliz er occurs early on in the movie when he is shaving his face in the movie while staring supposedly at the mirror, but technically, at us. The specular association that is created between the spectators and the lead character as a result is one that evokes Charles Baudelaire's "You! Hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable— mon frère!" Thus, feeling one with Behzad whose reflection in the mirror coin cides with the look of his entire audience, one begins to take in the rural land scape of Siyah Darreh through his eyes. Ultimately, it is not only Abbas Kiarostami whose role as a detective/director is being questioned throughout the film, but the role that we as spectators play in engaging in such consumerist behavior which leads to the perpetuation of invasive actions as those attempted on the part of the likes of Behzad/Kiarostami in the name of art. Given the overall immobility of his accompanying colleagues who, despite remaining invisible throughout the movie, are indirectly shown to be either con fined to the space of their rented room or busy with strawberry-picking, we are not surprised that they decide to leave Siyah Darreh before the ailing matriarch of the village dies or even before they are able to garner any groundbreaking experience from their journey. A Bergman aficionado is bound to be reminded of the contrast between the profound evocation of strawberries in Wild Strawberries (1957) that enabled Dr. Borg to finally come to terms with his feminine side and consequently die in peace, and its status as a practically futile activity in The Wind Will Carry Us. In their failure to move beyond the quarters of their rented lodgings and venture out, other than to gather strawberries, Behzad's crew fails to experience any of the female figurations that lead to the latter's inner trans formation. Behzad's colleagues fail to break out of their patriarchal shell and embrace the new plane of existence and geography of life that Siyah Darreh has to offer with all its mazes and labyrinths. Despite all his characteristic short comings, right from the beginning of the film, Behzad sets himself apart from the rest of his team by savouring a particular poetic moment. He effectively replaces cartography with a geography of nature, which the new mode of orientation in the village requires, as is seen early in the film when he quotes a line from Suhrab Sepehri's poem, "Where is the Friend's Home?" as they seek to locate a solitary tree that they have been told by the locals is an indicator of their prox imity to their destination: "Within the tree's reach, there is a pathway greener than the dreams of God." Suhrab Sepehri's verse serves as an intertextual allusion to the director's highly acclaimed movie, Where is the Friend's Home?, which takes its name from Sepehri's poem of the same title, in which an eight-year-old character embarks on the almost impossible mission of finding his friend's house through the labyrinthine pathways of the northern Iranian village of Koker. It also sets a poet ic tone from the beginning of the film that goes on to include the great fourteenth century poet, Hafez, and culminates in Forugh's "The Wind Will Carry Us." The overall poesis of the film lends it a feminine touch in the dominance of the "pre aesthetic," a series of seemingly quotidian activities performed by women that FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US 85</page><page sequence="6">"displaces aesthetic hierarchies and generic categories, and which thus estab lishes a semiotic ground for a different production of reference and meaning."15 The daily activities of the female inhabitants of Siyah Darreh are in harmony with the cycles of life. This is manifest, for example, in a woman giving birth to her tenth child only to shortly get up and go about her daily business. The quotidian activities of homemakers engaged in the upkeep of family lives can be regarded as a form of aesthetics that defies the dryness of the Law or the Lacanian "Name of the Father." The aesthetics and politics of housework were debated by femi nist film critics in the late 1970s and the 1980s. The argument concerned the dynamics of "feminine aesthetics" within the context of American poet Sylvia Plath's novel The Bell Jar (1963); more specifically, whether or not the rug crafted by Mrs. Willard in the novel constitutes a disrespect for the artistic efforts of a woman. Instead of being appreciated for its artistic merits by being hung on the wall or incorporated into the repository of a museum, it is placed on the floor and put to everyday use; as a result of which, it ends up suffering the wear and tear that will eventually turn it into a derelict item bound for the dustbin (of his tory).16 Silvia Bovenschen, triggered a series of discussions on feminine aesthet ics in the 1970s with her article "Is there a Feminine Aesthetic?": On the one hand we see aesthetic activity deformed, atrophied, but on the other, we find, even within this restricted scope, socially creative impulses... remained bound to everyday life, feeble attempts to make this sphere aesthet ically pleasing. But the price for this was narrow-mindedness. The object could never leave the realm in which it came into being, it remained tied to the household, and it could never break loose and initiate communication.17 Bovenschen's argument runs counter to that of film director Chantai Ackerman who in an interview about her movie Jeanne Dielman (1975) expresses satisfaction in how her "feminist film had given space to...the daily gestures of woman."18 Similarly, Alice Walker expresses effusive admiration for her mother's gift in turning "whatever rocky soil she landed on, into a garden."19 In the same spirit of the "pre-aesthetics" presented in Ackerman and Walker's arguments, Kiarostami's The Wind Will Carry Us gives ample space to "the daily gestures of woman" with the difference that they are not confined to the private space of their homes but are performed outside in the full view of everyone, to the advantage of the Tehrani, Behzad. The dictates of the Islamic system demand that women be veiled across all spaces, both public and private (confounding viewers from outside Iran as to whether Iranian women are, actu ally, obligated to observe the Islamic dress code in the privacy of their homes at all times). As Behzad becomes absorbed in the landscape of this Kurdish village, the everyday activities of the rural women fascinate him even more, especially, since it becomes clear to him how heavily the male population depends on them in terms of their daily sustenance. Behzad observes that the name of the village Siyah Darreh does not accord with the overall dominance of white in the village ("siyah" means black in Persian), and his preconception of the rural women as 86 POUNEH SAEEOI</page><page sequence="7">Behzad attempts to capture a shot of the coffee house owner, Taj Dawlat, but she refuses. FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US 87</page><page sequence="8">being meek and subservient is shattered once he is faced with an older female café owner, Taj Dawlat. She forbids him to take her picture as she is serving cus tomers in her coffee house, and Zeynab does not allow him to catch a close glimpse of her face despite falling into his frame of vision. Notwithstanding their immense age difference, both these women embody similar pre-aesthetics, which exude independence and contribute to the overall sustenance of the village and its visitors. The resistance manifested by both Zeynab and Taj Dawlat to being captured within the visual frame of, respectively, the male scopophilia and the camera, is emblematic of their strength of character and unwillingness to become objecti fied by the male gaze. An example of how the camera can reduce a female sub ject to the colonialist's object has been elaborated in great detail by Kaja Silverman, through the example of photographs taken by French imperialists of Algerian women (some of whom had hitherto not revealed their hair save to close relatives within the quarters of their homes) in 1960 in the process of issu ing identity cards for them. As noted by Silverman, part of the horror associated with being photographed is linked to how "the photograph severs a moment from the temporal continuum and 'carries' it away to another domain."20 Behzad's attempts at capturing the faces of the rural women within a filmic frame resonates with Cixous's reference to the domineering male's attempts at invoking a terrifying territory of womankind by associating women with dark ness and the colonized continent of Africa. It stands in contrast with Kiarostami's technique of giving free reign to the camera to capture the immediacy of the over all routine pervading the village—so much so that film critic David Oubina has referred to how Kiarostami "ceaselessly breaks the boundaries (which separate) documentary and fiction."21 Instead of reducing the spatio-temporal continuum of the women's daily existence to one static moment in time and space, Kiarostami wishes to convey the daily movement, the rhythm of life and nature that reigns over that rural region. Unlike his lead character who wishes to satisfy the male gaze by confin ing these women's faces within his visual frame (after all, the veil acts as a screen that bars scopic access to the body), Kiarostami seems to be interested in how the female figures function within the overall landscape. In the end, Behzad realizes that the women whose aura he has been interested in "carrying away" are resistant to both the male gaze and its extension, the camera. It is only then that he bids Zeynab to let the wind carry them away and this brings us to the significance of the film's title, borrowed from the poem by Forugh: Ah, in my small night, the wind has a tryst with the leaves of trees in my small night, there is fear for destruction listen! do you hear darkness blowing? I look upon this bliss in a strange way I am addicted to my own despair. 88 POUNEH SAEED!</page><page sequence="9">Listen! Can you hear the darkness blowing? In the night now, there is something passing the moon is red and restless and upon this roof which harbours fear for a fall at any moment the clouds like a crowd of mourners seem to be awaiting the moment of rain a moment and thereupon naught. Behind this window, the night is atremble and the earth is about to stand still behind this window, an unknown frets over you and me. You, who are green from head to toe, put your hands like a burning memory into my loving hands and entrust your lips like a warm sense of being to the caresses of my loving lips. The wind will carry us away the wind will carry us away. Much has been written on Forugh and her influence on both Iranian cinema and modern poetry; yet, as Hamid Dabashi elegantly explicates, an accurate appreciation of her artistic oeuvre is bound to include her directing one of the best documentaries Iran has ever produced: The House is Black (Khaneh siyaah ast, 1963). In fact, for a better appreciation of the poem "The Wind Will Carry Us," which is part of Forugh's collection of poems known as Another Birth, it is impor tant to take a look at The House is Black, especially when discussing it within a cinematic context. Though the film's producer, Ebrahim Golestan, describes the film's objective as the alleviation of an ugliness ("leprosy"), the documentary is replete with poetic images that have no bearing on finding a cure to "this ugli ness," creating a complex work described by Jonathan Rosenbaum as "one of the very few successful fusions of literary poetry with film poetry."22 Forugh's poetic narration, recited by herself in the film, interweaves Biblical verses with reflec tions of her own on the plight of the inhabitants of a leper colony in Azerbaijan, which serves as a microcosm for the world at large, and the spectator feels drawn into a netherworld of human grotesqueness that questions divine dispensation.23 Forugh gives voice to the thoughts of the collective body of the leper colony in the following lines: "My bones were not hidden from you when I was being created away from the public eye and being sculpted within the bowels of the earth." We, too, are confounded as to what cosmic force would wish to allow for such malformations to take place. The existential questions that begin to puzzle Behzad in The Wind Will Carry Us may be of a different mode; yet, they are similar in functioning as a "metaphor" in the sense of taking him beyond the confines of the (masculine) Self into the realm of the (feminine) Other. However, in addition to the similitude between the ontological odyssey of the narrator (and FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US 89</page><page sequence="10">consequently the spectator) in The House is Black and the interior journey that Behzad experiences in The Wind Will Carry Us, we find the imagery of dark and lightness, the juxtaposition of life and death, as well as the emphasis on the elemental sources of nature, particularly wind and earth, that align these two artistic creations. The significance of light and darkness as cosmic forces is etched on the psy che of Iranians whose ancient book of creation known as Bundahishn presents anthropomorphic images of the two, which disparate as they may be, form the oneness of life. Ohrmazd, the embodiment of good, and Angra Mainyu, the man ifestation of forces of evil, battle it out and become intermingled and monstrous doubles; in other words, without one entity, there is little meaning to the other.24 Forugh's stress on darkness can be viewed within a Persianate perspective that comes close to the ideology embedded in the Ouroborus, that of a dragon eating its own tail to represent the cycle of perfection and primordial unity in its equal incorporation of black and white, as well as male and female principles. She ini tiates the poems in her collection Another Birth with cameos of darkness in the hopes of finding the light at the end of the poetic tunnel and ultimately life itself. While The House is Black is permeated with dark and light images, The Wind Will Carry Us is primarily dominated by colourful shots. In addition to forming an intertextual reading with Forugh's cinematic oeuvre as I shall shortly explain, The Wind Will Carry Us invokes Cixous's allusion to women being equated with the "black" territory of Africa. Cixous's sarcastic reference to the masculinist portrayal of women as objective correlatives of Africa in the following terms, res onates with the female figurations of the movie: "Dark is dangerous. You can't see anything in the dark, you're afraid. Don't move, you might fall. Most of all, don't go into the forest. And so we have internalized the horror of the dark."25 The imagery of darkness embedded in these words is not only aligned with colonialism—a discourse figured in the rural women's defiance in the face of the colonialist apparatus of the male camera—but also gives an added layer of meaning to the darkness that pervades the cellar scene, which conjures up the dichotomy of whiteness and blackness on multiple levels. Firstly, one is reminded of Behzad's comment on Siyah Darreh being a misnomer for a village whose architectural structure is so overwhelmingly white; secondly, the cellar scene begins in pitch-black darkness. This sets the tone for Behzad's poetic citation from "Gift" ("Hediyeh"), another poem from the collection Another Birth. Indeed, Behzad begins to recite a part of Forugh's short poem "Gift" in which darkness gives way to light: "Should you come to my home, bring a lamp for me, 0 friend, and also a window through which I can look at the crowd on the happy alley." He makes no mention of the first lines of the poem which read: "I speak of the extremity of the night, I speak of the infinitesimal darkness and the endlessness of the night," perhaps because the relatively long shot of darkness in the scene makes those words redundant. Gradually, the subterranean darkness is dispelled as Zeynab's hurricane lamp gives off just enough light for her to perform the task of milking the cow while Behzad continues to recite the next segment of Another Birth, which is "The Wind Will Carry Us." 90 POUNEH SAEEDI</page><page sequence="11">A comparison of The Wind Will Carry Us with The House is Black brings to our attention not only the dominance of "darkness" as a state of existence in both films, but also their similar recourse to the elemental sources of nature. However, while the elements of nature fail to evoke any glimmer of hope for the denizens of "the black house," as can be detected in the invocation of the Biblical verse "Remember that my life is but wind, and my eyes shall not return to see good things" (Job 7:7), a potential for an escape to another plane of existence by virtue of wind is suggested by Forough in her poem "The Wind Will Carry Us." This constitutes a climactic moment in the film of the same name where Behzad has to, in a sense, experience the "dark night of the soul."26 This religious (pre dominantly masculine) logos may guide us towards an abstract form of libera tion; however, Forugh, in being both a woman and a poet, is more predisposed towards a sensual, if not sexual, form of ex-stasis, a "standing out of oneself."27 The breaking out of spatio-temporal constraints, which constitutes a prelude to ex-stasis, cannot take place through mere physical means; rather, one has to reach an elevated existence that comes only with a transcendental experience with the elemental forces of Mother Nature. In The House is Black, the abun dance of both verbal and visual references to "feet" (one of the students at the leper colony thanks the Almighty for them because they "allow me to go wher ever I please") brings home the fact that the denizens of the infernal colony find no solace in their feet. Their appendages are undergoing degeneration and even if they were still whole, they would be incapable of taking them beyond their lep rosy-ridden confines. Significantly, Forugh even goes on to list a number of birds in the film, including doves, owls, pelicans and sparrows, all of which, despite being winged, are bound to the earth and thus doomed to their own miserable destiny. Moreover, corporeal consubstantiality, which comes to the fore as bones are aligned with the bowels of the earth, further confirms our oneness, our inex tricability from the binding earth.28 The one possible refuge offered in "The Wind Will Carry Us" is showcased in a union with elemental forces and a communion with another fellow-human being which has the potential of carrying us to a moment beyond time and space. The metaphoric ecstasy embedded in "The Wind Will Carry Us" is framed by "Another Birth," another poem by Forugh, and it may be better appreciated in light of this poem from which her groundbreaking collection of poems takes its title. Similar to "Gift" and "The Wind Will Carry Us," the first image of "Another Birth" is one of a darkness that soon gives way to an image of life and light. In its fragmentary allusions to variegated images of life and death, "Another Birth" is very clearly aligned with the characteristics attributed to écriture feminine insofar as it is interspersed with fragmentary imagery and the sensory and aural beauty, and at times, magical qualities of the words—for example, the repetition of the onomatopoeic "aah." These poetic fragments constitute autobiographical threads that run through Forugh's poetry in the form of direct references to her life, such as a shortened form of her son's name (Kami), or in the instances of lived experience. The poetic characteristics of "The Wind Will Carry Us," includ ing its episodic structure, are reflected in the film through long-shots, especially FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US 91</page><page sequence="12">those featuring Behzad embarking on the village's meandering paths as he is lured into the realm of poetry. These shots become a metaphor for life itself as they bid us to put aside our logo-centric, goal-oriented life and learn to savour the beauties put forth on our way. As the forces of nature such as the wind and the tree are anthropomor phized, we, along with the youthful Zeynab, who is milking the cow in the het erotopic space of a darkened cellar, are called upon to allow ourselves to be carried away by the wind and escape from the constraints of this world onto another plane of existence whose intensity should endow our lives with mean ing. As film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum has pointed out with regard to the cellar scene, it is likely that the reason the Iranian government initially had issues with this film has to do with the "erotic atmosphere in the cellar [which it found] unacceptably provocative. "29 The female figurations that permeate the film, if not erotic, evoke oneness with nature and an inner harmony that is not quite present in the male charac ters. We see the women mostly confined to the background yet actively present not only in the disembodied figure of Behzad's employer, Mrs. Gudarzi, but also in female figures hidden beneath stacks of hay as they plough the land and milk the cows.30 As mentioned at the beginning, more than in concrete, corporeal terms, the feminine manifests itself in what Cixous has referred to as écriture fem inine, which by definition evades "the discourse that regulates the phallocentric system," places experience before language, and privileges non-linear, cyclical writing over the linear masculine logos.31 Some feminist critics, along with Elaine Showalter, have read écriture femi nine as "the inscription of the female body and female difference in language and text,"32 but a text need not be crafted by a woman to qualify as feminine. In fact, as De Lauretis maintains, "men too have written 'as woman'—Nietzsche, Artaud, Lautrémont, even Joyce apparently did—and others nowadays, all honorable men, are 'reading as a woman.'"33 As far as filmic narratives are concerned, one could definitely add Kiarostami to the list of those auteurs engaged in "female writing," even in movies like Where is the Friend's Home?, where there is hardly any female presence. What I mean by 'female writing' is a text that does not fol low the patriarchal linear structure, one that is not, necessarily, invested in hav ing a beginning, middle, and an end. The description Tonia Modleski offers with respect to the feminine characteristic of soap operas holds true for a filmic nar rative like The Wind Will Carry Us, though on a grander scale: "The narrative, by placing ever more complex obstacles between desire and its fulfillment, makes anticipation of an end an end in itself."34 In addition to the seemingly endless anticipation that aligns the movie with qualities embedded in the feminine filmic genre of soap operas, is the almost compulsive repetition of Behzad's movements to and from the hill adjacent to the rural cemetery. These movements endow the films with a circularity characterizing écriture feminine. The circularity of the filmic structure is further crystallized in the winding path, which the protagonist of Kiarostami's acclaimed movie takes with his crew to reach the village of Siyah Darreh in Kurdestan. This path concretizes a call for 92 POUNEH SAEEDI</page><page sequence="13">Behzad and the local doctor meander through nature as they ponder the cycle of life and death. delayed gratification on the part of both the protagonist and the spectator, whose hope for closure will not be materialized unless he or she learns to transpose that hope to an open-ended process rather than a well-defined finality. There are other poetic images that support such a reading of The Wind Will Carry Us including the flowing river and the crawling turtle.35 What, initially, seems to be a process without progression to Behzad and his crew of filmmakers, begins to take on meaning for the Engineer, who, eventually, comes to appreciate the exquisite aspects of life that had appeared to him as mundane and quotidian ear lier in the film. Once Behzad consigns the (human) bone he had picked up at the beginning of his trip to Siyah Darreh to the river, the spectator gets the sense that the protagonist has finally become resigned to the cyclical essence of life and death. Behzad's resignation comes only upon letting go of his desire for captur ing on camera the death of the old matriarch of the village and an understand ing for another, so to speak, feminine aspect of life: one that calls for a savouring of the synesthesia seeping through existence. Given women's oneness with life and nature, it is not surprising to see that the old woman who inspired this narrative, Maliheh Malik, refuses to let go of her grip on life. In the process, she teaches Behzad an important lesson for any opinionated man, namely, that it is essential to appreciate the feminine side of life, which becomes manifest in what Dabashi calls "the vision of life on earth, certainty in the real, a celebration of the transitory, the festive embracing of being-toward-now."36 It is perhaps not coincidental that Behzad finally learns to appreciate the circularity of a feminine narrative that is in harmony with the cycle of life only when the matriarch of the village is about to die. After all, it is he who bids the village doctor to visit the old woman after the doctor's physical examination of the grave-digger upon the latter's close brush with death. In a bid to save the old woman from a death that he had been yearning for all this while, he must accompany the doctor on his motor-bike meanderings through the greenery that envelopes the Kurdish village. The circularity of their path becomes FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US 93</page><page sequence="14">a crystallization not only of feminine writing, which is echoed in the doctor's recitation of poetry, but also of the full circle that Behzad has finally reached on his voyage to this village. It evokes his own soul-searching journey as well as the flow of the river and the cycle of life itself. NOTES 1. Negar Mottahedeh, Displaced Allegories: Post-revolutionary Iranian Cinema (Durham: Duke University, 2008), 91. 2. The term "figuration," as remarked by Roland Barthes, is to be distinguished from "representation," in that, while the former can be aligned with the erotic desires of the body, the latter keeps such desires in check by confining them to the configura tion of those upon whom it acts. It seems that while "figuration" falls within the domain of jouissance which surpasses language, "representation," in lending itself to utterance, becomes contiguous with plaisir. See: The Pleasure of the Text, trans. Richard Miller (New York: Hill Wang, 1975), 56-57. 3. It is worth noting that Behzad's anticipation for the death of the village matriarch can be read on multiple levels. For example, Hamid Naficy takes this anticipation as the focal point of the movie and sees the entire film as "a treatise about waiting (entezaar), a concept important in Iranian and Twelver Shiite philosophy, which allows the faithful to patiently await the better day that Mahdi, the twelfth Imam, will bring with him on his reappearance." See: A Social History of Iranian Cinema, Volume 4: The Globalizing Era, 1984 2010 (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2010), 225. 4. Within the context of the paper, it is important to note that in Iran, mohandes (engineer) beyond indicating a person's career, is a deferential title, which I believe falls into the sphere of what French theorist Jacques Lacan refers to as the symbolic order. The symbolic is the third stage in the formation of selfhood and is invested in the priority of "symbols," "not icons, stylized figurations, but signifiers, in the sense developed by Saussure and Jakobson, extended into a generalized definition: differential elements, in themselves without meaning, which acquire value only in their mutual relations, and forming a closed order." See Jacques Lacan, Écrits: A Selection, trans. Alan Sheridan (New York and London: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1977), ix. 5. One such example is seen in a work as famous as Sadeq Hedayat's novella, The Blind Owl (Buf-i Kur), in which a woman represented in both "ethereal" and "diabolical" forms is murdered by a male narrator whose voice smothers any opportunity for female expression. Another instance appears in the not so well known short story by Ahmad Mahmood, In the Dark (Dar Tariki) in which a man neglects the medical complications plaguing his wife's fourth pregnancy to the point of bringing about her death. It is, therefore,.of little surprise, on an allegorical level at least, that a man should be so intent on a woman's death; in particular, if the woman in question is well passed her prime. 6.

Joan Copjec has argued that the hejab has had a significant influence on the look of Iranian cinema: "The challenge facing all Iranian filmmakers, then, is to make credible and compelling films under these conditions, namely: the censorship of inferiority, of intimacy." "The Object-Gaze: Shame, Hejab, Cinema," Filzofski vestnik 27.2 (2006): 12. Hamid Naficy has also highlighted how the veil has led Iranian filmmakers to come up with novel strategies to intimate a close bond between a man and a woman.

The Iranian novel, Touba and the Meaning of the Night (Tuba va ma'na-yi shab) by Iranian feminist writer, Shahrnush Parsipur provides ample examples of how the cellar can be associated with the realm of the subconscious. 14. As Godfrey Cheshire posits, there is a shift from horizontal to vertical spatial orien tation in Siyah Darreh, the significance of which can be traced back to "Oriental Philosophy" and the quest for a higher terrain of understanding embodied in the image of the cosmic mountain of Qaf. Great works of literature with an eschatological bearing including twelfth century Persian mystic, Shihabeddin Suhravardi's Philosophical Allegories and Mystical Treatises and the great Italian poet of the thir teenth century Dante Alighieri's Commedia, demonstrate how in order to be able to experience the heights of an elevated existence, one needs to explore the depths of darkness. It is true that The Wind Will Carry Us is not meant to be read as an eschatological text; yet, it is embedded in the spatial movements of the lead character who, unlike the rest of the crew, is invested in exploring the new terrain. 15.

The concept of the "dark night of the soul" has been attributed to the sixteenth century Spanish St. John of the Cross, and most likely, it was not even remotely on Kiarostami's mind when he was crafting the cellar scene. However, I have made a slight allusion to it in a bid to highlight the contradistinction it poses to Forugh's call to make optimum use of the forces of Mother Nature in order to seek a form of (sensual) salvation. In contrast to Forugh's proactive and sensual call for the use of FEMALE FIGURATIONS IN KIAROSTAMI'S THE WIND WILL CARRY US 95</page><page sequence="16">darkness, amongst other natural phenomena, the Spanish saint advocates an abstract process of purgation of sins marked by passivity for the exaltation of the soul. 27. According to Robert Wicks, most women in having a maternal instinct are more capable of ex-stasis in the literal sense of displacement outside of oneself, if not in the figurative sense suggested by Arthur Schopenhauer of "union with God."

As noted by Azadeh Farahmand, the film offers "a dichotomous characterization of city and village women. The absent wife and the female producer of the 'engineer' in charge of the funeral shooting expedition both make impatient phone calls that are unnecessary and comically troubling. The nuisance of these absent urban women is thus set against the exoticism of village women, rendered through their mysterious silence, outspoken wisdom and magically maternal and resilient strug gles in life."

Alberto Elena is right in seeing the crawling turtle and the flowing river as part of the wider perspective adopted by Behzad towards the end which focuses on the theme of "life goes on" notwithstanding all the obstacles: "The bone in the river, the water flowing, the goats grazing: undoubtedly 'life goes on,' exactly the same as when the tortoise manages to get back on its feet and climbs up the tombstone, or the beetle rolls a ball over and over."
