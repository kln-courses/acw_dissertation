<plain_text><page sequence="1">Seno/ane: Testimonianze e /rammenti. Ed- ited with Introduction, Translation and Commentary by MARIO UNTERSTEINER. ("Biblioteca di Studi Superiori," Vol. XXXIII.) Florence: "La Nuova Italia," 1956. Pp. cclxxx+156. L. 4000. This edition of Xenophanes is the first of a series which Professor Untersteiner plans to devote to the Eleatic philoso- phers. It contains a substantial intro- duction in addition to the text of the testimonia and fragments with a trans- lation and notes. The major part of the introduction is concerned with the author- ship of the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise "De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia." In his recent book on the sophists, Untersteiner gave some brief attention to this question and inclined to agree with Diels in as- sigining the treatise to an eclectic writer of the first century A.D. In the present work, however, he reverts to Diels's earlier dating of MXG as not later than the third century B.C., and declares himself in favor of a Megarian authorship. He does not think the author to have been a particu- larly distinguished member of the school, and no one name is definitely fixed upon. Two are suggested, however: Metrodorus 4 Oeop-tavrtxOk and Timagoras of Gela. (The selection of either would have the advantage of accounting for the doxo- graphical aspects of MXG, since both men were students of Theophrastus as well as members of the Megarian school.) Although, as Untersteiner says, there is nothing against this thesis, I am not con- vinced that there is very much in favor of it. The supposedly Megarian elements in MXG, such as the reductio ad absurdum, the attack on conclusions rather than premises, and the rejection of argument from analogy, are surely not so exclusively the property of any one school as to need explanation in this way. In one case at least, I believe that U.'s eagerness to bring out the Megarian character of the Xeno- phanian section has led him very much astray. Following, I think unwisely, a lead from M. Dal Pra, he maintains that a number of arguments near the end of this section are based on a dialectical method derived by the Anonymous Megarian Author from the paradox of the Liar. U. argues that when, for instance, at 978a 25-26, the Anon. suggests the possibility of making the same predication (that of infinity) of both the existent and the non- existent, he is attempting to discredit dis- cursive thought by means of "un'efficace</page><page sequence="2">258 BOOK REVIEWS applicazione del +eA61ievog." This ap- plication is obvious, U. says, since "... l'infinita include tanto l'ente, quanto il non-ente, che lo nega; cosi l'ente e un tutto che e parte di se stesso, in quanto ha accanto a se nell'unita dell' bretcpi il non- ente; e 1' ab6tpEoc, che e una parte, si risolve nel tutto."'I I would make the following comments: (1) U. has given no evidence that the Megarians ever employed the Liar as the basis of any species of dialectical method. (2) Supposing that they did so, the ex- ample cited would show a failure on their part to understand the essential character of the Liar. That is, the Anon. Megarian is represented as attempting: (a) to rep- resent the opposition between truth and falsity in the Liar by a confused three cornered relationship between infinity, the existent and the nonexistent; (b) to make an analysis into whole and part which is not an adequate expression of the re- lationship between truth and falsity in the Liar and which results in a very misleading use of "includes"; (c) to apply the Liar to a group of concepts lacking the re- flexivity which is its essence. In view of the fact that the Megarians were noted for their construction of paradoxes, this all seems very strange. (3) U. has stated that the Liar was employed by the Megarians in order to discredit discursive thought (86Cvoto). However, from my own reading of MXG, I do not find that this is the conclusion drawn from the passages which U. cites as examples of the Liar in action. When the author suggests that infinity might be predicated of both the existent and the nonexistent, he is giving an illus- tration of the general view put forward in this section that certain absurdities may be avoided by allowing the same predication to be made of opposites. (An- other illustration occurs at 97&amp;b 4-7, where existence is predicated of both the one and the many, and, as a result, it becomes 1. "Infinity includes both the existent and the nonex- istent which negates it; thus the existent is a whole which is part of itself, inasmuch as it has with it, in the unity of the creptca, the nonexistent; and the drnetpta, which is a part, resolves itself into the whole." unreasonable to assert that God, who is one, does not exist simply because the many do exist.) I cannot see any of this as a rejection of L&amp;0vo&amp;o; it seems to me to be rather a discussion of predication which is an assistance to discursive thought, not a rejection of it. (It is, incidentally, a discussion which profits from work on negation already done by Plato and thor- oughly understood by Aristotle.) A number of views maintained by U. in the remainder of the introduction I have space simply to mention briefly: (1) X. is not the founder of Eleaticism but he is indirectly responsible for the begin- nings of logic and of negative theology. (2) X. is a critic, not of polytheism, but of anthropomorphism. His own views are based on a revival of the ancient religion of Gaia. (3) X.'s god was not spherical but simply oLoto4. He resembles a 7reptkXov more than a sphere. (4) X.'s god is an expression of mana which is on its way to becoming voi34. Since his being and acting are two indistin- guishable moments, it is wrong to differen- tiate him from the world and a kind of pan- rationalism results. (5) X. was not a rhapsode in the strict sense of the word, although he may well have given recitations in the company of his equals. Any public perform- ances were probably limited to the two historical poems on Colophon and Elea. (6) There is no decisive break in the evolution of X.'s thought, only a gradual shift from physics to theology. (However it is not wise to make a distinction between these two in X.) (7) X. has brought into philosophy a new tendency, "la ricerca di cio che e es- senziale." His philosophy consists of a gradual unification of a plural universe. U.'s text is fairly conservative. A sug- gested rearrangement of Frags. 23-26 ap- pears in chapter iv, and a cautious attitude is recommended toward DK's designation of some fragments as ZDXot or as belonging to a rept p'aeq. On page C, line 4, "279" should read 979, and on the same page, line 11, "970" should be 979. ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE Bryn Mawr, Penn8ylvania</page></plain_text>
