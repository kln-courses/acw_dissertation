<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES AT HOME WITH NATURE: EARLY REFLECTIONS ON GREEN BUILDING LAWS AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT By Keith H. Hirokawa* Green building, which was formalized only fifteen years ago to promote healthier and more efficient building practices ; has exceeded virtually all predictions of its potential. Green building has entered markets in almost every major city in the United States , while developing as a sophisticated basis for investment ; human health, and conservation. Stated otherwise, green building is no longer a fringe environmental policy and, as argued in this Article, is even shedding its markings as a political ideology. This Article examines two parallel but distinct consequences of the green building movement. First, by considering the major challenges to green building, this Article examines the conditions for success of the movement- how green building has become acceptable to consumers, the construction industry ; and building regulators. Second, this Article explores the relationship between the goals and methods of green building laws and argues that green building compels a transformative, constructivist effect on humans' place and position in nature. This Article ultimately argues that green building is special because of its pluralistic approach to regulation, ethics, and even to nature itself. * Assistant Professor, Albany Law School.

Introduction Buildings are one of the distinguishing elements of human civilization, but if they are not constructed thoughtfully they can waste precious natural and financial resources, as well as harm the environment and the health of people who use them.1 Although it is generally accepted that the built environment (homes, office buildings, schools, roads, dams, etc.) imposes adverse but avoidable impacts on the natural environment, we have had some trouble identifying what changes to make in our building practices.2 One application of sustainability principles to building design, construction, and operation - known as green building - has provided some guidance on how to change the way we build. Green building represents the notion that by consciously 1 S.F., Cal., Env't Code ch. 7, ยง 700, http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp? pid=14134&amp;sid=5 Gast visited July 19, ,2009). 2 See in/ha Part ID.

The quote is not intended to suggest that the goals, concepts, and techniques involved in green building suddenly materialized only fifteen years ago. Rather, many of the ideas implemented in green building codes - such as certain materials, passive designs, and solar equipment and design - have been used for decades, and in some cases, centuries. See, e.g., Bldg. Design &amp; Construction, White Paper on Sustainability 4 (2003), available at http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Resources/BDCWhitePaper R2.pdf. The quote specifically refers to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) programs developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). See generally Fedruzzi, supra However, underlying this Article is the notion that the recent activities of the USGBC and similar groups have turned the ideas of green building into a viable and successful movement. As such, I would suggest that the quoted statement does refer to something more extensive than the LEED programs. 5 Fedruzzi, supra note 4. 6 Bldg.

Of course, one easy answer - the most common answer - is that the threat of climate change has found the mainstream ear, and green building provides some response to our current understanding of the linkage between past consumptive practices and the increasing threat of climate change.9 The easy answer, however, may not account for the breadth of green building's popularity; given the birth of green building from the principles of sustainability, and that sustainability was largely championed as an environmental cause, we might have expected a property backlash against green building to match that seen in previous environmental regulations.10 If curtailing consumptive practices was the only perceived benefit of green building, the trend might be understood simply as the next incremental step in the otherwise embattled evolution of the environmental movement into state and local regulation. The development of green building laws illustrates that there is something special involved. The thought behind efficient, "greener" building is that a more informed approach to the built environment can result in buildings that complement the natural environment, instead of conflict with it.11 Yet, in green building there is no attempt to prevent human interaction with the environment.12 Green building assumes that construction will occur, that building materials are needed, and that land and natural resources will be transformed, used, or otherwise displaced - but meanwhile is reflective of the fact that every building causes avoidable environmental impacts.13 Meanwhile, the pluralistic and informational approach of green building has accommodated a convergence of economics and environmental protection, of resource use and nonuse, and of anthropocentrism and the needs of nature's Others.14 The success of this convergence suggests that the environmental 9 Bradford Swing categorically attributes the "key underlying issue motivating green building work [to be] . . . the threat of climate change." Swing, supra note 3, at 50. Likewise, Edna Sussman identifies the primary goal of green building to be a mitigating measure against carbon emissions and climate change. Edna Sussman, Reshaping Municipal and County Laws to Foster Green Building, Energy Efficiency, and Renewable Energy, 16 N.Y.U. Envtl. L.J. 1, 2 (2008). In contrast, Del Perciรฒ attributes the green building movement in general to the "sick building syndrome" of the 1960s and 70s. See Stephen T. Del Perciรฒ, The Skyscraper, Green Design, &amp; the LEED Green Building Rating System: The Creation of Uniform Sustainable Standards for the 21st Century or the Perpetuation of an Architectural Fiction ?t 28 Environs: Envtl.

BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 17. Green's point, of course, was that features contributing to market value (based on how the market perceives value) are more influential - and will "win" - than features which might be understood as mere preference. Yet, as discussed herein, green building challenges our prior perceptions of value in the marketplace. 1 1 See City of Boston, supra note 3. 12 See generally id.

This Article -examines green building laws to illuminate two important contributions from this movement: first, the manner in which these laws introduced green building into the regulatory process governing building construction has allowed the innovative ideas of sustainability to develop in ways that are ethically progressive and market friendly, and as such, appear fundamentally distinct from other environmental laws; and second, that the principles of green building suggest an effective approach to environmental protection that is ethically pluralistic. In Part II, this Article describes and further defines green building to illustrate the goals at issue in the movement. Part III turns to the development of green building laws in the United States to understand how these new ideas were able to navigate practical and legal challenges, and also to identify the more significant early successes of the movement. Part IV considers how the early successes are influencing the direction of green building and green building laws; given the manner in which green building laws have developed, this Article suggests that challenges are unlikely and, in any event, unlikely to be successful. Finally, Part V returns to the principles of sustainability and green building to examine the manner in which the pluralistic foundations of green building operate to expand the ethical implications of the built environment beyond the traditional human-centered, limited duties to the natural environment. II. What is Green Building? Probably no urban activity has greater impact on human health and the environment than building construction and use. Enormous quantities of resources are used during building construction, renovation and operation, and the production of these resources has substantial environmental impacts. It is estimated that 40% of raw materials consumed globally are used for buildings. In addition, in the United States, commercial and residential buildings are responsible for approximately 65% of electricity consumption, 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, 12% of potable water use and 136 million tons of construction and demolition waste annually. Also, many indoor building materials release hazardous toxins, impairing indoor air quality and reducing occupant health and productivity. [Because much electricity is locally produced] and many buildings use oil or natural gas for their heating and hot water, energy consumption in building operation translates into greater local pollution, including emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon dioxide, and mercury. These pollutants contribute to respiratory disease, heart disease, smog, acid rain, and climate change. Moreover, as energy demand rises, so does our reliance on dirty, inefficient power plants, as well as the nation's dependence on foreign oil and natural gas.15 A historical understanding of the built environment might illustrate the difference between construction that sets buildings into and in harmony 15 See N.Y., N.Y., Local Law 86, ยง 1 (Sept. 15, 2005).</page><page sequence="6">512 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 39:507 with an existing environment and construction that transforms and comes to characterize the natural environment. Although we may individually aspire to the former, our civilized tendencies toward the latter may be due to the manner in which we use the environment: we cut live trees to build homes (rather than reuse building materials); we use cheap (and easy to manufacture) chemicals to treat and decorate our homes; we value larger homes on larger lots; and we generally leave the lights on, toilet and faucet running, and (to some) we shower too often.16 As a result, in the United States, buildings drain immense amounts of energy and water and generate astounding quantities of waste.17 In the meantime, we arguably have not thought deeply enough about our choice of construction methods and building materials - both for structural durability, but also for indoor health and air quality implications.18 Given the foregoing, our human, built environment might be summarized as a bit short on wisdom, a bit short of foresight, and a bit long on economic interests - economic returns have historically taken priority over the "preference" for preservation of the natural environment.19 At least, environmental quality has been understood by many as a second-rate priority, barely even qualifying as a human need.20 Humans are emerging from the traditional perspective with a new sense of place and relationship with nature. EPA recently announced that "America is shifting to a 'green culture' where all 300 million citizens are embracing the fact that environmental responsibility is everyone's responsibility."21 The past fifteen years have seen an explosion in green building - indicating a dramatic market increase in both the awareness of and participation in realizing the potential benefits of higher-performing buildings - and a corresponding explosion in the incorporation of green building standards into the laws governing building construction.22 Why does this matter? According to the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), there are presently over 120 million homes in the United States, with an estimated 16 See generally id.

There have been many approaches to green building, resulting in several definitions.24 Each seems accurate, except that some appear more comprehensive than others.25 For instance, the term "green building," has been used in a manner coterminous with the term, "sustainability."26 In this use of the term, the goals of improved environmental quality through land development account for the assimilation of human presence in an environment characterized by scarcity. This approach exemplifies a more holistic, comprehensive approach to environmentally conscious building practices; examples of such green building might include smart growth planning on a comprehensive and inclusive scale, cluster zoning, comprehensive environmental planning, water conservation and aquifer 23 U.S. Green Bldg.

Agency, supra note 17, at 1. 24 Kibert, supra note 22, at 492. 25 Charles Kibert details the difficulty in defining terms this early in the green building movement as follows: Perhaps the most complex terminology used is sustainable construction which encompasses the notion of green building, but, in the spirit of sustainable development, addresses the social and economic issues of habitat, as well as the community context of buildings. 'Green' buildings are a subset of sustainable construction, representing simply the structures. In effect truly sustainable 'green' commercial buildings that are designed to be sustainable in the sense of renewable energy systems, closed materials loops, and full integration into the landscape are scarce to non-existent. High performance green buildings represent the current state of best practices with respect to attempting to reach . the Holy Grail of sustainable building. In the present era, green buildings generally represent incremental change rather than radical rethinking of the built environment. However this is an important first step and the green building landscape is populated with ever more experiments representing the trial and error process of getting to sustainable buildings. Kibert, supra note 22, at 492. ยฟb This Article is specifically concerned with building codes, laws, and ordinances that govern a "whole systems" approach to building design, construction, and operation. Therefore, this Article does not address other sustainability approaches and sustainable development codes that may be designed with similar purposes in mind. Examples might include green procurement strategies, rainwater harvesting ordinances, efficient irrigation laws, and gray- water use regulations, among others.

This more specific meaning of the term "green building" is not philosophically distinct from the broader category, but focuses more on 1) reducing the impacts on the natural environment from the construction process itself, such as siting, the quantity of materials used, their sources, and the waste created in the construction process, and 2) the long-term performance of buildings on both the natural and built environment, including the effect of design and materials used on energy and natural resource consumption, and preservation of indoor air quality and waste reduction. Green building goals are implemented in "green building codes" and other development regulations that seek to modify the prescriptions in conventional building codes.28 The development of green building guidelines and rating systems have consistently used "whole system" assessments, taking into account building location, materials, design, construction methods, and building operating systems.29 Although green building codes are intended to foster innovation and flexibility, they are concurrently designed to standardize green building by identifying actions that are deserving of individual credits towards the efficiency, low-impact, or other aspects of the "greenness" of buildings. In the accumulation of green credits, builders and buildings can achieve various "shades of greenness" - the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system currently offers four levels of green, entitled Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum - by weighing the attributes and green elements that are incorporated into the building design, 27 See generally James A. Kushner, Smart Growth: Urban Growth Management and Land- Use Regulation Law in America, 32 URB. Law. 211, 212 (2000) (discussing the current state of the law in relation to smart growth initiatives); Patricia E. Salkin, The Smart Growth Agenda: A Snapshot of State Activity at the Turn of the Century, 21 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 271, 272 (2002) (reviewing state smart growth activities). 28 Some of the specific practices employed in green building practices are occasionally shared in conventional homes and in conventional building codes. To some extent, many if not most buildings can be considered green. See Allan M. Bilka, Int'l Code Council, ICC Green Building White Paper 1-2 (2007), available at http://www.iccsafe.org/news/green/ICC_Green_ Building_White_Paper.pdf; see also Int'l Code Council, ICC Green Building White Paper H: The Case for the International Codes as the Foundation for Green And Sustainable Building Programs and Standards, available at www.iccsafe.org/news/green/ICC_Green_ Building_White_Paper2.pdf. Green building, however, is based less on specific practices than it is on general principles, encouragement for innovation, and ideals of quality of life within a larger community. This is not to say that they are necessarily incompatible or contrary to one another. Nevertheless, the two are distinct, which provides an important point about green building: As the green building movement presented itself in an already existing, developed industry of construction, it was apparent that the ideas in green building were new. 29 U.S. Green Bldg.

Of the different rating systems, LEED, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is the most prevalent so far.31 Among the different LEED systems, LEED for New Construction and Major Renovations (LEED NC)32 has been the most frequently employed due in large part to its age and subject matter.33 However, because this Article is as much concerned with the benefits of green home construction, the analysis of green building applications will also discuss LEED for Homes. In both systems, LEED scores the building in six categories: Sustainable Sites (SS), Water Efficiency (WE), Energy and Atmosphere (EA), Materials and Resources (MR), Indoor Environmental Quality (EQ), and Innovation and Design Process (ID).34 LEED for Homes considers two additional categories of greenness, Location and Linkages (LL) and Awareness and Education (AE), and also makes adjustments for home size (in recognition that a smaller home, on average, will impose less of an impact on most of the green categories over the lifecycle of the structure).35 The first category in green construction is identified as the Sustainable Sites element, which focuses builders36 on minimizing damage to the environmental characteristics of a given building site.37 This element favors building locations that "do not include sensitive site elements and restrictive land types"38 (e.g., sites rating high in ecosystem services, such as high- functioning wetlands, floodplains, and other natural areas), locations that 30 LEED for Homes, supra note 29 ("By recognizing sustainable design and construction in homes nationwide . . . homebuyers can more readily identify third-party verified green homes."). 31 The USGBC is a nonprofit organization comprised of various members from all aspects of the building industry.

Examining the Revolution of Green in Building Practices Codes seem to come into being after we have experienced a problem, even an unfortunately grave one. And from the beginning, codes have their origin in the notion that we are interdependent. One must be regulated for the good of all. Because of this forced imposition of the majority's good on the property owner there is a natural reluctance to impose building laws; and when they are enacted, they are often after the fact, curing the ills of yesterday's technology, rather than tomorrow's.79 The problem with new ideas is seldom whether they are strong or otherwise well reasoned - the problem with new ideas is always that they are in fact new.80 In the case of social conventions, it takes time for new ideas to either "fit" into existing perspectives, or alternatively, to replace existing beliefs.81 It is the same in law, and indeed, the development of green building laws demonstrates a triumph of green building over its status as both a new idea and a green idea. The success er'joyed by green building is illustrated by looking into the chalฤผenges facing the movement. A. Challenges to Overcome Building codes82 have traditionally been based on the need to protect the health, safety, and welfare of inhabitants.83 Through the ages, building 78 See generally LEED for Homes, supra note 29, at 101-04. 79 Stephen Tobriner, The History of Building Codes to the 1920s , in Proceedings of the Structural Engineers Association of California: 1984 Convention 49, 56 (1984). 80 Although this statement may seem fairly obvious, elsewhere I have argued that this circumstance provides a persuasive reason to think strategically rather than dogmatically about resolving our environmental problems. See Keith H. Hirokawa, Some Pragmatic Observations About Radical Critique in Environmental Law, 21 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 225, 260 (2002). It seems reasonable to suggest that the lesson should also be applied when assessing the efforts of new movements to change social and legal conventions. 81 Id. 82 Gaylon Claiborne explains, Building codes are sets of legal requirements having to do with the physical structure of buildings, primarily new buildings. There are several areas of code administration that are closely associรกted with building codes and should properly be included as part of it. These are the electrical code, the plumbing code, and the mechanical code. Related areas of code administration that are generally not included are the housing code, which emphasizes healthful living, and the zoning code, which emphasizes a desirable municipal environment.

S3 Id.</page><page sequence="14">520 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 codes have been employed to prohibit certain flammable materials in building construction, to provide minimum stabilization standards, and even to allocate the use of rain water off of roofs.84 By the twentieth century, building regulations were well beyond fire safety, having expanded into plumbing design, weight loads for certain materials, heating and ventilation systems, and other identifiable, objectively ascertainable goals.85 The standards comprising modern building codes are typically classified as either performance standards or prescriptive standards.86 Performance standards are, in general, more flexible. In most performance standards, a stated result is required, with some flexibility in accomplishing that result.87 Therefore, a performance standard might specify a given load or carrying capacity of a wall, with the builder left to determine which materials, design, or methods will be used to accomplish that load capacity. An early example of a performance standard, albeit one that established liability rather than expressed a regulatory purpose, is found in the Code of Hammurabi: "[I]f a builder builds a house . . . and the house . . . collapse[s] and cause[s] the death of the owner of the house [then] that builder shall be put to death."88 Building codes have tended to be prescriptive in nature, dictating certain methods, designs, and materials, to the exclusion of others. For example, a prescriptive standard might call for certain dimensions in the support structure of a wall, certain doorway dimensions, or certain types of insulation materials.89 Because prescriptive rules are clear and closed to creative interpretation, building officials (and, in all likelihood, the insurance industry) understandably prefer these "[r]ules that are clear and reasonable [and therefore] easy to enforce."90 In addition, prescriptive rules provide some certainty in the uniform structural integrity of buildings.91 In early green construction projects, prescriptive codes were problematic precisely because green builders represented the notion that past practices were not working.92 New, innovative designs were needed, 84 Tobriner, supra note 79, at 50. 85 Id. 86 Robert C. Levy, Home Rule, Uniformity, and Performance Standards in Codes , in 1 Readings in Code Administration, supra note 82, at 69, 73 (discussing the tension between the need for uniformity in setting prescriptive standards and the draw of subjectivity in performance standards). 87 Id. 88 Tobriner, supra note 79, at 49 (quoting the Code of Hammurabi). 89 See, e.g. , Fedus v.

Even worse, as in the typical circumstance of new building materials, "the building official often [is] technically and professionally unqualified to evaluate the factual supporting data that may have been submitted."94 Moreover, even where builders were able to argue under the infrequent alternative, performance-based standards in conventional building codes, builders were required to show - with reports, tests, or some evidentiary support - that the innovative use of materials or designs would in fact perform to the level demanded.96 The obvious dilemma for early green builders was the absence of an existing or pervasive market for green building materials or designs.96 The resulting lack of experience, models, examples, or data was a significant obstacle in the permitting process.97 There was little opportunity to develop information on such practices, such as comparative data on costs, materials, designs, or expected benefits.98 Where "green" building materials were available, an informational discord shaped the uncertainty of consumers in what they were buying.99 As a result, green builders faced practical challenges in supporting their proposed green buildings.100 In addition to the more obvious obstruction that building codes posed, green builders also faced at least four fundamental, essentially social roadblocks to the acceptance of these new ideas: information, leadership, liability, and cost. 1. Information The green building movement could not have developed merely on the basis of its goals; merely proclaiming the goal of resource efficiency does not imply that we know how to accomplish that feat. In the experiments 93 See id. 94 Verner L. Lane, Code Problems and New Fastening Methods for Wood ' in 3 Readings in Code Administration, supra note 82, at 191, 193 (arguing that only a performance based building code will allow for the acceptance of innovative techniques and building materials). 95 Id. 96 See generally id. 97 See, e.g., Kelly Lemons, Permitting Green Projects: City Undergoing Greening Pains in Permit Process, Bellingham Bus.

Leadership The acceptance of new practice and ideas is likely contingent upon effective leadership from professionals in the industry.108 Professional 101 Hence, Edna Sussman opens her article on green building with a story about Al Gore's difficulties in acquiring permits to install solar panels on his home; apparently, the local building code did not permit solar panels, and the subsequent appeal to the legislative body to amend the otherwise inflexible building code was frustrating. Sussman, supra note 9, at 1. Al Gore's experience is not unique. Early surveys on the perceived obstructions to green building efforts showed code inflexibility in prescriptive building requirements as a m^jor contributing disincentive to green buildings. See, e.g. , David Eisenberg et al., Breaking Down the Barriers: Challenges and Solutions to Code Approval of Green Building 1 (2002), available at http://www.dcat.net/resources/breaking_down_barriers.pdf (reporting the results of an industry- wide survey to determine the primaiy causes of green building application obstructions). 102 See generally Eisenberg et al., supra note 101, at 2, 21 (noting that green alternatives are often denied approval because of a lack of supporting information about the product, materials, system, or design that can satisfy safety concerns). 103 Id. at 21. 104 See id. ("Applications are more likely to be denied ... if they lack sufficient supporting information about the green product, material, system, or design to satisfy safety concerns."). 105 See id. at 14 (explaining that code officials blamed denial of green alternatives on "lack of adequate supporting information" and "insufficient technical knowledge," thereby stifling green development). 106 See, e.g., Secretariat of the Comm'n for Envtl.

See generally Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions 6 (2d ed. 1970) ("The extraordinary episodes in which that shift of professional commitments occurs</page><page sequence="17">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 523 education, including some handholding for the uninitiated, is a necessary component of adaptation from conventional building codes to green building practices. Green building clearly needed influential leaders to effectively advocate for and manage the transition and transfer of knowledge as building practices adapted to these new ideas. The dilemma in leadership, as with other hurdles for green building, was bounded by informational limitations, which then translated into a lack of consensus on the goals of green building.109 Without marketable building materials, green building was largely uneventful. Without examples, experiments, and other models for innovation, there was no information on the proposals. Without information, there were few who could lead builders into the green building movement. 3. Liability Concerns In the informational divide, alternative building methods, designs, and materials could reasonably be understood to pose a liability risk. For instance, the implied warranties of quality that often accompany new home construction110 raised a daunting uncertainty over whether the construction quality of newly constructed green homes will be measured on the same standards as conventionally constructed homes or (more likely) a much higher standard which incorporรขtes the expectations attendant to "high performance" homes.111 In such cases, do the implied warranties act to guarantee lower energy costs, higher performance for indoor air quality, or a set percentage of water or energy efficiency? How long would such warranty - and the uncertainties inhering in it - pervade if a building began to fail (say, if it was only 20% more efficient than a conventional building) in five years? Moreover, given that green buildings were initially (and to some extent remain) plagued with a lack of information regarding the performance expectation of particular green materials designs, what types are the ones known in this essay as scientific revolutions."). Other disciplines and professions face similar circumstances. Id. 109 See Alex Tynberg, The Natural Step and Its Implication for a Sustainable Future , 7 Hastings W.-Nw. J. Envtl. L. &amp; Pol'y 73, 73 ("The current economic and legal system in the United States fails to guide society towards a sustainable future."). In his introduction, Tynberg emphasized that M[t]he key to achieving sustainability is to change the practices of commerce, which presently exist unencumbered by real connections to the environment." Id. no por instance, warranties of habitability and workmanlike construction have applied in many instances to the fitness of new construction for purposes of habitation to reflect the unequal bargaining power of the parties and the importance of safety in the construction industry. See, e.g., McDonald v. Mianecki, 398 A.2d 1283, 1292 (N.J. 1979) (finding an implied warranty of habitability and workmanship in builder-vendor construction contracts); Groff v. Pete Kingsley Bldg., Inc., 543 A.2d 128, 131-32 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988) (holding that a construction contract between builder and layperson included an implied warranty of habitability and workmanship due, in part, to the unequal bargaining power of the parties). 111 See, e.g., U.S. Green Bldg. Council, LEED Rating Systems, http://www.usgbc.org/ DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222 (last visited July 19, 2009) (explaining its rating system for green buildings as the "nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high performance green buildings").</page><page sequence="18">524 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 of disclosure are required? Would builders need to warranty the acquisition of recycled building materials from a certifiable source?112 Would builders be required to identify chemicals useรงl to treat building materials? Because green building applications require analysis of alternative building standards, are builders at risk of negligence in seeking approval of alternative standards?113 The contract possibilities raise related health and construction quality fears, but could extend into new potential implied warranties; assuming that green building is marketable for, at the least, providing certain benefits beyond typical building codes, what warranty is appropriate for the delivery of these benefits? If a builder is marketing a building as "green" based on, for instance, energy and water performance, indoor air quality, and materials, to what degree can performance standards of "greenness" apply? The contract fear (including architects, builders, and homeowners), then, includes the difficulty of contracting for and around performance standards for energy efficiency, indoor pollution, emissions, and water usage, among others. Moreover, it remains uncertain that green buildings will perform uniformly to provide these benefits.114 Finally, the introduction of green building standards in the construction process also functions at the financial level of the construction industry.115 At least, lenders must face the dilemma of determining how to assess the value 112 There may have been (and may continue to be) fear about whether laws regulating deceptive trade practices would be applicable to green building standards. Deceptive trade practices legislation currently addresses standards for organic foods; will it apply (and how) to green building? See, e.g., Alaska Stat. ยง 17.06.010 (2008) (statute on organic food labeling); see also Claudia L. Andrรฉ, Comment, What's In That Guacamole? How Bates and the Power of Preemption Will Affect Litigation Against the Food Industry, ; 15 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 227, 228 (2007) (examining consumer protection litigation over misleading product labeling); Delcianna J.

Rev. 454, 456 (2006) (examining legal tools for strengthening rules on representations in product labeling concerning animal testing and cruelty). 113 Historically, building code violations could constitute negligence per se. See, e.g. Real Estate Mktg., Inc. v. Franz, 885 S.W.2d 921, 927 (Ky. 1994). On the other hand, compliance with building codes constitutes a significant defense. Which applies to a building constructed to alternative, performance-based standards? In all likelihood, green buildings will be subject to the same litigation over negligence through which any alternative building method would suffer. See, e.g., Davis v. Fischer Single Family Homes, Ltd., 231 S.W.3d 767, 777 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007) (submitting to the jury the question of building code violation where the applicable building code provision allowed for alternative use of "materials and methods which substantially comply with the spirit of the code"). In such a context, it will be little reprieve to know that plaintiffs will bear the burden of demonstrating causation. 114 Building officials might legitimately fear claims of negligent review and enforcement of conventional building code standards. Despite the protections afforded to municipal officials (public duty doctrine), the risk of liability based on an informational gap can be daunting. See, e.g., Brown v. Syson, 663 P.2d 251, 252 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1983) (applying negligence principles to the exercise of building official's duties); Butler v. Bogdanovich, 705 P.2d 662, 663 (Nev. 1985) (indicating that a duty of care is owed in inspecting building for defects). 115 See generally Geoff White, The Legal Issues of Green Real Estate Finance ; Green Real Estate L.J., Jan. 23, 2009, http://www.greenrealestatelaw.com/2009/01/legal-issues-of-green-real- estate-finance (last visited July 19, 2009) (identifying some of the threshold liability issues concerning lenders and recommending that lenders convene a "green team" so that certification and operational issues will be understood).</page><page sequence="19">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 525 added in green buildings.116 Assuming conventional building standards establish baseline values for comparability, what effect might alternative, green performance standards have on market value analysis? Should different market standards apply? These questions may be answered in time, but in the meantime, it is reasonable to ask whether the informational gaps in the stated benefits of green certification might fail to correspond to market value, particularly given the difficulties of assessing the impact of green building standards on the costs of home construction. In the absence of an established framework for assessing these added amenities, all players in the construction market have been frustrated with expectations in green buildings as investment opportunities. The uncertainty is exacerbated by the hesitancy of a lender to finance construction that is intended to reflect something other than conventional building codes.117 4. Building Costs, Perceived and Real Without a track record or base of data, green buildings have been thought - whether merely perceived or real - to dramatically increase the cost of home building.118 In the absence of a lucrative market for development of green building technology, green building might have been unable to overcome the perceived costs. Few green buildings were being built.119 Without new green building construction, the industry was not generating data to use in understanding or advancing green building methods.120 In the meantime, building inspectors and building officials remained uninformed on such methods, as they were not gaining experience.121 The resistance to higher performance buildings was self-perpetuating. In reality, costs were as simple to exaggerate as they were to calculate. These costs come in several forms, such as the task of acquiring alternative but unproven "green" materials and designs, the dilemmas in convincing building officials that particular materials or designs would meet existing, prescriptive building code standards, and the added time needed to overcome these challenges.122 Then, for the excessive amount of time and effort needed to convince a building official on the sustainability of a 116 See id. 117 See Eisenberg et al., supra note 101, at 14. 118 E.g. :, BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 7 ("[The initial] inability to convert general client interest in sustainability into a more substantial amount of work may be linked to client concerns over the up-front cost of green buildings."); Greg Kats, The Costs and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings: A Report to California's Sustainable Building Task Force 12 (2003), available at http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/greenbuilding/Design/CostBenefit/Report.pdf ("There has been a widespread perception in the real estate industry that building green is significantly more expensive than the traditional methods of development."); Swing, supra note 3, at 49, 52 (recognizing that one of the initial hurdles for green building is to deal with the "perceived 'green premium'"). 1 19 See BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 4. 120 See generally Kats, supra note 118, at 12-13 (describing some of the barriers to obtaining information on green building, particularly with respect to costs); cf. id. at 11 (suggesting the importance of the increasing availability of data in the emerging green building industry). 121 See Eisenberg et al., supra note 101, at 14. 122 5eeBDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 4; Eisenberg et al., supra note 101, at 14, 17.</page><page sequence="20">526 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 particular method, design, or material, the costs of building increase. The costs of delay, the costs of investigation, and ultimately, the costs of compliance would reduce the financial incentives for such projects. Even after shouldering the burden of these costs, builders were not assured that, after the effort, the proposal would be approved.123 As a result, builders advanced the perception that green building was more expensive than conventional building methods.124 It was assumed that green building standards would create an upfront cost increase of twenty to twenty-five percent.125 B. The Informational Approach to Green Building The first generation of green building laws might be best described as a movement inspired by the possibility of overcoming uncertainty, and the laws were designed to address a critical lack of information. Green building laws needed to educate builders and building officials about green building issues, despite the absence of an active market for green building services and with the mechanics of green construction largely undeveloped. Despite challenges, informational green building laws are proving to be overwhelmingly successful. At least four specific projects implemented by state and local governments are contributing to this success: first, the private sector has taken an active leadership role in developing green building codes to standardize green building methods; second, local governments have adopted voluntary, incentive-based green building standards for private buildings;126 third, state and local governments have adopted laws requiring public buildings and other construction to meet green building standards;127 and finally, green building laws have often been accompanied by outreach programs to educate public officials, builders, and the general public on the benefits, costs, and processes of green building.128 Although each component of early green building laws has been significant on its own, the combined effect has been to generate the information needed to close the gap between green building goals and methods, and has meanwhile made green building a credible and worthwhile movement. 123 See Eisenberg et al., supra note 101, at 16. 124 See, e.g., BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 4 ("The launch of LEED for New Construction in 2000 was accompanied by dire predictions in some quarters of the construction industry that LEED buildings could cost 20-25% more than conventional buildings."). 125 Id. 126 Not all of the early green building laws have been voluntary.

Leadership from the Building Community: LEED and Beyond Green building owes its very existence to the promulgation of green building standards by private and cooperative efforts. Green building collaboration has produced several systems of performance rating and guidance to determine how green a building may be. The most prevalent, of course, is the market-driven rating system promulgated as the LEED standards by the USGBC.129 Also significant are the Green Globes green rating program,130 the Energy Star products marketing program administered by EPA,131 the guidance provided by the National Association of Homebuilders132 (NAHB), and the many (and still growing) local and regional green building programs, including EarthCraft House133 and Build It Green.134 129 At present, the most widely employed standard in state and local legislation is the LEED certification, first promulgated by the USGBC as a pilot program in 1998. See Chris W. Scheuer &amp; Gregory A. Keoleian, Nat'l Inst, of Standards &amp; Tech., Evaluation of Leed Using Life Cycle Assessment Methods 16-17 (2002), available at http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/ publications/gcrs/02836.pdf. LEED currently boasts six related but separate programs, including neighborhood development, homes, commercial, and home renovation, among others, with some programs currently in pilot stage. 5eeU.S. Green Bldg. Council, supra note 111. 130 The Green Globes program was developed by the Green Building Initiative (GBI), a non- profit organization which has as its purpose the implementation of healthier and more sustainable building practices.

Id. 132 The National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB), although a latecomer relative to the other associations, has provided insightful guidance in the Model Green Home Building Guidelines, which reaches deep into the principles of green building. Like the LEED programs, the NAHB guidelines organize green building into separate but related principles: lot design, preparation, and development; resource efficiency; energy efficiency; water efficiency; environmental quality; operation, maintenance, and homeowner education; global impact; and site planning and land development. See Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders, NAHB Model Green Home Building Guidelines 1-4 (2006), available at http://www.nahbgreen.org/contenty pdf/nahb _guidelines.pdf. The NAHB guidelines further emphasize the advantages of converting to green building or making the choice to build green. See id.

The purpose of these projects has been to develop new building standards to provide an objective, voluntary, and market-driven rating system to help define and measure the benefits attributable to green building practices.135 As discussed above, the application of these standards in the regulation of the building process has been to transform our consumptive practices within our homes. Common among these programs is the attempt to standardize the process of comparing and measuring the green performance attainable by particular buildings. To accomplish this feat, green standards are based on a complex point system under which credit is awarded for innovation in design, use of recycled construction materials, energy efficiency, indoor air quality (materials used), location, water use, and emissions.136 Because measurement in green performance is an evolving science, the use of standards rather than set code rules incorporates needed flexibility into the process of identifying green design, methods, materials, and means. Also common among these green building programs is flexibility. Because green performance measurement of the built environment is an evolving science, and because of the felt need to include so many varying locational, media, anthropocentric, and other factors,137 the use of standards rather than set code rules should not be surprising. On the other hand, one may be surprised to find that, as a result of the flexibility and adaptability of most green building criteria, it is possible to find two different buildings achieving equal green status in entirely different ways: perhaps one resulting from exceptional energy efficiency, another from design and choice of July 19, 2009); EarthCraft House, EarthCraft House Guidelines Overview, http://www.earthcraft house.com/About/criteria.htm (last visited July 19, 2009). 134 Build It Green, a nonprofit organization in Alameda County, California, first designed a Green Building program in 2000 intended to serve multiple objectives, including use as an educational tool for local governments, builders, and homeowners; presentation of flexible foundations in accomplishing the goals of green building; and creation of a uniform set of guidelines built upon the collaboration of government and building industry experts. See Build It Green, supra note 63, at 4. Among other things, the Build It Green guidelines are as user- friendly as they are comprehensive and specific in identifying the elements of building design and construction which can contribute to green building objectives. In large part, the success of Built It Green is attributable to the collaborative process in its development, calling on representatives from builders, local governments, and green building experts. See id. Build It Green identifies four fundamental and converging objectives to guide application of green building concepts: conserve natural resources, use energy wisely, improve indoor air quality, and plan for livable communities. Id. at 9. Build It Green focuses on the manner in which these objectives converge and on the methods used to achieve them. For instance, use of recycled building materials can concurrently conserve forest resources, reduce indoor emissions from new building materials, and can even extend the life expectancy of a building.

Voluntary and Incentive Programs for Private Builders A significant aspect of green building programs is that they were largely introduced as voluntary to builders on private construction projects.139 Local governments have entertained and, in some cases, encouraged the use of green building methods.140 In some cases, the very act of allowing builders to seek green building benefits has effected a more flexible approach to conventional building code limitations.141 In others, green building standards have been encouraged by the use of specific incentives.142 Some local governments have opted to provide multidimensional incentive approaches to encourage green building. For instance, Gainesville, Florida, offers a voluntary green building program that incorporates a variety of incentives to encourage the private sector to engage in green practices.143 Among other things, Gainesville offers several "green building awards," fast-track building permit review, and reduced permitting fees (50% of building permit fee applicable to conventional buildings).144 Those private projects involving multifamily residential retrofitting or remodeling may take advantage of additional incentives, identified as a "cash renovation incentive" and a "solar water heater incentive."145 Finally, Gainesville also promises to provide a variety of free marketing incentives for private green projects, including posting building site signs to advertise the project under the green program, inclusion in the city's program webpage, provision of promotional packages (such as a program logo) for private use in advertisements, press releases, and information about available financial programs.146 Likewise, Sarasota County, Florida, expects to provide a flurry of incentives to encourage builders to participate in the green building 138 Examples of this flexibility are documented in Davis Langdon's report, which points out that (not surprisingly) many of the choices in green standard compliance are driven by increases in building costs.

Voluntary Green Building Codes Early green builders were faced with the significant challenge of being proponents of innovative ideas and designs that were not established and proven ideas and designs.149 Indeed, in many cases, the goals sought by green builders fell outside of the regulatory schemes in building codes.150 When green building codes such as LEED and Build It Green began to be incorporated into local laws, builders were not required to build green.151 Rather, early green building laws merely encouraged builders to do so.152 Hence, the subjects and techniques associated with green building goals have generally operated to supplement, rather than supplant, building code requirements. As building code supplements, the task of voluntary green building laws has been to link the goals of green building with the means of accomplishing those goals. Because voluntary green building codes have been based on performance standards, builders could approach their projects as experimental, innovative, and progressive. b. Expedited Review In most developments, time delay during the governmental review of development applications can be cumbersome and costly.153 Accordingly, expedited review of a building or other development applications can provide a significant incentive by shortening the administrative process, thereby reducing the time to market. Several state154 and local governments155 147 Sarasota County, Fla., Res. 2005-048 (Mar. 15, 2005), available at http://www.scgov.net/ Sustainability/documents/GreenBldg2005048.pdf. 148 id 149 See supra Part IH. A. 150 One significant development in green building codes is the expansion of the scope of building code review. Traditionally, although building codes may have exhibited broad goals, the exact subject matters of regulations have been quite limited. See Claiborne, supra note 82, at 33 (discussing the limitations on the domain of the code; for example, in considering a risk of fire, it may be outside of the scope of the building code to regulate the provision of fire services, or even the source of ignition of fire, such as by use of cigarette lighters indoors). 151 See, e.g., Circo, supra note 139, at 753-54 (noting that most jurisdictions that have enacted mandatory green building standards have primarily applied the mandates to "public projects and those that use public funds," rather than the private sector). 152 id 153 Ctr. for Hous.

There is some variation in the approach, particularly in the identified direct beneficiary,171 but each attempt is intended to make green building compliance more attractive.

Leadership by Example One of the most notable examples of green building laws implements the notion that government can - or should - be a driving force in the evolution toward cleaner and healthier building practices. Governmental entities at all levels have adopted laws and policies requiring that publicly owned buildings be constructed and even retrofitted to meet green building standards.180 In some instances, states,181 counties, and cities have even specified high LEED standards for public buildings.182 The clear intent of this planning/zoning/pdfs/Ordinance_Section36.pdf (allowing additional height for proposals that meet a minimum LEED certified status). 179 West Hollywood, Cal., Ordinance 07-762 ยง 6 (July 16, 2007), available at http://www.weho. org/media/File/GreenbuildingOrdinance.pdf. 180 The federal commitment, which has resulted in LEED rating of buildings managed by the National Park Service, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Department of State, Department of Energy, and others, has been advancรฉd somewhat by executive order.

The city converted its bus fleet from diesel to compressed natural gas to reduce air emissions from public vehicles.193 In coi'junction with the vehicle conversion, the city sought to design and construct a new transit maintenance facility to meet high LEED standards.194 The result of this effort was one of the first Gold-rated, LEED-certified straw buildings in the world.195 Of course, the project was troubled by an initial lack of familiarity with green building strategies, but early efforts to integrate and coordinate the various areas of expertise that participants brought to the project effectively navigated the uncertainties of green building goals.196 The project ultimately incorporated a "less is more" strategy in the materials chosen to construct the facility, the building fixtures, and operational designs of the building to reduce maintenance costs over time.197 Design choices were made to reduce water consumption (e.g., drought-tolerant, native plantings), reduce site impacts (e.g., close to regional transportation corridors), and decrease energy dependency (designed to maximize natural light and ventilation resources).198 The city also committed to on-site energy production and continuous monitoring to identify, quantify, and maintain the benefits of its green building strategy.199 The structure is further highlighted in explanatory materials and self-guided tours of the facility that showcase the structure's features and accomplishments.200 193 Charles R.

Green Building Education A final interesting development in green building laws has been the incorporation of green building education. Given that green building was developed within a framework plagued by informational deficiencies,201 the educational initiative might be seen as a necessary component to the success of the movement. To combat the informational problem, some entities provide information to the general public, while others provide specific consulting assistance to builders on meeting the requirements of high performing, green buildings.202 Under these laws, local building departments may provide consulting on private projects and instruction on how green building standards can be met on a project-specific basis.203 The City of Frisco, Texas, hosts accredited educational programs to provide information on green building initiatives.204 King County, Washington, established a green building team to provide education and guidance to county governmental departments on achieving and implementing green building goals.205 Oakland, California, provides technical assistance to builders of green projects and publicly promotes green projects for builders.206 C. Successes of the Informational Approach The green building movement has had a great start.207 At the least, owners of homes and commercial buildings have sought green building 201 See supra Part III.

See Sara C. Bronin, The Quiet Revolution Revived: Sustainable Design, Land Use Regulation, and the States , 93 Minn. L. Rev. 231, 259 (2008) ("Despite examples of successful local reform, very few localities have taken steps to amend existing laws or to create new laws which address green building. Institutional inertia serves as a key obstacle: simply put, local government officials resist change."). The difference between Bronin's analysis and that offered in this Article may be based on a divergence in how we measure success. This Article assumes that a movement that is able to face an adverse presumption and capture even a minority market share in construction and building sales, as well as the attention of consumers, materials producers, and state and local legislators, is worthy of attention; Bronin appears to defer judgment until green building is either universally mandated or constitutes a majority of building construction. See id. at 249-50.</page><page sequence="34">540 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 benefits in significant numbers.208 As early as 2006, industry observers noted that, "[w]hat started out as a charismatic crusade had matured into an established sector of the U.S. construction industry."209 Arguably at least, laws concerned with environmental quality have never experienced nor expected this type of interest in compliance, and certainly not from all sectors (political, industry, and consumer) at the same time. The easiest explanation for the interest in green building can be found in the manner in which information was obtained through green building experimentation - using a carrot instead of a stick.210 The information-gathering exercise of early green building laws produced knowledge for overcoming the prescriptive inclination behind conventional building codes and fitting the innovative ideas of green building into a regulatory process otherwise governed by prescriptive building codes.211 In a sense, green building has become compatible with conventional building methods, primarily through a better understanding of how to build green. Of course, this understanding is slow to come.212 Specifically, as more projects have been completed, and more green building methods have been explored, the extraordinary informational effect of green building has been an understanding of the costs of building green and a verification of green building benefits. So, we are now building green because of what green building has to offer. Not surprisingly, the practical successes of early green building laws include the experience gained from actually engaging green building standards. First, even if experiences in green building had been limited to the construction of publicly-owned buildings, we would have emerged from the informational laws with a host of experienced building officials, who are able to guide builders more effectively through building code review based on alternative code and performance standards. Experienced builders can meanwhile manage inexperienced building officials more effectively to avoid denial of a project based on lack of understanding. Experienced builders can also more accurately account for the costs and pitfalls of the green building process. In this regard, it is significant that the green building movement has produced "green building codes" - incorporating both performance and prescriptive standards - that could be relied upon by builders and officials 208 USGBC estimates that its membership has more than quadrupled since 2000. See U.S. Green Bldg. Council, Green Building by the Numbers 1 (2009), available aยฟhttp://www.usgbc. org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=3340. In 2008, USBGC reported that LEED workshops were attended by over 90,000 people, that there were 80,000 accredited LEED professionals, and that the number of attendees at Greenbuild increased by over 5000 people between 2007 to 2008.

The effect of standardization in green building has made the movement accessible, realistic, and credible. Although obvious, this informational development, primarily affecting knowledge of the building process itself and the products at issue, should not be underestimated.213 Second, as green buildings have been occupied, it appears that the projected benefits of green building principles - efficiency, health, direct and indirect impacts on the environment, and cost - are being verified.214 Therefore, in what is apparently the most comprehensive study to date of LEED building performance, the New Buildings Institute reports that "[e]ach of three views of building performance show average LEED energy use 25- 30% better than the national average, a level similar to that anticipated by LEED modeling."215 The cost of building maintenance and operation, in the form of reduced utility bills and maintenance costs, has meanwhile excited consumers in the market.216 Likewise, in a typical story on the health benefits of green buildings, it is difficult to identify a loser: What is being said about green building benefits? Occupants report improved comfort, convenience and worker performance. Owners reduce operating expenses for utilities, repairs and maintenance while increasing their lease rates and occupancy. Developers dispose of their commercial space faster than their competitors - at higher lease rates or higher sales prices. Real estate investors net greater returns.217 The information gathered so far on the projected health and productivity benefits of green buildings is understandably light.218 However, the early results are impressive and promising. One review, undertaken to 213 Removing this obstacle to green building, and making it easier to implement the principles of green building, may have been the most important development in the movement. See generally Ann E. Carlson, Recycling Norms ; 89 Cal. L. Rev. 1231, 1236 (2001) ("Though social norms can, and sometimes do, play a role in encouraging cooperative behavior . . . their force is limited.

Notwithstanding the costs attributable to green features - design, materials, and the cost of the certification process - green building certification has been found to cause only a negligible increase in upfront building costs.224 A California study prepared in 2003, entitled The Costs and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings , found that: [T]he average premium for . . . green buildings is slightly less than 2% [or $3-$5 per square foot], substantially lower than is commonly perceived. The msyority of this cost is due to the increased architectural and engineering . . . design time necessary to integrate sustainable building practices into projects. Generally, the earlier green building gets incorporated into the design process, the lower the cost.225 219 See William J. Fisk, Health and Productivity Gains from Better Indoor Environments and Their Relationship with Building Energy Efficiency. 25 Ann. Rev.

Some estimates of upfront green building costs indicate a range of 3-5% above comparable market prices for buildings meeting conventional building codes. Other assessments of green building costs describe the transition to green building as entirely benign. For instance, in July of 2007, Davis Langdon published the Cost of Green Revisited: Reexamining the Feasibility and Cost Impact of Sustainable Design in the Light of Increased Market Adoption , which is based on a review of buildings designed and constructed to implement green building methods and achieve LEED green building standards. Langdon, Cost of Green Revisited, supra note 138, at 4.

The Davis Langdon report compared green buildings versus</page><page sequence="37">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 543 The time factor of green integration decreases as architects, engineers, builders, and building officials gain experience,226 and so it makes sense that the cost of building green decreased in correlation to the number of public green buildings constructed and private green building incentives used. In addition, given the above-described findings on the consistent energy performance of green buildings, any remaining increased front-end costs may be offset in large part over the lifetime of the structure, such as in utility savings and saved medical expenses. The explosion of market activity seen in green building has not gone unnoticed on Wall Street. Over the last several years, a growing number of financial institutions and private investors have seized upon the popularity of green building to develop green marketing strategies and "socially responsible" investment products.227 In the midst of generating green building information, the financial acquiescence is described as a reasonable reaction to market growth: "What happened is that the financial sector of the real estate industry, heretofore a casual bystander, suddenly woke up to green building - not necessarily because its members had miraculously developed an insatiable urge to save the planet, but because they had begun to see a viable new investment opportunity."228 Finally, it is notable that, as of this date, there are no reported decisions on builders (or anyone, for that matter) challenging the imposition of green comparable non-green buildings based on three elements of project management: the cost attributable to green-specific standards of construction, the costs of green buildings compared to similar non-green buildings, and the ability of green projects to meet budgetary expectations. Id. at 3. The conclusions favor green buildings: "[T]here is no significant difference in average costs for green buildings as compared to non-green buildings." Id. 226 6!eeKATS, supra note 118, at 13. 227 See BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 10-15 (discussing the transition in the financial sector toward seeing the "new reality"). Of course, the development of green building should be distinguished from free-market environmentalism. As Barton Thompson states, "The principal purpose of [regulatory] markets is to reduce the cost of environmental regulation by providing the regulated community with greater flexibility." Barton H. Thompson, Jr., Markets for Nature, 25 Wm. &amp; Mary Envtl. L. &amp; Pol'y Rev. 261, 262 (2000). In the case of green building, while it is clear that market factors influenced the direction and speed of success in the movement, the intended direction of green building codes is not toward a free market in building codes. See generally BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 10-15 (providing examples of the financial community's involvement in the development of green building). 228 BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 5 (emphasis added). In a survey by Jones Lang LaSalle, it was reported that 70% of survey respondents globally stated that they were prepared to pay a premium rental for sustainable real estate, 62% that this premium would be in the region of 1-10% more, and a further 8% stating that they would be prepared to pay a double digit premium for appropriate, sustainable solutions. In contrast, and critically, a quarter of respondents maintained that they were not prepared to pay any more for a sustainable solution, irrespective of their views on the costs of delivering such product to the market.

Indeed, there are a handful of cases proceeding that involve (to varying degrees) green building laws or green buildings. See, e.g. , Air Conditioning, Heating &amp; Refrigeration Inst. v. City of Albuquerque, Civ. No. 08-633 MV/RLP (D.N.M. Oct. 3, 2008), available at http://www.nmcourt.fed.us/Drs-WebMew-file?fuU-path-fUename=%2Fdata%2 Fdrs%2Fdm%2Fdocuments%2Fcadd%2F2008%2F10%2F03%2F0001884303-00000000000-08cv00633. pdf (seeking to ei'join enforcement of City of Albuquerque's green building code based on the federal preemption of energy standards in certain heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and water heating products).

Also, it might be interesting to note that while the greenness of a building may provide some mitigation to health and environmental impacts, green buildings will not be immune from "not in my backyard" suits as a matter of mere virtue. See, e.g., Aaron Boyd, Neighbors File Article 78 Against 132 North Main Project; Claim Review Process Flawed, Hamptons.com, Feb. 3, 2009, http://www. hamptons. com/detail. ihtml?id= 6270&amp;apid=12801&amp;sid=35&amp;cid=133&amp;hm=0&amp;iv=0&amp;townflag= Gast visited July 19, 2009) (detailing a lawsuit filed over the approval of a commercial building which obtained LEED certification, but that neighbors alleged would tarnish the neighborhood). 230 Jeff Witt, AICP, who manages the green building program in Frisco, Texas, took some humor at my inquiry into any voiced objections to Frisco's green building laws. Frisco's program, which relies on EnergyStar Compliance, was developed as a collaborative effort among builders, engineers, politicians, and agency personnel, and initially required all subdivisions platted after 2003 to comply with green requirements. Telephone Interview with Jeff Witt, Comprehensive &amp; Envtl. Admin., City of Frisco, in Frisco, Tex. (Jan. 31, 2008). According to Mr. Witt, the only challenge from the building industry came from one builder who did not participate in the development of Frisco's program, and reportedly objected only on principle; after having secured an exemption from the program requirements, the objector then built to green standards anyway. Id. 231 The early success of green buildings also suggests that what is important is that "green building" is not merely an extension of the informational approach seen in other environmental laws. In making this distinction, it seems reasonable to recognize that the administration of environmental regulations has been open to criticism as an opportunity to politicize the scientific process of inquiry and the value of scientific insights in the policy making and regulatory process. See, e.g., Wendy E. Wagner, The Science Charade in Toxic Risk Regulation, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1613, 1617 (1995) (asserting that agencies disguise controversial policy decisions as science). This is a consequence of the design of environmental regulations, which are in large part built upon a need for environmental information as an essential element of the prima facie case for entitlement. Alyson Flournoy suggests that certain informational environmental regulations can be classified as either "information demand" or "information supply" regulations: Demand regulations rely on an agency's consideration of information, either as a procedural step or to apply a particular substantive standard in environmental decision making; supply regulations, on the other hand, relate more specifically to the submission of information for consideration in the regulatory process. Alyson C. Flournoy, Supply, Demand, and Consequences: The Impact of Information Flow on Individual Permitting Decisions Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 83 Ind. L.J. 537, 558-61 (2008). Flournoy argues thรกt one defect in informational regulations is discretion, where agencies may be</page><page sequence="39">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 545 IV. Moving Into Mandatory Green Building Laws and Navigating the Traditional Divide Between Land Use Restrictions and Land Use Rights The steps that governments across the country have taken - and continue to take - demonstrate that the green building movement is no longer a fringe concept espoused solely by environmentalists Those who are quickest to acquire the necessary expertise to assist in this transition to "green" will have earned a distinct advantage.232 Even if only for progress in the development of green building methods, it was expected that the voluntary green building program would eventually incorporate mandatory standards.233 As has been argued, "[a]ll first- generation assessment methods are voluntary in their application - an emphasis that significantly compromises both their comprehensiveness and rigor."234 It should not be surprising, then, that participating state legislatures and local governments have proceeded with confidence to build upon the accomplishments of the informational green building laws in their local regulations and ordinances. Specifically, in many jurisdictions green building is surfacing in mandatory regulatory schemes applicable to the private sector. There are several approaches,235 of course, suggesting that the relatively unchecked if inclined to permit actions that cause otherwise unacceptable environmental degradation. Id. at 570-71. The critique leveled by Wendy Wagner, who argues that the informational process of environmental laws is a charade, seems to converge with Flournoy's by suggesting that an explanation for the correlation between discretion and environmental degradation is found in the manner in which information is used in the regulatory process: Where control of information is causally linked to entitlement in the permitting process, all parties have an incentive to distort, mischaracterize, and even short- shrift the information gathered in a competitive process in which the control of information arguably determines the plausibility of our values. See Wendy E. Wagner, Commons Ignorance: The Failure of Environmental Law to Produce Needed Information on Health and the Environment, 53 Duke L.J. 1619, 1691-95 (2004). Green building laws are distinguishable from the place and purpose of information in this description of environmental regulations. Of course, green building laws often employ both information supply and demand schemes, largely made necessary by the shift to performance, rather than prescriptive, codes to accommodate innovative building practices. See generally supra notes 86-91 and accompanying text (describing performance and prescriptive codes). However, at least in the early efforts, green building laws did not construct a regulatory process in which the informational contingencies determine the policies at issue. See generally supra Part in.A.1 (describing the historical lack of information on green building). That is, in green building, in a manner contrary to other environmental laws, information itself has not been the battleground. 232 Abair, supra note 180, at 632. 233 See Raymond J. Cole, Environmental Performance of Buildings: Setting Goals, Offering Guidance, and Assessing Programs , in Reshaping the Built Environment: Ecology, Ethics, and Economics, supra note 98, at 276, 292. 234 Id 235 It should be noted that although the evolution in this regard is industry-wide, the International Code Council (ICC) took a bit more time in the project of adopting more stringent energy standards for some time and has recognized that much of the current conventional building codes are already or can be adopted to incorporate green standards. See generally Bilka, supra note 28, at 7 ("Some green and sustainable principles have direct impact on or virtually duplicate existing code provisions. In such cases, the greening of the codes may simply be a matter of raising the bars which are already in place in the codes."). Notably, however,</page><page sequence="40">546 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 trajectory of green building laws has been strongly influenced by the applicability of traditional police power authority, the identification of the accumulated information and expertise acquired in earlier green building laws, and the palatability of such laws to those regulated in the various schemes. However, in this paradigm, in which green building concepts become regulatory mandates instead of voluntary aspirations, the pressing question is not whether the local government can offer the opportunity to build green, but whether the local government can require builders to meet high performance building standards.236 A. Requiring Green Building Practices in the Built Environment The most plain and common method of imposing mandatory green construction standards has been through the adoption of mandatory green building codes as a supplement in the building and site plan review process. Among the local laws requiring builders to meet high performance standards, most local green building programs either refer to or require certification through the LEED program.237 However, not all programs have relied on LEED.238 Several local and competing green building standards have surfaced throughout the country, and depending on the palatability of such programs to local politics, there have been varying degrees of local governments have driven into the heart of green building ideas with or without the guidance of the ICC. See generally id. at 2 (noting that "a handful of local jurisdictions have developed their own green building criteria or rating systems"). On January 29, 2009, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved ICC-700, called the "National Green Building Standard," in a joint effort of the ICC and NAHB. See National Green Building Standard ICC-700 Approved ' HousingZone.com, Feb. 3, 2009, http://www.housingzone.com/article/CA 6634369.html (last visited July 19, 2009); Press Release, Naลฅl Ass'n of Home Builders, NAHB Applauds ANSI Approval of National Green Building Standard (Jan. 29, 2009), http://www.nahb. org / news_details.aspx?sectionID=0&amp;newsID=8533 Oast visited July 19, 2009). The National Green Building Standard is the first rating system to be approved by ANSI. Id. 236 Although virtually all of these mandatory programs contain enforcement mechanisms or are made subject to existing building code enforcement, there seems to be little experience at this point in exercising such authority. See BlLKA, supra note 28, at 3. 237 For instance, Montgomery County, Maryland enacted Green Building legislation on November 28, 2006. Montgomery County, Md., Bill No. 17-06 (Nov. 28, 2006), available at http://www.montgomeiycountymd.gov/contentycouncil/pdiySCANNED_DOCS/20061128_17-06.pdf. The county's program applies through all zoning designations and to all new covered buildings exceeding 10,000 square feet, as well as significant structural modifications to such buildings. Id. Construction of public buildings must meet LEED Silver Certifications, and private buildings are required to be LEED certified, with some exceptions. Id. Apparently, to avoid antitrust and nondelegation issues, the legislation vests the county's permitting agency with both approval authority and waiver powers. See also Gaithersburg, Md., Ordinance O-l 1-08 (Sept. 15, 2008) (requiring LEED certification for all buildings equal to or larger than 10,000 square feet, and LEED Silver certification for buildings larger than 99,999 square feet). 238 In several of the programs in which a local, independent rating system has been adopted, applicants are offered the ability to substitute compliance with LEED certification. See, e.g., West Hollywood, Cal., Ordinance 07-762, ยง 6 (July 16, 2007), available at http://www.weho.org/ media/File/GreenbuildingOrdinance.pdf.</page><page sequence="41">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 547 participation and concentration in the elements of green building.239 Moreover, many of these programs have combined the incentives of the informational green building laws with a mandate for certification.240 Others venture to exceed current green standards, such as the announcement in Austin, Texas that all new homes would be "zero energy capable" by 2015.241 Given the systemic approach to minimizing the impact of the building environment, it may not be surprising that green building is also evolving to expand the scope of green building aspirations. As LEED and other programs have matured and expanded, the applicability of green building standards has moved beyond construction materials, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, water conservation, and waste recycling, and into and throughout green neighborhoods.242 LEED for Homes, for instance, encourages development in a characteristically "smart growth" fashion, favoring reuse, redevelopment, infill development, and sites close to existing infrastructure.243 Similarly, in light of the desire that buildings serve a longer 239 For example, the City of Novato, California currently requires all residential construction and renovation to accomplish a minimum score of "Green Building Points." See Novato, Cal., Ordinance 1503, ยง 4-13.3 (Sept. 27, 2005), available at http://www.ci.novato.ca.us/ Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=457.

Among other things, the consideration of several green rating systems in a single program may be intended to overcome the problems that might be encountered by specific designs or in specific locations, given the availability of materials, regional climate factors, and so on. 240 In 2006, Eagle County, Colorado, implemented the Eagle County Efficient Building Code (ECObuild), which purports to apply to all new residential construction and residential expansions exceeding 50% of existing square footprint, as well as nonresidential and mixed-use construction and reconstruction.

Id. ยงยง 4-820 to -830. The prescriptive components of the ECObuild program are supplemented by financial incentives, including possible rebates of 25% (up to $5000) on permit fees as an award for high scores on the rating system, and additional 10% rebates in increments above the minimums, and in part finances these incentives by offering the opportunity to pay a fee in lieu of compliance with the minimum point requirements. See id. ยงยง 4-820, -920. 241 Although "zero energy homes" are equipped to draw from the utility grid, they are intended to produce the energy needed for consumption.

Finally, with the growing trend of Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEP) as an alternative in the enforcement of environmental regulations, green building standards are being considered as a suitable exchange for penalty waivers in cases of regulatory violations and enforcement.254 EPA envisions SEPs as an opportunity to achieve benefits that would otherwise be unavailable, but that arise as "an environmentally beneficial project that a defendant . . . agrees to undertake in settlement of a civil penalty action."255 After toying with the idea, in 2004 EPA established the basic framework for allowing parties to engage in green building projects at contaminated properties in exchange for credit toward the mitigation of penalties.256 The 251 Border Power Plant Working Group v.

Texas allows SEPs as voluntary mitigation efforts, but does not allow a party to use an SEP to meet otherwise required environmental laws, including laws relating to remediation of violations or prior obligations incurred under a preexisting agreement with a governmental agency, and does not allow an SEP project which would directly benefit the violator (or with only limited offset of penalty).

Pub. Res. Code ยงยง 21,000-21,176 (West 2007). The County of San Bernardino prepared an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in conjunction with its General Plan update in March of 2007.

Included in the General Plan update were goals related to improvement of air quality and human health impacts. Id.

Although the settlement agreement does not address green building as mitigation, the attorney general has publicly suggested that the preferred analysis could include green building standards as mitigation. See id. ; Press Release, Office of the</page><page sequence="45">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 551 abstraction and vision typical of comprehensive planning, local governments can inventory emissions, energy and water needs, indoor air quality induced illnesses, and other consumptive and waste-generating activities.261 At this level, the notion of controlling our built ecological footprint is more conceivable, and state and local governments can more fully explore innovation in development codes to match the resource efficiency efforts of green building. We might imagine this form of imposition in comprehensive planning theories to incorporate the lessons of cap-and-trade or transferable development rights that have been tried in other contexts.262 Whichever the direction that such laws travel, however, the trend toward mandatory green building laws suggests that green building has established a solid presence in the building process. B. Will the Imposition Go ' Too Far*? Property Rights and Green Building As suggested above, green building laws have developed in a manner that might be viewed as exemplary; the informational approach to the development of green building practices has excited consumers and builders and created a market (no longer limited to a niche market) for a product that might have been seen as a political ideal, or a personal preference, or simply as an otherwise benign lifestyle choice. It is arguable, in this sense, that green building is distinct from those prior environmental or land use regulations that have defined the property rights battleground ever since the Supreme Court's first application of takings principles to the regulation of property use in Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon ,263 Yet, the transition to green building as an imposition, rather than merely a good idea, may place at risk the advancements made in the movement by putting green building into conflict.264 The question, then, is whether these distinctions will affect the Attorney Gen., State of Cal., Brown Announces Landmark Global Warming Settlement (Aug. 21, 2007), http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1453 Gast visited July 19, 2009). 261 See, e.g., West Hollywood, Cal., Ordinance 07-762, ยง 5 (July 16, 2007), available at http://www.weho.org/media/File/GreenbuildingOrdinance.pdf (recognizing that the city's green building ordinance implements specific goals in its general plan, to "ensure optimal use of scarce energy and water resources"). 262 See generally Robert W. Hahn &amp; Robert N. Stavins, Incentive-Based Environmental Regulation: A New Era From an Old Idea?, 18 Ecology L.Q. 1, 7 (1991) (discussing various forms of incentive-based environmental policies). 263 260 U.S. 393, 393 (1922). 264 Although infrequent (or, at least not out loud), there have been some grumblings in the building industry suggesting that the turn to mandatory green building schemes may be premature or unwise. See, e.g., BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 55 (referring to mandatory green building laws as "the growing danger of 'LEED creep'"). The objection has not yet been well articulated, but the feeling might be captured in the recognition that a mandatory scheme would effectively reallocate control over the choice of innovation, impetus, and direction of green building away from the building industry. Of course, mandatory green building laws would also be likely to neutralize any competitive advantage gained in the project experience of early green builders. Aside from the more self-serving undertones of this reaction, it should be noted that the shift from voluntary to mandatory green building schemes could effect a shift in the social mechanisms that might support the ultimate normative success of green building. In the move from voluntary, incentive-based green building programs to mandatory green building</page><page sequence="46">552 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 39:507 validity of green building laws as they are implemented in state and local governments across the country. Here, we ask whether limitations in the authority of state and local governments prevent, inhibit, or prohibit governments from impeding on the choice of the use, or manner of use, of land: Will green building laws survive land use litigation? Even the most cursory understanding of green building will drive some confusion from this question. As a practical matter, what might such challenges look like? If green buildings were simply subject to the conventional land use framework - such as habitat setbacks, vegetation clearing ordinances, or use restrictions under zoning - then we might look to the usual suspects: regulatory takings, nondelegation,266 constitutional controls on local government authority,266 and others.267 Yet, there have been requirements, there ought to be a searching and significant dialogue on the effect of this shift in the creation and replication of social norms. For purposes here, it might suffice to point out that the excitement demonstrated by consumers to the various voluntary programs and emerging market would lend some support to the social proof theory of norm capture. "Social proof is a notion from social psychology that explains one manner in which we make decisions in instances of uncertainty: We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it. Whether the question is what to do with an empty popcorn box in a movie theater, how fast to drive on a certain stretch of highway, or how to eat chicken at a dinner party, the actions of those around use will be important in defining the answer. Robert B. Cialdini, Influence: How and Why People Agree to Things 117 (1984). Even in jurisdictions where green building standards are not required of builders, it is becoming more commonplace to hear that builders cannot avoid building green: "I don't think I would build a new building right now that's not green, because in five years I may be at a competitive disadvantage." BDC White Paper, supra note 6, at 13. 265 For instance, in some programs, certification is required not from building officials, but through the private code developers, such as the USGBC. See, e.g., Beverly Hills, Cal., Ordinance 08-0-2555 (May 14, 2008), available at http://www.beverlyhills.org/civica/filebank/ blobdload.asp?BlobID=3530#page= (requiring applicants to retain a LEED certified consultant to verify compliance with the green building standards). There may be an open question about nondelegation in this qontext. It could be argued that expedited review and permit fee waivers allocate special privileges to green developers. 266 Green building grants and forgivable loans might raise an understandable (even if difficult) challenge based on the constitutionality of gifts to private parties. Local government incentives in many states are burdened with constitutional prohibitions on loans or gifts to private persons or corporations. See, e.g., Wash. Const, art. Vm, ยง 7 (prohibiting gift of money or property or loan of credit). Of course, the use of federal funds in these assistance projects could avoid such state constitutional difficulties, but the source of federal funds will have its own requirements. For example, Community Development Block Grants are generally for community redevelopment projects, even where the projects are undertaken for communities in need by private parties. U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., Community Development Block Grant Program, http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/communitydevelopmentyprograms (last visited July 19, 2009). Such challenges could conceivably be brought by those builders unwilling to implement green building codes, under the suspicion that the incentives provide an unfair advantage to green builders. However, in Lloyd v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission , 904 A.2d 1010 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2006), plaintiffs challenged the Sustainable Energy Fund, which is funded by a surcharge on power sold to all customers and is intended "to promote the development and use of renewable energy and clean energy technologies, energy and conservation and efficiency which promote clean energy." Id. at 1024 n.22 (quoting the "Joint Petition for Full Settlement of PPL's Restructuring Plan"). The appellant challenging the</page><page sequence="47">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 553 no reported challenges so far.268 Building officials in green building municipalities have reported that, even in the most unlikely settings, builders have cooperated with mandatory green building laws, compelled by the underlying fear of being the only builder in town with "brown" buildings for sale.269 Nevertheless, even if a slight increase in the cost of seeking building permit approval seems de minimis , it might nonetheless be considered an avoidable financial cost (compared to conventional building standards), and could become considerable for larger projects or, in the case of retrofitting inefficient buildings, in any case in which home additions other reconstruction projects trigger green building laws. What is interesting is that, in light of the foregoing, takings claims against green building laws may not be recognized as viable per se.270 The Sustainable Energy Fund alleged that the fund failed to provide demonstrable benefits to ratepayers, and that the fund was a cloaked means to finance private ventures. Id. at 1025. The court affirmed a decision of the public utility commission that the various expenditures of the fund did provide a demonstrable benefit based on several specific fund projects, including the energy savings at LEED certified public buildings, grants to the Green Building Association of Central Pennsylvania to build energy efficiency capacity, and energy management software developed with the help of the fund. Id. at 1026-27. 267 Incentive programs might be vulnerable on several fronts. For example, density incentive programs have been subject to scrutiny on grounds that express enabling authority is needed to justify the exercise. At the same time, however, courts have been willing to find the authority in enabling acts. In Friends of Lagoon Valley v. City of Vacaville, 65 Cal. Rptr. 3d 251 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007), for instance, the court approved a density bonus "higher than the maximum amount set forth in the applicable statute," finding that the expressed maximum was not a ceiling. Id. at 264. In any event, the means by which such bonuses are secured has resulted in closer scrutiny as a method of spot or contract zoning. In Municipal Art Society v. New York ; 522 N.Y.S.2d 800 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1987), the court invalidated a density bonus exchanged for subway improvements and cash payments, finding that: [T]he irayor portion of the benefit which the purchaser is willing to pay for the right to construct a building of greater density than is permitted "as of right" is to be paid to the City to be employed for purposes other than local improvements. A proper quid pro quo for the grant of the right to increase the bulk of a building may not be the payment of additional cash into the City's coffers for citywide use. Id. at 803-04. It certainly could be argued that density bonuses secured for developments that employ green building standards suggest a species of contract zoning. The "amenities" secured by developers employing green building practices may provide public benefits, but those benefits may not be directly related to the impacts of higher densities. 268 See, e.g., supra note 264 (discussing the trend for builders to build green, whether or not they are required to do so). This is easily explainable by the fact that the majority of early green building laws were not regulatory, generally speaking, private action was neither required nor dictated. See, e.g., Circo, supra note 139, at 753-54. As a result, few (if any) could claim ir'jury from the early laws. On the other hand, the early, voluntary green building laws were not (and still are not) completely immune from legal challenges. See, e.g., supra note 267 (discussing challenges to green building standards). 269 Jeff Witt described the isolated instance of a single builder that objected to the adoption of green building standards, contested their application to his development project, and then engaged green building practices to avoid being the only one in town constructing less healthy, less durable, and more costly buildings. Telephone Interview with Jeff Witt, supra note 230. 270 To be sure, it appears that some local governments have learned lessons from past land use regulatory models and have incorporated variance and exception procedures into green building laws to avoid undue hardship claims. For instance, the green building program in</page><page sequence="48">554 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 39:507 lynchpin of takings theory has always revolved around the difficulty of quantifying the Court's "average reciprocity of advantage" rationale for land use regulations.271 Clearly, green building laws provide public benefits in the form of lower public health costs, reduced natural resource consumption, and minimized impacts on climate change.272 At what point might green buildings fail to provide a reciprocal return? Or, more specifically, on what basis might we find that the burden on the individual to build green exacts a public benefit at too unwieldy an individual expense? What injury might be claimed? The advantage that green building laws have over other land use regulatory schemes is that, given the nature of the information gathered in the development of green building ideas, it will be difficult for property owners to make a convincing demonstration that the imposition of green building standards interferes with property rights, much less economic value of the property. Compliance with green building standards provides durable Pleasanton, California, allows an applicant to receive an exemption upon a showing that green compliance is a hardship or otherwise infeasible. Pleasanton, Cal., Mun. Code ยง 17.50.080 (2009), http://qcode.us/codes/pleasanton (last visited July 19, 2009). Applicants may be granted an exemption under adverse circumstances in the "availability of markets for materials to be recycled, availability of green building materials and technologies, and compatibility of Green Building requirements with existing building standards."

As suggested above, feasibility considerations recognize the youth of green building markets and materials, locational factors, and other building-specific challenges that might be encountered. However, these measures could be characterized as being overly careful; green building codes are (at least currently) premised on the idea that flexibility is needed to foster the types of innovative thinking that will result in higher performing buildings. The green building codes, such as LEED, Build It Green, and Green Globes measure "shades of green" by weighing green attributes, but are ultimately based on a performance-based system of standards that allows builders to achieve higher green levels in ways that are appropriate to the particular project. Green goals are in mind, but how to achieve those goals is flexible. So, under the traditional takings analysis, a claim may conceivably never be ripe, at least until the claimant has exhausted the scheme and available methods of reaching the stated performance goals. In contrast, the Calabasas, California program has no variance process. See Calabasas, Cal., Ordinance 2003-185 (Jan. 7, 2004), available at http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/pdf/green- building-ordinance.pdf. 271 Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v.

To the extent that green building laws tread more heavily, two potential conflicts to monitor, which may require a reorganization of property for our evolving public welfare needs, will be 1) the enforcement of green building codes on existing buildings and 2) the regulations relating to the durability of green buildings and continuing application of green building standards. The more benign (even if unsettled) aspect of the relation between the police power and green building may be the question of whether our growing knowledge about building sickness, GHG emissions, climate change, and habitat loss places green building laws within the scope of the police power authority.274 Clearly, climate change raises issues that fall within the purview of the public health, safety, and welfare,275 even if we have yet to fully understand how grave of a threat that we face or how to 273 Take, more generally, the question of whether there is any incentive to challenge green building laws. At least where green buildings are mandatory, the only competitive advantage among builders in the market will be the experience gained from participating in green projects. A more experienced builder will be able to minimize costs and maximize the benefits of the project. This is likely complemented by the market advantages in the product itself. Green buildings are attracting consumers who otherwise might not be looking for new homes or even considering renovations based on preferences for older homes and homes with older features. Green building is making newer homes (and energy efficient homes) more attractive to potential purchasers. Of course, such an analysis will not account for the interests of all affected parties. For instance, the current focus on green building materials is likely to displace certain products from the market, providing some industries with a strong reason to garner opposition to green building laws. 274 Local governments are generally authorized to adopt ordinances regulating the erection, repair, alteration, reconstruction, and use of buildings within their jurisdiction. Included in this authority is the power to adopt building codes and ordinances as a reasonable means to regulate buildings. See, e.g., LaBay v. Town of Paris, 659 A.2d 263, 266 (Me. 1995); City of Kansas City v. Jordan, 174 S.W.3d 25, 48 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005); Village of Hempstead v. SRA Realty Corp., 617 N.Y.S.2d 794, 795 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994); West Virginia ex rei. State Line Sparkler of WV, Ltd. v. Teach, 418 S.E.2d 585, 591 (W. Va. 1992). Although the police power of the state is not without limitation, it is "very broad and comprehensive, and can be exercised to promote the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of society." Bennett v. Hope, 161 S.W.2d 186, 188 (Ark. 1942) (quoting City of Helena v. Dwyer, 42 S.W. 1071 (Ark. 1897)). However, a likely challenge in states following the so-called "Dillon's Rule," under which local governments are considered mere subdivisions of the state and entirely rely on enabling legislation for their source of authority, is that green building may come under attack in states where enabling legislation has not yet been modified to encompass green building regulation. See generally Williams v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 429 S.E.2d 802, 804 (S.C. 1993) (applying and describing "Dillon's Rule"). 275 For example, in Okeson v.

Rather, as local governments turn to mandatory green building codes, there may be some struggle over the authority needed to enforce them: the authority needed to abate building code violations is generally found in the nature of the violation, such as whether the circumstances of certain buildings present an actual danger to the public health and safety.279 Will the inability of a single inefficient residential structure to meet efficiency 276 The most significant decision in recent litigation is, of course, the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007). The State of Massachusetts was joined by several states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations in challenging EPA's failure to regulate GHG emissions. Id. at 505. One of the hotly contested issues concerned the question of standing to pursue the case. See id. at 516-26. The plaintiffs submitted affidavits and relied on reports asserting a relationship between GHGs and global warming, and that sea level rise was associated with global warming. Id. The Court recognized injuries to the Massachusetts coastline and further rebuked the defendants, finding that the EPA's regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles would constitute an adequate remedy to confer standing. Id. at 526. The Court held: While it may be true that regulating motor-vehicle emissions will not by itself reverse global warming, it by no means follows that we lack jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to slow ox reduce it Because of the enormity of the potential consequences associated with man-made climate change, the fact that the effectiveness of a remedy might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor- vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant. Nor is it dispositive that developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere. Id. at 525-26. The Court found that EPA was statutorily authorized to regulate GHG emissions from new automobiles, and that a determination against regulating carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles must be expressed clearly and supported. Id. at 532, 534; see generally Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7521(a)(1) (2000) (stating that EPA shall regulate the emission of substances which may "cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare"). 277 See, e.g., Donald C.

Although a police power justification for green building laws need not focus efforts on climate change mitigation or GHG emissions reduction, the shared difficulties and justification between the onslaught of climate change litigation and green building laws suggests that close attention should be paid. This raises not the more general question of whether climate change, by itself, causes concern about the propriety of governmental intervention and protection. Rather, the question involves the case that might be made on a project-specific basis against a poorly performing building, measured on green standards. A second interesting claim might concern the competition between the notion of durable building performance - a fundamental component of green building principles280 - and the concept of vested rights. In this instance, local governments implement the high performance principles in green building goals by extending the regulatory compliance timelines in the building permit process to insure that buildings permitted under such a scheme continue to perform as expected.281 Of course, to the regulated entity, this means that the regulatory permitting process does not seem to end. For instance, the City of Pleasanton, California's green building ordinance envisions an extension of the regulatory process in an unusual, but entirely consistent fashion.282 The city's ordinance contains four stages of review for compliance with green building standards: 1) the applicant submits application materials and completes "pre-permitting review" concurrently with the review process for either building design or planned unit design review; 2) the green building official is permitted to review the construction prior to issuance of an occupancy permit; 3) the green building official then re-inspects the premises after one year; and 4) the green building official re-inspects again after five years, to insure that the building remains in compliance.283 280 See Del Perciรฒ, supra note 9, at 129. 281 This is distinguished from ordinances which require builders to post bonds to secure long-term performance, or from incentive-based ordinances, in which local governments reserve the right to reimbursement of grants and loans from construction projects that do not meet green building standards. In both of these types, the regulatory period ends, and the security rests in an extraregulatory mechanism. The District of Columbia adopted an ordinance that combines incentives with insurance, requiring applicants seeking incentives to post a performance bond to ensure that construction projects properly and successfully implement green building elements. See 54 D.C. Reg. 3019 (Apr. 6, 2007). The "Green Building Act of 2006" provides that bonds shall be posted for all privately owned buildings, subject to verification of green performance within two years of occupancy, with additional bonding requirements for commercial projects seeking incentives offered in the green building program. D.C. Code ยงยง 6- 1451.05-.06 (Supp. 2009). The difference between Washington D.C.'s bonding requirement and Pleasanton's continuing regulatory requirement is the absence in Washington D.C.'s ordinance that the two-year period is intended to demonstrate long-term performance of the green building elements of the structure. See id; see also supra note 244 (discussing Pleasanton's regulatory regime). 282 Pleasanton, Cal., Mun. Code ยง 17.50.070 (2006), http://qcode.us/codes/pleasanton (last visited July 19, 2009). 283 Id. ยง 17.50.070(D)(l)-(3).</page><page sequence="52">558 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 During the regulatory period at issue in Pleasanton's scheme, the application process continues after issuance of the building permit and certification of the structure for occupancy. The ordinance states that, at the timeline pressure points, the "applicant shall submit to the green building compliance official documentation detailing conformance with the operation, efficiency, and conservation related credits from the pre-permitting documentation."284 Although the extent of the building official's enforcement authority after five years of occupancy is not entirely clear, the ordinance seems to authorize the imposition of additional mitigation for any finding of unexcused noncompliance with the applicable green building standards.285 Clearly, the ideas behind continuing regulatory schemes implement the sustainability principles of green building, at least to the extent that long- term building performance is central to sustainability and common to all of the various green building schemes. Post-occupancy monitoring serves numerous purposes, including (but not limited to) enhancing our ability to ensure building performance through maintenance, and also by providing an information-gathering mechanism for the consideration of the effectiveness of certain green strategies.286 Moreover, continuing compliance schemes are even consistent with the purposes of conventional building codes in general to the extent that they require property owners (particularly landlords) to keep buildings from falling into disrepair and endangering the health and safety of occupants.287 The challenge, however, is determining whether and when the permitting system ends, and when a permittee can rely on the issuance of a permit in making investments, improvements, leasing the premises, and so on. Specifically, it is arguable that Pleasanton's continuing regulatory approach expands the authority of a local government to enforce green building regulations; in effect, by keeping green buildings within a permitting scheme, the burden continues to lie in the property owner to comply with the regulatory requirements, rather than shifting to the city to enforce the code against an alleged code violation.288 284 Id. ยง 17.50.070(D)(3). 285 Id. ยง 17.50.070(E)(2). 286 See, e.g., Smith, supra note 193. 287 For instance, fire code compliance is typically subject to inspection and regulatory authority to abate violations under the police power for the lifetime of the building. The same applies to electrical, earthquake, and other codes, and even (in some cases) in habitability laws applying to landlords. In each, the condition of a structure is relevant to the public health, safety, and welfare, and where a condition causes a threat, building code enforcement is the mechanism ei'joyed under the police power. See generally City of Edmonton, About Fire Rescue Services, http://www. edmonton. ca/for_residents/emergency_services/about-fire-rescue- services.aspx (last visited July 19, 2009). 288 Of course, conventional building codes envision continuing compliance. The difference is that the issuance of a building permit for conventional codes is usually a final regulatory decision (and, in many states, triggers vested rights). In the typical enforcement scenario, after a final decision has been issued, future enforcement authority does not arise from the permitting process, but arises out of the more general police power to abate building code violations, which has traditionally been subject to scrutiny over the relationship between the violation and the impact on the violation on the public health, safety, and welfare.

Of course, to say that a legal challenge lies on the horizon for green building is not to say that green building schemes are contrary to law. Rather, as is often proposed, "[property law . . . adjusts to new knowledge - for example, about natural capital and ecosystem services - by arriving at new configurations of the relative balance of rights within the property system."289 As Justice Sutherland wrote in Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (. Euclid)m almost a century ago, there is "no inconsistency" in applying background property rules differently in different contexts, "for, while the meaning of constitutional guaranties never varies, the scope of their application must expand or contract to meet the new and different conditions which are constantly coming within the field of their operation."291 Law adapts, as it must, to changing norms and fashions (which adapt, as they must, to changing circumstances and challenges). Whether law must adapt to an explosion in technology (such as the invention of the automobile and the elevator), shifting social norms (such as abolition), emerging markets (for example, the fast food restaurant), or developments in our understanding of natural processes (groundwater), a static, monistic approach to property rights would likely fail to provide a coherent property system. As a result, evolution in property - away from a system of allocation that was never interested in the value of "nature" in natural resources292 - may very well accommodate the aims of resource efficiency, human health, and climate change mitigation, in the same way that property has accommodated nuisance avoidance,293 zoning,294 historic preservation,295 and environmental buildings can be found to have caused a public nuisance.

V. Reflections on Green Building as a New Idea: Putting Humans Back into Nature, and Putting Anthropocentrism to Work Most of our serious environmental problems start right here, at home, and if we are to solve those problems, we need an environmental ethic that will tell us as much about ยฟ/signature as about not using it.297 It is difficult to deny that green building is (and will continue to be) important. The nascency of the movement has not been a hindrance, and the growth of green building has not been contentious.298 Given the inevitability of green building, the task for this section is to consider the conceptual effects of green building: Is the success of green building so significant as to mark a paradigm shift in the way that we understand and interact with nature? The short answer, which will be worthy of discussion for some time to come, seems to be that green building has the potential to launch a new phase in environmental law that promises to reconnect humans with ecosystems. While green building may not be entirely unique by suggesting that we rethink the manner in which we allocate, value, and interact with nature, what is special about green building is its ease in relying on the anthropocentric benefits in its principles, negotiation, and ultimate popularity.299 Due in large part to the characteristically pragmatic development of green building laws, the movement has managed to move forward by avoiding the more difficult questions over whether or to what extent humans and the built environment "interfere" with nature and natural processes.300 Green building reconceptualizes the built environment by 296 See, e.g., Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 303-04 (2002). 297 William Cronon, The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature , in Uncommon Ground: Toward Reinventing Nature 69, 85 (William Cronon ed., 1995). 298 See Del Perciรฒ, supra note 9, at 127. 299 It is telling that this recent trend in encouraging and, in some cases, requiring "green building" has also been labeled "high performance building." See, e.g., Wash. Rev. Code ยง 39.35D.020(2) (2008) (defining "high-performance public buildings" as those built to applicable green standards). Moreover, because green building comes at a time in which duration, efficiency, and overall cost are as significant to the consumer as ever, the economic component of green building can be understood as a primary driver behind green building practices. Beyond the economics of green building as merely a marketing benefit, cost and efficiency are intertwined and inseparable from the impacts that building practices have on natural processes. In the meantime, green building should put to rest the broader question of whether pragmatism has anything to offer law, and environmental law in particular. See, e.g., Joel A. Mintz, Some Thoughts on the Merits of Pragmatism as a Guide to Environmental Protection, 31 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 1, 2 (2004) (questioning whether and how pragmatism can aid in formulating environmental policy). 300 The difficulty in answering this question has largely underlain environmental rhetoric, generally without regard for the inaccessibility of any universally applicable answers.

The picture of nature embedded in green building, then, is arguably distinct from the idea of nature that pervades prior environmental and natural resource laws. Green building is not just inclusive of humans and other ecosystem needs, but also aligns those needs for purposes of identifying value. Of course, the collective environmental consciousness, as illustrated in our array of environmental laws, has come far. The explosions of deep environmental thinking in the latter half of the twentieth century, together with a fear that our past actions will have long-term, irreversible environmental effects, have changed the manner in which we approach the subjects of both development and landscape.301 When combined with the felt occurrences of burning rivers and industry-induced health concerns, the American public discovered a self-preservation incentive to rethink practices that, by themselves, cause significant adverse impacts to the environment.302 In the process, our perspective transformed, slowly but inevitably, toward a recognition of certain needs that derive from the circumstances of nature. In this sense, environmental law has been revolutionary, taking as its first principle the importance of making informed, long-term decisions as an element in our very survival.303 As we began to modify our land use practices, however, we realized that the otherwise impressive array of initial environmental laws had merely scratched the surface of our environmental circumstances, and that something more than a shallow investigation and understanding of natural systems would be necessary to embrace an authentic relationship with our surroundings.304 For instance, as the initial environmental policies matured, ("[I]nstead of issuing vague admonitions to act naturally and not to interfere with nature, environmentalists would do better to examine whether and under what conditions the purposive manipulation of ecosystems and species is wrong. Interference should be left out altogether."); Robert R.M. Verchick, Steinbeck's Holism: Science, Literature, and Environmental Law ; 22 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 3, 6 (2003) ("Given human connectedness with other elements of nature, it is fruitless to speak of what is 'natural' and what is not; we may never plot the boundary between these ideas."). 301 David B. Spence, Paradox Lost: Logic, Morality, and the Foundations of Environmental Law in the 21st Century, 20 Colum. J. Envtl.

See generally World Comm'n on Env't &amp; Dev., Our Common Future 8 (1987). 304 Mark Sagoff describes the initial array of environmental laws as premised on public expectations of four normative issues: compassion for the individual victim of pollution, protection of rights against the intrusion from the ill-effects of pollution, the protection of cultural values, and a sense of community that deliberates over common goals in a manner that incorporates the individual's freedoms.

Of course, state and local governments have adopted an array of laws governing the impacts of "smaller" projects on groundwater recharge, loss of open space, wetlands, forest resources, and habitats, among others.307 The "local environmental laws" were intended to operate at the needed micro scale, in part to fill in the gaps in the federal scheme. The resulting regulatory systems have demonstrated a wide variety of approaches, from top-down planning mandates to individual permitting systems, from local discretion over natural resources and planning visions to interjurisdictional habitat identifications.308 The federal government has meanwhile preserved thousands of acres for wildlife and aesthetic uses, protecting these lands from human consumption and degradation.309 Nevertheless, even these efforts have been understood by many as incomplete.310 In large part, environmental law appeared neither comprehensive nor principled due to an unwavering conception of nature as a collection of capturable "things."311 Hence, many have continued to seek the evolution of a workable and pervasive environmental ethic in law, guided by a hope that the law will expressly incorporate a new, environmentally protective ethic.312 Given the starting point, this project has proven to be a challenge. When we contemplated our identity as a species and as individual humans in the past, we constructed an array of human-centered narratives, including our self- realization of man as conqueror, of human superiority over other living 305 See John R. Nolon, In Praise of Parochialism: The Advent of Local Environmental Law, 26 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 365, 410 (2002) (noting that environmental laws of the 1970s and 1980s addresses serious pollution from point sources, but today's problems include the cumulative effects from the small-scale development of land). 306 See id. at 410-11. 307 See id. at 386-410 (assessing the broad array of local environmental initiatives in this emerging area of law). 308 See id. 309 U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, Land Ownership: Information on the Acreage, Management, and Use of Federal and Other Lands (1996) (tt[T]he number of acres managed ... primarily for conservation increased ... to about 272 million acres [by 1994]."). 310 See, e.g., Edward O. Wilson, The Future of Life 42-43 (2002) (describing the decline in forest and marine ecosystems internationally). 311 See, e.g., Troy L. Payne, Comment, Cartesian Eco-Femdarkanism: She Comes from the Earth, Therefore We Are, 37 Envtl. L. 202, 208 (2007) ("Continued study allowed humans to manipulate natural processes, harness energy, and develop technology. With a perceived cognitive superiority to nature and as the creators of energy-hungry machines, humans mechanized their conceptions of nature."). 312 Although the latter is not intended to be made of straw, it has been recognized that much of contemporary environmental ethics is difficult to translate into a legal program. Id. at 233 (arguing that law should take an intuitionist approach to regulating the environment, but recognizing that a legal doctrine representing that approach would "likely [be] the most complicated piece of legislation ever").</page><page sequence="57">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 563 things based on a capacity to reason, and so on.313 The ontologica! question has since been thrown into a variety of rhetorical constructions - for example, against a legal system that subjugates the functions and performance of ecological processes to the priority of uniquely human needs, or against an allocation of the world to individual human control, or against the degree to which human consumption and population have managed to avoid becoming the subjects of legal scrutiny - and yet, at base, the general tenor of the debate suggests that the law has remained disinterested in the potential moral worth of others in our surroundings. It is arguable, at least, that our current regulatory system adopts, rather than replaces or improves upon, a distinctly anthropocentric (in the pejorative sense of the term) understanding of the environment.314 From this perspective, it is evident that as environmental ethics developed, both in direction and reach, the trends in ethical theory have merely emphasized the divide between environmental law and ethics.315 One way to illustrate this divide is by characterizing environmental ethics as a battle over "nature at the lost and found." The nature that we have lost typically concerns our conception of humans as citizens of a larger community, and the loss is our sense of place in that community: every extinct species, contaminated property, or clear-cut forest emphasizes a relationship that we, as humans, have lost and may be unable to share again.316 In stark contrast, the nature that is found concerns the manner in - which nature is continually reconstructed through our systems of belief, legal and social conventions, and technology, among others; every new structure, applied technology, or even partitioning of a nature preserve creates a new nature and requires us to redesign our understanding of the environment. Of course, both are, in a real sense, effective descriptions of the state of nature. The problem with nature at the lost and found has been 313 See Michael Tobias, Introduction to Deep Ecology, at v, v-viii (Michael Tobias ed., 1985). 314 See generally Richard Delgado, Our Better Natures: A Revisionist View of Joseph Sax's Public Trust Theory of Environmental Protection, and Some Dark Thoughts on the Possibility of Law Reform, 44 Vand. L. Rev. 1209, 1211 (1991) (critiquing Joseph Sax's public trust theory and suggesting normative change toward more eco-centric theories). 315 See, e.g. , Alyson C. Flournoy, In Search of an Environmental Ethic, 28 Colum. J. Envtl. L. 63, 65-66 (2003). 316 This is not to say that either of these approaches is fundamentally wrong or misguided for its own purposes. For instance, the general appeal to our past, typical of a lost nature approach, is exemplified in the pleas from Troy Payne and Janet Neuman: Rivers are drying up. Water tables are falling. Regions that once supported forest ecosystems are barren, and people are abandoning them as inhospitable. Clean water is wasted by some as if it were a right to water a garden with Evian ("naรฏve" spelled backwards). This is not hyperbole - these are stories about forgetting rain. . . . We must move ahead to the past. Troy L. Payne &amp; Janet Neuman, Remembering Rain , 37 Envtl. L. 105, 107 (2007). The lost approach is intuitively comfortable and conceptually powerful, drawing upon our critical, neo- Marxian tendencies to think outside of the box in separate, divergent worlds and circumstances. The dilemma is that such an appeal to lost nature might persuasively be thought to have evolved away or even intentionally overcome (for deficiencies that might not appear in the appeal).</page><page sequence="58">564 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 that, whether nature was described in literature that reminisced the essential sublimity that we have lost, or in literature pointing to the individual sense of self that might be found, the environmental ethics debate raged around an unfortunate common feature; in both conceptions, humans are enticed to act due to a detachment from nature, yet, environmental law is intended to govern human interaction with the natural environment. The debate has been fruitful, in that each side has been compelled to refine and shore up their foundations, particularly with respect to principles that might represent intellectual progress.317 Nevertheless, the debate remains deadlocked because, for the most part, neither has been willing to concede ground on the character and moral significance of "nature."318 In the fray, ethics arguably adopted a superficial role in the formulation of environmental policy.319 What was needed to support environmental law was the emergence of an ethic that governed human use andnonuse of nature as participants, rather than a conception of nature that excluded or displaced humans;320 what was needed was an ethic that recognized the vocabulary of an economic and rights-based ordering of social values, but in a way that did not rely on that hierarchy for its legitimacy. This is where green building is significant. Of course, for those viewing green building from the perspective of the need for nonhuman, nonuse value as a monistic basis for ethics, green building may be conceptually limited. Clearly, green building is unready to support the more significant claim that an ethic of nature must dissolve the role that economics plays in valuing worth and establishing rights and duties.321 Not surprisingly, for instance, the 317 See, e.g., Flournoy, supra note 315, at 83 ("[T]he terminology derived from Environmental Ethics may help orient us, and the theories advanced by philosophers may serve as useful beacons, marking out points on the ethical landscape in relation to which we can locate our position and consider our next steps."). 318 Paul B. Thompson, Pragmatism and Policy: The Case of Water, in Environmental Pragmatism 187, 205 (Andrew Light &amp; Eric Katz eds., 1996) ("Environmental debates over habitat for endangered species are showing signs of a similar pattern, as those who countenance any standing for economic considerations are characterized as greedy and corrupt, while those who advocate for nature are portrayed as uncaring and disrespectful of human needs."). 319 See Flournoy, supra note 315, at 109 (The language of the law and substance of public debate over environmental law both reveal scant attention to its ethical content."). But see Lee M. Talbot, Does Public Policy Reflect Environmental Ethics? If So, How Does it Happen ?f 37 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 269, 279 (2003) ("The one constant in all these environmental policy- making procedures is that ethics are a powerful motivation for the key individual or individuals who initiate and drive the process."). 320 See Holly Doremus, The Rhetoric and Reality of Nature Protection : Toward a New Discourse , 57 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 11, 66 (2000) (M[T]he rhetoric of nature protection must include people in the picture. It cannot simply rely on the wilderness vision of nature necessarily isolated from humanity, unable to bear even the lightest human touch. Putting people in the picture means acknowledging people as part of nature and emphasizing human connections to nature."). In part, the debate itself uncovered such divergent views of ethical duties that law might be said to have failed to incorporate ethics for its failure to adopt one. On the other hand, a credible argument might be made that environmental ethics has developed in a manner that prevents dialogue between ethics and law. 321 As Daniel Fรคrber points out, w[e]conomic growth is not something we are prepared to abandon in the name of environmental protection." Daniel A. Farber, Eco-Pragmatism: Making Sensible Environmental Decisions in an Uncertain World 200 (1999).</page><page sequence="59">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 565 higher cost green building materials and methods are less frequently implemented (although this does not distinguish green building from conventional building methods and codes).322 Nevertheless, in a manner starkly divergent from other laws that have provided an environmental benefit, green buildings can be asserted as a pro-development, pro- economic, and pro-property rights doctrine, while also championing sustainability and conservation. Moreover, even where upfront construction costs have been an influential factor in green building decisions, in many cases, cost has not prevented builders from seeking high green ratings in LEED Silver, Gold, and Platinum certified buildings. By recognizing the availability of green building to moral analysis, it is intended that green building be recognized as theory friendly - but it is also noteworthy that no particular theory can lay an exclusive claim as the basis and justification for green building. Clearly, green building champions the idea that we must integrate a new relationship with nature into the manner in which we build. Charles Kibert issued such a mandate: "The creation of the built environment must ... be consistent with these values by respecting nature and responding to the imperative that we are utterly dependent on the earth's systems for survival."323 The questions that survive the mandate, however, concern whether green building could remain plausible absent a concurrent transformation to "respecting nature" in those occupying green homes, or alternatively, whether green building would remain popular if the economic benefits of green building fell short of expectations. What is apparent is that a decision to build green need not be burdened with an exclusive categorical imperative; it might be nice for all to agree that healthy homes, sustainable practices, and minimal carbon footprints are essential to the survival of the planet and species, perhaps, but only in the same way that it would be preferable to an eco-centrist that all adopt a Gaia perspective of nature, or in the way that a market proponent would prefer that we all adopt an economic approach to assessing values in the environment.324 In other words, perhaps we need not wait for a sea change in the collective consciousness to an acceptance of eco-centric value structures, simply so 322 Few projects strongly pursue energy and atmosphere credits, likely due to the level of focus, or incorporate innovative wastewater technologies, likely due to the cost. Langdon, Cost of Green Revisited, supra note 138, at 15-16. 323 Kibert, supra note 99, at 37. 324 This pluralistic exercise may not, of course, make every advocate feel vindicated. Indeed, sharing the table may make one feel as though there is not enough to go around. Stephen Kellert, for example, expressed his grave concerns about "an overemphasis on material benefits" in approaches to sustainable design. Stephen R. Kellert, Ecological Challenge, Human Values of Nature, and Sustainability in the Built Environment ; in Reshaping the Built Environment: Ecology, Ethics, and Economics, supra note 98, at 39, 48. While recognizing that "[ameliorating the environmental crisis will certainly require more efficient and effective consumption and production systems," Kellert called for more emphasis on the critical "mental and intellectual well-being reflected in the experience of meaning, beauty, companionship, creativity, imagination, inspiration, spiritual wholeness, and more" that can be found in a built environment that is integrated into the natural environment. Id. at 48-49.</page><page sequence="60">566 ENVIRONMENTAL LA W [Vol. 39:507 that we can move forward in pursuing the benefits of green building.325 We can instead recognize that by focusing our dialogue on nature with a causal connection between the built environment and its impacts, and by openly receiving the variety of disciplinary analyses of the strengths (and weaknesses) of green building, green building has invited an authentic, but inclusive dialogue on the need to think seriously about environmental quality in the built environment. Even at this early point in the movement, the developments in green building can help sketch an emerging environmental ethic, as it is clear that green building is premised on several important notions of ethical significance.326 First, green building recognizes that the character of our ecological footprint is, for the most part, within our control, and as such, is intentional.327 This divergence from the prior, economic rationalizations behind legal protection of human intended uses of natural resources (e.g., humans need to eat, therefore we are entitled to spray pesticides to eliminate the potential of insects to damage food supplies; humans have uses for trees, and therefore are entitled to cut them all down; humans have market value in domesticated herds, and therefore are entitled to eradicate predatory species) attributes moral duties to actions that have far-reaching impacts on the environment, even if the object of those duties varies. Second, green building is built upon an increasing body of research about whether and how human actions adversely affect ecosystems and the ecosystem services on which we depend.328 From this knowledge, green 325 The problem is, first, that environmental policies are not made in such monistic ways, and second, that the theory or hope embodied in moral monism may be unattainable. Moral monism considers "one metaphysics of morals: one concept of the nature of morality . . . one concept of human nature . . . one moral psychology." J. Baird Callicut, The Case Against Moral Plรบralism , 12 Envtl. Ethics 99, 123-24 (1990). Assuming there even can be such a close, causal relationship between foundational principles and the identification of actions that are compelled by those principles (a claim that is always under contention), moral monism would of course prevent inconsistent and contradictory actions or programs. Id. 326 This Article merely seeks hints from the movement to identify the foundational and ethical commitments that can be expected (if any). See Flournoy, supra note 315, at 102 (looking for "patterns of values that consistently appear" in environmental laws to find the ethical implications of the regulatory scheme); see also James P. Karp, Aldo Leopold's Land Ethic: Is an Ecological Conscience Evolving in Land Development Law?, 19 Envtl. L. 737, 746 (1989) (seeking an emerging land ethic in law on the assumption that "law is a reflection of social development"). Karp argues that any conclusion that a land ethic is appearing in law must be based on two separate findings: first, that "we have expanded our horizons to include other- than-human economic interests in making decisions about the land"; second, "that decisions regarding the land are being made through a balancing process that involves the weighing of ethical (ecological), aesthetic and economic factors." Id. 327 It is recognized that this claim may invoke an otherwise sticky moral analysis of identifying the mechanism through which intent might be transferred from the intended consequences to the unintended consequences of construction. For purposes here, it is assumed that explorations into the concept of causality in environmental matters is arguably collapsing the distinction, based in large part on both the gravity of the consequences and the amount of knowledge we have gathered about causation in environmental impacts. This contentious point, however, must be left to be developed elsewhere. 328 See, e.g. ;, Office of the Fed. Envtl. Executive, The Federal Commitment to Green Building: Experiences and Expectations 9-14 (2003), available at www.ofee.gov/sb/</page><page sequence="61">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 567 building internalizes the notion that every building causes avoidable adverse impacts - that, for instance, our use of natural resources, such as water, wood, metals, fossil fuels, and others has been done in a way that may contribute to irreversible losses and impair the abilities of nature to regenerate and provide these resources in the future. Additionally, we have come to realize that our construction practices affect our ability to live well in the built environment, as our practices determine the level of indoor air quality. The pull of the environmental identity in green building, it seems, is to draw us away from the notion that nature is "out there," and toward the realization that we are part of what is natural (whether that nature is a "natural order" or a chaotic state of nature makes no difference). Hence, green building represents a reconstruction of nature and our place in it.329 Third, green building reformulates the range of actions that have moral significance. By excluding and exempting small and "minor" actions from the scope of environmental regulations,330 prior environmental laws have essentially excused those actions from culpability for environmentally destructive action; such actions could be undertaken free from moral worth. Not surprisingly, the appearance of development projects as "minor" was considered an economically achievable asset, resulting in "piecemealed" and "segmented" projects and project review at the federal, state, and local level.331 Although green building is new, and in some instances applies only to larger structures,332 the tenor of green building laws is to recognize that every aspect of the built environment, no matter how large or small, contributes in a cumulative manner to a sustainable relationship with the natural environment. A fourth point, which bears an unmistakable relation to the others (in varying degrees), is based on the observation that the inclusion of green principles in green building is not objectionable to the construction industry, and that the economic valuation and support for green building is not fgb_report.pdf (detailing the significant impact on the environment caused by buildings in the United States). 329 It should suffice here to note that the circumstance of scarcity appeals to an anthropocentric analysis by rejoining environmental regulation with the Millian "harm principle," without stating the need to identify and defend more foundational values in and about nature. In contrast, the method of the green building ethic was based on the presupposition that value systems can be grounded in fundamentally anthropocentric aims, and that anthropocentric goods sought in the market can, if correctly understood, compel us to take an active interest in ecosystem integrity. 330 Obvious examples would include exemptions from environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 4321-4370e (2006), and state equivalents, such as the categorical exemptions under the Washington State Environmental Policy Act, Wash.

Although this might seem to be an overstatement, we might consider whether its apparent overbreadth is based on reasons that are relatively trivial. Of course, advocates of the "nature lost" position could decry the green building movement based on the notion that green building innovations merely adopt the technocratic hope that humans are capable of inventing our way out of environmental crisis, or alternatively, that reliance on market forces to guide the pace of the transformation to regulatory controls merely maintains the status quo, business as usual.333 Similarly, advocates of the "nature found" narrative might oppose green building on grounds that the principles of the movement are indistinguishable from its parent - sustainability - and therefore adopt a framework that places nonhuman and nonexistent interests on an equal footing with present needs, which tilts the market away from efficiency in favor of beneficiaries who are not participants in the market.334 Yet, in green building, the two perspectives of nature at the lost and found appear to converge; entry into the markets for green building is intended to re- establish a place for humans in nature and in ecosystems. Similarly, use of innovation in green building relies on our knowledge of natural science and technological developments to serve the human needs for and use of ecosystem services.335 Stated otherwise, the green building approach provides a model /brbuilding, and is not a means of curteilingb'}&amp;รผmg. Such a convergence arguably distinguishes green building from the traditional genealogy of environmental laws, the reach of which has frequently been determined by a relatively arbitrary choice of whether ethics or economics would play the most important role in formulating policy.336 333 See, e.g., James L. Huffman, Protecting the Environment from Orthodox Environmentalem, 15 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y, 349, 361-69 (1991) (identifying and arguing against the notion that markets are necessarily flawed means of natural resource allocation); Christopher Manes, Green Rage: Radical Environmentalem and the Unmaking of Civilization 247-48 (1990) (discussing the notion that environmental protection should be considered a moral imperative, such that no consideration of economic efficiency can enter into the debate on environmental policy). For a different perspective on an orthodox environmentalist's objection to incentive-based regulation, see Hahn &amp; Stavins, supra note 262, at 34 ("Environmental groups will tend to avoid or disfavor policy instruments that make the costs of environmental protection highly visible to consumers."). 334 See, e.g., Hahn &amp; Stavins, supra note 262, at 34 ("Private industry typically is reluctant to endorse any environmental policy mechanism for fear of implicitly endorsing the related environmental goal."). 335 What, then, would be the extent to which green building would retain its popularity if climate change turned out to be a farce? In all likelihood, there would be little effect on green building. The "whole systems approach" embodied in green building, which is not distinct from the ecosystem approach of sustainability, relies less for its credibility on the potential disaster of climate change than on scarcity, fairness, and uncertainty as factors in the ability of our environment to provide for the needs of our species. Accordingly (although it takes a deeper analysis to get there), the same would result if the economic benefits of green building could not be verified. 336 Compare Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. ยงยง 1131(c) (2006) (describing wilderness as a place "untrammeled by man" and prohibiting most economic activities), with National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 432 1^43 70e (2006) (laying out a framework for environmental analysis but allowing economic considerations to trump environmental concerns).</page><page sequence="63">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 569 Green building requires us to recognize, on the one hand, that neither alone provides a sufficient foundation for a workable environmental policy,337 and on the other, that the two can be commensurable, coordinated, and collaborative. Hence, Mark Sagoff has identified the main obstruction to environmental law as one of overcoming the notion that the two must be placed into conflict: In environmental law, as in other forms of social regulation, there are those who interpret legislation as an expression of public values and ethical principles and those who, instead, view legislation as a means to promote economic efficiency by regulating markets. The obstacle that threatens to stall the nation's efforts to combat pollution is the failure to reconcile these two approaches.338 The perspective advocated here - focusing on the pluralism embodied in sustainability - is a pragmatic one. like all pluralistic perspectives, of course, sustainability is notoriously difficult to define.339 Additionally (and for much the same reasons), the normative force of sustainability remains open to debate.340 What, then, does a discussion on sustainability add to the dialogue on environmental ethics, or more importantly, what does sustainability add to the task of bridging the gap between environmental ethics and environmental law? An intuitive response might charge that sustainability does not bear on environmental ethics due to its failure to incorporate a nonhuman moral subject, and may be seen as limited because it "does not expand the community of morally valued entities beyond humans."341 Moreover, because sustainability "is consistent with a calculus of utility like that employed under many laws today," it arguably falls short of an "appeal to any inchoate non-anthropocentric intuitions that members of the public may possess."342 Yet, notwithstanding its inclusion of anthropocentric values, sustainability has attributes "that endow it with the 337 Sagoff, supra note 304, at 23 ("Both the ethical and economic approaches to pollution control law are important, and both have legitimate roles to play in the formation of environmental policy. Although each approach may make a significant contribution, neither by itself suffices as a conceptual basis for regulatory policy."). 338 Id. at 95. 339 Alyson Flournoy provides some insight on the basic principles of sustainability, as follows: Decisions or policies are deemed sustainable only if they incorporate consideration of three co-equal factors: ecology, economics and social equity. Because of the explicit focus on human needs, the concept is compatible with anthropocentrism. On its face, sustainability values the environment and economic activity, not intrinsically but for their utility to humans. The explicit valuing of equity among humans in the allocation of environmental and economic benefits seems to introduce a complementary rights-based approach. Alyson C. Flournoy, Building an Environmental Ethic from the Ground Up , 27 Environs: Envtl. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 53, 72-73 (2003). 340 Charles Kibert notes that "[sjustainability may in fact be a grand illusion. . . .

That is, whatever our ethical commitments may demand, or our ontological insights might inspire, the built environment is at least bound to service within an anthropocentric framework.348 Spector's insight gives us at. least some reprieve in the ongoing challenge to anthropocentrism in environmental ethics and policy, in which it has been apparent that a new approach to our use of natural resources, a new understanding of nature itself, a new identity among others, is needed to prevent further destruction of the ecosystem on which we rely. One of the principal threads of debate seems to be whether the problem lies in anthropocentrism and the "anthropomorphic, anthropocentric man [who] seeks not unity with nature but conquest,"349 or whether the solution more simply requires a refocusing of anthropocentrism and a revised 343 Id. 344 Kelly A. Parker, Pragmatism and Environmental Thought, in Environmental Pragmatism, supra note 318, at 21, 33 ("Denying that one or the other sphere is worthy of consideration may appear to prevent potentially moral conflict from arising, but only at the risk of serious moral blindness. Blind anthropocentrism has deplorable consequences for the non- human world, but a blindly misanthropic ecocentrism is no less deplorable."). 345 Anthony Weston, Before Environmental Ethics ; in Environmental Pragmatism, supra note 318, at 139, 153. 346 Tom Spector, Does the Sustainability Movement Sustain a Sustainable Design Ethic for Architecture ?t 28 Envtl.

Paradoxical because it attacks the very reason for building in the first place - nonsensical because ennobling the human experience seems to already include a respect for the environment." Id. at 282-83. 348 Kelly Parker distinguishes these approaches as follows: "Anthropocentrism maintains that value is of or for human beings. Biocentrism maintains that all forms of life, as such, are valuable. Ecocentrism emphasizes that value of ecological systems as a whole, including natural processes, relationships and non-living parts of the environment." Parker, supra note 344, at 32. 349 Ian L. McHarg, Design With Nature 24 (1969).</page><page sequence="65">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 571 understanding of which policies and actions actually serve human needs. As to the latter, what is clear in green building is that human needs are not only served by immediate use of a particular resource (regardless of whether "use" means conservative use or consumption).350 Green building embodies the idea that, so long as we recognize that our legal system governing buildings should be compatible with human needs, whatever else might be accomplished is up to our willingness to continually refine our understanding of human needs and accept that human needs do correspond to ecosystem needs. Green building provides this understanding by reconstruction and redescription of the ethical values and moral duties at stake. Hence, Bryan Norton argues that "[w]hat we need is more attention on the poverty of currently available languages and models for relating environmental values and goals to the physical dynamics that will determine the ecological character of the world we have to leave to subsequent generations."351 As with any new vocabulary, matters that were previously perceived to be amoral or insignificant may suddenly appear significant.352 The values embedded in the emerging vocabulary of sustainability and ecosystem services require us to ask different questions than those that drew our attention in the past, and likewise compel us to accept an answer of an altogether different quality and character.353 What green building asks is that we recognize that the road toward collective acceptance of new, nonuse 350 what is arguably problematic about the role of environmental ethics in this debate - whether conceived as nature .at the lost and found, or as a core unit of value, etc. - is that the debaters themselves offer few available directions for policy making. Hence, as Norton has repeatedly pointed out, only two options exist for those who do not concede an intrinsic value of nature: "[AJccept and use the specialized language of economics ... or break out of the misleading characterization of the problem as one choosing . . . between the moralisms of the anthropocentrists and the simplistic utilitarian framework of the economists." Bryan Norton, Which Morals Matter? Freeing Moral Reasoning from Ideology, 27 Environs: Envtl. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 81, 92 (2003). That is, we can either adopt an economic perspective, which rejects the value system asserted in bio- and eco-centric moral theories, or we can recognize (or, perhaps, pretend) that we need not definitively identify the "true" character of nature as a precondition to adopting a policy that helps avoid a felt environmental crisis. 351 Id. at 90 ("We need language and interpretive models that are sufficiently nuanced and context- sensitive - to scale and local place- to allow reasonable discussion and deliberation of goals."). 352 See generally Doremus, supra note 320, at 13-14 (discussing how environmental law has been shaped by the rhetoric of environmentalists). 353 In large part, the manner in which we previously valued some subject of emerging interest will seem irrational. For example, Salzman (and others) notes that M[g]iven their significance, one might expect that ecosystem services would be prized by markets and explicitly protected by the law. With few exceptions, however, neither has been the case." James Salzman et al., Protecting Ecosystem Services: Science, Economics, and Law, 20 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 309, 311 (2001). Under a traditional analysis, the nonuse of a resource might have failed to provide any value recognizable as such. The ecosystem services approach, which conceives of values as codependent and complementary, might ask whether the benefits of nonuse (e.g., allowing water to flow downstream, rather than be captured and consumed at some upstream location) outweigh the costs on a broader sphere; if the proposed use would result in water quality problems, water quantity and habitat concerns downstream, and the use value of these downstream ecosystem services is significant, then the value of nonuse may very well be more valuable than the upstream use.</page><page sequence="66">572 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 39:507 values may be served by a multifaceted approach, only one element of which is centered on the merits of the particular proposed use, economic, or nonuse value.354 In the employment of a pluralistic approach, green building illustrates that economic value can adapt to ecological needs; the mere fact that resource efficiency (or put differently, resource nonuse) was not allotted economic value under the traditional property paradigm need not compel the conclusion that it is inherently valueless. That the convergence of nonuse and use values of natural resources can be an effective method in formulating environmental policy is apparent in green building. Green building principles champion a direct improvement on the human quality of life by providing cleaner air and improving the standards of human health inside buildings, by cutting utility costs, and also by focusing on providing more durable economic worth in our homes,355 while transforming our building practices from representing a human victory over nature, toward the representation of humans in nature. To put it another way, green building accomplishes a pluralistic approach to construction by relocating the idea of "property" to a place and relevance within ecosystem needs, and correspondingly advances "green" as the subject of economic advantage,356 recognizing that "positioning 354 This argument has been echoed numerous times among the calls for sustainability in environmental law. For instance, individuals discussed this argument in a well-known collaborative essay: How can we spur this transition and realize the full potential of an ecosystem services approach? Part of the challenge is educational. Most people realize neither the critical role ecosystem services play in their lives nor the threats to service provision. Part is scientific. We need to understand better the linkage between ecosystem function and provision of services so we can appropriately weigh the ecosystem management options. Part is legal, since we have little experience with institutional design and regulatory instruments to protect services. And part is economic. We need to better value services and identify the institutional barriers to their commodification. Id. at 327. 355 See supra notes 31-76 and accompanying text (discussing the multiple LEED certifications for water quality, air quality, and energy use, for example). 356 We do not have to search too deeply to find these stated values. Local government resolutions and ordinances typically address ecological, social, and economic benefits of green building practices, such as in Anaheim's finding that green building, which "can result in significant cost savings" for occupants, will also "provide returns on those investments and deliver economic and environmental benefits" to the broader community. Anaheim, Cal., Res. 2006-187 (Aug. 8, 2006), available at http://www.anaheim.net/utilities/adv_svcjprog/green_ power/GrnConnectResolution.pdf. EPA's Energy Star program provides another excellent example. Implemented in 1992 as a voluntary means to utilize the market in controlling greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy efficiency, Energy Star has grown substantially, including a labeling program benefiting products and buildings that achieve the program's strict energy-efficiency standards. See generally VS. Envtl. Prot. Agency, Energy Star and Other Climate Protection Partnerships: 2007 Annual Report 14 (2008), available at http://www.energystar.gov/ia/news/downloads/annual_report_2007.pdf. Publicity for Energy Star projects and programs is characteristically and notably pluralistic, combining the rhetoric of emissions reductions with the financial advantages of efficient building systems. For example, see EPA's marketing for the "Change the World, Start with Energy Star" campaign, proclaiming that "[i]n 2007 alone, Americans, with the help of Energy Star, saved more than $16 billion on their utility bills while reducing greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from 27</page><page sequence="67">2009] AT HOME WITH NATURE 573 environmental issues that reflect tangible value to building owners, and ideally at low cost, will dictate their overall character and emphasis."357 This is not to say that the green movement has already accomplished the task of transforming our relational identity in nature.368 Without too much fanfare, it could be agreed that most major transformations iri thinking appear quite slow, piecemeal, and incremental to those seeking change.359 Green building remains young and largely untested, at least against the traditional challenges leveled against land use control regulations.360 Yet, when Davis Langdon's report identifies the challenge - "we continue to see project teams conceiving of sustainable design as a separate feature"361 - the tone of the apology is evidence of the evolution at hand. Two decades ago, the ideas of sustainable design were in fact separate, external features to the building process which did not fit well into then-prevailing conventional building codes.362 Today, it is notable to find builders who have not caught up with green building, and the reasoning behind their complacency is considered defective.363 Green building is quickly becoming the norm, and the objectives that it embraces are becoming the foundational principles in the practice of building construction.364 As reported by Jones Lang LaSalle, "Sustainability is not a passing fad - it is rapidly being mandated as a business imperative."365 million vehicles."

In this sense, green building illustrates a development in the environmental movement in using the language of economics to provide an effective platform for change. 358 Of course, many of the legal issues in green building laws remain untested, such as liability concerns of builders, whether green building standards will ultimately become the standard for judging construction defects, and so on. These are important questions, of course - the popularity of green building is so promising that we might legitimately expect that green standards will rise to the level of industry standards for purposes of construction defect liability. Simply put, as green building becomes more pervasive and common, the benefits of green building may become part of the expectation in home buyers. 359 Charles P.

Conclusion: The Contribution of Green Building to Environmental Law Amid global warming concerns, the increasing cost of fossil fuels, and the decreasing cost of green building materials, the momentum behind the "green building" movement continues to grow.366 Because of its youth, it might be premature to assess the sustainability of green building as a concept, method, or movement. Although the informational successes of early green building programs are impressive, we are early in the process of exploring what green building concepts are capable of achieving.367 Much work is yet to be done, and green building is likely to progress, adapt, and evolve.368 Still, we can recognize that the history of green building laws represents an enormous success in discovery. The principal strategies of green building laws have included voluntary standards and market-based incentives, encouraging green building in public and private construction, in education, and through leading by example. The principal payoff of the informational strategy has been an explosion of interest. Among other things, rather than litigating the authority to force people to live in healthy homes, initial green building efforts allowed for collaboration on a vision of a qualitatively different built environment while we explored much of the needed information about why we build green. What we are discovering is that green building is not just "green"; green building is about property value and property development, and it is about conservation of our precious natural resources, and it is about healthy homes and the health of this generation and the next. Green building advances human interests, including, but not limited to, economic interests. In an important sense, green building may not be expected to be the ultimate solution to our environmental problems, in that we will likely not wake up to find that our green homes and offices have resolved civilization's more significant adverse impacts on nature.369 We should be realistic about our hopes for a revolutionary reduction in environmental impacts from each building, one building at a time. On the other hand, the green building movement has been enormously significant, due at least to 366 Abair, supra note 180, at 623. 367 Hence, in the important area of indoor air quality, usable data is still lacking in large part. See Del Perciรฒ, supra note 9, at 152-53. Del Perciรฒ suggests that the preservation and reporting of such data should be awardable in LEED credit systems, id 1, and to some extent, that idea has taken form in the LEED rating systems. See, e.g., LEED NC, supra note 29, at 74 (awarding points for verification of thermal comfort, although expressly not intended as a continuous monitoring requirement). 368 See Bronin, supra note 207, at 242 (identifying various criticisms and recommendations for improvement in LEED). 369 It has been suggested that, as green building becomes more pervasive and data on green building efficiency becomes more available, the positive impacts will exceed these more moderate expectations.
