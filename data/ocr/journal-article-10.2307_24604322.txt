LONG1 The following is a description of funerary objects found in 1966 in the Municipio of San Marcos, Jalisco and photographed in August of the same year. Their general provenience and the circumstances of their discovery were established with the aid of several reliable informants. The excava tions were not controlled. Therefore, no information exists as to the loca tion of the artifacts within the tombs. Also no artifact analysis has been made. Nevertheless, the information of tomb and cemetery location is ac curate. The objects are important because they are part of the West Mexican shaft-tomb furniture so well known as pre-Columbian art but so little known archaeologically. Literally thousands of these funerary artifacts have been looted from West Mexican tombs, but only a handful can be assigned to a specific provenience. These and similar artifacts are found in tombs from a geographic area extending from Colima, through western Michoacân and Jalisco to Nayarit. Many regional and temporal styles are reflected in the variety of figures (solid and hollow) and vessels found. However, only a few of the many styles known have been described adequately. The little information available suggests that the shaft-tomb furniture was produced over a time span that extended from about 500 B.C. to 700 A.D., and that the entire complex, throughout the known area of its occurrence, reflects an elaborate form of ancestral worship. Nevertheless, this will remain only a speculation until much more archaeological data can be gathered. 1. Alors que cette note était déjà sous presse, la triste nouvelle du décès de M. Stan ley V. Long, sur le Rio Vaupés (Colombie), où il poursuivait de nouvelles recherches, nous est parvenue ; que le lecteur veuille considérer cet article comme un hommage posthume.</page><page sequence="3">522 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES It is hoped that these descriptive data will be of use for future distribu tional studies of this little studied but important shaft-tomb complex. The Municipio of San Marcos is located about 90 kms. west of Guadalajara and 35 kms. southeast of the archaeological site of Ixtlân del Rio, Navarit. It is part of the volcanic Lake Basin of Magdalena which has an elevation of 1400 m. above sea level. Until the early 1900's, the basin contained several fresh water lakes. The largest of these, the Laguna de Magdalena, was drained and the sources blocked by earth dams to provide agricultural land and water for irriga tion. Parts of the two smaller lakes, the Lagunas de Santa Maria and Colo rada, remain. Archaeological sites have been found around the margins of these lakes and on two former islands in the Laguna de Magdalena. These sites are of two types, habitation and burial. The habitation sites are found near the modern pueblos located on the lower slopes bordering the basin. The ceme teries are located also on the margins of the basin but at an elevation higher than that of the habitation sites. The cemeteries generally contain one or several artificial mounds with shaft-tombs and pit burials located under and around them. The shaft-tombs are usually spaced apart in rows. West Mexican shaft-tombs have the following general form : a vertical pit, from 2 to 16 meters deep, with a lateral chamber or chambers exten ding from the base of the shaft. They were excavated in a soft tuffa deposit found throughout the basin, but occasionally were excavated in an over lying clay-loam deposit. The tombs excavated in clay-loam often collapse destroying any record of tomb architecture. This apparently occurred with the tombs discovered near San Marcos. The tombs contain one or several extended supine burials and a variety of tomb furniture ranging from pieces of hollow clay figures, spindle-whorls and a few bowls to several dozen elaborate hollow figures, polychrome ves sels, metates, obsidian mirrors, conch shell trumpets, jade and shell orna ments. The range of tomb architecture — deeper and more complex tombs correlate with more elaborate furnishings — and burial furniture reflect considerable social stratification. Some hollow figures and funerary vessels are found in caches without burials, also occasional burials are found without grave furniture. These are found in shallow pits and may represent a different time period. II The artifacts from San Marcos fall into two groups with respect to both site location and style. The first group is composed of one clay vessel, one hollow anthropomorphic figure and one hollow two-headed dog. These arti facts were found in a site located on the outskirts of the pueblo of San Mar</page><page sequence="4">FUNERARY OBJECTS FROM SAN MARCOS, JALISCO, MEXICO 523 cos, about 300 meters north of the road that goes from San Marcos to La Puerta del Coche, Jalisco. Here in a pasture next to the ruins of an old adobe house is a low mound that contained four separate burials. Human bones were encountered at a depth of about a meter in four tombs that extended in a row across the western side of the mound. One of the earth tombs con tained the funerary objects mentioned above, and another, without tomb furniture, was covered with stone slabs. Artifacts Fig. 1. — Seated anthropomorphic figure. (different colors are indicated by solid black, plain white and stippling ; on a bichrome artifact the darker color is indicated by black or stippling ; on a trichrome artifact black is indicated by black, the intermediate color, usually red, by stippling, and the lighter original surface, buff to orange, by plain white ; broken surface indicated by heavy stippling.) Color : Brown with red painted lower torso and red paint on each side of the face ; horizontal black negative (resist technique) stripes extend across the front and back of the upper torso. Dimensions : Height, 22 cm. ; width, 13 cm. Remarks : Surface of figure is covered with a small to me dium deposit (spotted appearance) of manganese oxide. Fig. 2. — Two-headed dog. Color : Slipped red ; limbs and part of the body painted fugitive white ; white paint was covered with resist black, leaving a pattern of white dots. Dimensions : Height, 13 cm. ; length, 22 cm. Remarks : Vent hole placed in top of only one of the two heads ; surface of figure covered with a heavy deposit of manganese oxide. Brown vessel. No photograph or description of the vessel is available. These artifacts relate stylistically more with artifacts from the State of Nayarit than with those from Jalisco. However, at a relatively early date (ca. 300 to 0 B.C.), similar figures frequently appear also in Jalisco (Long 1966 : 97-101). The second group of artifacts was found in another cemetery located about two kms. north of the pueblo of San Marcos and one half a kilometer east of an arroyo called La Canada. The site is composed of two mounds. The southernmost mound contained an earth tomb of about two meters depth. The burial chamber contained several individuals and some 18 artifacts. These were found mixed with earth and stone slabs. Apparently the roof of the chamber, being of clay</page><page sequence="5">524 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES loam, had collapsed filling the chamber with earth and mixing the contents. The stone slabs probably had been placed in the chamber entrance to pre vent the chamber from filling with earth when the entrance shaft was refilled at the time of the interments. This is a relatively common feature of the tombs in this region. Fig. 3. — Small solid, seated female (hollow head).

This last group of figurines with the exception of the one illustrated in fig. 12, belong to the type Ameca Gray which was first defined by Isabel Kelly and further defined by the author. The type is characterized by the following traits (Kelly 1948 : 58-61 ; Long 1966 : 64-66) : Form is rounded Treatment is in moderate detail Symetry is bilateral Front (head and upper torso) is emphasized Head is large, out of proportion with body Face is long and straight Shoulders project upward Arms are stubby, separate from body Elbows are not indicated Breasts on female figures are large and pendulous Genitalia generally not indicated. Surface is gray to light brown, unslipped Parts of body may be painted red Occasional negative (resist technique) designs on face and upper torso Fine textured gray paste, some figures have fine brown colored sandy paste Figures are generally well fired Surface of figures may be covered with a light to medium deposit of manganese oxide. Funerary vessels are often found in association with the Ameca Gray figures. These are thin-walled, well fired, bichrome or polychrome bowls with a fine gray colored paste. One variant, that found in San Marcos, has a fine sandy paste with a light brown color. The paste in both the figures and the bowls is the same, and both are well fired. Therefore, it is probable</page><page sequence="8">FUNERARY OBJECTS FROM SAN MARCOS, JALISCO, MEXICO 527 that both were made by the same people. This is supported to some extent by the known geographic distribution of these ceramics which are found in an area extending from Compostela, Nayarit to La Cofradia, Jalisco (Lum holtz 1902 : 293 ; Kelly 1948 : 59). The figures and possibly also the vessels have been tentatively placed within a time period of A.D. 0 to 300 accor ding to trait seriation with two other figure types for which we have radio carbon dates (Long 1966 : 93-96).
