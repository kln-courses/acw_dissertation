<plain_text><page sequence="1">285 minorities. Gypsy-travellers are those members of the population who resist proletarianization and are thus perceived as economic anomalies. Mayall quickly dismisses the issue of Romany culture in fa- vor of a dialectic between settled and unsettled communities. But his method is compromised by his ahistorical citation of sources. He ranges over the whole of the nineteenth century to make his points about the nomadic community, coupling early and late nineteenth-century comments together to make a point, though it is perfectly clear from his own sources that attitudes toward the "gypsies" changed in many respects over the century. One difficulty with this book is its assumption that itinerant life on the English roads was roughly uniform. Mayall wants to produce a social docu- ment that soberly separates romantic concepts of gypsies from other travelling types, but in the proc- ess, the gypsy-travellers are blurred in their general way of life as much as in the hyphenation of the term used to describe them. Mayall explains that early in the nineteenth century these itinerants served a useful purpose in rural areas, mending pans and supplying various minor needs. Most of these itinerants stayed fairly close to urban centers and many migrated regularly to follow agricultural pat- terns (hop-picking, for example) or the numerous local fairs. In discussing the itinerant way of life, Mayall minimizes the differences among those who followed it. Other scholars in this field, such as Ju- dith Okely, have also dismissed the idea of a "true" Romany people and described a more mundane way of itinerant life, but Okely was constructing a pic- ture of the modern English itinerant community. Despite Mayall's assertions, there is still some evi- dence to suggest that things were different in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Though Mayall has consulted the tendentious investigations of the Gypsy lorists, which he dis- trusts, and local and national legal documents, which he accepts almost by default, he should also have considered the large number of intelligent writers who knew a great deal about the gypsies. There is no mention here of Richard Burton, Tom Taylor, and Theodore Watts-Dunton. Perhaps these writers were misguided, but some considera- tion of their evidence might have been helpful. Mayall has made up his mind that there can be no contamination of the gypsy-traveller image by any foolish notion of a Romany race. But many students of the gypsies, including the prominent French scholar Jean-Pierre Liegeois, who receives no men- tion in Mayall's study, acknowledge that, although the notion of a "true" gypsy is a pipe dream, there is nonetheless an identifiable community of Roms who are different from mere tinkers, hawkers, and tramps. With all of its careful research, Mayall's book begs a major question because it begins by blurring distinctions among the itinerants of the English roads, and, for a good part of its examination, mini- mizes historical changes in the perceptions of the people known as "gypsies." His evidence against a caste of Romanies is negligible, though the evidence identifying them with mere travellers is abundant. However, as Mayall himself admits in his effort to dis- tinguish the types, "It seems that for every claim there is a counter-claim" (p. 111). In the end, what we have is a well-informed but dry and repetitive study of people who travelled the roads of nineteenth- century England, their occupations and the treat- ment they received from "respectable" society. But it lacks an imaginative grasp of how varied that community of nomads could be and ignores its own evidence that most of the testimony about these people was so biased or misinformed that it can rarely be trusted. As a study of the conflict between nomadic people in a sedentary community, this is a solid contribution, but it leaves much to be said about how, in the face of constant denigration, some of these gypsy-travellers captured the imagina- tion not only of Gypsy lorists, but of novelists and playwrights and their audiences as well.

Science and Literature in the Nineteenth Century, by J. A. V. Chapple; pp. xii + 192. London: Mac- millan, 1986, £20.00, $29.95. THESE VOLUMES ILLUSTRATE TWO FRUITFUL DIREC- tions that the current interest in the relations of sci- ence and literature can take. Ludmilla Jordanova's collection, The Languages of Nature, presents close textual analyses devoted to thematic issues loosely united by their interest in the "languages" used to ex- plain different aspects of "nature" in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. J. A. V. Chapple's Science and Literature in the Nineteenth Century presents pas- sages from early and late nineteenth-century scien- tific and literary texts, arranged thematically and linked by commentary, in four chapters devoted to the physical, life, and anthropological sciences. Jordanova's "new historicist" introduction em- phasizes boundaries and dichotomies: "two in particu- WINTER 1989</page><page sequence="2">286 lar will crop up time and time again in the present volume: mind/body and living/non-living" (p. 34). The introduction also refers to important "bridging concepts" like "sensibility," "habit," and "organiza- tion" which made for "productive ambiguity" in contemporary discussions of science and literature. The collection contains four essays devoted to eighteenth- and three devoted to nineteenth-century science/literature relations. All eight should prove useful to Victorianists. A. E. Pilkington's "'Nature' as Ethical Norm in the Enlightenment," for instance, sheds light upon the ambiguous way that nature was used alterately to confirm or to refute ethical argu- ments. The essay might provide a helpful background for understanding similar uses of "nature" by Victori- ans. Jordanova's essay on "Naturalizing the Family: Literature and the Bio-Medical Sciences in the Late Eighteenth Century" explores the relation between literature and various eighteenth-century treatments of sexuality, reproduction, and family. "Sensibility, Sympathy, Benevolence and Moral Philosophy in Tristram Shandy," by James Rodgers, considers one of those important "bridging concepts" that scientific, philosophical, and literary works shared. The essay's emphasis on sympathy should also make the essay in- teresting reading for Victorian scholars tracing the re- lation between Victorian psychology - such as that of Alexander Bain - and literary treatments of sym- pathetic understanding. Victorianists will also find Maureen McNeil's study of "The Scientific Muse: The Poetry of Erasmus Darwin" interesting both for the writer studied and for what is said about his transi- tional role between eighteenth- and nineteenth- century conceptions of science. The least interesting of the three essays on nine- teenth-century literature and science is Roger Huss's description of conservative tendencies in Jules Michelet's natural history writing. Gillian Beer's "Anthropomorphic Elements in the Language of The Origin of Species" is, on the other hand, a subtle interplay of literary-critical and philosophical think- ing. Among the essay's more controversial highpoints is its suggesting of ways in which Darwin creates as he describes the process of evolution. "Because of his highly charged imaginative language and the need to invent fresh terms and to forge new metaphorical connections, he appears to perform an individual cre- ative act. His text has progenitive power" (p. 243). Sally Shuttleworth's "Fairy Tale or Science? Physio- logical Psychology in Silas Maner" provides an inter- esting reading of George Eliot's novel in light of George Henry Lewes's psychological essays. It is heartening to see scholars tur their serious attention to Lewes. Peter Alan Dale's contribution to George Levine's anthology, One Culture: Essays on Science and Literature (1987), is another example. A general caution about the scholarly depth of some essays in this collection. The work (Shuttle- worth's, for example) is sometimes less textual anal- ysis than theoretical inference calling for a skeptical attitude from the reader. Looking a bit further, one also notes that the scientific convention of paren- thetical cross references often serves a rhetorical rather than a scholarly purpose. In discussing Dar- win's analogies of kinship, for instance, Beer in- cludes the following citation (p. 238): "(Hesse, 1966; Black, 1962)." Now Mary Hesse's Models and Analogies in Science does not refer to Darwin at all, and Max Black's work on metaphor is only distantly pertinent to the relation of literature and science. Citation of the two books in this way seems intended as much to suggest comprehensive background as to substantiate Beer's argument. The editor's or the pub- lisher's decision to make the volume look like a scien- tific monograph (where such parenthetical citations are common) does this text in the human sciences minor damage at the very least. Chapple's book would make a highly useful sup- plementary text in an advanced undergraduate or graduate "studies" course in the nineteenth century. The introduction is a rich survey of the impact of science in the nineteenth century, though one clogged at times by too many names and parenthe- sized references. But the introduction also calls at- tention to the work of such little-known "exposi- tors" of science as Mary Somerville. Everywhere apparent is the contribution that over a decade of research on Victorian periodicals has made to the richness and specificity of our knowledge of the Vic- torian era. For the student beginning a study of Victo- rian science and literature, the chronological table and four different bibliographies provide useful ini- tial guidance. The chapter on astronomy, physics, chemistry, and meteorology begins by discussing Coleridge's reputation among scientists and his friendship with Humphry Davy. It then discusses and cites brief pas- sages from the work of such writers as P. B. Shelley, E. Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Dickens, and H. G. Wells. The chapter on paleontology, geology, zool- ogy, and biology includes passages from the usual authors: Robert Chambers, Charles Lyell, Charles Darwin, and Alfred Tennyson. It also includes some welcome, and occasionally unusual ones, such as T. L. Peacock, Oscar Wilde ("The Decay of Lying"), and Charles Kingsley. Taking the chapter on psychology, anatomy, and physiology as representative, it might be well to VICTORIAN STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">287 issue a general, though minor caveat about the breadth of the volume as a whole. First, the chapter title is inaccurate since neither anatomy nor physi- ology gets much attention. The chapter is also a dis- appointment in light of recent research in the area. To its credit, it lays out the territory fairly accu- rately with its subtitles: Mind and Matter, Strange Powers of Mind, The Body and its Brain, Uncon- scious Cerebration, and Evolutionary Psychology. But the citations emphasize only two important fig- ures: Lewes and W. B. Carpenter. On the other hand, there is a wealth of reference to decidedly lesser lights: Peacock and DeQuincey from early in the century; Frances Power Cobbe from after mid- century. Herbert Spencer is only mentioned, while Eliot is quoted - too frequently but at least relevantly. Totally overlooked, however, are the significant contributions of T. H. Huxley (espe- cially the 1874 essay on animals as "automatons" that began over a decade of periodical discussion of automatism and dual consciousness). James Sully is mentioned, but none of his considerable essays for the journal Mind are referred to, whereas Lewes's contributions are. The chapter on anthropology, ethnology, phi- lology, and mythology includes citations from F. Max Miiller, E. B. Tylor, and Andrew Lang, as well as passages from George Meredith, Joseph Conrad, and Wells. Once again, however, other notables are absent. Huxley is not mentioned, nor is J. H. Lubbock or Walter Bagehot. Violet Paget (who with Walter Pater and Lang resuscitated a number of ancient myths in the pages of Macmillan's Maga- zine, Fraser's, the Corhil Magazine, and elsewhere) is not mentioned, though she was probably as well- respected as Lang. Conrad is cited, but one might ask why W. B. Yeats's psychological/alchemical fan- tasies are not mentioned. The concluding chapter, "Science and Litera- ture," tries to specify the relation between scientific and literary effort, affirming that "as long as nine- teenth-century scientists remained in a shared dis- course and culture, they used similar means to sway their readers ..., struggled with like problems of literary expression and wrote with an imaginative sense of fact, an ability to create potential truth, long thought typical of men and women of letters" (p. 160). To dramatize this similarity Chapple might have quoted at length instead of merely allud- ing to James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 essay, "Mole- cules." Set next to Maxwell's text, a passage or two from John Tyndall's 1870 British Association for the Advancement of Science essay, "The Scientific Uses of the Imagination," would have then com- pleted the book's argument, invoking another prominent Victorian scientist not seen enough in this otherwise useful study. ED BLOCK, JR. Marquette University A Musical Peacemaker: The Life and Work of Sir Edward German, by Brian Rees; pp. ix + 328. Bourne End, Bucks.: The Kensal Press, 1986, £14.95. AT THE TIME OF HER GOLDEN JUBILEE IN 1887, Queen Victoria was photographed in her regalia as Empress of India, a signal to her loyal subjects at home and abroad that their erstwhile paragon of do- mestic virtue had matured into a veritable Mother- Empress. For the remainder of her reign the mood of the nation was optimistic and celebratory. The older she grew, the more Victoria was compared with her formidable predecessor, Elizabeth Tudor. It would be hard to imagine two queens less alike in character or intelligence, yet it pleased the late Vic- torians to associate their empress with one who had established England's sea power (the sine qua non of empire) and presided over the most glorious phase of the English Renaissance. They perceived that the triumphs of Oriana would add lustre to their own grand pageant of Victorian achievement. Those who had given their all to the pageant faced a period of readjustment when it came to an end in 1901. One who found the change unbearable was Edward German, the subject of A Musical Peacemaker, by Brian Rees. Recognised at the end of the century as England's most accomplished com- poser of theatrical music, German failed to move with the times and found himself stranded, bereft of motivation and inspiration, by 1910. He had a fur- ther twenty-six years of life to come to terms with his fate, but never did. Born in 1862 at Whitchurch in Shropshire in the twenty-fifth year of Victoria's reign, German rose to fame amidst the heady patriotism of the post- jubilee years. He learned the essentials of his craft at the Royal Academy of Music in London where he spent the years 1880-87 under exacting but conser- vative tutors like Ebenezer Prout. After leaving the Academy loaded with prizes, he gravitated to the London theatres where famous, if aging, actor- managers were busy reviving Shakespeare. Young German's efficiency as a musical director and his re- sourcefulness as a composer of mock-Tudor inciden- tal music won favourable notices in the national press.
