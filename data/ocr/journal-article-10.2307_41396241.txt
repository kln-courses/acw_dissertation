<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Metaphysical Mirth of Emily Dickinson By Paul W. Anderson "Mirth is the Mail of Anguish-" THAT evident Emily from Dickinson the remarks did, by indeed, her niece, possess Martha a comic Dickinson spirit is evident from the remarks by her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, in Emily Dickinson Face to Face-. "Nothing could be more fatal to knowing Aunt Emily on her own terms than to take her literally when her mood was hyperbolic. Her friend Samuel Bowles rated this quality in her above all others, and called her 'his rascal'. . . . It is the element of drollery in her, the elfin, mischievous strain, that is hardest for those who never knew her to reconcile with her solemn side." This bone is offered to the biographiacs, who have worried (or rejoiced) over Dickinson's reclusive solemnity or who have seen only quaintness or eccentricity in the way of a comic spirit. So much for person. What is the significance of her comic spirit in terms of poetry? In his essay on "Emily Dickinson and Sir Thomas Browne," Herbert Childs touches an aspect of that significance: "Like many great humorists, they (Browne and Dickinson) took a sidelong view of life. ... In Browne the word is 'asquint' . . . Emily Dickinson used the word 'oblique' . . . The words epitomize their common habit of looking at human affairs indirectly in order to see therein life's ironic pathos and humorous incongruity." George F. Whicher, in his essay on "American Humor," notes the same essential obliqueness: "To grasp the soul at white heat she needed more than ever the tongs that wit supplied. Complete integrity in what lay too deep for tears was possible only by indirection." Tone, as Archibald MacLeish points out ("The Private World"), becomes a highly complex and determina- tive thing in her poetry. Thought and feeling, seriousness and humor become inseparable: "like our own beloved Robert Frost who has looked long and deeply into the darkness of the world as a man well can, 'their eyes, their ancient glittering eyes' must be gay." T. S. Eliot, too, is aware of this yoking together of disparate sensibilities in one vision. In his essay on Andrew Marvell, working toward a [ 72 ]</page><page sequence="2">EMILY DICKINSON 73 definition of metaphysical poetry, Eliot observes that the wit in "To His Coy Mistress" is "not only combined with, but fused into, the imagination . . . this alliance of levity and seriousness (by which the seriousness is intensified) is a characteristic of the sort of wit we are trying to identify." Tone in metaphysical poetry is often a curious blend of comedy and tragedy, as in many of Donne's songs and sonnets; it is a certain slant of sensibility. Dickinson herself wrote a poem embodying the basic credo for her comic obliquity, number 1129 (poems referred to follow T. H. Johnson's numbering): Tell all the truth but tell it slant- Success in Circuit lies Too bright for our infirm Delight The Truth's superb surprise As Lightning to the Children eased With explanation kind The Truth must dazzle gradually Or every man be blind- The awe of truth can often only be contained within the wide circle of mirth. As William Howard points out in passing, in his essay on "Emily Dickinson's Poetic Vocabulary," this aspect of her work has been generally overlooked or denied. It is this aspect which shall be explored in this paper. The great range of Emily Dickinson's comic spirit, from barely discernible whimsy to obvious satire, renders any neat categorization of her uses of comedy impossible. But an exploration of several facets of her comic spirit, its effect in the poetry, should reveal the decidedly metaphysical nature of her employment of mirth. Obvious in both its satiric humor and in its metaphysical meshing of the beatific and bestial is the famous "Papa above!" Satire by reductio ad absurdum evokes a sinister smile: Papa above! Regard a Mouse O'erpowered by the Cat! Reserve within thy kingdom A "Mansion" for the Rat! Snug in seraphic Cupboards To nibble all the day, While unsuspecting Cycles Wheel solemnly away!</page><page sequence="3">74 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Particularly in the last stanza is there what Whicher calls "that wilfull confounding of scale," that uniting of disparate elements, as Eliot says ("The Metaphysical Poets") which characterizes the tone of metaphysical poetry. The protest in the poem, against orthodoxy's conception of a personal God and a hedonistic heaven, thus is made incisive rather than vindictive. The humor of the juxtaposition places the perspective on the object itself, not on the outraged poet. On the surface a much simpler poem "The morns are meeker" actually contains much subtler implications of the tonic effects of the comic vision: The morns are meeker than they were- The nuts are getting brown- The berry's cheek is plumper- The Rose is out of town. The Maple wears a gayer scarf- The field a scarlet gown- Lest I should be old fashioned I'll put a trinket on. The inevitable and calculated slight shock of the slant rhyme "gown/ on" coheres with the tragicomic theme. In the first place, the per- sonification in the poem, characteristic of the majority of Dickinson's nature poems, is a tongue-in-cheek, a comic personification, antipodal to what Ruskin had in mind when he wrote of the "pathetic fallacy." That "the Rose is out of town," that death and decay constitute half the rhythm of life could frequently drive Dickinson to such prosaic, if impassioned statement as For each ecstatic instant We must an anguish pay In keen and quivering ratio To the ecstasy (125) but here, in "The morns," under the control of the comic vision, the poem embodies an essential truth of the human condition, focuses objectively on it, rather than simply megaphoning the agonized message of the writer. Rather than sentimental, the tough reasonableness of the poem resides in the paradox of the last two lines: man's attempts to merge with nature are futile and funny, and yet the "fashion" of fall, of the seasons and what they mean, must be accepted. It could</page><page sequence="4">EMILY DICKINSON 75 almost be taken as a parody of "Corinna's Going A-Maying." It is certainly as complex in tone. This tonic complexity by way of a metaphysical kind of mirth permeates much of Dickinson's most serious poetry. The few critics who have recognized this have not investigated its specific effects on poetic technique, particularly use of imagery, and have considered only the psychological function (another form of biographical fallacy) rather than the esthetic. Donald F. Connors, for example ("The Sig- nificance of Emily Dickinson"), states that "there are many instances in her poems where her feelings are lodged behind a mask of mirth until the anguish is scarcely perceptible," but he goes no further into the poetics involved. Note, for example, what Dickinson's comic vision does to the "Lotos-Eaters" or death wish theme in number 133, "The Grass so little has to do": The Grass so litde has to do- And even when it dies- to pass In Odors so divine- Like Lowly spices, lain to sleep- Or spikenards, perishing- And then, in Sovereign Barns to dwell- And dream the days away, The Grass so little has to do I wish I were a Hay- This is not a distressing "effort at lightness," not "countrified eccen- tricity," as Yvor Winters would have it ("Emily Dickinson and the Limits of Judgment"). It is sophisticated poetry: subtle, complex, care- fully worded. One may be taken in by the quaint sentiment of the initial "The grass so little has to do," may be lulled into the succulent lethargy of divine odors and lowly spices, but one can only be hoist by his own hay-fork if he fails to detect the deflationary incongruity of "Sovereign Barns!" The poem does deal, and deal seriously, with the malady that Tennyson dramatizes in "Lotos-Eaters," the ennui of existence, of consciousness. But Dickinson does more than dramatize (chiefly in the last line): she also judges the attitude. Through the comic personification of the grass ("stir all day to pretty Tunes," "thread the Dews all night," "hold the Sunshine in its lap") in, typically, incongruously courtly terms, the poem at once warns the</page><page sequence="5">7 6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW reader and sets him up (like the reader traps in Tale of a Tub) for a heaven of "Sovereign Barns": a curious blend of satire and sentiment, scorn and remorse, for the comforting old orthodox ideas of heaven and for existence itself. Thus, the last line, "I wish I were a Hay," much more than a wistful or whimsical wish, is, through the tonic complexity of what has gone before, a judgment, a ridiculing of that wish. By personifying death as a kind of courtly gentleman, Dickinson invades an area of the ineffable shunned by Donne, who also dwelt much on death in his poetry. Donne, however, as in his dealings with the afterlife, nearly always limits himself to attitudes towards death. Even in "Death be not proud" Donne is addressing an abstraction rather than a personification. Dickinson confronts death directly, dra- matically, often comically: I made my soul familiar- with her extremity- That at the last, it should not be a novel Agony- But she, and Death, acquainted- Meet tranquilly, as friends- Salute, and pass, without a Hint- And thus, the Matter ends- This, the conclusion to number 412, exemplifies the way in which Dickinson mines material from the ineffable with a mirth that twists with wry humor the old sex/death relationship of Donne's time. Her soul and Death "meet tranquilly, as friends" rather than as the lovers that really are, or were. They "salute, and pass (the soul on its way to heaven?), without a Hint" because their "affair" is over: "And thus, the Matter ends." The pun on "Matter" is obvious. Humor has de- termined mood, metaphor, tone, but the determinism, the restrictions inherent in the comic vision render her free to use such material as death and the afterlife. Fear, horror, pain, belief are objectified. In the same way she confronts the terrible incomprehensibility of the eternity of the silent dead with a certain slant of language inevitably comic in its distortion: Under the Light, yet under, Under the Grass and the Dirt, Under the Beetle's Cellar Under the Clover's Root,</page><page sequence="6">EMILY DICKINSON 77 Further than Arm could stretch Were it Giant long Further than Guess can gallop Further than Riddle ride- Oh for a Disc to the Distance Between Ourselves and the Dead! This is the same sort of comic, cosmic hyperbole that one finds in Donne's love poetry ("The Sunne Rising," "The Relique," for example)- deliberate distortion that fuses pain and poignancy with self- mockery. In the following poem (345) emotion is again so muted by mirth that the attitude of the poet seems earned, though no logic, no rational construct is involved: Funny- to be a Century- And see the People- going by- I- should die of the Oddity- But then- I'm not so staid- as He- He keeps His Secrets safely- very- Were He to tell- extremely sorry This Bashful Globe of Ours would be- So dainty of Publicity- Despite the usual "I" in the first stanza, the casually conversationalist lines are too lean for tears: the terrible implacability of time is only intensified by the comic, bemused detachment with which it is ob- served. Similarly, the image of the dainty bashfulness of this globe at once holds off and evokes the horrors of history with the shield of humor. As MacLeish says, it is characteristic of her unforgettable tone that "it does not clamor at us even when its words are the words of passion or agony." Charles Anderson's comment (Emily Dickinson's Poetry), that "the anthropomorphic conception of deity seemed inadequate, hilariously so to her," is only partially or occasionally true. Her conception of a careless God could also drive her close to despair, and could result in a poem in which the comic and tragic visions are juxtaposed rather than fused:</page><page sequence="7">78 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Of Course- I prayed- And did God Care? He cared as much as on the Air A Bird- had stamped her foot- And cried "Give Me"- My Reason- Life- I had not had- but for Yourself- 'Twere better Charity To leave me in the Atom's Tomb- Merry, and nought, and gay, and numb- Than this smart Misery. The first five lines serve as a comic prelude, a pout from the mouth of a childlike persona. They work a kind of comic cajolery, by humor- ous reduction, to lead the reader into an idea or mood of despair other- wise unapproachable in its shock, its vastness, its heresy. There is a sense of a Miltonic "vast abrupt" between God and the chaotic "smart Misery" of human existence. And yet the comic metaphor of the bird somehow provides deliverance from complete despair by the extreme unction of understatement. More often, Dickinson's comic spirit finds its way into a poem in subtler fashion. As Whicher so aptly puts it, her "instinct for comedy ... is woven into the fabric of her poems and cannot easily be separated for analysis. It startles us in an unexpected phrase or epithet and is gone before we know it, as though a bird in flight had slightly lowered an eyelid at us." There is something of the winking bird in the Gothic machinery of "One need not be a Chamber- to be Haunted." Haunted houses, corridors, midnight meetings, a collapsing Abbey- all prepare for the final two stanzas, where the silly and the serious emerge in a complex tone and meaning: Ourself behind ourself, concealed- Should startle most- Assassin hid in our Apartment Be Horror's least. The Body- borrows a Revolver- He bolts the Door- O'erlooking a superior spectre- Or More- The question, Is it possible, at last, to look around and see your Self? is couched in cartoon language. But the terror of the trap of self-</page><page sequence="8">EMILY DICKINSON 79 consciousness is felt, dramatized, objectified. Robert Frost's "Desert Places," which treats the same theme, seems flat statement by com- parison. A similar reduction of the Gothic to the absurd is seen in number 861: Split the Lark- and you'll find the Music- Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled- Scantily dealt to the Summer Morning Saved for your Ear when Lutes be old. Loose the flood- you shall find it patent- Gush after gush, reserved for you- Scarlet Experiment! Sceptic Thomas! Now, do you doubt that your Bird was true? Certainly the metaphor of man as lark-splitter is metaphysical in its incongruity. The poem is a serious comment, in comic terms, on the nature of man. Man is the sinister source-seeker, the destroyer of nature and beauty because he cannot simply accept beauty, the way things are. One of the best of Dickinson's nature poems, "A Narrow Fellow in the Grass," is really another comment on the most elusive aspects of human existence. The tone is typical: polite, wry diffidence, evoca- tive of a very slight, self -mocking smile. Ostensibly a precise rendering of a snake's appearance, the poem is actually a profound perception of the reality of time past, of myth, of the Jungian "collective uncon- scious." The poem is too well known to be quoted in full. Note, however, the careful preparation for the intensity of tone of the last stanza. In the first stanza, the basal tone is set by immediately calling the snake (never referred to as "snake") "a narrow Fellow," a comic personification the elegant variation of which enforces the theme. (You do not call a snake a snake because, trailing clouds of myth, the snake is loathsome.) Also, "his notice sudden is." This underplayed element of surprise, of shock and mystery is carefully built up to prepare for the dramatic, earned emotion in the conclusion. In the second stanza the snake is only glimpsed fleetingly, a "spotted shaft" that opens and closes the grass blades. In the fourth stanza, the startling description of the snake as "a Whip lash/Unbraiding in the Sun" ends with the snake's sudden disappearance: "It wrinkled, and was gone." The warm sociability and familiarity of the fifth stanza, which contrasts the</page><page sequence="9">8o THE GEORGIA REVIEW "cordiality" of "several of Nature's People," only intensifies the shock and mystery climaxed in the final stanza: But never met this Fellow Attended, or alone Without a tighter breathing And Zero at the Bone- It evokes a nervous smile, uncertain and self-conscious. A strange truth has been touched here in this half-comic metaphor that gathers together all the threads of the ancient serpent/Satan myth into a fabric of restrained and reality-rooted fear. The conceit of the snake as a "Fellow" is more than quaint. The idea of Satanic embodiment is at least vaguely "there" even in the first Une and is reinforced in this last stanza. Further, the reinforcement of the suggestion is accom- plished by the reference to Edenic innocence in stanza three, "Yet when a Boy, and Barefoot," and by the "Whip lash" image, suggestive of the scourge of Satan, the punishment of the Fall. Unlike the fantastic "ancient knowledge" Gothicized in Robert Bridge's "Low Barometer," or some of the highly rhetorical "racial memory" passages in Faulkner, Dickinson's poem presents the perception with precision and convincing reality. The assumed decorum of her comic vision here again achieves vital detachment. Detachment is inevitably a hard-earned artistic process. Allen Tafte believes ( The Man of Letters in the Modern World) that Dickinson and Donne share the control of detachment: "Their sense of the natural world is not blunted by a too-rigid system of ideas; yet the ideas, the abstractions, their education or their intellectual heritage, are not so weak as to let their purely personal quality, get out of control." That these external aids to artistic control are important is obvious. I should simply like to suggest that in a great many poems Emily Dickinson's primary source of control is her deliberately imposed comic vision. In number 1035, for example, what seems all along to be a homey, personal immersion in nature is undercut suddenly by the revelation of a startling and comic persona: Bee! I'm expecting you! Was saying Yesterday To Somebody you Imow That you were due-</page><page sequence="10">EMILY DICKINSON 8l The Frogs got Home last Week- Are settled, and at work- Birds, mostly back The Clover warm and thick- You'll get my Letter by The seventeenth; Reply Or better, be with me- Yours, Fly. Pure fun, in a kind of comic dramatic monologue, subdues the frenetic, tense anticipation of spring. The mirth, of frogs and flies as harbingers of spring, is metaphysical in its logical reality, its incon- gruity. A punch line also punctures a nature-inspired mood of gloom in number 1075: The Sky is low- the Clouds are mean. A Travelling Flake of Snow Across a Barn or through a Rut Debates if it will go- A Narrow Wind complains all day How some one treated him Nature, like Us is sometimes caught Without her Diadem. In other words, caught with her crown down. The mercurial quality of her mirth can sometimes take the shape of a comic tableau, as in number 1177, where Dickinson paints a starchy allegorical portrait: A prompt- executive Bird is the Jay- Bold as a Bailiffs Hymn- Brittle and Brief in quality- Warrant in every line- Sitting a Bough like a Brigadier Confident and straight- Much is the mien of him in March As a Magistrate- The stiff-necked portrait effect is accomplished by using an unusual, for Dickinson, number of adjectives: prompt, executive, bold, brittle, brief, confident, straight. It is a comic comment on the law of nature and the nature of law.</page><page sequence="11">82 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Finally, it should be re-emphasized that Dickinson had the curious ability to avoid sacrificing cosmic implications at the expense of the comic. This will be apparent if two poems of similar circumstance are kept in mind while reading number 1343 below: Gray's "Ode on a Favorite Git Drowned in a Dish of Gold Fishes" and Freneau's "On a Honey Bee": A single Clover Plank Was all that saved a Bee A Bee I personally knew From sinking in the sky- 'Twixt Firmament above And Firmament below The Billows of Circumference Were sweeping him away- This harrowing event Transpiring in the Grass Did not so much as wring from him A wandering "Alas"- The poem can be read as allegory, with bee as man affording obvious comment on the precariousness of human existence, an existence which is swept up in the "Billows of Circumference," the mysterious totality, as Johnson suggests, of "all relationships of man, nature, and spirit." But the poem is richer, more real, more convincing if allegory is not imposed. The poem speaks for itself. The bee exists, and what happens to the bee's existence is important because "I personally knew" that bee. Not only is no man an island, but nothing in existence is an island. If this seems an extravagant extraction, note the extravagant scope of imagery, from bees and clover to firmament and circumference. As in most great poetry, especially metaphysical poetry, the question of how to handle the disparate worlds of the concrete and the abstract is asked. What happens to the bee is somehow indicative of the nature of reality. The first three stanzas present the event with comic ob- jectivity. This is what happens: an irresponsible "Gover Plank" fails to save a bee from an irresponsible "Freight of Wind," and "Bumble Bee was not." Perfect objectivity. The bee is not brutalized, not murd- ered, not plotted against. He simply "was not." But with the last stanza the smile becomes very uncertain. What is the nature of reality? How</page><page sequence="12">EMILY DICKINSON 83 is one to exist? Is one to live with a beelike, stoic acceptance of con- sciousless, amoral nature? The first Une introduces a value judgment, or so it seems, initiating a curious and complex chain reaction: i ) this is silly, the event is hardly "harrowing"; 2) in the sense of an exemplum of the blind brutishness, the nature of nature, it is, indeed, harrowing; 3) the bee is admirably stoic; 4) the bee is stupidly stolid; 5) which is more real, clover or circumference? No answer is given; as Dickinson says in number 1400 ("What mystery pervades a well"), "nature is a stranger yet." The poem is a comic dislocation of language, syntax, imagery into a new meaning, or a new quest for meaning. Humor is often at the heart of Emily Dickinson's vision, in many of her best poems; she exploited the human capacity for risibility, which enabled her to unite her feeling for both "a nearness to tremen- dousness," as one poem phrases it, and for wonder at the familiar. She, too, with Sir Thomas Browne, saw man as "that great and true Amphibium, whose nature is disposed to live not only like other creatures in divers elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds." The pain and poignancy of that division she muted and transmuted by a comic spirit that provided sufficient artistic detachment, unity and complexity of tone, a wide range of materia poetica, and startling variety in shades of emotion and thought. Of course her metaphysical mirth is not always at work; nor would she or we want it to be. As she said, in what is probably one of her last poems, "The earth has many keys." Her comic spirit is one.</page></plain_text>
