<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Intimate Egoism": Reading and Evaluating Noncanonical Poetry by Women KATHLEEN HICKOK APPROACHING RELATIVELY UNKNOWN AND UNREGARDED WOMEN poets, which of the different criteria that contend for space and credibility in literary criticism and pedagogy can we most fruitfully employ? What methods shall we use for evaluating and explicating the works of women poets who have not been included in the tradi- tional Victorian canon?1 I want to propose an eclectic and responsive approach that allows the potential pleasures of the reader to material- ize before the operations of the critic overwhelm them. Of course, no reading is ever innocent and unmediated by the reader's experience, but I want to privilege the unfamiliar text itself, at least initially, rather than the critical responses to it, and I want to defer hypotheses and generalizations until the text has been allowed to breathe.2 To illustrate, I have chosen poems by Eliza Cook, Augusta Webster, Emily Pfeiffer, and Louisa Bevington. The poems are first- person lyrics about relationships, about love and loss, about nature, God, and humanity. In thematics, imagery, verse form, and philoso- phy, these poems are representative of both the individual poets and the large body of poetry written by women during this time period.3 I consider all four poems worthy of serious and respectful attention. I want to register and retain the uniqueness of each poem, even when, as in the works I have reproduced here, many similar poems can be collected and shown to constitute a genre or tradition in which a theme is consistently treated with similar imagery, form, and rhetoric. In the case of the poems below, the relevant traditions could be described as mother-daughter elegies and attempts to reconcile new scientific theories with religious faith. I suggest we begin by adopting Nancy K. Miller's "poetics of the underread" and attempt to encounter each new text "as if it had never been read, as if for the first time."4 One practical reason to do so is that, for many readers, this undoubtedly will be their first read- ing of obscure poems. More importantly, we allow writers who 13</page><page sequence="2">i4 / VICTORIAN POETRY disappeared from the canon, for reasons we might reject today, to ob- tain a new, fair chance at an audience and a re-evaluation. Who knows but we may discover poems we like that we would not other- wise have noticed? I Miss Thee, My Mother5 Eliza Cook (1818-1889) I miss thee, my Mother! Thy image is still The deepest impressed on my heart, And the tablet so faithful in death must be chill Ere a line of that image depart. Thou wert torn from my side when I treasured thee most - When my reason could measure thy worth; When I knew but too well that the idol I'd lost Could be never replaced upon earth. (1840) This lyric is one of several poems Eliza Cook wrote about the death of her mother. As the last of eleven children, Cook was very close to her mother, who encouraged her in reading imaginative lit- erature and writing poetry.6 Mrs. Cook died sometime before Cook was 20 years old.7 I could not ascertain the cause of her death, but frequent pregnancies and confinements made married women's repro- ductive years exhausting at best and dangerous at worst in the nine- teenth century.8 As a grieving daughter, Eliza Cook expressed the feelings of many others when she declared "I miss thee, my mother!" Cook was praised in the nineteenth century as a poet who "sang for the people and was comprehended of the people," a poet whose themes "touch home, and have often caused the eyes to dim with tears."9 The poem is an apostrophe to the departed mother; apostrophe is traditionally "associated with deep emotional expression" with "the speaker addressing some glorious leader of the past and invoking his or her aid in the present."10 Cook's poem is a domestication of this trope. This initial stanza is followed by four others expressing grief and a final stanza of religious consolation. In that last stanza, the speaker says that her affections and thoughts have followed the mother's spirit to God. Thus the prayerful associations of "thee," "thy," and "thou" are appropriate, and the typical nineteenth-century sanctification of motherhood is affirmed. The last two lines of the opening stanza foreshadow this resolution. The angel mother has be- come the domestic and moral counterpart of the glorious leader of the past. The speaker's "faithful" heart is compared to a gravestone, with the mother's "image" impressed upon it. This image is both the re- membered countenance of the mother and an idealized representation of her. The mother has made such a deep impression upon the</page><page sequence="3">KATHLEEN H1CKOK / 15 daughter that her influence will be sustained until the daughter's own death. The tablet engraved with the image must itself perish before the impression of the mother will begin, line by line, to fade. The word "line" connects the line engravings of Victorian illustration with the poetic "lines" that Cook has written about her mother, as well as with the elaborately carved grave markers of the Victorian era.11 The rhymed endings of line 1 and line 3 reiterate the order of loss - first the mother is "still," and then the daughter "chill." With the loss of her mother, the speaker acknowledges her own mortality - yet another reason to turn from worldly joys to faith in God. The metaphor of the heart is complicated by the suggestion that it was torn from the speaker's side when the mother died. This "sa- cred heart" image and the pierced side of the speaker constitute a Christian allusion to the passion of Christ, which would be inappro- priate here, except that the daughter realizes by the end of the poem that she has been worshiping "graven images" and must reform. If the mother stands falsely in the place of God, then does not the suffering, abandoned daughter appear in the place of Christ? Whether we inter- pret this positioning as blasphemy, the sin of pride, or perhaps, since Cook was a feminist, the self-destructive sin of martyrdom, it is the spiritual error for which the daughter needs moral guidance, and she receives it by the poem's end. The metaphor of value ("treasure" and "worth") suggests a paral- lel with the poetic, artistic production - will its worth be measured properly? Cook asserts reason as a criterion of full valuation. Cer- tainly the worth of the mother is emotional, spiritual, and rational - and, by implication, the worth of the poem as well. "I Miss Thee, My Mother" is at once an emotional outpouring of grief, a spiritual apo- theosis of the mother, and a complex and carefully reasoned discourse upon love, loss, faith, and immortality. Mother and Daughter Sonnet XV12 Augusta Webster (i837'i894) That some day Death who has us all for jest Shall hide me in the dark and voiceless mould, And him whose living hand has mine in hold, Where loving comes not nor the looks that rest, Shall make us nought where we are known the best, Forgotten things that leave their track untold As in the August night the sky's dropped gold - This seems no strangeness, but Death's natural hest. But looking on the dawn that is her face To know she too is Death's seems misbelief; She should not find decay, but, as the sun Moves mightier from the veil that hides his place, Keep ceaseless radiance. Life is Death begun: But Death and her! That's strangeness passing grief. (1895)</page><page sequence="4">1 6 / VICTORIAN POETRY Like Eliza Cook's poems on the death of her mother, this sonnet by Augusta Webster locates the mother-daughter bond in the shadow of death. We know that no one escapes mortality, but the death of ei- ther one in the mother-daughter pair is especially difficult for the sur- vivor to reconcile. To lose one's mother, as Cook did, is at least in the generational scheme of life; to lose, or even contemplate losing, one's daughter is more unassimilable. And whereas Cook came from a large family, Webster had only one child, the daughter to whom the poems in this unfinished sonnet sequence were addressed. In sonnets XXIV and XXV, Webster expresses her satisfaction with having only one child; however, it makes that lone daughter all the more precious. For anyone who wanted to be a mother in the nineteenth cen- tury, stopping at one child was risky, given that infant mortality rates in the middle classes ran at about 25 percent between 1850 and 1880.13 Most families in the 1860s had five or six children,14 although at the end of that decade, at about the time Webster gave birth to her daughter, a trend toward smaller families had begun among the En- glish middle classes.15 Numerous poems by women depicting the death of a child and the grief of the mother were written and published in the nineteenth century, with the role of comforting bereaved parents and helping them express their grief. Sonnet XV is unusual in that the child has not met an untimely death, but lives; for this reason, perhaps, the poem is not overtly consolatory in tone. The octave of this Italian sonnet presents the speaker's accep- tance of the fact of death, for herself and her husband. The convo- luted syntax of the eight-line sentence emphasizes the difficulty of achieving this acceptance, despite the assertion in line 8, "This seems no strangeness, but Death's natural hest." Hest is itself a strange word, a curtailed form of behest, meaning "an order, command, or earnest request."16 The speaker's earnest request, implied rather than stated, is somehow to exempt her daughter from this fate. The imag- ery of the octave emphasizes the physical corruption and the losses that Death entails. Death hides us, makes us voiceless, nought, for- gotten, untold - a fate doubly poignant, perhaps, to a writer. Death is a jester, and life may be a cruel and meaningless joke. The sestet, with its unusual rhyme scheme of cdeced, transposes the natural order at the end, just as the speaker wishes to do for the daughter. The syntax is straightforward. The six lines contain four in- dependent clauses, in three declarative sentences. If the mother's death is sunset ("the sky's dropped gold"), the daughter's birth was dawn, and she should keep ceaseless radiance, not molder in the dark.</page><page sequence="5">KATHLEEN H1CKOK I 17 While reconciliation to death is possible in the abstract ("Life is Death begun")* the sense of strangeness, the estrangement, in the death of a child is more powerful than grief. The mid-stanza simile suggests eternal brightness behind the veil of Death, the proverbial sun emerging from behind the clouds; this is God and the heavenly realm. Truly, "to know she too is Death's" is a knowledge too strange to sustain. It is a misbelief; for though the mother may not believe herself worthy eternity, surely the much loved daughter is worthy. If there's eternal radiance for any, then the despairing acceptance ex- pressed in the octave is a "misbelief." In Cook's poem, the daughter retains the mother's image until her own death, but Webster's speaker expects the parents to be "for- gotten things that leave their track untold." In an inversion of Cook's poems, the poet mother here preserves for posterity the image of the beloved daughter. In a curious way, Death is thus cheated of the daughter, whose radiance survives if the poetry survives. Further, if eternal life can be claimed for the daughter, then why not for the par- ents as well? Recognition of the daughter's immortal spirit leads the mother to faith, to a position "passing grief." The fears of the octave are allayed in the sestet. A philosophical tone is achieved, the speaker's goal is attained, and the poem is resolved. The religious theme is less overt in Webster than in Cook, and Webster's verse form is more sophisticated, but the two poems are comparable explo- rations of Victorian doubt and faith in the specifically feminine, and ultimately reassuring, context of mother-daughter love. The Chrysalis17 Emily Pfeiffer (1827-1890) When gathering shells cast upwards by the waves Of Progress, they who note its ebb and flow, Its flux and re-flux, surely come to know That the sea-level rises; that dark caves Of ignorance are flooded, and foul graves Of sin are cleansed; albeit the work is slow; Till, seeing great from less for ever grow, Law comes to mean for them the Love that saves! And leaning down the ages, my dull ear Catching their slow-ascending harmonies, I am uplift of them, and borne more near, I feel within my flesh - laid pupa-wise - A soul of worship, tho' of vision dim, Which links me with the wing-folded cherubim. (1876) With "The Chrysalis" we leave the mother-daughter context and the explicit focus on death, but the theme of doubt and faith persists. Emily Pfeiffer was a reformer who wrote novels, plays, and social es- says as well as poetry. She wanted to extend education and suffrage</page><page sequence="6">1 8 / VICTORIAN POETRY regardless of race, class, or gender. She supported trade unionism, and she wrote forcefully against the cultural victimization of single women, fallen women, working-class women, and foreign women. Throughout Poems (1876), from which "The Chrysalis" is taken, reli- gious faith supports the hope for an egalitarian future. Pfeiffer was conscious of being a woman artist and wrote often about the con- straints on female aspiration and achievement in the nineteenth cen- tury. Another sonnet, "The Winged Soul," presents the controlling metaphor for this volume; in that poem she portrays the pain and frustration of the creative human spirit trapped and degraded by arbi- trary social distinctions. Pfeiffer's faith is that social progress and evo- lutionary change are divinely inspired, and that amelioration of the human condition, though slow, is therefore certain. That is the theme of "The Chrysalis" - resignation to the gradual nature of change, strengthened by recent theories and discoveries in evolutionary geol- ogy.18 The attempted reconciliation of science and religion is, of course, an important Victorian problem, explored by Tennyson, Arnold, Clough, Ruskin, and others. The sea metaphor in the octave of "The Chrysalis" emphasizes the natural ebb and flow of change; the seashells suggest the spiral structure of progress. The shells are cast "upwards" because progress moves toward the divine. (This matches the speaker's sense of uplift in the sestet.) The subject of the octave is not I, the speaker, but they who search for the signs of positive change and note the advances and setbacks of progress. At the literal level, the subject is also they who embrace the new scientific theories. The poem takes a religious turn as they must come to know, and know surely, that ignorance will in- evitably be flooded with truth, and, in a baptismal image, that sin will inevitably (and consequently) be cleansed. "The work" of reform like the work of evolution is slow, but these observers, the poet asserts, cannot help perceiving its upward tendency, so that the law of nature comes to signify for them the love of God ("the Love that saves!"). The first-person speaker enters the poem in the sestet to comment on her personal role. The age's "slow-ascending" movement is harmo- nious, and she can dimly perceive the harmony, can see the vision. Like the shells on the tide, she is uplifted, and carried nearer the cul- mination of change. The metamorphosis image of the title becomes explicit in the last three lines of the poem, where the speaker sees herself likewise in flux, developing, changing, being (re-)borne into the winged soul that worships God and maintains faith in progress. She is linked to the cherubim, the winged angels that support the throne of God and act as guardian spirits to men.</page><page sequence="7">KATHLEEN HICKOK / 19 Thus Pfeiffer claims for herself a sanctified role as poet-prophet: her mission is to reconcile and to inspire. This is a substantial claim for a woman writer to make, but it is clearly in line with Pfeiffer's re- formist philosophy and with the elevated Victorian idea of the poet's social duty. Perhaps to keep from appearing too bold, the speaker's in- sights in the sestet are all tentative. She must lean down the ages, her ear is dull, her vision is dim, the cherubim's wings are folded, and her very self is undeveloped. The word "pupa" - literally, the larva in its last stage of metamorphosis - derives from Latin for girl or doll, and is related to "pupil"; in addition to denoting a student, in British Civil Law pupil denotes "a minor under the care of a guardian" (Webster's p. 1153). Thus Pfeiffer's role as guardian spirit is complicated by her simultaneous position under a guardianship herself, which as a mar- ried woman, of course she was. And although this pupa is "wise" (and the octave is a reasoned analogy), the speaker's authority in the sestet for the truth of her vision is emotional and spiritual (and therefore culturally - and acceptably - feminine): "I feel within my flesh ... a soul of worship." Egoism a deux19 Louisa Bevington (i845-?i895) When the great universe hung nebulous Betwixt the unprevented and the need, Was it foreseen that you and I should be? - Was it decreed? While time leaned onward through eternities, Unrippled by a breath and undistraught, Lay there at leisure Will that we should breathe? - Waited a Thought? When the warm swirl of chaos-elements Fashioned the chance that woke to sentient strife, Did there a Longing seek, and hasten on Our mutual life? That flux of many accidents but now That brought you near and linked your hand in mine, - That fused our souls in love's most final faith, - Was it divine? (1882) Louisa Bevington's poetry was even more engaged with evolution- ary science than Emily Pfeiffer's. In the same year that Pfeiffer pub- lished "The Chrysalis," Bevington published an entire volume, Key Notes, under the pseudonym "Arbor Leigh."20 The verses in Key Notes were understood to be philosophically based in evolutionary theory. Charles Darwin, who had not read a volume of poetry in fifteen years, expressed satisfaction with Key Notes; Victorian reviewers found the book to be more scientific than literary. In 1881 Bevington published an article in the Fortnightly Review defending evolutionary science.</page><page sequence="8">2o / VICTORIAN POETRY The subject continued in the 1882 volume from which "Egoism a deux" is taken; however, this subsequent volume found more favor than Key Notes in literary circles.21 It is not difficult to see why: the metrical experimentation, the romantic theme, the poetic diction all justify a literary explication. Bevington has been variously described as an anarchist and an atheist.22 The religious affirmation of the three previous poems by Cook, Webster, and Pfeiffer is not to be found in "Egoism a deux." In- stead, the poem questions the probability of Providence and, I think, dismisses it. The title translates as "Egoism for two," "Egoism of two," or "Intimate egoism" (Webster's, p. 16). The first two lines of each stanza present scientific descriptions of creation, geologic time, and the evolution of species. The second two lines of each stanza raise the possibility that the natural forces at work were commanded by a Will, a Thought, a Longing - in short, by some kind of deity who foresaw the intimate two of the title and guided cosmic events so as to ar- range and endorse their love. The poem does not explicitly answer the six versions of this question whose most direct statement is the last, "Was it divine?" But the context of the questions and the title of the poem make an affirmative answer problematic. Like the great uni- verse itself, the answer hangs "nebulous betwixt the unprevented and the need." Regardless of the answer, the lovers have not been pre- vented from meeting: they have "fused [their] souls in love's most final faith." The "need" of the lovers for a spiritual endorsement, for a faith and love that transcend death, is itself a form of egoism. They will have to content themselves with their own intimacy and faithful- ness to each other. That the great forces of the universe have con- spired on our behalf is likewise a flattering and romantic notion; in light of scientific discoveries of the later nineteenth century, it was a difficult idea to defend. Not only is the love, the "you and I," prob- ably accidental; the very presence of life on the planet, of human breath, may be accidental as well. The philosophy of the poem is ag- nostic at best. What of its literariness? This poem seems more modern than the others in its diction and form as well as its resolution. Words like "nebulous," "chaos-elements," and "accidents" coming from scientific theory give the poem a slightly prosaic tone and remove it from the more flowery poetic diction of midcentury. The contrast between the grand scale of each stanza's opening and the self-interested question at its end creates an ironic humor - perhaps Death has us all for jest after all. The original forces are in some sense void (unprevented, unrippled, undistraught) - disinterested, unemotional, nonhuman.</page><page sequence="9">KATHLEEN HICKOK / 21 The subsequent hypothetical attributions of Will, Thought, and Longing look like anthropomorphic fabrications; as such, they are slightly ridiculous. The abruptness of each final line underscores this satiric effect. Yet the speaker does not evidently despair. The final stanza, while acknowledging the role of flux and accidents, still values the nearness, the linking, the fusion of the lovers. In this affirmation, it belongs to the literary genre of amatory poetry, of which it is a creditable example. I opened this explication of poems with a request for critical and evaluative forbearance. Let me now be explicit about my recommend dations. First of all, I think critics and readers, including feminist critics like myself, should resist the temptation to find the text we seek: for instance to look for and therefore find (only) one more ex- ample of female subjectivity; inescapable consciousness of gender; au- thorial repression, anxiety, and eruption; doubleness; simultaneous entrapment in and exclusion from culture; oppositional discourse; re- visionist moments; and so on.23 I do not mean to disparage the valid- ity, usefulness, and integrity of these various formulations, only to re- mind that such observations should follow from the literary texts in question, not precede them - -logically, temporally, and in order of importance. That is, the poem is the most important artifact: to be most accurate and helpful, the criticism should be drawn inductively from the poem, and we should likewise read the poem first and con- sider the criticism later. I have attempted to model this process with the structure of my essay and to apply to the poetry the eclectic hermeneutics that I advocate. I concur with Isobel Armstrong in perceiving a danger in feminist criticism, that "a concentration on moments of overt protest can ex- tract the content of a direct polemic about women's condition in a way which retrieves the protest, but not the poem" (Armstrong, p. 319). Authors of numerous feminist critical books and articles do seem to value and to choose particular texts for analysis at least partly because of those texts' expression of gender difference and explicit or implicit critique of Europatriarchal culture.24 Some feminist readers seek out literature that appears to counter patriarchy with a "female system" of some kind;25 that is, the literary text can be read as em- bracing or embodying a set of feminine linguistic and cultural values. Here we touch upon an area of ongoing debate; for other feminists de- value and avoid such a text for exactly the same reasons. According to Margaret Reynolds, "a strand of radical thinking values certain kinds of women's poetry which it politicizes as naturally, and essen- tially female, failing to recognize that the criteria which it uses have</page><page sequence="10">22 / VICTORIAN POETRY been inherited from that apparently old-fashioned and redundant derogation of women's poetry. A dangerous feminist folk-poetics is thus created."26 Certainly there is a body of literature that is currently taken to constitute a specific, self-conscious women's literary tradi- tion, characterized by specific themes and images such as metamor- phosis, monstrosity, imprisonment and escape, and specific subject matter such as romantic love, domesticity, and sexuality.27 Victorian women writers (including poets) figure prominently within it.28 If the tradition that has been and continues to be so painstakingly exca- vated and described is real (or even if it was perceived for a time to be so), then literature which fills in the interstices and reveals the connections is valuable to literary history. Finally, feminist critics have repeatedly articulated nonaesthetic goals, such as female solidar- ity and cultural transformation,29 which in turn have led to privileg- ing certain texts, especially for teaching in feminist courses. In addition, I agree with Lillian Robinson that "it is possible to argue for taking all texts seriously as texts without arguments based on social oppression or cultural exclusion."30 If individual poems are to be read only or chiefly as expressions of feminist protest, or as examples of an already identified type, then I fear we have little need of more such poems, and there is no point in expanding the canon to include them. However, I believe there are additional reading and evaluation strategies that can appropriately be applied to recovered poems by nineteenth-century women writers; I believe there are other ways of establishing merit, and other reasons besides politics to include a poem among those we valorize for dissemination and study. Let us continue, since we have begun, with what might be called "nonaesthetic" or extraneous (but not necessarily political) values. It is a truism of Victorian studies that the Victorian era is of par- ticular interest because it is so fascinatingly complex and because the Victorian ideological legacy and cultural debates have exerted so much influence throughout the twentieth century, up to and includ- ing this its last decade. Some poems may appropriately be valued be- cause of their actual historical importance, or their historical interest in retrospect, or indeed even for the contemporary relevance of their subject matter. Such texts may illuminate intriguing aspects of both Victorian and contemporary culture. Furthermore, while it is true that the greater or lesser realism or "authenticity" of a literary repre- sentation has lost credibility as an evaluative criterion, surely New Historicism with its emphasis on cultural disparities of class, race, and gender operating in the particular and definable historical moment of</page><page sequence="11">KATHLEEN HICKOK / 23 a text has absorbed that criterion. Victorian literature is fertile ground for what has come to be known as cultural studies, integrating the analysis of literary texts with investigation of other cultural arti- facts. We have become increasingly aware that cultural hegemony is illusory, and that oppositional discourse is always extant. Newly re- covered texts that foreground or demonstrate the tensions between conflicting Victorian ideologies can be interesting for their revela- tions about either the process or the materialities of such conflicts. The deconstructive possibilities of a text may be relished by those who enjoy that particular methodology and share that theoretical stance. I am calling for critical versatility, with an eye on the mutual suitability of text and methodology. Next, let me just touch on reception theory and reader-response criticism, which concern themselves with immediate and later recep- tion of texts. Sometimes an investigation of the critical reception of poems, in their era of publication and again in the late twentieth century, is in itself interesting. The shifting attitudes toward women writers and their work, the illuminating distinction between poets and poetesses - these are matters of sufficient interest to justify bring- ing back the poems themselves, as in the case of, for example, Letitia Elizabeth Landon.31 Another measure of poetic worth by the yardstick of reader response is what I call the impact test - without lapsing into sentimentalism we can ask, did the poem move me? Has it remained with me? If so, it may well move others, and it is a poem worth re- taining. Such a poem can be made even more interesting if we deconstruct it to discover why and how it found its mark. In the end, it may matter to us whether there are countless poems of the same sort exactly. If there are, we may grow tired of them at last; but I would argue that in recovering and studying Victorian women's po- etry we have not yet reached that saturation point. The Victorian "moral aesthetic" continues to have its adherents as well. While we may agree with Dorothy Mermin that "except in the most expert hands, palpable didacticism is injurious to poetic art, and poems that try to arouse humanitarian feeling seem irredeemably sentimental today" (Godiva's Ride, p. 60), on the other hand, Angela Leighton has been cited approvingly by Gillian Beer for daring "to take the Victorians on their own terms," adopting concepts like "truth" and "life," "faith" and "conscience."32 And Armstrong shows that "often with women writers, the more conventional the didactic lyric, the more accepting of its conventions the writer is, the more it can be used as a way of looking at conformity from within" (Armstrong, p. 336). I am arguing in the same direction as Leighton</page><page sequence="12">24 / VICTORIAN POETRY and Beer. Might we not* even today, value a nineteenth-century poem partly for its moral leadership? Let us assume for a moment that creating empathy across differences and providing insight into the humanity of others counts as morality in art. Is this not the chief ap- peal of, for instance, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's "The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point" and "The Cry of the Children"? I hope the point has been sufficiently made, however sketchily, that nonaesthetic criteria for valorizing literary texts are not only ac- ceptable, but perfectly commonplace in literary and cultural criticism today. Returning to my point about acknowledging the uniqueness of texts, let me just enumerate briefly some of the diverse aesthetic cri- teria that we might use when considering the quality, significance, or interest value of an individual poem. The rather old-fashioned "hu- mane" values of universality, timelessness, and the like have been derogated because of the class, race, and gender biases with which they were often applied, but the values themselves remain viable to the extent that we accept, in this postmodern era, that "humanity" as a category exists, as I believe it does. The "New Critical" aesthetic values of integrity, unity, ambigu- ity, complexity, originality, etc. - these too are considered outmoded today, partly because authorial biography, which New Criticism was thought to exclude, has taken on renewed interest. As Leighton points out, "to ignore the authorial name, and all the historical and biographical information that goes with it, would be to lose, not only an already lost history of women's writing, but also the rationale for writing about women poets at all" (p. 4). Some women's poetry may be valued as much for its connection to the extraordinary (or alterna- tively, paradigmatic) life of the author as for its intrinsic qualities. Lady Caroline Lamb's few poems are interesting primarily for reasons of this kind, as are the recently revived works of Dorothy Wordsworth and Sara Coleridge.33 However, some technical analysis of the poetry is indispensable to a productive close reading, and an appreciation of the formal virtues established by the New Critics still contributes to the pleasure a literary text provides, even while we may also enjoy reading disruptive poetry that destabilizes itself. Lest we be too naive about textual pleasure, I suppose we should acknowledge that the thrill we encounter in any work of art may sometimes be sexual, sometimes self-aggrandizing, sometimes merely (yet profoundly) personal. We may enjoy a poem because, like much genre writing, it provides "confirmation ... of an apparently universal moral system and the security of recognizing [our] place in this order of things."34 These too are criteria, even when idiosyncratic, that are</page><page sequence="13">KATHLEEN H1CKOK / 25 meaningful for us, certainly as readers, and perhaps also as scholars and teachers. In my explications of these four poems, I have included, where relevant, biographical material, social and historical context, infor- mation about the poet's nineteenth-century reception, and matters of literary history and genre, including the specifically female literary tradition. I have attempted to account for diction, metaphor, imag- ery, syntax, tone, metrics, etc. in an integrated close reading. I have been alert to both social and aesthetic commentary appearing within the poems, but I have tried not to overlay particular formulations of feminine poetic consciousness. I chose these particular poems from hundreds in my files because the authors are obscure today though well known in their own life- times, the subject matter was characteristically Victorian, the poetics and thematic statements were invitingly complex, the verse was musi- cal to my ear, and the poems worked well together and even seemed to illustrate thematic development over time. I chose them because each poem seemed to offer its own specific and original human insight and expression. I chose them because they moved me, and remained with me at a human level; I hope my individual readings have indi- cated why. Admittedly, some of these criteria are subjective, and pos- sibly even idiosyncratic (though I hope not, for the sake of my present audience). But I have already asserted that individual readers' responses to a poem are allowable as both methodology and evalua- tion: this is the "intimate egoism" of my title. Finally, I realize that I have not applied every possible methodology to these poems, nor was that my intention; in fact, I expressly invite other approaches and other readings. To secure additional readings for these poems and others like them is, in large part, the purpose of this essay. What, then, are my recommendations? We should certainly make as much of Victorian women's poetry available as possible, including biographical information about the authors, and we should then take this material seriously enough to write and talk about it at length and in detail.35 For we must recognize that serious criticism helps define the complexity and value of texts. No aspect of critical inquiry should be rejected, and, conversely, none by itself will be sufficient to ex- plore these many-faceted poems fully. We want to consider the author's life; her historical and cultural context (time period, race, class, prevailing ideologies, and cultural constraints, etc.); her recep- tion in her own day and after, including how her work matches the needs and interests of readers now; her use of language and of poetic structure and effects; and much more. Individual scholars and critics</page><page sequence="14">26 / VICTORIAN POETRY can and should decide what methodology they are most comfortable and effective with and apply that. As scholars, critics, readers, and teachers, we can be the leaders in exploring the complex value of this literature - but only if we take the time to find it, read it carefully, and comment upon it. Collectively, we can be the authorizers of many additional poems by lesser known, but still worthy, nineteenth- century British women poets. Notes i I prefer to avoid designations like major and minor, first-rate and second- rate, popular and high art, amateur and professional, etc. because they prejudice the reading. Bradford K. Mudge, writing about Sara Coleridge, would push this even further: "For as long as the distinction between literary and nonliterary remains operative, corresponding distinctions between major and minor follow logically. To rethink major and minor, one must rethink the ingrained systems of critical valuation which thus far have kept the concept of the 'literary' securely in place" ("Exiled as Exiler: Sara Coleridge, Virginia Woolf, and the Politics of Literary Revision," in Women's Writing in Exile, ed. Mary Lynn Broe and Angela Ingram [Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1989], p. 216). Lillian S. Robinson challenges us to open literary frontiers "not only to excluded social groups, but to the widest range of expression of those groups' experience. The result would be to see our whole past ... as experienced by all sorts of people with very different relations to the dominant culture and the fact of dominance. And it would be to understand this seeing as a legitimate part of our activity in the world of literary interpretation, not belonging to some other mode of apprehension outside the proper boundaries of criticism" ("Canon Fathers and Myth Universe," NLH 19, no. 1 [Autumn 1987]: 28). 2 I want to thank Rosanne Potter and William McCarthy, colleagues at Iowa State University, for reading an early draft of this essay and making many helpful suggestions. 3 Of course, I do not mean to suggest that women did not write dramatic and narrative poetry, or longer poems. 4 Nancy K.

The poem probably first appeared in 1840 in Cook's Melaia and Other Poems, and undoubtedly was reprinted in Eliza Cook's Journal, which Cook wrote and edited from 1849 to J854- 6 Marcia Kutrieh, "Popular British Romantic Poets," Ph.D. dissertation, Bowling Green State University, 1974, p. 435.</page><page sequence="15">KATHLEEN HICKOK / 27 7 "The Old Arm-Chair," Cook's best known poem of this group, was first published in the Weekly Dispatch in 1837. I have been unable to find out her mother's name or date of death, but Cook's family moved in 1827 from Wimbledon to Sussex. If her mother's death precipitated this move, Cook would have been nine years old. 8 As late as 1881, Dr. R. T. Trail reported that "the health of a majority of women in civilized society is seriously impaired and their lives greatly abbreviated by too frequent pregnancies" (R. T. Trail, Sexual Physiology [London, 1881], p. 203). 9 Alfred H. Miles, ed., The Poets and the Poetry of the Nineteenth Century, (London, 1892), 8:270. 10 C.

The chrysalis, or metamorphosis in general, is a recurrent metaphor in the tradition of women's literature. Some readers may remember a feminist journal of the arts published for a few years in the 1970s called Chrysalis. 18 Sir Charles Lyell's influential book Principles of Geology (1830-1833) "maintained that the causes of geological change in the remote past were no different from those still operative in the nineteenth century - the slow, ceaseless action of wind and water, the elevation and depression of land masses. Such an assumption . . . required extending the chronology into veritable eons" (Richard Altick, Victorian People and Ideas [New York: W. W. Norton, 1973], p. 223). 19 Louisa Bevington, Poems, Lyrics and Sonnets (London, 1882), p. 67. 20 This volume was republished in 1879 under her own name. The allusion to Aurora Leigh is intriguing. 21 Alfred H.

Virginia Blain (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1990), pp. 91-92. 23 As Rita Felski notes, "In the earliest feminist writings on literature . . . female subjectivity provided the central category around which a feminist aesthetic was defined, and feminist critical response was validated on experiential rather than theoretical grounds" (Beyond Feminist Aesthetics: Feminist Literature and Social Change [Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1989], p. 22). A more complex, but related formulation is that of "conflicting subjectivities" of women writers, as explored by, for example, Julia Swindells in Victorian Writing and Working Women: The Other Side of Silence (Cambridge, England: Polity Press, 1985). P- 35- For consciousness of gender, see Dorothy Mermin, Godiva's Ride: Women of Letters in England, 1830*1880 (Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana Univ. Press, 1993), p. xix. In 1993 Mermin seems oddly pessimistic in accepting the judgment that women poets were so hampered by social constraints and masculine poetic traditions that they were not really very numerous or very good: "Felicia Hemans and Letitia Landon early in the century, and Adelaide Procter and Jean Ingelow later on, had considerable lyric gifts and were extremely popular, but they have been long and no doubt irrevocably forgotten" (p. 60). I believe these and other Victorian women poets she has not mentioned are currently (and I hope, irrevocably) recovered. Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar discuss authorial repression, anxiety, and eruption in The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1979). See especially Chap. 2, "Infection in the Sentence," pp. 45-92. Mary Jean Corbett tackles doubleness in Representing Femininity: Middle- Class Subjectivity in Victorian and Edwardian Women's Autobiographies (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1992), p. 69. Corbett is referring to Aurora Leigh, and specifically to what she sees as an ideological contradiction in Elizabeth Barrett Browning as "a woman who empowers herself by speaking the language of the fathers" (p. 70). In the critical introduction to her new, authoritative edition of Aurora Leigh (Athens: Ohio Univ. Press, 1992), Margaret Reynolds also refers to Barrett Browning's "sense of doubleness" as a poet and a woman (p. 11). Isobel Armstrong asserts that "the doubleness of women's poetry comes from its ostensible adoption of an affective mode, often simple, often pious, often conventional. But those conventions are subjected to investigation, questioned, or used for unexpected purposes" (Isobel Armstrong, Victorian Poetry: Poetry, Poetics and Politics [New York: Routledge, 1993], p- 324)- Armstrong's lengthy chapter on Victorian women's poetry, "A Music of Thine Own: Women's Poetry - An Expressive Tradition?" contains brilliant readings of individual poems by Felicia Hemans, Adelaide Anne Procter, Jean Ingelow, and other lesser known poets. For entrapment, see, for example, Elsie B. Michie, Outside the Pale: Cultural Exclusion, Gender Difference, and the Victorian Woman Writer (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1993).

Press, 1992), p. 16. See also Mary Poovey, Uneven Developments: The Ideological Work of Gender in Mid-Victorian England (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1988), p. 4. Amanda Anderson considers revisionist moments in Tainted Souls and Painted Faces: The Rhetoric of Fallenness in Victorian Culture (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1993), p. 197. See also Adrienne A. Munich, Andromeda's Chains: Gender and Interpretation in Victorian Literature and Art (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1989). Munich discovers "subversive stories" and "counter-tales" about gender and power (p. 7) in some male Victorian writers' use of familiar myths like Andromeda. 24 I count myself among these. See Kathleen Hickok, Representations of Women: Nineteenth-Century British Women's Poetry (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1984). Exemplary poetic texts of this kind include Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh and Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market, both of which have received a great deal of critical attention in the last decade, as a search of the MLA Bibliography will quickly demonstrate. 25 See Anne Wilson Schaef, Women's Reality: An Emerging Female System in the White Male Society (Minneapolis: Winston Press, 198 1), on male vs. female systems. 26 According to Reynolds, this feminist folk-poetics "traces a 'female' tradition (without any consciousness of the possible interference of a wish-fulfillment) inherited from our mothers (qualified to endow by simple biology) which is usually an oral tradition (and consequently without trace) and often a mysterious one, related to a spiritual and moral sphere (which returns women's poetry to its conventional place)" (p. 10). 27 Even Felski, who rejects the notion of a feminist aesthetics, has to acknowledge that "feminist criticism has . . . been able to show convincingly that certain themes and preoccupations occur in much, although by no means all, of women's writing" (pp. 29-30). 28 Elaine Showalter, A Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from Bronte to Lessing (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1977), and Gilbert and Gubar, The Madwoman in the Attic, are examples of major texts that contributed to defining women's literature in this way. 29 Poovey summarizes "the task in which many twentieth-century feminists have been engaged and from which many of us have gained self- consciousness and collective identification - the task of excavating and reevaluating the lives of forgotten women" (pp. 200-201). Similarly, Patrocinio Schweickart writes, "Feminist reading and writing alike are grounded in the interest of producing a community of feminist readers and writers, and in the hope that ultimately this community will expand to include everyone" ("Reading Ourselves: Toward a Feminist Theory of Reading," in Gender and Reading: Essays on Readers, Texts, and Contexts, ed. Elizabeth Flynn and Patrocinio Schweickart [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1986], p. 56). Elizabeth D. Ermat writes in "Feminist Theory as a Practice," "What feminists want is this: the assimilation of women and their issues, their methods, their concerns, their language, their habits into a mainstream</page><page sequence="18">3o / VICTORIAN POETRY completely redefined by that transfusion. . . . The test of whether a theory is worth anything, it seems to me, is its effect on the solidarity of women and on the practices of a culture" (Feminist Critical Negotiations, ed. Alice A. Parker and Elizabeth A. Meese [Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1992], pp. 5, 15). 30 Lillian S. Robinson, "Treason Our Text: Feminist Challenges to the Literary Canon," TSWL 2 (1983): 93. Robinson says this helps explain why popular genres have been included as part of the female literary tradition: "Feminist criticism has examined without embarrassment an entire literature that was previously dismissed solely because it was popular with women and affirmed standards and values associated with femininity" (p. 93). 31 See Glennis Stephenson, "Letitia Landon and The Victorian Improvisa- trice: The Construction of L.E.L.," VP 30 (1992): 1-17. 32 Angela Leighton, Victorian Women Poets: Writing Against the Heart (New York: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1992); reviewed by Gillian Beer in the TLS, November 13, 1992, p. 24. 33 I do not mean that these women's lives are interesting for what they reveal about famous male writers; I refer here to the work of Margaret Homans, Anne K. Mellor, and others who have investigated women's position in British literature, philosophy, and society of the Romantic period. See, for example, Margaret Homans, Women Writers and Poetic Identity: Dorothy Wordsworth, Emily Bronte, and Emily Dickinson (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1980); Anne K. Mellor, ed., Romanticism and Feminism (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1988); and Bradford K. Mudge, Sara Coleridge: A Victorian Daughter (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1989). 34 Lynda Nead, Myths of Sexuality: Representations of Women in Victorian Britain (New York: Basil Blackwell, 1988), p. 190. Mead is discussing Victorian paintings of prostitutes. 35 I have been pleased to see that this enterprise is underway. For example, the program at the Annual Conference on 18th- and 19th-century British Women Writers, which first convened in 1992, consistently includes numerous well-developed and insightful papers by graduate students and professors about the poets mentioned in this essay and many others. In addition, articles about Jean Ingelow, Augusta Webster, Alice Meynell, and others are beginning to appear in mainstream journals like Victorian Poetry and Victorian Studies, and in critical anthologies like At the Limits of Romanticism: Essays in Cultural, Feminist, and Materialist Criticism, ed. Mary A. Favret and Nicola J. Watson (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1994), which are not exclusively feminist in their critical orientation. The latter text contains articles on Felicia Hemans and on Dorothy Wordsworth and Ann Yearsley.
