[Argues that " evolution is history; that antecedents and causes should consequently be historically construed; that evolution is pluralistic, implying many histories but no single history of the world; that man writes the history only of his own world; that, however, since he discovers his world to be a history, he may have a science of history or evolution which is universal; and that this science indicates that evolution is progressive ".] E. B. McUilvary. ' The Relation of Self- consciousness and Object in Sense-perception.' [The relational view of consciousness is compatible with the recognition that the same real object is in different consciousnesses. (1) A real object may be a many-in-one with the same logical right as any 'single field of experience'. Pending analysis of the conception of continuity, it is not necessary to conceive (with 'natural' realism) that continuity of perceived surface is unreal, when the real surface is discontinuous. (2) Impenetrability is not a universal characteristic of space-occupying things. (3) Consciousness has a limited eternity and ubiquity, but its ubiquity and eternity radiate from the here and now. Contemporaneity is not to be confused with simultaneity. (4) 'Consciousness of consciousness' is a misnomer for an actual fact. An object of attention need not be an object of conscious- ness; it may be consciousness itself.] L. W. Flaccus. ' Moral Ex- perience.' [The phrase 'moral experience' is meant to save ethics from subjectivism and metaphysical occultism. It may be interpreted bio- logically, psychologically, or autoteleologically. But the biological interpretation makes mistaken use of the objective, and therefore fails to catch the full implications of the moral as opposed to the non-moral and the immoral; the psychological is a descriptive frittering away of the whole problem; the autoteleological is guilty either of excessive simplicity of reading (Kantian type) or of laxity of method and ambiguous definitions (types of pragmatism and personal idealism). The future lies with the two modern types of the autoteleological interpretation; but they must rigorously reform their methods, and must undertake a per- sistent and discriminating treatment of special ethical problems.] E. 0.

[Review of the conflicting results of previous work; report of new experiments. So far as regards the immediate memory of adults, auditory is clearly su- perior to visual presentation for all materials (nouns, nonsense syllables, numbers), for various forms of imaginal type, and for one, two, or three presentations. Visual-auditory presentation is slightly inferior to audi- tory, .and decidedly superior to visual; visual-auditory-motor presentation</page><page sequence="2">148 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. is slightly inferior to auditory and visual-auditory, and superior to visual. The correlations of abilities with different forms of presentation are positive and very high.] R. S. Woodworth. 'Combining the Results of Several Tests: a Study in Statistical Method.' [Given results from several tests of the same individual, how can we combine them so as to measure the success of each individual in the tests as a whole ? Various rough methods have been followed ; what is needed is a method which shall preserve all the refinement of the original measurements. Such a method is familiar to statisticians; and the purpose of the writer is to expound it, and also to work out simplified formulas, which may be used for computing correlations when the method has been employed. Once the individualist's standing in any number of tests has been found, the additional labour of computing, correlations is slight. The formulas offered are in part mnathematically equivalent to those usually employed, in part (if these others are taken as norms) approximative only; it, does not necessarily follow that the latter are less nearly correct.] J. E. Boodin. ':EKnowing Selves.' [In trying to know the self, we are concerned with the finite self and its processes; and our method must be naturalistic. We know other selves neither by analogical in- ference nor by mystical appreciation, but as we know ourselves, through the situations upon which we react. In particular, (1) there is a state of bare awareness, simpler than any involving the I-me relation; that relation itself is, however, merely the relation of selective content and selected object; in it the I and the me constantly change places; both are functions of a system of tendencies which strives to. realise itself and which may be called ' self' in an inclusive sense. (2) Self-identity does not need the hypothesis of substance; constancy and change are both given facts of experience; while attention flickers, the context of interest may be lifelong. (3) There are unities in experience, but absolute uniqueness is a dogma; sometimes the self is partial; and there are different grades of unity. (4) Activity and freedom do not mean novelty; they imply the realisation of an aim; and this is there or not there, whether the stream of tendencies or a transcendental knower is the agent. In like manner, o6ur method leaves unimpaired, (5) the value and worth of conduct.] Discussion. A. E. Davies. 'Professor Titchener's Theory of Memory and Imagination.' E. B. Titchener.

In the first series, the strength of the odour was rather increased than lessened by the ac- companying sound. Hence in a second series the observers were instructed to relax attention to the odour ; still there was no marked inhibition. Thirdly, concentrated attention was given to the sound; now the odour was weakened. The attention, upon which inhibition depended, is largely a matter of representative and other processes associated to the sound; the author therefore refers sensory inhibition to the action of such 'ad- ducent' processes.] G. S. Hall. 'Why Kant is Passing.' [Outline, with running commentary, of the Critique of Pure Reason, the Critique of Practical Reason, the Religion within the Bonds of Pur-e Reason, and the Critiqtue of Judgment.

The author then deals briefly with the relation to Kant of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, and distinguishes the three stages in the post-Kantian movement; Kantian orthodoxy, the applica- tion of the historical or comparative method, and current geneticism. The task of the present day is to psycho-analyse the great system-makers, not on the Freudian basis of sex, but on that of religion, and thus to understand them; it is wholly wrong to force such cumbersome thought- machinery as that of the Kantian epistemology upon our academic youth.] E. B. Titchener. ' Prolegomena to a Study of Introspection.' [Shows, with copious illustration, that introspection is still regarded as the most important means of psychological knowledge; scientific introspection must, however, be sharply distinguished from that of moralising common sense or of reflective philosophy. Introspection implies self-consciousness only as all scientific observation implies it; and the employment of the method need not itself be conscious. While introspection presupposes the standpoint of descriptive psychology, it cannot furnish a psycholo- gical system; like other scientific methods, it simply offers materials which may be worked up into a system.] C.

[The argument of this clearly and carefully written series of papers is that 'feeling' and 'aware- ness' must be distinguished. 'Consciousness' as feeling is psychical existence and starts from the recognition of "images " as "a perfectly plain and unequivocal fact". They are other than their objects, their relation to their objects must be conceived as mediating them. ii. They stand for their objects as a photograph stands for a person. The fact that images are later than objects "Suggests if it does not actually prove" that the objects exist independently. But the existence of images is psychical originally, and it remains to account for their pro- jection into the object. iii. The image prompts us to act as if the object were at a certain point. The image taken with its motor promptings explains what we perceive, and projection is " a rooted habit of seeing the object in the guise of the image yet where the image is not".] M. W. Calkins.

The Thomist distinction of primary and secondary moral precepts is shown to be an adequate recognition of such variation of the moral law as goes with the varying conditions of human nature. ] ler Juillet, 1912.

'Die Sinnesdaten im " Ring des Nibelungen "; optisches und akustisches Material.' [A study, qualitative and quantitative, of the words denoting visual and auditory qualities used by Wagner in the "Ring"; comparison with Goethe, Shakespeare, Spenser, Schiller and others. Wagner's imagina- tion is strongly visual, and only moderately auditory; the factor of speech is in him much stronger than in Goethe and Schiller, that of non-articulate sounds much weaker; he operates very little with colours, but more of ten than any other author so far investigated with neutral visual qualities and with words denoting glow, glitter, lustre; words of this latter group are especially favoured by musical writers.] E. Bischoff. 'Untersuchungen iiber UbungsfThigkeit und Ermiidbarkeit bei "geistiger" und "korperlicher" Arbeit.' [A differential study of mental work (addition) and bodily work (dynamograph) in the case of twelve subjects (men: 11 attendants, 1 physician). The results permit the arrangement of these subjects in the order of liability to fatigue, bodily and mental, and capacity of practice, mental only. There is no correlation between bodily and mental fatigue; between mental fatigue and practice; between (mental) practice and bodily fatigue. The positive results are rather the establishment, under all three heads, of marked individual differences, and the exposition of a simple and reliable method for the measurement of the phenomena in question.] A. Kronfeld. ' Experimentelles zum Mechanismus der Auffassung.' I 'Apprehension' is the process whereby we become conscious of a non-spatial objectified content, e.g., of the meaning of a sentence; the 'non-spatial' marks it off from 'perceptioni'. We find the specific function of apprehension characterised, though inadequately, by Kant (dynamic synthesis), Wundt (apperception), and the recent representatives of the psychology of act or function, Husserl, Stumpf, Messer, Erdmann. To ascertain its psychological nature, we must mark off, experimentally, whatever in its mechanism is purely associative. Tachistoscopic experi- ments with 'associative constellation' (foregone suggestion), made oln normal and abnormal subjects, lead to the distinction of four types of apprehenston: the normal, the manic, the psychopathic, the demented; all show, in varying manner and degree, that associative mechanisms can influence the mode and direction of objectification in the act of apprehension. A second important factor in the mechanism of apprehen- sion is found in the properties and characters of the letter-forms and word-forms presented; form of combination and position within the complex of letters have their special efficacy; with sense-material we misread far more often than we overlook. Experiments with pictures confirm the results already outlined. The introspective reports are reserved for later publication.] M. Hirschfeld. ' tYber die Lokalization der Sexualzentren.'

ZEITSCHRIFT F. PSYCHOLOGIE. Bd. lx., Heft 3. A. Hoffler. 'Gestalt und Beziehung; Gestalt und Anschauung.' [After a preliminary discus- sion of arguments against (Gelb, Marty) and for the 'form of combination' (Hoofler, 'Benussi, Schmied-Kowarzik), the writer proceeds (1) to his negative thesis, that the form of combination is not explicable in terms of relation. Manifolds, he maintains, are either formed or unformed. Form of combination never appears apart from relations; and the rela- tions may, in whole or part, be taken up (at least subjectively) into the form. But the form is as objective as the relations and the absolute contents which 'ground' them, and cannot itself be reduced to either. The term Gestaltqualitdt is useful, not only as indicating the quale of form, but also as emphasising the immediacy of this quale in experience. (2) On the positive side, the writer proposes to use the term Anschauung for the (ideational) act of apprehension of form. To use it for the act of formation (Gestattungsakt instead of Gestatterfassungsakt) would involve the subject in the controversy regarding the production (Produzieren) of ideas. This he desires to avoid; he believes however-to take a concrete case-that "melodies are not invented but discovered".] Literatur- bericht. Gesellschaft fur experimentelle Psychologie. "SCIENTIA."

[In the previous discussions on the use of the infinite in mathematics in which Poincare joined, each side kept on repeating the same arguments. There seems, in fact, a fundamental difference in mentality among mathematicians; some, whom Poincare calls "Pragmatists," believe that the infinite is derived from the finite, and all verification and all definition is performed with a finite number of words; others, the " Cantorians," believe that there are objects and truths which cannot be defined or demonstrated in a finite number ef words. The Cantorians are realists and believe that the truth of a proposition does not depend on its verification by us. It is not difficult to place Poincare, on the grounds of some of his writings, among those whom he not wholly inappropriately calls " Pragmatists ". But by his strange statement that the " Pragmatists," but not the "Cantorians," reject what Mr. Russell calls "vicious circle fallacies," Poincare would apparently place Mr. Russell among the " Pragmatists ". ] K.

[One of tho reasons which have decided the author to returni to the question of space and time is the revolution in our ideas on mechanics lately brought about by the principle of relativity (Lorentz). It might appear that the principle leads us to form a wholly new conception of space and time, and to show that geometry is not out of the reach of assaults of experience. However, we need not modify our conclusions: we have adopted a convention because it seemed convenient. At the present time certain physicists wish to</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 153 ;adopt a new convention because they think it more convenient. That is the whole state of the question, and anybody can legitimately keep to the old way of thinking so as not to disturb his old habits.

[Occupied with the philosophical problem of finding the value of the critique of the principles of mathematics, and the place belonging to this critique in the progress of science. The author finds, both with the notions of ,continuity and infinitesimals with the Greeks and up to the times of Newton and Leibniz, and with other parts of more modern mathematics, that progress-both extensive and intensive-is a function of the critique of principles; and that this critique is not a new phenomenon but an essential part of the elaboration of concepts which at every period pre- pares for or accompanies the progress of science or its more extended application. Philosophically speaking, the most interesting part of this article is on what the author calls " pragmatism " and " naturalism ". The father of philosophical pragmatism which has resulted in an anti- scientific reaction is the pragmatism of the mathematical logiLians who, armed with the critique of principles, maintain the arbitrary character ,of definitions and postulates against the " naturalistic " conception (based on naive realism) which considers mathematical entities as existing out- side us and as thus being objects of discovery.
