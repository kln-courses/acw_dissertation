<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON THE SUNDAY GOSPELS by J. G. McGarry. SECOND SUNDAY OF LENT. The ' high mountain ' is either Mt. Thabor (2,017 feet), the traditional choice, or Mt. Hermon (9,383 feet), much further north. Some think the events described occurred at night time, but that view has not much support. The three apostles chosen here were the same who were present at the raising of Jairus's daughter, and in Gethsemani. These were Christ's intimate friends, and if they were to witness His agony and sweat of blood in Gethsemani, they would be strengthened against the seeming scandal of His Passion. St. John had this experience in mind particularly, when he wrote his gospel : " We saw His glory as of the only begotten of the Father " (John I 14), echoing, unconsciously perhaps, the words of the Father. St. Peter too (2 Peter I. 16-18). The change in the person of Christ radiated through His clothes. It should be noted that this shining through of Christ's Divinity does not strike terror and awe into the apostles as did the cloud (v. 5) and the voice of the Father. The figures of Moses and Elias, recognised perhaps from their manner of speech or from traditional representation, typified the Law and the Prophets, both of which looked to the Passion of Christ as to their fulfilment. St. John Chrysostom gives many reasons for the presence of these two ; to counter the charge that Christ was against the Law, ' ' to show the glory of the Cross . . . since they (i.e. Moses and Elias) spoke of the . . . Passion and Cross . . . For each of them both spoke boldly to tyrants, the one to the Egyptian, the other to Ahab, and on behalf of heartless and disobedient men, and by the very persons who were saved by them, they were brought into extreme danger . . . and each being unlearned " ; they were to cheer St. Peter and the others in the trials to come. St. Peter's remark was characteristic, spoken out of his unthinking, eager enthusiasm, ' not knowing what he said ' (St. Luke). Perhaps he thought of spending the night there in bothies or shielings which could easily be run up. St. John Chrysostom thinks St. Peter spoke out of his warm, but as yet imperfect love for Christ and the desire to shield Him. ' ' He has great security here, and if we do not go up to Jerusalem, He will not die, for there He said the Scribes would set upon Him." The cloud and the voice of God fill the apostles with fear (cf. Exodus XVI., XIX., XX.). "Listen to him," not momentarily but habitually. How comforting was the touch of the humanity of Christ in this place of dread and in the presence of God ! ' ' Looking round them," a characteristic little detail by St. Mark. 40</page><page sequence="2">Notes on the Sunday Gospels This passage illustrates very clearly the remarkable sobriety and objec tivity of the Gospels, which contrasts strangely with apocryphal writings. Nothing is dramatised or enlarged ; all is set down coldly and with quite obvious truthfulness, which is only emphasised by the little differences of detail. This unique quality of the Gospels shown so strikingly in this passage is wholly convincing. Grace and Glory : By Baptism men become sons of God, adopted sons. And this adoption makes us in some way like Our Redeemer, the natural Son of God. As yet at Baptism this likeness is imperfect, but when we inherit the glory of our Father's kingdom, our likeness to Him is completed, then " He will form this humbled body of ours anew, moulding it to the image of His glorified body " (Philippians III. 21). Growing in grace then, we grow daily more and more like Christ, until we grow to the full size of Christ (Eph. IV. 13). On earth the glory of our souls is a real glory, a sharing in the life of God, but its brilliance is hidden as yet. ' ' We are sons of God even now, and what we shall be hereafter, has not been made known yet. But we know that when He comes we shall be like Him." Father Faber's saying that grace is glory in exile and glory is grace at home is a forceful expression of this teaching of the New Testament. From this truth we see the greatness of the life of grace, and man's dignity and nobility as sharer of the life of God. This thought is beautifully condensed in the Collect of to-day's Mass. The Transfiguration : The preacher could enlarge on the nature of the transfiguration. The glory of Christ in His transfiguration radiated from the glory of His soul which it had from the beginning, but which the power of God prevented from overflowing upon His Body during His life except, for this occasion, ' ' so that he might in a body that was liable to suffering fulfil the mystery of our redemption." (St. Thomas) The brightness, was not like brightness of a glorified body in which it isa permanent habit ; here it was a passing influence. The brightness did not disfigure or change the shape of Christ ; His features and form changed in no way. Here with Elias and Moses was the familiar head and hands that we look upon daily nailed to the Cross. When we are apt to forget the divinity and glory of Christ, we should see on the Cross against the wood, not the thorn-crowned head, the pierced hands and side but the transfigured Christ of Thabor, a prophetic glimpse of the Son of Man returning in glory. Christ at other times displayed powrers which are normal to a glorified body, agility in moving over the waters, subtility in passing from the womb of His Virgin Mother, impassibility when He gave His body to be eaten at the Last Supper. Only on this occasion did He allow the transfulgent brightness of His Soul appear. Purpose ; To strengthen the apostles against the scandal of His Passion. It has a lesson for all men : Glory that is in us : . if we suffer with Him, we shall be glorified with Him. This foretaste which Christ gave of the glory was an earnest, a pledge 41</page><page sequence="3">The Furrow of the greater glory " which shall be revealed in us," for it exists m us if we are Sons of God, and only awaits death to reveal it. How much greater and lovlier it is than the sensual beauty that the world prizes. Fallax gratia, vana pulchritudo (Proverbs XXXI., 30)?except this beauty of soul. Occasionally great artists uncover a little of this beauty of soul, the light within the body, in such masterpieces as Michelangelo's "Christ" or his "Adam." That artist loved the beauty which was the splendour of the Divine Face. In one of his sonnets he says : ' ' God does not manifest Himself anywhere more powerfully than in a mortal frame where the eye reflects the virtous soul." Moments of spiritual rapture are rare and are only intended to strengthen us or encourage us in a crisis. Some souls mistakenly expect what they call "the consolations of religion," more properly bodily feelings of devotion, to be a daily feature of spiritual living. Life is a warfare, earth is a vale of tears ; our food must be the bread and water of labour and penance. The lights of Thabor are rare and are by no means the special signs of God's love. Sufferers are His favourites. For long years St. Teresa felt no sensible feeling of devotion whatever. (The preacher should also consult the liturgy of the Feast of Trans figuration?August 6th). THIRD SUNDAY OF LENT. Lake XL 14-28; (Mt. XII. 22-45; Mk. III. 20-30). The aptness of the Gospels for the Sundays of Lent should not pass without notice. They are so many acts in the drama of Christ's struggle against the power of evil ; the temptation, the issue knit between Christ and Satan, who, defeated, retires "until the time"; the transfiguration, a moment of bliss which heightens the d?nouement ; in to-day's Gospel, again the argument is the struggle with Satan involving us all, ' ' he that is not with Me is against Me " ; the fourth Sunday dramatically shows the power of Christ in the miracle of the loaves, leading to the attempt by the mob to make Him king ?f the Jews, one of their own making ; on Passion Sunday we hear the rattle of paving stones hurled against the man who claimed to have existed before Abraham was made ; Palm Sunday brings an ominous calm in the struggle, all conflict seems resolved as the whole city of Jerusalem resounds with vivas and hosannas to the King, to make such a tragic contrast to the events of the days that followed. Throughout the series there is a remarkable unity of theme, the Struggle for a Throne. To-day we are at act three with the Pharisees in their familiar role, attempting to stir up trouble against Jesus. Envy and evil thoughts have led them to this blasphemous suggestion. The " dumb devil " means that the devil deprived the man possessed of the power of speech. What sign from heaven would convince men who had shown such perversion of reasoning as to attribute this miracle to diabolic influence ? Christ reads their thoughts before they spoke them, a further sign from heaven for those who clamour for signs, not believing the wonders done before their eyes. Beelzebub means ' Lord of Flies ' ; if Beelzebul, ' Lord of Dung,' both expressive names for the Archfiend. Christ's argument is twofold. First He shows the impos 42</page><page sequence="4">Notes on the Sunday Gospels sibility of the Pharisees' blasphemous suggestion and then uses against His traducors an argumentum ad hominen. 'Your sons' would refer probably to Jewish exorcists. Exorcisms were then common. The little parable (v. 21-22) tells of Christ's victory in two simple pictures, Satan at rest in his kingdom and then his power broken and scattered. Christ's victory over Satan was accomplished finally only after the Passion. St. Augustine speaking of the vessels that the Conquerer scatters says: "We are His vessels. Satan had filled them with his own bitterness. And this bitterness he toasted to our Redeemer in the gall. He had filled us then as his vessels, but Our Lord spoiling his vessels and making them His own, poured out the bitterness, filling them with sweetness." (In Joan VI.).. The unclean spirit is pictured by Christ in anthropomorphic terms. The passage is simply a parable intended only to convey the application Christ intended, that the generation who heard His words and had not recog nised the Kingdom of God come amongst them, was worse than it had been before the signs and wonders of His coming. The woman, touched by His words, praises Christ in a mother's way. Her warm woman's heart had no doubt been hurt by the horrible accusations of the Pharisees. Christ's reply is not, of course, as curt as it seems in the Douay translation. The Greek conjunction suggests " Yes, indeed, but isn't it rather." " It is still more clear," says Lagrange, ' ' that Christ's reply was not a contradiction ; it would have been too unfeeling to tell a woman that the pains and affection of a mother counted for nothing. No one but Calvin would attribute such a sentiment to Jesus." Envy : The horrible blasphemy of the Pharisees had its root in their envy of Christ. For that reason the capita! or deadly sins are so called that they lead to other sins (in another sense of course all grave sins are deadly). In his homily on this passage St. John Chrysostom considers how little notice people take of this sin. 'f No man-, at any tim?, but if he fasts, and gives a little money to a poor man, though he be envious to the thousandth degree, counts himself to have done nothing horrid, hel? as he is in slavery by the most accursed passion ?f all. Whence the children of Lab?n ? Whence Core, Dathan and Abiron, with their company ? Whence the Devil himself?" Envy feeds on others' evil " as beetles on dung," St. John Chrysostom adds. It brings no happiness to itself and can corrupt the world, turning what is best to foulness, putting wrong construction on noble and upright deeds, attributing the most virtuous deeds to selfish and ignoble motives. Envy is at least latent and potential in us all. It is so plausible, too. "It begins by asking plausibly ' why should not I enjoy what others enjoy ? ' and it ends by demanding, 'why should others enjoy what I have not?' " (Dorothy Sayers). Gradually envy can lead to hatred of every generous act and of every person better than oneself. ' ' This ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor. Then our nostrils would not be offended by any odour of sanctity, the house would not be filled with the smell of the ointment " (Dorothy Sayers). "Why for instance did the Pharisees say that Christ was possessed ? Was it not because they were greedy of the honour of the multitude ? And 43</page><page sequence="5">The Furrow whence did the multitude pass the right judgement on them ? Was it not because this disease had no hold on them ? Nothing, nothing so much tends to make men lawless and foolish as gaping after the honour of the multitude. Nothing makes them glorious and immovable like despising it."?St. John Chrysostom. Texts : i Cor. III. 13 ; James III. 14-16. Relapse into Sin : Two factors in every friendship are affection and fidelity. For a friend ship restored after a breach, greater affection and greater fidelity are necessary. He who has had the greatest remission required the greatest love, Simon thought and Jesus confirmed (Luke VII. 42-43). A more solemn and sincere covenant of friendship is required to repair a broken friendship. Yet contrast the light hearted, inconsistent and loveless penance of the relapsing sinner. Penance must be sincere, if it is to satisfy God's justice. Otherwise it would be only a contrivance to flatter vice. Yet relapsing sinners think so lightly of the justice of God, and of their sins. They ' ' drink iniquity like water " (Job. XV. 16) and pass light heartedly from sin to penance. But they show no fruit of penance, no mature, ripe fruit of penance but only green, sour fruit. It is the fatal ease with which such relapsing sinners confess that gives cause for trembling for their salvation and doubting the sincerity of their contrition. If there were signs of struggle, of troubling of conscience, of effort to overthrow the old tyranny of custom?but there is none. The limitless mercy of God such sinners abuse to their ruin. Relapse (1) puts God still further from us, (2) strengthens our evil inclinations and habits. (3) weakens the power of grace in us, so that even the greatest truths in time make no impression on us. (4) adds the growing malice of ingratitude. FOURTH SUNDAY OF LENT. John XL 1-15 ; (Mt. XIX. 13-23 ; Mk. XL 30-46; Luke IX. 10-17). The time is shortly after the Galilean mission of the second year of the public ministry. Christ has brought the Apostles across the Sea of Galilee to a quiet place on the east side near Bethsaida to rest them (Mk.). They find, however, on landing that the throng has followed them round by the shore, twice as long a route (St. Mark's vivid details bring the scene sharply to life). Noticing that He is tired after a day of teaching and preaching, the disciples suggest to Christ that He dismiss the crowd, who were in need of food and rest. Christ's reply is to suggest that the apostles might be able to find food. Philip is named, for his local knowledge?he was a native of Bethsaida?might be useful. The apostles' efforts succeed in bringing to light only five barley loaves and two fishes for a crowd that would need ?8 worth of bread to give each one a little. St. John Chrysostom points out how circumstances confirmed the miracle ; all human means had clearly failed ; there were 5,000 men not counting women and children ;.. the place was a desert ; ' yet though the place is a desert, He that feeds the world is here ' ; the time is evening and the 44</page><page sequence="6">Notes on the Sunday Gospels hunger of the crowd so evident to all, that without bread they would surely faint on the way back to their towns and villages. The very careful preparations heightened still further the expectancy and attention of the multitudes. There is to be no stampeding, but re collected and quiet preparation ; some people who dislike the ordering of communicants, so very necessary in crowded churches, might consider this action of Christ in first having the multitude be quiet and seat themselves according to His orders ; ' and they took their places in rows by hundreds and fifties' (Mk. VI. 40). Note the four gestures of Christ, looking to heaven, giving thanks, bless ing, breaking, exactly as at the Last Supper. ' ' Why did He look to Heaven and bless ? " asks St. John Chrysostom. " So honouring Him that begot Him, so He acts . . . doing all with great lowliness and invoking Him on His works . . . instructing us not to touch a meal, until we have given thanks to Him who gives this food," Christ broke first the bread and then the fishes. The disciples are bidden to serve it out, hereby to honour them." For the disciples a strange experience, to take into their laps and distribute this marvellous bread that they had seen multiply in the venerable hands of their Master, and dole it out as if it were the most common and mundane matter. A rich presage, too, of their enthusiastic service in the priesthood of His Body. We should not overlook the action of Christ in gathering up the fragments, ' lest they go to loss '?His own words. This plain lesson against waste is especially relevant in our age. Is there anything in the fact that there twelve baskets ? St. John Chrysostom thinks so ; there was one for each apostle, ' ' that Judas also might bear one." One can imagine how rapidly the idea caught on that this was the prophet, the one who was to come (Deut. XVIII. 18). Another Moses had fed his people " furnished a table in the wilderness." (Ps. LXXVII. 19). (Dorothy Sayers' play ' ' Bread of Heaven "in " The Man Born to be King " is a very interesting dramatisation of this incident). But Jesus slips away from them ; He must come to His throne at another time and in His own way. The Blessed Eucharist : From the beginning the Church has understood this miracle as pre figuring in a special way the Blessed Eucharist. St. John makes the con nection clear by giving the sublime Eucharistie discourse of Our Lord which this miracle occasioned. The preacher can find there rich material for to-day's homily. Here are some points : Our need of the Blessed Eucharist, the Bread of Life, is no less than that of the hungry throng in the desert. " Factus cibus viatorum "? " travellers "?the familiar word that describes officially our status?' homo viator.' We are in a desert, too, and far from home and famished with hunger for the bread that gives life for ever. How many, intoxicated with the pleasures of the world and pride of life, feel no need for this bread, and sweat and labour instead " to earn food which perishes in the using " (Jo. VI. 27). This is the true " bread from heaven that contains all delight " and gives energy and life to the soul. 45</page><page sequence="7">The Furrow Our daily bread. How some of these 5,000 would recall in their old age this sensational miracle ("I saw it, I tell you, with my own two eyes. I saw the lad bring them the two mackerel and when He put His blessed hands on them?I wasn't far from Him?there were creels of them, bigger than the biggest catch you ever saw at the quay below.") Yet how much less this was than to have His Body for our food, and that not the event and memory of a lifetime, but of every day if we so wished. The very riches and bounty of God in this most adorable Sacrament we make of no account, cheapening it by a routine acceptance, or worse still turning a deaf ear to His invitation, caring nothing or alleging " more important matters." If we but knew the gift of God. (John IV. 10). Blessed Eucharist for the Journey Home : Viaticum : How we all hope to prepare for that reception. Then we are tired out with travel, with false delights of the world, the will almost has forgotten its life-long passion. ' ' For even the purest delight must pall, And power must fail, and the pride must fall And the love of the dearest friends grow small." May we then have the strong arm of Christ's Sacraments to support us and His Body for our Food. We should pray regularly for that grace and have in every Communion the thought of that last one. Gratitude for the Seasons : In the lesson from St. Augustine in to-day's office we are reminded that the wonders of God's government of the world are no less stupendous, if less sensational than the feeding of five thousand with a few loaves. Such wonders grow cheap in our eyes because they are continued and regular. What a miracle spring is and rebirth of nature, and yet how little we thank God for it all and what overwhelming matter for gratitude it is. " Benedicite, universa germinantia in terra, Domino "? The Canticle of the Three Children. Grace at Meals : Its value as reminding us so often of our primal dependence on God's mercy. " Thy gifts . . . thy bounty." We especially who have never known hunger, when so many better than us were starving. Grace should not be a perfunctory gesture but a real prayer. Recently (Summer, 1947) a Dutch Catholic journalist visiting Dublin for the first time numbered among the things that surprised him that so few people in such a Catholic city said grace in restaurants. Note we pray God's blessing on ourselves, and then on the food, His gift, so that we may honour Him by eating and drinking, and sustain the body's service to the soul. PASSION SUND A Y. John VIII. 46-59. The occasion is the Feast of Tabernacles which Our Lord was celebrating in the temple. To the crowds Christ spoke with great candour and power. The picture of themselves that He showed them did not flatter the Jews and excited still more their hatred for the teacher who unmasked them. ' ' We 46</page><page sequence="8">Notes on the Sunday Gospels are Abraham's children," they boasted. " If you are Abraham's children," Christ replied, " take after him." Their real father was the devil, He told them, the father of lies, and as sons of the Liar they could not believe Christ because He was speaking the truth. The rebuke is a bitter draught to these Jews, and in their impotent rage they blaspheme and call Christ a Samaritan, a term of contempt and opprob rium, and even say He is possessed by a devil. Strange answer indeed to the plainest challenge ever given?' ' Which of you can prove Me guilty fo sin ? Could any man ever leave himself so open to his enemies ? None but Christ, who was like us in eveything else but not in sin. Think over the sublime dignity of Christ's reply before such snarling enemies. He says nothing to the insulting name of Samaritan, not wishing even to seem to share the general view of that people. There were some good Samaritans among His friends . . . The sublimity of Christ's reply is indeed wonderful. That He should speak with such simplicity and dignity of His intimacy with His Father, of the rewards that He gave, while all around faces were distorted by hate, and venom blackened their souls against Him. Such a context heightens the majesty of His words and make them seem even more wonderful than the discourse to the Samaritan woman or even than the words at the Last Supper. Here in the temple courts His sublimity and dignity are affirmed in the teeth of a blaspheming and vindictive circle of enemies (56). Abraham eagerly desired to see the reign of the Messiah (57). The Jews cannot believe, so blinded are their hearts, what Christ has made quite plain, that the life He is speaking of and which He can give as a reward is not a life in time. They think He must be claiming to be a contemporary of Abraham's. Fifty is just a round figure ; that was the most Christ could be. According to that figure, too, Christ was not even an old man (58). The verbs made clear the difference. The allusion to Exodus III. 13-14 ("I who am sent thee ") doesn't escape them and instead of falling on their knees before their God, they rush for stones to crush the mouth that spoke such words, at the sound of which the grass might have shrivelled in the fields and the birds fallen from the trees. Either Christ made Himself invisible as He had done at Nazareth (Luke IV. 30), or escaped in a natural manner by mingling with the crowd. Hatred of Truth : Many people are amazed at the opposition and the blasphemy which Christ's mission provoked. They can never understand such a situation as the one we meditate on to-day, where men who professed to be lovers of truth and worshippers of the true God ring around the Teacher of Truth like mad dogs who would tear Him limb from limb. There are lessons for all of us in this incident, apart from the loving admiration of Christ's forbearance, His dignity and nobility. Here are some points : Notice the words of Christ : " It is because you do not belong to God that you will not listen to Me " (V. Evil living makes men unable to see and love the truth (see John III. 20). Their minds are clouded by passion and self-interest. Not only this but men can come to hate the truth (Jo. III. 20) and we see this illustrated not only by such incidents as to-day's gospel records, but in the history of the Church and daily experience. Here is one of the 47</page><page sequence="9">The Furrow deep causes of the persecution of the Church. The very sight of truth, of men and institutions that maintain its principles becomes odious and a reproof. Yet all men profess a great love for truth. No man could refuse his adherence and love to its principles, considered in its fine and noble maxims. But when it is applied and put before us, when it opens our eyes to our faults, when it rebukes the unchaste, the unjust, the proud?then men forget its beauty and long to destroy this disturber of their peace. Conscience is the lamp which reveals the truth. Yet how often do men obscure this light by evasion, self-deceit, excuses. ' ' If the light which is in thee is itself darkness, what of the darkness ? " (Matt. VI. 22). We find a hundred subtle reasons to excuse us from the clear precepts of the gospel. Interest and passion make for us a new gospel, one that Jesus Christ never knew. Instead of the vigorous maxims of Christianity we substitute a monstrous mixture of Christ and the world. Could Christ confront us this Passion Sunday exactly as He did the Jews ? Impossible ? But that is exactly what the Jews would have said. We must this Passiontide, so laden with grace, prepare ourselves most con scientiously for our Easter confession, lay no flattering unction to our soul. It is not yet night, there is still light to see our sins in their true colour and confess them to His minister. PALM SUND A Y. Matt. XXI. 1-9; (Mark XL 1-10 ; Luke XIX. 28-44 ; John XII. 12-19). Jesus had spent the Sabbath i.e. Saturday, before the Crucifixion with His friends Martha, Mary and Lazarus at Bethany, just outside Jerusalem. On Sunday morning He makes His entry as Messias into His City. Approp riately it was the 10th day of Nisan, the day for choosing the Paschal lamb. Christ who had refused in Galilee to be acclaimed a King and avoided causing sensations that might have led to some attempted coup, now with great deliberation and in fulfilment of prophecy rides into Jerusalem. He accepts the acclamations and plaudits of the thousands that thronged the city for the pasch. The time is late afternoon (Mk. XI. 11). The foreknowledge shown in the detailed account of the finding of the man with the ass and colt is clearly miraculous. St. Matthew likes to bring out in his gospel these details that show the Messiah to be the fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecies. This one is from Zachary IX. 9, and the reference is not to two asses, but to one that has not yet borne the yoke. It was a custom in the East to select such a beast for a grand occasion of this sort. The sensation over the recent raising of Lazarus from the dead attracted great numbers (John XII. 12-19). ' Hosanna ' would be equivalent to ' Viva ' or ' Hurrah for.' ' Son of Divid ' was the best known title of the Messiah. There was nothing humiliating, in Jewish eyes, in the Messias' riding an ass. St. John Chrysostom, however, comments, ' ' He came driving no chariots, parading no tributes, like other kings, inspiring no terror, leading about no satellites, but here, too, revealing great modesty . . . For what king ever rode into Jerusalem on an ass ? " Here are some other comments of St. John Chrysostom on this gospel : Of the finding of the man with the ass : "It was no small condemnation of the Jews that He could persuade men who never laid eyes on Him, and 48</page><page sequence="10">Notes on the Sunday Gospels never knew Him to give up to Him their property, while the Jews who saw Him perform miracles through His disciples, contradicted Him to His face." Of the colt : ' ' Consider the gentleness of the colt. Though he was unbroken and never knew bridle, yet he did not behave in an unmannerly way, but went quietly. This was a prophecy of future happenings, symbolising the docile nations and the changed Gentile world. For that word can accom plish everything? ' Loose them and bring them to Me ' ; disordered things are restored to order, the unclean became clean." Christ a King : With the greatest deliberation and such elevated dignity as king never showed, Christ rides into His own city. He had visited it often before incog nito ; now He comes as Son of David with Hosannas and palms. Every inch a King, but without the pride and terror and cruelty with which triumphant kings surrounded their chariots. " He comes to you meek " (Zachary IX). All nature salutes Him, the unbroken colt, the branches from the trees, the children in the streets, who could not be silenced? ' ' if they should keep silence, the stones would cry out instead" (Luke XIX. 40). "The whole world," the Pharisees said, ' ' has turned aside to follow Him " (John XII. 19). Frequently during His life Christ has avoided demonstrations intended to acclaim Him as King?of the kind the Jews wished for. He would select His own times and ways ; He was not to be brought to His throne by circum stance. He is master of His life and He lays it down freely. Now at the threshold of His Passion, He wishes to reveal Himself openly to all, so that afterwards all will remember His Kingliness and His claim. We are shocked to remember that the City which acclaimed Christ with Hosannas, six days later clamoured for His blood, and we are excited to a kind of pity for Christ as the victim of such a cruel and fickle monster. But Christ was not the victim of that?" no one taketh away from Me My life." ' ' Thou sayest I am King." We cannot imagine Him radiant, His face alight at the reception of the crowd, enthusiastically returning their salutes like a pohtican from his balcony, the world at his feet . . . He knew, He saw what lay before, and the awful irony of that day was bitter agony to Him. We must acknowledge Christ as King of our hearts and minds. So many, Catholics even, protest their loyalty with hollow words. They will do everything for Christ, provided they can make Him a King of their own kind, one who does not disturb their sinful ways, one who makes no harsh demands. But a King with a Cross . . . Before the great days of Holy Week each one should ask himself in utter sincerity, what sacrifice he should bring to Christ's triumph. The days are days rich in grace. 49</page></plain_text>
