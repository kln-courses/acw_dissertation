<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> On Robots and Turtles: A Posthuman  Perspective on Camera and Image  Movement after Michael Snow’s  La région centrale Florian Leitner Prologue: A Lost and Found Camera On May 16, 2010, a Florida Coast Guard officer by the name of  Paul Schultz found a digital photo camera on the beach. It had  been washed ashore on Key West and was protected by a case made  of acrylic glass, designed for underwater use. Schultz took the cam- era home and downloaded the photos from its memory on his  computer. As they largely contained ordinary snapshots, depicting  scenes from everyday family life and holiday activities, they did not  give away any information about the owner of the device. Schultz  therefore published them on several Internet sites that are dedi- cated to tourism and diving,1 hoping that someone else might find  any clues. Indeed, a visitor of one of the sites recognized the chil- dren in some of the pictures. Shortly after, Dick de Bruin, the chil- dren’s father, received a parcel with his fully functioning camera  and its waterproof case. The Dutch naval officer was stationed in  Aruba, an island of the Lesser Antilles in the southern Caribbean.   Discourse, 35.2, Spring 2013, pp. 263–277.

Traveling from the  Antilles to Florida through two oceans, the device had covered a  distance of more than eleven hundred miles. This remarkable anecdote is a story about moving images and  moving with images, about photographs traveling from coastal  South America to North America and back—or, to be precise,  about a camera traveling with the photographs stored in its mem- ory. Beyond that, another form of image movement comes into  play because of the intervention of a sea turtle. The marine reptile  appears to have used the traveling camera to shoot a short film,  which Schultz found on the memory card among de Bruin’s pic- tures. The clip in question had been recorded, as the metadata  of the file indicated, on January 15, 2010, during the camera’s sea  voyage, long after it had been lost by its owner. As Schultz reckoned, the camera must have been floating  somewhere off the coast of Honduras that day, and this is where the  sea turtle approached it. Probably the animal mistook the device  for food and snatched at it. In any case, the turtle hit the release  button. And because the camera had been set to video mode by de  Bruin before disappearing into the ocean, it started filming. The  clip that the camera recorded shows how the turtle plays around  with it, banging against it, snapping at it, and keeping it in constant  motion. The images that were captured in the process are rather  shaky, as the camera is incessantly performing hectic tilts and pans.  In one moment the lens is directed toward the clear blue sky, while  in the next second it turns to show the Caribbean underwater  world. Only occasionally the turtle itself can be seen—until, after  five minutes, it loses interest and swims away. The video contin- ues for another fifteen uneventful minutes before the battery goes  dead, with the lens headed toward the sky, washed over by seawater  from time to time. Schultz edited out the ending and put the rest of the film on  YouTube. Uploaded on May 28, 2010, under the title “Sea Turtle  Finds Lost Camera,” the clip generated nearly 2.7 million clicks and  was commented on as of February 2014 more than 3,500 times.2 Introduction: Cats, Pigeons, and Turtles Images in general and photographic images in particular are  and have always been more than just products of human inten- tion. Nonhuman actors may play a crucial role in their produc- tion as well. A striking example is provided not only recently by the  </page> <page sequence="3"> On Robots and Turtles 265 directorial debut of the sea turtle but even much earlier by carrier  pigeons, which since 1906 were used by Julius Neubronner to take  aerial photographs. The German pharmacist developed cameras  with a lightweight self-timer and attached them to the birds before  he let them loose. When they returned home, the devices would  contain pictures that had been taken during flight.3 Neubronner  sold the equipment he had invented to pigeon breeders and ama- teur photographers, and his small enterprise can thus be consid- ered a predecessor of projects such as Mr. Lee’s CatCam, a digital  camera specifically designed to be worn by cats and to record while  they are strolling about.4 Of course, the nonhuman actors involved in the production  of (film) images may be nonorganic as well. All kinds of optical  recording equipment fall under this category, as do devices such  as the robotic arm that was used to shoot Michael Snow’s famous  La région centrale. In fact, there are—although unnoticed by the  YouTube community—astonishing similarities between the sea tur- tle’s film and Snow’s experimental cinema classic, particularly in  respect to the camera movement: both the turtle and the robotic  arm put the camera into a seemingly chaotic rotation around itself  that never stops. I would like to take these similarities as a starting point and  stress how the two films disassociate human gesture and camera  gaze to establish a nonanthropomorphic way of looking—in which  looking and moving become inseparable. Based on this, an analysis  of the quite different conditions under which the two films were  shot is going to reveal that there is in particular one aspect that  sets the sea turtle’s film apart from both La région centrale and Neu- bronner’s and Mr. Lee’s animal photographs: in this case there was  no human being who intentionally initiated the chain of events  that finally lead to the emergence of the film images. They are the  outcome of a cooperation of human, animal, and technical actors  that was purely accidental. Hence, the sea turtle’s film amounts to  a deconstruction of the boundary between human and nonhuman  and of traditional notions about subjectivity and agency. This is also  why “the sea turtle’s film” is a handy but inaccurate expression.  There is no creator subject here, only a dispersed and hybrid actor  network, transcending nations and species, in which meaning is no  longer controlled by an individual and becomes fluid. The turtle’s  film therefore provides a paradigm for imaging and signification  practices in digital networks, because the motion that drives the  latter can be compared to the one that curbs the actor network that  the sea turtle forms part of and that becomes manifest in the film  clip discovered by Schultz. </page> <page sequence="4"> 266 Florian Leitner Figure 1.

Screen shot from “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera.” </page> <page sequence="5"> On Robots and Turtles 267 A Nonanthropomorphic Way of Looking Around 1970, Canadian filmmaker Michael Snow commissioned  Pierre Abeloos, a creative engineer from Montreal, to build a  robotic arm on which a 16mm film camera could be mounted—“a  machine which would allow the camera to move smoothly about  a number of different axes at various speeds, while supported by  a short column, where the lens of the camera could pass within  inches of the ground and zoom into the infinity of the sky,” as Peter  Rist describes it.5 The device was set up on a lonely mountaintop  in northern Quebec near Sept-Îles. Snow and his team were shoot- ing for five days, producing sixty hours of material that was sub- sequently edited down to the three-hour-long La région centrale,  released in 1971.6 La région centrale shows a mountain landscape, observed  through a camera eye that never changes its location but is con- stantly rotating around itself. Thanks to the robotic arm, the cam- era is able to turn in any possible direction, performing horizontal,  vertical, lateral, and even spiral movements. As the perspectives  of the landscape that the film presents become more and more  bizarre, they are more and more disconnected from cinematic con- ventions. In narrative cinema, the camera view is not necessarily  identical with the character’s view; in classical Hollywood cinema,  the camera view only shows the character’s point of view in excep- tional cases. But the camera view almost always imitates the human  gaze in one way or another. This is why the terms commonly used  to classify field sizes (long shot, medium shot, close-up, etc.) and  camera angles (eye-level, high-angle, low-angle) are defined by  their relation to the size of the human body. The anthropomorphic  condition of the camera becomes particularly apparent in its move- ments, such as in pans that appear to be equivalent to the pivoting  of a human head. However, what La région centrale presents are,  as Tom Holert puts it, totally “dehumanized camera movements”7  that, according to Rist, “heretofore could not possibly be observed  by the human eye.”8 As indicated earlier, the camera in “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Cam- era,” with its constant, seemingly chaotic rotation around itself, fol- lows the same aesthetic principle as in La région centrale: the space  that surrounds the camera eye is explored seamlessly in all three  dimensions and from every possible perspective. Human eyes,  trapped in their anatomic sockets, could never perform anything  like this. The marine reptile directs a remake of La région centrale,  unchaining the camera and making the spectators’ heads spin.  The sea turtle even creates an ending reminiscent of Snow when it  </page> <page sequence="6"> 268 Florian Leitner finally swims away and leaves the camera, still running, behind. As  a result the turtle’s recording ends, just like Snow’s film, with a few  minutes in which the frantic motion has stopped and the image  shows nothing but the plain sky. La région centrale and “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera” take  the next step within the historical development of media that is  implied by Vilém Flusser: whereas technical media, such as pho- tography, is defined by Flusser as having largely disassociated the  production of images from the human gesture, the two films are  disassociating human gesture and camera gaze.9 The films are still  directed at the visual perception of humans, but what they pres- ent is a nonanthropomorphic way of looking, a glimpse of a com- pletely other gaze whose movements follow an alien choreography,  meandering between sky and ground (in Snow’s film) or sea (in  the turtle’s film). In a 1969 proposal to the Canadian Film Devel- opment Corporation, Snow wrote that the film he was planning  to make “will feel like a record of the last wilderness on earth, a  film to be taken into outer space as a souvenir of what nature once  was”—the kind of images that extraterrestrials who are exploring  Earth would report back home.10 A major reason why these images  appear so outlandish is that looking and moving seem to be so  closely intertwined that they become inseparable. This is also true  for the sea turtle’s film: in both films, the hectic rotation of the  camera evokes the impression that, once the movement stops, the  gaze will correspondingly cease. In fact, the final minutes of both  films can be interpreted this way: after the camera has stopped  turning around itself, it still shows something (the sky), but the  image that it produces is almost void of any content and appears  more like a nonimage. Moving amounts to looking, and stillness  amounts to blindness—with the latter being avoided by Schultz’s  editing out of the last fifteen minutes of the sea turtle clip and their  relative stillness. From Solid to Fluid Although motion and gaze become synonyms in both films and  merge into a motion gaze, the emergence of the latter is based on  different paradigms in La région centrale and “Sea Turtle Finds Lost  Camera.” A comparison of the different environments in which the  two films are set suggests that these paradigms can be described  by the term “solid” on the one hand and by the term “fluid” on  the other. The locations where Snow’s and the turtle’s cameras are  shooting share the same basic characteristic: they are void of any  </page> <page sequence="7"> On Robots and Turtles 269 signs of human civilization and almost void of any other signs of  life, apart from the scant vegetation on Snow’s mountains and a  few little fish that swim by in front of the turtle’s lens. Nevertheless,  by replacing the rugged Canadian mountains with the crystal clear  and cloudless Caribbean, the sea turtle’s film makes a significant  alteration—acting almost like an intentional remake that proves its  artistic ambition by not just copying the original but also varying  it. The change of location not only allows for a brighter and more  color-saturated image but also introduces a crucial opposition: as  the sea supersedes the rocky crest, one element is substituted by  another, earth by water, solid by fluid. The substitution can be read  as reflecting a paradigm shift that concerns the way images emerge  and signification is produced. On the one hand, there is the para- digm represented by La région centrale. It is based on a strategy of  meaning making whose solidity relies on a distinct origin in the  shape of a human creator subject who remains in complete con- trol of all processes of signification. The sea turtle’s film, however,  establishes a different paradigm in which signification becomes  fluid, as it is no longer controlled by a single subject. It is the soundtrack of “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera” that  indicates the impossibility of identifying an individual creator. The  film is accompanied by the lapping of the ocean and the noises  of the turtle hitting the acrylic case, as they were recorded by the  microphone installed on the camera. They are constantly remind- ing us of the copresence of the reptile and the sea, of the ongo- ing interaction between them, and of the absence of a single—let  alone human—subject to which these movements could be attrib- uted. Thus, we are also reminded that the resulting images and the  meaning that can be inscribed in them have to be conceived of as  just as intangible and fluid as the ocean in which turtle and camera  are floating. At first glance, La région centrale appears to be a work in which  control over the footage is renounced in a similar way. In this case,  the soundtrack consists of mechanical blips and electronic noises,  machine-made signals produced by the unit controlling the robotic  arm. They attest that the director has completely devolved the cam- era action unto the apparatus, that the images are machine-made  as well. However, although in La région centrale, as Holert explains,  “the ‘human factor’ is limited to constructing the machine, pro- gramming it, choosing the location, and deciding how to edit the  film from sixty to three hours,” the programming part remains the  decisive aspect.11 As chaotic as they may seem, the camera move- ments are entirely predetermined so that the robotic arm never  moves in exactly the same way twice, and each movement is slightly  </page> <page sequence="8"> 270 Florian Leitner different. Therefore, the director, supported by his programmer,  remains within a humanistic mode of signification, acting as an  autonomous creator subject. The contrast of “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera” and La région  centrale—in respect to the tight control regime from which the lat- ter’s images emerge—appears to be even stronger once we con- sider not only that the camera movements in the turtle’s film are  random but that the film as such is an accidental product. The  sheer fact that the camera was recording at all was due to a coin- cidental chain of events, just like its sea voyage. The turtle’s film  can be seen as an aesthetic object, but it does not stand in the  humanistic tradition of the aesthetics of European Enlightenment,  which conceives of artistic expression and meaning as emerging  from the intentional actions of an individual and which Snow still  forms part of, despite his use of robotics and nonanthropomorphic  ways of looking. The sea turtle’s film is not the result of meticulous  planning by a human creator subject. Eventually it originates from  a lapse, from someone losing his camera while going for a dive— someone, unlike Snow, losing control. A lapse, instead of an intentional artistic gesture, eventually  produces something that becomes readable as an aesthetic object.  This renunciation of traditional aesthetics is only possible because  of a hybrid network that transgresses nationalities, species, and the  divides between organic and nonorganic and between nature and  technology. The network consists of a camera and a waterproof  case, a sloppy diver, the currents in the Caribbean and the Gulf  of Mexico, a sea animal, an altruistic Coast Guard officer, and a  global online community. All of them can be described as actors in  the sense of actor-network theory (ANT). Bruno Latour explains:  “An ‘actor’ in the hyphenated expression actor-network is not the  source of an action but the moving target of a vast array of entities  swarming toward it. . . . To use the word ‘actor’ means that it’s never  clear who and what is acting when we act.”12 Conceiving of the col- laboration from which the turtle’s film emerged in this way conveys  a worldview characteristic of ANT, which according to Latour “pic- tures a world made of concatenations of mediators where each point  can be said to fully act.”13 Examining this world, we cannot “deduce  from a few causes as many of the effects that were there ‘in poten- tia,’” but we have “to replace as many causes as possible by a series  of actors.”14 It is significant that in the example of the sea turtle’s  film, this renunciation of monocausality is adjunct to a situation in  which humans and fellow animals truly become—by contributing  to the joint production of a remake of a well-known work of art— “companion species,” in Donna Haraway’s sense.15 </page> <page sequence="9"> On Robots and Turtles 271 Most of the actors within the network that is behind “Sea Tur- tle Finds Lost Camera” are unknown to each other. The relation  between them is established at first by the ocean and then by the  Internet, media that can be described—drawing on the shift from  solid to fluid performed by the turtle’s film—as fluid inasmuch as  they constitute complex systems, and trying to get hold of whoever  or whatever determines the behavior of these systems is pointless;  there is constantly something slipping through our fingers. This  is because the underlying material is formless,16 a property that  not only applies to water but also to data, as Alexander Galloway  recently pointed out in connection with attempts to draw maps of  the Internet.17 Whereas the ocean allowed for the emergence of the images  in “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera,” it is mainly the Internet that  produces the aesthetic meaning that we can find in them. Without  the Internet, Schultz would have never been able to trace back the  chain of events that led to the shaky video he discovered on the  lost and found camera. Consequently, we would hardly be able to  interpret the video as an aesthetic object in the way that it now  appears to us. The circumstances of its emergence would remain  obscure, and therefore the shift from solid to fluid that it performs  in comparison to La région centrale could probably not be identified  in its full relevance. We would not be able to realize that the turtle’s  film not only can be seen as an adaptation of Snow’s film but also  establishes fluidity as a metaphor for the circumstances of its own  emergence and for the underlying model of image production and  signification. In this sense, “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera” is a truly digital  piece of art, as the Internet is the condition of possibility not only  of its circulation but also of its aesthetic complexity. We might even  think of the turtle’s film as a remediation of Snow’s film under  the fluid conditions of a global digital network. What defines the  fluidity, as I would like to conceive of it, of ocean and Internet in  this context is that they do not assign any of the above-mentioned  actors the role of a creator subject. When we look at La région cen- trale, in contrast, the entities that are eventually responsible for the  actions of the apparatus—the artist (Snow), his collaborators (Abe- loos and others.)—can easily be determined and addressed as solid  structures. In the final chapter of How We Became Posthuman, Katherine  Hayles describes systems whose behavior cannot be traced back  to a single origin. Of course, she does not refer to Snow or other  examples of film footage recorded with the help of robots or ani- mals. But her argument is based on what can be described as a shift  </page> <page sequence="10"> 272 Florian Leitner from solid to fluid as well, or in her words “a shift from presence/ absence to pattern/randomness”: “Rather than proceeding along  a trajectory toward a known end, such systems evolve toward an  open future marked by contingency and unpredictability. Mean- ing is not guaranteed by a coherent origin.”18 It is significant that  Hayles develops this idea by referring to Edwin Hutchins’s analysis  of navigational systems of oceangoing ships.19 She thus relates to  another network for which the sea is one of the connecting media  and in which processes such as cognition and decision making  reside, according to Hayles, “not in humans alone but in the com- plex interactions within an environment that includes both human  and nonhuman actors.”20 Fluidity can be applied as a metaphor to  characterize such interactions and environments, and if we con- cede that “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera” draws on this metaphor,  we encounter a dimension of aesthetic meaning in the film that has  been established independently of any creator subject. In Hayles’s  words, “meaning is not front-loaded into the system, and the origin  does not act to ground signification.”21 As it manifests itself in the motion gaze of “Sea Turtle Finds  Lost Camera,” the fluidity of the underlying network destabilizes  certain binaries that are left untouched by La région centrale. If  the latter is based on a paradigm of solidity, this is also true inas- much as the way it intertwines motion and gaze eventually asserts  oppositions such as human versus nonhuman and technical ver- sus natural. Snow’s film does not question if these dichotomies are  really as solid as they seem to be. On the one hand, this is because  when La région centrale establishes what Holert calls “a purely  technical kind of viewing,”22 it defines its aesthetics by excluding  natural kinds of viewing—whatever these may look like. On the  other hand, its nonanthropomorphic gaze is defined ex negativo  by excluding the human gaze that is presumably embodied in the  anthropomorphic camera known from narrative cinema. The sea  turtle’s film, however, eventually deconstructs the divide between  human and nonhuman and between technical and natural. Its  camera perspectives may be characterized by their nonanthro- pomorphic condition as well, but if we ask what kind of viewing  it establishes, we have to consider the fluid network behind it.  And what we encounter there, beyond the human (gaze), is not  the nonhuman (gaze) but a hybrid configuration of human and  animal, technical and natural actors—and the motion gaze they  create collaboratively. The way of looking—the motion gaze—presented in “Sea Tur- tle Finds Lost Camera” therefore signals a nonanthropocentric,  posthuman perspective. This perspective ultimately undermines  </page> <page sequence="11"> On Robots and Turtles 273 the traditional idea that subjectivity and agency can be located at  a single point, within the inner core of a self that is inaccessible  from the outside. Thomas Nagel sums up this idea in his claim  that “every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with  a single point of view” and that subjectivity can be understood  as the embodiment of such a point of view.23 Speculating about  nonhuman subjectivity, he concludes that “the subjective charac- ter of experience is fully comprehensible only from one point of  view.”24 It is this approach that becomes manifest in Snow’s film,  which literally revolves around a single point of view. La région cen- trale may counteract human subjectivity, but it is based on a notion  of nonhuman subjectivity that is consistent with Nagel’s concept.  After all, Snow’s film stages a point of view that is at the same time  an inaccessible origin: the title refers not only to the name of the  geographic region where the robotic arm was mounted but also to  the only point in space that never appears onscreen, although the  machine eye explores all possible perspectives of the environment  surrounding it. Without the help of mirrors, the camera cannot  become visible on the footage it records. The central region is the  camera itself. When Pooja Rangan writes about “handing over the media  apparatus” to nonhumans, she argues that such practices can  engender interactions that destabilize a traditional view of the sub- ject, but only “if we let go of the rhetorical tropes that . . . represent  ‘agency.’”25 This is precisely what becomes apparent when compar- ing La région centrale and “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera.” Whereas  Snow’s film—still based on the rhetoric of (aesthetic) agency— does nothing more than substituting nonhuman for human sub- jectivity, the turtle’s film dismisses subjectivity as such and transfers  aesthetic agency from a human creator subject into a hybrid, dis- persed actor network. Moving in the Global Image Scenario The posthuman perspective of the turtle’s film can be interrelated  with certain visual practices in digital networks in general. To this  end, we need to consider the different forms of image movement  that are associated with it. Besides the movement of the camera  eye—which can be observed onscreen, as it is closely intertwined  with the act of looking—there is another kind of movement that  is crucial here: the movement of images through geographic  space, the motion that made the pictures taken by de Bruin and  those taken by the sea turtle appear on Schultz’s computer and  </page> <page sequence="12"> 274 Florian Leitner subsequently on our computers. This movement behind “Sea Tur- tle Finds Lost Camera” is produced by the same actor network as  the onscreen movement, whose operations are governed by a para- digm of fluidity. We are thus afforded in the turtle’s film a specific  form of aesthetic experience that is characteristic of image prac- tices in digital networks and is based on a posthuman perspective. In fact, it seems that the success of “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Cam- era” on YouTube has more to do with the movement of the images  in geographic space than with the motion that can be observed  onscreen. This becomes clear when reading the comments. If one  watches the clip without Snow’s work in mind, it is not much more  than a rather pointless succession of film images in varying shades  of blue. The lack of fixed points that could serve as an anchor for  the composition of the image—the fluidity of the footage—is even  more disorienting than what Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna  Paravel presented in the film Leviathan (2012), documenting high- sea fishing by placing small cameras in unusual places such as in  fishing nets or on the sides of boats. A lot of commenters on You- Tube complained that the sea turtle’s video made them “dizzy” and  “seasick.” But there are also many commenters who were enthu- siastic about it: “amazing,” “so cute,” and “awesome story” are  remarks that were posted numerous times. Feeling dizzy is clearly  an effect of the motion gaze that becomes visible in the images.  What appears to be crucial for the positive reactions to the sea tur- tle’s film, however, is the motion that made the camera travel from  coastal South America to North America and back. Just like the  motion gaze, this movement was generated by the extremely com- plex and hybrid system that is responsible for the emergence of the  film images in the first place and for their dissemination all over  the planet via the Internet. In other words, the fascination caused  by “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera” is induced not by the movement  of the images on the screen but instead by the movement that these  images have performed in order to appear there. The same thing is probably true for the photos that Schultz  published online when he was looking for the owner of the cam- era. Even after Schultz located the owner, we still look at these pic- tures with fascination and are less concerned with their content  than with the spectacular sea voyage they bear witness to. They  thrill us because of the intercontinental movement they have per- formed and because they enact the unlikely event of a message in  a bottle finding a recipient and being returned. This special way of  being affected by images appears to be a phenomenon that is char- acteristic for certain visual practices that have become dominant  in the digital era. The images that are disseminated nowadays via  </page> <page sequence="13"> On Robots and Turtles 275 the Internet arouse our interest because of a movement that does  not take place onscreen, as many of them are still images—it is the  movement they perform when traveling through the global net- work that fascinates us. This is, of course, even more of an illusion  than the perceived motion of film images, because in fact nothing  is being moved—there is only a transmittal of information. Never- theless, the images that are exchanged on platforms such as Face- book seem to form part of an aesthetic practice that conceives of  them not primarily as representational objects in their own right  but as components of a system whose autopoiesis is perpetuated  through a constant transmitting and receiving of digital images.  More often than not, looking at these images—whether they are  photographs or film clips—provides an experience that is less con- cerned with their representational qualities than with the processes  of dissemination through which they have arrived on the user’s  screen. In this respect, the Eiffel Tower or the southern beach in  the background of my friends’ pictures that I encounter via social  media is much more decisive than their faces. The landmarks do  not serve, however, as indexical signs of geographic places. They  can instead be seen as markers, tagging the movement that the  images have performed. Even if the latter are still images, they are  perceived as moving inasmuch as they form part of what Flusser  calls a “global image scenario,”26 a continual worldwide movement  of visual representations. In the era of the Internet, the “global image scenario” emerges  from a de-individualized, decentralized, and highly complex struc- ture that is comparable to the one behind “Sea Turtle Finds Lost  Camera”: both consist of human and nonhuman as well as techni- cal and nontechnical elements that perform nonintentional acts  and are synchronized through digital networks and/or oceans,  through global fluid media. Both generate a movement of images  that cannot be traced back to a definite origin, to a single sub- ject, to an agency that is located at a specific point. We are dealing  with a “distributed agency” as it could be called, applying a concept  developed by Werner Rammert and Ingo Schulz-Schaeffer.27 And  in both cases the movement allows for a specific aesthetic experi- ence. In the case of “Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera,” this experi- ence is emblematic inasmuch as the two forms of image movement  that are associated with the film—the movement within the images  and the movement performed by the images traveling from coastal  South America to North America and back—may be different in  terms of their perceptual status, but they enact the same posthu- man perspective. What they eventually make palpable is a para- digm of fluidity that underlies the global digital network. </page> <page sequence="14"> 276 Florian Leitner Notes 1.
