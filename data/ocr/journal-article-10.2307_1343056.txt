<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Recognition and Identification of Objects in Paintings Mark Roskill Introduction There are certain ways in which the spectator's response to a work of art is liable to interference or a potentially deflecting kind of persuasion. What one is told is there in the work, or relevant in it, may play such a role; and so may what one supposes to be there, as opposed to what actually is. Since similar problems apply in the perception of the real world, including the people and the actions in it, to say this is not yet to say that there is, or should be, a pure and untrammeled kind of percep- tion that one aims at or learns to use in front of works of art; that being already a form of critical theorizing which places some kind of limits or ideal construction on what is permissible in the form of a response. But to stop short of such a step is also to leave open the question of whether there are in fact two distinct realms in which perception and related cognitive processes occur, one artistic, the other nonartistic. For present purposes, rather than any larger presupposition being entertained here, it is assumed simply that, differences of situation and context notwith- standing, there is no type of statement concerning the perception of a work of art which does not have a parallel or equivalent in the percep- tion of the real world. Such is the philosophical basis for the line of inquiry to be followed here. In the case of modern art, the question of the artist's authority in regard to what he has done, and the kinds of possible evidence that may substantiate what is said or observed about a work, are intrinsically likely to take on an increased importance because of the absence or reduction of recognizable imagery. The topic of recognition and identification places itself, from this point of view, alongside the issue generally known 677</page><page sequence="2">678 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification as that of the artist's intentions. But while the latter has been the subject of continuous and sustained debate, both as it applies to literature and in a more broadly philosophical sense, the issue to be taken up here has scarcely been written about at all. Narrowed so as to deal only with paintings, it may indeed have the look of being widely different in sub- stance. But the two topics are in fact joined, or at least linked in the broad sense indicated, raising as they both do questions pertaining to knowledge and how it is come by, and detaching themselves on that basis into a series of comparable sub-issues; and in the context of the present writer's concerns, they bear in parallel on the interpretation of that most difficult modern art form, cubism, in ways brought out here by one particular choice of example and an appendix. On the Workings of Imagination and Suggestion The use of imagination and the response to suggestion clearly play an important part in the reading of works of art. But the way in which this happens forms, generally speaking, a self-contained subject of in- quiry, which is germane for present purposes only insofar as lines of separation need to be drawn. In the drawing of those lines, a key consid- eration that needs to be recognized is that not all identification or recog- nition, of whatever kind, involves interpretation as a necessary part of it. The notion that this should be so takes its force from the longstand- ing premise, in the philosophy of perception, that there is a sense-datum provided by the object of perception and also, separately or following that, by what the perceiver does with it. But though description of what is seen does indeed in some instances shade into interpretation, no such generalized assumption as to what takes place in the process of percep- tion can be made to rest on those cases. In the most often debated examples in philosophy, of the stick half submerged in the water and looking as if it were bent, and the round penny which appears elliptical from a certain angle and viewpoint, the stick is recognized or identified as being a straight one, not actually bent by the water but appearing to be, and the penny as being really round, with again an appended state- ment of why it should look as if it were not. What is seen may in these examples be interpreted, in the sense of an explanation being given; but Mark Roskill is currently preparing a book-length interpretation of cubism, from which the present essay has been adapted. The author of Van Gogh, Gauguin and the Impressionist Circle, What is Art History? and a forthcoming book on photography, he teaches courses in the history of modern art and in critical theory at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 679 this is not to say that the stick as one sees it is being interpreted as a bent version, or image, of a straight stick. In the case of a map of the world, it is one thing, where the map is modern, to find or recognize America from its shape; it is quite another, where the map is old or one with a strange projection, to interpret a shape, which is perhaps unrecognizable, as America. And though the recognition of an acquaintance by recall might suggest a memory image which is held in the mind and is conjured up for consultation and comparison, the extreme case of matching, in which cups patterned in varying ways are drawn from a box and jux- taposed in turn to the one for which a pair is being sought, is one in which, revealingly, the pattern is recognized each time as being or not being the same one; there is no interpretation to that effect, and cer- tainly no imagination is involved in the sense of a mental picture that is referred to. From this group of examples, therefore, interpretation appears as a varyingly inductive or deductive process, but as one probably detached from the perception itself, which may quite possibly be imaginative in character. Recognition and identification, on the other hand, do not necessarily entail a picture or image held in the mind, which is used in a step or process separate from the perception. The concept of "seeing as," which needs to be taken up also for present purposes, has been much discussed in the philosophy of perception. As distinct from the general question of whether all seeing is to be regarded as in some sense seeing as, reasons for the use of the phrase in ordinary life situations could include an uncontrollable propensity or repeated tendency that one finds in oneself, as for example, the inclination to see a certain face as a laughing one, however hard one tries otherwise, or seeing in a series of dreams a person as alive whom one knew or discovered to be dead. The phrase may be used for an interpretation (and one reflecting knowledge and experience) or recognition of a firm kind, as in the case of a doctor pronouncing on symptoms of cholera; but usually it is so used in a context where there is room for difference and where polite- ness may be important, much as with the shift to the subjunctive in French, or where there is an element of mystery or puzzlement, as on a panel show where there is a mystery object to be identified. In front of works of art, there are cases where the use of imagina- tion on the spectator's part is encouraged, allowed or assumed. The language used shows, in the sense that certain distinctive phrases are employed, where this is the case. "I see this as .. ." designates in this context the making of an imaginative construction, as when a sequence of clouds is seen as the different countries of Europe. The phrase com- monly entails the noting of some, but only some, suggestive similarities or resemblances between two dissociated things, as when a mark on a wall or a cloud is seen as a camel, in terms of shape alone. One may also speak of seeing something "in" the work, as for example a certain</page><page sequence="4">680 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification configuration or color; and what it is that a person sees here may very well tell more about the person than about the work. Lastly, the phrase "It looks like so and so to me" may be used, and here both tone and context will be relevant, in addition to the importance of the attached "to me." With the substitution of "sounds" for "looks" and "hear" for "see," and with exceptions made for special cases of so-called program music and the evocations of sounds such as bird-song, all of these types of statement have their equivalents in the case of music. What happens there is indicative in that, while the circumstances and conditions under which music is listened to may encourage fantasy and the giving of free rein to whatever images come into the mind, comments of the kind that are being considered are likely to bear at least some relationship either to what happens in the music at a particular point, or to the kind of formal structure the music has. Correspondingly, the typical functions of this kind of language in front of works of art, perhaps most especially for the novice in the field, would be to convey, in a metaphorical or relatively poetic sense, how a particular element strikes one, as when one speaks of seeing a "dark tunnel" in a piece of sculpture; or alternately as a way of describing the arrangement of forms, as when one says that one is be- ginning to be able to see the work as organized into a triangle. It may also be that, by the extension of the same language, a move towards interpretation takes place: as when the sound of the bugle at a certain point in a piece of music is taken as the morning bugle-call of the village, or, on the analogy of a grouping of tea leaves being seen as a portent, a painting is seen as lonely in character. There is, however, a possible troublesomeness in the fact that state- ments and comments of the kind in question here may sometimes be cast in the barer form "I see. .. ." Again the analogy of music is helpful. To say while listening to a piece of music that one hears bird-song may be a true statement, if one is listening to the Pastoral Symphony; or it may be an interpretative one, on the same general lines as in the case of the bugle-call. But just as a flippancy, gratuitousness of comment or self- projection on the speaker's part may be involved in the statement that "it sounds like bird-song" or "it looks like falling rain to me," so also there is a first-person use of "seeing as" or "seeing" which stresses subjectivity. To illustrate this, one may take the third-person use which allows one to say, of a surrealist double image, that one can see it, simultaneously here, both as a fruit dish and as a face, and compare that use with the first- person use in "I like to see this as .. ." or some such remark as "I see a wood nymph when you enter the room," which is essentially a matter of self-indulgence in a familiar, recognized pleasure in one case and a flight of fancy in the other. Easy as it may be, on such grounds, to be dismissive of a person's saying, in front of a painting, that he sees dark shadows or a piece of coal</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 681 on the end of a stick, consideration of purpose rather than psychology brings up the fact that statements of the form "I see .. ." are commonly used with works of art either to express an extreme broadness or gener- ality of response or to show lack of further interest. Such statements are not then to be taken as either mindless or absurd. In a context of ap- preciation they may appear as misleadingly promising more in the way of perception than they really have to offer, but in informal discussion the qualification to be made is more of their not being to the point, in the sense that either there will be no way of locating more exactly within the work what the comment refers to, or there will really be nothing more to be elicited from the speaker. So understood, these are in either event a special kind of statement. It emerges, therefore, that wfen a person talks about works of art in terms that involve the exercise of imagination, he is not thereby loosen- ing his hold on accuracy or firmness of recognition and identification any more than a person about to die who sees his whole life flash before him. The idea of an opposition between hitting the mark in what is said and just narrowly missing it is misplaced here. Comments on what some- thing in a painting is may be phrased speculatively or cautiously, for whatever reasons, but to speak of what one sees something as in a paint- ing is not normally a loose or less specific version of such phrasing. What one sees as a left arm or as part of the background may in fact be that, as with the puddle that looks like gasoline rather than water; but the phras- ing most often distinguishes the two types of statement from one another, as do also their differing criteria of supportability. How the Identity of an Object May Be Unclear In determining for what reasons the identity of an object may be unclear in a painting that one is dealing with directly, one can properly exclude two types of consideration as irrelevant for present purposes. There are those cases in which special circumstances or conditions may affect one's ability to see or read a painting. Impairments to one's vision that fall under this rubric would include such factors as the fall or amount of light, obstacles in the way, distance, drunkenness or dazzle; impairments to the work would consist especially of physical damage to it, such as a blackened segment. The phrasing most typically used for such cases is that the object "appears to be" a knife or a clockface: it appears to be that in a raking light, from here, or under interfering circumstances which are then detailed or referred to. Also to be left out of account are cases in which a special knowledge or experience that could be brought to bear is lacking or not available: one may not know what a certain object, such as a viola da gamba, is like, or what the X rays of the painting reveal.</page><page sequence="6">682 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification With these exclusions, four kinds of reason are then left. First there will be the liability of the object itself to misreading. It may for example be similar in appearance to something else, as a whole or in one or another respect; and the unfamiliarity of the object could well be a contributing factor here, it being quite often the case that assimilation to a more familiar object may occur. Second, there would be the lack of an assisting context, consisting, for example, of other related objects or an indicative placing of more complete or more detailed renderings of the same object. The effect of hanging a painting upside down or otherwise wrongly may qualify for inclusion under this heading, as a special case, insofar as correction here causes the elements to fall into place contextu- ally, as perhaps with the growth of roses out from a sketchy green background. And third, there will be factors in the structure of the painting which naturally have or tend to have such a consequence: as, for example, overlap, atmospheric dissolution, simplification or change of color. The fourth and final kind of reason, which calls for consideration on its own, may be designated as deliberate ambiguity on the artist's part. "Ambiguity" is used here in the second dictionary sense, of being un- clear and therefore susceptible to alternative interpretations, as opposed to the sense of having more than one meaning. It may be unclear, for example, whether a particular figure is of a boy or a girl; it may be taken either way, or indeed as an androgyne, the degree of specification on the artist's part being insufficient to resolve the matter one way rather than the other. "Deliberate" is used here in contradistinction to accidental; as, for instance, in dealing with a typed or printed version of a poem one might have doubts as to whether a particular misspelling, or an unusual word order, was or was not deliberate. The inclusion of this adjective here lays stress on the ambiguity being an intrinsic part of the artist's style or conception. In that regard, the kind of "naive" ambiguity that is found in the art of children or in so-called primitive art-where what is shown may be simply wrong, in terms for example of how the head joins onto the neck, or the specification insufficient for the purpose in ques- tion, as for instance to identify a man as dead-is still deliberate in the sense that recognizable conventions are adopted, as in early Greek vase painting. The four factors which have now been reviewed group themselves in a sequence, or spectrum, which goes by gradual shift from the nature of the object to the artist's treatment of it. It is against that latter end of the spectrum that comments of a derisive or indignant kind align them- selves, asking where something is in a painting or claiming rhetorically a failure to make out anything. When, correspondingly, a hostile critic makes a similarly directed remark such as asking, in a well-known in- stance, how Monet's "innumerable black tongue lickings" could repre- sent figures on a boulevard, it is doubtful if either change of viewing</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 683 distance or further consideration of the nature of the subject would make any effective difference to the tenor and tone of what is said. On the Resolution ofDifficulties and Hesitations Difficulties and hesitations experienced in front of a work of art, for the reasons now given, as to what an object is, may be resolved in a number of different ways which bring out more generally the bases and criteria for doing this. The object or objects themselves may serve this purpose, as, for example, the actual instruments kept by the artist in his studio. So may other works by the artist, which show the same object or include a similar treatment of it. In both of these cases special knowledge to which one may have access is at issue. Then there are the available records of the creative process leading up to the work: drawings, studies, photographs or pattern books that the artist knew or consulted, or pos- sibly the paint on the studio floor. There is the title given by the artist to be considered as something attached to the work. And lastly there is the possibility of the spectator's presence during the creative process and his viewing of it. Excluded here is the righting of the way the work is framed or hung, since, except in the special kind of case already considered, what is eliminated here represents, or is akin to, an impediment to the spectator's viewing; especially in the case of a frame, which may, for example, have overlapped and therefore obstructed part of the work. It is then clear that, with the objects themselves and other works of the artist's, one is dealing with factors which are definitely external to the work of art, as a self-contained entity; and the same would arguably be true of the records of the creative process. In the remaining two cases, whether one regards the title given by the artist and the process of execution as external or internal is itself a critical or aesthetic judgment, as to where limits should be put on the traditionally maintained au- tonomy of the work of art. That autonomy has been variously conceived of as entailing the work's separation from functional interaction with the real world, as when a spoon is placed in a museum case; or the separa- tion of the work from a context affecting it physically, as when it is taken off the paint-marked studio wall and placed in a frame for display; or again in terms of the work's independence of the process which pro- duced it, including preliminary versions and related works. In further extension of the argument, cases might also be cited in modern art, such as Klee's titling and Duchamp's ready-mades, where the tendency has been to take a positive, inclusive attitude. While the concern in these remarks has been with objects in paint- ings, it is fairly self-evident that the same points and criteria apply to the recognition of people in paintings, and in photographs also. Notions of a</page><page sequence="8">684 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification "primary" basis of recognition enabling one to say that a figure is a man, before the sophistication of special knowledge as to who he is comes in, cannot be justified empirically because though what happens may quite well and commonly proceed in such a way, the criteria of resolution are thereby ranked into an ascending order of what they contribute concep- tually, instead of being recognized as coequal possibilities. The Question of Authority in Resolving Difficulties In terms of the way arguments are settled and doubts are resolved or remain unresolvable, the objects in works of art are not in a unique and special category as compared to objects in real life. The nonpredic- tivity of statements about works of art-which means that, in a case of doubt or dispute as to what something is, there can be no recourse to an action, like the opening up of a box or a fish, in order to settle the matter-makes no actual difference here. The reading of shapes into clouds represents one instance only, but a particularly clear one, of an everyday activity which is analogously divorced from the possibility of action; and a final agreement that one is dealing with a cross between two objects, or two breeds of animal, is as possible an outcome in real life as it is in front of a painting. The situation, in the latter case, of not being able to know or settle such a point as the color of a man's eyes is, if it is to be differentiated from a comparable situation in historical research or necrology, unparalleled there only in respect to the artist's choice as to what is relevant. Knowledge and experience are indeed relevant to resolving difficulties in front of works of art, but the particular manner in which this happens needs stricter specification. For present purposes, special knowledge and experience, as, for example, of what X rays reveal or of the artist's interests, have previously been excluded. As distinct from their contribution, commonly phrased in terms of "it seems to be" or "must be," there is the knowledge or experience to be considered which is gained on the way to making an identification, as part of the process, or used to verify, support or confirm an identification. In illustration of what this means, one may go through a catalogue of paintings looking for a certain object, such as a particular kind of jug or rug, for the purpose of possibly identifying the same object elsewhere, as against using for that purpose knowledge that one already has about jugs or rugs of the time. Or one may think that it could be a rug and proceed on the same basis, thereby ascertaining that it is one. The authority of the artist enters in here through his being a sup- plier or potential supplier of evidence. In normal circumstances evi- dence of such a kind, if available as in the form of memoirs, is likely to be found acceptable; or at the least there will be a feeling of obligation to</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 685 take it into account. The tendency to assume, beyond questions of credi- bility, that the artist has authority as creator of the work is predicated, in present terms, on the fact that he gives the work its title, at least most often; that he owns or chooses the objects depicted in it; and that he does the painting including all that leads up to it. However, that authority does not constitute, as an attitude of overesteem may lead one to sup- pose, a source of extraspecial certainty in the perceiver as to what he sees, or indeed certainty at all. In the first place, the artist is not the only person who by virtue of experience or of explanatory and analytical powers in front of the work itself can or may help out here. A work of art is not unique here amongst objects of perception nor indeed different in this respect as indicated previously, from any other artefact. And sec- ond, knowledge, whether the artist's or anyone else's, is not to be under- stood or defined as the acme on an ascending scale of presumption and certainty; nor as the necessary inspiration or fount of certainty, for though it may be that in the case of the third-person usage "It is certain that ... ," the same does not at all necessarily apply to first-person state- ments in the form "I am certain ... ," which record a personal convic- tion. If the artist says that an object in his work which has some of the defining characteristics of a mandolin is in fact a guitar, it might be demonstrable that he knew nothing whatever about musical instru- ments, but it is conceivable even then, and more likely in general, that his identification would win out, since reasons for the disputed feature being that way might plausibly exist and be given. To show the practical application of the points just made, however, it is more instructive to take up actual cases of what happens, in the move towards identification and recognition, and delineate in so doing some possible sources of confusion. Examples of a convincingness of evidence, deriving from elsewhere than from the artist himself and tied to a consideration of what the work itself shows, would be, first, Gauguin's Self-Portrait of 1889 with the crucified Christ to the left of it. Asked what one sees to the left here, and with no information to go by outside of the work itself, one would, beyond identifying Christ and a landscape, be most likely to say that this is probably a painting, or that one takes it to be that; for though planes and edges provide no clearcut evidence to this effect, consistency of handling and the implausibility of the Christ appearing in front of an exterior landscape view would suggest this. And it is in fact, as one can discover or be shown from a volume of plates, an earlier work of Gauguin's, the Yellow Christ, only partially shown, in reverse, and some- what altered, but with enough of a correspondence for it to be recogniz- ably that painting. Here special knowledge, of Gauguin's earlier work, leads to or sup- ports the recognition that this is a painting shown hanging on the wall</page><page sequence="10">686 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification FIG. 1.-Paul Gauguin,Self-Portrait with the Yellow Christ (c. 1889). Collection of the family of Maurice Denis, Paris. Photo Bulloz. behind the sitter. Gauguin himself did not, so far as is known or re- corded, say anything or offer any enlightenment on the subject. In the case of Pissarro's Self-Portrait of 1873, which similarly has paintings on the rear wall, even the possibility of considering the evidence as deriving from the artist, because he did the work in question, is effectively elimi- nated. Asked what he sees to the rear here, a person is likely to say unframed paintings of landscapes or what seem to be that. The expert can go beyond this and affirm that these are landscapes of Pissarro's own. Here, not only is there no guidance of Pissarro's to this effect; the canvases in question do not survive for comparison, and conceivably never existed. Yet the expert can still make his identification with confidence. Subject matter and handling, the framing and hanging of the works, and also the existence of a tradition of self-portraiture show- ing the artist in his studio with objects of his creation around him may be presented as the expert's basis. Yet these are only pointers; the confidence comes from their joint and interlocking contribution in a reading of the work as a whole.</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 687 ?  .. ? a ....

If the identification in those cases is called a certain one, it is proba- bly because of physical characteristics, shown or implied, and corre- spondences which rule out potential alternatives. But the distinction between knowledge and certainty, as it applies to recognition and identification, is more decisively illustrated by what one is told is there in the left background of Picasso's 1910 portrait Daniel Henry Kahn- weiler, and what one can make out visually in that part of the painting. It was put on record, from recollection, by Picasso that the object which</page><page sequence="12">688 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification *4L ~6k:W Y i'B1 .:::?i.* f ?r ?:a. ;:? ~-~a~.. ~6 ~a~BRa?*::?: ,?r;? . :i*~?I~IIIPl~%pls*"~I~t"- ~E? ---~a~ usb ~cruarr~i.l?; i??? ... .:,.. *?

This information is of course valuable as documentary evidence of Picasso's interest in primitive sculpture at the time; and given that there is a 1908 photograph showing such a sculpture on his studio wall, it helps to corroborate factually what can be deduced structurally from many of his</page><page sequence="13">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 689 paintings and drawings of 1907-9. But if one turns back to the portrait armed with that information, it seems doubtful, given the fragmented character of every image and part of an image, that one would say that one now saw clearly that it was a primitive sculpture, or that it undoubt- edly was one. Rather the likely comment would be that one could see that it might be such a sculpture or that it might indeed be the particular sculpture shown in the studio photograph. Since before the information was given, or without it, the comment could be offered that it might be, or could very well be, a piece of sculpture there in the background, the difference in phrasing resulting from the acquisition of special knowl- edge is not a matter of increased certainty, even if it might appear from the narrowing down that one was being more definite. Another possibil- ity would be to say that the object in question was, "we are told," a New Caledonian sculpture, where the qualifying phrase is both symptom and expression of a reservation that the visual indications impose. While this may seem like a version of the familiar conflict between visual evidence and factual authority, in which either one may prevail, the case is really one entailing the separation of intellectual and cognitive processes. The last of these examples leads into the question of authority in the domain of abstraction, and here again the terminology itself may be a source of confusion. Talk about abstraction from nature, signifying simplification, the elimination of detail, intensification of color, styliza- tion of contour and so on, conceives of what is done as a creative process personal to the artist, thereby suggesting his authoritative knowledge or understanding of the extent to which the resulting object or image will be recognizable inasmuch as he has control over the factors leading to that result. And indeed, asked to explicate what something is in a paint- ing of his, the artist may emphasize his abstraction from the object, rather than its representation, saying that this derives from a bottle, or is not really an apple any longer, or is only a hint of a door; or there may be evidence, in studies or the work itself, that recognizable imagery has been, in a systematic way painted over or painted out. But the degree of abstraction and the process involved constitute only one possible reason for the identity of an object to be unclear; and more important, abstrac- tion is not the antithesis of representation, where both are intended, the distinction being normally an aspect of the total structure--or to put it in terms of degree, in inverse proportion to recognizability. A certain amount of abstraction, and some manipulation generally of the objects' character, might indeed facilitate recognition. Correspondingly, when an artist such as Kandinsky or Mondrian represents a work of his as being a nonrepresentational painting, and the historian or critic says retrospectively that it is in fact a landscape with towers or a seascape of ocean and pier, the disagreement between them would either be an evaluative not an interpretative one or else more apparent than real. The workings of the subconscious, which may come into what the</page><page sequence="14">690 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification artist offers in the way of imagery, represent a whole extra dimension of inquiry bearing only peripherally on the present topic. When questioned from this point of view, the artist may generally say, with authority, that what is being talked of, such as the sexual connotation of a shape, is not something of which he was aware. The argument may then shift to the level or domain of the subconscious, which tends to have its own rules and principles of evidence and corroboration. In that area of discussion one tends to say, not that a certain object, in a dream or a painting, looks like a phallus, or that it is a phallus, but rather, in a special kind of language, that this is a phallic form, or one that has phallic significance. In the Freudian scheme of things, the artist when psychoanalyzed should be able to say that, though he was not aware of it till now, the phallic character or sexual nature of the object was there all the time, like an overtone to a word which is now brought out and retroactively recog- nized. The Move towards Recognition and Identification The circumstances can now be considered in which one moves to a recognition or clear identification in front of a painting, saying for ex- ample "I see now that it is a bottle" or "Now I can see what it is." With all such questions as faulty vision and its correction left aside, where a new pair of glasses might remove the difficulty in the same sense as an obsta- cle in the way is eliminated, what is in question here is a process: namely the way in which enlightenment comes to the spectator as to what an object is. On that basis a distinction can be made between mental states or conditions which may lead to an object being misidentified or not recognized at all-such as fixation on something else, overimagination or a contempt for the whole process of looking, these being like predispositions-and psychological factors-such as closeness of atten- tion or the existence of a prior framework of assumption-which may play a mediating role in the process under consideration and will come into an account of it correspondingly. The focus being, then, the kind of experience or intermediate step which leads or enables one to see, recognize or identify something in a painting as one could not do before, there appear to be essentially three different kinds of possibility. On the basis of special evidence, whether it comes from the artist or someone else, one is likely to say, as in the Picasso example, "Now I can see that it might be a sculpture." To say here "Now I can see that it is that" would seem misleadingly to imply that whatever basis one's previous reading rested on was relinquished; and certainly there are cases which argue strongly against that being so. In both a Matisse still life of 1906 and one by Picasso of 1907 or 1908, what had appeared plausibly enough to be a mirror included in the back-</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 691 FIG. 4.-Henri Matisse, Still-Life with Plaster Figure (1906).

Bequest of Mrs. Kate Lancaster Brewster. ground has turned out to be a painting of the artist's; and yet the factors, such as quality of surface handling, framing and placement, which led in each case to this being taken for a mirror do not thereby disappear or cease to apply, but rather an adjustment to the claims of the evidence is made, as a result of which the painting within the painting can be seen and characterized as indeed so treated that it might seem to be a mirror, or suggest one. On the basis of other of the artist's works that are compared, or on the basis of presence during the creative process, one would on the other hand be likely to use the phrase, conveying a move towards recognition</page><page sequence="16">692 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification and enlightenment, "Now I can see that it is ... ." In the case, for exam- ple, of Picasso's 1911 painting, The Accordionist, the view of the one-time owner, based on the artist's recording, on the painting's back, of the place where it was done, Ceret, was that it was a landscape; and such a view could be corrected by the comparison of other works of the period and the pointing out of comparably recognizable elements in them in the same or similar places, so that it was seen that this was in fact a figure painting, with the head at the top and the arms of the chair lower down. These or comparable elements might also be pointed out or noticed by a person present as they emerged or came into view during the painting of the work. On the basis of looking at the title or at an inscription on the back of the work for help and then looking back at the picture, both of the above wordings seem possible. If it were a photograph that one were looking at, with a caption identifying who was in it, it might be that not having seen or not having identified Mary before, one looked for her in the photograph and found her. Or one might say of a certain figure that it must be Mary, although it did not look like her, from some identifying element such as the scarf she had on; or see that it might be Mary, with back turned perhaps, when there was special evidence or no doubting that Mary was there at the time. In none of these cases would one be inclined or tempted to say "Now I can see Mary"; nor can it be said that one sees the figure in question differently. But there is also the possibility of a process like that of seeing, or being invited or led to see, a spot or stain on the wall as, for example, a face. According to a story told by Picasso many years later, he once teased and worried Braque by saying of a cubist still life of tobacco, pipe and cards that Braque was working on that he saw a squirrel in it; and he indeed persuaded Braque into a long and arduous fight to remove what he saw, which he described as an almost impossible struggle because the squirrel kept coming back. Though exaggerated response is the source of the humor here, a totally or potentially misleading title attached to a work and a statement about a painting of the kind that the story illus- trates might function similarly for the spectator. Rather than providing a clue or a more or less authoritative indication as to what is there, or where to look for what, as "Dead Bird" or "Bowl of Peaches" would typically be taken to do if there was any doubt on the subject, such a title or comment stimulates a particular kind of looking. It might be called looking with emphasis, or with more refinement, to bring out its charac- ter; with the understanding that there is nothing mechanical to it, or in the way of an impediment disposed of, as can be said to be the case where magnification is used on a photographic image of insufficient size, or a print is given clearer resolution, or a film image brought into focus. It could also be said that one looked under the direction of title or statement, as in looking for the figure in a pattern. And as with the</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 693 stained area of the wall and like Braque when he too saw the squirrel, one ends up seeing that area of the painting, or the whole work, differ- ently. There remains the question of what, more exactly, "seeing differ- ently" means here, as applied to a painting, part of one, or something included in one. For comparison there would be first seeing a configuration differently, as in the duck-rabbit example, or figure draw- ings of the kind that give a humorous change of image when turned upside down; the point in common here between these being, it might be said, that they can be read a different way round. Then there is the sense in which one says that one sees a person differently, as a result perhaps of finding out that he has been married twice and has five children. Whether such a remark is made of a person in the flesh, or as it could equally be of a portrait or a photograph, seeing of what is to be called an interpretative kind is in any event entailed. That this is so is brought out by such cases as seeing the moon differently, namely as spherical, now that the astronauts have landed on it; seeing from the caption to a photograph that a certain area or group has to contain an additional figure, namely Mary; and seeing analogously, in a complicated and con- fusing grouping within a painting, that a certain hand has to be the Virgin's left one. Lastly, there is seeing differently in the sense of seeing or noticing, as a matter of freshness or surprise, what one did not notice before: the face in the bush in a painting of Gauguin's, or that there are black geese flying to the left in a print of Escher's as well as white ones flying to the right. Omitted here is the case of seeing a speck turn into an aeroplane as it comes closer, since this is a matter of changed conditions that gradually allow one to see more, or in more detail, whereas the face, if unmistakable once seen, was there to be seen all the time. If, in the examples brought up earlier of the Gauguin Self-Portrait and the Matisse Still Life, one spoke of seeing the relevant area of the background differently as a result of being told that it consisted of a painting, it might be said that the elements had regrouped themselves, or had grouped themselves in a way that one was not aware of before. But it would be the interpretation put on their relationships to one another and their surrounds, or the corrective to one's prior assumption or interpretation-not to one's seeing-which here brought this about, perhaps gradually and not without struggle or resistance. The knowl- edge that it was a painting could be described as inclining one's percep- tion a certain way, towards a reading particularly in terms of plane rather than depth, and with some accompanying implications; or as giving an extra kind of dimension to one's seeing, as when one sees a face as more unhappy than one had previously taken it to be. By either account this would be a case of the second kind, into which belief may be said to come as support to the change, the word being used as in "I believe you" and in the phrase "suspension of disbelief."</page><page sequence="18">694 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification The stain on the wall, on the other hand, would probably be most like the first kind of case, with some features of the third. Just as, told that there is a duck, one may still only see the rabbit, deference to authority will not cause one to see differently here; and it may simply be a matter of narrowing one's visual search, in the sense of focusing it in one place rather than another. If, with a painting, what one had previ- ously described as a "sort of maze" becomes clearly a still life, the process may well be something like what takes place with the stain. One may look at the title, as indicated, or may simply be told to "look again." The total image stays the same, as with the duck-rabbit configuration and as the stain remains a stain. One's way of reading what is there changes, in the sense of acquiring a refinement or emphasis that it did not previously have; but only in that sense. References Introduction Perception of art and of the real world: the use of the term "aesthetic" in front of vision, perception, object, appearance, and so on begs a large question here; less so when it is used to differentiate situations and contexts, though there too may be a temptation to posit conditions or circumstances that are special in the sense of otherwise unparalleled. Literature on this topic: studies of the philosophical issues of perception and identification, as they apply to art, are conspicuous by their absence.

The discussion in the Philosophical Investigations, where it is coupled with the example of the schematically drawn face, is in fact less clear on the relevant issues than the prior discussion in the Brown Book of 1934-35 (see Preliminary Studies for the "Philosophical Investigations" Generally Known as the Blue and Brown Books [Oxford, 1960], pt. 2, sec. 16) where only the face was used; yet the face has not been taken up, only the duck-rabbit, and it has been used at the expense of cases, such as the surrealist double image cited earlier, where the alternative readings are not mutually exclusive ones.

Appendix A: Gombrich on Cubism Gombrich's discussion of cubism in Art and Illusion comes in pt. 3, "The Beholder's Share," at the end of the chapter entitled "Ambiguities of the Third Dimension." It deserves special review, because he is the only writer on questions of perception to have given major attention to cubism, first in a lecture of 1953 on "Psychoanalysis and the History of Art" and then again in Art and Illusion and in a 1961 article on "How to Read a Painting." Gombrich's stance in both book and essays is broadly antiphilosophical in the sense, implicit in all his later writings, of seeking in science and scientific psychology a concrete basis of some kind to set against the dangers, real or imagined, of dealing in philosophical terms-whether conceptually or analytically-with the relationship be- tween spectator and work of art. The effects of this attitude on the terms in which the argument is presented, and the way it proceeds, will be the focus here. The opening statement of the account, giving the essense of Gombrich's interpretation, is that cubism is "the most radical attempt [in the history of art] to stamp out ambiguity and to enforce one reading of the picture." The key word, ambiguity, here, as generally applied to cubism, serves to conjure up in that connection a complexity of structure that is visually fascinating and at the same time fraught with internal contradictions of a seemingly baffling kind. But while this might seem fully in accord with Gombrich's subsequent talk of contradiction, bafflement and elusiveness, there is an opposition beyond this in what is being said. For while in Rosenblum's account (1960 also), and Greenberg's of two years earlier, ambiguity is seen as willfully enforced, in the analytical phase of cubism, by the oscillation of planes and a whole series of shifting plays on the relationship between art and reality, in Gombrich's account it is potentially eliminated. It is therefore necessary to consider how exactly the term is being used for this divergence to be possible. There is a tradition in modern literary criticism according to which ambiguity designates the fact that, in a poem especially, a word or phrase can be taken in more than one way. Insofar as this represents something deliberate and consciously sought-rather than a function of the fact that certain words and combinations of words having more than one possible meaning inherently require a context in order to bring out which of those meanings is in question and may without adequate con-</page><page sequence="22">698 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification text fail to do so-ambiguity is associated with such willed qualities and controlled effects in literature as compression, wit or irony, and paradox. Rosenblum's use of the term clearly belongs in this tradition. There is also a usage in psychoanalytic theory, going back to Freud, and in the theory of symbolism and symbolic communication, whereby an image may, as in a dream, appear to signify and even to be two or more mutually exclusive things at once; and this kind of ambiguity may, upon more complete or deeper interpretation, yield to the understanding of those two different meanings or identities in a way that conjoins and even integrates them with one another. But Gombrich uses the term in a third and, as it may be called, technical sense: one deriving from the field of experimental visual psychology, where a particular kind of configuration, such as the celebrated duck-rabbit, which he uses as a key illustration, and others like it in principle, are used to stimulate and to gauge the faculty of visual projection because of their being susceptible to alternative readings which are mutually exclusive. Gombrich's use of ambiguity, therefore, corresponds to the first dictionary sense, "having two or more possible meanings," rather than the second dictionary sense of "unclear." The connecting link between these two different senses lies in the notion of openness to being taken in more than one way, which may apply in the case of art either to any individual element within the work or to the image as a whole, and comparably in the case of literature either to any particular unit of sense, such as a phrase or line, or to overall elements governing the whole such as story line or mood; and in the element or situation of puzzlement which is thereby generated. The distinction between them rests, philosophically, on whether or not the degree of specificity is sufficient either way for defining or characterizing purposes. An unresolved am- biguity may, in that perspective, be one either so left or so established that there is, or can be taken to be, equal justification for more than one alternative definition or characterization of what is in question; and this covers both of the possibilities presented by the two dictionary senses, since the justification, to be equal, does not have to be equally sufficient. To be talked of as unresolvable, on the other hand, ambiguity has to be of the kind designated by the second dictionary sense rather than the first; for it is necessary for this purpose that, in the case of literature or art, it should result from deliberate omission or other contrivance on the artist's part. Gombrich uses the term "unresolved" for the ambiguities of cubism, with the evident implication of sufficient specificity either way, as in the duck-rabbit example; and the illustrations which he brings into the 1961 essay in continuation of what he says about cubism-Rorschach blots, Tchelitchew's Hide and Seek and the work of Escher--confirm that impli- cation, in offering equal or, as with the geometric mosaics discussed in</page><page sequence="23">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 699 Art and Illusion, almost equal justification for alternative readings. But in interpreting cubism as directed towards the stamping out of ambiguity, by sheer extent of contradictoriness, he brings in the idea of unresolvable ambiguity as the ultimate form of unresolved ambiguity, higher in de- gree on the same scale. The linking bridge here, in what he says, is provided by the use of Thiery's figure, which Gombrich compares with the mosaic patterns and in which he finds the "quintessence" of cubism. But the features which give that figure its incorrigible instability, to which he refers, and its resulting oscillation show that a special form of unresolved ambiguity is in question, and one in which the ambiguity, rather than being eliminated, is recognized as unresolvable. A second problem, related through Gombrich's general view of all artistic images as ambiguous, concerns identification and "seeing as" and their respective roles in the reading of works of art. Gombrich begins the preceding chapter, "The Image in the Clouds," with a passage from Apollonius of Tyana which juxtaposes without differentiation the seeing of a cloud as a stag or antelope from its shape and the identification of a depicted figure as an Indian from the physiognomic features shown; and the same implication of their being no need for distinction here emerges from statements of his own. He discusses the statement "this picture looks like the castle there" as a comparative one, which is one possibility with this phrasing, and the most likely one in common prac- tice; but it is also possible that an imaginative construction might be being put on the picture, and what it suggested to the viewer might have primacy over the factor of resemblance. The same basic point is philosophically more explicit in the claim, formulated in reference to Maurice Denis' well-known statement about the essential nature of a painting, that it is impossible to "see" simultaneously both plane surface and a battle horse; for the effect of the quotation marks put around see here is to merge into one inseparable process the seeing of a painting as plane surface and the identification of a horse in it. Since to argue from these cases against Gombrich's general over- view of the operation of projection is to risk circularity, it is a more tangible measure of the difficulty to consider the application of what is philosophically debatable here to the specific illustrations used. Man- tegna in his Virtue Chasing Vice is described as "making us see" human faces in the clouds, though in fact the faces are painted in such a way as to be recognizably there in the clouds, and there is no question corre- spondingly of being led through suggestion to see the clouds as faces. In a poster by Fabian, the image of a factory chimney reading a newspaper is said to remain a chimney but to be also a face;whereas, except for two possible eyes, the way the relevant part of the chimney is treated seems neither to encourage nor to allow that it should be seen as a face. But it is in his later introduction of the Ames chair experiments that Gombrich</page><page sequence="24">700 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification most clearly implies that a bridge can be made between identifying and seeing as, on the basis of what, under scientific testing conditions, is shown to be the case there. Insofar as the illusion of seeing a chair in these experiments is comparable to what takes place with the patches of paint that make up a painting, it can be said that the effect of Gombrich's general argument about illusion is to represent identification in both of these cases as one kind of "seeing as." One sees the assembly of forms in space as a chair, as a consequence of the effective working of the illusion; and one identifies what one sees as a chair, when asked to say what is there. But, whether or not the relation between those two processes can be a matter of proof -and it is not shown to be that in the book--ordinary discourse distin- guishes two relevant senses of seeing as: the seeing of a hill as steep or steeper than one had thought, which corresponds to the seeing of a shape as a surface configuration or as being in front of another shape; and the seeing of a cloud as a map of Europe. The distinction rests on the dissociative character of the perception in the latter case: the cloud is seen as something other than what it is. The Ames experiments are similarly dissociative in character. This is made clear by the fact that, as Gombrich brings out, the illusion persists on the second viewing. Know- ing what one is looking at, one still sees the assembly of wires as forming a chair. So this cannot truly serve as a bridging case. And this point has an obvious carry-over to the discussion of cubism, where the identifying of a table as such may depend on quite different factors than, in Gombrich's phrase, being made to see the outline of a table. Finally, at least some comment is called for on Gombrich's attribu- tion of a single purpose or direction to cubism, irrespective of artist, date or stage of development. Having earlier specified that one learns within the context of one's culture to interpret artistic images as "records and indications of the artist's intention," he then suggests, as already cited, that cubism is to be taken as directed towards the stamping out of am- biguity; and later, that the "representational clues included" force accep- tance of the "flat pattern in all its tensions." Here, as compared to the use in the 1961 essay of a Picasso of 1911 to represent the devices of superimposition and telescoping, the argument is illustrated with two individual cubist works, a Picasso of 1918 and a Braque of 1928. This choice is appropriate to Gombrich's point about inconsistency and bafflingness insofar as, in both cases, the elements fit or sit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. But the kind of segmentation found here, which consistently denies continuity and connection across contours and dividing lines, is characteristic only of late cubism (after 1916-17). When it is said, therefore, that the cubists "discovered" that familiar shapes can be read and interpreted "even across a complete change of color and outline," it seems appropriate to ask when this took place, in terms of specific practice, and whether discovery refers here to anything more</page><page sequence="25">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 701 than a general territory of interest that the artists were exploring. More generally, if it were, say, the art of the High Renaissance or of Michelangelo that was in question, it seems highly doubtful that a com- parable overall intention or "point of it all" could be so easily ascribed to any phase or development. And certainly a unitary consciousness or sense of artistic direction, such as Gombrich's account hypothesizes, is uncharacteristic in principle of developments in modern art, and mod- ern culture in general, that cover any span of time and diversity of inclinations. In his 1954 essay Gombrich had taken a French academic painting of the Three Graces, from about 1900, photographed it through rolled glass, and compared the look that resulted with the general look of post- Cezanne and post-Fauve painting as illustrated by Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon. How exactly the comparison is to be taken presents some difficulties. If it were Delaunay's 1912 City of Paris that was used, with its Three Graces, rather than the Picasso, the kind of resemblance that Gombrich is positing would seem more strongly, and even specifically, conveyed. There, however, one gets a form of modeling deriving di- rectly from Cezanne, and an interplay of rhythms and planes which construct relationships between figures and environment, rather than making them difficult to grasp. The comparison might alternatively be taken as a metaphorical one, in the way that Herbert Read's comparison of the emergence of objects in a synthetic cubist painting to a lantern slide coming into focus has to be metaphorical in cast if it is to convey anything about what takes place in front of the work that is not either false to the nature of the viewing process or factually untrue. When Gombrich presents it as matter of attitude or decision on the modern artist's part that he should "apply the wobbly glass," there would cer- tainly seem to be no question of any actual or ascertainable relationship to the way in which Picasso and his contemporaries conceived of what they were doing; but a suggestion on that subject, based on surmise, would still be possible. Such being the case, Gombrich would then be attributing to the cubists generally a kind of provocative, and not neces- sarily altogether serious, play with the viewer's responses; and it would be the appearance of the work, rather than anything known about the process leading up to it, that gave rise to this view on his part. There would also be the implication that the recognizability of the images de- pends solely on the artist's structural treatment of them. The resulting picture of cubism then bears a striking resemblance to the story, pub- lished only later, of Picasso's teasing of Braque on the grounds that there was a squirrel to be seen in one of his pictures, so that Braque felt compelled to revise it. This, though a story about cubism and in keeping with Picasso's personality, in no way constitutes evidence as to either creation or commitment. Whatever it contributes is tangential to the real issues there, and even irrelevant to them.</page><page sequence="26">702 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification References Gombrich on cubism: Art and Illusion, pp. 281-85; "Psychoanalysis and the History of Art" (1953), InternationalJournal of Psycho-Analysis 35 (1954): 401 ff., rpt. in Meditations on a Hobby Horse (1963; London, 1971), pp. 40-42; "How to Read a Painting," Saturday Evening Post, 29 July 1961, pp. 20-21, rpt. in Meditations, p. 152.

In the light of the distinction he makes (The Possibility of Criticism, p. 30, replying to E. D. Hirsch, Jr.) between the indefinite (or unspecific) and the indeterminate, the claim in structural linguistics and semantics that all syntactical phrases are inherently ambiguous would be better phrased in terms of indeterminacy-resulting either from lack of assisting context or from being like a coded message without a base. Gombrich's general claim that all images are inherently ambiguous (Art and Illusion, p. 249) is a corresponding kind. Ambiguity in the technical sense in visual psychology: see R. L.

Appendix B: Panofsky on Recognition and Identification in Front of Paintings Panofsky's theoretical model of what takes place in the analysis of the subject matter of a work of art is best known in the form in which it appears introducing his 1939 Studies in Iconology; or from the re-use of that essay in his 1955 collection of papers, Meaning in the Visual Arts. There are in fact some modifications introduced in the latter version. More important, however, is the fact that the formulation of the model used here goes back still earlier, to an article of 1932 on the description and interpretation of the content of works of art. That version presents much more significant differences, both in the discussion of the indi- vidual elements of the scheme and in the nature of the scheme as a whole. It is therefore best to begin with what is said there within a Kantian rather than, as later, a neo-Scholastic framework and with some advantages of clarity or directness; and to consider against that back- ground the variations of the subsequent versions. The same example from everyday life being used to establish the scheme throughout, namely the meeting of an acquaintance on the street who greets one by lifting his hat, the particular way in which the apprehension of meaning there is subdivided into successive levels or strata can be followed through in terms of what is included under each. In the 1932 version, the subdivision is into, first, the concrete meaning of the act of lifting the hat, smiling and nodding the head. "Meaning" would seem intrinsically an odd term to use in this connection, what is recognized being the performance of the act or actions in question. This difficulty is shaded over by the later change to "factual" meaning, which is now described in terms which bring in identification rather than rec- ognition and take it as based on comparison with what is already known from practical experience. Second comes the expressive or, as it is later called, expressional meaning, which is a matter of the feelings towards the other person reflected in the way the act is performed. The subse- quent amplification, that this is identified by means of empathy, on the basis of sensitivity to expression in general, invites the qualifications that, if an implication as to how the person feels is being read into the act, as that account would imply, then the expression of feeling detected and</page><page sequence="28">704 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification attributed to the person may be in fact illusory, in the sense of being simply not there; and that the feeling may also merely inflect what the man does rather than express itself more generally and openly. In the 1939 version, the factual meaning and the expressive are brought to- gether to constitute, between them, the primary or "natural" meaning. Third in order comes conventional meaning, the act being taken in the light of custom or habit as a sign of courtesy; this becomes later desig- nated as secondary or conventional meaning, in indication of the shift here to a different level, as intelligible rather than sensible, and as a consciously imparted overlay to the action. Yet it is not clear why conven- tion, in the sense of recognized practice, should come in only at this point rather than in the making of the gesture of greeting, which is itself formalized and normally so taken without need for interpretation. Fi- nally, "beyond all these phenomena" (in the 1932 version), there lies the "impression of an internal structure" to which all of those factors that bear on personality and philosophy of life have equally contributed. The gaining of that impression is said to be independent of will or knowl- edge, and to preserve that independence, when what is in question has become redesignated as intrinsic meaning or content, experience is made the basis of the apprehension, rather than power of penetration or inference. The coordinates of observation and interpretation in this connection are at the same time extended, to include now character or personality, background or origin, present surroundings, and also period and previous history. And content now becomes the unifying principle which underlies and explains what takes places both on the first two levels and also on the third. As applied to the analysis of works of art, this breakdown yields, in Panofsky's earliest choice of example, the identification of the figure of Griinewald's Resurrection as a man, on the basis of practical experience of objects and expressions; as a man suspended in midair, on the basis of the history of style; as Christ ascending to Heaven, on the basis of the history of types, which is to say on the secondary level; and then beyond these lies the ultimate and essential content of the work, put alternatively as the world attitude which it reveals. In the 1939 version, where the example correspondingly used is Van der Weyden's Three Magi, primary or natural subject matter at the first level, comprising in its scope both the factual and the expressional, is the basis of pre-iconographic descrip- tion. At that level, the child in the Van der Weyden is interpreted, in terms of the history of representation, as hovering in midair. At the second level secondary or conventional subject matter supports icono- graphical analysis in a narrow sense; and at the third intrinsic meaning or content is the basis for iconographical analysis in a deeper sense. The first two levels of analysis are taken as prerequisites for the third, and this carries over to the later, 1955 version. There, however, the modification of the scheme so that the second level of analysis is termed</page><page sequence="29">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 705 iconography, entailing the articulation of the work into the history of types, themes and concepts, and the third one termed iconology, entail- ing articulation into the history of cultural symptoms and symbols in general, comes into seemingly irreconcilable relationship with the con- cluding declaration which has all three approaches fusing into "one organic and indivisible process." The main difficulty attending Panofsky's scheme, however, is that the processes of recognition, identification and interpretation in ques- tion cannot in practice be circumscribed and separated into successive strata in the way that the scheme would imply. The application of this point both to life situations and works of art can be illustrated by what takes place in the case of photographs. At, what is for Panofsky, the basic or primary level of response, one may on looking at a photograph make such comments as: (1) This is a figure, or a human being-that much being presumably recognized by a very young child who points at a picture or photo and says, wrongly, that it is "Daddy"; (la) This is a man and not a woman-as that might be said of the picture in Cracow, by Raphael or his school, which is variously called a portrait of the For- narina or of Raphael himself; (Ib) This is George-as a very young child, again, may identify a portrait of himself at a still younger age as his brother who is now that age. In the second and third of these cases, one is already dealing with the application of special knowledge. The young child who in (la) gets it wrong before a painting, may perhaps be helped by having it pointed out to him how hairdo, physiognomy or clothing point the other way. That is something done internally. In (ib), on the other hand, the ten- dency is to go, in terms of special knowledge, outside of the image itself: to the time the photograph was taken, what is written on the back of it or the association of the setting with a place that one visited in a certain year. But it may also be possible here to arrive at a resolution on an internal basis, as for example by pointing out the qualities of feature which make it definitely not George. The kind of remark which consists of saying "There's George" in front of a tombstone or fresco, when it could not possibly be him, rests on the same dual set of alternative possibilities, both of them entailing special knowledge: for either the situation in question, or the presence of information telling who it really is, may apprise one of its being a joke. A further range of typical comment, in front of a photo, might be: (2) That's a man skiing; (2a) That's a man three seconds after completing a Telemark; and (2b), with an aerial view, That's the skiing lodge, and the slope with the cable is there. It is not at all necessary, in the case of (2), to have an experience of the history of action photographs of skiing in order to make such an identification. It could be done purely on internal evidence, as in (2b): at first, perhaps, one is not able to read the photo, but then someone starts to explain how to do that, and one can go on</page><page sequence="30">706 Mark Roskill Recognition and Identification from there. Here again the assistance given is a matter of special knowl- edge, and it is this also that makes possible the step from (2) to (2a); knowledge external in that case to what can be read by going further into the image itself but open to being gained by looking in the right place rather than from experience, as for example by looking up a diagram of the Telemark and seeing that it fitted. Or again the comment might be: (3) That's David skiing; (3a) That's David skiing at the age of about fifteen; (3b) That's David skiing on Mont Blanc in 1972. These are cases in which an answer could be arrived at by internal scrutiny together, in various proportions and combinations, with external knowledge. There will be no need, in (3a), to have a series of photos for comparison, or mental reference, of David at various ages; the age or rough age of the boy here may well be deducible from inter- nal details. And in (3b) one may recognize internally that it is David, recognize it as a skiing photo, and apply the external knowledge that the only time David went skiing was on Mont Blanc in a given year. It follows from these considerations, therefore, that learning to read things in photographs, or films, posters or paintings, and learning what to call them go, from childhood up, hand in hand. The capacity to visualize things independently of having them before one obviously has some degree of correspondence to the stage reached on the first of those fronts; but it is also only natural that, as one's ability on that front becomes increasingly firm, there should be a tendency to use external knowledge more in combination with it-as happens when the imagina- tive component of what is shown in art, which has not been discussed here, is seen in the light of an historical and conceptual tradition. All through the cases discussed, in any event, it is special knowledge each time that makes it possible to go further. The main borderline here is, in fact, between those cases where one goes further by dint of reference to the image itself, and those where one does this by virtue of external information or some other person's knowledge. And even this is not a firm and absolute borderline. The three types of procedure described by Panofsky as being in- volved in the identification of what one sees in the Griinewald example as a man, as a figure in the air and as Christ correspond to operations which do certainly take place, and may well occur in that sequence. The critique here is not therefore of the levels in his account as such but of their logical interdependence as stated by him and their boundaries as drawn up by him, both of which aspects raise problems in the ways separately indicated. Panofsky's construction here might, it is true, be taken simply as a pleasantly argumentative piece of exposition, prefac- ing the studies that follow, with a scheme to it that does not ask to be taken too literally. But whether or not the view of a philosophy that this implies, as something of a decorative embellishment to the serious busi- ness of the art historian, is an overindulgent one in what it allows, it</page><page sequence="31">Critical Inquiry Summer 1977 707 would certainly seem proper to question the separation of acts or levels in a theoretical model of this sort when they are not separated in prac- tice. And the increasingly hieratical organization of the scheme, as Panofsky developed it, appears as a source of troublesomeness both in itself, and in terms of what happens when its application is turned back to be tested against reality.
