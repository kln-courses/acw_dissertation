KRULL Department of Social Science and History Capitol Campus Pennsylvania State University Middletown, Pennsylvania THE HIDDEN INDIAN IN COR TA ZAR S "AXOLOTL" rrhe Argentines, especially the artists, have long tilted at that psychological phantom of any pluralistic society, the cultural identity crisis. The jousting of civilization with barbarism in Sarmiento's Facundo and of civilized barbarity with barbarous civility in Mart(n Fierro wove a tangled maze into Argentine consciousness. Was the "true Argentine" the outward-looking portefio of Buenos Aires or the introverted gaucho of the Pampas? Should the Argentines send out feelers toward Euro- pean culture or roots into the indigenous heritage? Because of such cosmic soul-searching, the labyrinthine images of Julio Cortaizar's Rayuela fit naturally into his hero Oliveira's hop- scotching toward "home," first in Paris, then in Argentina. But the Argentines, like the Chileans and Venezuelans, have not generally had a lot to say about the central theme of the Mexican and Andean artists of the twentieth century, the interaction of European and Indian identities. Cortaizar, how- ever, has now raised his sights from the Argentine identity crisis to that of Spanish America as a whole by concerning himself with the role of Indianismo. The short story "Axolotl," Cortaizar's (1968) extended analogy between a larval salamander and the narrator, traces the Journal of I nteramerican Studies and World Affairs, Vol. 15 No. 4, November 1973 ? 1973 Sage Publications, Inc.

Leaning over the front of the tank each morning, the recognition was greater. They were suffering, every fiber of my body reached toward that stifled pain, that stiff torment at the bottom of the tank. They were lying in wait for something, a remote dominion destroyed, an age of liberty, when the world had been that of the axolotls. Yet the axolotls are now caged in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, the center of "Europeanism" for Latin Americans, particularly for Argentines like Cortaizar, who has lived in the French capital for many years. The daily confrontations between the "free man" and the tiny Mexican "brutes" leads inexorably to the mystery, wonder, and power of Latin Americans's Indian origins. The tension in Cortaizar's imagery communicates the potential for Latin American strength in the indigenous heritage. The narrator, face pressed to the invisible barrier of glass between human and amphibian, between European and Indian, at last becomes an axolotl. The etymology of "axolotl" (in Spanish, ajolote) is Nahuatl and curiously close to the mother-name "Aztec," and Cortazar's axolotls have the stereotypical traits associated with the Indian by most Latin Americans. Above all, there is the "Indian stoicism." Not only are the axolotls permanently fixed in the larval stage; they also have a "forced blankness on their stone faces" which mirrors their "mineral lethargy." In addition, there is a deprivation in the axolotls's "liquid hell." The narrator becomes aware of the axolotls only because the lions and panthers were less fascinating than usual, and they are "huddled on the wretched narrow floor of moss and stone in the tank." Only one word will suffice to explain-namely "slavery." They are "slaves of their bodies, condemned infinitely to the silence of the abyss, to a hopeless meditation." And finally, there is a remoteness, an exotic element in the axolotl which veils a "diaphanous interior mystery." Triangular heads, flaring gills, translucent pink flesh, and the tail of a fish carry one clear</page><page sequence="3">[490] JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS message that "they were larvas, but larva means disguise and also phantom." For the axolotls are the Feathered Serpent Quetzalocoatl-whose image was almost surely taken in part from these creatures-slouching toward a remote, liberated past to be reborn. They are permanently cramped into the past-into the larval stage. Or are they? "They were not animals." They are more interesting than the noble cats, and a living affront to the "banal" and "stupid" fish around them in the aquarium. Indeed, they are closer to humans than the anthropomorphic monkey. The difference is in the lidless eyes which never shut, which merge night and day and devour the narrator in a "cannibalism of gold." The vacant but knowing stare of the burning eyes in the pink, triangular faces obliterates all else. "Aztecness" is being reborn at the center of Europeanized culture-and Quetzalcoatl is merely awaiting the moment of his triumph. Even the guard can see that the narrator is becoming an axolotl, since he jokes "You eat them alive with your eyes, hey." The narrator, too, has become a cannibal-and is devouring himself from the inside. Not only are the axolotls not animals; they are also all too human. They are the chink in the European armor, the standing affront to the noble cats and stupid fish. The narrator naturally resists the "brute" inside him, but in vain. At first, there had been only curiosity: "Behind those Aztec faces, without expression but of an implacable cruelty, what semblance was awaiting its hour? " Then, there was fear. Then, doubt and struggle and an attempt "to prove to myself that my own sensibility was projecting a non-existent conscious- ness upon the axolotls." But it was no use, and "No transition and no surprise, I saw my face against the glass, I saw it on the outside of the tank, I saw it on the other side of the glass." There was no escaping it: there were now two narrators. The invisible barrier has been crossed but not broken. The face-the "human" visage-draws back from the glass a bit, the elfin newt-toes of the axolotls jostle the inside man, and little by little the outside man retreats to enshrine it all in the cold prose</page><page sequence="4">Knight, Krull / HIDDEN INDIAN IN CORTAZAR'S "AXOLOGL" [491 ] of Europeanized culture. But the axolotl lives on-inside, larval, waiting. The Aztec cannot be exorcised with words because he represents "something infinitely lost and distant" that pulls at Latin Americans. What is Cortazar implying? Some would, no doubt, have it that the Indianismo strain is predominant in Cortazar's mind, that the Mexican and Bolivian revolutions and the "Indianist" literature associated with them are a new wave of self-recogni- tion for Latin Americans. Certainly, "Axolotl" can be used as an introduction to the concept of Indianismo in the Aztec and Inca areas in the twentieth century. But in the end Cortaizar leaves the reader hanging in creative tension. Culturally and psychologically, the Latin American is two persons, European and Indian, observer and observed, axolotl and narrator. In a word, the Latin American is, like any other intercultural personality, laboring to build a culture, to form a viable synthesis, to discover who he is. The two extremes of Spanish America-Argentina and Mexico, "European" and "Indian" Latin America, narrator and larval salamander-meet on oppo- site sides of the semipermeable glass of culture waiting to be united in some dual, if unlikely, metamorphosis. In many parts of Spanish America the ages-old "assimilationism" of red-or black-to white through Hispanidad or another European "ism" has long since given way to an almost equally facile back-to- the-roots attempt to elevate Indianismo. But Cortaizar, perhaps because he is both an Argentine and an expatriate, knows that Latin Americans are not likely to identify en masse with Asturias's men of corn. Not even Vasconcelos's image of a cosmic race rising in the red-white-black rainbow of the Americas is powerful enough to convey Cortaizar's meaning. His "identity" is a hall-of-mirrors reflection with images retreating into infinity in all directions. The rainbow stretches from the salamanders we once were to the ideal men we might become (for confirmation of this view of Cort'azar, see Harss and Dohmann, 1967: 206-245). "Axolotl" is therefore a comment on the history the Spanish-speaking American identifies with. The discontinuity of</page><page sequence="5">[4921 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS the historical present and the continuity of the eternal present fuse in the moment of insight. The Aztecness which keeps seeping through into the present in Carlos Fuentes's novels is somehow juxtaposed to the Aztecness which rumbles under- neath Octavio Paz's poetry. In Fuentes, the historical present keeps intruding disjunctively-in the person of Ixa Cienfuegos in Where the Air Is Clear, in the revolutionary memories of the dying hero in The Death of Artemio Cruz, and in the Malinche-Mother of A Change of Skin. The center will not hold. But in Paz (1971 ), the axolotl has become the vital link between all Pasts and Futures: (The sun nailed to the sky's centre does not throb does not breathe Life does not commence without blood Without the embers of sacrifice the wheel of days does not revolve Xolotl refuses to consume himself He hid himself in the corn but they found him he hid himself in the maguey but they found him he fell into the water and became the fish axolotl the Double-Being 'and then they killed him' Movement began, the world was set in motion the procession of dates and names Xolotl the dog, guide to Hell he who dug up the bones of the fathers he who cooked the bones in a pot he who lit the fire of the years the Maker of Men Xolotl the penitent the burst eye that weeps for us Xolotl larva of the butterfly double of the Star Sea-shell other face of the Lord of Dawn Xolotl the axolotl)</page><page sequence="6">Knight, Krull / HIDDEN INDIAN IN CORTAZAR'S "AXOLOGL" [4931 Cortaizar, for his part, joins the time bound and the timeless and insists on the timeliness of both. The hall of mirrors distorts and redistorts identity, but without the reflections there would be no identity at all. Amphibian nature, poorly suited for either water or land, makes of the narrator-axolotl that double being living in the crease between past and future. "History," both "now" and "then" in both directions, is in the axolotl-and also the narrator. The glass is a permeable mirror, the present, in which both past and future are reflected. The time bound and the timeless are one in the Lord of the Dawn, Quetzalcoatl, who, like the larval salamander axolotl, is waiting perpetually to be born. REFERENCES CORTAZAR, J.
