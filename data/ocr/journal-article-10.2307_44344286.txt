<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOVE Alix Nathan She and Barney had been together three years. They met as students in eighties Lon- don; when he completed his PhD in cosmology Selina dropped out of music to fol- low him to Penn. Barney had deep-set confidence. Invariably found a table, tickets, taxi, the right jacket, the book he needed. He was the tallest man Selina had been out with: his fair, clean-cut head shone above the crowd, a welcoming statue of liberty in her jumpy, uncertain world. A pole star. His origins were humble, but cool determination, order, brain-power had taken him far; would take him further. Selina worshipped brain- power. To Barney, Selina's Englishness was exotic. She had class, left-wing credentials, a flat in Fulham. The window of her bedroom looked out on clotted blossoms of horsechestnut. She and her musician friends amused him: a little parallel world, colourful clothes, eastern cooking, their instruments in neat cases. They busked in the tube, Selina on a camping stool with her cello; made lots of money. Even Selina's unpredictability charmed Barney. England was to be gazed at, tasted, experienced. It had just gone to war with Argentina. He approved, even if the musicians didn't. There was immediate attraction of opposites - Selina was small, round, dark, restless; Barney had the calm of well-fed bones. The differences thrilled them, elec- trified their mutual exploration. Enjoyment seemed boundless. Selina's flatmate kept away. Then, when risen from Selina's spacious mattress they wrapped their arms round each other's subjects, sank their teeth into each other's intellectual passions. Bar- ney's field was cosmic background radiation; he was looking for evidence of varia- tion in its density. He frequently travelled up to Jodrell Bank to spend hours seeking barely detectable signals, sound waves in the gas. 'Music of the spheres,' Selina proclaimed. She took him to concerts, coached him in harmony and modes, in additive rhythms. He glowed to Boethian notation, vibrated to tonal systems derived from permutating intervals. In turn, she grappled with big bang concepts, hummed with delight at the imagery - dark energy, stellar fusion - for she had begun to write. 'I love it that we're poles apart,' she said. 'Magnetic pull.' And though metaphor discomfited him, he agreed. Barney had no intention of settling in England. Beneath its chic veneer, life there was archaic, mumbling, nuanced beyond recovery. His thesis complete, he needed to return. Selina's course unfinished, her future unclear, she needed him. His cer- tainty. The freeze of winter in Philadelphia pressed them closer. They clutched bags of groceries like children to their bodies. Drove through slushed streets in Barney's ageing bronze Chevy, a dodgem in a fairground. Curled under a rug, watched The Three Stooges. 15</page><page sequence="2">They took a train to New York for the day. On the busto Broadway they sat either side of an old woman in sneakers listening ferociously through headphones. 'Mind your hair!' she rasped at Selina in her ratty fur coat, tossed by the bus. Stepping off, they laughed hysterically though no-one noticed. They held each other tight on seething sidewalks, scraped up cash for an egg and lamb's lettuce sandwich, ran down the slopes in the Guggenheim. In spring they walked hand in hand through Tyler Arboretum; danced to Matisse in the Barnes. Bought enormous bars of chocolate in Amish country. Yet transposition to Philly had subtly changed the harmony. Selina caught the shade of a frown from Barney as she squeezed into another ethnic skirt and let her hair go its own way. She saved cello practice and vocal exercises till he was out. His collection of kitsch souvenirs from travels surprised, then irritated her. London was there: a model double-decker, a tiny Tower Bridge. She'd have preferred their down- town flat unfurnished, without the plaid three-piece suite bought with his first pay cheque, let alone the La-Z-Boy. Selina allowed herself a suspicion that Barney's interest in music lay in its sys- tems, its theories. He enjoyed rhythm, but neither melody nor harmony touched him. He was tone deaf. Her enthusiastic interest in cosmology revealed anthropomorphism, naivety. She thrilled to its surface, to its diction. 'Stellar Parallax - just listen to that phrase!' she cried one day. 'The music of it!' They were in bed, exhausted, but not too much. Barney rolled onto his stomach, his face in the pillow, pressed the ends up hard against his ears. Selina realised that she disliked waking to the smell of fried eggs and Sizzlean. 'l need flavour,' Barney protested without irony, in a way she'd always loved. She gave in. But another Terry Riley record, another La Monte Young and Selina said she might scream. 'Minimalism numbs the mind, wrecks the brain, Barney. At least try Bach canons.' 'I thought you were a socialist. It's like Copland - music for the common man.' 'The common man was whistling Haydn and Mozart in the streets of Vienna a hundred years before Copland's forebears even thought of leaving the Pale.' 'That's nasty, Selina. Anyhow this is 1 985 not 1 785.' 'And how often do you hear Terry Riley blasting out of car radios as they plunge in and out of the fucking potholes on Chestnut Avenue?' Her language, the whole exchange took them by surprise. Still, magnetic pull remained: ecstasy was not hard. Although snow had melted, they went out less, warmed themselves with ever greater heat, in bed, on the plaid three-piece, the breakfast bar. Burned out blemishes. Barney countered Selina's attack on Riley by not coming to the German Requiem in which she was singing with a city choir. Afterwards, as she left the Academy, a trio of Philadelphia matrons in glittering raincoats approached her. Thank you. Thank you so much,' they said, tears coursing down their bright orange, withered cheeks. Selina was moved, repelled. How could they love Brahms 16</page><page sequence="3">and get themselves up like that? She told Barney about it, just as she told him everything. She lacked his self-con- trol. Needed him to locate herself; his certainty about everything. He was not inter- ested in her observations. 'What's the problem, Selina? You sound like Edith Wharton.' He was remarkably erudite. 'At least she had the sense to live in Europe/ she said, regretting it instantly, too late. They slept back to back that night, but consoled themselves in the early hours before Barney rose for his Sizzlean. Most mornings Selina practised and wrote. A novel grew, shrivelled, grew, died. Afternoons she earned a few dollars. She couldn't tell if her need for Barney was the cause or result of her shrunken life. 'We don't talk much any more,' she complained. 'Look, Selina, my project needs time. We have to discover what happened and what will happen. How the universe began. How it will end.' Big crunch or black hole. He'd explained back in London. 'We all come to an end anyway. Isn't the big question what for?' 'It's not my question.' 'It's everybody's question! Herr, lehre doch mich,' she sang at him, 'dassmein Leben ein Ziel hat' He walked away. For hours each day he was off in the Chevy to the observatory; alone with the tel- escope and its operator. In the flat the door to his study stayed shut, his computer possessed him. They retrieved themselves after dark; recalled, re-enacted. Then came MOVE. Late one Monday afternoon in May, police dropped a bomb on a row house in West Philadelphia. Eight people inside were killed, including two children. The fire that broke out burned for an hour before firemen came. Sixty houses were destroyed. 'A scene of unbelievable devastation' said the Inquirer the following day. Endless footage of smoking ruins filled the screen. Like everyone else in Philly, Barney and Selina stared, bemused. Terrorism wouldn't touch the US for another six- teen years. But this wasn't terrorism; it was sixties counter-culture twenty years on. MOVE were anarchists, a dredlocked 'family' surnamed Africa who wanted to get back to nature and hated technology. For their respectable black neighbours back to nature meant no sanitation. Back to nature meant leaving your dead on the ground to rot. (Denn alles Fleisch es ist wie Gras, thought Selina.) After a while she said: 'I don't believe I'm seeing this.' Barney grunted and folded another peanut butter sandwich. You can't say things like that to a scientist. 'It's completely outrageous,' she tried again, opening a window in the heat. 'Dropping a bomb on a house with children in it, in a suburb. What happened to civ- ilization? What happened to restraint?' They had weapons and they killed a cop in 1 978.' 'Oh, for god's sake, Barney. A bomb in your own city.' 'They couldn't take chances. And the people in the street had been complaining 17</page><page sequence="4">for months about MOVE haranguing them through loudspeakers at night. They wanted MOVE out. They wanted action.' They didn't exactly want children smashed to bits and their street burned down.' 'The fire was unintended. Those MOVE guys were armed; they'd built a bunker on the roof. They meant business.' 'You're telling me that when people have guns and a megaphone you drop a bomb. Big bang!' 'That was unworthy of you, Selina.' 'You're right. Perhaps I should just think of it as a symbol/ she shrilled. 'A sym- bol of . . .' 'Don't! Leave symbols to math! Selina, you're wrong. It's a minor event in the life of the universe.' He rolled a joint and put on Riley's In C, the world's most monoto- nous piece. She went out for a walk. Later he slept in the La-Z-Boy. In the library where she shelved books, scribbled fragments of fiction, ignored the bitching of colleagues, she talked to Velma, the only black librarian. In her uni- versity vacations in London Selina had cleaned hospital floors and lavatories side by side with sad-faced Somalis. She'd listened to their longing for lost lives, felt them harden to the cleaning manager's vile racial abuse. Velma was surely reeling. 'Velma. This is bad. How can it have happened? Osage Avenue, I mean.' 'Yes. MOVE are bad people. Dirty, filthy people. Raising their children like that; where d'they get the ideas?' 'I mean bombing the house, Velma. Nobody should ever do that, however bad the people are inside.' 'Mayor Goode knew what he was doing. He has faith. He's a good Christian.' Selina pushed away the book trolley. A crepitus of fractured impressions filled her head. Grated, ground, crumbled. Nothing cohered. She'd been reading about Edith Wharton. Like her, she thought, she'd control every plant in her garden. So she garnered up her images, tried reticence. Barney stayed behind his door, she behind her book. They passed like distant comets. Col- lided only in bitter, physical need. Emerging from the tangled sheet, Selina told Barney about Velma. 'It isn't a race issue, Selina.' He ran his hand over his hair -a gesture she'd once adored. 'Mayor Goode is black.' 'I know, but Police Commissioner Sambor isn't. Those people in Osage Avenue and Pine Street, their grandparents were probably slaves. Their houses represent freedom and independence and the administration, for the sake of conformity, has overreacted and destroyed them.' 'Oh you British with your little houses and gardens. Each a micro version of the King in Buckingham Palace.' 'Queen.' 'You British think you know it all just because you're old. You are old. Played out. You'd all be speaking German now if it hadn't been for us.' 'You wouldn't exist if it hadn't been for us.' 18</page><page sequence="5">He hauled his bedclothes back to the La-Z-Boy. Attraction had turned its janus face. Even the image had changed, thought Selina: whatever happened to magnet- ism? They were stars in the darkness, aeons apart. No. They were enemies. They waved flags at each other, shouted through tannoys, choppered in their troops. Abused each other's nations while the real cause lay untouched. Barney's mental eye gazed upwards, outward, while Selina's was earthbound; her thoughts moved overa ground-bass. His brain breathed pure ether, hers inhaled vibrations through her feet when singing, through her knees pressed to the cello. His timescale spanned hundreds of thousands of years. Hers was measured by bar lines - einer Hand breit. Difference had drawn them together. Difference was splitting them apart. Theirs had been a physical consonance. Stellar fusion, she thought, with desperate long- ing. It had never been a marriage of true minds. Dissonance drove Barney to retreat for ever longer periods at the observatory. In Selina it induced a state of terror. Her grasp slipped and slipped again. Like the peo- ple on Osage and Pine she wanted action. Big crunch. While he was away, she broke open his study door, ripped the wires from the computer and swept his files onto the floor. She tore up the covers, bent and cracked his records. Riley went first, La Monte Young followed. She heaped buttoned-down shirts, poplin jackets, neatly creased Levis, slim-fit tartan boxers on the La-Z-Boy and soaked them in diet Coke. Threw armfuls of Sizzlean, pickles, ketchup, frozen yogurt, Cheerios, Hanover DeN-style Four Bean Salad onto the bed. Crowning the pile with a tub of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, she laughed aloud. Maenadic revenge. Then wept at her loss, her hypocrisy, her failure to ask what for? She remembered Barney telling her about the Doppler Effect. A lovely, sun-lit afternoon on the Fulham mattress. Shadows of blossom on the wall, eyes glistening with love. It was the name for the shift in frequency of emitted waves when an emit- ter moves relative to an observer. They'd both been emitters, both observers, she and Barney. The pitch of sound had shifted from high to low and now they'd moved so far apart that sound waves had lengthened beyond detection. Barney hated metaphor. A coda: she wrote it in a note for him and left. Stories by Alix Nathan have appeared in Ambit, London Magazine and New Welsh Review. A collection is nearing completion. 19</page></plain_text>
