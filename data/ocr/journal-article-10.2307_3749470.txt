<plain_text><page sequence="1">Analogy Today PATRICK J. SHERRY The Openness of Language During the last few years many writers have pointed out that notions like 'family resemblance', 'open texture' and 'systematic ambiguity' which play a considerable role in contemporary philosophy are akin to Aquinas' concept of analogy. Yet no one has made a thorough comparison between modern linguistic philosophy and the Thomistic doctrine of analogy. In this article I want to explore their relationship and to assess the value of the latter. Just how much has Aquinas to contribute to modern discussions about the nature of language and about God's attributes? And does modern philosophy of language destroy Aquinas' case, or can it rather be used to supplement it? Despite all its complex ramifications, the purpose of Aquinas' teaching on analogy at any rate is fairly simple. He is attempting to answer questions like: 'How can we speak of God using terms derived from our ordinary language?'; 'Are the terms used to describe God to be taken in the same sense as in their other uses?'; 'Granted that all human language is inade- quate to describe God, yet surely some terms must be at least more appro- priate than others?' But his answers to these questions raise ontological and epistemological issues: for our predication of certain attributes to God requires a foundation in God's nature, and it presupposes that we have some knowledge of this foundation. Aquinas argues that God, qua Creator, is the source of the being and perfections of His creatures; and that we can know this to some extent through the use of our natural reason. It is this ontological and epistemological foundation of his teaching on analogy that arouses the greatest disquiet among many theologians and philosophers, rather than its linguistic aspect. Most Protestant theologians feel that there is an element of what Pannenberg calls 'spiritual assault' in it. Hence Karl Barth condemned the analogia entis as 'the invention of Antichrist', in comparison with which all other reasons for rejecting Roman Catholicism are insignificant (Clhurch Dogmatics I, i, p. x). Now it is important to see that Barth is not denying that words are used analogically of God: later on he himself adopts a theory of analogy when discussing God's attributes. But he is denying that there is a 'bond of being' between God and creation which the human intellect can know through its own powers without God's revelation. If, with a recent Thomistic writer, we regard the so-called analogy of being as the order of things underlying the Philosophy 51 1976 43'</page><page sequence="2">Patrick Sherry analogy of 'being',1 then Barth is worried by the former. Similarly, most philosophers are more opposed to the Natural Theology which undergirds Aquinas' teaching on analogy than to his views about predication as such. These facts have led some contemporary Roman Catholic writers to play up the linguistic aspects of analogy. For instance, Fr. H. McCabe has recently argued that ... too much has been made of St Thomas' alleged teaching on analogy. For him, analogy is not a way of getting to know about God, nor is it a theory of the structure of the universe, it is a comment on our use of words.2 I do not, as it happens, agree with this as an interpretation of Aquinas, since I think that his views on analogy are closely tied to his metaphysics of being. But it does raise the question of whether we can accept the philosophical or theological objections to Thomistic metaphysics and yet salvage much of Aquinas' teaching on analogy. It is conceivable that analogy as a linguistic theory can stand on its own feet, or that alternative religious or metaphysical supports are possible. We might start our consideration of the linguistic aspect of analogy by looking at the way in which language grows, and in particular at the diver- sity in our uses of many common words. In any living language there is a natural process of stretching whereby words acquire new uses. Many familiar expressions like 'fit in', 'feel better' and 'upright man' were origin- ally metaphors which have gradually become incorporated into common idiom. Likewise, many words have a number of different senses: Aquinas often cites Aristotle's example of 'healthy' which can be predicated of causes or signs of health, like seaside resorts or complexions, as well as of biological organisms. In The Blue Book Wittgenstein discusses the many different senses of 'proof' and 'discovery', and concludes that There are words with several clearly defined meanings ... And there are words of which we might say: they are used in a thousand different ways which gradually merge into one another. No wonder that we can't tabulate strict rules for their use (p. 28). Earlier on in the same book he had attacked the 'tendency to look for something in common to all the entities which we commonly subsume under a general term', and had introduced the idea of 'family likeness', giving the example of the word 'game' (p. 17. Cf. Philosophical Investigations I, 65-66). One could provide many other similar examples, e.g. the variety in the uses of the word 'make': we can make clay statues, meals and fortunes; we can also make mistakes and decisions; and we can make other people angry or sick. Moving on to something more germane to theology, 1 Ralph M. MlcInerny, The Logic of Analogy (The Hague: M. Nijhoff, i96i), p. i67. 2 Blackfriars ed. of Summa Theologiae, Vol. III (London: Eyre and Spottis- woode, I964), p. io6. 432</page><page sequence="3">Analogy Today we might notice the variety in our application of words denoting perfec- tions. We use words like 'rich', 'flourishing', 'strong', 'sound' and 'life' in all sorts of contexts. The word 'love' is used of many different kinds of human relationship (not to mention its use as describing the object of love-'My love is like a red red rose'), and it is doubtful whether one could find any satisfactory definition covering all of them. It would be very difficult to explain to a child what mature human love is like: we would ask him to think of his feelings towards his parents, friends or pets, and then say 'Well, it's like it in some respects, but different in others'. But the result would be highly inadequate, both because of the child's lack of understanding and because here we do not have a likeness between two species of one genus 'love', but rather a family resemblance between two things. Similarly, the word 'intelligent' has a variety of uses: it is ascribed to people's creations as well as themselves ('an intelligent film'; 'a thought- ful book'); and it is ascribed to animals as well as to men. We may perhaps try to arrange different forms of intelligence in some kind of hierarchy. This would be not so much a case of finding a common IQ scale along which we range all beings, but of seeing the inter-relationship between the different forms. Human intelligence unites the cleverness of a fox, the constructiveness of ants and bees, and so forth. More generally, higher forms of life include and transform many of the qualities of lower forms (hence Penido suggests that this is a good analogy for understanding the procedure whereby we attribute perfections to God).3 These different uses of words like 'healthy', 'love' and 'intelligent' are not cases of equivocation, since there does seem to be a relationship between them. In some cases there is one central sense to which the others are related: Aristotle and Aquinas both argue that the attribution of 'healthy' to persons and animals is the primary sense, since only they are intrinsically healthy; the other uses are derivative, since they are to be referred to the primary sense-they denote causes or signs of health; more controver- sially, Aristotle argued that the primary sense of 'being' is that of substance, since the being of other categories is dependent on that of substance. Be that as it may, it is certainly true that the words I have mentioned are very different from ones like 'pen': it is purely fortuitous that we use the same word for a writing implement and an enclosure for animals. Hence it seems reasonable to devise an intermediate category between 'univocal' and 'equivocal' in which to accommodate words like 'healthy'. This category is described as that of 'analogous terms' by Aquinas. So far so good. I have merely pointed to a feature of natural languages and suggested a way of describing it. Now Thomists then proceed to argue that we cannot set any a priori limits to this feature of language, and that it is legitimate for theologians to avail themselves of it. But I think that 3 Le rolle de l'analogie en the'ologie dogmatique (Paris: Vrin, I931), pp. I54ff. 433</page><page sequence="4">Patrick Sherry at this point two important objections arise which must be faced. Surely the issue of divine perfections raises very special problems, which are not settled simply by pointing to the 'open texture' or natural process of growth in language? And is it really true that we need a category of 'analogous' terms-why not just call them 'systematically equivocal' or, if you prefer, simply record the variety of supposedly univocal language? Divine Perfections Let me take the question of God's attributes first. The trouble is that my appeal to 'family resemblances' and so forth may have proved too much. Surely the religious believer does not want to say that the relationship between the justice and mercy of God and those of creatures is rather like that between the games of rugby and whist? We might, for all we know, land up with something very far removed from our conceptions of these perfections. Nor is the more traditional example of 'healthy' much better. The believer does not think that God simply causes perfections in creatures as yoghurt produces good health in people, without there being any likeness between the two; he believes that God really is, somehow, good, loving, just, merciful and so on in Himself, that there is some degree of likeness between His perfections and ours, and that therefore we use the same terms of both. Thus unless God's love, for instance, involves at least that He desires the good of those whom He loves, then the word suffers what Flew has called 'death by a thousand qualifications'. It is at this point that we need to devote attention to something often ignored in discussions on Aquinas' views on analogy (e.g. in Humphrey Palmer's recent Analogy) namely his via remotionis and via eninentiae. This is a very important part of his teaching about God's attributes and an essential correlate of his views on analogy. Aquinas does indeed regard God's attributes as different from ours and is anxious to avoid our anthro- pomorphizing Him. But he allows for a relationship between them. At the weakest level, he says that God causes our perfections and that He is the prime analogate in the attribution of terms like 'good' and 'wise'. This, however, is insufficient, since it allows only for the kind of relationship that exists between health and its causes. Nor is much gained by saying that there is a proportional likeness between God's attributes and ours, that, for instance His knowledge stands to His essence as our knowledge stands to created beings (IV Sent. 49, 2, i ad 2), since this still tells us nothing about the connection between the two. Hence Aquinas also insists that God is indeed good, wise, and so on in Himself, that our perfections have some likeness to His, as images related to an original, and indeed that they can be said to 'participate' in His (S.T. ia, vi, 4; xiii, 5, 6, IO; xiv, 6). Moreover, he sketches out a procedure whereby we can take a term 434</page><page sequence="5">Analogy Today describing a worldly perfection and go on to apply it to God without any impropriety. We take a perfection, remove from it whatever is creaturely or implies a limit, then we project it without limit and attribute it to God. Thus in the De Potentia he allows that terms like 'good', 'wise' and 'just' are first employed to signify creatures' perfections; but such perfections are divine outpourings and have a likeness to their source; hence we 'ascribe the same expressions to God in a higher degree' (VII, 5 ad 3). This teaching is repeated in the Summa Theologiae, where we are told that '. . . in this life we do not see the essence of God, we only know Him from creatures; we think of Him as their source, and then as surpassing them all and as lacking anything that is merely creaturely' (ia, xiii, i). These perfec- tions are in God in a supereminent degree; moreover, they 'pre-exist in God unitedly and simply, whereas in creatures they are received, divided and multiplied' (ia, xiii, 4). These various qualifications, along with the use of the via remotionis, guarantee that we are not simply projecting a scale of human qualities and placing God at the final point-as if He simply knew more and had a bigger IQ than we have. Aquinas is careful to insist that no creature has a perfection in the same way that God does, and that the imperfect likeness between creature and God is not a generic one (I Sent. 22, I, 2; S.T. ia, xiii, 5 ad 2); moreover, he allows that each kind of creature has its own special kind of perfection-the goodness of a man, for instance, is not directly comparable to that of a sharp knife.4 Duns Scotus outlines a similar procedure in his discussions of God's attributes: he argues that we take concepts like 'wisdom' or 'intellect', remove their imperfections and limitations, and then attribute them in their utmost perfection to God (Op. Ox. I. iii. 2. IO; viii. 3. 8). Where he differs from Aquinas is in his denial that this procedure makes them non-univocal: he thinks that our ability to infer something about God from creatures demands concepts common to both (though not necessarily generically common). I shall discuss this point later; for the moment I want to note the similarities: both Aquinas and Scotus allow for an 'open horizon' in which we use language to point in the direction in which God is to be found rather than to represent Him. The via eminentiae constitutes this pro- cess of pointing. But how do we decide what constitutes a perfection and whether God has it? The use of the via eminentiae presupposes that we know that God 4 On the other hand, he insists that all forms of perfection are linked with God's: he says both that creatures have their own intrinsic form of goodness and that God is 'the first exemplary, effective and final principle of all goodness in creation', so that all created goodness is named from divine goodness per analo- giam (S. T. ia, vi, 4). Putting the matter in Cajetan's terminology we might say that goodness involves both Analogy of Proper Proportionality and Analogy of Attribution. 435</page><page sequence="6">Patrick Sherry exists and that He has certain attributes. Aquinas has a double argument5 on the latter point, set out in S. T. i a, iv, 2: (a) God causes perfections in creatures, therefore He must have the perfections which He causes, because no effect can have a perfection not possessed by its cause. (b) God is the self-subsistent being, so He must have every conceivable perfection. Clearly both prongs of this argument raise formidable difficulties: the first one involves very ambitious claims about causality, suggesting many obvious objections, whilst the second presupposes a complex and far-reach- ing philosophy of existence. Of course, the difficulties in Aquinas' argument do not affect what he says about analogical predication in general. But they are very relevant to the ontological and epistemological underpinning of his ascription of certain predicates to God. If the objections are sustained, we shall have to find an alternative support. An even more fundamental difficulty is that even if we accepted Aquinas' two principles, we would still be hard put to it to decide which perfections are appropriate to God. Wisdom, love and incorruptibility are obvious candidates (in the case of the God of Judaism and Christianity). But strength is more difficult: just what kind of power is to be attributed to Him? And what, if any, sense of impassibility is appropriate? Many of the traditional attributes naturally attract Whitehead's gibe about paying metaphysical compliments to God. Some compliments, no doubt, are appropriate, but our choice will depend on difficult ethical and meta- physical decisions. More obviously, our choice is going to depend on our religious views: now it is worth reminding ourselves at this point that the terms which Aquinas uses of God in his discussions of analogical predica- tion, e.g. 'wise', 'good', 'faithful' and 'merciful' are in fact the same as those used by ordinary believers. Moreover, they are the same as those used in the Bible: Aquinas' language of 'participation' may stem from Plato, but it also echoes St Peter's 'You will be able to share the divine nature' (II Pet. i, 4). 6 When discussing Barth's rejection of the analogia entis Henri Bouillard remarks that the Thomistic method of negation and eminence would be merely a fantastic projection, were we not already moved by the 5 Actually, there is a third argument, that of the quarta via, where Aquinas argues both that there is something truest, best and noblest, and that this Being is the cause of all perfections in creatures, because 'the maximum in any order is the cause of all the other realities of that order' (S. T. ia, ii, 3). 6 Similarly, Plato's insistence that we should make ourselves like the divine (Theaetetus, 176B; cf. Republic, 5ooC) may be compared with 'Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect' (Mt. v, 48; cf. Lk. vi, 36) and 'we shall be like Him' (I Jn., iii, 2). Both these authorities should deter theologians from making too great a separation between divine and human attributes. 436</page><page sequence="7">Analogy Today presence of God within us.7 This should not be explained, I think, in terms of isolated 'religious experiences', but more in terms of a whole way of life: religious people regard their beliefs as providing both an understand- ing of the world and a road to holiness, and they look on the benefits of their religion as gifts of God; hence they speak here of 'grace', and of God's 'love', 'wisdom' and other attributes. They may also speak of His 'activity' in their souls, of His 'working' through men's hearts, and so on. As regards the natural world, they look upon it as His creation and think of its perfec- tions as signs or tokens of His nature (cf. Plato, Timaeus 29e). Seeing a landscape of great beauty or meeting a person of impressive holiness are taken as revelations of something beyond them. These considerations might also perhaps do something to explain the religious motivation of Aquinas' adherence to the principle that 'everything brought to perfection pre- exists in the producing cause in a more excellent mode' (S. T. Ia, iv, 2). Most Christians, of course, would want to supplement these remarks by pointing to Christ, as one who embodies divine perfections and is a source of knowledge about God (I am surprised, incidentally, at how rarely discussions about divine attributes and about analogical predication introduce the question of the Incarnation, which is very important both for deciding what attributes are to be ascribed to God and for considering the relationship between human and divine perfections). These suggestions do not by themselves justify Aquinas' extraordinary metaphysical contortions, but they may show us something of the religious views which he was trying to express and explain. Analogy, Univocity and Equivocation My second objection raised the question of whether we really need a category of 'analogical' terms besides 'univocal' and 'equivocal' ones, granted that recent philosophy has shown the complexity and variety of supposedly univocal ones and that we allow for some equivocal terms to be systematically so. It might well be argued that 'univocal' and 'equivocal' are contradictories, excluding any possible third category. It does seem to be rather a rag-bag category, anyway. Moreover, one often feels uneasy about many of the terms which theologians claim as examples of analogy: it is not prima facie obvious that terms like 'wise' and 'just' are not univocal. Of course, everyone agrees that 'healthy' is not simply univocal, because it has three very disparate (though connected) uses, which cannot be subsumed under one concept. But one is less convinced by what Aquinas says about, say, wisdom. Are the differences between God's wisdom and ours sufficient to make the term 'wise' non-univocal? After all, Duns Scotus 7The Knowledge of God, trans. S. D. Femiano (London: Burns and Oates, i969), p. iii. 437</page><page sequence="8">Patrick Sherry realized these differences but still insisted on univocity. Moreover, the theological considerations which I have noted make it undesirable to make too big a gap between divine and human attributes. Our answer to this objection will depend on what definition of 'univocal' we employ. And it is important to note here that Aquinas and Scotus have different definitions, and that this fact largely accounts for their divergent views on analogy. Scotus adopts a simple logical approach, designating a univocal concept as one which has sufficient unity in itself that it can serve as the middle term of a valid syllogism and that it cannot be affirmed and denied of the same thing without contradiction (Op. Ox. I. iii. 2. 5-6). By contrast, Aquinas' definition of 'univocal' is far more complex and involves many metaphysical issues. Let us look at his definition and at the main reasons he gives for thinking that we cannot predicate terms like 'wise' univocally of God and creatures: (i) Univocity requires one genus, divided by differences, and one form or concept ('ratio') in which all the subjects of predication participate equally. But God is outside any genus. Moreover, many analogical terms are trans-categorical anyway, regardless of their application to God, and so are not divided by formal differences. (2) Because of this, univocal terms have one concept ('una ratio') which can be abstracted, e.g. 'animal'. But in the case of analogical concepts there is no common concept in which all analogates participate equally. Rather, there is a concept which applies properly to only one of the things named (the 'ratio propria', e.g. 'healthy' as applied to men), and the other concepts are related to this 'per prius et posterius'. Hence at best only an imperfect and confused concept can be abstracted. (3) God and creatures have different modes of existence: He has His being essentially. (4) God is not a univocal agent, i.e. an agent having the same mode of existence as its effect and resembling it in the same manner. No finite creature is adequate to His power, or has more than a distant likeness to Him. (5) God is wise essentially-indeed He is wisdom; but creatures have perfections only by participation and as accidental qualities. (6) Hence creatures' perfections are limited, but God's unlimited. Moreover, perfections pre-exist in God unitedly and simply, whereas in creatures they are received, divided and multiplied. Univocal terms circumscribe and comprehend their object, so they are unsuitable to describe God's perfections.8 8 See especially S.T. Ia, iii, 3, 5; iv, 3; iv, 3 ad 3; v, 6 ad 3; vi, 3; xiii, 4, 5, 5 ad i and 2, 6, iO; xvi, 6; ia, 2ae, lxxxviii, i ad i; C.G. I, 32; De Pot.

Clearly Aquinas is stipulating that certain metaphysical considerations are to count as necessary conditions of univocity. But a logician might question many of Aquinas' stipulations. And that is just what Scotus does, in some cases. For instance, he argues that since God has some likeness to the perfections He causes in creatures, this entails that there be a concept common to them both, albeit not a generic concept; such concepts do not circumscribe their objects, because they have an 'openness' which renders them applicable to both finite and infinite (Op. Ox. I. viii. 3. IO, i6f., 28). He agrees with Aquinas that being is not a genus, but he does not think that this makes 'being' non-univocal (Lect. I, iii, p. I, q. 2-Vat. ed. XVI, pp. 272f.). More generally, he thinks that any comparison between things must involve univocity, particularly when things 'participate' in the perfection of their cause (Op. Ox. I. viii. 3. 9-I2). Since Aquinas and Scotus are approaching the question from different standpoints, wve cannot simply say that one is right and the other wrong. But it is worth noting that Scotus' logical approach is far nearer than Aquinas' to modern discussions about what it is for words to have the same sense and about what constitutes ambiguity. Prima facie a difference in category does not necessarily preclude univocity. Fred Sommers gives two examples: My headache lasted as long as the lecture. Mary is more interested in men than in mathematics.9 This is reminiscent of Scotus' point that comparisons involve univocity and suggests that we might approach the matter by using sentence-frames of the form 'x is more F than y'. Thus if we put: Blackpool is healthier than my complexion we get an odd result, suggesting that 'healthy' is being used equivocally here. On the other hand, no problem arises if we write: Blackpool is healthier than Southend because both names are those of causes of health. Now if we apply this approach to attributes like 'wise', 'loving' and 'just', they seem to come out as univocal. For there does not seem to be anything odd about sentences like: God is wiser than any of us God is more loving than even our closest friends. Of course, special problems arise with some attributes: it seems odd to say, for instance, that 9Predicability', in Max Black (ed.), Philosophy in America (London: Allen and Unwin, i965) p. 263. 439</page><page sequence="10">Patrick Sherry God is better than this cabbage. But this is because 'good' is not a straightforward case: usually we want to ask 'a good what?' or 'good for what?' when told that something is good. It seems that here we cannot compare things of different categories (though, as we have seen, Aquinas regards all creaturely perfections as likenesses of divine goodness: cf. S.T. ia, Xiii, 2; xiv, 6; II Sent. 9, i, i ad 6). If, how- ever, by 'good' we mean 'morally good' then to some extent we can com- pare God and man: God is more loving, generous, patient, forgiving and so on than we are (on the other hand, we are faced with the point that some moral attributes, e.g. courage, chastity or gratitude, are not applicable to God, and with our general problem of what constitutes a perfection). We can reach similar conclusions about univocity by using other sentence frames, e.g. 'x is F, but y is not', or 'x and y are both F'. Again it does not seem improper to say: God is wise, but I am not. God and Job are both very patient. The latter is perhaps a trifle odd, but I think that this is due more to the suggestion of irreverence in such comparisons than to any logical impro- priety. The former seems perfectly allowable. G. Mavrodes makes a similar point in a slightly different way when he takes the sentence 'the being that St Francis loved above all else is wise'. and argues that since it is applicable whether the being in question is God or St Francis' mother, this suggests that there is a sense of 'is wise' which is neutral with respect to category.10 It should be noted that the converse of my thesis does not hold: an inability to compare two things does not necessarily entail equivocation. Quine has suggested that the reason why we cannot say 'the chair and the questions were hard' is the dissimilarity of the two things rather than the ambiguity of 'hard' (Word and Object, ?27). This example has been questioned by Sommers (loc. cit.), so let us take another one. We cannot say 'My argument is sounder than your floorboards', but this does not prove that 'sound' is equivocal. In the case of both arguments and floor- boards, despite categorical differences, 'sound' can be defined as 'free from defect' or 'properly constructed and so reliable', and can be contrasted with 'unreliable', 'weak', 'full of defects' and so on. I am inclined to think that 'sound' is one of those terms which embody what Cajetan called 'Analogy of Proper Proportionality', for we can compare different kinds of soundness thus: sound floorboards sound arguments their purpose and qualities their purpose and qualities' 10 'On Ross's Theory of Analogy', 7ournal of Philosophy 67, No. 20 (Oct. I970), pp. 747-755. 440</page><page sequence="11">Analogy Today The reason why we cannot simply say 'My argument is sounder than your floorboards' is that the two things have a different nature and purpose, different kinds of defects (dry-rot vs fallacies), and consequently different criteria of evaluation. I suspect that a similar analysis can be given to most evaluative terms-which is why I am unwilling to follow many recent commentators in depreciating this form of analogy, whilst agreeing that it contributes little to the particular question of divine attributes. Where comparison is possible, I am inclined to think that Scotus is right in insisting on univocity. Of course, there are going to be many borderline cases. Is 'God is stronger than Charles Atlas' inappropriate? It depends on what kind of strength is attributable to God, but most people, I think, would find this sentence odd. Or what about 'to have'? One can say 'I have a wife and six children, a mortgage, an overdraft, no job and little hope'. But there is a slight suggestion of zeugma here, and this no doubt led Aristotle to regard 'have' as a word with many senses (Categories, XV). I have not space to explore these difficulties, and anyway they do not affect my main points: that Scotus' approach often anticipates contem- porary work, that it causes many supposedly 'analogical' terms to fall away into the categories of 'univocal' and 'systematically equivocal', and that most of the traditional attributes of God, especially the moral ones, fall firmly into the univocal class. Certainly there seems to be something slightly odd in the Thomists' claim that we are 'stretching' even terms like 'wise' or 'know' when we apply them to God. For instance, Fr. Copleston writes: If we mean that God is wise in precisely the same sense that a human being is or can be wise, we make God a kind of superman, and we are involved in anthropomorphism ... the positive content of the concept in our minds is determined by our experience of creaturely wisdom, and we can only attempt to purify it or correct its inadequacies by means of negations.11 This is, I think, to anticipate non-existent difficulties. Just what is this 'precise sense' of human wisdom? And if there is such a thing, who ever supposed that it was to be ascribed to God? Presumably Copleston is think- ing of the facts that human wisdom has to be acquired through experience, is limited and can be lost. If indeed this is our concept of wisdom, we must apply the via remotionis. But it is not clear to me that these imperfections of human wisdom are built into our concept of 'wisdom' and are part of its meaning. Similarly with knowledge: it may be true that human know- ledge involves learning, is discursive, can be forgotten and so forth. But I do not think that any of these limitations are part of the meaning of the term 'know'. Again, the sentence-frame 'x knows that p' can be filled by 'God' or 'Smith' without any shift in the meaning of the term. And we 11 Aquinas (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, I955), pp. I29, I31. 29 44'</page><page sequence="12">Patrick Sherry can say 'I do not know when I shall die, but God knows' without any zeugma. At times Aquinas seems to half-realize that there is a sense of many terms like 'wise' or 'know' which is open and not restricted to any category, for he remarks that although 'sensus' cannot be ascribed to God because it is acquired physically, through sense organs, 'cognitio' has no such implication and so can be used of Him (I Sent. 22, I, 2)12, and he says that terms like 'being', 'good', 'life' and 'understanding' are attributable to God because no defect is included in their definition and they do not depend on matter (De Ver. II, i i; De Pot. VIII, 5 ad 8). But he does not draw the logical conclusion from these important remarks, with regard to the semantics of applying such terms to God. He is prevented from doing so, I believe, by his theory of meaning (unconsciously shared by Copleston) which leads him to link the meaning of words to intellectual concepts. For Aquinas the meaning ('ratio') of a word is a 'conceptio intellectus' of the thing signified by the word (S. T. i a, xiii, 4). Now since concepts are abstracted from 'phantasmata' derived from sensible things (S.T. Ia, xii, I3), it follows that our language is tied to our experience and represents material natures through the intermediaries of intellectual concepts. How, then, can we apply human language to God? Aquinas gets out of this difficulty by distinguishing between 'the mode of signification' which is learnt from creatures and befits them, and so is inapplicable to God, and 'the thing signified', e.g. perfections like 'goodness' and 'life' which belong to God properly (S.T. ia, xiii, 3, 6). The perfections of creatures are primary in the epistemological order but not so in the ontological order, because they flow from God's perfections. Now although we learn the meaning of words from natural things, our intellect is able to soar above the mode of signification and to ascribe to God the thing signified (De Pot. VII, 2 ad 7). This is, I suppose, one way of getting out of the difficulty. But perhaps we can avoid getting into it in the first place by making a careful distinction between the sense of words on the one hand, and the circumstances of their acquisition and the objects to which they normally refer on the other. Aquinas is prevented from really doing so by this theory of meaning, which links words and 'ideas', and is open to Frege's criticisms of 'ideational' theories of meaning (to use William Alston's description).13 If we abandon this theory we may be able to circumvent some of the problems which appear so formidable to Aquinas. If, for example, perfection-terms do not 12 This contrast is highly relevant to Kant's claim that we cannot attribute 'understanding' to God, because we can only conceive of an understanding like our own, which relies on the senses (Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, ?57). 13 Philosophy of Language (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, i964), pp. 22-25.

VIII, I; IX, 5. 442</page><page sequence="13">Analogy Today necessarily imply any limit, then the via remotionis and the via eminentiae can be seen as implicit in the use of such terms rather than as an extraneous procedure to be introduced in order to cope with the problem of God's attributes.14 Analogy and Arguments The question of meaning is an important one, for it leads us back to a common criticism, that analogical terms destroy arguments in which they are used. Aquinas himself was more concerned to describe God's attributes than to argue about Him in his use of analogical terms: he did, however, consider that this use avoids the Fallacy of Equivocation (S.T. ia, xiii, 5). His successors devoted a lot of attention to the problem. We have seen Scotus' answer. Cajetan argued that an analogous concept (ratio) is partially the same and partially different in its various uses, and that in Analogy of Pro- per Proportionality the sameness is provided by the identity of proportion. Hence he maintained against Scotus that analogous terms may be used legitimately in arguments, provided that only the element which is 'pro- portionally the same' in the terms used is operative. He gives the example of 'intellectual', arguing that if the immateriality of our souls entails their intellectuality we may conclude that God's greater degree of immateriality entails a greater degree of intellectuality (De Analogia Nominum, ? ?io6f.). This solution presumably applies only to Analogy of Proper Proportionality, which plays a predominant role in Cajetan's interpretation of Aquinas. It seems to be on the right lines in many cases: if I know that x is sound, I know that it is reliable, but not that it is free from dry-rot. Unfortunately, however, his promising logical approach is marred by Cajetan's 'ideational' theory of meaning, which leads him to devote a disproportionate amount of time to explaining how there can be a single analogical concept: he says that there is one imperfect mental concept, which implicitly represents all the natures giving use to the analogy, and as many perfect concepts as there are analogates; any concept perfectly representing one of two analogates will imperfectly represent the other (op. cit. ??36-8). We can avoid such contortions, I think, if we make a radical break with the tendency to view concepts as psychological entities and instead approach the matter by examining the truth conditions of judgments using analogical concepts. If the notion of fairness is an essential component of the concept of justice, then presumably a just God must at least give people their deserts and not be vindictive. Similarly with wisdom: a wise cat and a wise man 14 I take it that this is Fr. Burrell's view, in his interesting recent book, Analogy and Philosophical Language (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, I973). Unfortunately his anxiety to grind an anti-Scotist axe prevents him from critically evaluating Aquinas' theory of meaning. 443</page><page sequence="14">Patrick Sherry have some similarity with each other, in that they both pursue long-term goals, avoid foolish actions and learn from experience. Presumably a wise God has no need to learn from experience, but the other constituent notions are applicable to Him. Likewise, although there are, as I have suggested, different forms of love, they all at least desire the good of their objects and regret their misfortunes, otherwise they lose all claim to be called 'love'. This applies to God's love too, though the connection between love and self-sacrifice raises interesting questions about the impassibility of God and the two natures of Christ. 'Goodness', of course, raises special problems on which I have touched, though I think that some of the com- ponent notions of moral goodness, e.g. 'faithful' and 'merciful', can be dealt with in terms of truth conditions along the lines suggested. The other transcendentals are also difficult: God's mode of existence may be different from ours, but surely at least the existential quantifier is applicable to Him? The approach which I have suggested is not completely foreign to some of the things which Aquinas says. For instance, in De Potentia II, 5 ad 6 he argues that although the generation of God the Son and the formation of creatures are not univocally common, they are alike in that they 'accept'; hence His generation and our production may be placed under one common head. Similarly, he argues that 'light' is not used metaphorically when ascribed to the intellect, for it has the signification of 'manifestatio' in common with its physical use, and indeed in this sense light is more truly in spiritual things (II Sent. I3, I, 2).15 (Such common notions, however, differ from univocal ones like 'animal' according to Aquinas because in the latter case all the objects concerned participate equally in the term.) Presumably too the via remotionis and the via eminentiae are designed to ensure that the truth conditions for our ascription of predicates to God are not far different from those in the case of creatures. I think that this approach (which I have space only to sketch out very briefly) will go a long way towards meeting the objection. But does it amount to succumbing to a 'core of meaning' theory, which many Thomists (e.g. Burrell) find in Scotus and which they regard as incompatible with analogy? Well, it depends what you mean by 'core of meaning'. In a sense even Aquinas allows for this, as McInerny shows. And if 'sharing some (though not necessarily all) truth conditions' amounts to a 'core of meaning' theory, then I take it that some such theory is essential, otherwise we com- pletely divorce divine attributes from creaturely ones. But I think that my approach, by abandoning the search for a common mental concept and focusing more on judgments than on concepts, avoids the pitfalls here. 15 I owe these two references to R. McInerny, Studies in Analogy (The Hague: M. Nijhoff, I964), Ch. i. I have found this chapter very helpful on the point in question. 444</page><page sequence="15">Analogy Today An alternative approach would be to use what Wittgenstein says about 'criteria' and 'family resemblances' and to claim that there are a number of sufficient reasons for ascribing, say, love to someone, that these may differ from case to case, and that there is no one condition that is necessary on every occasion. Now this approach may suffice in the case of 'healthy', where there are obviously no truth conditions common to all our predica- tions of the term; but I do not think that it will do in the case of divine attributes since, as I have insisted all along, we do not want to make divine and human attributes related only in the way that two different kinds of game are. Moreover, I am inclined to think that in many cases, e.g. 'love', we must insist on a minimum common meaning, to be explicated in terms of the necessary truth conditions for statements containing the term. But we could only decide this question by examining each concept separately: some may have necessary conditions, some not, whilst in many cases the necessary conditions may themselves be analogical-I have suggested that this is the case with 'sound', whilst Aquinas defined 'good' in terms of a thing's being suitably disposed with reference to its nature (S. T. i a. 2ae, lxxi, i). We do not want a simple theory or a rigid format which we can force on our language: that would be just as restrictive as forcing the simple univocal/equivocal disjunction on to it. I do not know whether Burrell is right in arguing that Aquinas' teaching on analogy is more a set of strategies than a theory. But certainly this interpretation may be the most fruitful way of using this teaching as a contribution towards our investigation of all the different kinds of univocity and systematic equivocation to be found in our language. Analogy and Truth If we link the meaning of terms like 'love' to the truth conditions of sen- tences containing them, then we are inevitably led back to the epistemolo- gical and ontological questions which I earlier put on one side. It is not just a matter of saying that there must be some grounds for ascribing perfections to God. We must also insist that if we ascribe the same terms to God and creatures, then there must be a connection between the relevant criteria of evidence and truth. Thus the grounds for ascribing terms like 'love', 'father', 'exist' and 'life' must bear some relationship to the grounds used for our normal everyday applications of these terms. Similarly, even if 'God created the world' expresses a unique relationship, its truth conditions must bear some resemblance to our familiar uses of terms like 'make' or 'depend on' (which is not to say that we must expect to be able to verify the doctrine of the Creation empirically here and now). My qualified defence of analogy as a linguistic theory has done nothing to answer these questions or some of the other ones raised by Aquinas' 445</page><page sequence="16">Patrick Sherry ontology of a hierarchy of beings linked by relations of causation and parti- cipation. Of course, it is just at this point that criticisms of Aquinas directed to the views on causality which undergird his teaching about the analogical predication of God's attributes really begin to bite. To meet these criti- cisms we should have to defend Aquinas' Natural Theology, and also his general principle that a cause must possess in a greater degree the perfections of its effects. I shall not defend these views or seek for an alternative sup- port. I will, however, end by mentioning two philosophical problems which any theory seeking to provide such support must face, with regard to God's attributes: (a) In the case of creatures we ascribe moral attributes in virtue of actions: our evidence for saying that someone is loving and forgiving by nature is that he does love and forgive. Hence if we are to ascribe such attributes to God we must be able to identify examples of divine activity and thereby give concrete content to our predications. There is no point in describing God as merciful, loving and so on unless we can at least envisage what it is for Him to act with mercy, love and forgiveness.16 This point also, I think, applies to many other kinds of attributes, e.g. 'wisdom' or 'power'. We cannot drive a sharp wedge between God's nature and his activity or 'energies' in such cases. (b) We can only apply the via remotionis and the via eminentiae when we have found an appropriate starting-point. But this presupposes that we know what constitutes a perfection in general, and that we have decided which ones are applicable to God. Perhaps we cannot do our theology until we have got our ethics straight. But even then certain moral attributes will not be applicable, whilst non-moral ones like 'beauty' and 'knowledge' will have to be considered (I am ignoring ones like 'unity' and 'eternity', where the via remotionis and the via eminentiae are not relevant). These questions about God's attributes are far more intractable and difficult than that of analogical predication. But they underlie any use of the latter in religious contexts, and provide much of the importance and fascination of the topic.
