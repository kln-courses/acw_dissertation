WIJNGAARDS Oosterbeek Among the formulas expressing the Exodus happening the two most widely used are tr'in and ;5;W 1). The rigid form in which they have been shaped, their relation to certain legal and cultic traditions, their amazing universality throughout the Old Testament writings and their very contents justify another careful scrutiny2). What are the distinct features of either formula? Can either or both be connected to one of the acknowledged traditions? Could we retrace the development of the two formulas to their early origins? In the following brief outline we will first sketch the factual observations that can be made regarding either formula, and then attempt to reconstruct their origins, development and mutual relationship. 1. THE K"X1 FORMULA a) The formula has three fixed elements: the verb KrIn, the object (Israel or its equivalents) and the determination "from Egypt" (or its equivalents). Its original form may have been: =:3 .7 . QprP .RKin, "I liberated you from Egypt". In no less than eighty-three cases the classical Exodus from Egypt is recalled by means of this formula 3). Considering that the verb 'in, occurs 277 times in the Hebrew 1) See my study: The Formulas of the Deuteronomic Creed (abbrev. Formulas), Tilburg 1963 (obtainable from Brill, Leiden), pp. 23 ff. 2) The only publication directly concerned with these formulas (P. HUMBERT, ,,Dieu fait sortir. Hiphil de ydsa' avec Dieu comme sujet", Th.Z. XVIII 1962, pp. 357-361; ,,Note complementaire", ib. pp. 433-436) became known to me in the last phases of my investigation. The conclusions which I arrived at, will comple- ment, check and extend the research done by P. HUMBERT. 3) In my previous publication (Formulas, p. 23) three texts had escaped my attention: Ex. xiv 11 (P); 1 Kg. viii 21 (Dt) and 2 Chron. vii 22 (par. 1 Kg. ix 9). P. HUMBERT'S enumeration could be complemented with the following texts, where the Kgri formula has Moses or Moses and Aaron for its sub- ject: Ex. iii 10, 11, 12 (JE); Dt. ix 12 (Dt-Law); 1 Sam. xii 8 (Dt); Ex. vi 13, 26, 27 (P).</page><page sequence="2">J. WIJNGAARDS books of the Old Testament, more than a quarter of its use has been dedicated to express the Exodus happening! The rigidity of formulation may also be illustrated by the fact that out of the eighty-three formulas thirty-five are phrased in the "Ich-du Stil". b) To obtain a general picture of the formula's universality and its relation to various literary strands, this survey will be helpful: 1). J ( 6x): Ex. xiii 3, 9, 14, 16; xvi 32; Num. xxiv 8 E ( 4x) Ex. xx 2; xxxii 11, 12; Num. xxiii 22 JE ( 5x): Ex. iii 10, 11, 12; xviii 1; Num. xx 16 Pre-Dt ( 3x) : Jos. xxiv 5, 6; Jg. vi 8 Dt-Law (17x): Deut. v 6, 15; vi 12, 21, 23; vii 8, 19; viii 14; ix 12, 26, 28, 29; xiii 6, 11; xvi 1; xxvi 8, xxix 24 Dt ( 8x): Deut. i 27; Jg. ii 12; 1 Sam. xii 8; 1 Kg. viii 16, 21, 51, 53; ix 9. Add ( 2x) : Deut. iv 20, 37 Jer ( 5x): Jer. vii 22; xi 4; xxxi 32; xxxii 21; xxxiv 13 Ez ( 5x): Ez.xx6, 9, 10, 14,22 P (14x): Ex. vi 6, 7; vi 13, 26, 27; vii 4, 5; xii 17, 42, 51; xiv 11; xvi 6; xxix 46; Num. xv 41 HG ( 8x): Lev. xix 36; xxii 33; xxiii 43; xxv 38, 42, 55; xxvi 13, 45 Chr ( 2x) : 2 Chron. vi 5 (par 1 Kg. viii 16); 2 Chron. vii 22 (par. 1 Kg. ix 9) Late Pr/Ps ( 4x): Ps. cv 37, 43; cxxxvi 11; Dan. ix 15 It is clear from this survey that the formula lies embedded particular- ly in the legislative parts of the Old Testament. Moreover, legal traditions such as Dt-Law, P and HG employ it to an almost complete exclusion of the 5¥,*n formula (see part 2 b). Another striking feature of the 's'i formula is its absence among the early prophets (Isaias, Osee, Amos). These are significant facts that will have to be explained. c) The tlin formula expresses a strict liberation from slavery. The chronological note "from the day on which they left Egypt" rS 2) 1) With M. NOTH (Ueberlieferungsgeschichtliche Studien I, Halle 1943) I will distinguish in the "Deuteronomistic Work of History": Pre-Dt: preredactional matter and such later additions as are generally reputed old (Jos.xxiv); Dt-Law: the pre-redactional unit Deut. iv 44-xxx20; Dt: the redactor(s) of the whole work, and Add: later additions to the finished work of the redactor(s). 2) Ex. xvi 1; xix 1; Num. i 1; iv 1; xxxiii 1, 28; Deut. iv 45, 46; 1 Kg. vi 1; viii 9; etc. 92</page><page sequence="3">KIS'I AND 913# should not mislead us. rst itself is the technical term for the "going free" of a slave, the redemption of a land, the "being at liberty" of a divorced woman or of a prisoner 1). Although xr' may indicate the mere fact of departure or of origin, 2) it is inclined to connotate the departure from a place of bondage or oppression. Causative w'2t is in line with this development when it quite naturally ex- presses liberation from a prison 3). That wvti in the formula has the meaning of "setting free from slavery", can be deduced from the frequent addition: "from the house of slavery" (JE; Dt-Law; Pre-Dt; Jer)4), "from being their slaves" (P, HG) 5), "from the yoke of the Egyptians" (P)6) or "from that melting-pot of iron" (Add; Dt; Jer)7). Since these additions are found in all the literary layers that employ the formula, one is justified to consider them a normal feature of the formula itself. The addition is the authentic interpretation of the formula, explicitating the connotation of rescue 1) F. ZORELL, Lexicon Hebraicum et Aramaicum Veteris Testamenti, Roma 1957, pp. 321 f. 2) See Num. xxii 5, 11; xxvi 4 (referring to Israel); Deut. ii 32 (referring to the kaphthorim). 3) Gen. xl 14 (Joseph); Jer. lii 31 (Jechonias). 4) Ex. xiii 3, 14; xx 2 (JE); Deut. v 6; vi 12; vii 8; viii 14; xiii 6, 11 (Dt-Law); Jg. vi 8 (Pre-Dt); Jer xxxiv 13; the addition occurs twice with another formula than Nl-: Jos. xxiv 17 (with }l¥;i1); Mich. vi 4 (with t:') Q3s): II' will have meant quite concretely: "the slaves' quarters". Compare: .s D- nS, armoury (2 Kg. x 13); .; ,= n3, the palace (Ex. viii 20; 2 Sam. xi 2; 1 Kg. iii 1; etc.); .nwI.T n', the hall for drinking (Jer. xvi 8); _1n n'., the house of beervats, the public house (Prov. xxi 19: W.

The slaves' quarters of Egypt will have been a terrifying reality to all neighbouring peoples such as the Hebrews, an image of Egypt itself as land of captivity. 5) Ex. vi 6 (P); Lev. xxvi 13 (HG). 6) Ex. vi 6, 7 (P); note the transition from the concrete term to abstract slavery. 7) Deut. iv 20 (Add); 1 Kg. viii 51 (Dt); Jer. xi 4.

WIJNGAARDS inherent in the verb "'i"n itself.'Is it from this outstanding liberation from Egypt that K'vi becomes a favourite term applied to other liberating acts performed by Jahweh?l). d) The formula has been enlarged at times by the phrase "with a mighty hand and an extended arm" (Dt-Law; Ps) 2). Variations of this theme are: "with a mighty hand" (J; Dt-Law; Jer; Ez; Dan)3), "by the power of His hand" (J) 4), "with great judgements" (P) 5) and some other longer elaborations (Dt-Law; Add; Jer) 6). There can be little doubt about the interpretation of these phrases. They convey the powerful, miraculous manner in which Jahweh has liberated His people. Most likely they derive from the very graphic and anthropomorphic image of Jahweh at the Sea of Reeds: the arm stretched forward against the pursuing enemy, clenching His fist in wrathful indignation 7). It is fully in line with Israel's earliest belief that the liberation from Egypt was fought by a warlike intervention on the part of a militant God, Jahweh, who destroyed the armed forces of Egypt 8). We may infer from it that the 'xin formula was originally understood to refer directly to the liberating act at the Sea of Reeds, and only later extended to include Jahweh's series of signs and wonders performed in Egypt itself. e) Of special interest is the function which the K'xn formula assumes in relation to laws and prescriptions. In the most ancient record of written laws which the Old Testament contains, the deca- 1) See the complete survey in P. HUMBERT, I.C., pp. 358 f.; remarkable is the circumstance, apparently not observed by P. HUMBERT, that all the early pas- sages of K2sIH; having Jahweh (God) for its subject (I.c., p. 357: narratives preexiliques: 15 x; prophetiques preexiliques: 6 x; Deuteron., etc.: 26 x) are Exodus formulas (except Deut. viii 15: drawing water from the rock)! The later usage of R='ln with God as subject must be, if not derived from, at least be reminiscent of this exemplary liberation from Egypt. 2) Ex. xxxii 11 (E); Deut. v 15; vii 19; ix 29; xi 2 (Dt-Law); Ps. cxxxvi 12. 3) Ex. xiii 9 (J); Deut. vi 21; vii 8; ix 26; xxvi 8 (Dt-Law); Jer. xxxii 21; Ez. xx 34; Dan. ix 15. The same phrase occurs with the Htn formula (J: Ex. iii 19; Add: Deut. iv 34; xxxiv 12) and independently (JE: Ex. vi 1; Dt: Jos. iv 24). Moreover, not referring to the Exodus it is also used in Jahweh's war against His own people(Jer. xxi 5; Ez. xx 35) and about Edom's military forces (Num. xx 20). See H.

If children ask: "Why do we observe these laws?", they have to be instructed in the historical account of Jahweh's deeds 3). In this light it is a weighty observation that the wv;i formula, all by itself, rather often possesses the force of motivating either all laws in general (P; HG) 4), or of particular laws (J; Dt-Law; Dt; Add; P; HG). Regarding these latter ones it will cause no surprise to find that it was attached to the precept forbidding the cult of "other gods"-the main stipulation of the pact!! 5)-by the deuteronomistic authors (Dt-Law; Dt; Add) 6). We find it in the Paschal rite to explain the raison d'etre of the feast as a remembrance of Jahweh's liberation (J; Dt-Law; P) 7), just as the firstborn have to be dedicated to Jahweh since He spared them in Egypt (J) 8). Later the formula serves as motive-clause to such particular laws as: the prescriptions on the tabernacle (P)9), the demand for justice in trade (HG)10), prohibitions regarding the slavery of fellow-Israelites (HG) 11) and the ritual laws on the feast of tabernacles (HG) 12). Apart from the fact of this typically covenantal tendency to justify law by history, there is the noteworthy develop- ment from motivating the whole law (decalogue) and the main stipulation to functioning as motive-clause for particular prescriptions. 1) Ex. xx 2; Deut. v 6. W. ZIMMERLI, discussing the "Selbstvorstellungsformel" (in ,,Ich bin Jahwe", Festschrift A. Alt, Tiibingen 1953, pp. 179-209; cf. also: Erkenntnis Gottes nach dem Buche Ezechiel, Zurich 1954, pp. 58 ff.) has shown its relation to the pact. Since the very recalling of history in these matters owes its existence to the covenantal pattern (cf. Formulas, I.c., pg. 57), this selfpresentation as a historical God will derive from the historical prologue. Cf. W.

WIJNGAARDS The formula's relation to the covenant could hardly have been proved more convincingly. It needs further explanation why according to all legal traditions the function of justifying the law is attributed to the ,'xn formula all by itself. Why is it that-contrary to the ordinary scheme of the Heilsgeschichte which includes both Exodus and Landgiving ')-in so many cases the motivation of laws consists in a sole reminder of the liberation from Egypt without reference to the other outstanding benefit wrought by Jahweh: the Landgiving? 2) f) It would seem that the emin formula was only introduced into the Exodus-Landgiving scheme at a later stage. Some of the earliest independent texts containing the Exodus and the Landgiving do not employ the Ki;n formula (Ps; Am) 3). The Jahwistic-Elohistic account which is itself structured on the two themes of liberation from Egypt and conquest of the promised land, employs wsi, in but two of the eleven passages referring to the salvific history of these two themes combined 4). This is all the more telling as the svI1 formula itself is wellknown to JE (fifteen occurrences)! Perhaps the oldest records of sln; smoothly joined to the Land- giving theme are the two versions of the so-called Deuteronomistic Creed 5). In later passages recalling both Exodus and Landgiving the x"In formula is a regular feature (Add; Jer; Ez; P; HG; Ps) 6). One may deduce from these observations that simn did not originate in the Exodus-Landgiving scheme; rather it seems to have existed independently from this scheme and to have been introduced into it at a later stage. g) The 1min formula holds a key-position in the deuteronomistic scheme of the Heilsgeschichte.

The Landgiving is not so much a fact of the past as a future blessing dependent on fidelity to the pact 1). When Jahweh recalls the past to justify His claim on Israel, He refers to His saving interventions: "Did I not rescue stzhn you from Egypt, from the hands of the Amorites, Ammo- nites, Philistines, Sidonians, Amalecites and Midjanites when they oppressed you and you called out to Me?" 2). Foremost in priority of time and importance ranks the liberation from Egypt. At times the s1;n formula is employed referring to Egypt, and its synonym ¥'.;s or sin, referring to the other liberations 3).

In its original meaning it ex- presses the strict liberation from Egyptian slavery fought by Jahweh 1) Compare Jos. xxiii 13 ff. (Dt); 1 Kg. ix 6-9 (Dt). 2) Jg. x 11 f.; cf. Jos. xxiii 3-10; 1 Sam. x 18 f.; xii 6-11. 3) Jg. ii 11-19; 1 Sam. xii 8-12; for ¥.w as synonym of RK~Hl cf.: Ex. xviii 1-10 (JE); Jg. vi 8-9 (pre-Dt); Ex. vi 6 f.

Studien, l.c., sub textu). It seems to me a somewhat precarious procedure to admit "deuterono- mistic retouching of the matter" merely because of similar formulations. We must be open to the danger of using the formulas to distinguish "retouched matter" and then using this textual distinction to attribute formulas to certain authors. An example may be Jeremias, of which five of the RSTllH formulas are judged to belong to possibly deuteronomistic (Jer. vii 22; xi 4; xxxiv 13) or inauthentic (Jer. xxxi 32; xxxii 21) texts (cf. P. HUMBERT, I.C., pp. 357 f., who cites 0. EISSFELDT, Einleitung in das Alte Testament, Tiibingen 19562, pp. 503 f.). It would be interesting to know in how far the formulas themselves made O. EISSFELDT suggest these textual divisions. 5) Deut. i 27, cf. 30 (Dt); the almost exclusive use of R"lH by Dt-Law R'2;^l 17 x; ;157fY 1 x) will, next to the legislative character of the matter (cf. no 1 e), also be due to Ihe renewed theological appreciation of it by the Deuteronomists (P.

For Moses as subject, see Ex. iii 10-12 (J) and Deut. ix 12 (Dt-Law); for Moses and Aaron: Ex. vi 13, 26(P). 97 Vetus Testamentum XV 7</page><page sequence="8">J. WIJNGAARDS at the Sea of Reeds. It is peculiarly frequent in the legal traditions, functioning all by itself as a convenantal motive-clause. It enters the Exodus-Landgiving scheme of the Heilsgeschichte at a later stage, but seems to be treated as the first and exemplary formula by the deuteronomistic school, determining its conception of salvific history as a series of liberations. 2. THE .LnVl FORMULA a) Also this formula has three fixed elements: the verb rtn, the object (Israel or its equivalents) and the determination "from Egypt" (or its equivalents). We might reconstruct its original wording as: Q1:91. ZnDrn .1fpt, "I made you come (here) out of Egypt". There are forty-one cases of the formula referring to the classical Exodus from Egypt 1), of which seventeen are phrased in the "Ich-du Stil". b) The formula's distribution among the various literary strands will be illustrated by the following survey: 2) J ( 2x): Ex. xvii 3; xxxiii 12 E ( 5x): Ex. xxxii 1, 4, 7, 8, 23 JE ( 8x): Gen. xlvi 4; 1 24; Ex. iii 8, 17; xxxiii 1; Num. xvi 13; xx 5; xxi 5 Pre-Dt ( 6x) :Jos. xxiv 17; Jg. ii 1; vi 8, 13; 2 Sam. vii 6; 1 Kg. xii 28 Early Pr/Ps ( 6x): Os. xii 14; Am. ii 10; iii 1; ix 7; Mich. vi 4; Ps. lxxxi 11 Dt-Law ( 1 x) Deut. xx 1; Dt ( 5x): 1 Sam. viii 8; x 18; xii 6; 2 Kg. xvii 7, 36 Jer ( 4x): Jer. ii 6; xi 7; xvi 14; xxiii 7 P ( 2x): Lev. xi 45; Num. xiv 13 Chr ( 2x): 1 Chron. xvii 5 (par. 2 Sam. vii 6); Neh. ix 18 (cf. Ex. xxxii 4) Contrary to Klwi, the nfn formula is well attested in the pre- deuteronomistic and early prophetic texts. Although it certainly had its 1) The formula is applied to the future Exodus in Jer. xvi 15; xxiii 8; Ez. xxxvii 12, 13 (as a pun?). 2) I have included in this survey also the following passages in which Moses is the subject of the formula: Ex. xvii 3; xxxii 1, 23; xxxiii 12; (cf. Formulas, I.c., p. 23). Num. xxi 5 (JE) has both God and Moses for its subject (!); some Greek Mss. presuppose a variant reading of KtI11 in stead of l'fl 98</page><page sequence="9">KI"1l AND 91917 place even in the later years of the royal period (Dt; Jer), a tendency to omit it must have set in quite early. Dt-law has it only once; P twice; the Chronicler leaves it in an ancient oracle to David, but does not use it himself unless in a reference to the golden calf (Neh. ix 18). c) The formula is frequently enunciated in immediate connection with the coming to the land, at times explicitly by the addition "to this land" 1), at other times in circumstances that leave no doubt as to the same implication: His promise to Jacob 2), His rebuke to His own tribe in the land 3), the comparison with the Philistines and Amorites who also received a second, definite home from Jahweh 4). It would seem, therefore, that even when ;lwn is not followed by the ':n formula (expressing the "bringing to the land") 5), the reaching of this goal was implied 6). d) It is not difficult to discern the liturgical character of the formula. When appearing in the solemn proclamation by Jahweh, it is repeated- ly introduced by the prophetic (?) opening "So speaks Jahweh" 7), and it seems to employ the more solemn "'iR rather than the ordinary 'Kt 8). Moreover, it recurs in certain decidedly cultic exclamations: 1) Ex. iii 8, 17; Gen. 1 24; cf. Ex. xxxiii 1. 2) Gen. xlvi 4. 3) Am. iii 1-2. 4) Am. ix 7; cf. Am. ii 9-11; Jer. ix 4-7. 5) For the R'il formula, see Formulas, l.c., p. 31; the combination of ftBl and RI;B occurs in Num. xvi 12 ff.; xx 3-5 (JE); Jg. ii 1 (pre-Dt); Jer. ii 6-7. 6) Cf. M. NOTH, Oberlieferungsgeschichte des Pentateuch, Stuttgart 1948, p. 54, note 169; it is a tempting suggestion, that fl'7;#1 might express in some way an ancient Israelite conception of the route taken from Egypt at the Exodus: a long journey through the desert entering Palestine across the Jordan (E, Dt) or a direct entry through Qadesh (J)? cf. H. CAZELLES, "Les Localizations de l'exode et la critique literaire", R.B., LXII 1955, pp. 321-364; esp. pp. 360 ff.; J. MAU- CHLINE, "Gilead and Gilgal. Some Reflections on the Israelite occupation of Palestine" V.T. VI 1956, pp. 19-31; here esp. p. 24. It is interesting to note in this connection that 7flt does not only mean "to go up, to climb", but "to go to the north" (notably in such cases where a geographical descent is un- avoidable), cf. G. R. DRIVER, On "Went up country" (to the North) and Y-R-D "Went down country", Z.A.W. LXIX 1957, pp. 74-77; esp. pp. 74, 76. Yet, it would seem that the Israelites could not conceive a journey from the lowlands of Egypt to mountainous Palestine as anything else than an ascent, no matter what route be taken. 7) Jg. vi 8; 1 Sam. x 8; Am. ii 10; cf. also Am. ix 7; iii 1. It is probably more correct to ascribe the phrase to the "Bundesmittler" in these cases, cf. H. J. KRAUS, Die prophetische VerkXindigung des Rechts in Israel, Theol. Studien 51, Zurich 1957, pp. 23 ff. 8) Jg. vi 8; Gen. xlvi 4; 1 Sam. x 18; Am. ii 10; Ps. lxxxi 11. 99</page><page sequence="10">J. WIJNGAARDS "Behold, Israel, the God that brought you out of Egypt!!" 1); "Where is Jahweh who brought us out of Egypt?!" 2); "Didn't Jahweh bring us out of Egypt?!" 3), and the common adjuration "As sure as Jahweh lives who brought us out of Egypt!" 4). e) The formula must have been at home in the Northern Kingdom, particularly at the sanctuaries of Bethel and Dan. Osee and Amos testify to its existence as a sacred formula at their time 5). The Aaronic and Jeroboamic literally independent versions of how the cult of the golden calves was inaugurated at Bethel and Dan, record nh5y as the ritual formula employed 6). It can hardly be chance that the Chronicler recalls the same formula in connection with the golden calves (Nehemias' prayer) 7). It is this connection with the illegitimate cult of the Northern Kingdom that may have caused its gradual omission in the post-exilic writings (P; HG). Dt-Law has only one case of r7'mn in its collection of martial laws, a singular exception to its pronounced preference for ,rmin (seventeen occurrences!). May we suspect that the deuteronomists, too, had a dislike for ,'¥n on account of its association with the cult of the golden calves? Would this explain why Dt avoids ;nr n in his reflections on history, except in recalling the words of the "Northern" leader Samuel 8) and in his epilogue on the fall of the Northern Kingdom? 9) f) The ;*ywn formula seems to have functioned in the Exodus-Land- giving scheme of the Heilsgeschichte from the very start.

This assumption is con- firmed by JE which has four examples of bT*w functioning both as Exodus and Landgiving formula 1) and two cases where the rebellious Jews reproach Jahweh with His taking them (n;tn) from Egypt to desert land, and not to the promised land of plenty 2). For JE n'7n expresses the Landgiving as the natural sequel to the Exodus! The place of rn,tn in the Exodus-Landgiving scheme is, moreover, amply attested by such independent texts as various covenantal complaints uttered by prophets (Pre-Dt; Am; Jer; Mich) 3) and the people's acclamation of the pact at Sichem 4). The relation between the n-'*n formula and salvific history seen as a combination of Exodus and Landgiving would seem to lie in their common origin in the new covenantal situation after the conquest. g) Summing up our findings regarding the nbri;l formula, we may recall that the formula must have been at home especially in the Northern sanctuaries. It has a distinctly liturgical character. Although it is an Exodus formula, it has the aptitude to include the Landgiving. As such it seems to have functioned in the Exodus-Land- giving scheme of the Heilsgeschichte from the very start. Its associa- tion with the forbidden cult of the golden calves may be the reason why it was gradually avoided by later authors. 3. ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE TWO FORMULAS It would seem that the rxsi formula recalls directly the miraculous liberation at the Sea of Reeds. As such it reflects the historical title on which Jahweh could impose His covenant at Sinai. It is this juridico-historical function, which 'xir acquired from the Sinaitic pact, that it always retained in legislative traditions. The 'xr1i for- mula, however much ignored by the "Northern" prophets, must have had its origin in the earliest Sinaitic traditions. The ;nlyt formula, which visualizes the Exodus as culminating 1) Ex. iii 8, 17; xxxiii 1; Gen. 124. 2) Num. xvi 12-14; xx 3-5. 3) Jg. ii 1; vi 8 (pre-Dt); Jer. ii 6-7; Am. ii 9-11; Mich. vi 4; cf. J.

The new agricultural conditions of settlement which occasioned the adaptation of the covenantal stipulations, will have required an extension of the Heilsgeschichte (the historical prologue) from a mere Exodus to an Exodus resulting in the Landgiving. This new, covenantal scheme of the Heilsgeschichte, in which also the iin7 formula was introduced, became the classical conception of salvific history: a history that could be enlarged with the Urgeschichte, with patriarchal stories and many particular traditions, but that could never extend beyond the Landgiving. That the n50ni formula is gradually superseded by Kin; may be due to the theological pre- ference of the Deuteronomists for the latter term as well as the former's connotation with the forbidden cult of the golden calves at the Northern sanctuaries. A new concept of the Heilsgeschichte was developped by the Deuteronomists. The past Landgiving-made problematic in face of the exile-began to be understood rather as a continuous blessing, depending on Israel's fidelity to the pact, than an irrevocable divine deed. In this light Jahweh's salvific activity establishing His right to Israel's submission, was seen to be a series of liberations of which the Exodus, the liberation "par excellence", remained the outstanding example for all times. The well-known s';i formula was now seized upon again and made the starting-point to a true theology of election and redemption. Moreover, it became the key to understand- ing consequent history. Slavific history was appreciated to continue beyond the conquest as Jahweh's uninterrupted activity from the Exodus until present times. It is this new realization that gave rise to the redaction of the Deuteronomistic and Chronistic Works. This sketch of the origin and development of the two formulas involved some views on the Heilsgeschichte that merit further study. The analysis of K1rl and r75iYn may have helped us to discern better their own theological traits and their contribution to the rise and growth of the Heilsgeschichte. 102</page></plain_text>
