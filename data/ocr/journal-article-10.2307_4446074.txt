<plain_text><page sequence="1">Index to Volume 3 The index has three parts: subjects, titles, and authors. Alphabetizing is letter by letter (not word-by-word); for example, "Educational" would precede "Education theory." SUBJECTS Everything in Volume 39 is covered except filler items. This is a multiple index; that is, an item may be indexed in two or more places, to ensure access. Entries in the first part are keyed to sections of the Title index, as follows: A, articles; F, features; L, letters to the editor; and E, editorials. The number tells the issue number (no.) and page in the journal. You may go directly to the page, of course, or you may consult the Title index to discover whether the item is the one you are seeking. The second part of this subject index groups books reviewed in this volume by title. Authors and editors of books, not the reviewers) are mentioned in parentheses preceding the issue-and- page reference. Initial articles (a, an, the) of book titles have been dropped; that is, a title begins with its first sub- stantive word.

Grobman Teachers and students of life sci- ences are forced to consider the social implications of biology. The impor- tant issues can not be avoided and deserve a full and balanced discussion. Recognizing this need, the Nation- al Association of Biology Teachers invited distinguished biologists to ad- dress themselves to a variety of social issues. The result has been a volume ideally suited as a resource for class discussion and as a reference for the teacher of either life sciences or humanities. The volume includes chapters on the social implications of . . . Medicine by Michael and Lois DeBakey Behavior by James V. McConnell Genetics by Bruce Wallace Population by Garrett Hardin Evolution by Claude A.
