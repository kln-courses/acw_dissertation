This dissertation examines close relationships among the ideas of self, language (particularly personal pronouns), and metaphysics. The relation- ship is not a causal one but involves semiotic mediation. If the idea of self differs in different cultures, is it not the case that the idea of the divine also differs? In order to shed some light on this correlation between the ideas of God and self, the author focuses on the ideas of "pure experience" of William James and Kitaro Nishida as well as a new typology of subject- prominent and topic-prominent languages. Although Nishida took the term "pure experience" from James, the content of this idea differs significantly in the work of each. The reason is partly related to their different under- standings of unity. Behind the different interpretations of "pure experience" the author sees the two different types of culture, language, and the idea of self as semiotic *Harvard Theological Review periodically includes summaries of Harvard doctoral dis- sertations recently accepted in the Th,D. and Ph.D, programs under the Committee on the Study of Religion, a standing committee of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with membership from both that faculty and the Faculty of the Divinity School, Relevant theses from the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization (NELC) are also included.

These different types of culture are: "Divine type A" (God the mother) which is characterized by the mother-child relationship as a prin- cipal symbolization of its culture (Japan and the topic-prominent language) and "Divine type B" (God the father) which is characterized by the father- child relationship as a principal symbolization of its culture (the United States and the subject-prominent language). The former tends to foster a metaphorical understanding of self as a place or a field, while the latter tends to foster a metaphorical understanding of self as a substance or will. The author argues that both James and Nishida tried to incorporate both "Divine type A" and "Divine type B" in their philosophies. Nevertheless, Nishida and James were still influenced by their culturally defined ideas of God. Nishida recognized two directions of self-transcendence: the one involves external transcendence (in Christianity) and the other immanent transcen- dence (in Buddhism). The author argues that these two different directions of self-transcendence are closely related to the different metaphorical un- derstandings of self (thus the different self-reflexivity). Consequently, the author suggests that there are considerable interactions between theology, semiotics, and rhetoric. g Paula Kane Robinson Arai [Ph.D.] Zen Nuns: Living Treasures of Japarlese Bud&amp;sm. This study explores the history and patterns of life of Japanese women in monastic Soto Zen Buddhism, a religious movement that has flourished in Japan since the thirteenth century. Despite the fact that academics of Zen Buddhism have treated the religion as though it were only a male monastic tradition, original historical and anthropological research reveals the expe- rience of female monastics in modern Japan to be at stark variance with that of their male counterparts. Zen nuns maintain the practices espoused by Dogen (1200-1253), the founder of Soto Zen in Japan. Although aca- demics are divided over the significance of Dogen's egalitarian teachings, Soto nuns are not. In the twentieth century they were not daunted by the male-dominating authorities that circumscribed their lives. On the contrary, with the knowledge that their founder supported women, Zen nuns fought relentlessly with the Soto sect administration. In a few decades they suc- ceeded in institutionalizing equality into all sect relations. Reflecting upon the historiographic and interpretive issues involved in scholarship on the history of women and on women's religious practices is an integral aspect of the quest to restore women's contributions to the content and history of Zen Buddhism. Through the original documents and historical texts I procured, the history, practices, and recent advances of Zen nuns are emerging. Based upon information I gathered from an ex-</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 479 tended period of participant-observation in a Zen monastery for women, extensive interviews, and responses to my nation survey of female monastics, I present the first scholarly examination of the lives and self-perceptions of Zen monastic women. My work offers an overview of their personal back- grounds, motivations, religious values, spiritual practices, perceptions of society's views of them, attitudes toward male monastics, thoughts on so- cial responsibility, and self-reflections on life as a Zen nun. In the face of competing impulses coursing through modern Japanese society, Soto Zen nuns choose to maintain a traditional monastic lifestyle, not allowing the currents of modernity to dilute their religious commitment. This study explicates the dual role of Soto Zen monastic women as pre- servers of religious and cultural traditions and as active participants in the progressive movement for the independence and equality of women. g Stanley R. Azaro [lll.D.] The Effiics of National Service knplementabon: Moral Dimensions of the Public Policy Debate. A long-standing public policy debate about the idea of launching a com- prehensive national service system in the United States has recently trans- lated into significant legislation and the initiating of a fledgling program. What would constitute a morally acceptable and responsible approach to national service? In responding to this issue, this dissertation attempts to break important ground in applying principles of Christian social ethics to the public policy debate. But what precisely is national service? To help answer this question, the first part of the dissertation presents a survey of significant national service theories, models, legislative proposals, programs, and precedents since the turn of the twentieth century, with emphasis on the developments of the last several decades. Here the methodology is predominantly historical and descriptive so as to enable the reader to acquire some sense of the critical national service problems and issues that recur over the years. The over-all impression given is that national service has exhibited a great diversity of meanings and approaches during its history and that perhaps this has been to its advantage. What are the moral dimensions of the public policy debate? The second part of the dissertation undertakes both a normative analysis of the preced- ing material and its own constructive moral argument. The moral logic employed proceeds from arguing for a moral obligation of citizenship to serve the common good to an argument that national service,- if imple- mented in accord with certain practical norms, would be an appropriate social structure of institution for mediating the civic responsibility. As part of the constructive argument, the third chapter develops a set of mediating principles derived from Christian social ethics, which results in what is</page><page sequence="4">480 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW called a contributive model of citizenship, based as it is on the concept of contributive justice. A unique aspect of the dissertation's argumentation is its application of the relatively little-known principle of subsidiarity to the national service debate in order to clarify the proper scope and limit of the government's role in national service. The principle of subsidiarity can also provide a basis for responding to objections raised against national service from re- ligious circles. Generally, a comprehensive yet pluralistic and localized approach to national service in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity is proposed. The treatise concludes with a set of specific public policy recommendations consistent with the mediating principles and practical norms of the analytic section. g Ariur F. Buehler [Ph.D.] Charisma arld Exemplar: Naqshba Spintual Authont in the Punjab, 1857-1947. The problem addressed in this study is the charismatic authority of Sufi shaykhs in Islam over the past millennium, specifically why their followers have voluntarily and unquestioningly put themselves in the hands of a spiritual mentor (commonly called a shaykh or pir) "as a corpse in the hands of the corpsewasher." To approach this issue, this study outlines the sources of charisma that have developed within the Islamic tradition and explains how a particularly influential Indian Sufi group, the Naqshbandiyya, has utilized these charismatic sources for religious and political change. By the fifth/eleventh century, Sufi shaykhs developed the informal but recognizable institution of the educator-shaykh in Sufism. As self-proclaimed "heirs of the Prophet," such shaykhs strove to preserve Muhammad's char- ismatic authority. by the eleventh/seventeenth century Naqshbandi shaykhs acted within this framework as teacher-exemplars who educated their dis- ciples in rigorous Sufi exercises designed to allow one to experience inti- macy with God. Mir Dard (d. 1199/ 1785) of twelfth/eighteenth-century Delhi along with Shah Waliullah (d. 1175/1785) and Mazhar Janjanan (d. 1195/1781) emphasized the "Muhammadan Path," which encouraged ven- eration and emulation of the Prophet. This situation continued through the thirteenth/nineteenth century. In fourteenth/twentieth century British colonial India, however, the sources of Naqshbandi legitimacy changed radically. Naqshbandi shaykhs, as me- diators between believers and Muhammad, abandoned the teaching and practice of the Naqshbandi spiritual discipline, putting all their stress in- stead on the love of the spiritual mentor and the Prophet as the means to God. Paradoxically, Muhammad and God became more hierarchically re- moved from believers as love and devotion of the shaykh brought these</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 481 believers into a more intimate relationship with the Prophetic sources of the tradition. Such shaykhs, whom I shall term mediator-shaykhs, have become the norm in contemporary Pakistan. Even though educator- and mediator- shaykhs did not utilize identical charismatic sources, Muslims have consid- ered both paths to lead to God. This study seeks to explore how the varied combination of these sources rejuvenated charisma in Islam. g Robert E. Goss Ltlwh.D.] The Henneneutics of Madrless: A Literary and Henneneutical Analysis of The Mi-la-ra*-pa 'i-rnam- thur by GtsaIlg-smyon He The present study examines the Mi-lati-rnam-thar, a fifteenth-century Tibetan religious classic. The narrative traditions of Mi-la have a complex vector of literary development through oral and written sources over three and a half centuries. Gtsang-smyon Heruka compiled and edited the narra- tive traditions into the collected songs (mgur- bum) and the rnam-thar. The main argument of this dissertation is that Gtsang-smyon composed the rnam- thar with a reformist intent. He portrayed the poet-saint Mi-la as a mad saint to justify the mad saint movement (smyon-pa) in Tibet. The traditional and historical-critical interpretations of the Mi-lati-rnam- thar do not sufficiently unpack the potential of the text as a religious classic. Aporias do emerge and remain unexplained: the social context of the text, the oral hermeneutics, the conflation of shamanistic and tantric traditions, the intent and genius of Gtsang-smyon. The traditional-and his- torical-critical frameworks fall short, failing to understand the dynamic nature of the Mi-la'i-rnam-thar. The rnam-thar genre concerns hermeneutics in action, the transmission of enlightenment from lama to disciple. Ricoeur's writings on hermeneutics, metaphor, and narrative provide a horizon to appreciate the potential of Gtsang-smyon's rnam-thar. Ricoeur's writings provide a framework that comprehends the configuration of the lama/disciple relationship within the text, the oral hermeneutics of Tibetan Buddhism, the refiguration of the Mi-la'i-rnam-thar into other cultural media and the text of one's life. Ricoeur's notion of the unmooring of the text or the negation of the ostensive reference allows for new hermeneutical appro- priation within the world of the reader. Hermeneutical analysis of the Mi- la'i-rnam-thar opens the text to understanding that is dynamic and reflective of its development within Tibetan Buddhism. The hermeneutics of the Mi-la'i-rnam-thar is a hermeneutics of mad- ness. Madness is a symbol of transcendence. Gtsang-smyon's hermeneutics of madness is grounded in the application of the Buddhist notion of the two truths and the tantric contemplative imagination. The public behavior of the mad saint is similar to the semantic impertinence of the metaphor. The mad saint stands outside of the social conventions. His behavior is both liminal</page><page sequence="6">482 HARVARD TH EOLOG I CAL REVI EW and ludic; it presents a critical and innovative alternative set of values. Gtsang-smyon uses the portrayal of Mi-la as a mad saint to present a critical alternative to the monastic ideal. He attempts to revive the founding ideals, teachings, spirituality, and practice as displayed in the life of Mi-la- ras-pa. Gtsang-smyon believed in their imaginative capacity to inspire re- form. g Dale Jonaffiarl Gneser [ Ill.D.] Seducers of ie Simple Folk: The Polemical War Against Anabaptism. Anabaptism challenged religious and political leaders of the early six- teen century, evincing many responses as governments and churches sought to control or extirpate the movement. In a new age of culture, reformers and Catholic publicists published pamphlets in which they refuted Anabaptist positions and defended their own positions. While scholars have not ignored this literature, their affection has fo- cused on the theological debate and on the work of the great reformers: Zwingli, Bullinger, Luther, Melanchthon. These men helped to set the terms of debate and to establish their confessions' responses to Anabaptism. This literature, Catholic and Protestant, is a rich source for our understanding of sixteenth-century social, political, and religious values. Although most of the polemic focuses on theological and exegetical controversy, underneath these disputes lies a rich vein of rhetoric and argument that reveals much about the polemicists' assumptions concerning society and church. These assumptions about the nature of society and church separated the Anabaptists from their opponents, incited their fears, and encouraged the movement's suppression. I examine how publicists and reformers responded to the Anabaptist threat before 1540. They viewed Anabaptists as Satan's servants competing with them for the souls of the common people and as revolutionaries at- tacking societal and political order. They interpreted every aspect of Anabaptist teaching in light of these assumptions. Adult baptism under- mined parental authority and societal unity. Their rejection of the oath undermined government, divided communities, and set neighbor against neighbor. Anabaptist teachings on community of goods and tithe resistance were viewed as attempts to rekindle peasant unrest. Their rejection of civil and religious authority undermined traditional lines of authority and the religious institutions being developed by reformers. The Anabaptist King- dom of Munster exceeded the worst fears of Anabaptism's opponents and compelled a reassessment of the forces behind Anabaptism and its appeal to the common people.</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 483 This dissertation contributes to our understanding of sixteenth-century society and religion and underscores recent trends in Anabaptist research that reemphasize the revolutionary threat of Anabaptism and its link to the Peasants' War. It reveals the presuppositions that shaped official attitudes toward the Anabaptists and helped configure societal and religious institu- tions in a time of great religious and societal change. g Margaret E. Guider LM.D.] The Church of Liberation asld e Problem of Prostitution: A BraziSiasl Case Study. This dissertation explores the practical theological implications of ecclesial reflection upon the phenomenon of prostitution. Particular attention is given to a contemporary case study of the church in Brazil and its efforts to address the plight of growing numbers of prostitutes in the largest Roman Catholic country in the world. The introduction provides an explanation of the method, a survey of the background resources and a presentation of the principles and foundations that undergird the research. Chapter one proposes the retrieval of the nar- rative of Rahab the Harlot (Josh 22:1-21; 6:22-25) as a starting point for theological reflection on the prostitute as an exemplar of faith (Heb 11:31) and justice (Jas 2:25), and as a model for the church. Chapter two traces the evolution of prostitution within Brazilian society over the course of five centuries. Chapter three examines the contemporary construction of prosti- tution as an ecclesial problem by Roman Catholic bishops, pastoral agents, and theologians throughout Brazil. It tracks the rise and fall of ecclesial efforts to address the problem of prostitution in accord with an evolution- ary stage theory derived from the field of social psychology. Chapter four takes the analysis a step further by employing an ecological approach to understanding the interactive dynamics involved in the selection, definition, competition, survival, and suspension of the problem of prostitution within the ecclesial arena. Chapter five suggests the need for a reconsideration of the theological foundations that undergird the church's understanding of mission and ministry in the world church. To this end, it advances a the- ology of incarnate presence using insights derived from John Duns Scotus and Gabriel Marcel. This theological proposal affirms the importance of ministries of presence, particularly in the underworld of the world church. In the conclusion, this dissertation explores the feminine face of the church as prostitute and offers a brief reflection on the meaning of the New Evan- gelization from the vantage point of the prostitute.

This dissertation examines the religious practices and manifestations of maternal imitatio Mariae from its Blutezeit in the fourteenth century to its attenuation in the first quarter of the sixteenth century. It focuses on textual and visual evidence from late medieval Germany where the sources are especially rich and uniquely coherent. Maternal imitatio Mariae is under- stood to be the imitation of characteristics and qualities reflective of Mary's relationship to her son. The thesis explores how Mary's role as mother of the infant, the child, and the adult Christ was mirrored in the experiences and visions of religious virtuosi and how it helped to shape religious prac- tices for ordinary worshipers in late medieval Germany. After an introduction which includes a translation of Margaretha Ebner's narration of miraculous lactation, presented as a model episode along with a brief commentary, the second chapter outlines certain methodological considerations necessary for writing a "thick description" (Geertz) of a medieval religious practice. The chapter comprises a cross-cultural discus- sion of the religious practice of imitatio, remarks on the value of contem- porary performance theory for an examination of medieval imitatio Mariae, and a survey of relevant scholarship (Bynum, Klapisch-Zuber, etc.). Chap- ter three surveys images of imitatio Mariae that preceded the fourteenth- century Blutezeit, examining evidence from Saint Augustine to Saint Francis. The analysis of maternal imitatio Mariae as "mother mysticism" is treated in chapter four along with a discussion of the role played by the cura monialium. Using evidence form representational art and religious drama, chapter five attempts to reconstruct the practice of imitatio Mariae for ordinary worshipers. Together chapters four and five explore the similari- ties and distinctions between imitatio Mariae experienced by cloistered women privately seeking unio mystica and public performances of cradle- rocking and Marian laments. Throughout the thesis evidence is assembled to demonstrate the nature and extent of imitatio Mariae in late medieval Germany. g JonaFan Roy Hennasl [Ph.D.] The Text of "Chuaslg Tzu" and the Problem of Intexpretation: A Cntical Study of Mardn BubeWs Translation and Comrnentaxy. This thesis offers a sinological perspective on Martin Buber's much overlooked Reden und Gleichnisse des Tschuang-tse (Talks and Parables of Chuang T:u), his 1910 translation of and commentary on Chuang T:u, one</page><page sequence="9">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 485 of the oldest classics of the Taoist tradition. It is here demonstrated that Buber's work represents not only a transitional stage between his early Hasidic studies and later dialogical writings Buber completed the first draft of Ich und Du (I and Thou) in 1916 but also a significant contribu- tion to the longstanding sinological task of interpreting the text of Chuang Tzu. This project includes annotated English translations of both the text and commentary portions of Buber's volume, as well as critical analyses integrating Bubers work into the modern sinological discourse. The point of departure is the complex interpretive history of the Chinese text itself, and how Bubers unique interpretive perspective bring crucial hermeneutic challenges to light. The integrative chapters of the thesis illustrate the heuristic value of Buber's text with respect to three hermeneutic models-historical recon- struction, interactive interpretation, and aesthetic reception which are de- termined by the demands of the document at hand and the rigors of modern literary theory. Taken comulatively, the conclusions produced in these chap- ters carry important ramifications for three scholarly disciplines. First, they charge Buber scholars with revising their understanding of the philosophi- cal antecedents to the dialogical principle. Second, they demonstrate the need for sinologists to develop a new hermeneutic self-consciousness in certain areas of textual analysis. Finally, they urge scholars in the study of mysticism to reconsider the possibilities for sound comparative investiga- tions. g William Stacy Johnson, Jr. [Ph.D.] God e Center of Theology: A Reintexpretation of Karl Bari. There is a "theocentric" thread woven throughout the tapestry of Karl Barth's theology, which accents the prior mystery and hiddenness of God. This theme, which is evidenced in the way Barth employs the metaphor of the open "center" radiating in all directions to express God's resistance to straightforward depiction as well as God's relationship to all that is, calls onto question standard readings of Barth's work as "neoorthodox" or "christocentric." Barth is not "neoorthodox" because neither God nor the Christian Credo constitutes a fixed and unrevisable basis for cognitive certainty; they are not a "given." Although he is confident in the reality of God, Barth also posits an inescapable fallibility to all theological claims, which prompts theology always, in antifoundationalist fashion, to "begin again at the beginning." Nor is Barth "christocentric." Although Jesus de- fines the Christian concept of God by expressing the reiterated being of God in act, the concept of God, nevertheless, forever transcends Jesus. One may develop myriad portraits of who Jesus is as God which never exhaust who God is in Jesus. Barth elaborates God's being-in-act in Jesus Christ</page><page sequence="10">486 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW through an antisubstantialist and dynamic Trinitarian conceptuality, draw- ing upon the ancient conviction that everything proceeds from God and return to God. Barth seeks both to preserve God's prior actuality vis-a-vis the world and to bring relationality and historicity into the doctrine of God while also trying not to reify traditional ways of speaking to God. The central meaning of the divine-human history reflected in Jesus is that God is "for humanity." Barth's depiction of this history oscillates between "re- alism" and "constructivism," between the twin horizons of the world "as it is" and the world "as it ought to be." Although Barth does not argue for this explicitly, ethics seems to constitute the sphere of life that bridges the gap between realism and constructivism and provides a pragmatist way of validating the presuppositions of theology through action. This antifoundationalist, antisubstantialist, and pragmatist interpretation of Barth enables a constructive appropriation of his theology for today. g John R. Lanci [Ph.D.] Building a Temple of God: Paurs Metaphor of ie CoITununibr as a Temple in its Romarl Corinffiian Context. This dissertation examines the role that the temple/community image in 1 Cor 3:16-17 plays in Paul's argument in 1 Corinthians. It suggests that, rather than inviting the Corinthians to understand themselves as a new temple replacing the one in Jerusalem, Paul uses a metaphor that both Gentile and Jew could understand to introduce the motif of community upbuilding that runs throughout the letter. In chapter one, I examine previous interpretations of this text, and find the work done to date wanting in several respects. I propose that Paul's temple reference speaks to Jew and Gentile alike and that the image of the temple functions as part of a wider argument against dissension within the community. Through the presentation of historical and archaeological material, I demonstrate in chapter two that the letter is written to people living in a thriving Roman port that was a center of diversity and economic activity, including a great deal of building construction. In chapter three, I turn to 1 Corinthians and discern through structural and rhetorical analysis that Paul's stated purpose is to address what he sees as the problem of dissension within the community. In 1 Cor 3:16-17, Paul alludes to a temple in the context of building imagery. In chapter four, I examine in detail the use of construction lan- guage in 1 Corinthians. This chapter contains a rhetorical analysis of the structure of the letter and concludes that the language of construction is critical to Paul's argument in favor of building up the community.</page><page sequence="11">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 487 With the significance of construction language established, chapter five turns to the phenomenon of ancient temples. It demonstrates that in each of three major religious traditions present in fifth-century Corinth (Jewish, Greek, and Roman), certain temples (called herein "state temples") play a similar function as emblems of identity to those within specific groups. Chapter six focuses upon 1 Cor 3:16-17 and its context, demonstrating that, with the temple allusion, the verses present an active visual image that anchors and enriches the more primary images of the community as a building and a body. The study concludes with an epilogue, reflecting upon how what has been discovered may be applied to a modern Christian community. g Rachel F. McDermott [Ph.D.] Evidence for e Trarlsformation of e Goddess Kali: Kamalakanta Bhattacalya arld e Bengali Sakta Padavali Tradition. This is a study of the transformation of the Hindu goddess Kali and Uma, based on fieldwork conducted from 1988 to 1990 in West Bengal, India. The central concern is the influence of bhakti, or the devotional attitude, in altering perceptions of Hindu deities and their famous poet- saints. Divine and human figures once understood to be fierce, severe, or inaccessible become, through the perspective of devotion, softened, elevated, and popularized. Specifically, this study focuses on Kali and Uma as pre- sented in the eighteenth- to twentieth-century Bengali devotional poetry tradition, Sakta Padavali. A survey of the literary genre, with especial at- tention to its early innovators, demonstrates that the depictions of Kali and Uma have changed over time in the direction of increased sweetness and beneficence. Methodologically, this dissertation follows a "text in context" approach: conclusions reached through examinations of texts are tested by recourse to fieldwork in modern India. The thesis has three foci. The first is the biographic construction and poetic output of the "number two" poet in the Sakta Padavali tradition, after the more famous Ramprasad Sen (ca. 1718-1775): Kamalakanta Bhattacarya (ca. 1769-1820). A translation and discussion of his poetry forms the backbone to this study. The second of the foci is the larger poetic tradition of which he was an outstanding representative, the Bengali Sakta Padavali genre. Kamalakanta is compared with his predecessors and followers in this literary tradition, enabling a broad survey of developments in the depictions of Kali and Uma. A significant result of this literary review is the discovery that by the twentieth century, Kali, in particular, is presented in increasingly sweet and innocuous terms, in tones of reverence quite distinct from the daring intimacy characteristic of Ramprasad, and, to</page><page sequence="12">488 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW a degree, of Kamalakanta. The third focal point of this study is the modern context for this Sakta poetry; trends in the iconographic portrayal of the goddess, changes in the practice of animal sacrifice at Kali temples, and information gleaned through interviews in Calcutta and its environs all act as contextual corroborating evidence for the process of transformation charted through the literary analysis of the poetry. g Kimberly C. Patton [Ph.D.] When The High Gods Pour Out Wine: A Paradox of an Ancient Greek Iconography in Comparafive Context. A group of ancient Greek vase-paintings dating from 510-450 BCE has challenged interpretive efforts. The vases depict Olympian gods making votive offerings without any visible recipient. A catalogue and iconographic analysis include typological distinctions: libation versus animal sacrifice; altar-directed spondai versus chthonian choai. Relevant ancient literary evidence is evaluated, and previous scholarship on the topic is critiqued. Modern classicists have assumed normative boundaries between the di- vine and human realms in ancient Greek religion; but to whom are these gods offering? The vases show that the Greek gods, anthropomorphic to an extreme, could participate in every human behavior-not excluding worship itself. Should some mystical identification of roles between devotee and deity be newly inferred? Or is this better understood as an ideal paradigm for human worship? Among possible solutions are (1) the "humanization" of the gods; (2) sacrifice to a higher deity; and (3) atonement for the overthrow of a previous divine generation. Ultimately these prove inad- equate. A new phenomenology is proposed: the divine was seen in ancient Greece as the source of cult, rather than exclusively as its object. Not only the instruments of cult but cultic actions as well were attributed to the gods. The concept, designated in this work as "divine reflectivity," depends on a paradoxical reversal of canonical sacrificial categories. The closest parallel to the Greek case may occur in Vedic religion, in which the gods continually assume sacerdotal roles; sacrifice has no nec- essary object, but is itself a foundational ritual action that sustains the cosmos. In other religious traditions, both polytheistic and monotheistic, the paradox of a '4worshiping deity" emerges as a rare but crucial cultic structure. Specific and often doctrinally endangered forms of worship were emphasized at certain times in religious history by portraying the highest gods as enacting them. The question, "To whom do the gods offer?" be- comes irrelevant in that it applies human categories to divine subjects. From the standpoint of the traditions themselves, the phenomenon is best understood as an expression of original divine essence and power.</page><page sequence="13">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 489 g Luis R. Rivera Rodriguez [IE.D] Anthropogenesis: The Theological Anffiropology of Leonardo Boff. This dissertation makes a contribution by providing an in-depth discus- sion of Leonardo Boffss theological anthropology as an introduction to his theology. In particular it presents a systematization and interpretation of his contribution in the area of method in theological anthropology. My main proposal is that Boff has radicalized a progressive modern Catholic theological anthropology by introducing a Franciscan, liberationist, and Latin American perspective. I call anthropogenesis Boffss idea of a permanent genesis of humanity within the evolutionary process and in the course of history that leads toward the emergence of a new and fully developed humanity and a just and free society as the result of both God's grace and liberating action on behalf of humanity, particularly the poor and oppressed, and also humanity's struggle for integral liberation. This new humanity, proleptically revealed and realized in Jesus Christ, Mary, and Saint Francis, should now be gen- erated under the limiting conditions of finitude, sin, injustice, and death by a faithful, free, and loving interpersonal and political praxis that can de- velop the fundamental human relationships through the development of a socioeconomic and cultural democratic society, an ecological democracy, and a democratic Christianity in openness to God-Trinity. Chapter one provides a general framework for understanding Boffss writings by specifying his sociohistorical, ecclesial and theological context. Chapters two through four present my own systematic reconstruction of his ontology and understanding of sin, salvation, and liberation in the context of his Franciscan spirituality. Chapter five challenges the opinions of North American theologians who argue that Latin America liberation theology lacks a theological anthropology. Chapter six discusses several method- ological limitations in Boffss anthropology in light of his newest theological and political agenda. g Tyler Tillinghast Roberts [Th.D.] AsceXcism and AfElination: Nietzsche's Relevarlce as Religious Thinker. My dissertation analyzes two central concepts-asceticism and affirma- tion-with which Nietzsche criticizes Christianity and from which he con- structs a new religious vision. I explore the relevance of this vision for theology and philosophy of religion. Nietzsche argues that Christianity and metaphysics are based on the "ascetic ideal," an ideal that identifies ulti- mate value with spirit and being and devalues nature and becoming. This ideal promises the escape from human suffering on the condition that hu- man beings deny life's rootedness in nature and becoming. In contrast,</page><page sequence="14">490 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Nietzsche offers a vision of Dionysian affirmation of mundane, embodied life that gives new meaning to suffering. Yet, Nietzsche also claims that human nature is "uncanny," rooted in a "bad conscience" that leaves the human spirit in perpetual self-conflict. To affirm life, therefore, means af- firming the spirit's self-alienation and the accompanying suffering of self- creation. Nietzsche's affirmation requires a disciplined enactment of self-alienation, a "naturalized asceticism" in which one imposes "great suffering" upon oneself. Employing recent studies of asceticism that con- strue asceticism as a vital "practice of the self," I argue that Nietzsche is tied to the ascetic tradition he criticizes and that constructing his discipline of self-creation as ascetic practice reveals the curious interplay of negation and affirmation in his thinking. Nietzsche's asceticism maintains and spiri- tualizes the tensions in self and thought between meaning and meaningless- ness, suffering and joy. Focusing primarily on Zarathustra and Ecce Homo, I argue that a transfigurative spiritualization, based on an ecstatic experi- ence of eternal recurrence, allows Nietzsche to move beyond ressentiment to an affirmation of both the suffering and joy of life. In turn, this joy sacrifices itself in creative giving and returns to suffering and striving. I explore some of the religious qualities and theological implications of Nietzsche's asceticism and affirmation. Explaining in particular the work of Paul Tillich, I suggest that Nietzsche's criticisms do not adequately charac- terize Christian forms of affirmation, but that his affirmation raises impor- tant questions about the way theologians have understood ideas such as self-surrender and tragedy. In a concluding chapter, I discuss Nietzsche's relevance for more recent work in feminism and postmodernism, devoting particular attention to the question of evil and the character of theology and philosophy as ascetic, spiritual, and affirmative practices. g Kenneffi Thomas Rose [Ph.D.] Knowing ffie Real: John Hick on ie Cognihvity of Religions and Religious Pluralism. In this thesis, I critically explicate two themes central to John Hick's thought: the cognitivity of religions and religious pluralism The first theme runs through all of his writings, while the second is a newer interest. Hick challenged the claim of logical positivism that religious language is mean- ingless by proposing that such utterances as '4God exists" are indeed mean- ingful, or factual, since they may be verified eschatologically. I argue that this proposal founders on the problem of adequately specifying the eschatological verificandum that which would count in the eschaton as a verification of the claim '4God exists." This outcome is inconsistent with Hick's belief that religious language is cognitive. The problem of adequately specifying the eschatological verificandum as well as encounters with people of faiths other than Christianity led Hick to</page><page sequence="15">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 491 take up the issue of religious pluralism. He called for a Copernican revo- lution in theology in which Jesus would be replaced by God at the center of the universe of faiths. In response to criticisms of the theocentricity of this proposal, Hick developed a philosophical approach to religious plural- ism, which he calls the pluralistic hypothesis. This hypothesis is grounded upon the quasi-Kantian distinction between the effable, unknowable Real an sich, or the noumenal Real, and its phenomenal manifestations as the various impersonal and personal conceptions of deity in the religions of the world. This hypothesis, however, lends support, contrary to Hick's inten- tions, to religious noncognitivism, since the noumenal Real, being beyond human experience, is otiose and expendable. To avoid this unwanted outcome, I propose the recasting of the plural- istic hypothesis along lines suggested by other concepts that have been central to Hick's thought from the beginning: the cognitive ambiguity of the universe, human cognitive freedom, faith as interpretation, and the rational- ity of trusting one's experience. I suggest that had Hick developed these ideas rather than inexplicably modeling the pluralistic hypothesis on Kant's First Critique, his recent views on religious pluralism would have been more persuasive than they have proven to be. g Joarlne M. Swenson rIE.D.] Living Wiiin ie Larlguage of Resurrection: A Theological Cnfique of Modern Resurrection Mealiings. This study is a semiotic analysis and theological evaluation of the use of resurrection symbols by twenty-eight United Church of Christ parishio- ners and their pastors, in the context of individual qualitative research in- terviews. Two-thirds of the research sample used resurrection literally, to denote an afterlife they take to be real. But overwhelmingly, those inter- viewed employed resurrection figuratively as an exemplar (especially as an exemplar of "new life"), and these exemplifying uses almost always did not presuppose an afterlife or the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Thus, I suggest that belief in a resurrection-afterlife functions as a "valo- rized fact" for these interviewees; that is, it is a "fact" little used beyond its ritual affirmation, but "mined" for its orienting images and language. Other aspects of traditional resurrection belief were rejected or ignored (for example, the Second Coming), used neither to denote literally nor to exem- plify figuratively, manifesting what I term, "symbol collapse." I also argue that effective religious symbols are '4bifocal": they denote "the way things really are" and exemplify how we are to act in this "reality." In this regard, resurrection has remained vital as an exemplar of action. I argue, however, that if resurrection continues to lose its denotive focus, its exemplifying focus will also decline. That is, the research interviews suggest that the</page><page sequence="16">492 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVIEW second focus of religious symbolism, its exemplification of how we are to act, is only as rich, illuminating, and orienting as the first focus-its denotive focus-is credible. g Yen-Zen Tsai [Th.D] Ching and Chuan: Towards Defining the Confilcian Scnptures in Han China (206 BCE-200 CE). The Wu ching (Five Scriptures) are the most sacred books believed to be composed by former sages and transmitted by Confucius. Ancient Chi- nese viewed them as embodying the tao, the ultimate truth. To obtain it, one had to grasp these texts as an inseparable whole. This classical ideal, however, encountered a great challenge when Confucian scriptural learning became a national enthusiasm in the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). Thanks to the promotion of Confucianism by Emperor Wu (ruled 141- 87 BCE), Han Confucians devoted themselves to the study of the Wu ching and thereby hoped to enter the desirable officialdom. This "way of emolu- ment and gain" was further encouraged by the Confucian self-understand- ing that the ultimate goal of scriptural learning was to realize the tao in the sociopolitical arena. Since the Wu ching were too recondite to learn and acquaintance with only one of them was sufficient to be recognized by the government, the phenomena of scriptural departmentalization and elaborate commentaries on each of the ching texts occurred. The intellectual focus now shifted not only from the integrated five ching to only one of them, but also from the primary ching text to its commentaries, chuan. The pragmatic and reductionist orientation found another example in the Han treatment of the Lun-yu and Hsiao ching. People of Han China be- lieved that Confucius, "the later sage," authored these two chuan texts. What he says and demonstrates in them, sacred and authoritative, were commentaries on the Wu ching. Because of the textual simplicity, it be- came fashionable for one simply to study them in their own right. Further promulgated by Han rulers for practical purposes, the degree of their popu- larity eventually exceeded that of the profound Wu ching. Practicality and functionality are the keys that one has to take seriously in one's discussion of the Confucian scriptures. As "scripture" is an impor- tant expression of human religiosity, the scriptural developments in Han China thus exhibit significant implications for our understanding of Confu- cian religiosity. g Sze-Kar Warl [Th.D] A Synoptic Approach to ffie Qusestiones et Solutiones in Genesim et in Exodum of Philo Judaeus. A long-standing question in Philonic studies is: Why did Philo cast his Quaestiones et Solutiones in Genesim et in Exodum, a work that covers</page><page sequence="17">SUMMARIES OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS 493 essentially the same grounds as his Allegoriae, in a genre utterly dissimilar to that of the Allegoriae. The thesis proposed here is that the Questiones were composed as an independent commentary intended for an audience different from that of the Allegoriae, namely, the general reading public of the Alexandrian Jews. The first half of this study surveys the use of the literary genre CrlxtlRaxa Kal D£15 among Greek and Hellenistic Jewish authors. The genre was first developed as a technique for solving textual difficulties, but in the hands of Philo and his predecessors, the genre was transformed from des- ultory notes to systematic commentary. Each quaestio was turned into a lemma marker and each solutio, an exegetical comment. A commentary in the form of such a genre, because of its comprehensiveness and popular or educative appeal, was intended primarily for the general reading public. The second half consists of two synoptic studies, comparing the parallel treatments of the creation account (Genesis 2-3) and the giants (Genesis 6) in the Quaestiones and the Allegoriae. These synoptic studies reinforce the notion that the Quaestiones were intended not as preparatory notes for the Allegoriae, but, much like the latter, as a compendium on the Biblical text. The Quaestiones are characterized by a simpler style of exegesis and a relative lack of concern with resolving textual difficulties. Displaying greater tolerance towards myths, the Quaestiones were likely intended for readers less troubled by the mythic qualities of Genesis. The intended audience were probably first-century Alexandrian Jews who has been introduced to the rudiments of Biblical exegesis but whose progress not yet reached the sophistication of the Allegoriae. The latter were intended probably for read- ers familiar with Greek thoughts, for whom the biblical myths would be an enduring stumbling block.</page></plain_text>
