Faierstein Independent Scholar Melech Ravitch (1893-1976), 1 an important Yiddish poet and essayist, was the author of Meyn Leksikon2 a three-volume collection of brief essays or sketches of Yiddish authors, actors, and cultural activists. Abraham Joshua Heschel was the subject of a sketch in Vol. 2, pp. 21-23.3 The following is Ravitch's essay. I have tried to preserve his style and vocabulary. Two scenes: 1925 - Warsaw. I'm sitting at my desk with the big glass window, Tlomackie 13*4 Its been many hours that I've been calling on all my account- ing skills, acquired during more than ten years of work in a bank in Vienna, to tie up the loose ends of the miserly budget of the writers union.

It was the center of Yiddish literary activity in Poland during the interwar period. Ravitch served as secretary from 1925 to 1934.

Faierstein important - author of a classic essay in Yiddish/The East European Period in Jewish History," which he read at the 1945 YIVO conference in New York.6 If someone had asked us, the editors of the" Warshaver Shrifien," in the year 1925 for a horoscope for this youngest author of ours, A. Heschel, we would have predicted all kinds of configurations of constellations, except for this one, that he would be the author of an essay that is truly a poem in prose, a lament for Judaism in the East, in all of its spiritual lengths, breadths, depths and heights. I knew Abraham Joshua Heschel very little in Warsaw, seldom if ever corresponded with him, and read only a part of his work. I never understood his stubborn religiosity and never sympathized with it. However, precisely be- cause of this, that his whole life he straddled the two worlds of East European Jewry, his soul saw it, his whole soul defined it as Torah that is in the heart. Torah that is in the heart, in all the manifestations of Jewish life in Poland. When A. J. Heschel perused the first volume of this lexicon he wrote me with great dissatisfaction that I made a major error, in that in these intimate portraits I did not write about the writers work, whose lives I endeavored to describe, their person and personality, their day, their week. I see a contra- diction in this argument to Heschels own works in his classical essay, which sought "the refinement in the life of a people, spiritual substance in daily life." He discerned the pathos in general; however, he did not want to see the pathos in the particular and in the individual. Perhaps I am at fault, that I was not able to express the pathos of the daily life of individuals in the lexicon. From my youth I have battled triumphally within myself against religious forms and anthropomorphic concepts of God, which is the basis of the reli- gious path. Since he is religious, A. J. Heschel interested me as an antipode, since our first meeting. I once read his poetry and prose (in English) about prayer and faith. With deep anguish I considered, if faith in prayer was not so important among Polish Jewry (even among Polish-Jewish socialists . . .), the unexpected tragedy would not have thrown them so deeply and suddenly. It is enough for the religious when they convince themselves that God hears them. The unbelievers want that God should truly hear them. It is good to praise the Torah of the heart in a heartless world, from a distance, and not to closely experience it. True original Judaism means today and in this place. 1946 6This speech went through several versions and ultimately served as the basis for Heschels book, The Earth is the Lord's : U)e Inner Life of the Jew in East Europe (New York: Schuman, 1950).
