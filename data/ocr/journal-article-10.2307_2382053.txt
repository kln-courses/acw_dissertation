New York: Routledge, 1994. Pp. 193. $34.00 (cloth). The book aims to replace two false pictures of the relation between morality and nature, incompatiblist (Kantian) and reductionist (sociobiology and psy- chological egoism), with a naturalistic, yet, autonomous picture. Humans, like other animals, have natural (heritable) social-not merely individualistic dispositions, Midgley argues, but these, though necessary, are not sufficient Permission to reprint a book note printed in this section may be obtained only from the author. 886</page><page sequence="2">Book Notes 887 for morality. Morality involves more: (a) conflicting motives, (b) consciousness of the conflicts, and (c) the adoption of rules by which to resolve them. Auton- omy does not oppose predictability or a biological basis for (a) and (b) but is expressed in our species-specific ability to harmonize the conflicts and bring our different thoughts and feelings together. So conceived, morality is contin- gent (dependent on our actual motives) but not arbitrary. The book is especially good in criticizing egoistic explanations of morality; the egoist assumes that all animals, including humans, are by nature self-interested and explains mo- rality as a solution to the problem of social cooperation (each individual is better off if all act socially rather than egoistically). Midgley argues that animals are biologically social rather than solitary and morality is by nature rather than by agreement. The book blends philosophy and science in a conversa- tional, rather than technical or rigorous, style. M. R. Ross, Philip J. De-Privatizing Morality. Brookfield, Vt.: Avebury, 1994. Pp. 119. $59.95 (cloth). The central claim of this book is that a blend of Kant and Marx can provide the basis for an objectively valid morality. Quite a wide range of assaults on the idea of an objective ethics are discussed. Some telling points are made against MacIntyre's influential work. But many other philosophers are covered in a short space. Kant's formula of humanity serves as the fundamental princi- ple for the kind of objective ethics Ross wishes to defend. The main contribu- tion from Marxist thought lies in the idea that in order to really treat humanity as an end, all sorts of "privatizing" tendencies in moral theories should be resisted. For example, Gauthier's idea that the free market is, as it were, a moral-free zone is criticized. And even certain forms of Kantianism are too, inasmuch as there is an un-Kantian tradition within Kantian theories to ab- stract too much from historical and broadly social factors contributing to our ethical identity. In this way, Ross is in accord with more recent work by Kantians. D. G. Messerly, John G. An Introduction to Ethical Theories. Lanham, Md.: University of America Press, 1995. Pp. 151. $25.00 (paper). This is an easy-to-read textbook on ethical theory. Messerly starts out with a chapter on the beginnings of philosophy in ancient Greece and continues with a preparatory chapter entitled "Impediments to Ethical Theory," in which he briefly examines and rejects nihilism, determinism, skepticism, and relativism. He then presents several chapters on the standard topics-natural law, social contract theories, deontological ethics, and utilitarianism. These chapters have primarily, but not exclusively, a historical orientation. Contemporary theories are discussed in an extra chapter on natural rights, virtue ethics, and feminist ethics. The text also includes two interesting chapters on existentialism and</page><page sequence="3">888 Ethics July 1996 evolution. In the latter of these, Messerly discusses Darwin, T. H. Huxley, J. Huxley, P. De Chardin, J. Piaget, and E. 0. Wilson. Messerly concludes the book with a brief presentation of his own views. Presenting the material generally in a clear and understandable manner, he covers the main arguments and counter- arguments without dwelling at great length on any particular topic. The book's purpose, therefore, is strictly introductory. It is particularly suitable for students who don't intend to major in philosophy. M. P. S. Kultgen, John. Autonomy and Intervention: Parentalism in the Caring Lfre. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 262. $39.95 (cloth). In thinking about the values that are at stake in whether people are allowed to make decisions for themselves, a distinction is commonly made between promotion of individual good or welfare and respect for individual autonomy or self-determination. Kultgen, however, rejects this dichotomy, preferring instead to view autonomy as one, albeit extremely important, ingredient of individual well-being. A second popular position the author rejects is that competence or autonomy is a threshold concept whose function is to sort persons into those who possess and those who lack autonomy. In its place, Kultgen utilizes a relativistic concept according to which autonomy is a matter of degree. Both of these claims play a significant role in the author's defense of paternalism. Paternalistic encroachments on individual autonomy are some- times justified, he argues, because they may be necessary to "improve the net welfare of the recipient" (p. 201). The implications of this consequentialist position are not as revisionary as they might at first seem, however. In public and many professional contexts, Kultgen admits, this position will usually lead to the same judgments about the permissibility of paternalism that absolutist defenders of the right to autonomy make. The intuitive balancing of autonomy against other goods which he recommends is appropriate only for those who are close to and have intimate knowledge of another person. Hence Kultgen's fondness for the term 'paren- talism' to express his view. This book breaks little new ground in the philosophical literature on pater- nalism. More important, I am not convinced that thejustification for paternalistic interference rests entirely on consequentialist considerations of the individual's welfare, as Kultgen maintains. Nevertheless, this is a readable and well-researched book that should be of interest not only to moral philosophers, but to those in the caring professions who must wrestle with the complex ethical dilemmas that caring for presumptively competent yet needy individuals presents. J. M. B. Howie, John, and Schedler, George, eds. Ethical Issues in Contemporary Society. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1995. Pp. 213. $29.95 (cloth). This collection contains six recent Leys lectures given at Southern Illinois University; three are recycled from publication elsewhere; three are new.</page><page sequence="4">Book Notes 889 Although the title promises a collection in practical ethics, the essays for the most part are heavily theory laden. Thus, before we arrive at any practical payoff, Tom Regan subjects us to a familiar feminist critique of political philosophy (liberalism is "selfish" and of course atomistic); Louis Pojman takes us on a historical tour of seven theories of the moral status of animals; Carol Gould and James Sterba painstakingly reconstruct their entire theories of justice from the ground up. The two strongest essays are those by James Rachels and David Norton. Rachels's "Prejudice and Equal Treatment," though basically an introductory treatment of its subject, features a helpful discussion of "height discrimination" and a nice intuition-priming example of a widget selector who persists in selecting only widgets from Albany, even though widgets from Buffalo are of equal quality. The gem of the collection is David Norton's "Education for Self-Knowledge and Worthy Living." It is exhilarating reading for all teachers, at all levels, and a reminder of how philosophy might really matter to the living of a life. C. J. M. Smith, Tara. Moral Rights and Political Freedom. Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1995. Pp. 248. $54.50 (cloth); $21.95 (paper). This account of the nature, foundations, and value of rights is about equally divided between conceptual analysis and abstract normative political theoriz- ing. Smith's central contentions are these: (1) the unfortunate effect of inflat- ing rights claims has been to undermine legitimate rights; (2) the latter are grounded in the fact that humans are rational, goal-seeking creatures whose flourishing requires freedom from force and coercion; and (3) protecting such freedom is the only proper function of rights. Unfortunately, the enterprise as a whole suffers from three serious deficiencies. First, many of her more controversial claims depend for their plausibility on redefining key terms. For example, her insistence that rights are "egoistic" loses much of its punch, given that she appears to construe self-interest in terms of the achievement of one's rational objectives whatever they are. Second, most of the analysis is so formal that it is likely to be compatible with any plausible normative theory (even Marxists are unlikely to deny that property rights of some sort are implied by the rights to life and freedom). Finally, many of her more polemical claims (e.g., that welfare rights would "destroy the freedom necessary for individuals to advance their lives" [p. 201]) are highly dubious. M. J. G. Hobhouse, L. T. Liberalism and Other Writings. Edited by James Meadowcroft. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. Pp. 201. $59.95 (cloth); $18.95 (paper). Professors who wish that they could be "public intellectuals" will find this new edition of Hobhouse's Liberalism inspiring-or maybe quite the opposite. For</page><page sequence="5">890 Ethics July 1996 Hobhouse was a public intellectual par excellence. In a shortish career-he was born in 1864 and died in 1929-he was variously a philosophy tutor in Oxford, a leader writer on the Manchester Guardian, the first holder of a chair in sociology in a British university (elected to the Martin White professorship at the London School of Economics in 1909), and one of the members of that class of "the great and the good" that British governments employed to chair the Trades Councils that established wages and conditions of employment in major British industries. His journalistic output was vast, and his more nar- rowly academic output substantial. In a later age, we may well envy him his energy and his opportunities on a wider stage, or be moved to complain that his energies were spread too thin. Liberalism, first published in 191 1, has outlasted his more ambitious works, such as Mind in Evolution and Morals in Evolution; it makes the case, one still worth making, that there is no deep conflict between the ideals of communal harmony and a search for the common good on the one hand and the tradi- tional liberal quest for individual liberty on the other. Hobhouse thus squared T. H. Green with J. S. Mill and opened the door for creative and uncoercive government activity in the way that other Edwardian "New Liberals" did. Although it is a work that obviously puts a philosophical gloss on the practice of the Asquith government of the day, Liberalism has American resonances for those who listen for them. Admirers of Dewey, in particular, will find Hobhouse to their liking: they shared the desire to use the insights of Hegel and Darwin in good liberal causes, -and against the brutalities of the Social Darwinists subscribed to what we have come to call "naturalised neo-Hegelian- ism." James Meadowcroft provides a short, useful, and uncontentious intro- duction that largely sticks to biographical and narrative summary; the collec- tion includes some other short pieces, the best of them Hobhouse's essay on the right to property. American readers may find it all terribly English, but anyone who has suspected that in spite of appearances, the so-called liberal- communitarian debate was a sham battle will find their suspicions explained and confirmed. A. R. Esquith, Stephen L. Intimacy and Spectacle: Liberal Theory as Political Education. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1994. Pp. 285. $39.95 (cloth). Liberal political theories accord a central place to political education of citizens. But Esquith wants to move beyond this to offer a reading of liberal theory as political education, which he claims more clearly illuminates relations of power within liberal societies. In contemporary pluralist liberal societies, citizens have been reduced to occupying roles of clients and consumers, roles which encourage a constricted orientation toward power. This has resulted in an undermining of democracy and tensions between democracy and liberalism. Esquith's suggested antidote is a different sort of democratic political education which encourages citizens to attain a more democratic relation to power and thus counteract these trends. He makes use of the concepts of poise and sensitivity "where poise is the ability to keep your balance on a crowded, rolling political surface and sensitivity is the ability to hear what you sound</page><page sequence="6">Book Notes 891 like to others when you lose your footing or they lose theirs" (p. 22). Esquith examines the origins of liberal views of power through a thoughtful historical overview and critique of Hobbes, Kant, Mill, and Rawls. He turns to Emerson for an understanding of a more adequate democratic character. This perceptive book stimulates some fresh understanding of liberalism and power. W. A. D. Digeser, Peter. Our Politics, Our Selves? Liberalism, Identity, and Harm. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995. Pp. 271. $35.00 (cloth). Should we assess the quality of our political life by examining its effects on our selves? Digeser believes that we can (or, in Digeser's language, "soulcraft" is a permissible part of "statecraft") and that this is no less true within lib- eral democracies. Digeser takes on several critics, including those who think matters of soulcraft should be excluded from the political realm (for instance, "liberal neutralists") and those who think that their favored conception of the self constitutes the only relevant standard for evaluating political systems (such as communitarians, classical political rationalists, and genealogists). Most of the book concentrates on detailed analysis of critics' arguments and attempts to show how they fail. This detailed critical analysis is a key strength of the book. Digeser argues for a qualified permission for politics to be concerned with the self. The extent of the permission apparently amounts to allowing public policies to protect or provide the opportunities for cultivating diverse self-conceptions (p. 244). If this is indeed the extent of his view, there seems to be much common ground between plausible versions of liberal neutralism and Digeser's position (despite Digeser's protestations). G. G. B. Kingwell, Mark. A Civil Tongue: Justice, Dialogue, and the Politics of Pluralism. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995. Pp. 270. $37.50 (cloth); $16.95 (paper). Kingwell accepts the communitarian diagnosis of the failure of Kantian liberal- ism to articulate principles which provide the basis for a just social order in the face of significant moral pluralism. A credible form of liberalism must instead flow from a hermeneutical theory in which principles of justice are arrived at through a social dialogue amongst actual citizens. Kingwell explores and rejects the various existing models of "dialogic" justice-those associated with Ackerman, Habermas, MacIntyre, and Rorty. Kingwell's proposed alter- native-justice as civility-builds upon some of the insights of these theories, but it is distinct. Its central innovation is that productive and critical social dialogue aboutjustice can proceed from a pragmatic commitment to politeness which is embedded in our actual conversational practices. Indeed, considera- tions of etiquette are crucial to defining the legitimate contours of discourse</page><page sequence="7">892 Ethics July 1996 about justice among citizens. Kingwell contributes to our understanding of civility as a political virtue, and his criticisms of other dialogic models ofjustice are insightful. However, justice as civility, as a response to the problem of moral pluralism, does not seem to overcome some of the very difficulties which Kingwell notes face other dialogic theories. C. M. M. Tully, James, ed. Philosophy in an Age of Pluralism: The Philosophy of Charles Taylor in Question. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. Pp. 273. $54.95 (cloth); $18.95 (paper). This collection of papers is a festschrift for Charles Taylor, assembled by his longtime colleague James Tully. In keeping with the genre, the papers and discussion are mostly informal and friendly. The selection of material gives some indication of the wide range of domains in which Taylor's work has had influence. Contributors range from the usual suspects (Richard Rorty, Clifford Geertz) to more exotic types, like a Quebec separatist and a professor of nursing. Because Taylor has traditionally been somewhat outside the mainstream Anglo-American philosophical tradition, his work has, until recently, not been adequately discussed. As a result, Taylor himself has only infrequently re- sponded to critics. The most valuable element in this collection is therefore his forty-five-page reply at the end of the volume. However, it should be noted that much of the material he responds to is somewhat lightweight, and only two papers in the volume (by Quentin Skinner and Daniel M. Weinstock) raise any direct challenge to core components of Taylor's systematic views. The volume also contains a comprehensive bibliography of Taylor's pub- lished work. This is quite valuable, because many of his political writings are scattered about in unfortunately obscure Canadian sources. J. M. H. Gamwell, Franklin I. The Meaning of Religious Freedom: Modern Politics and the Democratic Resolution. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. Pp. 251. $18.95 (cloth). This book addresses the question, What, if anything, is the proper relation between politics and religion, given that the political community includes an indeterminate plurality of legitimate religions? This is, the author insists, a philosophical question about the essential natures of religion and democratic politics. Interpretive questions about, for example, the American Constitution can be answered only if the philosophical question is first stated clearly and answered correctly. Gamwell argues against both the establishment of religion and its privatization. He defends a view he associates with Sidney Mead, ac- cording to which democratic societies must acknowledge the political relevance of citizens' religious convictions and must subject those convictions to unfet-</page><page sequence="8">Book Notes 893 tered public debate. Because Gamwell takes "the philosophical question" to be prior to political and constitutional questions, he eschews examples. This strategy undermines the book's persuasiveness. The meaning of "religion" and "establishment" cannot be settled without looking at what religions there are and what courts have taken establishment to be. Yet Gamwell's arguments against other thinkers and for his own view turn on his definitions of these crucial terms. The conclusion of this book is bold and original; readers will find the arguments for it suggestive, but not fully satisfying. P. J. W. Beiner, Ronald, ed. Theorizing Citizenship. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. Pp. 335. $19.95 (cloth). Beiner has collected some easily accessible essays on citizenship, along with some important essays that have been harder to obtain (in particular, MacIn- tyre's "Is Patriotism a Virtue?"). The collection begins with two good historical essays on citizenship by Ignatieff and Pocock; the last essay surveys the recent work done on citizenship. The seven other chapters suggest different ways to think about citizenship. Most of the essays aim to describe the problems facing citizenship today; few purport to have many answers. This has the useful function of putting the questions facing citizenship today, in both theory and practice, in rather sharp focus. This book shows that considerable thinking about the meaning of citizenship remains to be done. Though no collection of essays can be comprehensive, there are two areas in which this collection is weak. Only one essay, by Habermas, has a European focus. This is surprising since Beiner (following Habermas) contends the rea- sons why citizenship's meaning has become important are changes in Eastern and Central Europe, the rise of the European Community, and the influx of immigrants into Europe. There is also only one essay, an important one by Iris Young, that has been directly influenced by feminism. J. S.-H. Caudill, David S., and Gold, Steven Jay, eds. Radical Philosophy of Law: Contem- porary Challenges to Mainstream Legal Theory and Practice. Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1995. Pp. xi + 336. $49.95 (cloth); $18.50 (paper). This collection divides into two parts, not entirely congruent with its editors' division of the essays into "Theory" and "Applications." One group of essays examines Marxist theories of law; the other introduces readers to some aspects of critical legal studies. The essays laying out basic ideas (e.g., Belliotti on Marxism, Smith on feminism) are helpful though elementary. It is unclear how other essays (e.g., Churchill on Native American land rights, Hunter on same-sex marriage) are connected to the "radical" themes sounded elsewhere in the collection. Other essays (Milovanovic on Lacan, Arrigo on postmodern</page><page sequence="9">894 Ethics July 1996 feminist jurisprudence) are too embedded in their subjects to be useful to novices, and not deep enough to provoke those already familiar with their topics. The collection, in short, is quite a mixed bag. The best essays (Belliotti, Reiman on the Marxian critique of criminal justice, Brion on tort law, and a few others) have appeared elsewhere, some in low-circulation journals. The collection's value lies in making them more readily available. M. T. LaRue, L. H. Constitutional Law as Fiction: Narrative in the Rhetoric of Authority. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995. Pp. 158. $12.50 (paper). This book is about the interplay of narrative and reason in the constitutional opinions of the United States Supreme Court. More specifically, it is about the "story that supports the logic, that makes the logic seem logical" (p. 36). LaRue practices what he preaches -he proceeds by telling stories about great justices (John Marshall) and great issues (the constitutional meaning of equal- ity in the Fourteenth Amendment) in landmark cases. LaRue's method is the source of both the strengths and weaknesses of the book. He has no theory of constitutional narrative; he concludes that there can be none. So, he provides no rhetorical rule of thumb for constitutional law. But if he is right that opinion writing is a craft and not a science, he has done the next best thing in providing several basic case studies replete with subtle and novel narrative insights. J. T. V. Rosenfeld, Michel, ed. Constitutionalism, Identity, Difference, and Legitimacy: Theo- retical Perspectives. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1994. Pp. 434. $49.95 (cloth); $19.95 (paper). This anthology is as formless as its title. One problem is that "constitution- alism," whatever its value as an ideology, is never shown to be a useful tool for analysis. Standard problems in political and legal theory are merely regrouped without significant contributions to discussion. These are an interesting group of problems, however. Essays deal with questions of constitutional interpretation, nation building in Europe, and challenges to liberalism from multiculturalism in the United States and nation- alism in Europe. The most interesting piece on these issues is Arthur Jacob- son's essay on transitional constitutions for Eastern Europe. Jacobson argues against Cass Sunstein that economic development is less a function of property rights and market exchange than a matter of organizational capability. Jacob- son also provocatively asserts that constitutions embrace political paradoxes, an idea which implicitly challenges many of the other papers which accept the idea of "constitutionalism" as an intrinsic norm which resolves constitutional</page><page sequence="10">Book Notes 895 shortcomings. A major weakness of the papers on these issues is that, other than Jacobson's, none of them deal with social institutions or media. Even legal institutions are treated as mere conduits for beliefs. The essays which truly shine are those which forgo "constitutionalism" and focus on constitutions as attempts to build political institutions anew in the face of specific constraints. Jon Elster discusses how the American and French constitutional conventions overcame the attempted influences of those who authorized them in order to establish their independence. Within the frame- work of an analysis of the ethical issues involved by the binding of future generations by constitutions, Andras Sajo provides a rich analysis of the added complexities involved in Eastern Europe, where nation builders are reacting against a revolutionary system and have restoration as an ideal. R. E. S. Baird, Robert M., and Rosenbaum, Stuart E., eds. Punishment and the Death Penalty: The Current Debate. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1995. Pp. 258. $16.95 (paper). This revised version of the editors' 1988 anthology The Philosophy of Punishment comprises, like its predecessor, two parts. The six selections in part 1 address the moral justification for the punishment of criminals in general, while the fourteen items in part 2 deal specifically with the propriety of capital punish- ment. Part 1 is unchanged save for the replacement of Hart's "Prolegomenon" with Richard Dagger's recent defense of a Hart-like approach. Part 2, by contrast, has been significantly beefed up with the addition of historical back- ground information, religious perspectives, an analysis of contemporary American public opinion, and the recent sharp clash of Supreme Court Jus- tices Blackmun and Scalia. One wishes, though, that a brief overview of the current American death-penalty system had been included. Like its predecessor, this is a bare-bones anthology with a rather brief introduction and no further editorial commentary, though a selected bibliog- raphy has been added. The readings are accessible, engaging, and provocative, and the balance fair. Part one exhibits the rival utilitarian and retributive perspectives on punishment as well as Rawls's efforts to accommodate both views and Menninger's plea for replacing punishment with therapy. Part two includes defenses of the death penalty on both utilitarian (deterrence) and retributive grounds, as well as attacks focusing on discrimination, mistakes, and religious objections. D. H. D. Bondeson, Ulla V. Alternatives to Imprisonment: Intentions and Reality. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1994. Pp. 279. $49.96 (cloth). In 1970 Richard Sparks, in a survey conducted for the Council of Europe dealing with probation and parole, recommended research that would com- pare the effectiveness of probation and conditional sentences without supervi-</page><page sequence="11">896 Ethics July 1996 sion. A quarter of a century later, the author of this book, who has been professor of criminology at the University of Copenhagen since 1980, has done that and somewhat more. She reports the findings of a research project dealing with community corrections in Sweden. It deals with three specific alternatives to imprison- ment: conditional sentences (a penal warning without supervision); ordinary probation with regular supervision; and probation preceded by a month of institutional confinement before release to supervision. The choice of Sweden for evaluative research on alternative sanctions was determined by the fact that the use of alternatives there was more intensive than in the other Scandi- navian countries. In an appendix dealing with developments in Sweden since Bondeson's book was first published there in 1977, Norman Bishop refers to her findings, accurately, as "essentially negative" (p. 258). Indeed, the somewhat dispirited tone of her report is reminiscent of the late Robert Martinson's celebrated article of the same era, "What Works? Questions and Answers about Prison Reform" (Public Interest 35 [1974]: 22-54). G. H. Weinrib, Ernest. The Idea of Private Law. Cambridge, Mass.: Haryard University Press, 1995. Pp. 237. $35.00 (cloth). Weinrib argues that private law must be understood formalistically, in terms of an immanent, apolitical moral conceptualism, by which alone it can attain the stringent type of coherence necessary to its ambitions as a justificatory enterprise. Taking issue with those who diminish private law's autonomy by interpreting it functionally, he boldly advances the view that private law has no purpose other than "simply to be private law" (p. 2 1). The central argument is as follows: An adequate theory of private law must explain (perhaps need only explain) why the defendant pays what the successful plaintiff gets. No combination of instrumentalistic considerations, such as compensation for the plaintiff and deterrence for defendants, can explain this direct, bipolar relation between a wrong's doer and its sufferer. The form of Aristotelian corrective justice, elaborated in terms of Kantian right, uniquely explains the mystery of why the defendant pays the plaintiff's loss, and is, therefore, the only adequate theory of private law. Weinrib pursues the implications of his Aristo- Kantian formalism for various tort doctrines. Strict liability is disapproved, surprisingly, as "consistent neither with corrective justice's equality nor with its idea of agency nor with its correlativity of right and duty" (p. 172). W. A. E. Geiger, Brenda, and Fischer, Michael. Family, Justice, and Delinquency. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1995. Pp. 168. $49.95 (cloth). Geiger and Fischer apply Rawls's A Theory ofJustice to the results of their own survey of the attitudes and beliefs of forty-eight children raised in Israeli</page><page sequence="12">Book Notes 897 kibbutz and urban Israeli settings. The authors conclude that the kibbutz is a model of the Rawlsian well-ordered society and that the children of the kibbutz become its model citizens. The discussion of Rawls is generally clear and useful but would make it appear that he has solved all problems in the theory of primary goods and his derivation of the difference principle, which the authors then rely on heavily in drawing their conclusions. Kohlberg's theory of stages of moral development is applied to show the superior development of kibbutz children without mention of its own controversies. The authors' positive agenda for American children consists of the sugges- tions that more day care and special schools for delinquent youth are needed, both on the model of the kibbutz system. H. M. K. Wicclair, Mark R. Ethics and the Elderly. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. Pp. 245. $35.00 (cloth). Ethics and the Elderly explores ethical aspects of clinical decision making involv- ing elderly patients. In addition, the book discusses research with elderly subjects, which has less direct relevance to medical decision making. Among the book's central topics are the futility of medical interventions, decisional capacity, age-based rationing, physician paternalism, and the role of family caregivers in medical decision making. The chapter on age-based rationing provides a comprehensive review of justifications for rationing based on age, but the author's critique of these arguments is incomplete. Thus, he neglects to mention that a policy of age- based rationing would affect many more women than men because in old age women outnumber men. Among the strongest chapters of the book are those dealing with medical futility. Wicclair is at his best when he explains that "medical futility" refers to what is "futile in relation to goals and means compatible with standards of professional integrity" (p. 23). So understood, futility is not an age-based concept. The author argues that providers are justified in foregoing interven- tions expected to provide no benefit to patients. Case-based reasoning is used throughout the book, making it accessible not only to scholars in philosophy and ethics but also to health professionals. N. S.J. Zaner, Richard M. Troubled Voices: Stories of Ethics and Illness. Cleveland: Pilgrim Press, 1993. Pp. 161. $19.95 (cloth). Those interested in the role of philosophers in hospital settings will appreciate these tales from a pioneer clinical ethicist at Vanderbilt Medical Center. The book is unique because of Zaner's use of phenomenology in the clinical setting. Zaner, unlike most clinical ethicists, is a phenomenologist and rejects standard</page><page sequence="13">898 Ethics July 1996 methods that analyze ethical dilemmas by privileging certain moral principles (e.g., autonomy, beneficence, justice, etc.) over others. He offers instead an open-ended approach that engages patients in philosophical dialogue in order to identify and prioritize their own values. Quite insightful is his understanding of the ethicist-patient relationship and its value and dangers. He also takes a phenomenological attitude toward his role as an ethicist, suspending many of his own assumptions in order to observe how the role is constructed out of the expectations of patients and physicians. Unfortunately, he does not exam- ine cases that might be irresolvable by his approach, morally problematic for the clinician, or regrettable at a later time by the patient. Nor does he consider the political context that influences ethical dilemmas. Still, this highly readable book written for nonphilosophers contains many observations about the prac- tice of clinical ethics that philosophers will find quite useful. J. S. M. Gray, Joni N.; Lyons, Phillip M., Jr.; and Melton, Gary B. Ethical and Legal Issues in AIDS Research. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995. Pp. xiv + 199. $42.00 (cloth); $15.95 (paper). Associated with illegal activities and stigmatized groups, the HIV pandemic is compelling us to rethink many of our health care practices. In the mid-1980s, the American Psychological Association began investigating ethical and legal issues arising in AIDS-related research on human subjects. This book had its genesis in that effort. Although focused on nettlesome questions involving psychosocial research and HIV infection, the authors broadly illuminate the ethical dimension of all scientific work with human subjects. Most of the book concerns information management: informing research subjects, confidentiality, duties to warn, reporting laws, and so on. The balance treats problems involving conflict of interest, incompetent subjects, studies on Third World peoples, the effects of fear on research practices, and some other topics. Typically, helpful descriptions of the legal and regulatory environments are coupled with astute but brief accounts of the background debates on ethics and public policy. There is, in particular, a commendable thoroughness in the authors' discussion of Tarasoff and the duty to protect identified endangered third parties. A useful introduction to ethical and legal issues posed by research on human subjects, this book will also serve as a road map for AIDS researchers and members of institutional review boards. K. K. Howell, Joseph H., and Sale, William Frederick, eds. Life Choices: A Hastings Center Introduction to Bioethics. Hastings Center Studies in Ethics 1. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 1994. Pp. 560. $28.95 (paper). Life Choices is the first in an anticipated series of anthologies drawn from articles published in the Hastings Center Report, perhaps the premier journal</page><page sequence="14">Book Notes 899 of bioethics. The book provides a broad and balanced survey of many issues that are important in current health care practice and in the recent bioethical literature. Most of the articles are quite good; some are excellent; all are worth reading. Moderate positions are represented at least as well as the extremes, and helpful discussion questions follow each article. Three topics arguably receive too little coverage: the allocation of health care resources, the role of nurses and other nonphysicians within the health care system, and the (admittedly often sensationalized) problems arising from the AIDS crisis. This collection does not include important court rulings or "classic" arti- cles in bioethics that did not appear in the Hastings Center Report, and many of the articles assume a basic understanding of central concepts in medical ethics-like patient autonomy. Still, instructors who can provide their students with the appropriate contextual and conceptual background should find Life Choices to be an excellent introductory text, and specialists may simply enjoy having some of the best articles from the Hastings Center Report assembled under one cover. T. M. Smith, David H. Entrusted: The Moral Responsibilities of Trusteeship. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995. Pp. 124. $19.95 (cloth). Josiah Royce once said that the world is a progressively realized community of interpretation. Certainly that is true of the world of trustees in nonprofit organizations, according to David H. Smith. Trustees have a responsibility to interpret the mission of their institution in light of its history and changing circumstances. They must do so within the bounds imposed by two further responsibilities: fidelity to the purposes of donors and respect for the common good, or at least for common decency. Smith insightfully explores the difficulties in applying and in resolving conflicts among these responsibilities. Of special interest are his detailed accounts of case studies such as the controversial exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic art at the Corcoran Art Gallery, the Catholic Church's conflict with theologian Charles Curran, the football scandal at South- ern Methodist University, and an abortion controversy involving Planned Parent- hood and the United Way. The book examines, albeit briefly, issues concerning paternalism, representation, deception, and loyalty in an area of inquiry largely ignored by philosophers. It deserves attention from applied ethicists, in addition to being essential reading for trustees. M. W. M. Weston, Anthony. Back to Earth: Tomorrow's Environmentalism. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1994. Pp. ix + 200. $39.95 (cloth); $17.95 (paper). Rather than broadening a traditional conception of ethics, Weston tries to restore "some ... sense of . . . 'vibrancy' and . . . 'richness"' (p. 8) to the world in order to reawaken practices which integrate humans with the rest of the</page><page sequence="15">900 Ethics July 1996 world. Much of the book concerns relations between humans and other ani- mals (rather than "the environment"). Weston argues for a tertium quid be- tween anthropomorphism and (dismissive) mechanism, in order to "reopen a lost sense of possibility" of how we might live (p. 12). Drawing on diverse sources, he seeks to recover a sense of the world outside of modern science's point of view. Our ignorance of other animals' ways of life-and our conclu- sion from this "that there is nothing to know" about them (p. 50)-provides much grist for Weston's mill. In the end, Weston suggests more than he can provide arguments for; he is often left exhorting his readers to open them- selves to that which lies beyond the bounds of rational argumentation. But this (acknowledged) failing may lie more with the type of position expounded than with any authorial shortcomings. While he offers an important contribu- tion, it is not clear how much of it will be heard by those not already sympa- thetic to deep, and other posthumanist, ecologies. J. M. Elliot, Robert, ed. Environmental Ethics. Oxford Readings in Philosophy. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 255. $49.95 (cloth); $15.95 (paper). At its best, environmental ethics moves beyond a branch of applied philosophy and raises foundational questions in such diverse areas as metaphysics, philoso- phy of science, and moral and political philosophy. Also, while works in envi- ronmental ethics often effectively raise difficulties with the dominant theories of intrinsic value, right action, and the self, they tend to be less successful when providing new, supposedly improved, understandings of these issues. By bringing together some prominent recent articles in the field, this collection does a nice job of reflecting both the depth of the insights and some of the difficulties remaining in this area of study. Questions explored in this anthol- ogy include "What has intrinsic value?"; "Is deep ecology compatible with political liberalism's commitment to neutrality?"; "Is there a defensible notion of the self which is greater than the personal ego?"; and "Are the values of preservation supported or undermined by the lessons learned from the science of ecology?" Not surprisingly in a collection of this size, however, many im- portant issues in the field are not given adequate attention. For example, absent are direct defenses of animal rights welfare and discussions of the theoretical difficulties of appealing to future people's rights, and too little attention is given to the conflict between environmental concern and human welfare that would arise if we were to embrace a nonanthropocentric theory of intrinsic value. This limitation aside, Environmental Ethics contains some first-rate articles, and I recommend it. D. S. Robison, Wade L. Decisions in Doubt: The Environment and Public Policy. Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1994. Pp. 263. $39.95 (cloth). "This is a book on how we ought to reason about public policy matters," Wade Robison writes in the preface, "and I want it to affect how we make public decisions." The book is deeply informed on technical matters, persuasive in</page><page sequence="16">Book Notes 901 its account of how pollution problems arise, and sensible in the solutions it recommends. Emphasizing incremental improvements in waste management, Robison rejects idealized solutions, whether proposed by "environmental gu- rus" or by "rational" policy analysts. "Any decision we make must respond to all we already have: It is too late for Eden" (p. 1). Environmental problems, as Robison analyzes them, arise from inade- quate social institutions, practices, norms, and habits of mind. He calls these "natural social artifacts" because they represent predictable human responses to natural needs. He suggests ways of improving them, detailing examples ranging from the disposal of asbestos and PCBs to the use of recyclable plastic in squeezable ketchup bottles (no mean feat, as Robison explains). The book would have been stronger had it referred to a growing literature offering similar "thinking outside the box" approaches and had it dealt with more than waste disposal issues. Nevertheless, it makes a welcome contribution to philosophical work on environmental policy. M. S. Stevenson, Leslie, and Byerly, Henry. The Many Faces of Science: An Introduction to Scientists, Values, and Society. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1995. Pp. ix+ 257. $55.00 (cloth); $18.95 (paper). I strongly recommend this highly engaging introductory survey. The authors seem to have found all of the best anecdotes about historical and contemporary scientists, and they briskly introduce a well-organized set of issues including cultural images of science as good, bad, and/or value neutral; science as aiming at pure knowledge or involved in politics or the quest for money or fame; as well as the ethical issues surrounding fraud and the involvement of scientists in the production of weapons and in damaging the environment. These anec- dotes take off some of the shine from what Philip Kitcher has called "Leg- end"-science as wholly positive and as pure knowledge gathering, but the authors also criticize romantic science bashing and present many examples of undeniable scientific progress and of scientists as exceptionally kind and gener- ous human beings. Even though the authors ignore some recent results and controversies from the history of science, their accounts are accurate and balanced. With its excellent writing and clear explanations, the book can be read independently by undergraduates, making it an excellent choice as a supplementary text that will provide many concrete historical and contempo- rary examples from science for students to ponder and discuss. D. J. S. de Pizan, Christine. The Book of the Body Politic. Edited and translated by Kate Landon Forhan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. Pp. 113. $44.95 (cloth); $14.95 (paper). This is the third English translation of Le corps de policie, but the first since 1521. It makes de Pizan's political thought more available, though Le Livre</page><page sequence="17">902 Ethics July 1996 des faites et bonnes meurs du sage roy Charles V, Le Chemin de long estude, and Le livre de la paix remain untranslated. De Pizan compares society to a living body, attributing the metaphor to a letter from Plutarch to Trajan. The editor ofJohn of Salisbury's Policraticus says this letter is Salisbury's invention: "There is no independent evidence for the existence of a work by Plutarch ... when the 'Instruction of Trajan' is cited by authors subsequent to him, it is always on the basis of the report of the Policraticus" (John of Salisbury, Policraticus, edited and translated by CaryJ. Nederman [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990], p. xxi). Yet, de Pizan does not mention Salisbury and is usually careful to acknowledge sources when citing an authority with whom she is unacquainted (pp. 41, 46, and 96). Interesting lines of inquiry are opened up by the availability of this work, which, placed next to the similarly structured Treasure of the City of Ladies, indicates a political theorist who takes society to be composed of two interweaving hierarchies, one of men the other of women. K. A. G. Guicciardini, Francesco. Dialogue on the Government of Florence. Edited by Ali- son Brown. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. Pp. 218. $59.95 (cloth). This first translation into English of Guicciardini's Dialogue on the Government of Florence is a valuable contribution to our understanding of political develop- ments in late fifteenth-century Italy. A recent addition to the Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought, this volume will be invaluable for anyone studying the development of Western political theory. Written in the 1520s by the author of History of Italy and Maxims and Reflections, this work takes the form of a dialogue between Bernardo del Nero, a former Medici supporter, and three men who were involved in the downfall of the Medici regime-Piero Capponi, Pagolantonio Soderia, and Piero Guic- ciardini, the author's father. In book 1 Bernardo defends the Medici regime, while the other three describe the Medicis' abuses of power. In book 2, Ber- nardo accepts the political reality of the new republican regime and offers the three younger men advice on how best to order their new system of "government by the many." Although Guicciardini prefers government by an aristocratic elite, he concedes, like his contemporary Machiavelli, to the current political situation. The bibliography, autobiographical notes, and glossary of political and philosophical terms make this a most useful text for both under- graduates and graduates P. J. C. Stewart, M. A., and Wright, John P., eds. Hume and Hume's Connexions. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995. Pp. xvi + 266. $40.00 (cloth); $18.95 (paper). This is a fine, useful collection of papers exploring Hume's connections to his predecessors, contemporaries, and, in a few instances, successors. (Most</page><page sequence="18">Book Notes 903 prominent among this case of characters are the natural lawyers, Locke, But- ler, Hutcheson, Reid, Kant, and Bentham.) Of the dozen contributions, four discuss ethics, four discuss philosophy of religion, two discuss epistemology, and one works out the cultural and political background for Hume's failures to obtain academic chairs. The remaining contribution is a recently discovered fragment of Hume's writing, about the problem of evil; M. A. Stewart does some literary detective work in his introduction to the fragment, making a plausible case that it is among the "nobler parts" that Hume excised from the Treatise in order to court Bishop Butler's favor. All of the essays are informative about Hume's intellectual context. Many of the authors argue carefully and thoughtfully, on the basis of this informa- tion about intellectual context, for substantial reconceptualizations of Hume's views. This collection is indispensable for specialists in Hume, and at least parts of it will be rewarding for those interested in the history of modern philosophy more broadly, as well as for those interested in moral psychology, the foundations of morality, and the philosophy of religion. I. J. S. Wokler, Robert. Rousseau. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 132. $7.95 (paper). This book attempts to summarize Rousseau's life and thought for the intelli- gent lay reader. Organized chronologically, it begins with a brief outline of the important events in Rousseau's life. Professor Wokler then develops a sketch of Rousseau's first important work, The Discourse on the Arts and Sciences, which includes a discussion of the circumstances surrounding its conception, an account of its basic ideas, and a report on its critical reception and continu- ing influence. He then proceeds to develop a similar account of The Treatise on Inequality, and so on, book by book, through all of the major and a number of the minor of Rousseau's works. In the process, Wokler discusses a wide variety of topics, including Rousseau's views on human nature, society, liberty, music, virtue, religion, education, botany, and sexuality. Wokler's scholarship is impressive, and he is constantly offering up interesting tidbits of historic trivia, but, due to the book's emphasis on intellectual biography, his discussions of Rousseau's central ideas are often unfocused. Ideas that should have been developed in one place are often spread out over several chapters. Thus, the book is most suitable, not for the uninitiated, but for those who already know Rousseau's work well. R. K. P. Van Kley, Dale, ed. The French Idea of Freedom: The Old Regime and the Declara- tion of Rights of 1789. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1994. Pp. x + 436. $55.00 (cloth). This latest contribution to the series "The Making of Modern Freedom" (Lord Acton is alive and well in Palo Alto) contains eight chapters by reliable experts</page><page sequence="19">904 Ethics July 1996 which "treat mainly the origins of the Declaration of Right in the political thought and pratice of the preceding three centuries that Tocqueville desig- nated the 'Old Regime"'; English and American influences are not left out of account, but the French provenance of French thought is underscored. The two finest chapters are those of J. K. Wright ("National Sovereignty and the General Will") and of Keith Baker ("The Idea of a Declaration of Rights"): the first traces the notion of volont6 gernerale in its earliest theological incarna- tion-the notion of God's "general will" to save "all men" in Malebranche, Bossuet, and Fenelon-then shows how Rousseau's "secularized" or civic ver- sion of what had been divine was appropriated, used, and abused by Robes- pierre and Saint-Just; the second shows that while English and (especially) American experience and thought were not irrelevant in producing the Decla- ration of 1789, that celebrated text is an "immensely complex document" which was "drawn up with enormous difficulty and great urgency"-so that, not surprisingly, it bristles with "linguistic compromises" and "dramatic theo- retical tensions." (In any case, for Keith Baker, it is fortunate that recent Declaration scholarship has begun to "shift attention precisely from questions of origins and influences to questions of meaning and situation.") Also good in this helpful and learned volume are Van Kley's introduction and his chapter on "The Origins of an Anti-Historical Declaration," and Thomas E. Kaiser's "The Declaration and French Jurisprudence"-this last chapter throwing valuable light on the transformation of French notions of property between 1789 and 1794. P. R. Seung, T. K. Kant's Platonic Revolution in Moral and Political Philosophy. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994. Pp. xv + 268. $39.50 (cloth). Seung states that Kant had an "incurable penchant for cheating," but his "fraudulent claims ... are so ingeniously disguised that they have misled not only his unwary readers but Kant himself" (p. 182). Two of these fraudulent claims are that duties can be derived from the universal-law formula as a consistency test and that The Metaphysics of Morals results from applying the moral law of the Groundwork. What Kant and his readers were misled into believing is that he had developed a cogent formalist ethics. For Seung, the practical enterprise is really a Platonic constructivism: Kant accepted norma- tive Platonism in the Inaugural Dissertation, affirmed it in the first Critique by identifying Platonic Forms with practical Ideas, and, although he seemingly gave it up thereafter, his critical writings are best seen as attempts at its elaboration. The core of Kant's Platonism is the highest good as social ideal: It is "equivalent to the kingdom of ends," includes "social institutions of jus- tice," and is "the ultimate end for Kant's derivation of of the three formulas of the categorical imperative" (p. 129). Seung claims that "this is a remarkable outcome and a great surprise," ignoring much recent Kant scholarship on the highest good. Still, his book is worth reading, notwithstanding its many instances of intellectual arrogance. H. v. d. L.</page><page sequence="20">Book Notes 905 Gibbons, Sarah. Kant's Theory of Imagination: Bridging Gaps in Judgment and Experience. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. Pp. 205. $45.00 (cloth). Gibbons contributes to recent efforts to appreciate the global concerns of Kant's critical system by elaborating the central role of imagination in the theory of judgment spanning Kant's entire enterprise. Kant put imagination to many uses; it cooperates with understanding in bringing concepts to experi- ence, but it also gets credit for the nonconceptual features of aesthetic experi- ence. Imagination's aesthetic activity is not governed by moral concepts, but it still plays a role in sensibly articulating reason's idea of the highest good. Gibbons sizes up these many hats imagination wears for Kant, primarily by constructing a broad account of judgment that would show imagination's fundamental reflective capacities to ground both conceptually determinate experience and its aesthetic counterparts. But Gibbon's treatments of imagina- tion in the first Critique Deductions, in schematization, in aesthetic reflection, in the sublime, and elsewhere, remain episodic: we see diverse roles for imagi- nation, but no sustained account of it as a unified power. The question of whether Kant can have from imagination everything he needs is never raised. Rather than bridging the gaps in Kant's theory of imagination, Gibbons's work tends to highlight the gaps in Kant's system which imagination is so variously brought in to fill. K. E. P. Gillespie, Michael Allen. Nihilism before Nietzsche. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995. Pp. xxiv+ 311. $27.50 (cloth). In this ambitious book, Michael Gillespie seeks to challenge Nietzsche's famous thesis that nihilism rises in the West with the sunset of the Christian God, and the attendant exhaustion of the West's belief in its own destiny as a civilization that confers meaning. Gillespie's anti-Nietzschean geneal- ogy of nihilism tells a very different story: the problem of nihilism arises from a hypertrophy of the will, not its atrophy, and is connected to a conception of the Christian God as omnipotent, not as impotent. The key episodes in this account are (1) the displacement in the late Middle Ages of Scholastic rationalism by Occamist voluntarism; (2) Descartes's response to the voluntaristic God of nominalist theology; (3) Fichte's radicalization of Kant's idea of noumenal freedom; (4) the "demonic titanism" of early Romanticism, of various literary and political movements in nineteenth- century Germany and Russia, and of the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche-all decisively shaped, according to Gillespie, by the pan- subjectivism of Fichte. This is a striking intellectual narrative, explored with much energy and an impressive density of scholarship; many insights into the history of philosophy await the reader of Gillespie's forcefully executed study of the pathologies of European intellectual life. R. S. B.</page><page sequence="21">906 Ethics July 1996 Santoni, Ronald E. Bad Faith, Good Faith, and Authenticity in Sartre's Early Philosophy. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1995. Pp. 245. $49.95 (cloth); $22.95 (paper). Aside from his theory of freedom, perhaps no aspect of Sartre's philosophy has attracted more attention than his notion of bad faith. Despite this attention, however, Santoni convincingly argues that Sartre's account of bad faith still is not well understood. Confusion and controversy continue to reign, in partic- ular, with regard to the issue of whether Sartre's early philosophy can accom- modate the possibility of living authentically and of overcoming bad faith. In response to this situation, Santoni offers "a detailed analytic examination, reconstruction, and differentiation of Sartre's categories of bad faith, good faith, and authenticity as they develop in Sartre's early philosophy (1937- 1947)" (p. xix). Santoni's discussion is clear, closely reasoned, and by no means uncritical of Sartre. Indeed, Santoni repeatedly finds inconsistencies and ambiguities in Sartre, which he then attempts, with considerable success, to correct and clar- ify, so as to enable the overall cogency of Sartre's account to emerge more clearly. The narrowness of Santoni's focus allows him to explore his chosen issues in extraordinary depth and detail and to include ample consideration of the views of other Sartre scholars. Moreover, his final chapter is noteworthy for containing one of the most extensive discussions of Sartre's posthumously published Notebooks for an Ethics currently available. D. J. D. Disch, Lisa. Hannah Arendt and the Limits of Philosophy. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1995. Pp. 221. $29.95 (cloth). This is a closely argued and consistently insightful study. Disch locates Arendt's work within contemporary debates, arguing that her account of political judg- ment transcends both neohumanist and poststructural responses to the mod- ern condition. Rejecting enlightenment rationalism but equally opposed to relativism, Arendt advocated public debate informed by "situated impartial- ity," which demands that participants consult a plurality of perspectives before forming judgements. This process calls for the imaginative skills of the com- mitted artist rather than the disengaged philosopher; Arendt describes it as "visiting," which results in "storytelling." Like other recent works on Arendt, Disch's book is true to its subject in leaving the reader with more questions than answers. For example, is "situated impartiality" a realistic demand within a media-fed democracy? We now have several competing expositions of Arendt's work, all of which make plausible attempts to appropriate her legacy for use in contemporary philosophical debate. However, Arendt's most valuable bequest was her inquiring spirit, and the greatest prize can only be available to those who try to recapture that spirit in discussions of current (and pressing) political dilemmas. In her closing chapter, Disch offers brief suggestions on this</page><page sequence="22">Book Notes 907 theme; perhaps it is now time for her and others to sustain this fascinating debate in the wider public realm. M. G. Outhwaite, William. Habermas: A Critical Introduction. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1994. Pp. 194. $35.00 (cloth). William Outhwaite's book is titled Habermas: A Critical Introduction. Despite the fact that it is neither an introduction nor critical, Outhwaite's book does manage to tame the expanse of the Habermasian bibliography in service to a clear thesis: modernity is defined by a loss of both traditional social functions and a loss of confidence that the public sphere can generate alternative moral, social, and legal norms. Habermas attempts to renew confidence in modern moral, social, and political systems by showing how increasing fragmentation actually generates appeals to communicative action in all these spheres. With the necessary appeal to communicative action comes, of course, the return of practical reason, and in a form that modernity can actually digest. The book cannot fairly claim to be an introduction if only because the admirable clarity with which Outhwaite pursues this thesis is checked some- what by the author's emulation of Habermas's jargon and syntax. The result is summaries of arguments often denser than the notoriously dense original they are meant to explain. The book is not critical except insofar as it reviews the standard criticisms that have been leveled against Habermas's work and to which he has attempted to respond. This approach is most disappointing where Habermas himself disappoints the most, that is, in his inability to comprehend the postmodern discourses of Heidegger, Derrida, and Foucault. Yet, perhaps for the same reason, the chapters devoted to Habermas's master work, Theory of Communicative Action, and to his recent, Facticity and Validity, are brilliantly concise summaries, both of those books and the debates they have spawned. T. T. May, Todd. The Political Philosophy of Poststructuralist Anarchism. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994. Pp. 165. $28.50 (cloth); $13.95 (paper). May presents a sympathetic account of the "anarchist" aspect of the thought of Deleuze, Foucault, and Lyotard. In contrast with the "strategic" theory of the Marxist tradition, which pins its hopes on the defeat of a single, monolithic source of power-capitalism-the poststructuralists have developed a "tacti- cal" approach, the seeds of which can be found in the nineteenth-century anarchists, Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin. According to the tactical view, power does not emanate from a single top-down source, rather it takes many different forms, permeating a vast, decentralized network of social relations of different kinds. The appropriate response is not a concerted revolution aimed at toppling a hierarchy, but local resistance to particular forms of power wherever these are oppressive.</page><page sequence="23">908 Ethics July 1996 May's argument is careful, balanced, and generally as clear as his primary texts permit. The historical link with the classical anarchists turns out to be a little forced, however, since on May's own account (pp. 59-60) the tactical element of their thinking is more the exception than the rule. The poststruct- uralists also depart sharply from traditional anarchism in rejecting the notion of a benign human essence, and in holding that power is not necessarily oppressive. If that is so, we have to ask which are the exercises of power we should resist, and why. May's attempts to answer these questions are interest- ing, but not satisfying. Faced by the objection that the ideal of "difference" alone may justify oppression, he ends by appealing to "generally accepted ethical principles" (p. 136). But this only begs further questions: are these principles (e.g., anticapitalism) really so generally accepted, and to the extent that they are, how far are they compatible with the promotion of difference? G. E. C. Johnson, Pauline. Feminism as Radical Humanism. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1994. Pp. xv + 168. $49.50 (cloth); $17.95 (paper). Pauline Johnson argues not simply that feminism is a form of humanism, but that it must remain so in order for feminism to continue as a viable social movement. Not surprisingly, Johnson rejects the "metaphysical" humanist's universal and repressive concept of common humanity in favor of an antimeta- physical "radical" humanist attitude toward the tension between the "univer- salistic character of [humanist] ideals and the always particularistic viewpoint from which they are articulated" (p. 22). Johnson takes Seyla Benhabib, Eliza- beth Fox-Genovese, Michele Barrett, and Kate Soper to be examples of the kind of radical humanist feminism she advocates. Such a feminist theory offers a critique of humanism at the same time it interprets and embodies it in a way that recognizes people's differences. Although it is a short book, it sweeps widely: Johnson discusses feminism's relation to the Enlightenment, romanticism, liberalism, Marxism, contempo- rary European male thinkers, and antihumanist feminist theorists. The breadth did not alarm me, but some readers may find their favorite philoso- pher not treated with the subtlety they prefer. Readers with deep postmodern commitments may not be convinced by the book; however, those who find some merit in the postmodern critique of humanism but are unwilling to accept its whole package may find fair-minded support for their sympathies in Johnson's arguments. A. G. Masolo, D. A. African Philosophy in Search of Identity. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994. Pp. 301. $14.95 (paper). This is a densely compacted work. It carefully illuminates philosophical per- spectives that have shaped current positions on the significance of intellectual</page><page sequence="24">Book Notes 909 and philosophical discourse that has emerged from African cultures. The book is at heart a critique of Western perspectives that have marginalized the merit of ideas and beliefs that are associated with African cultures. Among the myriad perspectives critiqued are those of Hegel, Horton, Kant, Levy- Bruhl, and Tempels. Masolo's central thesis seems to be that peoples from all cultures engage in reflective efforts to understand their experiences of the world and that reflections that emerge from Western cultures provide no more privileged access to truth than reflections that emerge from any other culture. I find this to be telling in light of the strong association of Western philosophy with science-Nancy Cartwright has aptly pointed out that the laws of physics lie. The excellence of this book lies in the wealth of perspectives that it brings to the discussion on what constitutes philosophy, rationality, and meaningful reflection. It is both thought provoking and illuminating. Any shortcomings found in this work pale in light of the wealth and the significance of the information it contains. I highly recommend it. L. B. Rescher, Nicholas. American Philosophy Today and Other Philosophical Studies. Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1994. Pp. 188. $49.50 (cloth); $19.95 (paper). This book is a collection of ten essays, some previously published in profes- sional journals, others presented at conferences, prepared during 1991-93. They display the characteristic traits of Rescher's prolific writings: analytic clarity, systematic coherence, and historical groundings. The essays are divided into three parts: Issues in Philosophizing, Issues in Moral Philosophy, and Philosophical Critiques. Readers of different persuasions will find nuggets of value in each of the parts and in each of the essays. For the present reader the first part proved most informative and stimulating. It consists of three essays: "American Philosophy Today," the best portrait of the state of Ameri- can philosophy during the last decade of the twentieth century; "The Rise and Fall of Analytic Philosophy," an insightful,judicious, and concise historical sketch of the main movement of philosophy in Anglo-American circles during the mid-twentieth century; and "On Writing Philosophy," a penetrating albeit sometimes dismaying essay to guide the would-be philosophical author. As founder and longtime editor of three philosophical journals, as historian of philosophy, with influential works on Leibniz, Peirce, and Arabic Medieval logic to his credit, as master of the techniques of analytic methodology, and as author of a comprehensive system of pragmatic idealism, Rescher is a thinker whose writings deserve our most serious attention. A. J. R. Welch, D. Don. Conflicting Agendas: Personal Morality in Institutional Settings. Cleveland: The Pilgrim Press, 1994. Pp. 195. $19.95 (cloth). This book examines conflicts between an individual's values and the values of institutions to which the individual belongs. Part 1 introduces the explanatory</page><page sequence="25">910 Ethics July 1996 concepts and theoretical model to be used. The theoretical model derives from the moral philosophy of H. Richard Niebuhr. The principal explanatory concept of the book is that of an agenda. Starting from an analysis of the notion of a formal meeting agenda, the author develops a broader sense of 'agenda' from which it follows that all of us have personal agendas which we seek to advance in our actions. It is our personal agendas which often come into conflict with the agendas of the institutions to which we belong. In part 2 of the book the author describes different types of response available to the individual facing such a dilemma. Here we are presented with such types as The Hermit, The Institutionalized Person, and The Reformer. In the final part of the book suggestions are offered about how we ought to respond in cases of conflict between personal and institutional agendas. It is emphasized that our responses ought to be authentic, where this is defined as being faithful to oneself in the responses one makes to institutional demands. There is much sound advice in this book. However, the book will disap- point those seeking a rigorous and theoretically informed treatment of moral dilemmas. Niebuhr's theoretical model is not developed in sufficient detail to be helpful in illuminating the conflicts discussed. Nor, in my view, is the notion of an agenda useful for purposes of clarification and explanation. R. J. C.</page></plain_text>
