<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Attack on the Rcnaissance in Theology Today* EVER SINCE the Renaissance first invented itself some six hundred years ago, there has been no agreement as to what it is. Its definitions have been as many and varied as the legions of scholars who have dealt with it, and the more that is learned about the Renaissance, the less certainty there is as to its extent, nature, purposes, and results. I need not rehearse the labyrinthine story of the idea of the Renais- sance; the study of studies of the Renaissance has become a scholarly field in itself; and Professor Ferguson has written the history of the idea of the Renaissance with just the proper mixture of authority, wonderment, and exasperation which it deserves.1 I should like to call attention to a single recent episodle in the history of the idea of the Renaissance, first, because it is concerned with an area of discus- sion of the Renaissance problem a little off the beaten track of con- ventional Renaissance scholarship; second, because it illustrates a peculiar power of the Renaissance itself, that is, its inevitable and in- variable ability to provoke heat and passion; and third, because it opens a kind of Beaumont's window into the motivations of history writing which affords us that perspective in depth so essential to its understanding but so diScult to obtain. I refer to the attack on the Renaissance which is a strong and surprising feature of the theology being written today. What is unexpected about ie attack on the Renaissance from this quarter is the almost unanimous agreement on this point of the theologians of all the major western faiths, Catholic, Hebrew, Greek Orthodox, and Protestant, and, among the Protestants, virtually all the denominations. The sharply critical theological treatment of the Renaissance, which often takes on an asperity a little at odds with Christian charity, is in turn related to the contemporary crisis of faith with which the theologians are primarily and naturally concerned. It is their view that the crisis of faith today is directly attributable to the Renaissance, that those ideas which have brought about the con- temporary spiritual crisis originated in and were developed by the Renaissance, and that the crisis is in fact the infection of the Renais- sance come to a head today.

There appears to be common agreement among the theologians that despite ie wide variety of philosophies since the Renaissance, they are at bo-ttom essentially all alike in bearing the Renaissance taint. T. E. Hulme declared without qualification "all philosophy since the Renaissance is . . . the same philosophy. The family re- semblance is much greater than is generally supposed. The obvious diversity is only that of the various species of the same genus."3 And Maritain goes so far as to accuse all modern philosophy of exhibiting the same error "Whether they be neo-Kantians or neo-positivists, idealists, Bergsonians, logistics, pragmatists or neo-Spinozists, or neo- mysticists, one ancient sin works in the roots of all modern philosw phies the old error of nomina;lism."4 The fatal descent goes from seventeenth-century science to the age of Enlightenment, through romanticism, Hegelianism, Darwinism, Marxism, and on to existen- tialism; as Berdyaev writes: Renaissance humanism affirmed the autonomy of man, and his freedom in the spheres of cultural creation, science and art. Herein lay its truth, for it was essential that the creative force of humanity should surmount the obstacles and prohibitions that mediaeval Christianity had put in its way. Unfortunately, however, the Renaissance also began to affirm man's self-sufficiency, and to make a rift between him and the eternal truths of Christianity. In this lay its error. Here we have the fountain-head of the tragedy of modern history, the tragic dialectic of humanism in which man's self-sufficiency becomes a denial of man and thus leads to anti-humanism. A divorce is effected between reli- gious and anti-religious humanism. In opposition to the divine-humanity of Christ that is the simultaneous activity of the two natures--the divine princi- ple began to szork against the human, and the human against the divine. God became the enemy of man and man the enemy of Godvfi 2 There is no point in documenting this generalizahon; it is eidler explicit or taken for granted in the works of the theologians who will be treated below, and it extends even to the unorthodox but religious cults, for example, ie followers of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky (J.

As ie influential German Catholic theologian Karl Adam puts it: The individualism of the Renaissance, the dismemberment of man and his relations in the age of Enlightenment, and Enally the subjective idealism of Kant, whereby our minds were taught to relinquish the objeciive thing, the trans-subjective reality, and to indulge in boundless subjectivism; these in- fluences tore us from the moorings of our being, and especially from our true and essential basis, that humanity which produces, supports and enfolds us. We became imprisoned within the walls of our own selves, unable any more to attain to humanity, to the full, whole man. The category "humanity" became foreign to our thought, and we thought and lived only in the category of self.6 What were the steps by which the Renaissance has inexorably and treacherously lured us to our present spiritual and intellectual di- lemma ? First of all, it shifted the emphasis from a theocentric to an anthropomorphic view of the world. As Atienne Gilson has put it: "The difference between the Renaissance and the Middle Ages was not a diSerence by addition but by subtraction. The Renaissance, as it has been described to us, was not the Middle Ages plus man, but the Middle Ages minus God, and the tragedy is that in losing God the Renaissance was losing man himself."7 The same idea is repeated by Berdyaev, who is quoted with approval by John Baillie, the Scots theologian; Berdyaev writes: C4The Renaissance began with the affir- mation of man's creative individuality; it ended with its denial."8 Agreement on this point comes as well from the Protestant Hopper who sums up the argument of the theologians in this way: Enlightenment, Marxism, Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and existentialism are criti- cised by Berdyaev, ibid., pp. 20-22; Kant by Berdyaev, in Matthew Spinka, Nicolas Berdyaev: Capfive of Freedom (Philadelphia, 1950), p. 73; the Enlightenment by John Baillie, Invita- tion to Pilgrimage (New York, 1945), pp. 74-75- Marxism and what he terms liberalized Protestantism by Northrop Frye in an essay, "Trends iD Modern Culture," contributed to The Hentage of Festern Culoure, ed.

The succeeding centuries confused the essence of this new vitality, and so the period suSered by degrees that fatal amputation of the spirit which left the period doubly vitiated from within by (1) a rejection of the faith and (2) an appeal to self- sufficiency. The Renaissance-modern mind, therefore, proposed to itselE a two fold experiment an experiment in thought and an experiment in culture-the one an attempt to find meaning by way of reason alone, the other an attempt to ground the self creatively upon its own limitless powers. The failure of these experiments brings us to the true crux of all human choosing and instructs us in our fundamental poverty apart from God.9 The Renaissance raised this hybris of civilization, as both Dawson and Niebuhr call it, to a new and absurd height,10 and we are now suffering from the dizziness of our belated realization that we have been left dangling on an unsupported perch. The transfer from the medieval to the Renaissance point of view brought about far-reaching consequences of which the Renaissance in its naive enthusiasm for novelty was unaware but from which its descendants now suffer. Hopper lists the shifts as follows: the substi- tution of personality for the doctrine of original sin; the substitution of perfectibility and progress for hierarchy and order; the substitution of history, or a teleological, for an ontological world view; and the substit:ution of "a sceptical suspension of decision on ultimate ques- tions" for religious faith, all opening the way for rationalism, sceptic- ism, empiricism, the self-sufficiency of reason, the subjectivity of knowledge, and the deification of science.ll As Berdyaev dramatically declares: "In making himself God, man has unmanned himself.''l2 Niebuhr is more sober but no less uncompromising in his rejection of the Renaissance: "The Renaissance is the real cradle of that very unchristian concept and reality: the autonomous individual.''l3 An- swering his own question, what is the chief cause of this crisis, Berdyaev replies: Since he moved out of the Middle Ages, man has followed a path marked by the autonomy of diderent spheres of creative activity.

Hence some of the creative powers held captive in the Middle Ages, could develoPolitics, economics, science, technics, nationality, etc. none of these will recognize any moral law, any spiritual element higher than themselves. Machiavellism in politics, capitalism in economics, scientism in science, nationalism in the life of peoples, the in- tegral power of technics over man all of these are the results of those autono mies. The basic and fatal contradiction in the fate of European man was that the autonomy of various spheres of his activities was not the autonomy of man himself, as an integral being. Man became more and more the slave of these autonomous spheres of activity, which were not under subjection to ie human spirit.l4 It is worth noticing how, once the logic of this argument is accepted, even the staunchest Protestant is forced to elevate the Middle Ages at the expense of the Renaissance,15 and, worse yet, to suspect the Rcformation itself because of its inextricable connections wii Renais- sance humanism. "The Reformation, like the Renaissance", declares the professor of systematic theology of St. Andrew's College, Saska- toon, Canada, Dr. Randolph C. Chalmers, "must assume a certain amount of responsibility for the disunity of European life following the close of the Middle Ages."ls And it is the Protestant Reinhold Niebuhr who submits the Reformation to the most searching criti- cism, especially those aspects of it which he describes under the head- ing of sectarian Protestantism, that is, "the impulse towards the per- fection of individual life expressed in the pietistic sects and . . . the impulse towards the fulfillment of history expressed particularly in the Anabaptist and socially radical sects''.17 Similarly does he subject the Lutheran and Calvinistic Reformation to the most stringent scrutiny and he concludes that despite the Reformation "polemic against the pfremature transcendence over history in Catholicism, it is as frequently tempted to commit the same error as Catholicism (though with the use of different instruments of pretension) as it is to commit the opposite error''.18 The Protestant Hopper makes what seems to me a rather half-hearted defence of Luther against Maritain's scornful "Spoilt Saint"; "the truth is", says Hopper, "that Luther 14 The Rreatm of 5pgrit and the Rrealm of Caesar, tr.

A major aspect of the Renaissance with which the theologians today find fault is what they term its excessive rationalism. The Renaissance discovery of the autonomy of reason led to the "real tragedy of the Renaissance", as Hopper calls it, and he continues: For these two prineiples that of the primaey of faith and that of the free eritieism- were severed. The insights of Luther were aeeommodated to a dog- matie authoritarianism not less stringent than that against which Luther had protested; and the free criticism of experienee beeame the notion of free in- quiry operating in the interests of empirieal investigation. Thus the spirit of man, whieh had experieneed the momentary release into a life of faith and wisdom, was hurriedly closed off from both by the intercepiion of a new dogmatism on the one hand and an empirical reduction of the criticism of experience upon the other. This left the self both naked and exposed, des- perately introverted, and subjeet to a dialeetic of gradual disillusionment and frustration. Secularity displaced the faith; freedom was debased into "emanci- pation"; humanistic good sense shrivelled into "enlightenment"; the individual lost his newly found dignity in the humiliating "diseoveries" of a naturalistie seienee. Meanwhile faith, uneritieised by life and experienee, eongealed int a Protestant scholastieism, or eddied into pietism and the several sects or eults of religious experienee (feeling); and free inquiry followed the path of raiion- alism, empirieism, utilitarianism, evolutionism, experimentalism, down to this present hour.20 Hopper reaches the unhappy conclusion that "the man who diF covers himself in the beginning of the Renaissance loses himself at the end of the Renaissance". From the disparagement of the claims of Renaissance rationalism, the path of theological criticism leads through the condemnation of Montaigne's scepticism and on to the inevitable full-scale onslaught against science in general and Descartes in particular. Perhaps on no other point are the theologians of all faiths in such concerted agreement as on their attack on Renaissance science. The Protestants Alexander, Brunner, Hopper, Tillich, and Zehrer; the Greek Orthodox Berdyaev; the Hebrew Buber; and the Catholics Gilson, Maritain, and Sheen fire their heaviest salvos at Renaissance science and Descartes. As one Protestant theologian has stated the case for the prosecution: Beginning with the new dispensation (the new covenant) of the Copernican revolution, setting free the SSmoribund" intelligences of medieval minds (to p.c#., p. 86. 20 Xbid., pp. 66-67.</page><page sequence="7">182 THE ATTACK ON THE 1tENAISSANCE speak from within the revolution), and conferring on the "modern" man a sense of liberation and emaneipation from Chureh authorities and dogmas, it ushered in the "age of reason and of man." In the eighteenth century this science took on a role more hallowed still: it became Revealer, and the age was called the age of Enlightenment. Thence came the "century of hope," the century in which science as "the new Messiah" of3ered men a new salvation -the salvation of indefinite progress, the bliss of material achievement, with comfort, goods, and conveniences for all. The twentieth century acknowledged this new Kingdom, projected its utopias, complied with all pragmatics, and sought to usher in the Kingdom for the masses. Accepting Marx as its latter- day prophet, it sought the rationalization of all mankind (as Lenin said, the "electrification" of Europe).2l Probably the most sustained attack on Renaissance science and its subsequent pernicious effects on modern science, philosophy, and religion has been made by Msgr. Sheen. IHis book, Philosophy of Religion, written by the scholar and philosopher and not the TV entertainer, takes up in careful detail the impact of scientific con- cepts on physical theory, comparative religion, and historical meth- odology. The effect of this influence was to create two different metaphysics of man, one the Natural or Liberal Man, the other Frustrated Man, neither of which is capable of sustaining itself in the face of the spiritual crisis. In sum, science, "metaphysically pre- sumptuous and religiously naive", is accused of dehumanizing and depersonalizing man by cutting him loose from his spiritual connec- tions.22 "The defect of Descartes' Discourse on Method!," Unamuno has stated, lies not in the antecedent methodological doubt; not in his beginning by re- solving to doubt everything, a merely intellectual device; but in his resolution to begin by emptying himself of himself, of Descartes, of the real man, the man of flesh and bone, the man who does not want to die, in order that he might be a mere thinker that is, an abstraction.23 But it is Maritain who returns to the attack on his "dear enemy", Descartes, as he calls him, time and again.

Maritain amplified this criticism in his 1934 lectures at the University of Santander where, in the section titled "The Dialectic of Anthropocentric Humanism The Tragedy of Man", he declared: In the case of man it is observable that in the beginnings of the modern age, first with Descartes, then with Rousseau and Kant, rationalism had set up a proud and splendid image of the personality of man, inviolable, jealous of his ilnmanence and his autonomy, and finally, good in essence. It is in the name of the rights and autonomy of this personality that the polemic of rationalism had condemned any intervention from outside in this perfect and sacred uni- verse,- whether such intervention comes from revelation and grace or from the tradition of human wisdom, the authority of a law of which man is not the author, or of a soverign good which solicits his will, or finally, of an objective reality which would measure and regulate his intelligence. Yet in little more than a century, this proud anthropocentric personality has perished, and been involved in rapid ruin through the dispersion of its mate- rial elements.25 In the wake of Descartes came Darwinism, which struck a mortal blow at the rationalist conception of human personality, and Freud- ianism, which administered the coup de grSce by making man a "monster, dear to himself". The ultimate disintegration of the per- sonality thus leaves the way clear for the collective man of Com- munism. Maritain continued the attack on Descartes in his Philoso- phy of Nature where, under the similar heading, "A Tragic Mis- understanding", he wrote: You can see holw Descartes' rigorously mechanistic philosophy of nature was, and this indeed is what condemns it as a philosophy,-a marvellously servile adaptation of philosophy to the dynamic state of the sciences and of scientilSc research during his time. He transferred into the philosophic order the very outlook that science needed from its methodological point af view and in the physico-mathematical order.26 24Jacques Maritain, "Religion and Culture," tr.

In Three Reformers Maritain accuses Descartes of importing "into ie sphere of the human the prerogative of the angel: intuitive knowledge, innate in origin and independent of the world of things".27 And in The Dream of Descarees, Maritain charges Descartes with distorting the concept of science; of destroying "the foremost and most immaterial of human hierarchies, the order of itltellectual disciplines"; and, finally, of disjointing man into inde- pendent and opposite substances. Maritain sums up his indictment in one incisive sentence: "On the balance-sheet we should inscribe: rup- ture of the impulse which was directing all the labour of human science towards the eternal, toward conversation with the iree divine Persons-upsetting to the plan of knowledge."28 Once Renaissance science and Descartes are convicted of such widespread and thorough-going epistemological deception, which betrayed man into the false paths of pride, solipsism, individualism, and vanity, the attack on the character of the Renaissance spreads in all directions. Berdyaev accuses the Renaissance of putting up man without God and against God; Peter Wust condemns it for substi- tuting a secular culture for the life of faith; "From the Renaissance onwards", he states in his essay, "Crisis in the West", "the Christian concept of God recedes steadily into the background."29 And it is Niebuhr who writes the theological epitaph on the Renaissance: "The mistake of the Renaissance was to overestimate the freedom and power of man in history."30 I may also mention four important but less frequently expressed criticisms of the Renaissance made by the theologians today. The first is by Bishop Anders Nygren in his stimulating Agape and Eros where he sharply distinguishes the Renaissance from the Reforma- tiotl by declaring: "The Renaissance takes up the Eros motif, the Reformation the Agape motif.''31 And he goes on to say that in Ficino's thought, for example, "empirical man is made, in a way such as never before, the centre of the universe. In a word, it is a quest of the human god."32 A second theological criticism of the Renaissance is that it gave rise to the idea of nationalism, to the inde- 27 Three Reformas (New York, 1936), pp. 57 ff.; ie summgy is by Hopper. 28 Thc Dreem of Descartes, tr.

Baron von Hugel puts the case this way: Then there came the Renaissance and the birth of the strircly modern Nations, with their supposed utter mutual independence of each other, and their sup posed omnipotent Governments two wild and poisonous suppositions. Here the entire self-suicingness, pure selfishness, and boundless competitiveness o£ the several Nations and States becomes the fashionable doctrine. With Hobbes, we find a conception of the State in full parallel with that of the individual man, and of both as purely predatory. The single man is a wolf to his fellowJ individuals - a single wolf amongst and against the other single wolves, uxltil the omnipotent state undertakes to do, for these single wolves, the prowling and preying upon the other packs of wolves with a perfection of force and cunning utterly beyond all private competition.33 His remarks would find a particularly strong echo in Berdyaev, who goes so far as to say that concurrently with nationalism the Renais- sance produced as a new way of life the form of social organization known as capitalism, a way of life prodigiously destructive to the spirit of man. And Maritain is as critical of what he calls bourgeois humanism as he is of socialism; indeed, in many of the theologians who criticize the Renaissance, the idea of the rejection of the world as it is, including its dominant nationalistic and capitalistic institu- tions, is certainly implicit, if not often explicit. However, Niebuhr at least grants to the Renaissance a greater liberalism with regard to toleration and the state than either ie Catholics or Protestants showed in practice. "The chief source of toleration in modern his- tory", he writes, "has been in the various forces of the Renaissance movement, both sectarian and secular." And he concedes that ie Renaissance "recognized the perils of conflict in the dynamic elements of social existence".34 Another argument against the Renaissance is iat it fell prey to historicism. According to Msgr. Sheen, both ie Reformation and the Renaissance opposed ie transcendent divine principle in history, for they "wiped out the past and gave us discontinuous history".35 33 Friedrich von Hugel, Essays and Xddresses onp the Phitosophy of Retigion, Second Series (London, 1951), pp. 262-63. This point of view has found expression in certain influ- ential intellectual Catholic lay circles, as, for example, in Barbara Ward's most recent book, Faith and Freedom. In his review of the book in rhe New York Times of November 8, 1954, Orville Prescott writes: "Miss Ward is a Roman Catholic who believes that the downward turn in the graph of Western civilizatiotl came . . . in the sixteenth century with the division of Christendom, the secularization of living, the rise of despotic governments and the exaltation of wealth so that avarice and cupidity ceased to be regarded as vices." 34 The Namre and Destiny of Man, IIx 221, 277. 35OPSC*JPS36OS</page><page sequence="11">186 THE ATTACK ON THE RENAISSANCE A most subtle and sustained attack on secular views of history is to be found in Niebuhr's Faith and History; he begins his critique by pointing out that the Renaissance returned to the classical cyclical interpretation of history but C&lt;historical cycles became spirals of ad- vance in Rcnaissance historiography. Its passion for a return to old disciplines was submerged by its enthusiasm for man's new and growing powers." The eGect of this transformation was to destroy the concept of endlessly returning cycles with their implied despair; time lost its mystery; and history was "no longer an enigma. It be- came the assurance of manXs redemption from his every ill."36 From this root, the concept that history is rationally intelligible, grew the subsequent modern views of history, views which NieSuhr con- demns as too simple morally, for he holds that C4manXs life and his- tory can bc made intelligible only within the framework of a larger realm of mystery and meaning discerned by faith".37 It is this view informing the second volume of Niebuhr's Gifford lectures which leads him to conclude that, from the standpoint of the Christian faith, "history is not meaningless because it cannot complete itself; though it cannot be denied that it is tragic because men always seek prematurely to complete itX'.38 The final criticism of the Renaissance made by the theologians today is directed against its art. I do not refer to adverse judgments of the art of the Renaissance on technical or aesthetic grounds but criticism which stems directly from theologtcal presuppositions. In his Mellon lectures, Maritain summarizes the course of western art since the birth of (Christ as passing "from a sense of the human Self first grasped as object, and in the sacred exemplar of Christ's divine Self, to a sense of the human Self finally grasped as subject, or in the creative subjectivity of man himself, man the artist or the poet".39 In Byzantine, early Christian, and Romanesque art, the mystery of the Person emerges as object; in Gothic architecture, and in the work of Duccio, Giotto, Arlgelico, and Grunewald, this mystery discloses its more human depths; and n the art of the Renaissance "the sense of the human Self and of human subjectivity enters a process of spirit- ualization, and passes from the objec depicted to the mode with which the artist performs his work". The results of this shift were a prise de conscience of the intellectual energy of art, a prise de conscience of the working ego, and, above all, "the unconscious pres- 36 Fa;h and HistoryJ op.

This he names the "modern malady" and he warns that "the time will soon come when the artist will no longer find his way back to the foot of the Cross when he has laid down his brush''.41 But the most consistent and detailed application of the theological criticism of Renaissance art has been made by E I. Watkin, a Catholic writer much influenced by Christopher Dasvson whose historical studies are based on his Catholic point of view. Watkin's bookt Cvtholic =4rt and Culture, contains five sections whose headings tell in brief the history of Western art as he sees it: classical autumn; Christian spring; summer: medieval Christendom; late summer: the disintegration of the medieval order: the Renais sance; autumn: the age of Baroque; and winter: the modern world. Watkin derives his critique of Renaissance art from his idealization of the medieval synthesis in theory and realized in practice in the Summa, the Dlivxna Commedia, and in the cathedral where "medie- val religion-culture achieved a harmony of the vertical and the hori- zontal movements of the human spirit, reconciled detachment with appreciation, built and ordered the earthly city with a vision directed to the heavenly". But the tension between the religious and the verti- cal and the secular and horizontal movements was too delicately poised and Renaissance art is the record of the disturbance of that tension.42 Watkin likens the Renaissance to an adolescent too eager and undisciplined in his enthusiasms: "Scholarship had opened to him the world of the past, exploration was opening up the entire world of the present, science offered the alluring prospect of a brave new world in the future." The result was that the "Renaissance ten- sions were thus largely due to the imperfect assimilation of the new matter, not yet digested". The logic of Watkin's position thus forces him to praise baroque art, the art of the counter-Reformation which he defines as "an effort to re-establish in every sphere the Catholic culture of the Middle Ages in forms and by methods suited to the novel conditions", so that baroque art may in turn be defined as "the 40 Ibid., p. 23. 41 "Crisis in the West," in Essays in Order, p. 112. 42 Cacholie Ar and Culture (London, 1947), p. 75.</page><page sequence="13">188 THE ATTACK ON THE RENAISSANCE employment of classical forms by Gothic feeling". He says of baroque art: "I love it . . . it was the ripe fruit of the Catholic religion-culture . . . It will teach us how to be free witout being lawless, to be humanist without being secular, to rise high yet range far, to live a life hid with Christ in God yet regard no human interest as alien."43 In essence, then, these are the criticisms which constitute the theological attack on the Renaissance today. For the most part, they are none of them unfamiliar to any one who has studied the history of the idea of the Renaissance. They have appeared singly or in combination in the work of critics of the Renaissance whose meth- odological presuppositiorls have been quitc free of theological con- ditioning and they will be found in their appropriate places in Fergu- son. I do not want to get involved in ie reasons for ie extent and virulence of this attack except to say iat, once you commit yourself to a denunciation of the salient features of the world as it is, you are inevitably led to the condemnation of the Renaissance, and the proc- ess works both ways. Many of the most persistent critics of the Renaissance have insisted that not only did it never exist but it was also a very bad thing, but here you cannot have it both ways: for if it was a bad thing, it must have existed, and if it didn't exist, it cer- tainly cannot be blamed for what then could only have happened in the Middle Ages, obviously from the theological point of view, the wrong time for bad things to have happened. What attitude ought one to take toward this theological attack on the Renaissance? Religious considerations apart, there seem to me three possible approaches. The first impulse of the defender of the Renaissance is naturally to expose the errors in fact, and there are not a few, in the attack, and it is to this task that Coulton has exuber- antly devoted himself.44 But it is not so much the facts which are at stake as the interpretation of the facts, nor can one question the ac- curacy of facts when it is the impetus behind a point of view which forces the accumulation of new information. Much more sophisti- cated is the approach which turns the tables by arFing that at its best the Renaissance exhibits those Christian virtues which it is ac- cused of denying. "The classical humanism of the Renaissance was fundamentally medieval and fundamentally Christian", Professor Bush has said, arld he has back of him a reputable body of scholar- 43 Ibi@, pp 139-40 44 See, for example, Coulton's criticism of Maritajn's scholarship, "The Historical Back- ground of Maritain's Humanism", 7HI, v (1944), pp. 415-33.</page><page sequence="14">189 HERBERT WEISINGER ship to sustain his point of view.45 But while this approach does in part redress the balance, it cannot nor does it intend to oncompass the variety and complexity of the Renaissance as a whole. Finally, I would suggest that one can approach the Renaissance without bias or ranccyr, to accept it as an historical phenomenon which, whether we like it or not, did take place as it did. Perhaps if we had been given the opportunity and the power to rearrange the history of man, we would have seen to it that it would not be as messy as it has turned out to be. But iere it is, not as we would like it to be, but as it is, for good or for ill, and I cannot see that anything is to be gained by taking issue today with events which occurred six hundred years ago, especially since we have other, and I think, more significant and more immediate problems to solve if we expect to have a future in which to continue to debate the Renaissance problem. If the world is as bad today as the theologians tell us it is, the blame rests not with Michelangelo or Shakespeare or Bacon but with us, and the reme- dies lie not in their hands but ours. But do not think that I am going to plead for the exclusion of bias and passion from scholarship. On the contrary, only conviction and zeal create the drive which un- covers new materials and yields fresh points of view. When the idea of the Renaissance was tied to the ideas of science and progress in the seventeenth century, it was alive and meaningful; when it be- came the exclusive property of the antiquarians, it languished and lost contact with living issues. History is a mirror in which we look into ie past to see how we ought to appear in the future and I would keep no cyne from pursuing this oblique utopianism. But since we know that it is not the mirror which lies but the beholder, we need constantly around us scholars who can tell the emperor whether his suit fits or not, or indeed if it is on at all.
