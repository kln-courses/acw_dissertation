<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Partly the Voice of the Wood": Acoustic Ecology and the Soundscape of Waiden Ian Marshall Many an irksome noise, go a long way off, is heard as music. - Thoreau, "Higher Laws" Initiated by R. Murray Schafer's The Soundscape: The Tuning of the World in 1973, the field of acoustic ecology has seen rapid development in the last decade or so. There are now several scholarly journals dedicated to the field, including Soundscape : The Journal of Acoustic Teology , SoundEffects: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Sound and Sound Experiences, The Journal of Sonic Studies , and Sound Studies : An Interdisciplinary Journal. The new attention to sound has spurred the development of several related fields. Bioacoustics, for instance, investigates how animals use sound for a variety of purposes (not just to defend territory or attract mates), and biomusicology explores the biological origins of human music. Several excellent books have furthered Schafer's work, most notably Bernie Krause's The Great Animal Orchestra and Jonathan Sterne's The Audible Past and The Sound Studies Reader. Surprisingly, though, literary scholars have not made much use of Schafer's concepts; I have found fewer than a dozen articles on literature and soundscapes. And yet Schafer himself frequendy referenced literary works and suggested avenues for further research in the area, since a literary text can be both a virtual soundscape on its own and a key source of information about the soundscape of a given time and place. I undertook this project as an experiment in reading: what happens to our understanding of a literary work when we focus on its sounds, using Schafer's (and Krause's) ideas about soundscapes as a set of tools to help us listen? Schafer suggests that other eras may have enjoyed not just different (and less deteriorated) soundscapes but may also have fostered greater "sonological competence." Henry Thoreau's Waiden , the classic work of nature writing, serves as a useful test case since Thoreau so clearly calls attention to sound by The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies , N.S. Vol. 24, 2016</page><page sequence="2">Ian Marshall 83 entitling a chapter "Sounds" and dedicating so much descriptive attention to sounds throughout the book. Would ideas from the field of sound studies reveal anything new about Thoreau's listening or the soundscape he lived in at Waiden Pond? Thoreau's fascination with sound has not escaped the notice of earlier critics who were not approaching the topic from the perspective of acoustic ecology. Alan Hodder, for example, speaks of Thoreau's "almost preternaturally acute sense of hearing" (75). According to Sherman Paul, for Thoreau sound was the "herald of correspondence" between the material and spiritual realms, as "[s]ound proclaimed the 'soundness,' the spiritual wholeness of the universe" (514, 513). Hodder too points out that the very word "sound" constituted Thoreau's "favorite auditory pun," so that "[f]or Thoreau... natural sounds were the harbingers of physical and psychic wholeness" (76). Hodder joins with Kenneth Rhoads and Jannika Bock in focusing on Thoreau's fascination with music, with Hodder finding music a "catalyst for ecstasy" for Thoreau (89), and all three pointing out that Thoreau's strong preference was for the music inherent in the natural world as opposed to that created by symphonies.1 There has been one initial critical venture applying Schafer's ideas to Waiden. Of the few articles dedicated to the topic of soundscapes in literature, Donna Mendelson's "'Transparent Overlay Maps'" is the most directly relevant to Waiden } Mendelson is making a larger argument about ways in which concepts from human geography can be incorporated into literary ecocriticism, and one of her examples applies Schafer's ideas to a reading of the "Sounds" chapter of Waiden . She sees (or hears) some ambivalence in Thoreau's treatment of sounds at Waiden, and she perceives Thoreau as expressing a sense of "territoriality" in his own contributions to the pond's soundscape (92). But as her analysis amounts to just a couple of pages of a larger argument, and she is not dealing with very much of Schafer's substantial thinking on the topic of soundscapes, there is a great deal more to say about how to read and hear the soundscapes of Waiden , especially in light of some new ideas, post-Schafer, about the role of soundscapes in the field of acoustic ecology. One way to read the soundscape of Waiden is as Thoreau's rejection of what Schafer calls a "lo-fi" soundscape (where there is so much auditory clutter that we cannot hear individual sounds clearly) and a search for a "hi-fi" soundscape (where we can hear sounds discretely and clearly). The opening two chapters of Waiden , "Economy" and "Where I Lived, And What I Lived For," where</page><page sequence="3">84 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies Thoreau lays out the philosophical groundwork for his experiment in living, are dominated by sounds of the anthrophony, Krause's term for human-generated sound, including the sounds of our technologies. These anthrophonic sounds are presented in a decidedly negative light, as a conglomeration of noise - or "unwanted sound," the acoustic ecologists would say. The source of much of the anthrophony in these chapters is the human voice - specifically the voices of those who would tell us how to live our lives. Says Thoreau, "I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors" (9). In "Where I Lived," Thoreau speaks of a preacher "vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest" (95). The voices of his contemporaries are scolding, annoying voices, often full of hypocrisy. Even when the voices of the anthrophony in the opening chapters are not hectoring, they are no more pleasant. Thinking of the "peculiar institution," Thoreau asks, "From what southern plains comes up the voice of wailing?" (77). So human voices all too often are cries of pain. Or anguish becomes anger: "Our hymn books resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring him forever" (78). These are social complaints (about slavery, religious hypocrisy) but Thoreau conveys them in metaphors of sound. It is not only the vocal part of the anthrophony that Thoreau finds objectionable in these opening chapters. Equally annoying are the sounds of our technology, as in this complaint: "if the engine whisdes, let it whisde till it is hoarse for its pains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they are like" (97). The engine, the factory bell - these are the sounds of the industrial revolution, calling for us to behave like machines, or like cogs in the one great machine. In these opening chapters the sounds of non-human living things (the biophony) and of non-living natural forces (like wind, streams, thunder: the geophony) are notable by their relative absence. In "Economy," and in very sharp contrast to what follows in the rest of the book, the lone clear reference to the biophony is far from celebratory: "I heard a stray goose groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog" (42). The goose seems lost - as lost as Thoreau himself seems to feel while he's dwelling on the subject of modern life (and while he is dwelling in town). In the lone reference to the geophony, too, he remarks upon its absence: right after the hound, bay horse, and turde dove passage (where nothing but their calls have left a trace), Thoreau speaks of "[s]o many autumns, ay, and winter days, spent outside the town trying to</page><page sequence="4">Ian Marshall 85 hear what was in the wind" (17). Here is his first attempt to hear what there is to listen to of the earth, and to do so he has to get out of town, beyond the anthrophony, since it is so clearly not worth listening to what people have to say in town. In his disparagement of the soundscape of the village, Thoreau anticipates the bulk of Schafer's argument. Schafer is a bit of a crank, irritated by the cacophony produced by our civilization and eager to call attention to the error of our ways. (This stance should sound familiar to any reader of Thoreau.) But Schafer's first chapter is about the natural soundscape, which he finds altogether pleasing. Thoreau reverses the order of the argument, showing us first the disagreeable sounds of civilization and then moving on to the natural soundscape. As nobody will be surprised to learn, he proves to be a keen listener who is incredibly attentive to the biophony and geophony. What might surprise us is that after the opening chapter Thoreau has nary a negative word to say about the soundscape through the body of the book (until the "Conclusion" chapter), and he includes in this very idealized soundscape many sounds of the anthrophony. When he goes to the pond, Thoreau does not escape the anthrophony, but he is living in such an attractive soundscape that even when anthrophonic sound is present, it is pleasurably blended into the soundscape. In fact, Thoreau makes a point, through fairly consistent stylistic choices, of using metaphors and analogies that make anthrophonic sounds seem akin to the biophony - and vice-versa. The first pleasurable sound that commands Thoreau's acoustic attention is silence. Perhaps that should not surprise us, as that is what might first strike most of us when we get away from the sounds of civilization. And after all, as Schafer says, "all sound aspires to the condition of silence" (262) - which sounds very much akin to Paul's observation that "sound was important to Thoreau for the intimation of silence that it brought him" (513). Even Thoreau's chapter on "Sounds" begins with an emphasis on silence. Thoreau says he sat in his "sunny doorway... rapt in a revery...in undisturbed solitude and stillness" but for a few birds that "sang around or flitted noiseless through the house" (111). No sounds of the anthrophony obtrude themselves to annoy him: he was not "fretted by the ticking of a clock." Even his own voice seemed part of a subdued biophony: "As the sparrow had its trill.. .so had I my chuckle or suppressed warble" (112). All in all, it's an unexpectedly quiet opening few pages for a chapter announcing its topic as "Sounds." "Brute Neighbors," too, puts a premium on silence. The chapter begins with the "hermit" listening intendy to the soundscape.</page><page sequence="5">86 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies What is particularly revealing is that when he is interrupted by the Poet (his friend William Ellery Channing), hermit Henry says he had been "as near being resolved into the essence of things as ever I was in my life" (224). So listening gets us as close to "the essence of things" as we can get. What did he hear? Mostly silence: he hears "not.. .so much as a locust." Then he thinks he hears something from afar: "Was that a farmer's noon horn which sounded from beyond the woods just now?" (223). The emphasis, then, is on the absence of sound, or only the faintest of sounds. He imagines himself living in a hollow tree and hearing "Only a woodpecker tapping" when the Poet arrives with "a rustling of the leaves" (223). The introductory passage is all about "clairaudience," which Schafer defines as "clear hearing" (11), with Thoreau intendy engaged in the soundscape. The power of silence is evident as well in "The Pond in Winter," a chapter that is mosdy about sounding the pond and not so much attending to its sounds. But the chapter's opening lines focus on the stillness of a winter night, with the auditory stillness allowing for a deeper "sounding" of Nature: After a still winter night I awoke with the impression that some question had been put to me, which I had been endeavoring in vain to answer in my sleep, as what - how - when - where? But there was dawning Nature, in whom all creatures live, looking in at my broad windows with serene and satisfied face, and no question on her lips. I awoke to an answered question, to Nature and daylight. (282) Here is another example of the power of silence to bring Thoreau to the essence of things, to bring us to the big questions. Kendall Wrightson, in "An Introduction to Acoustic Ecology," says we moderns fear silence, associating it with boredom. Conversely, we associate noise with the hustle and bustle of our technological civilization and equate it with the activity of life. But in fact, says Wrightson, the noise we crave masks a fear of confronting the self, since "being quiet tends to bring emotions to the surface" (12). Thoreau at Waiden shows what we might discover, or at least ponder, if we can find a spot to be left alone with our thoughts (and the natural world) for a little while. But even Thoreau felt lonely, on one occasion at least, and for him, as is true for most of us, sound helped fend off the loneliness. Thoreau says that the pangs of loneliness came a few</page><page sequence="6">Ian Marshall 87 weeks after his move to the pond, when he wondered "if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life" (131). But then he became "sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around my house," and he soon felt better (132). So Thoreau singles out sound as the force that alleviates his loneliness. But it isn't the sound of the anthrophony - he is listening to the soundscape to achieve the same effect that human companionship might bring. A few pages later he says, "I am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud" (137). Thoreau's potential loneliness is also assuaged when he spends time with an "old settler and original proprietor" with whom he enjoys some "social mirth" while the "wind howls" (137). It is the sounds, then, of both the geophony (sounds of the landscape itself: raindrops, wind) and the biophony (non-human living things: in this case, the loon) that keep Thoreau company. But we should note that the appreciative attentiveness to sound is only possible because of the relative silence he enjoys. Schafer claims that silence pretty much disappeared from our world with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, so we are not accustomed to it or appreciative of it. He notes that among modern writers silence is usually described negatively, as "solemn, oppressive, ...gloomy, brooding, eternal, painful, lonely, heavy, despairing, stark, suspenseful, aching, alarming" (146). Thoreau's celebration of what we can learn from a little peace and quiet is one more reason we continue to find much to gain from Waiden . Of course Thoreau celebrates silence not just for its meditative benefits, but also for what it allows him to hear that otherwise might be drowned out. The "Sounds" chapter closes with a review of the anthrophonic sounds that are noticeably absent from his woods and that he clearly does not miss: "I kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds; neither the churn, nor the spinning wheel, nor even the singing of the kettle, nor the hissing of the urn, nor children crying, to comfort one....Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out" (127). Those sounds that mark the soundscapes of his neighbors' lives Thoreau can do without. What he has in their stead are sounds of the biophony: "squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a whippoorwill on the ridge pole, a blue- jay screaming beneath the window, a hare or woodchuck under the house, a screech-owl or a cat-owl behind it, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox to bark in the night" (128). In</page><page sequence="7">88 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies other words, Thoreau delights that he is living in a different world than that of his neighbors, one filled with sounds of the biophony. There is an impressive variety to Thoreau's catalogue of the biophony in Waiden . At various times he describes hearing bullfrogs "trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake," taking over the soundscape with their " tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonM^ ("Sounds" 126); he hears raccoons "winnering at night" ("Brute Neighbors" 227); a dog "barking like a canine bull" at a squirrel and kittens "fiercely spitting" ("Brute Neighbors" 232); foxes "barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs" ("Winter Animals" 273); a squirrel that "waked me in the dawn, coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house" 273); hares that bound off "with a squeak and a bounce" (281) and rabbits and partridges that burst away with a sound "as much to be expected as rustling leaves" (281); "a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp" (276); "the striped squirrel's chirp" to announce the coming of spring (302); and red squirrels under his house that "kept up the queerest chuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and gurgling sounds that ever were heard" (310). By my count that is eight mammal species and one amphibian. But it is birds, "those wilder and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager," that most emphatically define and dominate the acoustic space of Waiden woods (85-6). And here the volume of references is overwhelming - I count thirty species identified by sound, too many to list in full, but here is a sampling: the "wood-thrush sang around and was heard from shore to shore" (86); "a tantivy of wild pigeons... gives a voice to the air" (114); "the note of the whippoorwill is borne on the rippling wind from over the water" (129); "a chickadee lisps amid the evergreens" (125); a night-hawk makes "a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent, torn at last to very rags and tatters" (159); peewees (he calls them "peetweets") "teter" along the Pond's shores; he hears a partridge "clucking and calling" to her brood and then he "heard the whir of the old bird as she flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing" (226); turde-doves "fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white pines" (228); jays offer "discordant screams" (275); geese come "lumbering in in the dark with a clangor and a whisde of wings" (248). In the "Spring" chapter Thoreau is positively exultant as the birds and their calls return. He rhapsodizes over "[t]he first sparrow of spring! ... The faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from the blue-bird, the song-sparrow, and the red- wing, as if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell!" (310). Schafer</page><page sequence="8">Ian Marshall 89 says that new sounds are heard as "figure" - that is, sounds that we attend to and notice - as opposed to "ground," or background sounds that are so commonly present that we cease to notice them. The freshness of Thoreau's renewed hearing seems to account for his enthusiasm in "Spring." When he hears the first robin of the year, he hyperbolically claims it as "the first I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note I shall not forget for many a thousand more, - the same sweet and powerful song of yore" (312). Thoreau in "Spring" also describes hearing "a bluebird, song- sparrow and red-wing" (302) and "martins twittering" (313); he is "starded by the honking of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers getting in late from southern lakes, and indulging at last in unrestrained complaint and mutual consolation," and he hears "the rush of their wings" until "with hushed clamor [they] wheeled and setded in the pond" (313); a merlin makes "a singular rattling sound, somewhat like that of the sticks which boys play with their fingers" (316); he hears a wood-thrush and the "humming wings" of a phoebe in early spring, and in early May hears the whippoorwill, brown-thrasher, veery, wood-pewee, and the "chewink" (a rufous- sided towhee) (319). All in all, it's quite an impressive catalogue. Tellingly, among the reasons we "need the tonic of wildness," Thoreau includes a bird call: we need to "hear the booming of the snipe" (317). One can imagine he would not want to do without any of the other calls as well. Thoreau does spend some time in "Sounds" bemoaning an avian sound that is not present: he says that he has not heard any cock-crowing, but if he could, "it would soon become the most famous sound in our woods, surpassing the clangor of the goose and the hooting of the owl" (127). And the book's only explicitly negative reference to silence, in "The Ponds," has to do with the silencing of bird calls. Since he left the woods, Thoreau says, woodcutters "have... laid them waste" and the result is uncomfortable silence: "My Muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth. How can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down?" (192). As Krause confirms in his studies of biodiversity loss after even a selective logging cut, the silence of the forest suggests a disrupted ecosystem. One of Thoreau's characteristic devices in rendering bird calls is to translate the calls into human language, often very effectively capturing the calls' rhythms and pitch changes. A brown- thrasher, for instance, says, "Drop it, drop it, - cover it up, cover it up, - pull it up, pull it up, pull it up" (158). In summing up, Thoreau refers to the calls as "amateur Paganini performances." While we</page><page sequence="9">90 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies could read this as a projection of the human onto the natural, we could also see it as an attempt to find the common ground between the biophony and the anthrophony to show how they can fit comfortably together. Thoreau also relies on sound devices like assonance, alliteration, and internal rhyme to suggest the sounds of birdcalls. A chickadee's "faint flitting lisping notes. ..like the tinkling of icicles in grass" hint at their tsi-ki-li-li call with the repeated / sounds, the short i sounds, the "ike" sounds, the /s and / s. When a partridge "bursts away on whirring wings," the "ur" rhyme and the alliterated w 's evoke the sound quite effectively. Thoreau also uses alliteration in a description of geese in "Spring": "For a week I heard the circling groping clangor of some solitary goose in the foggy mornings, seeking its companion, and still peopling the woods with the sound of a larger life than they could sustain" (313). The alliteration of c&gt; g, and ng echo the honking of a goose. At other times he relies on onomatopoeia to capture in human language the tonalities of birdsong - like the " olit , olit, olit , - chip, chip, chip, che char, - che wis s, wiss, wiss" with which he describes a song sparrow doing its part to crack the ice of Waiden pond (311). On the subject of owls, Thoreau stretches further the empathetic capacity of his language. In "Sounds" he says that screech owls with "their ancient u-lu-lu" unleash a "dismal scream.. .a most solemn graveyard ditty"; they sigh "with the resdessness of despair," wailing " Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n" (124-25). A hoot owl is Nature's attempt to "make permanent in her choir the dying moans of a human being... made more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousness, - I find myself beginning with the letters gl when I try to imitate it" (125). In the sheer volume of his attempts to capture the sounds of the owls linguistically, and to convey the moods evoked by their calls, Thoreau demonstrates that he is immersed in a new soundscape, haunting but busy. The detailed sound descriptions as Thoreau renders the bird calls in fresh language seem to overwhelm his senses at times. A hoot owl in "Winter Animals" sounds as if the stringed earth has been "struck with a plectrum"; the wings of the geese are like a "tempest in the woods"; a cat-owl shrieks "in the most harsh and tremendous voice I ever heard"; the geese call back with "a greater compass and volume of voice," chastening the owl for "alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me" (272). Is it the relative silence of a winter night that makes the biophony sound so voluminously in this passage? But here is the interesting thing: Thoreau still does not consider the "thrilling discord" to amount to a racket. "|T]f you had a discriminating ear," he says (and he obviously does), "there were in it</page><page sequence="10">Ian Marshall 91 the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard" (271-72). So it's loud - but clear. And harmonious. Perhaps no single creature absorbs as much of Thoreau's attention as the loon, and, again, much of his engagement is rendered in terms of sound. The famous encounter with the loon takes place in "Brute Neighbors," as Thoreau chases after the loon in his boat, trying to guess where the loon would come up next and feeling taunted by the loon's echoing laugh. That laugh Thoreau describes as "wild," "unearthly," "loud," and "demoniac" (235-36). Thoreau is even more impressed with, and starded by, the sound the loon makes "when he had balked me most successfully and came up a long way off." On those occasions, "he uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This was his looning, - perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide" (236). 2 Thoreau is clearly marking the loon's "looning" as a "soundmark" of Waiden Pond - that is, a distinctive feature that stands out in a place and provides its acoustic character. The attraction of Waiden Pond is not just that he is close enough to town to bring his laundry home on weekends - it is also that he is far enough away that he can make contact with the wild, as expressed by the looning. And this in fact is typical of pastoral, a middle distance partaking of both domestic and wild, with the looning and the anthrophony both part of pastoral's acoustic mix. After "one of those prolonged howls" of the loon, Thoreau notes that the wind picked up and it started to rain, "as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry with me" (236). 2 The wind and rain responding to the loon's call are examples of geophonic sound, and Thoreau is as attentive to, and appreciative of, the sounds of the geophony as he is of the biophony. The geophony is most prominent in "Spring," when Thoreau describes the "sullen rush and roar" caused by the ice breaking up, "its edge grating on the shore" (304). After the melt, Thoreau says that "[t]he brooks sing carols and glees to the spring" (310). The constant of streamsound is certainly the kind of thing that would typically be considered ground noise, but again the newness of spring allows Thoreau to hear it afresh. He even hears "the sinking sound of melting snow... in all the dells" (310). At the pond, then - and this should not be much of a surprise - Thoreau is extraordinarily attentive to and apreciative of both the biophony and the geophony. But the most interesting part of the soundscape of Waiden the book and Waiden the place is what happens to Thoreau's descriptions of the anthrophony as the book</page><page sequence="11">92 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies progresses. As negatively as anthrophonic sound is perceived in "Economy" (and as it will be again in "Conclusion"), in the body of Waiden Thoreau perceives the anthrophony in an overwhelmingly positive light. The favorable assessment of some sources of anthrophonic sound will not surprise us - for example Thoreau's flute in "The Bean-Field," which "has waked the echoes" over the pond (155-56). He is remembering visiting Waiden as a boy, and the lyrical image suggests a strong connection to the place, and the human artifact of the flute fits beautifully into the soundscape. In "Higher Laws," he suggests that his flute-playing was pleasant to others as well: for "John Farmer," he conjectures, the "sound harmonized with his mood.... [X] he notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain faculties which slumbered in him" (222). In "The Ponds" Thoreau is the grateful listener to someone else's music. An otherwise quiet fishing companion, he says, "hummed a psalm," and so "[o]ur intercourse was thus altogether one of unbroken harmony, far more pleasing to remember than if it had been carried on by speech" (174). On other occasions, even human conversation seems perfectly pleasant to Thoreau. In "Former Inhabitants," the most talk-heavy chapter of the book, the most joyous descriptions are reserved for the conversations with the visiting poet (William Ellery Channing): "We made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound with the murmur of much sober talk, making amends then to Waiden vale for the long silence. Broadway was still and deserted then by comparison. At suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter" (268). Note that his way of expressing his pleasure in the visits focuses on sound - the emphasis is on what is to be heard as a way of capturing the convivial scene. And note how different this is from the grating way human conversations are presented in "Economy." Of course, Thoreau still values a quiet conversation as well, which is clear in his description of a visit from the Connecticut philosopher (Bronson Alcott), where it's quiet enough "that the fishes of thought were not scared from the stream." For all the moderate temper of their words, their import "expanded and racked my little house" (270). It is not just conversation that Thoreau is willing to hear more positively once he is living by the Pond. Even the sounds of hunting, an activity which we might expect Thoreau to find disruptive, becomes acoustically interesting to him. In "Brute Neighbors" he describes hunters trying to bag a loon as "rustling through the woods like autumn leaves." Immediately afterwards,</page><page sequence="12">Ian Marshall 93 Thoreau turns to "the kind October wind... rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water" (233). Both the hunters and the wind, then, are described as "rustling" - and if the hunters are "like autumn leaves," the wind is rustling them. In other words, the sounds of the hunt are naturalized, so that the anthrophony blends into the soundscape as naturally as the sounds of the geophony. As the description of the loon hunt continues, the hunters "make the woods resound with their discharges." In response, "The waves generously rise and dash angrily, taking sides with all waterfowl" (234). The anthrophonic disruption of the soundscape engenders a geophonic response equal in vehemence to the sounds of the anthrophony, so that there is a kind of dialogue taking place, a heteroglossia (or heterophony?) in which human, animal, and natural forces all have their say. This tactic of blending anthropogenic sound with the biophony and geophony is characteristic of Thoreau's portrayals of the anthrophony through much of Waiden. And it helps clarify what might seem like Thoreau's contradictory responses to the railroad, which he is quite critical of in "Where I Lived, And What I Lived For": "We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us" (92). But once he settles into his cabin by the pond, in "Sounds," Thoreau seems to hear the sounds of the railroad as essentially another set of clearly heard, natural sounds distinctive to the place. The "rattle of railroad cars" are "now dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridge" (114); "The whisde of a locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter, sounding like the scream of a hawk" (115); and of course it is an "iron horse" that can "make the hills echo with his snort like thunder, shaking the earth with his feet, and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils" - loud to be sure, but still described as a living thing (116). Even when he compares the sounds of the train to human voices, the description seems to be far more positive than it was earlier; rather than sermons and scoldings, we hear an enthusiastic gift exchange: "Here come your groceries, country; your rations, countrymen!... And here's your pay for them! screams the countryman's whisde" (115). While the conversation is energetic and loud, it's at least civil and dialogic. While Thoreau is critical of the railroad in "Where I Lived," here he finds the railroad a welcome part of his soundscape - a signature soundmark of his particular place. Schafer contends that technological sounds are more likely to be disliked in technologically advanced societies than in those where technology is in the developing stage (147). Perhaps this accounts for Thoreau's famous ambivalence about the railroad,</page><page sequence="13">94 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies despising it as an intruder and a disturber of the peace at times, thrilling to its sounds at others. He's caught between a non- technological society that welcomes the sounds of machines and a technologically advanced society that tends to dislike sounds of machines as we become aware of the downside of technological progress - something Thoreau would be among the first of his contemporaries to be tuned in to, suspicious as he was of all so- called modern improvements. The tendency to hear the anthrophony blended with the biophony is evident throughout "Sounds," even in Thoreau's quieter moments: the "distant lowing of some cow" sounds to Thoreau like "the voices of certain minstrels," wandering youths who sometimes ventured into the woods. Thoreau clarifies that he is not being "satirical" in comparing the two; he appreciates that the singing was "akin to the music of the cow," all "one articulation of nature" (123). The bells from nearby towns produce "a faint, sweet, and, as it were, natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness." Sound heard at a distance, he says, produces "a vibration of the universal lyre," and the bells made "a melody which the air had strained, and which had conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood," so that what he could hear was "pardy the voice of the wood" (123). Schafer writes extensively of bells, listing them as a kind of "sacred noise" - a sound that may be loud but that enjoys the approval of the authorities, so we are not allowed to complain about them. At times sacred noise can become "sound imperialism," when sound is used to dominate a soundscape. One would expect Thoreau to complain about the bells, especially after his complaints about the sounds of the anthrophony that he objected to hearing in town. Why doesn't Thoreau seem offended? Because he hears those bells at a comfortable distance. Schafer says that bells can have either a centripetal function - to call people in for a meeting, as Thoreau would do when he rang the town's church bells to announce his lecture on John Brown - or a centrifugal function, moving outward, with its range essentially defining the borders of the acoustic community. It's a neat way of clarifying Thoreau's situation - still part of the community (and still close enough to town to visit regularly) but far enough away that its sounds are pleasandy distant and filtered through the forest. Essentially, a study of Thoreau's soundscape at Waiden, then, confirms the notion that he is positioned in a middle ground, where both biophony and anthrophony can be heard clearly without the latter overwhelming the rest of the soundscape.</page><page sequence="14">Ian Marshall 95 Even village sounds less appealing than bells become blended with the natural world from Thoreau's comfortable distance at the Pond. When "the town fires its great guns," says Thoreau, they "echo like popguns to these woods, and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate this far.... [T]he big guns sounded as if a puff ball had burst" (160). The firing of guns - which we might expect Thoreau to perceive as technology doing violence unto the biophony - is instead heard as a puffball bursting. The sound is not quite "domesticated," since it is described in terms of the wild, but it is toned down quite a bit in being rendered into something natural or pastoralized. As Thoreau works in his bean-field, the next anthrophonic sound penetrating the woods from town at first seems to resist being blended into the biophony. Thoreau hears music and says "it sounded as if all the village was a vast bellows, and all the buildings expanded and collapsed alternately with a din" (160). So far this is all anthrophony; even music is described as if it's a technological tool making "a din." And his reaction is not a peaceful one: "But sometimes it was a really noble and inspiring strain that reached these woods, and the trumpet that sings of fame, and I felt as if I could spit a Mexican with a good relish... and looked round for a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon" (160-61). Given what we know of Thoreau's disapproval of the Mexican War, this seems like Grinchy satire on the noise emanating from town - the society pawing at him with its dirty institutions even unto these woods a mile and a half away, inspiring him to violence in a bad cause. But at the end of the passage, he's looking around to exercise his energy against a woodchuck or skunk, suggesting that even these "martial strains," heard at a distance, can be absorbed into the life of the woods, inspiring no violence of armies but only the planter's vengeance on a too-hungry woodchuck. Even when Thoreau leaves the pond and wanders into town, he seems undisturbed by the anthrophonic sounds that once irritated him so much. In the village he hears gossip, "which, taken in homeopathic doses," he writes, "was really as refreshing in its way as the rusde of leaves and the peeping of frogs... instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts ratde" (167). Bock has argued that "[b]y themselves sounds of human activity and industry... are disturbing to Thoreau" (3). But from this evidence, it seems, once he's living at the pond the sounds of the anthrophony no longer overwhelm or disturb Thoreau; they simply take their place among other sounds of the world, no longer noise (unwanted sound) or annoyance, but just another set of interesting unobtrusive sounds to</page><page sequence="15">96 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies attend to, as interesting as the sounds of the biophony (frogs) or the geophony (wind in leaves and pines). Likewise, Thoreau sees his visitors at Waiden as producers of welcome sound. Human voices no longer strike him as an annoyance. In "Visitors," when he and a companion are uttering "the big thoughts in big words," Thoreau says they needed more room than his cabin could afford: that was one "inconvenience," he says, "of so small a house" (140). When pushing their chairs against opposite walls does not provide sufficient distance for their thoughts to set sail, Thoreau takes the philosophical conversation outside, "talking across the pond to a companion on the other side" (140). Inside the house, he says, "we were so near that we could not begin to hear,. ..as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each other's undulations" (141). Both by moving outside and by describing their conversation via a natural image, Thoreau manages to make human conversation seem like part of the biophony. This effect, though, is not for "loquacious and loud talkers," but only for those who speak "reservedly and thoughtfully." Then Thoreau takes talking sofdy to its logical extension: to achieve the greatest intimacy in conversation, "we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other's voice." After all, says Thoreau, "speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of hearing" (141). This is another witty example of the rhetorical trick of Thoreau's that Emerson complained about, his reliance on paradox. But it fits with Schafer's focus on the art of listening, and it ties in with his claim that all analysis of sound should properly begin and end with silence. This paradox is why Thoreau finds the Canadian woodchopper Alex Therien such good company: he is "so quiet and solitary and so happy withal... cousin to the pine and the rock" (146-47). In his calm repose, chickadees would light on him, a sign of how silence can help integrate even our chatty kind into the biosphere. When Thoreau was alone at the pond, or on the pond, he was not necessarily quiet all the time. In one of his loudest moments, Thoreau says that he "raises the echoes by striking with a paddle on the side of my boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and dilating sound, stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild beasts, until I elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side" (174). Mendelson reads this as Thoreau using sound to lay claim to his territory (92), which would make this scene an act of sound imperialism. But notice that his clamor elicits a response from the biophony and the geophony. He is perhaps a disturber of the woodland peace here, but imaginatively he sees it as a kind of play,</page><page sequence="16">Ian Marshall 97 like his chasing of the loon in "Brute Neighbors." In the evening he plays his flute and watches the perch, "which [he] seemed to have charmed" (174). In short, the sounds that he makes, the sounds that visitors to his pond make, even the sounds he can hear emanating from town - all these seem to accommodate themselves to the soundscape of Waiden woods, as natural and integral to the soundscape as the biophony and geophony. If Thoreau often describes anthropogenic sound via metaphors that in effect "naturalize" them, the process works the other way as well. He describes sounds of the biophony via analogies with anthropogenic sound. In "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For," a mosquito hums "an Iliad and Odyssey in the air, singing its own wrath and wanderings" (89). In "The Bean-Field" Thoreau writes of his planting and hoeing as a way of "making the earth say beans instead of grass"; so the Earth itself is perceived as speaking our language (157). Regarding the famous battle of red and white ants in "Brute Neighbors," Thoreau says it took place "without any noise that I could hear," but he imagines plenty of martial music as he watches: "their battle cry was conquer or die," he supposes, and he says, "I should not have wondered.. .to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their national airs the while" (229-30). By bringing in imagined anthrophonic sound to fill the silent biophony, Thoreau is breaking down the barriers between the two realms. We are not so different from our brute neighbors, suggests Thoreau: "The more you think of it, the less the difference" (230). Similarly, in "Winter Animals," the most biophony-rich chapter of Waiden , Thoreau describes a red squirrel who sits "in the top of a young pitch-pine, winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators, soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same time" - an apt description of Thoreau himself (274). In all these instances Thoreau anthropomorphizes animals, and so we might wonder whether he is indulging in the pathetic fallacy. But Neil Evernden in "Beyond Ecology: Self, Place, and the Pathetic Fallacy" has made the case that what is often dismissed as naive indulgence in the pathetic fallacy can be seen as a way of affirming connection between ourselves and other living things. That nicely suggests what Thoreau is up to in his anthropomorphic renderings of the biophony. He is articulating connection to the natural world, depicting his place in the world as a blend of human civilization and habitat of other living things. He demonstrates the artificiality of the dividing lines we have drawn between the two, and</page><page sequence="17">98 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies he suggests that we don't have to forsake our kind to live in the world and hear what it has to say. There is one more tactic Thoreau uses to blend the anthrophony and the biophony. At times, instead of using analogy to describe one in terms of the other, Thoreau focuses on the interaction of the two in order to produce a sound that cannot be classified as purely either anthrophonic or biophonic. For example, in "Winter Animals," he speaks of a "gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the road- side and play a strain on it wilder and more melodious, if my memory serves me, than any hunting horn" (280). The hunter is making music from a leaf (you may have done this yourself with a blade of grass held between your thumbs), a blend of anthrophony and biophony. The aim is sound, and it requires both the human breath and the vibrating leaf. And then of course there are times when there is a dialogue between the anthrophony and the biophony, as in Thoreau's "conversation" with red squirrels under his house in "Spring": "when I stamped they only chirruped the louder, as if past all fear and respect in their mad pranks, defying humanity to stop them. No you don't - chickaree - chickaree. They were wholly deaf to my arguments, or failed to perceive their force, and fell into a strain of invective that was irresistible" (310). This is funny stuff, with Thoreau "arguing" his case with his boot heels, and the squirrels arguing right back, winning the debate with the force of their own chickareed counter- arguments. What is striking about the dialogue is the metaphoric equal footing upon which it takes place. Both the anthrophony and the biophony have their say in the discussion and their chance to be heard. Thoreau's tactic of blending natural sounds with the anthrophony through the body of Waiden also applies to his descriptions of the geophony. In "The Bean-Field," for instance, Thoreau says, "When my hoe tinkled against the stones, that music echoed to the woods and the sky" (159). In "Economy" he complains about modern civilization's incessant hammering of stone: "To what end, pray, is so much stone hammered?" (57). Here in the bean-field the implement of technology striking against stone does not make for discord but for harmony. Thoreau very often compares sounds of the geophony to the sounds of human artifacts or people. In "House- Warming" he describes air bubbles in ice as "litde air- guns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop" (248). In "Winter Animals" the ice becomes near-human; he speaks of "the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow in that part of Concord, as if it were resdess in its bed and would fain turn over," a</page><page sequence="18">Ian Marshall 99 bedfellow "troubled with flatulency and bad dreams" (272). He continues: "or I was waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost, as if someone had driven a team against my door" (272-73). Thoreau is an amazingly attentive listener, and the volume of words (in number if not amplitude) lets us know how vital he takes the subject of sound to be. It is in "Spring" that Thoreau is most attentive to the sounds of the ice on the pond breaking up, and again he typically describes its sounds with analogies to the human realm. When he cracks the head of his axe against the ice, "it resounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a tight drum-head." Later when the sun hits it, the pond "stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually decreasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It took a short siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night, as the sun was withdrawing his influence. In the right stage of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great regularity" (301). A few pages later, the ice cracks "with a startling whoop as loud as artillery, as if its icy fetters were rent from end to end" (303). Gong, drum-head, yawning of a waking man, firing evening guns, artillery, breaking chains: these are all sounds of the anthrophony brought to the task of describing the "thundering of the pond" (301). And thunder, according to Schafer, constitutes the original "sacred noise": the attention-commanding voice of the creator (76). When the ice melts, its sound takes on a very different tone: Thoreau says a traveler is "cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing off' (304). One last example of the geophony analogized as anthrophony: When Thoreau finishes plastering his home in "House-Warming," he says that "the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then" (248). A "howling wind" is a common enough descriptor, but the portrayal of the wind politely accommodating his presence by waiting till his plastering is done, that's not. Thoreau perceives the wind as a very companionable natural force; he and nature are not in opposition. And that seems to be the message of his frequent attempts to humanize sounds of the biophony and geophony, and to naturalize the anthrophony: these need not be opposing forces. In this sense, attention to Thoreau's treatment of the soundscape may challenge our preconceptions about the apparent ecocentric movement of Waiden. In The Environmental Imagination , Lawrence Buell describes that movement as "a path from homocentrism toward biocentrism" or from egocentrism to</page><page sequence="19">100 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies ecocentrism (138, 155). But Thoreau's descriptive language regarding the soundscape, in particular the way the anthrophony is blended with the biophony and geophony, suggests that the shift is far from absolute, and these realms are not mutually exclusive. Rather, it is apparent from a focus on Thoreau's treatment of the Waiden soundscape that his concept of the ecocentric realm includes the human and is not entirely separate from it. That is his point, it seems. To live in a world amid our own voices and surrounded by the sounds of our own technology is clearly unsatisfactory. We need to be in contact with, and in dialogue with, the natural realm where the other voices and sounds of the planet can be heard - but where there is also space for our own. Perhaps this is not so much a challenge to the movement Buell traces, though, for Buell concludes that "the path to biocentrism must lead through humanitarianism" since we are only likely to shift to an ecocentric mindset if our "sympathetic bond" with the natural world "is activated" (386). Thoreau's blending of the sounds of anthrophony with biophony - and especially his rendering of the biophony and geophony in metaphors of human sound - may be precisely a means of establishing that sympathetic bond and helping his readers perceive the natural world not as a space apart but as a place where we belong. In "Conclusion," as he sums up the results of his experiment and recapitulates his reasons for going to live at the pond, Thoreau returns to the philosophical and critical tone of the opening chapter, his experience no longer grounded in the sounds by which he recorded life at Waiden. And once again, as in "Economy," the anthrophony is perceived as annoyance and treated with disdain. "The commonest sense," he complains, "is the sense of men asleep, which they express by snoring" (325). Even when the sounds emerging from human mouths are more articulate, he is no more receptive: "Some are dinning in our ears that we Americans, and moderns generally, are intellectual dwarfs compared with the ancients" (325). That "dinning in our ears" is the voice of received wisdom, or what passes for it, which Thoreau recognizes as dull, tired rhetoric. This is the anthrophony he has no use for, no longer filtered through the woods and thereby naturalized. This is the stuff to which the proper response is the aforementioned snoring. In one passage Thoreau expresses his frustration with the lo- fi soundscape of modern life, where signal is not distinguishable from noise, so clear hearing is not possible: "Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there reaches my ears a confused tintinnabulum from without. It is the noise of my contemporaries" (329). If there is hope here, it is in Thoreau's description of the lo-fi soundscape of the</page><page sequence="20">Ian Marshall 101 village as a "tintinnabulum," a tinkling, so it's not very prominent - meaning it does not disturb him overmuch. The tinkling description reminds us of what he says about bells, which are a sacred noise of his civilization, but to him, while at the pond at least, are heard only at a distance - he's close enough to be included in the acoustic community it encompasses, but far enough away that it does not dominate his soundscape. The "Conclusion," then, does offer hopeful notes. Speech does not need to be stultifying: "I desire to speak somewhere without bounds," says Thoreau. We can take the substance of the bulk of the book, the part about living at the pond, as a different sort of soundscape, as a place where he has been able to achieve the sort of unbounded speech he seeks. There sound - even the anthrophony - reaches his ears as harmony. He asks, "Who that has heard a strain of music feared then lèst he should speak extravagantly any more forever?" (324). The body of Waiden is his transcription of the music he heard at the pond. One last famous music metaphor also appears in the "Conclusion": "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away" (326). Obviously Thoreau has been one of those who marches to a different drummer, and he suggests that we can be too. It is telling that the alternative music he suggests we might hear is characterized as "far away" - again, close enough to be heard and so part of that acoustic community, but distant enough that martial music blends with the biophony and geophony. * Thoreau's recurring reference to appealing soundscapes as a kind of music suggests the pertinence of several key ideas from Krause's The Great Animal Orchestra. Krause's conception of the "Great Animal Orchestra" emerges from his "niche hypothesis" - the idea that each species in an ecosystem claims its own bandwidth where it can be heard (99). Insects may buzz in a low register, birds call in a high register. Each species has its acoustic space in a functioning ecosystem, and no one species dominates. That is the nature of the soundscape Thoreau finds at the pond, one full of what Krause considers the two "fundamental bioacoustic indicators": density (the number of creatures), and diversity (the number of species) (73). When all creatures play (or sing) their part, the result is symphonic, and sounds of the anthrophony can be part of it. One way of seeing</page><page sequence="21">102 The Concord Saunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies (or hearing) the problem Thoreau has with town is that the density of soundmakers there (us) is high while diversity is lacking: it's only one species making all the racket, thereby drowning out the rest of the soundscape. But Thoreau is not the misanthrope some have made him out to be. Once out of town, even we have a place in the Great Animal Orchestra - or the Ecosystem Choir. What are we to conclude after attending to Thoreau's descriptions of sounds in Waldeni Possibly that we can see the difference between his time and ours, measured in an increasingly lo- fi soundscape. We may perceive a decrease in our sonological competence as a result. Or - and this seems to me most likely - we see the acoustic powers of someone who dedicated himself to the art of listening, and so heard clearly more of what there is to hear in the world. Ecologists in our time have found a treasure trove of information in Thoreau's incredibly detailed Kalendar, which charted year by year the dates when plants blossomed and fruited, when spring birds returned from the south, when the ice melted from the pond. With this information, ecologists like Richard Primack have been able to track the changes in the ecosystem over the last century and a half - even seeing tangible evidence of the effects of climate change. So too does Thoreau's attentive descriptions of his soundscape allow us as acoustic ecologists to track changes in place from his time to ours. Nearly all the sounds he describes are soundmarks, distinctive and recognizable acoustic markers of a particular place. In this sense he is giving us a remarkable work of acoustic ecology - a whole ecosystem in a song, so to speak - and anticipating Krause's notion of the "soundscape's value as a window into ecological... literacy" (34). Thoreau's sensitivity to the soundscape, his detailed attention to it, and his linguistically inventive attempts to capture it in the medium of language give us all the more reason to admire his genius and his commitment to demonstrating how to live a life connected to the natural world. NOTES 1 . Other recent critics have focused on some special sources of sound in Thoreau's writing - the "telegraph harp" and echoes. On the "telegraph harp," or the sound of the wind passing over the telegraph wires that were installed around Waiden Pond in 1851, see Bock, Hodder, and Douglas Kahn. Kahn notes that Thoreau envisioned the telegraph wires circling the planet as a</page><page sequence="22">Ian Marshall 103 kind of earth-sized Aeolian harp, "as though this harp had been strung with the cartographic lines of longitude and latitude" (46). On Thoreau's fascination with echoes, see Hodder and Laura Zebuhr. Zebuhr argues that rather than being some kind of self- absorbed Narcissus looking at his reflection in the pond, Thoreau in Waiden - who unlike Narcissus is eventually able to tear himself away from water's edge - is riffing on the myth of Echo. Thoreau writes often of echoes in the Waiden soundscape, describing them as "partly the voice of the wood" (123), and Zebuhr stresses that the mythic Echo's soundmaking is made relationally, in concert always with the sounds produced by others. 2. As my biologist friend and colleague Carolyn Mahan has explained the passage to me, Thoreau's game of chase is really harassment of a nesting loon, and the cackling is a distress call.
