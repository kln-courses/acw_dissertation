<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amchitka, Alaska Toward the Bio-Biography of an Island Peter Coates Despite the recent international furor over French tests on the South Pacific island of Mururoa, the distinction of having sparked the loudest outcry against nuclear testing still belongs to a detonation on the Aleutian island of Amchitka in 1971. The conno- tations of its code name, Project Cannikin, were misleading. A cannikin is a small drinking vessel; the nuclear charge for Project Cannikin was housed in a cavern, fifty- two feet wide and more than one mile underground. At 5.2 megatons and $1i8 mil- lion, it was the biggest and most expensive underground test in U.S. history, ending a series that had started in 1965. When the role of the Cannikin controversy in the history of the anti-nuclear move- ment is assessed, the birth of Greenpeace will predominate.' Amchitka itself will fig- ure merely as the backdrop for a story dominated by people: atomic scientists, groups like the Alaskan Mothers' Campaign against Cannikin, and yippies aboard a con- verted halibut seiner. For most of those who so vehemently opposed Cannikin a quarter of a century ago, the place also was incidental. Amchitka was simply the test venue, a small is- land-42 miles long, 4'/2 miles wide at its broadest-considerably closer to Japan, China, and the Soviet Union than to the continental United States. Little was known of the island, save that it was located in a highly active seismic zone, was part of a wildlife refuge, and had wretched weather. Some activists were even uninformed as to the island's fauna; one reported shortly before the Greenpeace sallied forth in that fall: "We've discovered that it's impossible to get within even four miles of Amchitka on the Gulf of Alaska side, because, well, the island is famous as a sea-otter sanctuary, and the reason the sea otters go there, logically enough, is because of the kelp beds. These kelp beds are apparently something else."2 Unfamiliarity with Amchitka's natural history was matched by a meager under- standing of the island's human history. Prior to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's (AEC) arrival, it seemed, Amchitka had no past and no record of environmental change. This assumption was revealed in a remark by a Greenpeace founder when the AEC announced its decision to abandon the island in 1972: "Amchitka would</page><page sequence="2">120 140 160 18 160 1400 120 0 1000 . . . . . ..'I. . .I t &gt; . . . . . . a - a a c a' , a, a a Setl a&gt; ,'',,&gt; SIBERIA,{ . * Fairbanks: ...... 60~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...... .....

Amchitka's appearance in the Ameri- can public consciousness was late, but the processes of environmental transforma- tion had a lengthy history on the island. The visibility of such changes and the loss entailed is a separate matter. The inhospitability of Amchitka's climate and terrain, and the fact that agriculture, ur- banization, and industrialization bypassed it, have created an aura of wildness-even immortality-and lent an untouched and untouchable appearance. The island's re- moteness reinforces such impressions; the nearest people are two hundred miles away, at military bases on Adak and Shemya. The nearest civilian population is the native village of Atka, 270 miles to the east, while the first sizable settlement-Anchorage- is 1,450 miles distant. Natural forces apparently remain very much in control and this has obscured the repeated human onslaughts on Amchitka's biotic community and the extent to which people have left a lasting imprint. Amchitka provides more than just another compelling local study of the often brutal dialogue between people and the natural world. It also serves as a prism for examining how environmental histories are fashioned by various interested parties to suit their purposes. To downplay the impact of testing, the AEC and its researchers devised a story stressing the amount and depth of environmental change prior to the nuclear age. According to its chief investigators, "the ecology of Amchitka has a long history of human disturbance" and "it is only against this background that we can clearly identify and evaluate the additional impacts assignable to the nuclear test program."4 Another AEC official was more blunt, announcing the day before the 1969 Milrow nuclear test that "people can talk about the 'Rape of Amchitka' all they want to, the fact is, Amchitka has been raped before."5 In contrast, many of the critics who pinpointed the AEC's arrival as the crucial divide in the island's history over- looked previous change. A third position acknowledged that the extent of prenuclear disturbance blunted the case of the test's critics -in other words, that the revelations of environmental history did not automatically bolster the position of environmental activists. The main intent of this essay is to arrange the various environmental events on Amchitka into a hierarchy within an appropriate historical narrative; but address- ing the strengths and weaknesses of various advocatory environmental histories is a significant adjunct. First of all, it is wise to reflect on the value of islands to bioregional history, to mull over some definitional difficulties, and to establish the state of the sources available for the study of Amchitka. Islands and Bioregional History Islands offer a prime opportunity to respond to Dan Flores's exhortation to fellow environmental historians: It seems to me that the particularism of distinctive places fashioned by human culture's interpenetration with all the vagaries of topography, climate, and evolving ecology that define landscapes-and the continuing existence of such places despite the</page><page sequence="4">Amchitka, Alaska 23 homogenizing forces of the modern world -ought to cause environmental histori- ans to realize that one of their most crucial tasks is to write well what might be called bioregional histories. Central to this call for a new order of local and regional history is the Braudelian analysis of "deep time in a single place," as opposed to "wide geographic generaliza- tions in shallow time". Since 1945, ecologists, geographers, and historians increas- ingly have studied the impact of Europeans and their biota on tropical, subtropical, and southern hemispherical islands. With a few notable exceptions-such as Rich- ard White's study of Puget Sound's Island County-islands in the northern hemi- sphere and outside the tropics occupy a much lower profile in the literature.6 The island's appeal to the bioregional historian is obvious. A mountain range shades off into foothills and contains a multiplicity of ecological subsystems and microcli- mates; a river also spans a broad spectrum of life zones from headwaters to mouth. An island appears clearly defined and autonomous, promising a great escape from the regional historian's dilemma of establishing precise boundaries. Pondering the prob- lem of defining region, section and bioregion, Flores wonders whether Texas is "prop- erly Southern, Western, Southwestern, or just Texan."7 From literal insularity seems to flow all the advantages of studying a person, rather than the collectivities to which they belong. But, just as no person is an island, not all islands are truly adrift. Unlike the Galapagos or some other splendidly isolated oceanic island or island cluster, Amchitka has continental connections. It is one of many links in the Aleu- tian chain that arcs a thousand miles from the tip of the Alaska Peninsula southwest- ward toward Asia. The Aleutians represent the crest of a ridge of mountains, whose tips have metamorphosed into islands after sea level rose eight thousand years ago - only yesterday in geological time. The area's seismicity guarantees that Flores's gen- eral observation about the standard role of dynamism and flux in ecosystems -"the ground of the natural world is shifting and always has been"-applies quite literally.8 One Aleutian island, which Russian colonists christened St. John the Theologian, was born of an early nineteenth-century volcanic eruption: "flame, and later on smoke could be seen coming out of the sea. On the tenth day a small, round, whitish emi- nence appeared above the sea level and began to increase in size very rapidly."9 A lagoon eventually formed that attracted breeding sea lions. The ideas of climax and equilibrium, much treasured by environmentalists, have taken a beating recently. It is especially difficult to speak of "the balance of nature" in a relatively young, still highly volatile world whose biota are a mixture of Asian and American elements. In the 1930s, the biologist Olaus Murie characterized the Aleu- tians as a "melting pot for faunal elements from two continents not yet reaching an equilibrium."'l Problems of identity and community arise after all. Is Amchitka prop- erly approached as part of the Aleutians, southwest Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, the North Pacific, or as an entity in its own right? Americans may have given little thought to the Aleutians prior to World War II, but science already was well acquainted, thanks to a series of studies that began when the German naturalist, Georg Steller, accompanied Vitus Bering on his "discovery" of Alaska in 1741 and recorded the archipelago's flora, fauna, and peoples. According</page><page sequence="5">24 Environmental History to David Spencer, a biologist with almost three decades of experience (1948-76) as manager of Alaskan wildlife refuges, the cumulative wealth of knowledge has ren- dered this peripheral region "one of the better known corners of the globe."" The most meticulous and systematic of these studies are the most recent, undertaken by the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, and collected in The Environ- ment of Amchitka Island, Alaska. It runs to 651 pages of text alone. Battelle, a private scientific research firm, had been under contract to the AEC since the mid-196os in connection with public anxieties concerning testing on Amchitka. The AEC's an- nounced strategy was to conduct a so-called calibration test in tandem with "before- and-after" bioenvironmental studies, prior to carrying out larger tests.'2 Much of this AEC-sponsored research constituted basic botany, ornithology, ecol- ogy, archaeology, and anthropology of a high caliber. In their preface, the editors of The Environment of Amchitka Island, Alaska contended that "a good deal of funda- mental, and we hope new, information was gained about a little studied part of the world." The island might be ruined as a nature preserve in their view, but not as a laboratory for science. Twenty-three of the published compilation's twenty-six chap- ters were written without reference to the testing program; regardless of the self-serv- ing official conclusions drawn from it, even opponents of testing recognized the value of much of the work. In his advice to the Sierra Club on the feasibility of legal action to try to stop Milrow, an official of the Center for Law and Social Policy reflected on his discussions with interested parties in the Department of the Interior: "They re- vealed that they are not entirely happy to have the AEC on Amchitka, but they re- fused to reveal any particular anxiety and even suggested that they have learned so much environmental information from AEC studies of the Refuge that it may have been a boon to have had the tests at Amchitka."13 Contributing scientists sometimes expressed their gratitude to the AEC for facili- tating glorious research opportunities. The environmental historian today might con- cur with the editors' rebuff, in the preface to The Environment of Amchitka Island, Alaska, to those who "will say that it is a pity that it takes a nasty cause like nuclear weapons to produce the kind of detailed study that a place like Amchitka deserves." Instead, the editors stated, one should rejoice that "a necessary evil can nevertheless produce information of lasting value to mankind." Ages and Mortality of the Earth Flores has convinced us of the lasting value of bioregional history that tells "the story of different but sequential cultures occupying the same space, and creating their own succession of places."'4 Yet how should the budding bioregional historian organize the mass of data on Amchitka into an instructive narrative? What are the most suit- able metaphors for characterizing environmental change? How helpful is it, for in- stance, to conceptualize phases of bioregional history in terms of the periodization applied to human life: youth, maturity, old age? We might tentatively call this a bio- biographical approach, bio-biography addressing a more discrete and therefore even more distinctive physical and ecological unit than bioregional history. In an island</page><page sequence="6">Amchitka, Alaska 25 setting beyond Europe, this bio-biographical treatment might begin with geological birth and early biotic profile, moving through a discussion of the influences associ- ated with aboriginal prehistory ("youth"), colonial contact ("middle age") and the large scale transformation of the indigenous biotic and human community ("old age"). Intellectuals in ancient Greece and Rome viewed the earth as a mortal being who underwent a life cycle; they interpreted soil erosion, for example, as evidence of the wear and tear accompanying old age. There is some merit in this approach. In geo- logical terms, we can legitimately speak of landforms progressing from birth through youth, middle age, and senescence. Places are subject to the so-called ravages of time regardless of human intervention. Coastal headlands erode into arches and eventu- ally end up as tooth-like, cavity-ridden stacks; Amchitka has plenty of these. The rate of "ravage" is the essential issue. Bob Dylan's rhetorical inquiry in "Blowin' in the Wind"-"How many years does a mountain exist, before it is washed to the sea?"- can be safely answered with "Usually, a very long time indeed." With certain great exceptions-such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes-geological processes are so slow as to be imperceptible from a historical perspective and virtually invisible in terms of a single human lifespan. Another objection we can raise to a figurative schema adopting the stages of a life cycle concerns the implied inevitability of decline in environmental quality over time. Ecosystems and landscapes may be in a perpetual state of flux, more or less, but this reshaping of identity does not necessarily amount to terminal decay, let alone connote eventual death.15 After all, in counterpoint to the Greek inclination toward the linear theory of earth history, other ancients believed that if humans exercised care and attention they could guarantee the earth's immortality. Just as some people prefer rounded, ground-down ancient hills -to -raw, thrusting peaks, some cultures revere age as others worship youth and unripeness. In today's Western world, the quest for the secret of eternal youth, pursued obsessively by vari- ous fictional characters, has its parallel in efforts-no longer confined to actresses, rock stars, or Californians-to thwart the aging process through cosmetic surgery and organ transplants. In Aldous Huxley's 1939 novel, After Many a Summer Dies the Swan, the wealthy Jo Stoyte pins his faith on an elixir derived from carp gut. The catch, it transpires, is that while eternal life is attainable, it involves evolutionary regression to the primate stage, and the higher goal of eternal youth remains beyond reach. In contrast, processes of recovery and rehabilitation canoperate within the natural world to reinvigorate the body politic in ways unparalleled in human lives, real or fictional. Mindful of these caveats, I shall now test notions of birth, youth, maturity, old age, death, and restoration with reference to Amchitka. In the Aleutians, which divide the Bering Sea from the North Pacific, clear skies and temperatures above sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit are rare. Extreme cold and sea ice are unusual, however, because of the warming proximity of the Japan Current (Kuroshio) and a latitude identical to that of London, England. Yet persistent rain and vicious storms are the norm. Low temperatures, minimal solar energy input, high winds, and poor drainage permit only a narrow range of vegetation whose growth and caloric value are limited.'6 Apart from the native, two-inch-high dwarf willow, the only trees are three Sitka spruces that have hardly grown since they were planted</page><page sequence="7">26 Environmental History outside a former officer's club during World War II. Amchitka's faunal characteristics typify the small island. Freshwater and land-based avian life is sparse, and the Norway rat is the only land mammal; but coastal waters, bays, and cliffs are home to a profu- sion of marine mammals and birds. Interactions between human and ecological systems on Amchitka have been con- siderably less varied than on islands in Puget Sound. In fact, most of the agents of transformation,on those islands -introduced livestock, tree felling, agriculture, and tourism-did not figure on Amchitka. Amchitka's occupation has been intermittent, as well as thin, occurring in short, sharp, irregularly spaced bursts. The island prob- ably received its first human colonists directly from Asia about 2,500 years ago. Whereas the Alaskan mainland was sparsely populated away from the coast, estimates of precontact Aleutian densities are comparatively high, including five people per kilo- meter of coastline on Amchitka. This reflected a highly munificent marine ecosys- tem, connecting the area firmly to North America's Pacific coastal bioregion. Aleut villages were invariably coastal and the Aleut way of life faced outward. In their quest for sustenance, Aleuts literally left few stones unturned. Hunters, whose implements included bolas and nets made of seaweed, wore one-piece, waterproof parkas (kamleika) made of stretched seal gut over undershirts of seabird skins stitched together.'7 Archaeological work sponsored by the AEC in compliance with federal antiqui- ties legislation-shell middens being the main available evidence-indicated little change between the Aleut arrival and their first contact with Europeans. Both bona fide and AEC research have readily concluded that precontact Aleuts "were truly people of nature, because their subsistence activities and orientation to time were based upon the seasons, weather, tide levels, motions of the sea, movement of ani- mals, and the productivity of the sea.'"1 Storms precluded hunting in late winter and early spring, and food was scarce at times. Aleuts may well have experienced crises of subsistence due to environmental dislocation stemming from natural agencies. The volcanic eruption of Simushir Island's Prevo Peak in the early 1840s apparently "fright- ened away" the otters, much to the annoyance of Russian fur traders (promyshlenniki).'9 Earthquakes and tsunamis also can affect freshwater and marine mammal popula- tions through direct kills or habitat change. Environmental historians in general have devoted insufficient attention to how nature disrupts itself. Any assessment of vulnerability in the face of their natural surroundings is modi- fied by full recognition of Aleut technological capacities. Those skeptical of the al- leged ecological sensitivities of undisturbed aborigines often attribute the phenom- enon of "living lightly on the land" to rudimentary hardware; a low technological level left indigenes relatively powerless to inflict serious damage. Yet Aleut weaponry and transportation were highly sophisticated. The kayak (baidarka) allowed them to exploit entire shorelines and venture into open waters. Their Russian overlords could not improve on their skills. Given their mobility, the Aleut outlook was hardly insular. Since they were under no obligation to dwell as close as possible to their food, the quantity of sites uncov- ered by archaeologists on any given island does not necessarily reflect the status of its natural resources; they might be exploited by people from less bountiful islands that still offer better living conditions.2o The most suitable unit of study from the stand-</page><page sequence="8">Amchitka, Alaska 27 point of Aleutian bioregional history in the "youth" phase might well be the island group. None of this sits comfortably with the crude notion that nature dictated Aleut lives. Still, emphasis on the "possibilist" rather than "adaptive" aspects of their cul- ture should be tempered by stressing the obvious but easily overlooked: Aleuts could not affect levels of production in the sense that land-based peoples could augment game by firing forest or plain. Perhaps the most striking element of dependence was North American driftwood. On these treeless islands, wood was too precious to ex- pend on cooking, so Aleuts ate much of their food raw, saving their driftwood for harpoon shafts, house and boat frames, burial sarcophagi, and rainhelmets.21 Every animal an Aleut hunter took constituted loss in a strict and short-term sense, but game harvesting was sustainable. AEC researchers did not implicate the Aleuts in the chain of responsibility for ecological disturbance, finding "few detectable, long- term effects that we can document today" with regard to the existence, location, and quantity of species. Middens contain few otter remains, suggesting the absence of widespread overexploitation. Since the otter sits at the top of the local food chain, a healthy precontact population translated into a robust marine ecosystem. Many ot- ters means lesser numbers of their preferred prey, sea urchins.22 This, in turn, signifies an abundance of kelp, for large quantities of herbivorous macroinvertebrates can over- graze as surely as unchecked numbers of deer or cattle. Russian invaders encountered a more or less intact ecosystem. Their assault on its youthful integrity began with targeting its trophic species. Survivors of Bering's expe- dition limped back to Siberia in 1742 with otter pelts, unleashing a fresh bout of eastward expansion -a classic instance of raubwirtschaft that set the tone for the en- tire trans-Mississippi West. The "sea beaver" slaughter peaked between the 1760s and 178os. Protected by reefs and rock, Amchitka was never especially lucrative; only one spot, Constantine Bay, provided a decent anchorage.23 Traces of human history before contact are faint. According to a reliable nine- teenth-century observer, the last permanent settlement on Amchitka was abandoned in 1849.24 Today, the only testimony to the Aleut presence are the shell and bone fragments that erosive forces have washed onto beaches and the mound-like midden sites whose vegetational cover often stands out because of localized enrichment of soil nutrients. One AEC researcher characterized them as patches of "lush greenness with high tangles of the grass Elymus and prominent stalks of cow parsnip, Heracleum."25 Most prehistoric structures, made of organic materials, have biode- graded beyond recognition. Walls constructed from beach boulders have tumbled into loose piles and housing timbers resemble just more random driftwood. The response of colonial authorities to unsustainable exploitation of marine mam- mals was a modicum of regulation. In the 182os and 1830s, the Russian-American Company extended moratoria and other measures-closed seasons, quotas, fallow areas, and male-only harvests-from seals to otters. Such regulations were sufficiently effective to permit supervised harvests of seal and otter between the 184os and 186os. The trade's heyday ended, but the American purchase of Alaska in 1867 renewed the pressure. With few otters left in the Aleutians by 1900, public indignation concen- trated on seals. In 1911, Russia, the United States, Japan, and Great Britain, including</page><page sequence="9">28 Environmental History Canada, outlawed the profligate practice of pelagic or "high seas" sealing, because many seals sank once they had been shot. The Fur Seal Treaty also extended com- plete protection to otters, a fact often overlooked, perhaps because the otter clause smacks of an afterthought and because resumption of commercial otter hunting was quite unlikely. A further response to depleted stocks of valuable marine mammals was President William Howard Taft's executive order in 1913, establishing the Aleu- tian Islands Reservation "as a preserve and breeding ground for native birds, for the propagation of reindeer and fur bearing animals, and for the encouragement and development of fisheries."26 This order's most distinctive feature was its forceful com- mercial mandate; many previous refuges had been set up to provide little more than bird protection. Consistent with its established pattern of hostility to federal conservation efforts, Alaska's legislature urged revocation of the 1913 order, or at least the reduction of the refuge to the "very few square miles" needed to fulfill its enumerated purposes:27 Many Alaskans were excited about the potential for livestock, and certain islands were duly deleted in the late 192os. Although hunting was prohibited, Taft's order contained the caveat that "the establishment of this reservation shall not interfere with the use of the islands for lighthouse, military or naval purposes."28 As such, no one objected to withdrawals for lighthouses and naval bases. It is hard to be precise about the kind of military purposes envisaged but environmentalists eager to assert the illegality of nuclear testing in a wildlife refuge insisted in 1971 that coaling sta- tions were the installations Taft had in mind. The AEC obviously favored a looser construction and was quick to deliver a history lesson: "Many may not be aware the Executive Order...specified that this should not interfere with the use of the islands for military purposes." Legal advice to federal wildlife officials supported this stance: The AEC required no formal permit since "the 'use permit' was created in broad fashion by the Executive Order itself."29 Alaskan conservationists who knew more about the island than their counterparts in the Lower Forty-Eight were prepared, on occasion, to concede the validity of cer- tain AEC points, specifically the contention that the island was "damaged goods." Robert B. Weeden of the Alaska Conservation Society, in a 1969 strategy document on the society's approach to the AEC, argued that "our strongest pitch should be opposition to use of any other islands in Alaska. (However, if AEC must be in Alaska, they do less harm on Amchitka than on untouched islands or in the Arctic.)" In the wake of Operation Long Shot-the first nuclear test on Amchitka, in 1965-the Alaska Conservation Society had feared the AEC might shift its attention to Agattu, one of the most westerly of the Aleutians and considered much less spoiled than Amchitka. There were no rats on Agattu and foxes had been eliminated. Because the island had not served as a base during the Second World War, its terrain bore no scars.30 Weeden's reference to Agattu as fox-free broaches the issues of ecological rehabili- tation and restoration of youth. Foxes also had been eradicated on Amchitka, and this marked a dramatic reconceptualization of its value. The priority of the Aleutian reservation's managers in 1913 was fur. The Arctic (blue) fox was native only to some of the middle and eastern Aleutians. The more westerly islands, like many elsewhere, had been predator-free prior to European intrusion. But from the 1750s, the</page><page sequence="10">Amchitka, Alaska 29 promyshlenniki introduced the Arctic fox to western islands such as Amchitka. There was practically no fox management; only a minority were penned and fed. They were expected to live off the fat of the land and did. This scorched-earth policy, with its easy assumption of expendability, prompted Olaus Murie, leader of various govern- ment expeditions to the islands in the 1930s, to comment: "There seems to have grown a general vague feeling that a fox island is 'good for only so long.' Probably in many cases this coincides with the length of time the bird supply lasts." Although all terrestrial birds, being ground or burrow nesting, were at high risk, attention has fo- cused on cliff nesters exposed to nifty clamberers. As a naturalist observed in 1886: On some of these islands foxes of various kinds are numerous, hence, while they are excellent feeding grounds for the geese in the fall, the geese are compelled to rear their young on the nearer islets where the foxes cannot molest the young goslings.31 The paucity of birds, coupled with the otter's extirpation, seriously undercut the Aleut subsistence base, rendering them heavily reliant on fox pelts. The stocking of Amchitka in 1921 was designed to assist the nearest community on Atka. The cessa- tion of otter hunting boosted fur prices, and fox trapping was the major component in Amchitka's economy between 1925 and 1936. During that period, Spencer stated, the Aleutians chain was "a gigantic fur farm." Such were the long-term repercussions of trapping's halcyon days that, in an account written after the AEC quit Amchitka, Spencer identified the 1920S as the zenith of human activity in the Aleutians.32 Trap- ping also brought Amchitka's first twentieth-century structures -barabaras (half-bur- ied sod huts) that served as hunting camps. Though federal biologists registered unease in the early 1930s, reorienting man- agement priorities was not feasible until 1936, when intensifying ecological impact (foxes proliferated after trapping became unprofitable) meshed with a price collapse during the Great Depression. Specific objectives of subsequent Bureau of Biological Survey (BBS) studies-the most systematic investigations of the region to date-were to monitor seabird decline and gather information on the otter. By the 1950s, the Aleutian Canada goose was endangered and present only on a few islands that had always been fox-free. Raptors were indirectly affected as rampaging foxes appropri- ated their food, while sparser grass and more erosive soil reflected reduced guano input.33 Murie argued that wildlife was Amchitka's "ideal use" and recommended a change in status from fox farm to wildlife refuge.34 BBS studies in 1936, 1937, and 1938 formed the basis for a program to rehabilitate the otter and return the island to its pre-fox glory. The survey selected Amchitka as the project's flagship, as the island's heavily indented coastline sheltered surviving pockets of otter. Had war not intervened, otter expansion and fox decline would have been the highlights of island history between 1940 and the coming of the AEC. In 1942, Japan occupied Attu and Kiska-two hundred miles and fifty miles, re- spectively, from Amchitka, which the U.S. military selected as the advance fighter- bomber base in its liberation campaign. The Army Air Force converted the lower, eastern end of the island into an airfield. Constantine Bay appealed to defense plan-</page><page sequence="11">30 Environmental History ners for the same reasons it had attracted prehistoric peoples and fox trappers. Army engineers built docks, gun emplacements, aircraft hangars, and look-out posts; they laid gravel-surfaced roads and asphalt airstrips, and trails pounded by feet and off- road vehicles contributed more fresh landscape features. Gravel pits, many subse- quently used as dumps, pockmarked the terrain. The Army eventually erected facili- ties for 16,ooo troops, including 3,200 semi-cylindrical, Quonset-style "Pacific" huts and an unspecified number of wooden KD ("knock-down") huts. When the last troops shipped out in 1950, their legacy took the form of rodents as well as roads.35 The rats that came with the troops probably were "new" immigrants. According to Murie, promyshlenniki had introduced rats to the place they then called "Rat Island" by 1790. Rats on Atka tormented resident Aleuts so mercilessly that they retreated to rat-free Amlia Island. Rats thrive on human neighbors, and the well-provisioned GIs were far more desirable hosts in terms of garbage generation. The military's depar- ture did not precipitate a long-term crisis for the rats. Their location remains prima- rily coastal -shoreline boulders provide ideal protection -but they have since freed themselves from dependence on trash. Rats live mainly on plants and have spread to cover all areas providing adequate grass cover.36 Karl Kenyon, a federal wildlife researcher on Amchitka during the 1950s, has con- tended that rats wiped out the burrow-nesting song sparrow and winter wren. Alas- kans who supported Project Long Shot, the first Aleutians nuclear test in 1965, such as the editor-proprietor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, seized on this claim to assert that the rat constituted a far greater environmental threat than any H-bomb. His eye on wartime detritus as well as the rat's depredations, William Smith, AEC program manager on Amchitka, insisted in the run-up to Project Milrow that "the worst damage to the ecology had happened by 1950.'37 The Potential for Rejuvenation Questions surrounding the definition, measurement, and evaluation of environmen- tal change -not least, how to distinguish between transformation and damage -are vital talking points for environmental historians.38 Some ecologists prefer "perturba- tion" to "disturbance," "catastrophe," or "retrogression" when describing "biological or environmental events that produce successional upset, disaster, stress, or distur- bance to organisms or systems"- especially when dealing with non-human sources. The belief that perfection and eternity are to be found in an untrammeled natural order can obscure the reality-that some systems rely on regular disturbance for their essential features. Richard J. Vogl explains how rivers remain "eternally youthful" thanks to devastating floods that provide "periodic spurts of vitality" for organisms that otherwise would decline and be replaced.39 Still, there are more cases of non-human and anthropogenic disturbance causing stress and damage-at least in the short term-and especially on small islands. Any ecosystem is better equipped to recover from volcanic eruption, wildfire, earthquake, and glaciation than from the pressures of modern military-industrial society. Regard- less of whether natural or human factors are involved, it is hard to disagree with</page><page sequence="12">Amchitka, Alaska 31 William deBuys's conclusion that literal restoration of the pristine is unachievable. In the Sangre de Cristo mountains of New Mexico, he contends, it would be impos- sible to eliminate the rainbow and German brown trout in favor of the native cut- throat, or to uproot exotics such as Kentucky bluegrass and dandelions: the success of these immigrants is "irreversible ecological fact."40 Few would dispute that pristinity is essentially a metaphysical quality residing largely in the beholder's eye. Yet "restoration" is no more straightforward a term nor more tangible a goal, for this implies a return by a fairly direct route to the original state, whatever that may be. In these circumstances, it is safer to adopt more modest terms, and more attainable goals, such as "recovery" and "rehabilitation." "Recovery" can usefully be characterized as a return to a more "desirable" state by reducing undesir- able elements. John J. Magnuson has formulated his views with reference to the Great Lakes, where certain indigenous species have disappeared and total elimination of invasive items is not feasible. The best ecologists can hope for here is control of the undesirable and "a pragmatic mix of nondegradation, enhancement and restoration."'4 "Rehabilitation" of a species is a more likely proposition in an oceanic environ- ment. Provided lethal pollutants have not complicated the situation, changes in the sea can be less profound than changes in the land. Once buffalo were eliminated, cattle swiftly usurped their range. Likewise, native grasses and fishes have been dis- placed across terrestrial North America. But the otter's habitat around Amchitka re- mained vacant and in good shape, with hunting the only pressure to be lifted. Oblit- erating a single land-based predator such as the fox from an island is an easier proposition than expunging exotic trout or uprooting grasses in a continental setting. In view of prewar restoration plans, Japan's defeat did not mark the end of military- style activity on Amchitka. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service waged the next war- against the fox. Such a campaign was not unique to Amchitka, though it was distinc- tive to islands. Charles Elton was pessimistic about the prospects of these crusades, arguing that unless the "first small bridgeheads" can be destroyed, eradication is "a very rare event." "Usually, if an invasion has got really going," he continued, "it can only be dealt with by keeping the numbers within bounds, that is by control."42 Yet on Amchitka, the crusaders registered an unequivocal victory. The offensive gathered momentum in 1956 when the Fish and Wildlife Service showered the island with strychnine pellets concealed in seal blubber. Authorities announced an unqualified success in 1960 when they found no evidence of active dens or fox litters.43 As part of his argument that nuclear testing constituted a major setback to ecologi- cal recovery, a journalist gave the restoration work high marks: "Slowly, patiently, a handful of biologists and wildlife experts went to work. Within twenty years of the war, Amchitka was emerging as a classic example of what can happen when a major ecological interruption is replaced and the balance of wildlife and nature restored." Birds that had retreated to the periphery to raise their young started to reoccupy the island proper; the winter sparrow and wren also were back by the late 196os.44 Marine mammals already had enjoyed a substantial degree of relief with the wan- ing of Aleut subsistence hunting and curtailment of commercial procurement. Ru- mors of otter recovery received official support from studies in the late 1950S and early 1960s, which established that Amchitka had the largest Aleutian population. Recov-</page><page sequence="13">32 Environmental History ery was so spectacular that the Aleutian-wide estimate for 1973-38,00o otters-was about half the level-75,o0o-fixed for 1770-77. By the early 1970S, pre-1741 num- bers around Amchitka were considered "not significantly larger than at present." Al- though some biologists maintained that the otters of the entire Rat Islands group were in equilibrium with the marine ecosystem between 1940 and 1970, others ar- gued that the carrying capacity of Amchitka's range was breached by the early 1940S.45 The first efforts to alleviate local overpopulation, reflected in declining average weight, involved transplants to the Pribilofs in 1951 and 1959. Though culling was adopted as a palliative in 1968, transplantation remained the favored solution. Wild- life managers regarded Amchitka's otters-la percent of the entire North American population-as the seeds for recolonizing the species' historic range down to Or- egon. An ambitious project awaited the AEC's arrival: io percent of Amchitka's otters were relocated to southeast Alaska at AEC expense in 1969.46 Pandering to public affection for this playful, charismatic creature, and seeing it as a fine opportunity to parade their eco-credentials, the AEC produced a fourteen-minute film about the transplants. The Warm Coat was a highly anthropomorphic treatment that pivoted on the personality of otters and conformed closely to the Disney genre. Since the film barely mentioned the reason for the AEC's presence on the island, asserting that the cavorting creatures were now free from the "troubled memory of man," critics of testing dismissed it as a cynical propaganda exercise. The Atomic Age Dawns Over Amchitka After the 1963 Test Ban Treaty drove testing underground, the U.S. nuclear establish- ment chose Amchitka as an alternative to its traditional sites. Opposition to further testing in Nevada centered on the possibility of damage to rapidly expanding Las Vegas high rises.47 As well as being pronounced free from the complications of hu- man proximity, Amchitka was accessible by sea and air year-round; the availability of roads, harbor, airstrips, and other wartime facilities helped secure its place in the nuclear limelight.48 1965's eighty-kiloton Project Long Shot, carried out by the AEC's Division of Military Application in conjunction with the Department of Defense, was designed to provide data on the differences between a nuclear blast and an earth- quake or other natural shock. Improving U.S. capability to detect Soviet and Chinese underground tests, the AEC claimed, would help enforce the test ban. In view of the terrific earthquake that shook south central Alaska in 1964-still the most powerful ever recorded in North America-public fears revolved around seismic dangers. An upstate New Yorker wrote to Alaska's governor that "it don't look right to me. I am no brain. The brains tell us that along the Aleutian Islands is the earth's weakest crust. After what happened a year ago I would think NO-GO."49 Certain local wildlife officials, for whom testing violated the purposes of the wild- life refuge, and members of the Alaska Conservation Society (ACS), many of them biologists at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, also were uneasy about Long Shot. In August 1965, the Defense Department organized a trip to acquaint the press and conservationists with the project. It appears that of the ten conservationists invited,</page><page sequence="14">Amchitka, Alaska 33 only Alaskans accepted, and those who went along apparently were appeased. Frederick Dean of the ACS wrote that "unless unpredicted radioactive contamination of the ecosystem occurs at Amchitka there is relatively little likelihood of serious damage to wildlife interests." Recognition of the already compromised integrity of the island's ecology militated strongly against adoption of a hard line. Some months before Long Shot, Kenton described Amchitka to his superiors in Washington, D.C., as a "biotic wreck."50 Criticism following Long Shot turned on allegations that the explosion and associ- ated activities had scuttled efforts to reintroduce the Aleutian Canada goose -by scar- ing off the first tentative recolonizers-and on the release into water, eleven months after the underground blast, of tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen with a half-life of 12.3 years. The AEC's own damage assessment was limited to highly localized ter- rain disturbance from offroad vehicles, discharge of drilling waste, and minor disrup- tion of drainage patterns.5' The AEC was eager to confirm the bruised and sullied state of the island. Soft- pedaling the existing ecological value, between 1965 and 1971 an assortment of offi- cials resorted time and again to variations on the following theme, a generic rendi- tion of which ran: "The barrenness of the use is reflected in the animal life. There are only two use-dwelling mammals on the island, rats and man. The only fish found inland are the Dolly Varden char, three-spine sticklebacks, sculpin, and a few salmon."52 The AEC undertook no cleaning up after Long Shot, seeking to deflect accusations of responsibility for despoliation to previous occupants, especially the military. Point- ing to sprawling garbage dumps stuffed with wrecked planes and abandoned oil drums, the AEC stressed that parts of Amchitka already were junkyards. Responding to charges that AEC activities horrendously scarred the terrain, their researchers tried to divert attention from new roads and drill sites and refocus scru- tiny on existing elements of infrastructure. Although the AEC had enlarged the har- bor, renovated the runway for use by commercial flights, and upgraded the jeep trail running the island's length into an all-weather road, they insisted that the first cut is the deepest regarding vegetational disturbance and physical consumption of land. AEC researchers fixed the amount of terrain disrupted by preparations for Milrow at 0.7 percent of the island's total land area; they also pointed out that ten thousand men occupied the island at the peak of military use, compared to seven hundred during preparations for Cannikin. The primary impacts the AEC envisaged in the impact statement it prepared in accordance with the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act were minor habitat disturbances associated with construction. Even these intrusions were deemed paltry in the context of wartime upheavals.53 Support for such views came from an entirely unrelated quarter-the federal wil- derness assessors. To evaluate suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System, the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation provisions of the 1964 Wilderness Act required a review of all roadless islands and areas of five thousand acres or more within the national wildlife refuge system. Midden sites were not thought to detract from wilderness quality, but on the basis of wartime disturbances, 29 per- cent of Amchitka was declared inappropriate for wilderness classification in 1974. The report adopted a relaxed attitude to military debris, warning of the potential</page><page sequence="15">34 Environmental History counterproductivity of removal efforts with heavy machinery. Instead, its authors placed their faith in natural healing processes: "Time and the elements will ultimately elimi- nate these blights upon the lands."54 Though critics alleged that its purpose was to test Spartan missile warheads, the AEC characterized the one-megaton Milrow explosion in 1969 as a calibration test. The protest from old-style conservationists, the new environmentalists, peace groups, Native Alaskans, and Alaskans in general was much fiercer than in 1965. Sen. Gaylord Nelson, a Wisconsin Democrat and a strong environmentalist, believed that Milrow packed the potential for a worse environmental disaster than the recent Santa Bar- bara oil spill. He trained his ire on the illegitimacy of nuclear activities in a wildlife refuge. Apparently unaware of the qualification in the 1913 executive order, Nelson declared: I think it is rather ironic that if you go to Amchitka, which is in the heart of a na- tional wildlife refuge, you get a liffle brochure, that says, in part: "The fact that Amchitka is part of the national wildlife refuge makes it evident that hunting of wildlife of any kind is definitely prohibited, and any firearms landed on Amchitka will be immediately confiscated and held until the owner's time of departure." Through some incredible twist of logic, the regulations are bent to allow the biggest firearms of all, nuclear bombs. Nothing will ever convince me that a wildlife refuge and a nuclear blast go together.55 Many wildlife officials recognized that the nature of Amchitka's past deprived their cause of emotional and ecological clout. John Gottschalk, director of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, exhibited the same resignation that had characterized responses to Long Shot. "The contractors are not greatly concerned about little things like fish and wildlife standing in the way of their program," he testified. "But the fact remains that Amchitka is no longer really a wildlife area." George Laycock, a journal- ist who visited the island on an Audubon Society assignment in 1968, compared the "revulsion" an ecologist or naturalist would feel when contemplating the island scene to that of an artist "standing before an ancient masterpiece defiled by vandals." His article was entitled "The Beautiful Sad Face of AmchitkaYt, while Philip Carter of the Washington Post dubbed it "a scarred little, sad little island." Yet Laycock did not believe the existing damage justified writing off the island or treating it as a sacrifice. He still could hail the Aleutians as a whole as "a national treasure as surely as the Everglades or the Canyonlands." This remained the standard view among critics in 1971, many of whom continued to insist on Amchitka's pristinity. A Canadian woman composed a fairy tale for President Richard Nixon. The initial verses dealt with the president's search for a bigger and better toy and the desire to "try it out." His people were scared, "so he had to find a place that wouldn't scare his own people. The President had a brilliant idea. He owned some islands far away where the air was clean, the land was virgin and the waters crystal clear."56 Without too much journalistic license, an Alaskan reporter reflected in 1994 that "for a few days back in 1971, the attention of much of the world focused on the is- land." Cannikin was intended to test the performance of a warhead for the new Spar- tan antiballistic missile, designed to intercept hostile missile attacks. Like Milrow,</page><page sequence="16">Amchitka, Alaska 35 though to a far greater extent, Cannikin produced rockfalls, ruptured turf and tundra, emptied lakes, and otherwise altered drainage patterns and the face of the land. A thirty-acre lake formed where the test site area had subsided by twenty feet. Freshwa- ter fish died from shock waves and from being stranded in drained areas. Ocean fish, marine mammals, and seabirds also were directly killed; one thousand otters-per- haps as many as 15 percent of the area's population-had their ears split or skulls crushed. Some intertidal habitat and nesting sites were lost from uplift associated with ground motion; others were smothered with fallen rock. Robert Jones, manager of the Aleutian Islands National Wildlife Refuge between 1948 and 1976, blamed the disturbance associated with testing for declining numbers of teal duck and glaucous- winged gull, for the fact that the Asiatic whooper swan no longer winters on Amchitka, and for the disappearance of the returning Aleutian Canada goose.57 AEC researchers, however, detected nothing severe aside from facial scars, report- ing that "the most significant ecologic consequence is believed to have been the adverse effects of scattered terrain disturbance on the aesthetic quality of the Amchitka landscape, an effect which was severe in localized areas and which will persist for decades or centuries."58 Yet public fears went far beyond such cosmetic matters. AEC environmental impact statements sought to reassure critics that the depth of detona- tions would largely restrict radioactivity; tritium would escape into groundwater and ocean -although, supposedly, not until more than a century after the test-but con- centrations would swiftly be diluted to well below maximum permissible levels. Many Americans remained unconvinced, fearing Cannikin might fracture bedrock, allow- ing groundwater and radioactive materials to mix far more quickly than the AEC envisaged, either via direct venting or gradual migration to the surface, from where they would flow into the sea. Radionuclides then would be concentrated as they moved up the food chain, jeopardizing fisheries and marine mammals.59 The nuclear fears that gripped many Americans during the countdown, regardless of distance from ground zero, were poignantly expressed in a letter to a Native Alaskan member of Rep. Nick Begich's staff from a relative back home: I think they are trying to use us in Alaska for guinea pigs. Gee don't be surprised if we start having deformed babies in a few years from now. Gosh don't be surprised if we catch a two headed fish or any sea animal. Not only that Aleutian Islands is earthquake country. And if that blast triggers one of the main ones. Boy will we have tremors for a while. Maybe erupt a new volcano. And also cause tidal waves. It cer- tainly isn't going to feel safe to eat our native food after we know that the Blast has gone through.1- Such apocalyptic scenarios did not materialize. Though it yielded a tremor mea- suring 6.8 on the Richter scale and shot sea water high into the air, Cannikin did not engender an earthquake or tsunami, minor or major. Even Greenpeace acknowl- edged that it had been off the mark; a 1971 veteran admitted that "we had painted a rather extravagant picture of the multiple dooms that would be unleashed if Cannikin ever went off: tidal waves, earthquakes, radioactive death clouds, decimated fisheries, deformed babies.' The AEC not only denied serious ecological losses, it went on the offensive by</page><page sequence="17">36 Environmental History pointing to environmental gains. Human perturbations in nature can work to the immediate advantage of individual species. As Flores remarked in connection with Donald Worster's critique of Daniel Botkin's 1990 book, Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty-First Century, it would be overly paranoid to see an um- bilical connection between the ideologues of the new right and the "new" ecology that regards flux and disruption as the natural state. This is not to say that big business and agencies like the AEC will not endeavor to capitalize on and further such reori- entations within ecological science. In fact, the AEC's ecological studies at Amchitka, though hitherto unappreciated in this respect, can be located in the vanguard of these new tendencies, whose appearance Worster traces back to the mid-1970si2 In tune with an ecology emphasizing the role of rugged individualism and compe- tition in nature rather than community spirit, order, and cooperation, AEC research- ers stressed that faunal opportunists take advantage of increases in food supply. For instance, bald eagles gravitated toward the AEC camp at Amchitka, where AEC stud- ies showed a preponderance of nests in the early 1970s. Moreover, they calculated that eagle numbers rose after the 1969 test but were falling by 1974. AEC researchers focused on the amply replenished refuse dump; its closure in 1973 was the operative factor in this eagle fluctuation. They also drew attention to the scope for colonization flowing from disruption. Rockfalls generated by Cannikin may have destroyed some nesting sites and aeries but they also created potential new broods along the island's Bering Sea coast. These might attract birds not currently on Amchitka, such as auklets and petrels-birds that commonly relocate their colonies. Nature gives and nature takes away, as the old saying goes. The low beach that fringed the lagoon on the instant volcanic island of St. John the Theologian crumbled away before too long and the sea lions moved on.63 Plans to erase Amchitka's human history by removing buildings for the sake of wilderness restoration would prove detrimental to species that established themselves in a humanized environment. Gray-crowned rosy finches use frame buildings for nesting, and construction enhanced habitat for some birds in other respects. When huts were put up during the war, tundra and peat were scraped aside and banked around the base of the buildings. AEC avifaunal specialists were quick to point out that these embankments now host an unusually thick cover of native grasses, prob- ably as a result of improved drainage, and these clumps provide attractive nesting sites for Lapland longspurs and mallards.64 AEC biologists were particularly proud of Cannikin Lake, the island's biggest and deepest, as an environmental improvement. Dolly Varden char lived there by 1973. Even when no specific environmental betterment could be claimed, the AEC cat- egorized the perturbations caused by testing as aggravations of natural processes, such as subsidence: "downhill migration of peat, even on nearly flat ground, is a natural process, particularly evident at the tops of the sea cliffs, and healed cracks are com- mon." The platitude that nature takes care of itself was buttressed by the thesis that natural forces are far more destructive than any human power. An AEC expert, refer- ring to the standing menace of earthquakes, said in 1969: "Anything that our shot might do I believe very strongly would have been done many times over by these much more energetic and frequent natural occurrences."65</page><page sequence="18">Amchitka, Alaska 37 The AEC was no more responsible for triggering processes of environmental change on Amchitka than Columbus was for inaugurating them in the Western Hemisphere - yet this does not mean that all instruments of change are of a similar order. Environ- mentalists, environmental historians, and the AEC can agree that precontact Aleut impacts pale into insignificance alongside those of the fur hunter, soldier, fox, and rat. But the harmony ends there, and the task of assigning weight to radioactivity becomes part of a much larger difficulty, a problem aggravated by the environmental historian's dependence on AEC-generated science: How does one compare more readily identifiable and measurable environmental impacts characteristic of the prenuclear age-such as hunting, logging and biotic invasions-with the less visible yet more subtle and sinister impacts associated with chemical and agroindustrial pol- lutants that have become the hallmark of the modern ecological crisis, prompting some to refer to the death or end of nature. "In the past we have spoiled and polluted parts of that nature, inflicted environmental 'damage,"' William McKibben remarks; still, "we never thought that we had wrecked nature... .we never really thought we could: it was too big and too old. Its forces-the wind, the rain, the sun-were too strong, too elemental."" Radioactivity was a particularly insidious pollutant that could not be seen, smelled or tasted; a Greenpeace slogan from the early 1970S insisted on its reputation as "the ultimate pollution." After a brief appearance in the public glare in 1971, Amchitka reverted to its cus- tomary obscurity- until the U.S. government's release of previously secret informa- tion about Cold War-era nuclear testing. From a post-Cold War perspective, McKibben argued that nuclear weapons had lost the status they held in the early 1980s as the greatest peril to the natural world. Despite growing attention to global warming, however, nuclear contamination remains the most powerful reminder of the earth's mortality for many Americans. Various AEC studies in 1974, 1977, and 1982 identified only what the agency considered relatively harmless levels of tritium in water and plants; to date, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Pro- tection Agency, the federal monitoring authorities involved, also have denied that a contamination problem exists.67 Unpersuaded, environmentalists, Native Alaskans, and commercial fishermen are returning to the agenda of those who tried to halt Cannikin, demanding to know if radioactivity has infiltrated one of the world's rich- est fishing grounds. Meanwhile, most details surrounding the blast remain classified. Rubbishing History The primary purpose of this essay has been to construct a bioregional history. A re- lated, if secondary aim has been to experiment with the potential of a subspecies of bioregional history-bio-biography. An additional and equally connected theme has been that of contesting environmental histories. In their efforts to situate nuclear activities within a wider saga of environmental transformation, the AEC and its re- searchers-like their environmentalist opponents-were propagandists at worst. At best, they unwittingly became credible environmental historians, arriving close to the truth that might be expressed metaphorically: Amchitka is neither an untarnished</page><page sequence="19">38 Environmental History national treasure nor a rape victim. A less glib and journalistic conclusion-and one that returns us to Flores's desire to communicate the distinctiveness of a particular place, its personality, in bio-bio- graphical parlance-is that here is yet another spot that has been pummeled without suffering mortal wounds and that retains some of its integral character and appeal. White's closing thoughts on Whidbey Island, which experienced a comparatively intrusive, yet very different, human history, were that "in many ways it is still a pleas- ant place." Now "pleasant" is not an adjective readily associated with Amchitka, past or present- notwithstanding that the AEC's chairman, to allay public fears in 1971, announced he would bring his family along for the detonation, describing it as "a nice place for the kids to have a picnic." Harold McCracken, leader of an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Aleutians in the 1930S, actually liked Amchitka, but summed up what remains a near universal consensus by describing the Aleutians as "bleak, desolate, and dangerous."68 The gulf between the Aleutians and conventional notions of what is pleasant and nice in a place could hardly be wider, but these depend on where one is used to. Crawl inside the skins of the eighteenth-century promyshlenniki, as the popular histo- rian Hector Chevigny did, although he surely exaggerated their aesthetic sensibilities in imagining them to have been so captivated by bucolic serenity: "to anyone coming from a place such as Yakutsk, the Aleutians were as South Sea islands-treeless, all the wood coming by drift, but greenly beautiful in many places, with grass that grows so long it overhangs the cliffs into the surf, in which it waves like hair." South Sea islands may have occupied a special status in Western conceptions of paradise since the fifteenth century, but Eden need not be tropical-just pristine looking-as the association of Alaska and Antarctica with paradise over recent decades has under- scored. Moreover, at least since the romantic revolt against domesticated scenery, desolation has carried a considerable spiritual, biological, and aesthetic premium. The AEC's chief scientists on Amchitka certainly were not immune to its charms, recalling it as "a beautiful place in a grand, bleak way"; the Aleutians are now a birder's nirvana, an exotic destination for Audubon Society trips.69 Picnics at barren nuclear sites are hardly an outlandish proposition. The Trinity site at Alamogordo, New Mexico, location of the world's first nuclear detonation, has become a tourist attraction. Fifty years after the event, tourists buy commemorative T-shirts and baseball caps and get a kick out of devouring smoked oysters and bubbly at ground zero.70 Whether the sites of Long Shot, Milrow, and Cannikin will ever be marked by more than smart bronze plaques remains to be seen. Even without the addition of picnickers' cans and plastic wrap, there is enough junk in the form of Pacific huts and oil barrels to last an eternity. In his pioneering study of ecological invasions, Elton reflected that "the fate of remote islands is ;ather melancholy, even after one has made allowances for all the human excellence that has remained or developed again in some of them after our invading civilizations settled down."71 Elton had in mind agents such as livestock and deforestation, operating on islands like Hawaii and New Zealand. Yet Amchitka's fate is even more melancholy; it is hard to detect any signs of compensatory human excel- lence on Amchitka, save for the results of the endeavors of ecologists who possessed a</page><page sequence="20">Amchitka, Alaska 39 vision of how the island once was. Invadi-ng civilizations never settle down; in fact, they never had any intention of doing so. That leaves part of Amchitka a classic ghost town and abandoned fort, if less pic- turesque than those we are accustomed to in the American West. Never mind the ominous possibility of radioactive contamination; most impressive today, and most shocking, is war's legacy. Despite wooden telegraph poles, KD huts, and boardwalks, it is a ghost town that will take a long time to rot into oblivion. Perhaps this is just as well, for as Richard White has emphasized, environmental historians "have an affin- ity for trash as the evidence of human actions, the relics of culture."72 Why should we privilege log cabins and Aleut midden sites? Environmental historians should aim to be omnivorous and devoid of aesthetic qualms. Said the environmental historian to the ecological restorer: "Leave us our garbage. Leave us our history." Peter Coates is senior lecturer in the Department of Historical Studies at the Univer- sity of Bristol. He is author of The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Controversy: Technology, Conservation and the Frontier (University of Alaska Press, 1993), recipient of the West- em History Association's W Turrentine Jackson Award, and co-author (with William Beinart) of Environment and History: The Taming of Nature in the USA and South Africa (Routledge, 1995). Notes 1. Although he does not mention it, protest over Project Cannikin appears to be the great exception to Paul Boyer's general characterization of the late 196os and 1970S as a period of widespread public indifference and resignation regarding nuclear arms and related issues; see Boyer, "From Activism to Apathy: The American People and Nuclear Weapons, 1963- 1980," Journal ofAmerican History 7o (March 1984): 821-44. In many respects, the Cannikin protest was an offshoot of the anti-Vietnam War movement; the prolific demonstrations and massive media attention surrounding Cannikin suggest that, rather than eclipsing the anti-nuclear issue-during the early 1970s, at least-the anti-Vietnam War movement con- verged a good deal with the anti-nuclear movement. 2.

Although books about the Aleutians campaign of World War II rarely mention it, Japanese forces occupied Agattu as well as the better-known islands of Attu and Kiska. This neglect may be attributable to the brevity and minimal impact of this occupation (June-October 1942). Albert C. Spaulding, Archaeological Investigations on Agattu, Aleutian Islands, Anthropo- logical Papers, no. 18 (Ann Arbor: Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, 1962), does not refer to any wartime damage. The Japanese abandoned Agattu before any Allied landing there. 31. Olaus J.

Another Alaskan venue, Cape Beaufort, was considered but rejected. In the AEC's judg- ment, the major disadvantage of an arctic site was that "we knew there would be very great worry there about the biological chain that has to do with fallout to lichens, to caribou, to Eskimo which we'd seen before"-a direct reference to the shelving (1963) of plans for a nuclear detonation (ostensibly part of Project Plowshare, a program to demonstrate the use of atomic explosives for civil engineering purposes) at Cape Thompson on the Chukchi Sea. Moreover, high levels of radionuclides (such as strontium 90) in Eskimos, attributed to atmospheric nuclear testing, was an extremely sensitive political issue in Alaska during 1963 and 1964.

Mike Bradner, both quoted in Alaska Legislative Council, "Transcript of Public Hearing on the Atomic Energy Commission Milrow Test at Amchitka," Anchorage, 26 September 1969, -12, 1o6.

Since tritium is very light, it moves swiftly through water and is generally one of the first byproducts of nuclear testing to appear in the physical environment.
