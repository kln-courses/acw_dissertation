<plain_text><page sequence="1">OEDIPUS AND EXISTENTIALISM: LES GOMMES oF ROBBE-GRILLET BRUCE MORRISSETTE Viewed in retrospect, Alain Robbe-Grillet's first published novel, Les Gommes (1953), now appears remarkably prophetic of his later works (Le Voyeur, 1955; La Jalousie, 1957; Dans le labyrinthe, 1959). Far from constituting an uncertain, tentative experiment in a mixed genre (detective story cum "objectal" or chosiste descriptions), Les Gommes in reality established the archetype of the Robbegrilletian novel. In Les Gommes, as in the subsequent fiction of its author, an isolated protagonist completes a Vicoesque cycle which returns him virtually to the point of departure, where, beneath an appearance of identical outcome, destiny has been irreversibly altered. The fabled Gnostic serpent Ouroboros bites his own tail, and the variegated, aberrant, yet interlocked scales of his curled body form a cryptic series of elements each stubbornly existent in its "dtre-ld," its objectal, existential thereness.1 Although Les Gommes received praise from reviewers (Jean Blan- zat called it "un livre d'une surprenante autorit6"; Jean Cayrol wrote that it was "un roman altier ... un grand livre"), the novel remained unstudied until Roland Barthes, the first important exegete of Robbe- Grillet, put forth in two articles ("Litterature objective" and "Littera- ture litterale," both published in Critique) certain ideas that became guiding principles for Robbe-Grillet criticism. It was Barthes who sharply dichotomized Les Gommes by deliberately excluding from his scrutiny any "analyse argumentative" or discussion of the plot of the novel, and by directing his attention almost solely to what he terms the "dimension einsteinienne de l'objet" in Robbe-Grillet's descriptions of things. For Barthes, "l'objet de Robbe-Grillet n'a ni fonction, ni sub- stance"; unlike the classical object of fiction (as in Balzac, for ex- ample), the Robbegrilletian object has only an optical nature, and an existence in a "mixte nouveau d'espace et de temps." Brilliantly delineating the originality of Robbe-Grillet's object descriptions, Barthes at the same time, through the parti-pris of his one-sided inter- est, contributed to the development of the myth of Robbe-Grillet as a</page><page sequence="2">44 Wisconsin Studies pure chosiste indifferent to plot and human emotions, and intent only on filling his novels with minutely described but "gratuitous" objects. This misconception persists today among many critics.2 Not only did Barthes' writings on Robbe-Grillet create many of the critical categories by which his work has been analyzed and ap- praised; they also suggested to Robbe-Grillet himself the formulation of certain key notions that appeared in his so-called "manifestoes," such as "Une Voie pour le roman futur" (NNRF, juillet 1956), "L'Ave- nir du roman" (Critique, aout-sept. 1956), and "Nature, Humanisme, Tragedie," (NRF, oct. 1958). These ideas included the principle of remaining "a la surface de l'objet," the rejection of mystical or anthro- pomorphic analogies and correspondences, the interest in techniques of the cinema, the opposition to the ideas of "recuperation" and "trag- edy," and the attack on "la profondeur" and "la signification" in gen- eral.3 In turn, Robbe-Grillet's espousal of these doctrines was regarded as further proof of his reputation as an "anti-psychologist" intent upon "de-humanizing" the novel. Robbe-Grillet's situation in contemporary criticism is still confused in this respect, though there is evidence that an increasingly correct and coherent view of his works is beginning to emerge.4 Roland Barthes properly underlined in Les Gommes what he termed an effort to "regarder le monde . . . sans d'autre pouvoir que celui-la de ses yeux." If, as we must, we interpret "eyes" here as the eyes of a perceiving consciousness, we find Robbe-Grillet thus directly connected to the current of existentialist thought developed in France by Jean-Paul Sartre (especially to the phases represented by L'etre et le ndant and La Nausee) and by such phenomenologists as Merleau- Ponty ("Rien n'est plus difficile que de savoir au juste ce que nous voyons," writes the latter in his Phinomenologie de la perception, Paris, 1945, p. 71). The attack on profondeur and signification is an extension of the attack on the object-subject duality denounced by the phenom- enologists and existentialists on one hand, and by the American be- haviorists on the other. Barthes' prophetic designation of the reader of Robbe-Grillet in 1954 as a "voyeur" may actually have suggested the title of the novel Le Voyeur and influenced its conception.5 It is time to attempt a somewhat detailed scrutiny of the still in- adequately studied novel, Les Gommes. The first of the series of com- pact pridres d'inse'rer which Robbe-Grillet has composed for the back cover of his books describes the work in this manner:</page><page sequence="3">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 45 11 s'agit d'un e6vnement precis, concret, essentiel: la mort d'un homme. C'est un 6venement a caractere policier-c'est- a-dire qu'il y a un assassin, un d6tective, une victime. En un sens, leurs rbles sont meme respectes: l'assassin tire sur la vic- time, le d6tective re'sout la question, la victime meurt. Mais les relations qui les lient ne sont pas aussi simples qu'une fois le dernier chapitre termin6. Car le livre est justement le r6cit des vingt-quatre heures qui s'6coulent entre ce coup de pistolet et cette mort, le temps que la balle a mis pour parcourir trois ou quatre metres-vingt-quartre heures "en trop." 6 The tone of this account suggests an element of ingenuity or puzzle, which probably explains the attitudes of many early reviewers, as well as the selection of such a title for a foreign translation of the appar- ently meaningless title Les Gommes (literally, the "gum erasers") as that used for Spanish version, La doble muerte del profesor Dupont, which reflects the aspect of paradoxical plot. What are these twenty-four hours "in excess"? There are,in fact, two "circles" of twenty-four hours in Les Gommes, each of which could be considered a classical unity of time. The prologue begins at 6:00 A.M. and the epilogue ends at 6:00 A.M. the following morning with an- almost-identical scene. But the action of the main plot has begun with a first pistol shot at 7:30 P.M. of the evening before the morning of the prologue, and is concluded with a second (and fatal) shot fired at 7:30 P.M. of the evening before the morning of the epilogue. Thus two circular time spans overlap, or interlock; even the "classical" unity of time is split, syncopated, or doubled in a decalage of structure that is, as it will become apparent, reflected or reinforced throughout the novel by displacements and mutations in objects, gestures, itineraries or "parcours," and events. By simplifying, through synthesis, the multiple modes of narration employed in Les Gommes (mode of the omniscient observer; stream- of-consciousness and interior monologues; "discours indirect libre"; rearranged or reversed chronology; flashbacks and pseudo-flashbacks; "false" scenes presented literally; and the like) we may schematize for purposes of critical study a plot whose general movement, despite its involutions and its "return to the beginning," is conveyed in a relent- lessly forward direction (in contrast, say, to the plot of La Jalousie, with its more radical retours en arridre and its chronological echolalia). Sartre in his famous attack on the omniscient author formula (see</page><page sequence="4">46 Wisconsin Studies his article on Frangois Mauriac in Situations I) argued that an exis- tentialist writer must limit the contents of the novel to what actually "exists," that is, to what the characters perceive through their own con- sciousness, from the framework of their individual situations. Robbe- Grillet in Les Gommes follows this principle by presenting both action and background almost exclusively through the quasi-objectification of the mental content of a dozen characters: a caf6 proprietor; the would-be assassin Garinati; Doctor Juard; the merchant Marchat; po- lice chief Laurent; the "special agent" and protagonist, Wallas; the maid Anna Smite; the terrorist leader Bona; the witness Mme Bax; the riddle-propounding drunkard; the ex-postal employee Mme Jean; and the victim Daniel Dupont. The few passages that appear to belong to the mode of the omniscient author actually emanate from a kind of neutral chorus that constitutes, so to speak, an "observing con- science" related to the structure of the novel.7 The prologue opens at 6:00 A.M. of Tuesday, October 27, in the Caf6 des Allies on the Rue des Arpenteurs (note the theme of meas- urement and parcours, with its echo of Kafka's surveyor or arpenteur in The Castle), just outside the Boulevard Circulaire which, paralleled by a canal over two quarter-sectors of its route, runs around a city of Flemish atmosphere, a labyrinth of perpendicular and oblique streets cut across by canals, both lined with severe, identical fagades (pro- phetic of the decor of Dans le labyrinthe). Drawbridges, squares, foun- tains, and statues all have a conventional yet disquieting appearance. As he wipes a blood-colored area of a table top, the proprietor recalls events of the previous evening: someone had tried to shoot Daniel Dupont, the professor of economics whose house stands nearby; Dupont's maid Anna had phoned for medical aid from the caf6, since the professor's phone was mysteriously out of order. A stranger named Wallas had arrived in the night to take the caf6's one room for rent. Now another stranger arrives to ask for Wallas, who is no longer in his room. Two habitues enter the bistro; one, Antoine, has read that "Albert" Dupont was murdered last night; the other, a drunkard, tries to ask a riddle, but no one listens. The enquiring stranger, standing at a drawbridge looking down at the oily canal water, is identified: he is Garinati, a hired killer who last night in an attempt on Dupont's life succeeded only in wounding</page><page sequence="5">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 47 him in the arm. An almost imperceptible shift to past tenses indicates a flashback in Garinati's mind: following detailed plans given him by his boss Bona (as, we later learn, part of a program of political assas- sinations, each scheduled for 7:30 P.M.), Garinati enters Dupont's house, goes up to the professor's study, and there, as Dupont appears at the door, fires at his intended victim, who turns and flees. Seeking medical attention and refuge at Doctor Juard's clinic, Du- pont, in a scene which, though it occurred the night before, is written in the present tense, reveals his plan to escape the plot on his life. He will issue the news that he is, in fact, dead. Juard will sign the death certificate, and government officials at the capital will pretend to take possession of his "corpse," so that the local police will not dis- cover the ruse (they may, it is implied, be linked to the terrorist mob). Dupont needs certain papers from his study; his friend, the merchant Marchat, agrees to return to Dupont's house next evening to pick them up. Dupont's divorced wife will be informed by letter of her ex- husband's "death." As the prologue ends, Garinati goes to report to his chief. In his thoughts, he visualizes a return to the scene of his unsuccessful crime, in order to make a second attempt on Dupont's life. The drama begins. Wallas, standing at a bridge early this Tuesday morning, glances at his watch: it stopped last night at exactly 7:30 P.M. and refuses to run. Arriving by train from the capital around mid- night in this city which he vaguely remembers visting as a child, Wallas has found lodging at the caf6 near the scene of the crime he has been sent by the Bureau des Enqubtes to investigate. Wallas begins walking through the maze of streets, noting the cold brick facades, the curious motifs embroidered on the window curtains, an odd statue on the square. He loses his way and becomes entangled in a confused conversation with a woman concerning the location of the "center" of the city. His destination is the office of police chief Laurent, but before arriving there he stops in a stationery store to ask for a gomme, a gum eraser of special texture and quality, only to discover, as it al- ways happens to him, that there is none like it in stock. Wallas eyes the attractive girl clerk with evident erotic interest. At the commissariat, Wallas discusses the case with Laurent. The police chief expresses skepticism concerning the manner of Dupont's death, which he believes may have been a suicide. The victim may even be, since no one has seen the corpse, Albert Dupont, as reported</page><page sequence="6">48 Wisconsin Studies by one newspaper. Wallas produces a revolver; it is a 7.65 mm iden- tical to the murder weapon (Doctor Juard has reported the calibre of the bullet removed from the "dying" Dupont). Since one bullet is missing from Wallas' pistol, Laurent points out that Wallas himself could be a suspect. Visiting Dupont's house, Wallas has a difficult conversation with the nearly deaf Anna (who believes her master is dead) and carries off Dupont's own pistol, also a 7.65 mm with one missing cartridge. Alone in a bare room, Bona (Jean Bonaventure) waits for Garinati to arrive and make his report. Garinati, expecting to be reprimanded for his failure, is surprised to discover that Bona has accepted the news- paper account of Dupont's death. Can he, Garinati, be wrong? Is Dupont dead? Wallas learns from a witness living across the street, Mme Bax, that a man in a raincoat had appeared in front of Dupont's house an hour before the crime, and had tampered with the lock of the garden gate, despite interference from a passing drunkard. Returning to the caf6, Wallas is "recognized" by the drunkard, who relates the same scene, claiming that it was Wallas he accosted. Wallas in turn re- creates this scene in his imagination, projecting himself into it as the man in the raincoat. The proprietor decides to report Wallas to the police; Wallas, wishing to establish his identity, takes out his carte d'identit6, but he notices that the photo thereon, taken some time ago when he wore a moustache, resembles him so little that he hastily puts the document back in his pocket. On a streetcar going into the city, Wallas overhears two women discussing what seems to be an important story or event, but in terms so fragmentary and confusing that its significance escapes him. Leav- ing the tram, he finds another stationery store. Its window display consists of a dummy dressed as a painter standing before an easel on which may be seen a fine line drawing of the ruins of a Greek temple. Yet the "subject" in front of the painter, to Wallas' amazement, is a large photo-mural of Dupont's house, the scene of the crime. Wallas enters and again asks for his special eraser; he even manages to recall one syllable of its name. But again he must content himself with an inferior substitute. Again he looks with erotic interest at the woman clerk. Evasive childhood memories tantalize him. He sets out to- ward the clinic to question Doctor Juard. A literal (yet false) scene of Dupont's "suicide" fades into compli-</page><page sequence="7">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 49 cated speculations by Laurent, tending always nearer to the correct conclusion (that Dupont is alive). Here, in mid-novel, one becomes increasingly aware that the full knowledge given to the reader of Du- pont's true situation hides some developing mystery, and that the reader, instead of watching a group of characters uselessly struggling to discover what has already been revealed to him, is instead witness- ing the preparation for an unsuspected denouement. Laurent receives a visit from Marchat, who fears he will be killed if he returns to get Dupont's papers. Marchat visualizes climbing the stairs to meet his death in Dupont's study. Frightened at his vision and at the questions Laurent puts to him, the merchant decides to leave town without carrying out his mission to the house in the Rue des Arpenteurs. Eating lunch in a self-service restaurant, Wallas overhears an am- biguous conversation among three railway employees; their remarks seem related to the Dupont case. Sensing defeat in his investigation, Wallas broods. He recalls the bizarre requirements of his job as spe- cial agent: Chief Fabius (parodied from Simenon if not from Fan- tomas) had insisted, according to his rule, that the area of Wallas' forehead measure at least fifty square centimeters; when calculations showed that it fell short by less than one square centimeter, Wallas had been accepted on probation only. .... Informed that a man in a raincoat resembling the person seen by Mme Bax had been observed entering the post office, Wallas hastens there. To his surprise he is "recognized" and handed a letter. Open- ing it in Laurent's presence, Wallas reads, without understanding its contents, Bona's communicaion to a new hired killer, "Andr6 VS" ("VS" pronounced in French suggests "Wallas"). Andr6 VS is to re- place Garinati tonight for the tenth political murder (as the reader remembers from an earlier scene with Bona). Laurent dismisses the letter as unimportant, and resumes his speculations. Wallas stops in a third papeterie in search of his unfindable gomme. In an associative flashback whose values are reversed somewhat in the manner of a solarized print, he sees a painter standing among classical ruins painting a picture that is metamorphosed, as the de- scription develops, into a sharp photograph of the house of the crime. Suddenly Wallas realizes that the woman owner of the stationery story with the photo-mural must be Dupont's ex-wife. Interviewing Evelyne Dupont (for it is she) in the back room of</page><page sequence="8">50 Wisconsin Studies her shop, Wallas intently studies photographs on the desk showing a middle-aged man and a woman accompanied by a small boy. Some- one enters the shop; Evelyne goes to serve him. On her return she reveals that the customer has purchased a picture post-card of the Dupont house. Wallas hastens after the man, but loses him. A series of interviews with postal employees at Laurent's office leads nowhere, except to involve Wallas further in conflicting testimony identifying him as the man who has received incriminating letters. One of Laurent's inspectors presents in writing a new theory of the crime: Dupont has an illegitimate son who is probably the guilty party. A young man has been seen prowling near Dupont's house in company with a tough-looking friend. A literal (yet false) scene fol- lows in which Dupont is murdered by his son's friend, but this version also fails to convince Laurent, who imagines it. Doctor Juard awaits Wallas at the railway station, where he had made an appointment (to avoid letting Wallas into the clinic where Dupont is still hiding). Their interview fails to enlighten Wallas, though Juard has let slip words that could have betrayed his secret. On his return to the clinic, Juard learns that Marchat will probably not return for the papers at Dupont's house. In his room, Garinati rearranges certain statuettes and objects on the mantelpiece before the mirror. Descending to the street, he im- agines Bona visiting Dupont's house to verify the professor's death. When he draws from his pocket the post-card bought at Evelyne's store, the reader's suspicions are confirmed that it was Garinati who entered during Wallas' visit. The time of this section of the novel undergoes a curious compression when Garinati now contemplates a tug passing a drawbridge, in a passage virtually identical to the one which, forty pages earlier, had preceded the entire chapter. As night falls, Wallas recalls events of the day, mixing, distorting, altering them. He revisits Mme Bax. At the caf6, the drunkard en- gages him in an argument over the meaning of the word "oblique," and propounds his earlier riddle in several contradictory variants. Laurent receives a letter containing a photo of the Dupont house (which he does not recognize), on which is written "Rendez-vous ce soir a sept heures et demie." He shows the card to Wallas, who, with- out saying so, does recognize the house. Returning towards it, Wallas fights obscure memories. He sees himself standing on the steps of a ruined temple, playing some dim role in an elusive scene. Suddenly</page><page sequence="9">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 51 he remembers that the person his mother had brought him to see in this city, long ago, was his father. He stops in another stationery store in search of the gomme; again, failure. Abruptly, he decides to return to Dupont's study, convinced that the murderer will for some reason return to keep the appointment referred to on the post-card. There Wallas will capture the criminal and solve the case. Wallas' entry into the house of the crime, his climbing the stairs, his ingress into the study, all duplicate, with variations, those of Gar- inati at the beginning of the story. Wallas waits. In his office, Laurent at last deduces the correct "solution": Dupont is not dead. He tries to reach Wallas by phone at the caf6. The action begins to accelerate. At the clinic, Dupont decides he must fetch his papers himself; his entry into the house, despite his usual courage, is accompanied by a certain fear. It is nearly 7:30. Dupont, taking from a drawer the pistol that Wallas had replaced there only a few moments earlier, opens the door to his study. Wallas is there. Each man, at the sight of the other, fires, but the professor's pistol is jammed, and Dupont falls dead from Wallas' bullet. The special agent's wrist- watch, stopped for twenty-four hours, starts ticking again. The phone, lately out of order, rings. The call is from Laurent who, guessing that Wallas may have returned to Dupont's study, is eager to announce that he has deduced the truth-Dupont is not dead! As the epilogue opens, it is again early morning in the caf6. Gar- inati again asks for Wallas, whose surveillance is now his task. During the night, Garinati has visited the hospitals and clinics of the city, and has seen Daniel Dupont's body-so he had succeeded in his assas- sination after all! Wallas, sitting with swollen feet (how many kilo- meters has he walked in twenty-four hours?) on the edge of his bed, ponders his failure: he, the detective, has killed the victim. In the mirror he notices that fatigue and sleeplessness have restored much of the lost resemblance to the photo on his identity card. He will return to the capital and await Fabius' decision on his future. Antoine, who had claimed the day before that Albert and not Daniel Dupont had been murdered, triumphantly enters the caf6 with a newspaper proving that Albert Dupont has indeed been assassinated (the night before, Albert Dupont had become the tenth of Bona's vic- tims). Wallas vainly tries to get the drunkard to repeat his riddle, but the one the man now propounds is quite different. In an incoherent interior monologue, the caf6 proprietor mulls over his telephone con-</page><page sequence="10">52 Wisconsin Studies versation with police chief Laurent: something about whether a son of DuPont might have frequented his bistro. A whirling, lyrical passage takes the reader from the proprietor standing before his aquarium-like bar mirror into a distant, watery realm of "petits bateaux perdus sur la mer, ... les vieux tonneaux, les poissons morts, les poulies et les cordages, les bou6es, le pain rassis, les couteaux et les hommes." The circle of time has closed around Wallas, and the novel is ended. At a superficial level, Les Gommes may be read as an ingenious detective story with a surprise ending: something in the style of Trent's Last Case, or The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, in which the detective or protagonist is revealed in the end as the guilty party. (The same may be said, to some degree, of Le Voyeur, in which Mathias' guilt is gradually brought to light.) In the hastiest perusal, however, it must become obvious that innumerable elements in the dense pages of Les Gommes must constitute, if they are not merely gratuitous, hidden riches, cunning traps for the reader, ambiguous allusions to "some- thing else," reflections, displacements, doublings. .... A seemingly in- nocent passage taken from an early scene of Wallas' peregrinations epitomizes this aspect of the novel: ... il y a trois affiches jaunes . .. avec un titre 6norme en haut: Attention Citoyens! Attention Citoyens! Attention Cito- yens! . . . Le genre de litterature que personne ne lit jamais, sauf, de temps a autre, un vieux monsieur qui s'arrete, met ses lunettes et dechiffre avec application le texte entier ... se recule un peu pour consid&amp;rer l'ensemble en hochant la tate ... puis reprend sa route avec perplexit6, se demandant s'il n'a pas laiss6 6chapper l'essentiel. Au milieu des mots habituels se dresse 9a et l~ comme un fanal quelque terme suspecte, et la phrase qu'il 6claire de fagon si louche semble un instant cacher beau- coup de choses, ou rien du tout. (Les Gommes, pp. 42-43.) 8 To the multivalent phrases, allusions, and images of the text must be added the varying aspects or facets presented in Les Gommes by time itself. In destroying the linear advance of classical chronology as it is found in the traditional novel, modem authors have, as is well known, sought many objectives: to "recapture" the past (as in</page><page sequence="11">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 53 Proust); to create a multiple duration related to various personalities (as in Gide, Dos Passos, Virginia Woolf, and Sartre); to destroy the fixity of time through ambiguity (as in Faulkner); to mix past and present through interpenetrations (as in Graham Greene and Aldous Huxley); to expand a short span of a time-a day, a night-into a universal life cycle (as in the Joyce of Finnegans Wake). Robbe- Grillet's attempt in Les Gommes, related in some degree to many of these efforts, is to replace linear or clock time with what he has called le temps humain, the time that in our own ceaseless duration we pro- duce about ourselves like a cocoon, full of retreats into the past, repeti- tions, imaginings, and revisions, causing the same event to take on as many different aspects as there are moments in the lives of different observers. As in Einstein's theory of relativity, the moment of time and space, the frame of reference, varies with the observer and his point of view. Such a "human time" may properly be called existential time, since it exists only as a creation of the observer in his situation. Viewed from the standpoint of existentialist time, any of the "solu- tions" projected by the various characters of Les Gommes is, at the moment of its projection, possible if not true. A consequence is that external reality, like external time, becomes shifting, uncertain, hypo- thetical. This theme is sounded in the prologue: Bient6t malheureusement le temps ne sera plus le maitre. Enveloppes de leur cerne d'erreur et de doute, les 6venements de cette journ6e, si minimes qu'ils puissent etre, vont dans quelques instants commencer leur besogne, entamer progres- sivement l'ordonnance id6ale, introduire 9a et la, sournoisement, une inversion, un decalage, une confusion, une courbure, pour accomplir peu A peu leur oeuvre: un jour, au d6but de l'hiver, sans plan, sans direction, incomprehensible et monstrueux. (Les Gommes, p. 1) Even events that appear objectively false (for example, Antoine's belief that "Albert" Dupont has been murdered; Laurent's assistant's theory that the murderer of Dupont is his illegitimate son) may find external verification aprds coup, just as correct deductions (Laurent's belated conclusion that Dupont is still alive) may be contradicted by outcomes that revert (with subtle differences) to an earlier status quo. In a sense, the entire twenty-four hours of the main action is "outside of time" ("vingt-quatre heures 'en trop' "), as objectified or reinforced by the stopping of Wallas' watch from the moment of Garinati's shot to the</page><page sequence="12">54 Wisconsin Studies instant of Dupont's death when Wallas fires, returning the situation substantially to that which seemed to prevail the night before. Yet, though he accomplishes an act already presumed to belong to the "past," Wallas is not an aberrant, gratuitous intruder into a plot lacking in dynamic development. He is, in the truest sense, and al- though he never entirely realizes it himself, the protagonist in a drama of profound, if parodied, tragic irony. The story of Wallas in Les Gommes is a modem version of the tragedy of Oedipus. From its epigram taken from Sophocles' Oedipus Rex (which Robbe-Grillet slightly rewords to read, "Le temps, qui veille a tout, a donne la solution malgr6 toi"), through its prologue, five acts, and epilogue crowded with more or less hidden references to the Greek legend, its use of authorial "choruses," to the foredoomed outcome in which the man who has sworn to uncover a murderer finds that he himself is the criminal, Les Gommes owes its form and content in large measure to this powerful ancient story.9 Not only is there the ironic surface parody of one whose role is to solve problems (the Petit Larousse states that "le nom d'CEdipe est pass6 dans la langue pour d'signer les personnes qui savent trouver le mot des 6nigmes, la solution des questions obscures") but who "solves" it only through executing the victim whose murderer he seeks to detect. There is a much deeper image of man's condition, in which the ancient origins of Oedipus as a solar myth of day and night com- bine with the Freudian doctrine of the Oedipus complex to enable the novel to produce in the reader that singular and "profond remue- m6nage" of which Jean Cayrol wrote in his review of Les Gommes. No less a writer than Gaston Bachelard has flatly declared that "une oeuvre d'art ne peut guere recevoir son unite que d'un complexe," adding that if the complex is missing, the work, cut off from its roots, can no longer communicate with the unconscious. Les Gommes, like Robbe-Grillet's subsequent novels, follows this principle in its appeal to subconscious as well as conscious psychological demands.10 The example of James Joyce's Ulysses, which manipulates (as T. S. Eliot wrote in "Ulysses, Order and Myth") a continuous correspond- ence "between contemporaneity and antiquity" through its parallel use of the Odyssey and events in the lives of Bloom-Ulysses and Stephen-Telemachus, may have influenced Robbe-Grillet in his choice of a classic legend with mythic or archetypal overtones. The circular nature of the action chosen in Les Gommes, as well as the deep un-</page><page sequence="13">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 55 conscious significance of the Oedipal situation, may in turn be related to the cyclic and mythic structure of Finnegans Wake. At any rate, Joyce is one of few modern authors (with Faulkner, Kafka, Raymond Roussel and one or two others) to whom Robbe-Grillet is admittedly indebted. Support for the inherent relevance of such a, theme as that of Oedipus to the plot function of a novel like Les Gommes may also be found in the ideas expressed by W. H. Auden in his article "The Guilty Vicarage." Defending the serious underlying esthetic and psychological bases of the detective novel, Auden identified its com- mon properties with Greek tragedy: Concealment, Peripetia or Re- versal, Manifestation or Recognition, and Catharsis. Auden points out that "In Greek tragedy the audience knows the truth; the actors do not, but discover or bring to pass the inevitable"; such a statement might serve as a motto for Les Gommes. Normally, in the detective story, the audience is left ignorant of the truth to the end; in Les Gommes, the audience is at once aware of the truth (Dupont is alive) and ignorant of it (Wallas will kill him). The protagonist knows neither the true present nor the true future, but brings to pass what is inevitable.11 Oedipus allusions in Les Gommes form too extensive a network to be discussed exhaustively; only the most important will be studied. One of these is an elaborate development of the riddle of the Sphinx. After an initial but fragmentary statement in the prologue, this devinette, propounded by the drunkard, ("l'ivrogne-Sphinx," who also suggests Tiresias), returns in an expansion of ambiguous variations: -Quel est I'animal qui est parricide le matin, inceste a midi et aveugle le soir? ... -Alors, insiste l'ivrogne, tu trouves pas? C'est pourtant pas difficile: parricide le matin, aveugle t midi ... Non ... Aveugle le matin, inceste a midi, parricide le soir. Hein? Quel est I'animal? ... He, copain! Sourd a midi et aveugle le soir? ... (Les Gommes, p. 226) It is the version "blind in the morning, incestuous at noon, and parri- cidal in the evening" that best fits Wallas' case, since he is blind to the truth as he starts his investigation, covets his stepmother (and perhaps, sister) Evelyne at midday, and slays his father Dupont as night falls. The Egyptian Sphinx itself appears briefly in the shifting</page><page sequence="14">56 Wisconsin Studies configuration of pieces of floating d6bris on the surface of a canal; corks and pieces of wood form: ... un animal fabuleux: la tote, le cou, la poitrine, les pattes de devant, un corps de lion avec sa grande queue, et des ailes d'aigle. (Les Gommes, p. 27) The abandonment of Oedipus in childhood (Wallas evidently suffered a similar fate) appears in the motifs embroidered on the cur- tains of the windows Wallas passes: "sous un arbre deux bergers en costume antique font boire le lait d'une brebis A un petit enfant nu" (p. 40). Wallas even muses upon the "unsanitary" aspects of the early feeding of his unrecognized mythic prototype (p. 98). The theme of the abandoned or bastard child is gradually linked with the emerging memory of Wallas' childhood visit to this city (cf. pp. 36, 49, 126-127, and 231), to see a "relative." Paralleling this is the alter- native "enfant naturel" theory of Dupont's murder advanced by Laurent's assistant. The chariot in which Oedipus' father Laius was slain on the road to Corinth (cf. the "rue de Corinthe"), allegedly by a band of thieves (Bona's "bande" of terrorist assassins), stands on the Place de la Pr6fecture, unrecognized by Wallas: Au milieu de la place se dresse, sur un socle peu 61lev6 que protege une grille, un groupe en bronze repr6sentant un char grec tire par deux chevaux, dans lequel ont pris place plusieurs personnages, probablement symboliques, dont les poses sans naturel ne s'accordent guere avec la rapidit6 suppos6e de la course. (Les Gommes, p. 52) Passing the statue later, Wallas notes the inscription: "Le Char de l'ltat -V. Daulis, sculpteur" (p. 75), a name containing an anagram of Laius. In a streetcar, Wallas overhears two women discussing an event in the manner in which "les petites gens aiment a commenter les 6v6nements glorieux de la vie des grands criminels et des rois"; their remarks contain hidden references to Laius' chariot, to the proph- ecy of the oracle at Delphi that led to Oedipus' flight from Corinth, and to the danger of his unwitting encounter with his father (pp. 119- 120). Apollo, as the patron of oracle and prophecy, fits into a number of references. There is, on the mantelpiece in front of Garinati's mir-</page><page sequence="15">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 57 ror (Garinati himself is a sosie or mirror-image of Wallas), a statuette of "un beau lutteur [qui] s'appr&amp;te at craser un 16zard" (a theme of classic Apollo statuary), whose position relative to that of another statuette of a "vieil aveugle guid6 par un enfant" (Oedipus led by Antigone after his blinding) is subject to rearrangement and mirrored doubling (p. 209). When the drunkard engages in a lengthy argu- ment over the meaning of the word "oblique" (pp. 224-226), the ref- erences to oblique and straight lines are related both to Garinati's "ligne droite" preoccupations as he mounts the steps to kill Dupont (pp. 13-15) and to the term oblique applied in classical references to Apollo (loxias), because of the "obliqueness" of his oracles. Oracles, prophecy, and fortune telling are found in many allusions ignored by the protagonist and perhaps also by the reader. A news- paper headline, among others, reads "La voyante abusait de ses clients" (p. 54); the main post office becomes a sort of temple of mes- sages, a site of "de multiples rites, le plus souvent incompr6hensi- bles . .. [et] d'6critures sibyllines" (p. 184). The railway station is transformed into the abode of an undecipherable and terrifying oracle (p. 200). Nor is the oracular theme limited to classic parallels. The name of Jean Bonaventure (in French "la bonne aventure" refers to prediction of the future) suggests cards, and is thus related to per- haps the most hidden of all references in Les Gommes, those to the Tarot pack. The Tarot, whose images go back to medieval and earlier allegories, some uninterpretable (and whose "hanged man" card fur- nished a well-known passage in Eliot's Waste Land), includes twenty- two trumps or major arcana, twenty-one which are numbered, with one, The Fool, not numbered (The Fool is dressed like a king's jester, with cap and bells). We read, as Garinati ascends the stairs to Dupont's study: L'escalier se compose de vingt et une marches de bois, plus, tout en bas, une marche de pierre blanche, sensiblement plus large que les autres et dont l'extr6mit6 libre, arrondie, porte une colonne de cuivre aux ornementations compliquees, ter- min6e en guise de pomme par une t&amp;te de fou coiff6e du bonnet a trois clochettes ... Au-dessus de la seizieme marche, un petit tableau est ac- croch6 au mur, a hauteur du regard. C'est un paysage roman- tique repr6sentant une nuit d'orage: un 6clair illumine les ruines d'une tour; a son pied on distingue deux hommes couch6s,</page><page sequence="16">58 Wisconsin Studies endormis malgr6 le vacarme; ou bien foudroy6s? Peut-?tre tomb6s du haut de la tour ... L'ensemble parait de facture assez ancienne. (Les Gommes, p. 14) If the twenty-one wooden steps and the single stone step might appear coincidental, the figure of The Fool removes all doubt as to the intended parallel. The description of the picture over the sixteenth step, corres- ponding to the sixteenth trump card called La Maison Dieu, is equally conclusive.12 Moreover, far from representing a gratuitous insertion, the Tarot themes are carefully integrated into the novel. The fact that The Fool trump (normally considered as number twenty-two is, so to speak, at the bottom of the row (since its counterpart, the white step, is at the foot of the stairs), means that this card must be interpreted, in fortune telling parlance, as being "renvers6e." Here is the inter- pretation given by a current Tarot manual: LE MAT ... Renvers6e: Le Mat 6tant un personnage en marche, signifie qu'il est tomb6 ou qu'on rarrdte dans sa marche. (Ancien Tarot de Marseille, Paris, Grimaud, p. 55) Now it is precisely as Garinati steps toward the blank stone step that represents The Fool reversed, that there occurs the first example of the "frozen scene" or stopped action to be found in Robbe-Grillet's works (cf. especially Le Voyeur). Garinati, the "personnage en marche," is suddenly immobilized during a miniature instant of eternity: L'escalier de cette maison comporte vingt et une marches, le plus court chemin d'un point ' un autre. ... Soudain ... dans ce d6cor fix6 par la loi, sans un pouce de terre a droite ni t gauche, sans une seconde de battement, sans repos, sans regard en arriere, I'acteur brusquement s'arr&amp;te, au milieu d'une phrase ...

Mais, comme chaque soir, la phrase commenc6e s'acheve, dans la forme prescrite, le bras retombe, la jambe termine son geste. Dans la fosse, l'orchestre joue toujours avec le m~me entrain.</page><page sequence="17">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 59 L'escalier se compose de vingt et une marches ... plus . .. une marche de pierre blanche. ... ( Les Gommes, p. 13-14) Similarly, the conventional meaning of trump card number sixteen, La Maison Dieu, fits the author's designs through its general relevance to the Oedipus story. The Tarot manual states: LA MAISON DIEU ... Sens abstrait: Les constructions fic- tives des desirs de l'homme, qu'il croit 6difier fortement et que la flamme meme de son d6sir divore et ainsi entraine sa chute. Sens pratique: Projet brutalement arret6. Toujours, elle signifie coup de the'dtre, choc inattendu. (Ancien Tarot de Marseille, Paris, Grimaud, p. 40) When Wallas later ses the picture over the sixteenth step (as he ascends to play Garinati's role), one of the two men depicted takes on a defi- nite aspect of royalty (Laius the king): "L'un porte des habits royaux, sa couronne d'or brille dans l'herbe a c6t6 de lui" (p. 235). Among the Oedipus images and correspondences in Les Gommes, the temples and ruins of Thebes play a crucial part. Glimpsed first as the sketch in the stationery store window, Thebes, the "cit6 perdue" in which the drama we are witnessing originally unfolded, has, as it were, emerged from the streets and canals of the Nordic city that is its counterpart: Un mannequin . . . est en plein travail devant son chevalet. ... il met la derniere main a un paysage au crayon d'une grande finesse--qui doit 6tre en r6alit6 quelque copie de maitre. C'est une colline oui s'elkvent, au milieu des cypres, les ruines d'un temple grec; ... au loin, dans la vall6e, apparait une ville entiere avec ses arcs de triomphe et ses palais-trait6s, malgr6 la dis- tance et l'entassement des constructions, avec un rare souci de d6tail. Mais devant l'homme, au lieu de la campagne hell6nique, se dresse en guise de decor un immense tirage photographique d'un carrefour de ville, au vingtieme si6cle. ... . tout a coup Wallas reconnait I'endroit: ... c'est l'h6tel particulier qui fait l'angle de la rue des Arpenteurs. ( Les Gommes, p. 121) Wallas in a flashback later reverses this scene, inverting the relation of original to copy. The dummy painter now stands before the ruins of Thebes, and his drawing or picture undergoes a remarkable meta- morphosis into a photograph:</page><page sequence="18">60 Wisconsin Studies Les ruines de Thebes. Sur une colline qui domine la ville, un peintre du dimanche a pos6 son chevalet, 1I'ombre des cypres, entre les trongons de colonnes 6pars.

Au coin de la grille, les feuilles des fusains luisent au soleil, qui en accuse quelques contours. Par derriere, un arbuste d6passe au-dessus de la haie, un arbuste denude dont chaque branchette est marquie d'un trait brillant, du c6t6 de la lumiere, et d'un trait noir du c6t6 de l'ombre.

I1 [Wallas] suit h nouveau la fl&amp;che en direction de la pape- terie Victor-Hugo. (Les Gommes, pp. 167-168) An effort at mental deduction on the part of Wallas, related to the hidden problem of the protagnoist's identity and relation to the woman who may be his step-mother and sister, is here objectified; out of his solarized fantasy on the reciprocal relations between Thebes and the modern city, Wallas emerges aware at least that Evelyne must be Dupont's ex-wife. Finally, as Wallas approaches the act which will climax his Oedipal destiny, the protagonist senses dimly that he is, or has been, an actor in some ancient drama (the theme of the actor had already been stated in one of the Garinati passages cited earlier). A new effort at self-recognition, again objectified in terms of a Theban background, leads to another partial discovery: Wallas realizes now that the "rela- tive" his mother had brought him to this city to visit was in fact his father: La scene se passe ... sur une place rectangulaire dont le fond est occup6 par un temple (ou un th6itre, ou quelque chose du meme genre). ... Wallas ne sait plus d'oi lui revient cette</page><page sequence="19">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 61 image. I1 parle ... a des presonnages. ... Lui-m&amp;me a un r6le precis, probablement de premier plan, officiel peut-etre.

I1 a juste eu le temps de s'entendre dire: -Et il y a longtemps que cela s'est pass6? ... Wallas et sa mere 6taient enfin arrives enfin h ce canal. ... Ce n'est pas une parente qu'ils recherchaient: c'"tait un parent, un parent qu'il n'a pour dire pas connu .... C'tait son pere. Comment avait-il pu l'oublier? (Les Gommes, pp. 230-131) Each of the three visions of Thebes leads in the direction of discovery. At the first, in Evelyne's shop, Wallas almost recalls the name of the gomme he seeks (cf. below); at the second, he realizes Evelyne's identity (at least, in part); and at the third, he correctly identifies as his father the "relative" living in this city. Where an author using traditional techniques of psychological analysis might have described tortuous mental processes, Robbe-Grillet presents the mental content of his protagonist in visual, mythic objective correlatives that are at once (since they speak to our unconscious) beautiful and pro- foundly moving. At several points, the name of Oepidus itself almost breaks through to the surface of the text, or of Wallas' consciousness. Just as the name "Laius" was hidden in "Daulis," so the name CEdipe would seem to be the "mot illisible" in the letter to Andre VS "mistakenly" handed to Wallas at the post office, and which he deciphers variously as "ellipse," "6clipse," "6chope," or even "idem" (p. 160)-all words sug- gestive themselves of indirect destiny, death, "picturalization," and identity. The literal meaning of the name Oedipus ("swollen foot") is hinted at when Wallas' legs begin to swell from too much walking (p. 217), and mentioned openly when, after he has murdered Du- pont, Wallas observes that "ses pieds sont enfl6s" (p. 253). But it is the gomme that Wallas constantly seeks which has the most interesting rapport with the name Oedipus, for the name imprinted on this soft rubber cube cannot be other than "CEdipe." Since this gomme has come to represent among many critics the isolated or detached Robbegrilletian "thing" par excellence, the exemplar of the objectal, concrete objects whose meticulous geometrical description is one of the author's main specialties, it becomes important to know</page><page sequence="20">62 Wisconsin Studies why the gum eraser should have this name of Oedipus, and what the function of such an object is within the analogical matrix of the Oedipus myth in the novel. If there is a dichotomy in Les Gommes, then just as Descartes in his metaphysics of duality (thought and matter) found it necessary to establish a point of contact between the spiritual and the material at the pineal gland of the human brain, so Robbe-Grillet may be said to connect his two worlds-that of Oedipus plot structure on one hand, and of existentialist, chosiste background or texture, on the other -at the point represented by Wallas' gomme: -Je voudrais une gomme, dit Wallas. -Oui. Quel genre de gomme? C'est 1 justement toute 1'histoire et Wallas entreprend une fois de plus la description de ce qu'il cherche: une gomme douce, lIgere, friable, que l'ecrasement ne d6forme pas mais r'duit en poussiere; une gomme qui se sectionne avec facilit6 et dont la cassure est brilliante et lisse, comme une coquille de nacre. II en a vu une ... chez un ami. .... Elle se pr6sentait sous la forme d'un cube jaunatre, de deux h trois centimetres de c6t6, avec les angles ligerement arrondis-peut-6tre par I'usure. La marque du fabricant 6tait imprimbe sur une des faces, mais trop effacee pour etre encore lisible: on dechiffrait seulement les deux lettres centrales "di"; il devait y avoir au moins deux lettres avant et deux autres apres. (Les Gommes, p. 122) CE-di-pe, of course. But apart from its name, in its irreducible, stub- born, concrete mass of thereness this gomme, to an even greater extent than such objects as the door handle or chestnut-tree root of Sartre's La Naus'e, exists neutrally, apart from man, in the non-human world of things that hear no appeal from man and make no signs back to him. The gomme contains no mystic correspondences a la Baudelaire; it is not a symbol. Yet man, in Robbe-Grillet's system, makes of such objects the supports of his passions and thoughts; they become, not metaphoric talismans, but living embodiments of his emotions. Thus each attempt made by Wallas to find such a gomme is accompanied by passage of an erotic nature, directed at the woman in the shop; these become intensified in the case of Evelyne and constitute an objective correla- tive for the important incest motif. (Even Roland Barthes, who re-</page><page sequence="21">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 63 fuses to concede that Robbe-Grillet's objects have a "function," admits that the gomme is an "objet psychiatrique.") The gum eraser has two further modes of existence in the novel. First, through a kind of functional analogy, the gomme represents the self-defeating quality inherent in Wallas-Oedipus: a cube of matter that contains the principle of its own negation or annihilation in the idea of erasure. As it performs its function, it destroys itself.13 Both tangibly (eroticism of the soft substance) and ideologically (parallel- ism with destructive destiny) the gomme becomes charged with pro- jected feelings. Finally, the gomme fits into the system of mutations, metamor- phoses, doublings, and d6calages of objects which Robbe-Grillet in all his novels has ceaselessly depicted. Although the gomme is not part of such an extensive image series as that formed by the figure- of-eight objects in Le Voyeur (in which perhaps twenty different "things" are correlated among themselves and with the plot of the novel through their relation to the figure 8), the cube of gum rubber is placed in functional juxtaposition with another cube, the hard stone cube (a paper-weight) that rests on Dupont's desk. It is Garinati, Wallas' "double," who first sees this cube: Une sorte de cube, mais l6gerement d6form6, un bloc luisant de lave grise, aux faces polies comme par l'usure, aux ar&amp;tes effacees, compact, dur d'aspect, pesant comme l'or, sensiblement de la grosseur du poing. ... (Les Gommes, p. 16) Unmistakable similarities in phraseology prove the author's intention to equate these two materially opposite cubes (one "avec les angles l4gerement arrondis-peut-6tre par l'usure," the- other "16gerement deform . . . comme par I'usure, aux ar&amp;tes effac6es"). The cube of Dupont (the father) is large, hard, non-friable, suitable for conserv- ing papers and their contents; that of Wallas (the son with the tragic flaw) is soft, flexible, suitable only for the erasure of writings or draw- ings, and achieving its own destruction. When Wallas approaches Dupont's desk the hard cube undergoes a metamorphosis as it be- comes a correlative or support for the deed Wallas is about to accom- plish; it is seen now as a "cube de pierre vitrifiee, aux ar&amp;tes vives, aux coins meurtriers" (p. 236; italics mine). Moments later, Wallas kills his father.</page><page sequence="22">64 Wisconsin Studies If, as Robbe-Grillet has stated, there are influences and exchanges, even-in a non-mystical sense-correspondences between matter, space, and time, then objects, in all their heaviness, surface, and geom- etry, in their existence as phenomena, may be at the same time re- assuring and equivocal. They impose themselves at once on our per- ceptions, but only in order soon to become veiled in a halo, to become double asymmetrically superposed, subtly transformed. As they be- come the supports of man's passions, objects-like actions, gestures, words, and events-acquire multiple meanings. The multivalent gomme illustrates how we may pass from the Oedipus fictional structure of the novel (which may itself be vari- ously regarded as intellectual parody, mythic parallel, or psychiatric unifying principle) to its material texture of objects (aberrant, neutral, unstable, doubled, yet always linked by formal relationships into rows, pairs, or series). In the material universe of Les Gommes we again discover Robbe-Grillet's debt to existentialism, and his extension of certain of its principles. In his world of objects, Robbe-Grillet is a neo- existentialist. Readers will recall those passages in Sartre's La Nausee in which the hero Roquentin becomes acutely aware (to the point of nausea) of the thing quality of the stone on the beach, the ink bottle carton (a "parall6l6pipede"), the door handle, and the black chest- nut tree root; they will also remember the "neutral" or "cleansed" objects of Camus' L'Etranger (including the mother's coffin). Cer- tainly such passages strongly influenced Robbe-Grillet, especially those of Sartre, with their geometric terminology and use of a phrase which has become almost a motto for Robbe-Grillet, the "dtre-ld" of objects. But as Robbe-Grillet has pointed out, in his assessment of his rela- tionship and debt to these authors included in the article "Nature, Humanisme, Trag6die" (NRF, Oct. 1958), the objects of Sartre and Camus are not completely existential or phenomenological, for they repose constantly on anthropomorphic metaphor-if not on moral self- projection-and imply a Nature linked to man to form a "tragi-fied" universe. Instead of freeing man, as existentialism is supposed to do, such a view actually binds him to the old trammels of humanism: the recuperation of human misery, one-ness with Nature, even salva- tion through separation and tragic division. Unlike the objects of Sartre and Camus, those of Robbe-Grillet, despite their role as correlatives and their formal inter-relationships,</page><page sequence="23">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 65 never express an inherent or metaphysical bond between Nature and man. Nor are they, like the objects of Francis Ponge, conceived of as having "personalities" that the writer cunningly expresses. While critics have admitted that things in Robbe-Grillet are not, like Baude- laire's perfumes, mystically tied to man in secret correspondences, they have often failed to grasp that Robbe-Grillet's objects are not artificially invented symbols, either. In a conventional literary symbol (Mallarm6's cigar smoke as man's soul, for example), the process of symbolization involves recognition of an intellectual analogy of form, function, etc. For Robbe-Grillet, an object may convey passions or other aspects of man's existence for the sole reason that man can only exist through his perception of objects. Without images and objects to support his thoughts and feelings, man in Robbe-Grillet's view could not think, feel, or even exist, at all. The specific techniques of object descriptions in Les Gommes war- rant discussion. One is struck first by the accumulation of spatial, formal, and geometric terms, and by the precision of the localization of objects ("la chaise a 30 centimetres," etc.). The terms employed in Les Gommes include "ligne droite," "angle obtus," "carre," "cubique," "transversal," "rectiligne," "angle aigu," "segment," "taill6 en biseau," "spirale," "se coude a 90 degres," "quadrillage," and others, most of which will be found again in later novels, with many additions.14 The minute descriptions of Robbe-Grillet sometimes suggest trompe-l'oeil painting, "magic realism" (as in the paintings of Roy), or photography. Each of these analogies, however, would falsify or ignore the generic differences that always separate visual or pictorial representations from verbal descriptions. It is not really the visual image that the mind may form in reading such passages as the follow- ing, but the verbal reality, the pattern of words and phrases, that is important. (One proof of this essential distinction between a mental picture and a piece of writing is that no one, confronted with a pic- torialization of the following-even by such a master as Roy-could possibly recreate from the picture, independently, the actual phrases used by Robbe-Grillet-or he would be Robbe-Grillet himself!) We are in the automatic restaurant, where Wallas finds on his plate: Un quartier de tomate en v6rit6 sans d6faut, d6coup6 h la machine dans un fruit d'une sym6trie parfaite. La chair peripherique, compacte et homogene, d'un beau rouge de chimie, est r6gulierement 6paisse entre une bande de</page><page sequence="24">66 Wisconsin Studies peau luisante et la loge oi sont rang6s les p6pins, jaunes, bien calibres, maintenus en place par une mince couche de gelbe verditre le long d'un renflement du coeur. Celui-ci, d'un rose att6nue 16gerement granuleux, d6bute, du c6t6 de la d6pression inf6rieure, par un faisceau de veines blanches, dont l'une se prolonge jusque vers les p6pins--d'une fagon peut-etre un peu incertaine. Tout en haut, un accident ' peine visible s'est produit: un coin de pelure, d6coll6 de la chair sur un millimetre ou deux, se souleve imperceptiblement. (Les Gommes, p. 151) Such a virtuoso passage is not, however, a mere still life; it is more than an "objectal" exercise in literary materialization. For the author makes his object function to support the mental and emotional life of his character. A theme of uncertainty runs through all this preci- sion; not only is Wallas' perplexity embodied therein, but his protag- onist's defect, his tragic flaw, the fatal error he makes (all reflected elsewhere in such incidental phrases as "une petite place pour l'erreur," "la plus petite faille," "une tragique erreur," and the like) are evoked, as well as his absurd lack of "un seul centimetre" of forehead area: "il n'a manqu6 que cet espace derisoire." By such devices as syncopation and doubling, Robbe-Grillet not only links objects and their arrangements with the mental content of his characters, but also relates objects to each other. Consider the modes of relationship used to reinforce the theme of reflections (a prin- ciple so important to Robbe-Grillet that he has written a set of three "Visions r6flechies"). Formally paralleling the novel structure as a reflection of myth or tragic plot, reflections appear first in several mirror passages. As the caf6 proprietor stands before the aquarium- like mirror of his bar, we read: Dans le mirroir tremblote, dbji presque entierement d6com- pos6, le reflet de ce fant6me; et au-deld, de plus en plus h6si- tante, la kyrielle ind6finie des ombres: le patron, le patron, le patron. ... (Les Gommes, p. 2) This "reflected vision," obviously a correlative of the character's mus- ing over lost memories, is paralleled by Garinati's shifting of an object series before his mirror, as he seeks to sort out his own uncertainties</page><page sequence="25">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 67 (p. 209). But Robbe-Grillet does not limit reduplication, superposi- tion, and decalage to a "litany" of mirror reflections. As police chief Laurent toils mentally to disentangle the confused threads of the case, his fingers in their motion, exceeding the speed at which the eye can stop action, create a virtual volume expressive of an entropic chaos of analytical dizziness: Huit doigts gras et courts passent et repassent d6licatement les uns contre les autres, le dos des quatre droits contre l'int6r- ieur des quatre gauches. Le pouce gauche caresse l'ongle du droit, doucement d'abord, puis en appuyant de plus en plus. Les autres doigts 6changent leur position, les dos des quatre gauches venant frotter l'int6r- ieur des quatre droits, avec vigueur. Ils s'imbriquent les uns dans les autres, s'enchev6trent, se tordent; le mouvement s'ac- c6!re, se complique, perd peu ' peu sa regularite, devient bient6t si confus qu'on ne distingue plus rien dans le grouille- ment des phalanges et des paumes. (Les Gommes, p. 227) When Doctor Juard fearfully awaits Wallas in the train station, visual reflections and displacements are transmuted into their auditory coun- terpart of reverberations. These are progressively syncopated as they embody the increasing tensions of the character who perceives them: Une immense voix remplit le hall. Tomb6e de haut-parleurs invisibles, elle vient frapper de tous les c6t6s contre les murs charg6s d'avis et de placards publicitaires, qui l'amplifient en- core, la r6percutent, la multiplient, la parent de tout un cortege d'6chos plus ou moins d6cal6s et de r6sonances, oi0 le message primitif se perd-transform6 en un gigantesque oracle, mag- nifique, ind6chiffrable et terrifiant. ( Les Gommes, p. 200) Finally, words and phrases begin, in moments of anxiety, to come apart, to rearrange themselves radically. The telephone conversation between Laurent and the caf6 owner (reported quite "normally" on pp. 237-238) is recalled by the latter, who senses in it danger and per- secution. The verbal disintegration and recombination conveys a sort of paranoid seizure: ... Et pourquoi ce type du commissariat voulait-il lui parler, hier soir?</page><page sequence="26">68 Wisconsin Studies -Le patron, c'est moi. -Ah c'est vous! C'est vous qui avez racont6 ~ un inspec- teur cette stupidit6 au sujet d'un pr6tendu fils du professor Dupont? -J'ai rien racont6 du tout. ... -C'est vous qui avez racont6 cette stupidit6, ou bien c'est le patron? -Le patron, c'est moi. -C'est vous, jeunes gens stupidit6, professor au comptoir? -Le patron, c'est moi. -C'est bien. Je voudrais largement fils, il y a bien long- temps, pr6tendu jeune morte D'6trange fagon ... -Le patron, c'est moi. Le patron c'est moi. Le patron c'est moi le patron ... le patron ... le patron. ... (Les Gommes, pp. 257-258) Thus verbal patterns become verbal echoes, rebounding, recombining, transmuted into distorted reciprocity, until an identical phrase ("le patron ... le patron ... le patron") repeats and reflects a visual mirror image of 250 pages earlier, at the start of the work. It is above all its formalized universe of existential objects and their relationships that distinguishes Les Gommes from an ingenious parody of the detective story, or from a Pirandellesque drama of am- biguous personalities. True, one may discern in the work a tendency towards baroque conceit and over-elaboration. Other interests of Robbe-Grillet in 1953 reveal similar preoccupations. Not only was he interested in such writers as Simenon and Graham Greene;15 he sought out also, if one may judge by the book reviews he wrote at that time, novels and stories whose plots contained paradoxical re- versals rebounding against their protagonists. Thus the interest of Jean Duvignaud's Le Pidge, for Robbe-Grillet, lay in its story of "un mendiant poursuivi pour un crime qu'il n'a pas commis-mais si bien invente' qu'il le conduira quand meme au meurtre et a la mort." Else- where he describes with obvious relish the tale of an Italian resistance fighter whose invented account of having executed a Fascist leader assumes such proportions that the protagonist is led, first to make a film of the incident, and finally to realize that "la realit r6clame un vrai cadavre . . . ce sera le sien!" Robbe-Grillet's lasting interest in Kafka, less obvious in Les Gommes than in a late work like Dans le</page><page sequence="27">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 69 labyrinthe, is nevertheless revealed in such features as Wallas' help- less situation facing an ambiguous destiny whose rationale he cannot comprehend, and even in the (apparently) gratuitous aspect of cer- tain descriptive passages (cf. the stairways of Kafka, with their crum- bling paint, etc., which in Robbe-Grillet's words, although they may "lead elsewhere," are above all, "there"). What did Robbe-Grillet learn from the writing of Les Gommes? For one thing, he appears to have discovered in composing his first novel that the mode of multiple presentation (using points of view of many characters), although it corresponded theoretically to his views con- cerning individual facets of truth or time, and reality, produced an un- wieldy fictional structure whose effect on the reader was one of esthetic disunity. From Le Voyeur on, Robbe-Grillet will attach himself to the world of a single protagonist, a process that reaches its culmination in La Jalousie. He will discard authorial intervention, often used in Les Gommes and still detectable to a degree in Le Voyeur. He will increasingly objectify, in correlatives consisting of formally related ob- ject series, the mental content often presented in Les Gommes by more traditional methods of stream-of-consciousness passages or in- terior monologues. He will abandon the mythic plot parallel, though not before including briefly in Le Voyeur (p. 221) an island legend resembling the case of Mathias. On the other hand, Robbe-Grillet will retain and develop further nearly all of the features of form and style discussed above with respect to the texture of Les Gommes. He will expand and elaborate techniques used in the early novel to make of fictional time a psycho- logical time, a "temps humain," unrelated to that of clocks, and exhibit- ing all the characteristic manifestations of repetition, imaginary se- quences, overlaps, interferences, de'calages, and retours en arridre that have become associated with the art of Robbe-Grillet. An important distinction remains to be made. In speaking of Robbe-Grillet's existentialism (which might better be termed neo- existentialism), one must be careful to note that his doctrine has none of the moral implications of Sartrean choice, or of the social or political scheme of values implied by Sartre's concept of engagement. Robbe- Grillet makes no exhortation to "commitment," except, in his articles on the writing of fiction, to commitment to the art of novel-writing itself. Robbe-Grillet's existentialism is rather an extension of the phe- nomenalism of the early Sartre, with its distant echoes of Husserl. It</page><page sequence="28">70 Wisconsin Studies was not until the advent of the war that Sartre set about reconstituting values, and developed moral and political ideas into principles of dramatic and fictional composition, so that the notions of choice and self-creation became the armature of plays like Les Mouches and Huis clos, and of novels like those of Les Chemins de la libert4. In litera- ture, Robbe-Grillet chooses to be neither morally nor politically oriented. It is not surprising, therefore, that Sartrean critics, like Otto Hahn, have accused him of escapist estheticism stemming from (allegedl) childhood experiences. Such accusations betray a miscon- ception of art in general, and of Robbe-Grillet in particular, since as a public figure he does not hesitate to take sides on issues (he is, for example, one of the signers-along with Sartre-of the recent "liste des 121" affirming the right of French soldiers to refuse to fight against Algerians). Literature, if it discards propaganda, if it divests itself of meta- physical implications, if it avoids socio-political "realism" and the like may, one day, become what Robbe-Grillet calls "la litt6rature d'une societ6 reconciliee avec elle-meme." Surely no one imagines that Robbe-Grillet means by this some ideal of blandness, naivet6, or escap- ism. Literature will not be a case of l'art pour l'art, but of l'art pour 'homme. He means simply that the literary artist must be free, if he so desires, to choose themes not linked to social and political concerns of the day, to concentrate, as great literature has always done, on such problems of human existence as crime and passion, desire and jeal- ousy, disorientation and search. Such themes, like that of Oedipus in Les Gommes, will find expres- sion and embodiment in the world of neutral objects that constitute the only means by which man can feel, think, or act in a universe of existential phenomenology. Robbe-Grillet's earliest novel remains a strong example of his art. WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY 1 Robbe-Grillet's earliest project for a novel, as he described it to me, would have utilized a plot structure of 108 elements, like the 108 separate scales on the body of the Ouroboros, that symbolized variously the Universe (in the Hiero- glyphics of Horapollo), the endless cycle of metamorphoses (in the Gnostic doc- trine of the Ophite sect), and Time (in Ficino's gloss of Plotinus). In one hermetic version the scales of the Ouroboros are numbered so that the sum of two adjacent numbers gives the number of the following scale, which is followed by one num- bered in such a relation to the total 108 that the entire complicated series forms a unique numerical possibility. Robbe-Grillet considered distorting plot chron- ology by taking up the 108 elements in this staggered order, creating a fixed</page><page sequence="29">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 71 series or "row" as in serial or duodecaphonic music. In abandoning this artificial and baroque idea, Robbe-Grillet nevertheless retained both the notion of circular plot structure and the conception of serial images and their mutations, two funda- mental features of his fictional technique. In Le Voyeur, Mathias after his doubly circular itinerary around the island departs as he arrived in a state of highly dubious "innocence." The husband of La Jalousie is no further advanced towards a "solution" of his problem when, as the novel ends, he is still returning in his mind to events of the story's beginning. The narrator of Dans le labyrinthe begins with a "Je" which is left in Suspense until the final sentence closes with a "moi" which brings the story full cycle back to its point of departure. 2 This false view of his works has plagued Robbe-Grillet especially in England and the U.S. Time said of Le Voyeur that "the story itself and the characters are allowed to go hang," and that Robbe-Grillet would probably end up writing "a novel about a room full of furniture," featuring "the affair between the arm- chair and the ottoman" (Time, Oct. 13, 1958). Similar objections appeared in Time's review of La Jalousie (Time, Dec. 14, 1959). Philip Toynbee and John Wain have expressed about the same point of view in England. French critics unsympathetic to his work have compared Robbe-Grillet's novels to surveyor's records and catalogues for the Exposition des Arts M6nagers. Even serious students of his novels have tended to view them exclusively from the chosiste angle; J. Robert Loy writes that "Things come to life under his detached eye and seem to possess the only real existence in the work" ("'Things' in Recent French Litera- ture," PMLA, March 1956). Jos6 Maria Castellet expresses similar ideas in "De la objetividad al objeto" (in Papeles de Son Armadans, junio de 1957). One of the most perceptive critics of Robbe-Grillet, Renato Barilli, continues to regard Les Gommes as interesting mainly because of its objectal "texture," and affirms that its plot is irrelevant, "absurd", and chosen as if "by lot" in "La narrativa de Robbe-Grillet,"Il Verri, 111/2, 1959). In recent years, Robbe-Grillet has himself contributed to this viewpoint, in lectures and comments, by minimizing the sig- nificance of the story in Les Gommes. In Pretexte (janvier 1958, p. 100) he calls it "une intrigue de convention ... qui n' avait pour moi aucune importance." Such declarations must, however, be taken with extreme reservations. The analysis presented in this study will, I believe, show the true importance of the plot of Les Gommes for the Robbe-Grillet of 1953, and its place in the evolution of the author's ideas of what constitutes plot structure. See also Note 9, below. 3 I have discussed various aspects of these principles in articles already in print or scheduled to be published; see "Surfaces et structures dans les romans de Robbe-Grillet," French Review, April 1958; "Lecture de La Jalousie," Critique, juillet 1959 (reprinted in English in Evergreen #10, 1959, as "New Structure in the Novel"); "Roman et Cin6ma: le cas de Robbe-Grillet," to appear in Sym- posium; and "Vers une 6criture objective: Le Voyeur," to appear in Saggi e ricerche di letteratura francese, Milan. 4 Cf. the article by Barilli mentioned in Note 2 and two important recent articles which I have read only in manuscript: Otto Hahn's "Plan du labyrinthe," written for Les Temps Modernes, and Jean Ricardon's "Description et infra- conscience chez Alain Robbe-Grillet," written for the NRF. 5 Le Voyeur, according to Robbe-Grillet, was originally to be entitled Le Voyageur (the protagonist is alternately referred to as "Mathias" and as "le voy- ageur"). The word "voyeur" is not found in the novel, though the idea is present in at least two senses; cf. my article "Vers une 6criture objective: Le Voyeur," mentioned in Note 2. 6 It is interesting to note that Robbe-Grillet's cover notices always stress the story, and provide a guid3 to the interpretation of the novel. According to many reviewers of La Jalousie, one could never recognize the presence of a mute nar- rator without the clues provided by the pri&amp;e d'insderr. M. Blanchot (in Le</page><page sequence="30">72 Wisconsin Studies Livre de demain) complained that the "editors" had falsified La Jalousie in its cover notice, causing readers to assume the existence of a specific narrator, the husband, where there was only a "pure presence anonyme." Robbe-Grillet felt it necessary to reply to this charge in a letter pointing out that he himself had written the notice, and that the protagonist of La Jalousie was indeed a jealous husband and not an anonymous presence. The notices also emphasize surprise endings and stress the importance of a character's death. In the case of Dans le labyrinthe (which contains two statements, one prefatory and one on the back cover) Robbe-Grillet's use of the pridre d'inserer to disclaim all allegorical inten- tions has not protected him from critics who have, for example, identified the mysterious box carried by the soldier as his "soul," the physician-narrator as a "priest," etc. Barilli in his review of this novel (in Il Verri, III/6, 1959) uses Robbe-Grillet's request that the reader see in the novel "ni plus ni moins de signification que dans sa propre vie, ou sa propre mort" as an invitation to find in the work a systematic treatment of existential and phenomenological doctrines. 7 While the Sartrean principle referred to above by no means requires a unity of viewpoint (as demonstrated by the multiplicity of characters and angles of perception in Le Sursis, for example), it does presuppose the elimination of the author as narrator. This trend is of course related to the objectives of such realists as Flaubert and Maupassant. The realists wished to remove the author chiefly for esthetic reasons; the existentialists, for philosophic ones. After writing Les Gommes, Robbe-Grillet chose next to remain close to a single character in Le Voyeur (in which one may still detect vestiges of the "author") and in La Jalousie (which represents in this sense the culmination of Sartre's doctrine). Two main char- acters are developed in Dans le labyrinthe, using what might be termed a sym- biotic mode. 8 Robbe-Grillet's fondness for including in his novels a microcosmic example of the work as a whole, and a commentary on its interpretation, is found most dramatically illustrated in the native song and "roman africain" of La Jalousie, both of which give important clues to the writer's intentions. Cf. the article "Lecture de La Jalousie' mentioned in note 3. 9 Only Samuel Beckett, according to Robbe-Grillet, immediately recognized that Les Gommes was based on Oedipus. When most critics missed the point, the Editions de Minuit issued a pamphlet (written by Robbe-Grillet) to which I am indebted, entitled "Les Gommes." This brochure revealed the parallel and pointed out several details, including the most obvious, the riddle of the drunkard. Critics then began to mention the Oedipus legend in connection with Les Gommes, one of them (Jean-Michel Royer) even observing that Dupont was probably Wallas' father. Most of the allusions pointed out in the present study, however. have not (to my knowledge) been studied; nor has their function in the novel been correctly appraised. Bernard Dort, for example, suggests (in Les Temps modernes, ianvier 1954, p. 1335) that the reader should ignore "ces references dont ... Robbe-Grillet se joue et nous joue" and read the story itself superficially, avoiding the pieges or traps that the author has set for him. Such a view does violence to the esthetic unity of the novel, if it does not render the work incompre- hensible and absurd. It was Roland Barthes (who, oddly enough, does not men- tion Oedipus in connection with Les Gommes) who recognized that in Le Voyeur the protagonist's "discovery" of his own guilt. through his "conscience re-faisante," is also "proprement le th6me d'CEdipe" in "Litterature litterale," Critique, sept.- oct. 1955, pp. 820-825). 10 See Bachelard's La Psrchanaluse du feu and other works, and cf. Marie Delcourt's article "Mythovo6ticiue," NNRF, fivrier 1954, p. 305. For Robbe- Grillet's other works, see the articles of Note 3. 11 Cf. W. H. Auden, "The Guilty Vicarage," Harper's, May 1948, p. 407. Translation has brought this provocative article to the attention of European</page><page sequence="31">Oedipus and Existentialism: Les Gommes 73 critics, so that we find, for example, the Italian scholar Edoardo Sanguineti apply- ing Auden's analysis to Michel Butor's L'Emploi du temps, a novel strongly in- fluenced by Les Gommes ("Butor, 'une machine mentale,' " I Verri, 111/2, 1959, p. 49). 12 For those without access to a Tarot pack, the illustraions in Kurt Selig- mann's History of Magic, Pantheon, 1948, pp. 226 ff., will be useful. Seligmann describes Trump card sixteen as showing "two men precipitated from a tower struck by fire or lightning." So far as I know, the references in Les Gommes to the Tarot cards have not previously been noted. 13 On the metal store of a left-bank papeterie in Paris I saw the following ad- vertisement: TOUT S'EFFACE DEVANT "LES GOMMES" MALLAT. Ob- viously, the quotation marks would normally be either omitted or ,placed around the brand name Mallat. The literal appearance of "Les Gommes' perfectly en- closed in guillemets is an example, no doubt, of what Surrealists call "le hasard objectif." At any rate, Robbe-Grillet was fascinated when I showed him a snap- shot of the sign. 14 I had long considered that Sartre's use of geometrical terms (especially in La Nausde) was Robbe-Grillet's main source for this aspect of his descriptive technique. I now wonder if an important influence may not be found in French school texts in arithmetic. There is a striking similarity in tone between passages such as the following from Le Voyeur in one case and a textbook in the other: "C'6tait une borne kilom6trique du moddle ordinaire, parall61pipede rectangle raccord6 a un demi-cylindre de meme 6paisseur (et d'axe horizontal). Les deux faces principales--carr6s s'achevant en demi-cercle" . . . etc. (Le Voyeur, p. 191; cf. also the description of a buoy on p. 255). "Une borne indicatrice . . . se com- pose d'un socle en forme de parall6l6pipBde rectangle qui soutient une colonne cylindrique. Sur celle-ci repose un porte-panneau en forme de cube . .. [qui] a 40 cm d'ar&amp;te . . . " etc. (Arithmitique et travaux pratiques, par C. Lebosse et C. Hemery, Nathan, Paris, 1957, p. 152.) 15 I have written elsewhere of Robbe-Grillet's early fascination with Graham Greene, and pointed out the similarity of numerous plot elements in such works as Brighton Rock and The Heart of the Matter on one hand, and Les Gommes, Le Voyeur, and La Jalousie on the other. As noted in my "Lecture de La Jalousie," common elements in Brighton Rock and Les Gommes include: a weak, hunted character who arrives in a city and follows a more or less predestined parcours or itinerary; the atmosphere of a shady bar and its eccentric habitues; the ambiguity of a name and a character; an enigmatic verbal formula, repeated often; a gang leader with an Italian name; a professional man (lawyer in Greene's novel, doctor in Robbe-Grillet's) who is a terrified false witness; unexplained allusions to the violent death of a girl in the past (Molly, Pauline); advertising signs and posters (idiotic to Greene, formally significant to Robbe-Grillet); and even, in Greene's novel, an "object" which functions not only as a curious tacit correlative (like the gum eraser of Les Gommes) but also (perhaps) as an instrument of murder. This candy stick called Brighton Rock which when broken always shows the same letters, is however explicitly identified by Greene as a symbol of human nature, an idea alien to Robbe-Grillet.</page></plain_text>
