<plain_text><page sequence="1">The General-Election Ballot: More Nominees or More Representative Nominees?* John H. Bartont During the I968 elections more Americans became discontented with state and national electoral machinery than at any other time since the Pro- gressive era. The presidential nominating process was attacked both by dem- onstration and by legal action. Nominees of the major parties were denied the support of important elements of their own parties; third parties arose on the left and the right. In the wake of the election, reform of the electoral college system is being proposed and may be achieved. Yet the major source of discontent lay not in the fear that the presidential election might be de- cided in the House of Representatives, but rather in the fact that many Americans saw their preferred candidates rejected-not by the voters but by nomination processes that appeared arbitrary. As a result, the names that appeared on the general-election ballots left many Americans with no op- portunity to reveal strongly held political attitudes. The Supreme Court did move to meet the challenge by two parties of widely divergent political views that had been denied access to the Ohio ballot. In Williams v. Rhodes' the Court decreed that the Ohio American Independent Party, George Wallace's party, should be granted a place on the Ohio general-election ballot, but at the same time denied the Socialist Labor Party a place on the same ballot. The grounds for distinction are not fully clear. This apparent ambiguity may have stemmed from the opinion's rapid preparation necessitated by the impending election.2 How- ever, the ambiguity may simply reflect the Court's desire to maintain its flexibility toward future and more difficult election questions. Williams was the Court's first step in establishing constitutional standards for represen- tation of divergent viewpoints within election systems, a problem much more difficult than representation of different geographic areas. In the Court's earlier excursions into the election area, it had faced problems that * This Article derives from a paper prepared for Professor Robert Girard of the Stanford Law School.

To the extent that any group holding an identi- fiable political viewpoint has a consistently disproportionate voice in selec- tion of an executive or a legislature as compared to a group of similar size holding a different viewpoint with similar intensity, there is an identifiable inequality of political-spectrum representation. This Article will emphasize representation of political groups within a region that selects one representa- tive, a form of representation deeply affected by the processes for selecting the candidates whose names appear on the general-election ballot. It is the denial of this form of representation that was charged in i968 by the Wallace group and the Socialist Labor group in Ohio, and more generally by the liberal wing of the Democratic Party throughout the United States. Assuming that the Burger Court will, like the Warren Court, respond to claims of effective disenfranchisement-on looking at the current social environment, it is hard to imagine that it would do otherwise-the Court will face two possible courses for doctrinal development: doctrines that encourage third parties (as in Williams) or doctrines that encourage the major parties to represent divergent viewpoints more effectively. This Ar- ticle outlines certain responses the Court might choose in its post-Williams decisions and considers both their constitutional underpinnings and tlheir party-structure implications. The discussion in this Article is cast in terms of elections to legislative office rather than to executive office, in part because the legislative case is simpler, lacking for example the complications result- ing from the electoral college, and in part because the two-party system is more readily justified in legislative elections than in executive elections.5 More important, however, this Article has chosen the legislature as its focus to urge a change of direction in political reform efforts. Reform of the legis- lative election process may be more important than reform of the presiden- tial election process, for legislatures have held back executives in their ef- forts to respond to today's dissident groups.6 Only legislatures can fully rep- 3.

The concepts developed in this Article may be equally applicable to presi- dential nominations, but any such application would have to be made with great respect for the subtleties of the political and legislative relations between Congress and the President. 6. See J. BURNS, THE DEADLOCK OF DEMOCRACY 257-64 (rev. ed.

Finally, legislatures may be more able than the executives themselves to mobilize executive bureaucracies. There is probably little question that the Williams doctrine will be ex- tended to legislative elections. The hard question is whether Williams will be read only as requiring third-party ballot access or as also requiring that constitutional standards be applied to representation within major parties. Both of these are issues of political-spectrum representation, and will re- quire investigation of party structure. Under any doctrine, the Court will have to inquire whether particular groups deserve independent ballot rep- resentation. The case of the American Independent Party is clear enough, but what about a dissident major-party faction that does not like its party's nominees, or a black-power party with racially restricted membership? Like it or not, the Court will be enmeshed in the internal structure of politi- cal parties. Moreover, if the Court opens access to the general ballot, the structure of the major parties may change radically when factions choose the third-party avenue to political representation.7 This Article contends that as a matter of sound political theory and sound constitutional law, the Court should resolve the ambiguities of Williams by enforcing standards on the nomination processes of political parties while leaving the states con- siderable freedom to restrict the number of candidates actually on the final ballot. I. THE INTERESTS AT STAKE IN EXISTING NOMINATING PROCEDURES Before analyzing the Williams opinion, it is important to establish a framework describing the existing election system and some of the previous efforts to make it fairer. Although details of the system vary from state to state, election laws seldom explicitly support a two-party system. They do generally, however, define a two-step process of party nomination, with some participation by both voters and party institutions, followed by a gen- eral election. The party nomination process is most typically a primary election at which only registered party members can vote.8 A candidate's access to the primary ballot may be conditioned upon filing a petition containing a speci- fied number of signatures of registered party members from the relevant district;9 sometimes access depends upon endorsement by a party conven- 7. Note that if this does not happen-that is, if few third parties are created-those groups now believing themselves unrepresented will seek party reform through the courts all the more vigorously. See, e.g., Irish v. Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, 399 F.2d II9 (8th Cir. I968) (per curiam) (un- successful attack on districting arrangements for selection of delegates to the Democratic convention). 8. See, eg., CAL. ELECTIONS CODE ? 3 I I (West I96I). 9.

However, the party nominee for the general election may be chosen by a party convention rather than by a primary.1' Regardless of the mode, participation in the nomination process is normally limited to party mem- bers. The general ballot is then open to the party nominees, and may in addi- tion be open to those who file a petition signed by a relatively large number of voters."2 There may also be special arrangements exempting minor par- ties from certain of the regulations imposed upon the major parties.'3 The two-party system may have originated in the United States by acci- dent; its advantages, however, have become clear, and (outside the South) the procedures described above are designed with the expectation that they will permit the two-party system to continue, if not with the hope that they will foster it. The functioning of a two-party system is perhaps best de- scribed by contrast with proportional representation. A proportional repre- sentation system seeks to create a legislature that corresponds exactly to the spectrum of political views of the electorate. Thus, a vote of the legislature on any issue would yield the same result as a poll of the electorate. Such representation is often characterized by the election of a multiplicity of splinter parties, because the electorate will have a multiplicity of splinter positions. The difficulty is that legislative operation is often more a bargain- ing operation than a polling operation.'4 Coalitions of members (or of par- ties) will be formed to obtain legislation of benefit to the interests repre- sented. In order to build a coalition of the size necessary to pass legislation, bargains will be struck among holders of different viewpoints, thus adding new legislative goals of benefit to the new members. Since a huge number of such bargained coalitions is possible, no one coalition is very stable.'5 The result is often constant change in the structure of the governing majority, and, in a cabinet system, of the government itself.'6 In the United States two-party system, much of the bargaining between different political viewpoints is conducted before the general election, under the pressure of the need to obtain a victorious candidate. With the two-party system, the result is a higher probability of a stable and effective working IO. See, e.g., CONN. GEN. STAT. ANN. ? 9-382 (I967) (party-endorsed candidate). The party's rules must be filed with the secretary of the state. Id. ? 9-374.

Moreover, the system can provide more accountable representa- tion, because at the time the voter makes his choice, he has a better idea of the structure and goals of the coalition that his vote may help bring to power. There is, however, a problem: There will be many constituents who will not be represented in the final choice of a candidate and a governing coalition. This, in itself, is unavoidable. The remedy for those who are un- heeded in one election's preelection compromises is to make themselves heard more forcefully in the compromises preceding the next election or to influence governmental policy through the strength of their interest groups. The situation is more serious, though, when a substantial group is ignored repeatedly in a series of compromises within the election processes and lacks the resources to influence the legislature's decisions after that body has been elected. Preelection compromises, which involve many interrelated factors and complex judgments,17 are extremely difficult to regulate in order to pro- tect minority positions. Two kinds of approaches have evolved in the United States (at least outside the South): encouragement of the two-party system itself and development of the primary. Under a two-party system, it is in the interest of the opposition party to collect support from those fac- tions that believe themselves not currently represented. The minority in opposition must necessarily look to positions outside its party to expand its scope. On the other hand, when the state requires a primary, the party re- sponds directly to its membership in its choice of nominees. Thus, each of these approaches attempts to ensure that the major-party nominees repre- sent a reasonable compromise among a broad variety of political factions. The maintenance of the two-party system is usually an implicit objective of state election legislation.'8 Through the use of grandfather clauses and severe filing requirements in the alternative, many states deny party pri- maries and general-ballot nominees to parties without a history of partici- pation in previous elections.'9 Several arguments can be made in favor of I7. Part of the problem can be seen simply by examining where and how the compromises are made. For example, a candidate may be drawn to a party by a lifetime affiliation, an ideological com- mitment, a direct request by party activists seeking a man in the particular district with a particular viewpoint and appeal, or even a pragmatic decision that a position he wishes to promote can be most effectively promoted within the particular party. No matter how the candidate enters a party race, his selection will be affected by, and will in turn affect, the network of ideologies, voter loyalties, organi- zations, financing sources, research sources, and endorsement patterns that make up a political party. These intangibles, together with the facts that the legislator is often running on the same ticket with more newsworthy statewide or national executives and will typically define many of his positions in terms of the latter's positions, imply some uniformity among the positions represented by the nominees of different districts in one legislature and provide some confidence in the character of the governing coalition. A different form of bargaining may go on within a district as the candidates compete for financial support, endorsement, organization, or particular voter blocs. In this bargaining, the candi- date may modify his position to appeal to special groups, or, if he finds himself competing for the same resources as another candidate, may be forced to withdraw. See, e.g., V.0. KEY, JR., SOUTHERN POL- ITICS 4I5-I6 (I949). I 8.

There is a greater likelihood of a strong opposition candidate, capable of unseating an incumbent, if the op- position can be cemented into a coalition. There are fewer dangers of vote splitting in which two candidates with similar platforms divide what might otherwise be majority support for that position; the result of such vote split- ting could allow a minority candidate to gain enough votes for a plurality, thus rendering the final result unrepresentative.20 The two-party system is often justified on a deeper basis as well: that it tends toward moderation and continuity. Each party has a base of support regardless of which candidate it nominates. Hence, as long as these fixed bases remain roughly in parity, the Republicans and Democrats will seek to woo moderate and independent voters. The candidates actually chosen will then be representative of this moderate, independent position and will re- flect changes in the electorate in a gradual manner.2' If this theory is correct, it may explain some of the frustrations of those believing themselves unrep- resented. Moderation and gradualism may be virtues in selection of an exec- utive or of legislative majorities. But given the rapidity of current social change compared to the gradualist tendencies of a legislature with a con- tinuing structure (whether or not formally expressed in a senority system), it would be well if some immoderate representatives were chosen! An additional form of legislation relating to the nominating process has been the attempt to promote "intraparty democracy."22 The classic device is the primary, elaborated by such procedures as requiring that the official party organization remain neutral during the primary,23 or requiring direct or indirect election of the party officials. The object of this legislation is to make party nominations more responsive to the party electorate than they would otherwise be. Like attempts to achieve labor-union democracy, the effort has not been entirely successful. Political bossism can enter into cam- paign finance and organizational support in the primary election just as into a nominating convention. Requirements of party neutrality are avoided 20. The logic of vote splitting applies equally well to a multiparty system in which candidates are "evenly" spread across the political spectrum, although there is probably no way to define "evenly." 2I. There are serious questions whether these effects of the two-party system actually occur. For example, when the party is in a minority position and more readily dominated by ideologically com- mitted voters, the party's candidate is less likely to be chosen to appeal to the moderate groups. Con- sider Goldwater's primary victories in I964. Even when the candidate is chosen by politically astute professionals, the majority actually sought is most likely to be composed of the hard-core party mem- bers together with, not the moderates, but particular blocs that may be alienated from the other party. See S. LUBELL, THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN POLITICS I90-96 (3d ed. rev. I965). Financial reasons may give some blocs more bargaining power than others. Moreover, when a majority coalition is assembled, as in 1932, it is likely to survive many elections, only to be suddenly displaced by a new coalition. Thus, there are relatively few closely fought election contests that place the incumbent's position in enough doubt that he or a challenger will make serious efforts to enlarge their political bases in the direction of the moderates. 22.

However, the candidate's self-interest will help solve the first of these problems, and the ideological aspects of political parties and their role in voter indoctrination will generally help solve the second problem. Efforts to make the candidate-selection process fairer and to regulate preelection bargaining have not been entirely successful. As shown by the emergence of groups claiming that they are denied representation within the two-party system, the American political system has lacked the flexi- bility needed to respond to the changing American political environment. Today there are people in the United States nearly ready to revolt. Al- though these groups are in minority positions and will not be able to achieve all their goals in any event, they nevertheless deserve a voice in affairs-at least sufficient to ensure that legislative compromises often reflect their spe- cial concerns-and it is a statesmanly necessity to give them such a voice. They do not now have this voice, either through elections or through post- election legislative efforts. Groups claiming that they are effectively disenfranchised are likely to ask for one of two remedies: easing of restrictions on ballot access for minor parties or assurance that dissenting viewpoints within major parties are more effective in influencing party positions. If the problem were only one of representing fixed viewpoints, it is not clear which remedy would be better.25 However, viewpoints are not fixed, and it is clear that groups, es- pecially those concerned that they will end up unrepresented, will more readily coalesce around a candidate in an election from which a clear office- holding victor will emerge than in an election likely to be followed by a further election, such as a runoff.26 Thus, representation itself, as well as ac- countability, suggests that the two-party system should be maintained.27 24. Cf. F. SORAUF, POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM I02 (I964). 25. Note that there are potential paradoxes hidden in many voting systems. See, e.g., K. ARRow, SOCIAL CHOICE AND INDIVIDUAL VALUES 3 (2d ed. I963). For example, situations can be set up in which the preferences of individual voters are such that a majority will prefer A over B, another ma- jority B over C, and a third majority C over A-even though no one voter would do so. 26. See V. 0. KEY, JR., supra note I7, at 4I9-20. 27. The same conclusion, favoring the two-party system, has been reached in a number of recent analyses. See S.

Although Professor Bickel and this Article reach a number of similar conclusions, they do so for rather different reasons. Professor Bickel argues that the preference given to big states and urban interests by the electoral college system is a desirable counterbalance to the preference given to small states and rural interests in Congress by a number of factors that he sensitively outlines. He would in addition make the presidential nomi- nating process more democratic and responsive. While agreeing with his second point, I would hope</page><page sequence="8">I72 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 22: Page i65 Moreover, it is very likely that new positions will ultimately be more effec- tively represented through the major parties rather than through third parties.28 II. Williams v. Rhodes In Williams v. Rhodes29 the Supreme Court was presented with a spe- cific issue arising out of this morass: Should Ohio be forced to admit the Ohio American Independent Party's nominee, George Wallace, to its gen- eral-election ballot? Ohio law required that a new party, in order to gain access to the general ballot, obtain petitions signed by qualified electors totaling I5 percent of the number of ballots cast in the last preceding guber- natorial election and file such petitions by February I5.30 Mr. Wallace's party had obtained the required number of signatures, but not by the estab- lished deadline. The stage was thus set for a confrontation in which the state's basic requirement (I5 percent of the electorate) was met, but not its technical requirement.3" Justice Black delivered the Court's opinion, which was prepared in a single week.32 He summarily disposed of the political-question doctrine on grounds of Baker v. Carr33 and McPherson v. Blacker."4 He similarly dis- posed of article II issues-which would appear to give the states certain special power over presidential elections-on the grounds that these powers that analogous reforms in the legislative election process would be one step in modifying the balance of power in Congress itself. 28. Compare the small number of third parties that have actually been on ballots with the relative ease of access to ballots in many states. In 42 states, one percent or less of the vote suffices for access. See 393 U.S. at 33 n.g. But see Lipset, Party Systems and the Representation of Social Groups, in Po- LITICAL PARTIES 40, 5I (R. Macridis ed. I967): "[A]n examination of comparative politics suggests . . . that electoral laws determine the nature of the party-system as much as any other structural variable."

In facing election issues (as opposed to election districting issues) the Court will almost always be faced with such short deadlines, for the issues will generally be raised only in the heat of a campaign. In one recent case, however, the Court developed what may be a new definition of "case or controversy" to confront this problem. An independent party, seeking a place on the Illinois ballot, was denied relief on a "Motion to Advance and Expedite the Hearing and Disposition of this Cause" because of Illinois' physical inability to modify the ballot. In spite of normal mootness doctrines, review was granted after the election because the problem was one "capable of repetition, yet evading review." Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 8i6 (I969). The scope of this Moore v. Ogilvie exception to the mootness doctrine was substantially narrowed in two decisions of the I969 term: Brockington v. Rhodes, 396 U.S. 4I (I969) (per curiam) (appeal from decision denying mandamus to independent candidate seeking to attack petition requirements rejected for mootness; not a class action, no allega- tion of intent to run again); Hall v.

It is not at all clear that such stan- dards exist in the political-spectrum representation area, at least as approached in Williams. 34. 146 U.S. I (I892).</page><page sequence="9">January I970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES 173 "may not be exercised in a way that violates other specific provisions of the Constitution."35 Then, using the first amendment to support an equal protection argu. ment, he moved to the substantive issues. It is at this point that Justice Black's argument becomes somewhat unclear. He does not rely at all on the fact that it was only a technical timino requirement that had not been met -his attack is much broader. Justice Black appears to argue that the force of the equal protection clause depends on the character of what is made unequal: In determining whether or not a state law violates the Equal Protection Clause, we must consider the facts and circumstances behind the law, the interests which the State claims to be protecting, and the interests of those who are disadvantaged by the classification. In the present situation the state laws place burdens on two dif- ferent, although overlapping, kinds of rights-the right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, and the right of qualified voters, regardless of their political persuasion, to cast their votes effectively. Both of these rights, of course, rank among our most precious freedoms.36 In evaluating the state's compelling interest, Justice Black specifically rejects certain defenses of the two-party system discussed in the preceding section. The state's interest in the political stability resulting from a two- party system is rejected because the system "does not merely favor a 'two- party system'; it favors two particular parties ."37 The vote-splitting argument is rejected because, if completely followed, it would keep "parties off the ballot until they have enough members to win" and "would stifle the growth of all new parties."" He goes on to reject the argument that the issues raised by the third party could be raised in primaries, but-and this is significant-he does so on the grounds that that would not occur in fact: But while this goal may be desirable, Ohio's system cannot achieve it. Since the principal policies of the major parties change to some extent from year to year, and since the identity of the likely major party nominees may not be known until shortly before the election, this disaffected "group" will rarely if ever be a cohesive or identifiable group until a few months before the election.39 The Court does not lay down an absolute right of minority-party access to the ballot; it rejects the bid of the Socialist Labor Party, although perhaps on equitable rather than constitutional grounds.40 Justice Black's approach suggests that he is not treating ballot access as a pure first amendment case. Otherwise, he could hardly have allowed the Socialist Labor Party to be 35. 393 U.S. at 29. 36. Id. at 30. 37. Id. at 32. 38. Id. at 33. 39. Id. 40.

Instead, he must be using the first amendment only to justify a special equal protection standard. Justice Douglas's concurring opinion4" appears very much to follow the path of the Court's opinion, except that he may be finding an independent first amendment right to qualify as a third party, for he emphasizes the oh. stacles lying in the way of a potential third party. The first amendment concept is presented quite explicitly in Justice Harlan's concurring opinion.42 He rejects the one-man-one-vote principle in the context of presidential elections and also the majority's equal protec- tion arguments. Instead he employs the due process clause, arguing that "[j] ust as a political group has a right to organize effectively . . . so it has the right to place its candidates for the Presidency before whatever body has the power to make the State's selection of Electors."43 The immediate force of this logic goes only to presidential elections; however, it could readily be extended to cover other elections. Chief Justice Warren and Justices Stewart and White dissent." The issues are not yet well considered, they argue; the states have valid interests of the kinds discussed earlier in this Article and section one of article II gives the states special power in the area. III. Williams AS A BASIS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT Williams puts the Court into the business of judging ballot-access issues, and no justiciability or jurisdictional barriers are likely to be raised in the future. Moreover, Williams indicates, in a strong opinion, that third parties will be given some form of judicial protection. It is clear that the Court's action will restructure the political system at least as radically as the appor- tionment decisions. However, the form of the new structure is still unclear. The analysis of Part I suggested that the character of party organization would be the more fruitful and appropriate direction for judicial interven- tion. As will be seen, Williams raises some problems here through its first amendment doctrine, but it also creates enormous possibilities through its equal protection doctrine.45 41. 393 U.S. at 35. 42.

First Amendment Issues First amendment issues, as approached through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, have always been lurking just below the sur- face in the election area." So far as is known, however, Williams is the first time a first amendment argument has prevailed in a Supreme Court elec- tion-procedure decision-and even so, it is not at all clear that the first amendment occupied more than an ancillary role in Justice Black's ma- jority opinion. A first amendment attack on ballot-access restrictions begins by assum- ing that running a candidate amounts to a form of expression deserving protection, or is at least essential to the realization of a course of protected expression.47 For small groups representing a relatively unusual view- such as pacifists or prohibitionists-formation of a political party is indeed a means of expression, one that is especially adapted to demonstrating the extent of public support for their view. Access to the general ballot would not appear to be essential to that function, which is more educational and argumentative than oriented toward electoral victory. Access to some ballot, however, would be constitutionally required for such groups, at least after Williams. In these groups the party leadership takes the initiative, and restrictions requiring their neutrality would severely limit the effective ex- pression of their ideas. For the major parties, however, the expression ele- ment is much less important. Major parties do have an educational function that involves expression, but basically they are in the business of getting candidates elected. Their educational function is subordinate to this end. Hence they are in a real sense a conduit between the people and the govern- ment, and party-democracy restrictions are much more appropriate. The success of such a first amendment attack on ballot-access restrictions will depend upon the boundaries of the Williams doctrine. While these boundaries are unclear-largely because the two examples before the Court in Williams were relatively easy-they can perhaps be inferred from the cases that the Court cites. The first amendment cases relied on most heavily are NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson48 and NAACP v.

Alabama is a very strong freedom of association case in which the Court protected the NAACP against an Alabama effort to obtain its membership lists. Justice Harlan based the result upon the "likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioner's members of their right to freedom of association,"'" and the absence of a "controlling justifi- cation"52 for the State's action. There was a showing in the record that vari- ous forms of reprisal and coercion might occur to those whose affiliation was disclosed. This result is unexceptionable; its application to political- spectrum representation is doubtful. The NAACP was concerned about survival; the minority group seeking a general-ballot position is concerned only about a very specific aspect of its activity. Button is cited both for its indication that freedom of association is a first amendment right and for its standard: "[O]nly a compelling state in- terest in the regulation of a subject within the State's constitutional power to regulate can justify limiting First Amendment freedoms."53 This case is one of the broadest extensions of first amendment protection to mixed speech and conduct; the NAACP's litigating activities were held protected against an attack made under Virginia legal-ethics legislation. Justice Bren- nan, writing for a five-man majority, defined the litigating activities as expression because they constituted "vigorous advocacy, certainly of law- ful ends."54 He went on to add that litigation might be the only means avail- able to a minority when access to the ballot is closed. Although the result is appealing, the notion that litigation constitutes first amendment expression certainly appears novel, especially when applied with the severe standard quoted above. Justices Douglas and White, in separate concurrences, imply that the Court's result might have been better reached on grounds that the statute was drafted and applied so as to, discriminate against the NAACP. Finally, in United Mine Workers, District I2 V. Illinois State Bar Asso- ciation,55 a labor union's use of an attorney to assist its members in bringing claims was attacked on the basis of legal-ethics laws. The test was weighted against the state: It would not be enough if "the laws do in fact provide a helpful means of dealing with" an evil within the state's competence. The result follows directly from Button, but it is subject to the same objections. The Court has been tending under the speech part of the first amend- ment to afford less extensive constitutional protection in mixed expression and action cases. This can be seen in the picketing cases and demonstration cases, in which the Court is decreasing the absolute character of the first amendment by applying a standard that allows more state regulation as the 51. 357 U.S. at 462. 52.

Florida,57 United States v. O'Brien,58 and Street v. New York59 reveal a judicial schizophrenia.60 It is hard to argue rationally that burning a draft card is any less expression than is bringing a suit, or that demonstrating on a jail ground is any less assembly for petition than is or- ganizing the NAACP. Part of the difficulty lies in the characterization of an activity. If activity is characterized as mixed expression and action, the balancing tests are likely to apply under the speech part of the first amend- ment. If activity is characterized as association or petition for redress of grievances, a more nearly absolute balance, more heavily weighted against the state, may be applied under the petition part of the amendment-be- cause the activity looks less mixed when held up against that label. What is important in Williams, however, is that the Court has relied upon the stricter line (NAACP v. Alabama and Button) in dealing with political parties. Under this interpretation it will be somewhat more diffi- cult for the Court to sustain any regulation of political parties, even the 56. Consider, for example, the Court's decisions on picketing: Teamsters Local 695 v. Vogt, Inc., 354 U.S. 284 (I957) (state restrictions aimed at implementation of state policy held constitutional); Thornhill v. Alabama, 3I0 U.S. 88 (I940) (state restrictions held unconstitutional where there was no clear and present danger of substantive evils). On civil rights demonstrations: Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. I3I (I966) (first amendment guarantee of free speech held to extend to appropriate types of action, including the right to silent protest); Cox v. Louisiana, I &amp; II, 379 U.S. 536, 379 U.S. 559 (I965) (state regulation of otherwise protected activity held constitutional where the regulation is narrow in scope, appropriately designed to protect an important state interest, and nondiscriminatory in operation). These cases also indicate the different tests that the Court has from time to time applied in the area of freedom of speech, and give some indication of the range of flexibility with which the tests have been applied. In particular, an examination of these cases tends to support the proposition that where mixed speech and conduct are involved, the stringency of the first amendment standard will vary, depending on the relative importance of the conduct element and the expression element. 57. 385 U.S. 39 (I966). 58. 391 U.S. 367. 59. 394 U.S. 576 (I969). 6o.

Id. at 48. Justice Douglas dissented, joined by Chief Justice Warren and Justices Brennan and Fortas. Id. He suggested application of a balancing test under which the rights to petition and peaceable assembly to obtain action from the government must be weighed against factors favoring state intervention, here interference with the rights of other users of the public property involved. A similar argument was found in the recent draft-card case, United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (I968), in which the defendant was convicted of burning his draft card. He argued that in burn- ing his draft card he was engaging in symbolic expression that was a form of speech protected by the first amendment. The Court rejected this argument, stating that not every form of mixed conduct and expression is protected by the first amendment. It stated that the interest of the nation in maintaining a workable Selective Service System must be balanced against the interest of the individual in express- ing his protest. In O'Brien the protest contained large elements of conduct and relatively minimal ele- ments of expression. Consequently, the Court found the balance of interests to favor the Government. In Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576 (I969), the Court did not even seriously consider the expression element associated with a flag-burning conviction. Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court argued that it had not been shown that the defendant had not been convicted because of what he said while he burned the flag, and reversed. The dissenting Justices (Black, White, Warren, and Fortas) found this an evasion of the flag-burning question and implied that they would all find flag-burning to be subject to state regulation.</page><page sequence="14">178 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 22: Page I65 "benign" kinds, discussed in Part IV-B, which it has always struggled to sustain. Moreover, the Court based Williams on cases that emphasize a group concept: The political group is protected, not the individuals who make up the group. This necessitates defining the groups that deserve protection as groups. Consider the Court's problem when confronted by groups that bolt the party after losing in a primary or a convention, such as the 1948 Dixie- crats. These groups had a chance at expression; yet, when one considers only the first amendment they appear to have as strong a case for ballot ac- cess as a group ignored by all major parties. Recognizing such groups, how- ever, would significantly weaken the major parties. A similar problem is created by a racially discriminatory party. There is presumably no consti- tutional reason why a racially restrictive group cannot retain its first amendment right to petition the government. Yet, the Court has applied the civil rights acts to hold that a political party cannot be racially restrictive.61 Finally, in light of the discussion of Part II, reading access to the general ballot as a first amendment right is inappropriate. United Mine Workers and NAACP v. Alabama involved situations in which the activity of those protected did not clash strongly with the rights of others. In the representa- tion area, the representation interests of one group must be weighed against corresponding interests of other groups, and absolute rights could be self- defeating. There are many effective ways, perhaps including primary-ballot access, by which the political rights of minority groups can be expressed; further, a voter can be a prisoner as much of his party as of his general bal- lot. Thus, it would appear unwise for the Court to follow Williams with a first amendment right to general-ballot access for groups generally. The Court might, however, use first amendment theory to ensure that minority positions obtain access to some ballot-either primary or general. It might also go on to require general-ballot access for third parties of some fairly large size. But it should avoid doctrine that limits the possibility of party regulation or that allows parties to be bypassed entirely. The constitu- tional background and the muted role of the first amendment in the ma- jority opinion suggest that such restraint will be exercised. This is fair; in political-spectrum representation problems the focus must be on the way different positions interact in producing general-ballot nominees, a result more likely to be achieved by equal protection treatment than by first amendment treatment. B. Equal Protection Issues Reynolds v. Sims62 opened a new era of constitutional political theory by applying the equal protection clause, one of the most revolutionary clauses 6i. United States v. Classic, 3I3 U.S. 299 (I94I). 62. 377 U.S. 533 (I964).</page><page sequence="15">January 1970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES I79 in the Constitution,83 to the voting area with sweeping effect. Without sig- nificant explanation, the decision announced that "an individual's right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the State.""4 Such a holding is pregnant with implications for equality of political-spectrum representation, but these implications are only now being realized. The Sims decision caps a sequence of recent cases, beginning with Baker v. Carr,65 in which the justiciability of the apportionment issue was estab- lished. Baker was followed by Gray v. Sanders,"8 in which a vote-counting imbalance, as opposed to a districting imbalance, was struck down. Prior to Gray, votes for statewide offices in Georgia had been weighted by various factors, differing from county to county. Gray was followed by Wesberry v. Sanders,67 in which equal districting in congressional elections was held required under article I, section 2 of the Constitution. Much has been written about the general impact of Sims, and mathema- ticians have had a field day in developing tests for substantial vote equal- ity.68 Little has been done, however, to evaluate the scope of the new equal protection doctrine in other areas of vote equality; vote equality measured across the political spectrum of voters has been particularly ignored."9 The Court moved hesitantly indeed prior to Williams. An issue similar to political-spectrum representation was once presented to the Court, but before the development of apportionment law. In Mac- Dougall v. Green70 a minority party objected to Illinois' refusal to allow ballot access because the party had not met numerical petition requirements for various parts of the state. The logic of MacDougall in sustaining the state law-that the state has "the power to assure a proper diffusion of po- litical initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses"71-was undercut by Sims, and the case was explicitly overruled in Ig6g,72 relying upon Sims and Baker v. Carr. Since MacDougall, the Court has considered some districting issues that have also presented political-representation questions. The first group of cases involves gerrymandering. In these cases election districts were shaped 63. For an elaboration of the revolutionary aspects of the equal protection clause see A. BERLE, THE THREE FACES OF POWER (I967). 64. 377 U.S. at 568 (Warren, C.J.). 65. 369 U.S. i86 (I962). 66. 372 U.S. 368 (I963) (striking down the Georiga county-unit system). 67. 376 U.S. I (I964). 68.

This problem was raised most substantially in Neal, Baker v. Carr: Politics in Search of Law, I962 SUPREME COURT REV. 252, 275-86 (I962).

The opposition might be relegated to one oddly shaped district that it carried by an over- whelming majority. The fifteenth amendment was used in Gomillion v. Lightfoot73 to strike down a I957 Alabama statute that had gerrymandered the town of Tuskegee in order to disenfranchise Negroes. A similar result would certainly appear to follow under the equal protection clause; the Court has stated as much in dictum, but there has been no square holding. For example, in Wright v. Rockefeller74 such an application of the equal protection clause was considered, but then rejected for failure to establish the necessary factual grounds. Multimember districts raise similar problems. Although the ratio be- tween representatives and voters in these heavily populated districts may be consistent with the rest of the state, several representatives are elected. The danger is that one preelection compromise will be made for the entire district, and groups that might have made themselves felt in a smaller dis- trict will be ignored.75 Such a district in Georgia was sustained in Fortson v. Dorsey,7" because no actual discrimination against a particular group had been shown.77 Justice Douglas, dissenting, said that it was unfair for some voters to be in multimember districts while others were in single- member districts.78 Nevertheless, in Dusch v. Davis79 Justice Douglas wrote a decision sustaining a municipal election system in which votes were to be given equal weight but in which the candidates had to reside in particular districts of unequal populations. In each of these cases the Court was faced with a districting problem that also carried implicit political-spectrum representation issues. In each of those since Sims, the Court's consideration of the latter issues was over- powered by the force of Sims. This is perhaps to be expected when a dis- tricting issue and a political-spectrum issue meet head on, as they did in Avery v. Midland County.80 There a local districting scheme was appor- tioned to provide heavy representation for a rural minority. But Avery in- volved a districting issue; Sims need not be so overpowering when the question revolves around the power of different voting groups to influ- 73. 364 U.S. 339 (I960). 74. 376 U.S. 52 (I964) (challenge of New York apportionment statute on fourteenth and fif- teenth amendment grounds). 75.

This issue requires different approaches. Hints toward defining the difference can be drawn from certain of last term's cases that raised questions of political-spectrum representation. Un- der the Voting Rights Act of i965,81 certain changes in voter qualifications cannot be put into effect without a judicial finding that they do not in- fringe the right to vote on account of race. In companion cases to Allen v. State Board of Elections,82 several Mississippi statutes raising political- spectrum representation issues were before the Court on review of a lower- court finding that the statutes did not require judicial review under the Voting Rights Act. One case83 involved a change from district to at-large voting for county supervisors. Citing Sims for the proposition that the right to vote can be affected by dilution as well as by prohibition, the Court con- cluded that this change could affect minorities: "Voters who are members of a racial minority might well be in the majority in one district, but in a decided minority in the county as a whole."84 Another statute tightened the provisions for access to the general ballot as an independent candidate, by providing, inter alia, that the petition must be filed before the primary and by denying any person who has voted in a party primary election ac- cess to the general ballot as an independent candidate.85 The Court simply noted that this meant loss of one's primary vote if he thought he might wish to become an independent candidate.86 Consequently, the Court held the Voting Rights Act applicable. These cases do not, of course, make con- stitutional law-presumably the standards of the Act are somewhat more severe than those of the Constitution. Nevertheless, they do show the Court's awareness of the possible effects of these restrictions in diminish- ing the extent to which a particular group is represented. Allen shows the Court responding to the high level of constitutional protection against racial discrimination. Two other cases decided last term suggest similar protection against discrimination on the basis of wealth. In both, the Court struck down statutes limiting the franchise for specific elections. A New York statute attempted to limit participation in certain school district elections to those who own or lease taxable real property and those who are parents (or have custody) of public-school children87 and a Louisiana statute gave only property-tax payers the right to vote in elections authorizing the issuance of bonds by a municipal utility.88 Although the 8i. 42 U.S.C. ?? 1973(a)-(p) (Supp. IV, i969). 82. 393 U.S. 544 (i969). 83.

Did the limitations "in fact sufficiently further a compelling state interest to justify denying the franchise to appellant and members of his class" ?89 What is interesting is that issues of discrimination against the poor were not even discussed; the discussion turned instead on the equivalence between the class of those actually concerned with the issue and the class of authorized voters, and the Court had no difficulty finding groups that were affected but not represented. Although these cases could be put together with Williams to make a rather persuasive legal argument that, when called on by a minority group, the Court should intervene in the mechanics of primaries and political par- ties, one is dissatisfied with the logic of such intervention and fearful of its consequences. In part, the difficulty is with the standard of the "compelling state interest." That standard focuses on a state choice designed to increase or decrease the representation of an identifiable group. This is clearly true of racial discrimination or of the franchise limitations presented in the previous paragraph. The difficulty is that the precise group disenfranchised in the political-spectrum representation case is not normally identifiable to the legislature at the time it passes the legislation structuring the election system. Similar reasons preclude the application of Sims geographic equality as a model. Geographic apportionment a la Sims attempts to allow each re- gion and ultimately each individual in the state the same chance of influ- encing legislative decisions. Equal apportionment is especially relevant wherever regionalism influences legislative decisionmaking, as in the allo- cation of state largesse. Apportionment across the political spectrum, how- ever, raises different issues. One legislator must represent a wide range of persons within his district, and his election necessarily involves some form of political compromise. Groups can be classified according to various cri- teria-such as income, race, or occupation. Representation by an elected official cannot provide each group with its proportional representation. Hence, it is technically impossible to balance this form of representation with the same precision as is possible for geographic representation. Fur- thermore, even if the results of the representation system can be measured less easily for the political-spectrum case, the fairness and effectiveness of a given election procedure is even harder to measure. One can confidently say that a particular apportionment scheme will or will not lead to sub- stantially equal geographic representation, although there may be minor problems such as whether it is population, registered voters, or people eli- gible to vote that should be made as equal as possible. However, it is much 89. 395 U.S. at 633. Accord, 395 U.S. at 704.</page><page sequence="19">January 1970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES I83 harder to estimate which of two relatively different primary schemes is more likely to lead to effective representation of the various elements of the political spectrum. Because of these uncertainties surrounding the construction of a politi- cal system, the posture of a reviewing court is entirely different than in districting cases. In developing laws governing political parties no one knows quite so clearly what the results will be as in districting. Moreover, a typical case will raise an issue in the context of an impending election whose outcome is unknown. Hence, a test oriented to immediate results is much less appropriate here. This is especially true since these cases in- volve important issues other than equality of representation: some sort of political stability, ability to form a working majority, and ability to de- velop and educate voters and politicians. The effective representation of a group (or at least the effect of a practice in denying representation to suc- cessive groups) has to be measured over several elections, even in a period of rapid social change. Williams can certainly be reasonably interpreted to meet these difficul- ties. It does raise another difficulty, however: In some of its language Wil- liams appears to imply that it is political positions or parties, not voters, that must be treated equally. To the extent that Williams carries this im- plication it violates the logic of Sims and Avery that voters, not positions, must be treated equally. Moreover, problems of defining a political party crop up again if equality is extended to parties rather than positions. IV. EQUALITY AMONG VOTERS A. Defining a Minimum Effective Right to Vote If the above analysis is correct, the most logically appropriate reading of Williams requires equal rights for voters holding different political po- sitions. It remains to be shown what content can be given to such a prin- ciple. Exactly what is it that should be equally shared? The answer to this question depends in part upon the goals to be achieved by representation. Those goals enforced by the Court should be minimum for a number of reasons. First, although there are outstanding exceptions, the state legislatures have on the whole handled the difficult issues of political-spectrum representation fairly well.90 Preelection-com- promise procedures require consideration of a number of interrelated fac- tors91 that may be better handled by a legislature than by a court. Preelec- tion-compromise regulation has traditionally been an area of state interest. go. Some exceptions may be found in the South, at least until recently. Further exceptions include some city political machines. 9 I. See note I 7 supra.</page><page sequence="20">I84 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 22: Page I65 It has so far been extraconstitutional, since the American political-party system evolved without any constitutional framework. Thus, one of the tests for any theory of judicial intervention in the nomination process should be whether the court's directive is generally consistent with state election systems and with past constitutional interpretations. Some mi- nority positions are bound to lose in each election and such a loss will appear legitimate to the losers and to the general public in many cases. It is only where this legitimacy is absent that judicial intervention is needed. Many possible policies might be considered in defining "representation" for judicial-intervention purposes: assurance that the spectrum of elected officials will correspond to the spectrum of viewpoints in the electorate; assurance that officials will respond to changes in the views of their con- stituencies; or, perhaps most important today, assurance that officials will respond more to the electorate than to lobbyists or campaign financiers. Any of these policies, however, are likely to provoke too great a judicial interference. It would be inconsistent with the American political system for courts to require proportional representation or to interfere with the activties of representatives once elected. A more basic policy would seem appropriate: representation viewed as a minimum right to throw the ras- cals out, a right that would inhere in the voters generally rather than in a particular challenger. This is really a corollary of the concept of account- ability that was mentioned in Part I as one of the distinguishing features of the two-party system as contrasted with proportional representation. Such a right is the narrowest definition of the control that the represented has over the representative. Moreover, it avoids the classical problem of whether an official should reflect the views of his constituency or exercise his own judgment although it may conflict with those views. The right to depose the official allows the people to make this choice. It is also a reason- able minimum reflection of political thought92 and of the approach to the Constitution contemporary at the inception of the United States.93 Finally, as will be seen, it meets the requirements of the previous paragraph that it be consistent with the general structure of the American political system.94 92.

Similarly, at the conclusion of a major empirical study, one group of researchers hypothesized</page><page sequence="21">January I970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES I85 The policy is not so minimal as to be meaningless. It does require that the election system present a reasonable chance for a strong challenger to emerge at any election in which a substantial proportion of the electorate is dissatisfied with the performance of the incumbent. This may in turn require that there be at least two parties or that there be a binding and reasonably open primary should there be only one major party. (More may be required should the hold of a machine in a de facto one-party situation be too tight.) Moreover, the primary should be one in which those dissatis- fied with the incumbent can join to choose a candidate representing their position. A system designed to fragment the opposition may be as bad as one designed to silence it. Should the nominee in a multiparty system not be chosen by primary, there would have to be some other procedure-for example, a representative convention-to ensure that the challenging can- didate reflects the views of a large portion of those dissatisfied with the incumbent. This policy or right can be reasonably used as a definition of what is to be equally shared in carrying out the equal protection doctrine developed in Williams. Thus, Williams should be read to require equality of the right to participlate in deposing existing representatives. Here is where the mini- mal definition is important. Equality of the right to be represented would probably imply proportional representation, but equality of a right to depose existing representatives implies only that each group in the district must have equal opportunity to enter into a coalition to depose existing representatives-that is, a fair share in choosing a challenging candidate. This reading of Williams and Sims is superior to a reinterpretation of the guaranty clause, for such a reinterpretation would lead almost inexor- ably to proportional representation just as Baker led to "one-man-one-vote." The proposed approach does not go quite so far. It could, however, also be reached, with the qualifications proposed here, from the line of substantive equal protection cases (which may include Williams). In these cases,95 the fact that a right with constitutional dimensions (such as voting or travel) is limited by a statute has been used to trigger application of an especially severe standard for equal protection. Thus, in Shapiro v. Thompson,96 state residence requirements for welfare were struck down because the state showed no "compelling interest"97 in those requirements that infringed the right to travel. The analogy to political-spectrum representation is clear. The standards for application of this proposed equality must leave much that voters are more influenced by a negative response to the party in power than by a positive response to the opposing party's program.

In some election systems, for example, a primary-winning candi- date may desire to gain support from among adherents of a political view- point that made a strong showing in the primary. Such representation should normally be adequate. Because of the difficulty of measuring the equality sought and because of the need for discretion in applying the standard, the ground for actionable discrimination in the area of political- spectrum representation should resemble the invidious-discrimination re- quirement traditionally associated with the equal protection clause rather than the one-man-one-vote measure used in Sims or the compelling-state- interest test of the substantive equal protection cases. A suggested version of the standard would be "systematic discrimination." This standard reaches the case of long-term discrimination that operates repeatedly to deprive a group of any reasonable opportunity to correct the discrimination.98 But it would also protect groups with short-lived yet in- tense views, such as the American Independent Party in Ohio, that were systematically denied access to the coalition-forming function within a given election, either through exclusion from the general ballot or through inability to exercise influence within a major party. Reliance solely upon a standard of "invidious discrimination" might have little effect upon po- litical-spectrum representation. For it is extremely seldom-perhaps only in the cases of racial discrimination or a very strongly entrenched machine- that an electoral system can be described with as anthropomorphic a term as "invidious." Prescience at the time the legislation is drafted as to the character of the groups that may be effectively disenfranchised is hardly needed to construct an election system that operates to disenfranchise one group continually or substantially retards the adjustment of the legislature to changes in public attitude. Either result would constitute adequate 98. It was suggested at the very beginning of this Article that the contemporary failures of legis- latures stem in part from their relative inflexibility. Legislators are biased toward their own mainte- nance in office and naturally favor legislative systems that ensure that the groups they represent will continue to be represented (by them), even at the cost of inadequate representation of other groups. In addition, the rapidity and frequency with which major political developments arise today have far outpaced the ability of the political system to respond. Whether this political response lag is only a temporary phenomenon preceding the restructuring of our political coalitions or a permanent feature resulting from the increasing rate of change in society itself, the result nevertheless is disenfranchise- ment of important groups of people. The prevalence of political inflexibility and unresponsiveness sug- gests that the standard of invidious discrimination should be read to include discrimination by neglect. There is a danger-for example, in states that have a strong two-party system in which transfer of registration from one party to another is very difficult-that the representation system will become inflexible and will fail to recognize the rise of new interests. This may have happened in the case of suburban populations, a group whose importance had gone unnoticed until after reapportionment. This type of group should be protected as well as those groups, such as Negroes or pacifists, who may be underrepresented by the intent of either the legislature or the political parties. Again, of course, the standard should be reasonably set to correspond to the realities of the preelection compromise. Not every group can expect to win every year in the negotiations that lead to the candidates on the general ballot. On the other hand, a substantial minority position should be represented by an occasional dde- gate in a legislature within a few legislative elections after the evolution of the position.</page><page sequence="23">January 1970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES I87 grounds for a judicial conclusion that the election system should be modi- fied toward more equal representation. Implementation of the minimum right focuses on the two most impor- tant factors of coalition formation: governance within the major parties and state election laws. Although equality of opportunity to unseat incum- bents has content beyond a simple right to unseat incumbents, any distinc- tion based on this difference must be deemphasized. Normally, someone- a financier or a boss-has an effective ability to unseat incumbents. So also should the party's rank and file.99 Thus, party democracy is demanded in some form. Parties, and specifically the two-party system, can certainly sur- vive the principle. Inclusion of all viewpoints on the general ballot-the alternative to the selection of a few candidates for the general election through intraparty democracy-can be nearly as self-defeating as inclusion of an arbitrary selection of one or two. It is certainly reasonable to leave party leaderships with enough strength to educate voters, to experiment with the formation of new coalitions, and to design those coalitions with some view toward effectiveness after the election.'00 Focusing on electoral procedures, the proposed equal protection doctrine would give constitu- tional status to the reforms of the Progressive era, but would go further: The coordinated shift of minor groups tends to form a coalition capable of unseating an incumbent. These shifts will occur only in the heat of an election campaign. Consequently, election procedures, such as filing dates, registration requirements, and the like, must not forestall this adjustment. B. First Amendment Issues The above analysis suggests that certain regulation of political parties may be required to facilitate the minimal substantive requirement devel- oped under the equal protection clause. The question arises whether such regulation is consistent with the first amendment. There is certainly no conflict on the issue of access of viewpoints to some ballot. Such access may be important in coalition formation. Rather, conflict arises on the question of access to the general ballot: The equal protection theory dictates that this should be limited; arguably, first amendment theory says the opposite. Conflict similarly arises on controls over the activity of the party organiza- tion in choosing among different possible nominees. However, laws of this character already exist. Designated party organizations and officials are 99. This point has been made in the presidential-nomination context: "In allowing the 'party' to exercise full control over nominatioln, a court is allowing a small number of individuals to substitute their judgment for that of the electorate, which, in effect, is a form of vote-dilution."

These restrictions have not been presented to the Court, but analogous provisions restricting the rights to persuade and to endorse, enacted for dif- ferent reasons, have been considered. In this series of cases the Court has carefully avoided the first amendment issue. Restrictions on labor-union activity in political campaigns have been twice presented to the Court- and twice evaded. In the first case the Court construed the relevant statute extremely narrowly to allow the activity in question, publication of a union newspaper.'03 In the second case, a government appeal of the dismissal of an indictment against a union for fraudulently sponsoring a television broad- cast during I954 congressional elections, the Court refused to anticipate the constitutional question, but remanded on statutory construction grounds.104 The Court has reached the constitutional aspects of the Hatch Act restric- tions on the political activities of civil servants and upheld them on the ground that the Government has a right to regulate public workers.'05 The Court has also avoided an attack upon political restrictions on public utili- ties by denying certiorari to a circuit-court approval of the restrictions.'06 Last term, mootness arguments were used to avoid the merits of an attack on a New York law prohibiting the distribution of anonymous campaign literature.'07 It can be inferred that the Court wanted to sustain these regulations, probably because they are not particularly useful for suppression of un- popular views and because the Court was in sympathy with their object. Nevertheless, aside from the special case of federal employment, the Court found no doctrine to sustain the regulations, but instead achieved the same result by indirection. This background argues against treatment of general-ballot access as a first amendment right with its implication that only de minimis restrictions can be placed on party activity. If such restrictions aid party democracy, the IOI. See, e.g., CAL. ELECTIONS CODE ? II,702 (West Supp. I968). I02. See, e.g., id. ?? 203, 3II (West I96I). I03. United States v.

Consider the most common restriction designed to promote party democracy: neutrality of party leadership during primaries. The goal of fair representation furthered by the restriction is of equal or greater consti- tutional magnitude than the goals sought by regulations that have been effectively sustained in the past: fairness of contributions to general elections and efficiency of the public service. The sweep of the restriction is much nar- rower; party officials are a numerically small group and are restricted only under limited circumstances. The regulation has little chilling effect on future speech and can hardly be accused of vagueness. Moreover, it is aimed at the specific and serious evil of political bossism. The major difficulty is that future restrictions may not be so clearly designed to control partisan politics. Instinctively, restrictions on partisan political speech are less dis- favored than restrictions upon the "marketplace-of-ideas" kind of speech that is the first amendment paradigm. This distinction does, however, relate to the distinction between major and minor parties. For major parties, which act as a conduit to power, candidate selection is far more than a means of expression. The converse is true for minor parties. Thus the development of a minimum right, phrased in terms of equal opportunity to throw the rascals out, cuts across many aspects of the Ameri- can political system. It is concerned with the internal governance of the major parties and the abilities of groups within those parties to voice vary- ing viewpoints. It is also concerned with the functioning of the election laws to the extent that they inhibit coalition formation within parties through such election procedures as filing dates, registration requirements, and other measures. The implications of the minimum right, both for the struc- ture of partes and the shape of electoral laws, are explored through the use of hypotheticals in the next section. V. FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF Williams The unconstitutionality of too great an encouragement of the two-party system has been established in Williams. If the approaches proposed in this Article were carried out, the long-run impact of the first amendment logic of the Williams concurring opinions would be minimized, while the im- pact of the Court's equal protection logic would be maximized-but not so much to provide equality between parties as to provide equality among voters. The Court's concern would be directed toward elimination of sys- tematic exclusion of any position from the formation of preelection coali- tions and toward assurance of each voter's right to throw the rascals out</page><page sequence="26">Igo STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 22: Page I65 through participation in a challenging coalition. The constitutional theory proposed in this Article can be tested and developed by application to a series of hypothetical examples. (A) A federal statute authorizes the granting of free television time during the general-election campaign in equal amounts to all congres- sional nominees of the two major parties'08 and to the nominees of any other parties that gained more than io percent of the vote in the district during the last presidential election. An excluded minor-party candi- date, citing Williams v. Rhodes, brings suit either for equal time or for denial of time to other candidates. This discrimination between large and small piarties will not operate substantially to perpetuate particular major-party positions against chal- lenge, provided that these positions can be challenged in the primary.109 If there is any doubt that the major-party primaries are in fact open, the burden of persuasion might properly be placed upon these parties, inasmuch as they are more likely to have accurate data. In presenting its decision, the Court could reaffirm the principle derived from Sims, that no minority positions may be systematically denied an ap- proximately equal chance to participate in an unseating coalition, while holding that this opportunity need not be supplied in the general election if it is supplied in the primary election. (From this statement, the desired burden of persuasion result flows readily.) Given that there had been suf- ficient opportunity for expression of the minority party's position, a mini- mum-rationality standard might be used to judge discrimination. Once the state has assured the essential opportunity for coalition formation, its regu- lation of minorities need not come under strict scrutiny. Here, the high costs of television would permit a degree of discrimination against minor parties that would be improper in other state services provided to candi- dates, such as publicly sponsored mailing of a defined amount of material by or about each candidate. In the latter example, such discrimination is far less rational. Assuming that counsel raised the contention that the four- teenth amendment required equality of treatment of political parties per se, the Court would have to reject this contention, applying the fourteenth amendment equality to voters rather than parties. Avery v. Midland County directly supports such a construction. The Court could distinguish Williams in many ways-for example, by differentiating presidential from legislative elections on the grounds that io8. Cf. Act of Aug. 24, I960, Pub. L. No. 86-677, 74 Stat. 554 (suspending 47 U.S.C. 315 (I964) for the period of the I960 presidential election). I09. Cf. Bickel, supra note 27, at 50.</page><page sequence="27">January 1970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES I9I maintenance of the two-party system is more important in the latter area and that the power of states to define representation procedures is greater in the latter area. Perhaps more persuasively, the Court could argue that in Williams, because of the presidential-convention problem, the Wallace movement was unable to participate in the electoral process except by means of a third party, whereas here the option of entering into a primary was available and effective enough to satisfy any first amendment require- ments."' Accordingly, the state has adequate grounds, consistent with the equal protection clause, for discriminating against a minority party in the conduct of the general election. (B) A state law prohibits the central organizations of the two major parties (defined explicitly) from endorsing candidates or otherwise seeking to influence the outcome of a primary. No similar restrictions are placed on minor parties, which can be easily formed in the state. A contested nomination arises in a minor party, and before the primary the insurgent candidate sues to enjoin the party organization from en- dorsing his opponent, arguing that the fourteenth amendment requires that the statute be applied to protect minority as well as majority candi- dates from bossism. This is the converse of the preceding example: Just as a state can legiti- mately discourage the growth of third parties (so long as it ensures that minority positions can be presented at some point in some manner), so can it impose restrictions on the major parties without imposing equivalent ones on the minor parties where the restrictions are neither constitutionally required nor politically appropriate. The Court could note the availability of ballot access through a new minor party and perhaps through a major party; thus, the opportunity for minority-group participation in the nomi- nation process is not decreased simply because one route is made more dif- ficult. The formal differentiation between minority elements of the major and of the minor parties does not discriminate in the actual opportunity for anyone to join in an unseating coalition; hence the difference in the power of party leadership is acceptable under the proposed equal protection stan- dard. As discussed in Part IV-B, an argument by an official of a major party that this law deprived him of first amendment rights would (but should not) give the Court some difficulty. (C) In a state in which third-party formation is possible but relatively difficult, the normal means of obtaining major-party voter rolls is IIO. This result leaves open the disconcerting possibility that a federal statute may be constitu- tional as applied in some states and unconstitutional as applied in others. Inasmuch as there is no in- vidious difference in the effectiveness of the electoral process solely because of the difference in subsidy, the differentiation between states is constitutionally unimportant.</page><page sequence="28">192 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol.22: Page i65 through the regular party organization, which maintains copies; alter- native means are either prohibitively inconvenient or prohibitively ex- pensive. The regular party organization makes these rolls available to its preferred primary candidate, but refuses to make them available to a party insurgent. He sues to obtain access. This is a paradigm case of the need for a party-democracy requirement that would be constitutionally imposed under the standards of this Article. The voters who might be represented by the insurgent are denied an equal opportunity to affect coalition formation, either by nominating a candidate or by showing sufficient strength that other nominees consider their posi- tion. The Court need not hesitate either at finding this discrimination in- vidious or systematic or at finding it to be state action for purposes of equal protection. (D) State law provides that the closing date for registration to vote in a party primary is February I, while the closing date to file in a party primary is March i. During the month of February it becomes apparent that there will be a close contest in the Democratic primary over an issue that is important to many voters of both parties. The Republican pri- mary is uncontested and the candidate takes a middle-of-the-road posi- tion on the issue. A Republican sues to be entitled to vote in the Demo- cratic primary claiming that he is otherwise unable to participate effec- tively in coalition formation as it affects this issue. Under the standard of this Article, the voter should win. Unless this sort of registration transfer is reasonably possible, there may be a substantial lag between the time that a new attitude or bloc appears in the citzenry and the time that it will be considered with appropriate weight by legislators. This is particularly the case with blocs that cross existing party lines (as new ones often will); the only way that such blocs can become effective is for them to have the opportunity to coalesce behind a candidate, who may be in the other party. This requires an ability to change parties after the issues in each party are somewhat clarified. Otherwise, the existing party patterns of bloc loyalty and appeal are substantially frozen, and a systematic discrimination against new positions results. Such discrimination could be found, under the modified Sims standard, to violate the fourteenth amend- ment. It does no good to respond that the transfers can occur before the closing date: As history has shown, substantial shifts to third parties occur only during the heat of a political campaign,"1' and the same can be ex- pected of important restructuring of the major parties. iiI. The obvious examples are Bull Moose (1912) and Dixiecrat (1948). For parties that exist outside of a separatist context, the point is perhaps that interest and incentive exist only during elec- tions.</page><page sequence="29">January I970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES I93 Though perhaps controversial because of the danger of primary pack- ing that is implied, this result appears inescapable, and has also been reached, albeit with similar misgivings, by Professor Bickel."2 The possible effects of the reform run relatively deep. Thus, to the extent that parties expect voters attracted to a primary to remain with the party in the general election, they may encourage controversy and interesting contests in the primary-a truly healthy result. If this development can occur, together with any sort of rationalization of financing, there is hope that the party could move ever closer to a machine for systematically sounding public opinion and recruiting candidates capable of forming new blocs."3 Be these glowing results as they may, the modified Sims principle does not require the right of cross-filing for candidates. Presentation of a posi- tion by one candidate capable of appealing to all voters is certainly consti- tutionally adequate, and its effect should be carefully distnguished from voter cross-filing. The most serious problem resulting from cross-filing is that one man, often an incumbent, will receive both major-party nomina- tions, depriving the voter of any effective choice. This problem need not result here, if a candidate may appear only on one ballot and write-in votes for him on other ballots are declared void. Even so there is a possibility that blocs will still split proportionately among the parties, leading to nomina- tion of similar candidates. However, considering the pull of party loyalty that would remain and the fact that most elections have a built-in asymetry between the parties with and without an incumbent, such splitting would appear no more likely than with the current system. Likewise, the principle of open registration need not be extended to allow, for example, participa- tion in the Democratic Senate primary and the Republican House primary. The possibility of effective disenfranchisement through denial of the op- portunity is small. Moreover, as between the executive and the legislative nominees of a party for one level of government, there is a reasonable state interest in ensuring that all coalitions (each represented by one party) have similar makeups. This is part of the two-party system of responsibility and ability to propose and enact a legislative program. (E) State law provides for a neutral party organization and for reason- ably open primaries. A cohesive group within the party, with only casual relationship (or even in opposition) to the official party, under- takes a program of primary candidate selection and endorsement, and of campaign finance and organization. The group is successful to the extent that, in many parts of the state, its candidates are guaranteed vic- 112. Bickel, supra note 27, at 48-49. 113. Thus, it might operate the tools of polling and computer analysis of returns and voting blocs, tools that are now normally under the control of individual candidates. Insofar as the principles of example C require the party to make them available to all primary candidates, the tools might lose some of their current antidemocratic aspects and serve instead to assist effective representation.</page><page sequence="30">194 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 22: Page i65 tory in the primary, and usually in the general election. A competing party group, claiming that it is effectively denied equivalent access to the general election ballot, seeks an injunction requiring that the suc- cessful group spread its endorsements and finance, or alternatively be prohibited from such activities. For several reasons, this situation is the most difficult of those posed thus far. First, the cohesive group could be anything from the Freedom Demo- cratic Party to a labor union or the Daley machine. Second, it is difficult to define relief for the competing group. Taken together with the fact that the proposed constitutional standard recognizes that opportunity cannot be present in every election and the fact that our party system does consist of a collection of more or less entrenched subparties meeting the description in the example, these difficulties suggest that the Court should not normally interfere in this kind of controversy. Although the Court could rely on the discretion of equity or on a political-abstention doctrine to avoid a substan- tive decision, the Court would better determine that the discrimination is not invidious. The Court's function is to ensure a substantial equality of po- litical opportunity, not to unseat machines, some of which provide a great responsiveness to the electorate within the framework of the machine. If an element of state law or a party practice can be shown by the complainants to interfere unduly with the ability to unseat an entrenched group, then a specific attack on the practice might be sustained. If the degree of entrench- ment is extreme, the actions of the entrenched group might be regarded as state action-and constitutional standards might be directly applied to it. The Court took this approach to racial discrimination in an organization that had no legal status but was organized precisely like a major party.114 The state action concept would also be especially appropriate with respect to activities that may be identified with the government as well as with the machine-for example, a machine custom that those in patronage jobs con- tribute a portion of their salary to the machine. (F) A primary candidate, who is seeking to appeal to the poor and who is poor himself, charges that the existing electoral system systematically discriminates against the poor. He seeks an injunction against primary spending by other candidates or, alternatively, federal or state financial assistance to his own campaign. He alleges that only the poor can repre- sent the poor and cites, in addition to Sims and Williams, Griffin v. llli- nois"' and the following passage: Money looms large in American politics and campaign spending is high and rising. Unlimited funding will not by itself assure victory in any major contest, 114. Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 46I (1953) (Jaybird preprimary). 115. 351 U.S. I2 (1956).</page><page sequence="31">January I970] REPRESENTATIVE NOMINEES I95 but lack of money is a severe handicap in gaining a hearing for candidates and issues. . . . Money is more likely to be decisive in primaries than in final elec- tion campaigns, especially for non-incumbents without "machine" endorse- ments.116 This is perhaps the most severe test of the Williams doctrine, whether or not developed as proposed in this Article-and the doctrine appears both utterly applicable and highly revolutionary. The Court is clearly unable to develop a solution itself, although it might require officials to enforce exist- ing campaign finance laws under pain of contempt or even require legis- latures and political parties to develop methods to deal with the problem. It would be better for these organizations to begin facing the problem now. Perhaps, when it comes to the Court, a defense could then be made that whether the representation is made by rich or poor candidates, the poor are being effectively represented. VI. CONCLUSION The examples suggest that the proposed interpretation of Williams in terms of an equal protection of the right of voters to throw the rascals out can both respect the genius of the American two-party system and provide a basis for reform of certain of its more egregious shortcomings. In particu- lar, it can do so far better than equal protection of the rights of parties or a first amendment right of ballot access, either of which, although equally derivable from Williams, might well lead to proportional representation or to chaos at the time of the general election. Moreover, the focus of the pro- posed interpretation meets the problems of retarded representation-the suggestion that certain registration limitations are unconstitutional may be the most important result of the proposed standard. One might even go further and argue that, given today's data-handling technology, states have a duty to make coalition assembly more flexible by redesigning election mechanics so that campaign needs and time for challenging certification requirements are the only factors considered in setting filing and registra- tion dates. Although these results may seem radical, they are not as radical as an attack on the two-party system either legally under alternative read- ings of Williams or politically in reaction to feelings of disenfranchisement.
