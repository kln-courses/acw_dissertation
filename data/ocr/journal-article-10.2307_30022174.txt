<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN OPERATIONAL MODEL FOR LANGUAGE BEHAVIOR John B. Carroll Harvard University My task in this symposium, as I take it, is to try to state-or at least to describe-the kind of psychological model which would be necessary and suf- ficient for dealing with the phenomena of language behavior. Under this lat- ter I understand all such things as the child's learning of his native language, the individual's learning of a second language (at any age), the individual's use of language in his day to day activities, and so forth, even including those special and modern kinds of language behavior which are demanded of an in- dividual when he is a subject in certain psychological experiments. One would like the model also to deal with such special problems as linguistic relativity, language change, and universal grammar, but perhaps this is ask- ing too much. I shy away from any promise to state a complete model be- cause it certainly could not be done in the limited scope of this presentation; in any case, a complete model might be nothing less than the whole science of psychology. The scope of a model depends upon the level of discourse or reference chosen. Some psychologists, such as Bush and Mosteller,' have been laboring mightily to develop a valid mathematical and logical model for the fine-grain structure of some of the most elementary phenomena of be- havior such as the learning of discriminations. At the opposite extreme, B. F. Skinner has taken such phenomena as perception, discrimination, and reinforcement for granted, and with their aid has built a model which pur- ports to account for a very large proportion of human behavior insofar as it comes within the ken of the behavioral psychologist qua psychologist2 --in- cluding, of course, what Skinner calls verbal behavior.3 It will probably help matters at this point to say that I find myself in agreement with large parts of Skinner's analysis of behavior, including much (though not all) of his model of verbal behavior, and that I am interested inmodel-building at this level of scope rather than at the more molecular level with which Estes, Mosteller, and others are concerned. Some such model should be tested in its applica- tion to various enterprises in both linguistics and the psychology of language, e. g., Chomsky's theory of grammar,4 Osgood's work with the 'semantic dif- ferential',5 Jenkins's work with association phenomena,6 and my own work with individual differences in verbal performance7 and the effect of language structure on cognition.8 Models may be represented in a variety of presumably equivalent ways: for example, they may be presented as networks of interrelated propositions,9 or they may be presented as hypothetical physical systems.'0 During the past year, in connection with another one of my interests I have become rather intimately familiar with the logic of high-speed electronic computing machines, 37</page><page sequence="2">38 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 1, No. 1 and it has occurred to me, as no doubt to others, that computer logic may be a convenient and in fact peculiarly appropriate means of representing a model for verbal behavior. Computer logic has the added feature that it immediately implies the possibility of generating and thus stimulating the class of phenomena with which it is concerned. The simulation of certain aspects of language behavior by computing machine appears entirely feasible to me; I am inclined to differ with Lees, who says in his review of Chomsky's Syntactic Structures:" "It already seems quite likely that no finite automa- ton, such as an electric computer, will be adequate to generate the nested and recursive properties of natural language." If the question of the ade- quacy of a computer turns on its finiteness, it must be adequate, because a language system is essentially finite (a speaker possesses a finite number of nerve cells, and a language possesses a finite number of speakers); and if it turns on the difficulty of dealing with 'nested and recursive properties', the solution is simply to build into the machine the required processes; ac- tually nesting and recursion are commonplace capabilities of typical general- purpose computers available today. It should be noted, however, that I propose to use computer logic solely as a means of representing a model of language behavior; the question of the validity of such a model is a difficult one. Unfortunately, simulation of a class of events by computer does not have a unique solution: identically the same result may be attained by following instructions in any one of several different orders, or even by following different kinds of instructions. Never- theless, simulation by computer can help to narrow down the range of pos- sible solutions, and it would readily enable one to generate large quantities of material which could be evaluated for verisimilitude. Further, the de- mands of programming for simulation by computer would force explicitness in assumptions. For the purpose of this exposition, let us assume that the individual verbally-behaving organism is represented by a single machine, and that to simulate interaction between individuals we would use several interconnected or mutually confronted machines, one for each individual.'2 We take it for granted that each machine has the possibility of input and output, a central control through which all instructions and processes flow, a large random access storage into which instructions and data of all sorts can be put and which can be modified, a temporary storage or 'work-space', and finally a power supply. What the exact analogues of these features may be in the human organization is largely irrelevant for the present purpose; obviously, input and output are analogous to sensorium and response mecha- nism, respectively, while central control and storage are analogous to the central nervous system. As said before, the model needed to deal with language behavior is noth- ing less than a model for all the behavior of the organism. How can the enormity of this model be conceptualized in manageable terms ?</page><page sequence="3">Operational Model for Language Behavior 39 Here let us appeal to the notions of main routine and subroutine as used in computer logic. A routine may be defined as any distinct sequence of in- structions with at least a specified. starting point. Routines are either 'main routines' or 'subroutines.' The main routine contains the start and (usually) the finish of any overall 'program'; it may contain detailed instructions of its own, but in all but the simplest programs it will contain a series of 'calls' to subroutines. A subroutine, which may in turn contain calls to other sub- routines, is a set of instructions which may be used repetitively, on 'call' within either the main routine or other subroutines. The status of subroutines in our model of language behavior will vary. Some routines are fundamental--built into the initial structure of the program, so to speak; others will be developed by the program itself in the course of its operation. In fact, one of the former class of routines will be a routine for developing new routines, storing them in memory, and later modifying them. Such routines, in computer language, are 'assembly' or 'compiling' routines. Some routines will be concerned chiefly with input of information, others with output, still others with the 'processing' of information for storage or for eventual output. Further, some routines will be of highly general scope- frequently called; others will rarely be called. Some routines may be com- plex, with many calls to other subroutines; others may be simple, with few instructions or few calls to other routines. The feature by which routines may call each other will most effectively serve to represent the hierarchical structure of behavior which is so evident in the use of language. Any computer must have a certain 'language' in which its instructions are formulated. Since lack of space forbids presenting an instruction lan- guage in detail, we will simply describe routines in general terms, assuming that an appropriate instruction language is available for formulating them. (As a matter of fact, the exact nature of these routines is precisely the sub- ject matter of various branches of psychology and of linguistics.) To enable us to depict the sequencing, looping, and nesting of subroutines, however, we need two specific instructions: CALL (name of routine) RETURN (to point from which the routine was called) There will furthermore be a 'dummy' instruction STIMULUS which will repre- sent the possibility of breaking into the operation of the organism with an in- put which may or may not have been programmed for (in anthropomorphic language we may say that the stimulus is either 'anticipated' or 'unantici- pated'). It is obviously impossible and indeed uninteresting to design a model for simulating the whole of behavior all at once. Both in practice, and for pur- poses of exposition here, it is convenient to specify programs for separate aspects of behavior; these then would constitute subroutines to be assembled in some hypothetical main program . Four classes of programs may be of</page><page sequence="4">40 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 1, No, 1 interest: (1) programs concerned with the original learning of language in the child-programs for what Roger Brown13 has called The Original Word Game; (2) programs concerned with the learning of a second language- (3) programs illustrating learned verbal behavior performance in a two- or multi-person communication situation, including the composition of utter. ances in a specified language by the several parties to the situation and the mutual comprehension of these utterances; (4) programs illustrating special tasks demanded of individuals in certain psychological tests and experiments. We will present and discuss, at least in skeletal form, programs illustrat- ing each of these classes except (2), Display 1 presents various elements of a program for the original learn- ing of the mother tongue by the child. It contains some of the basic and most essential routines of the model- routines that are used recursively and form the material of other programs. In major outlines, B. F. Skinner's analysis14 is followed, particularly his very useful and insightful distinction between what he calls the mand and the tact. Roughly speaking, a mand is any re- sponse which has been conditioned to come under the control of some spe- cific deprivation state in such a way that when emitted it tends to elicit from an outside source (e. g., another person) the specific gratification for that deprivation. For example, the cry Water I of a thirsty man is supposed to be a mand since it tends to get him water through the mediation of some other person who hears it. A tact, on the other hand, is a response which has been conditioned to come under the control of a specific external stimu- lus by virtue of having received some sort of generalized reinforcement. For example, a child who upon being stimulated in some way by water utters a sound something like the morpheme water is making a response which will tend to become a tact if somebody happens to reward the child, by a smile or some gratifying act, for making a response considered to be appropriate to the stimulus. In the case of both the mand and the tact, the contingencies (i.e., the particular conditions under which a response is reinforced) are arranged by an external source, and to the extent that the contingencies are made uniform and tied in with a system of similar and coordinate responses, there can be said to exist a language. It is mutually rewarding, in a strict behavioral sense, for the speakers of a language to preserve the contin- gencies of reinforcement in a relatively stable manner. And they do. For the psychologist, this observation is nearly everything that is necessary to explain the fact of language. The only other basis of explanation needed is a set of principles accounting for the fact that speakers possess the discrim- inative and retentive capabilities necessary to preserve the contingencies of reinforcement. The programs are prefaced with a statement of the conditions of storage which would have to be assumed in order for the programs to operate. The program for the mand is placed to the left because it is presumably prior</page><page sequence="5">Operational Model for Language Behavior 41 and more basic than the program for the tact. Since the tact depends for its establishment upon the chance and repeated occurrence of a response that will be sufficiently acceptable to the reinforcing agent, tacts will tendto be established relatively later than the corresponding mands, even when they are of the same form. It is interesting to speculate how far the programs for the acquisition of mands and tacts will account for all verbal behavior. There is little doubt that routines for the establishment of mands and tacts function in an analogous way in the human organism. Nevertheless, their soundest experimental ba- sis lies in Skinner's work with rats and pigeons, which press bars or peck at targets, but which never 'communicate' with anyone except possibly the ex- perimenter, but he does not himself use bar-pressing or pecking as modes of communication. If the routines for the acquisition of mands and tacts were the only ones available, it would be difficult but probably still possible in principle to teach a child to talk without ever talking to him. Something of this sort is accomplished when a deaf child is taught to speak. In the normal child, the establishment of tacts and probably also mands is facilitated by the development of echoic (imitative) behavior. One could make a case for re- garding the echoic response as Coordinate and of equal status with the mand and the tact; Dollard and Miller'5 postulate that imitation is a special learned activity of the child and have presented a learning-theory paradigm for its acquisition. Learning to imitate may be accounted for by an application of the program for the acquisition of a tact; in this application, the response which is actually reinforced (again, notice, by an external source which is alert to reward such occurrences) is any response which happens to be simi- lar to a heard (or seen) stimulus. From the standpoint of programming such behavior, it appears to be necessary to postulate some internal process by which the machine perceives that it is the class of 'similar responses' which is rewarded rather than any particular response as such. Thus, even in programming the analogue of such an apparently elementary kind of response as the echoic response, it is necessary to introduce a routine (the routine 'SIMILAR') which will correspond to what psychologists call the mediation process.'6 The program for the acquisition of the GENERIC ECHOIC RE- SPONSE (Display 2) is intimately related to that for the acquisition of tacts as such, because the motor responses which ultimately become tacts are most often acquired initially as generic echoic responses. The program for the acquisition of a tact will serve to represent a very broad range of phenomena we observe in language behavior-all those cases in which some linguistic form or sequence of forms is 'brought under the control of' a particular stimulus class. The classes may be very narrow- e. g., limited to the appearance of a particular unique stimulus, as in the case of the learning of certain proper nouns--or very broad, as in the case of generic and abstract terms, names of events and relationships, etc. All that</page><page sequence="6">42 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol.. 1, No. 1 needs to happen is to have the experimenter or external source arrange mat- ters so that the response is made only with respect to a certain combination of criterial attributes in stimuli, arrangements of stimuli, and sequences of stimuli, and this set of criterial attributes may be successively modified so that the child 'forms a concept,' as we say; for example, the child learns the concept of milk by learning what criterial attributes distinguish it from other liquids. Skinner takes pains to insist that a mand is not the same as a tact, even when it is of the same phonetic shape. Water! learned as a mand, he thinks, does not automatically transfer to water learned as a tact. This may well be true of the first few dozen words the child learns, but it is not necessarily true of the subsequent development. The distinction between mand and tact can be seen to be preserved throughout the whole life history, but the status of 'manding' and 'tacting' undergoes great alteration. Our model needs a mechanism whereby 'manding' and 'tacting' can be genericized, and whereby responses learned as parts of mands can be transferred for use in tacts, and vice versa. Mechanisms whereby this may happen are suggested in Dis- play 2. The basic notion underlying all the programs in Display 2 depends on regarding 'tacting' as a response which also fits into the mand mecha- nism, because such responses get some of the same kinds of gratifications that simple mands do. In this 'generic mands' and 'generic tacts' are de- veloped as subroutines. Roughly speaking, generic mands include such con- structions as the question and the imperative, while generic tacts correspond to the declarative construction. Specific morphemes or morpheme-groups such as water and the ball are then merely 'subroutines' called by these con- structions, and no longer have the behavioral status of mands or tacts-they are simply general-purpose responses which may be fitted in to either type of response pattern. It should be pointed out that such a model raises interesting questions about transformation grammar in the form developed by Harris17 and Chomsky,18 where it is assumed that kernel sentences in the declarative con- struction (N is A, N is N, N v V, etc.) are basic and prior to such trans- formations as the interrogative, the imperative, the passive, etc. This kind of analysis possesses great elegance and may be valid within the sphere of linguistic description, but it evidently cannot be immediately applied in a theory of verbal behavior. Transformation grammar seems to imply that in the composition of any utterance, the basic building blocks are the kernel sentences and that the speaker seeks out appropriate kernel sentences and combines and 'transforms' them to suit the total linguistic and socio-psycho- logical situation. The present analysis offers a very different description of the behavioral processes involved. It would assign priority not to the kernel sentences but rather to the transformations, if anything. For exam- ple, before the speaker chooses any kernel sentence, he is more likely to</page><page sequence="7">Operational Model for Language Behavior 43 'choose' whether he is going to respond with a generic mand or a generic tact. If he is going to respond with a generic mand, he will use, probably, an in- terrogative or an imperative sentence-type, depending on the particular stim- ulus conditions. If he chooses a generic tact, he will most likely compose a sentence in the declarative mode. The composition of the sentence itself can be thought of as the 'calling' of various subroutines; some of these subroutines may happen to contain the structure of certain kernel sentences in the declar- ative form, but there is no behavioral reason why other subroutines should not contain the structure of transformed kernel sentences. There is also no behavioral reason why a child, for example, could not learn an interrogative structure before he learns a declarative structure; therefore, one would be surprised to confirm Lee's expectation19 that the order in which a child learns constructions corresponds to the logical taxis of transformations. There is need for empirical data on this point, but I am tempted to make one observa- tion which may aid in assessing the correctness of the present analysis: namely, that in the languages I know anything about, it is in most cases true that the ordinally first immediate constituent of any kernel sentence or trans- formation thereof is highly predictive of what kind of transformation it is- zero or otherwise. It is particularly predictive of whether the transforma- tion would be classified as a mand or tact. For example, in English, inter- rogatives start with wh- words or forms of such morphemes as is, may, do, can, etc.; imperatives start with verbs. Even in a language with relatively free word-order such as Latin, questions and imperatives are usually sig- nalled construction-initially. Thus, from the standpoint of both production and reception, the mand vs. tact character of an utterance seems to be prior to is special form. The speaker 'selects' manding or tacting before he se- lects the components of kernel sentences, and the listener is immediately alerted to the mand vs. tact character of an utterance. The development of generic tacts which are kernel sentences such as (N is A, N1 is N2, etc.) involves the development of subroutines which serve to identify the components N, V, and A. Each of these, in turn, is probably learned as a special kind of generic tact; by the kinds of reinforcements ar- ranged by the speech community, the child learns to respond differentially to the several classes of stimulus properties inherent in his environment, and we can program a machine to simulate this activity. Here we must appeal to what may be called a principle of primary grammatical functions. In child vocabulary, most nouns refer to concrete tangible objects, most adjectives to 'free-floating' stimulus properties closely associated with sensation and motivation, and most verbs to physical movement.20z Whatever kinds of class cleavage may later occur, the learning of the kernel sentences and of the corresponding transformed constructions probably depends upon considerable stability of these relationships. Further, when such concepts as name, do, thing, and kind ('sort') are learned, the child learns a tentative classification</page><page sequence="8">44 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 1, No. 1 of stimulus aspects and properties. The question of whether a language sys- tem imposes a particular structure on the development of these concepts is one aspect of the hypothesis of linguistic relativity, and can be investigated in terms of the theoretical paradigms offered here. At any rate, later lan- guage development and all sorts of cognitive processes depend upon these classifications of stimulus properties; in terms of our machine programming, we will assume that the routine we call PERCEIVE STIMULUS involves an almost automatic sorting of stimulus properties along linguistic lines. If space allowed, we would take a look at further aspects of early lan- guage learning-the learning of various sentence types and transformations, the learning of morphology, etc., but it will suffice to say that the model would require no new principles beyond those introduced in Display 1. No new principles are re'quired, further, as we approach a considera- tion of how we might represent in machine language the mature performance of a skilled speaker. But the storage banks of our speaker would have be- come well stocked with a number of useful items-by this time an enormous repertoire of stimulus recognitions would have accumulated, arranged in such neat order as the total linguistic code of his speech community might impose. Associated with each stimulus would be its more salient stimulus properties, as well as a whole attic-full of representations of past experi- ences. Further, there would be a storage bin for a representation of how stimulus properties are associated in nature-the structure of these associa- tions is really what Osgood's 'semantic differential' explores, not essentially a linguistic problem at all. Finally, there would be a highly developed set of subroutines for the calling up of all these associated stimulus properties, names of events, etc., in connection with the production and reception of speech. Display 3 presents the hypothetical functioning of a machine program in a special kind of communication situation that Howard Maclay and I have' in- vestigated experimentally--one in which a speaker is required to describe an array of objects in such a way that a 'hearer' can actually identify these ob- jects on the basis of verbal codes alone.2' A full description of this program would include a consideration of the possibility of error, of feedback, and of 'editing'. Here I can only mention a number of important insights which this kind of 'programming' yields, and a number of problems for further study. First of all, it appears very plain that the instructions we give subjects in psychological experiments, and more generally, many kinds of things we say to others, can be regarded as invitations to the hearer to assemble pro- grams of thought and action, and indeed, as directions for the assembly of subroutines. It must be true, then, that the form of our directions should have specifiable relations to the programs assembled by hearers and hence to their ultimate behavior. As a corollary, it should be possible to investi- gate these relations experimentally.</page><page sequence="9">Operational Model for Language Behavior 45 Secondly, the problem of behavioral units now appears to be an almost meaningless question. The routines and subroutines which are probably ac- tually in operation even in the simplest speech performance are so complex and recursive that it hardly makes sense to think of units which stand alone and which must inevitably run their course without interruption. The be- havioral unit, of one is needed, has a status similar to that of the routine in computer logic. Nevertheless, on the side of language production as con- trasted with reception, the routine can also be thought of as the immediate constituent in linguistic analysis. Thirdly, a detailed behavioral analysis of simple communication situa- tions suggests that the stimulus control of verbal behavior is extremely com- plex in its patterning even though simple in principle, and that only a minor- ity of the variables are linguistic. Finally, the most interesting problem arising from this analysis is that of deciding where the choice points are and whether they are of a binary char- acter. Our knowledge of the organization of behavior suggests that all be- havioral choice points are binary; verbal behavior should provide an excellent field in which to study the problem experimentally. One approach is to try to build an actual machine program for generating sentences, the program being written so as to include only binary decision points. Display 4 depicts the programming of the performance of a subject re- sponding to Osgood's semantic differential. Essentially, the subject's task is to 'compute' the extent to which the dimensions of experience implicit in ('de - noted by', or 'tacted by' in Skinner's terminology) a given pair of semantically contrasting adjectives are in coincidence with the experiences ('mediating re- sponses') retained in memory about a specified stimulus. These latter ex- periences are acquired by general non-linguistic processes; what is of interest in the psychology of language and possibly in linguistics generally is the array of basic semantic dimensions implicit in sets of adjectives. These seem to 'tact' generalized stimulus properties. Unless we begin to concern ourselves with precisely how, in a neuro- physiological sense, responses get to be learned (and this is something we had better leave to the neurophysiologists), the operational model needed in the psychology of language is a relatively simple one. It can be reduced to a small number of statements about perception, reinforcement, discrimination, and performance. What contributes to the apparent complexity of the model is the fact that the basic principles are capable of generating higher-order systems of immense intricacy, including systems for generating still further higher-order systems as in a Turing machine. I predict that it will become increasingly useful to formulate hypotheses about language behavior in terms of a logic which can handle such hypotheses. Such a logic will be immeasur- ably superior to the strange little schematic diagrams to which psychological theorists have been addicted.</page><page sequence="10">DISPLAY 1 BASIC PROGRAMS FOR ACQUISITION OF VERBAL RESPONSES IN EARLY LANGUAGE LEARNING Assumed initial conditions of storage (the result of previous learning): 1. A repertoire of stimulus recognitions is available, i.e., responses to the routine PERCEIVE STIMULUS. This repertoire includes: (a) Recognitions of various environmental stimuli (material objects) and their gratification values, if any (positive or negative). (b) Recognitions of speech sounds of self and others, but the several sounds are not well discrimi- nated. 2.

It is an expansion of ECHOACQ, using the basic paradigm of TACTACQ in which repeating a response after an adult is brought under the control of any situation in which the adult seems to desire imitation to occur.)

The sequence is first established as a unit response, then as the components acquire form-class allegiance, they are dif- ferentiated out for recombination and insertion in other constructions. This program also simulates the child's learning that objects have names, that events have names, that stimulus properties have names.) high strength in controlling gratification for deprivation of generalized social reinforce- ment.)</page><page sequence="14">DISPLAY 3 PROGRAM FOR SIMULATING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SENTENCE (In English) Assumed environmental situation: An array of'simple objects (of different forms and colors, say) Assumed conditions of storage: The lexicon and grammar of English are now in storage, acquired by the programs shown in Displays 1 and 2; further, there is a repertoire of recognitions of stimulus objects and stimulus prop- erties, each with appropriate verbal responses. For illustrative purposes, assume that the machine has just been instructed to "describe the objects arrayed before you in such a way that the target machine can identify them purely on the basis of your verbal output". (This is essentially the 2-person communication situation which has been investigated experimentally by the writer and Howard Maclay.) These instructions cause the machine to ASSEMBLE the program specified below from various subroutines in its repertoire. We assume that the program has been understood and properly assembled by the machine. The eventual verbal output of the machine will in turn enable the target machine to assemble programs for identifying the stimuli. The program listing below starts just as the machine starts attending to the stimuli in sequence. CALL ATTEND NEXT STIMULUS PROGRAMMED (= routine by which machine 'finds its place' in the array of stimulus objects) CALL PERCEIVE STIMULUS (= as before, contains instructions referring the several aspects of the stimulus to storage, e. g. size, shape, color, etc., determining degree of familiarity of each aspect or combination of aspects, bringing this information with associated verbal codes to temporary storage with a set of pri- orities; if instructions call for special priority of any aspect, this is taken account of, otherwise the set of priorities of stimulus aspects is determined by relative salience of these aspects in the stimulus. [In the present case instructions do not predetermine priorities.]) CALL EVALUATE TARGET 'S STATE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING STIMULUS (= evaluate what aspects of stimulus are most salient or useful to target machine for identifying; evaluate target machine's probable state of knowledge concerning codes) CALL SELECT INFORMATION APPROPRIATE FOR TARGET (this integrates the results of the two previous routines and brings results to temporary storage) CALL TALK-DECISION (= routine which queries machine's state of motivation for communication; perceives appropriateness of the situation for talking, determines whether it matters whether target is ready, and if so, state of readiness of target; if decision is favorable, proceed to the next instruction. [In the present case, the decision is favorable.]) CALL MODE-DECISION (= routine which determines whether deprivation state calls for a MAND or a TACT. In the present case, the situation calls for a tact; this is a function of the following conditions:</page><page sequence="15">(1) the machine has received instructions calling for tacts (descriptions). (2) the machine has 'understood' the instructions and needs no further information. (3) the machine momentarily possesses all the information about the environment it needs, or at least the strength of deprivation is not insistent. (4) the routine PERCEIVE STIMULUS has not resulted in any questionable material. If MAND is selected, this routine is followed by a series of routines appropriate to mands; we show here, however, the sequence appropriate to the selection of a TACT. Each subroutine is assumed to contain various sub-subroutines governing the binary decision required at the end of the subroutine; a possible out- come, however, is no decision, in which case previous routines are called for more information. CALL TACT CONSTRUCTION (This routine first calls Routine NOMINAL, after which it proceeds to a routine calling for a binary decision between two general types of completions: [equative] vs [verbative] Assume [equative] is selected. CALL EQUATIVE (This routine first calls Routine COPULATIVE (including verbs is, seems, etc. and calling an AUTOCLITIC routine whereby any markers tacting the machine's own state of certainty, interest, etc. are added), then proceeds to a routine calling for a binary decision between two types of completions: [adjectival] vs [nominal] Assume [adjectival] is selected. CALL ADJECTIVAL (This routine searches temporary storage for relevant codes for stimulus properties not already subsumed under the codes used in routine NOMINAL) CALL UTTER (output routine; it is probably realistic to allow the utterance to be 'composed' in temporary storage ready for eventual utterance, much as a linotype slug is composed before casting) RETURN TO START OF PROGRAM</page><page sequence="16">52 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 1, No, 1 DISPLAY 4 PROGRAM FOR SIMULATION OF PERFORMANCE IN OSGOOD'S SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL It is assumed that this program starts just as the machine has been in- structed in some such terms as "consider each concept presented in relation to each bipolar adjectival scale presented, and assign a position for the con- cept on the scale in proportion to the appropriateness of one or the other end of the scale to that concept". (E.g., where is RAIN on the scale happy-- sad'?) As is the case with all such instructions, this causes the machine to AS- SEMBLE a special program for various routines already available in its repertoire. The following is a skeletal outline of such a program: START: CALL ATTEND NEXT STIMULUS PROGRAMMED (In this case, the machine finds its place in the array of printed stimuli presented.) CALL READ AND INTERPRET CONCEPT NAME (This utilizes various subroutines previously introduced, such as PERCEIVE STIMULUS, but it must also include subroutines which will refer to that part of storage containing various 'associations' and other learned responses to the referent of the concept named. These routines will sense the machine's memory concerning various stimulus properties associ- ated with the stimulus, either with high strength or low strength. One subroutine will determine whether the referent is to be inter- preted as a class name or as a name for a specific stimulus or event, and will predetermine what kinds of storage are sought,) CALL READ SCALE TERMS (This routine is similar to the preceding, in fact could be programmed as a repetitive loop with it; it includes, howvever, routines recognizing the scale terms as class names for stimulus properties, also noting certain basic dimensions of con- tra.st implicit in the scale terms, including the degree to which posi- tive or negative evaluation is implied, the degree to which rapid behavioral adjustment is implied, the degree to which large or strong behavior adjustment is implied, etc., and any other dimensions which may be relevant, Such implications will be represented as generic tacts under the control of stimulus properties of classes of objects. The results of these operations are brought to temporary storage for later use. CALL COMPUTE SCALE POSITION (In executing this routine, the ma- chine may recursively refer back to either of the previous two rou- tines in order to search for any further information that may be re- quired. The routine is quasi-numerical; to the extent that one or the other of the scale terms implies one or more of the stimulus properties of the 'concept', the temporary strength of that scale term is enhanced.) CALL OUTPUT (In this case, output is a pencil mark made along a scale; its position is a function of the temporary strength of the scale terms.)

It is an interesting proposition that there would be an almost fatal defect in the analogy if we tried to partition a single machine in such a way as to represent more than one individual: the defect consists of the fact that typical computers, even of the largest size, contain only one 'central control' through which all instructions must flow. There is some question whether one such central control would be sufficient to simulate the behavior of even a single real organism, which may actually contain a number of relatively independent control centers, but probably the assumption of one control cen- ter will suffice for the simulation of language behavior. 13.
