<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MIDDLE GROUND? Recent Archaeological Investigations from the Kaurareg Archipelago, South-Western Torres Strait Queensland Liam M. Brady1 and Kaurareg Aboriginal Community2 Abstract Collaborative rock art research in the Kaurareg Archipelago, south-western Torres Strait, has systematically documented an assemblage consisting of 232 rock paintings from three islands. Using computer enhancement techniques, analysis of Kaurareg rock art has revealed a dataset that incorporates artistic influences from both Cape York and other western Torres Strait islands. Initial archaeological surveys have also revealed a lack of the distinctive Torres Strait ritual sites (e.g. dugong bone mounds and bu shell arrangements) already noted from the broader region. Using these preliminary data, we evaluate Kaurareg cultural history in the context of inter- regional interaction, and recent discoveries in Torres Strait archaeology. We conclude that the Kaurareg 's geographical location - off the tip of Cape York - was the central transition zone between cultural influences from Aboriginal Australia and Island Melanesia. Introduction Recent archaeological research in Torres Strait has allowed Indigenous Islander and Aboriginal communities, and archaeologists, to learn more about local cultural histories, the history of broader social relationships, and the overall dynamic nature of the region. Since the late 1990s, considerable insights have been made into the pre- European culture of Indigenous Torres Strait communities. However, much of these archaeological data have been acquired primarily from research carried out in the mid- and north-western (e.g. Mua, Badu, Pulu, Dauan and Koey Ngurtai), central (Tudu) and eastern islands (Mer and Dauar). With the notable exception of limited research undertaken on Muralag by Moore in the 1970s (e.g. Moore 1979, 1986), the lack of archaeological research from the south-western islands - a large subgroup of islands located off the tip of Cape York - represents a substantial gap in our understanding of the spread of cultural dynamics, and recently identified chronological patterns in the Torres Strait archaeological record. The Kaurareg Archipelago (the term used in the 2001 Native Title Determination to refer to islands traditionally owned and used by the Kaurareg) is of considerable interest to archaeologists given its potential to provide details on the nature and scale of interaction with neighbouring Aboriginal groups at Cape York and Torres Strait Islander communities to the north and east (Figure 1). These islands and Cape York were also the scene of intense social interaction between mainland Aboriginal groups (especially the Gudang - an Aboriginal group on the adjacent mainland at Cape York) and Kaurareg. Ethnographic accounts from the 1800s clearly attest to a strong social link between Gudang and Kaurareg (see below), while other Islanders in the 1 Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia 2 c/o Kaurareg Elders Corporation, PO Box 60, Thursday Island, QLD 4875, Australia Figure 1 Map of the Kaurareg Archipelago, south-western Torres Strait, Queensland. Left inset: Ngiangu, c.25km west of Muralag. region also recognised Kaurareg as the group who had the primary link with mainland Australia. However, Kaurareg interaction with neighbouring Torres Strait Islanders was also frequent. In our first major paper on Kaurareg archaeology, we review previous research on Kaurareg cultural history and present new data - primarily rock art and preliminary results from archaeological surveys carried out over the past four years - that address influences on Kaurareg cultural practices and evaluate Kaurareg archaeology in the context of recent discoveries in Torres Strait. In this paper, we argue that the geographical location of Kaurareg - at the frontier between mainland Aboriginal groups and Melanesian-influenced Torres Strait Islanders - represents a distinctive transition zone where sustained interaction has resulted in a combination of cultural influences that are reflected in the pre-contact culture of the Kaurareg. The Kaurareg Archipelago and Ethnography Muralag is the acknowledged home island of the Kaurareg, although present-day Kaurareg, ethnography, and historical texts reveal that the surrounding smaller islands (e.g. Kirriri, Mawaii) were also used seasonally for subsistence and as trading and initiation centres (among many other uses) (e.g. Haddon 1904; Number 65, December 2007 aUStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 17</page><page sequence="2">A Middle Ground? Recent Archaeological Investigations from the Kaurareg Archipelago, South-Western Torres Strait Moore 1979). Although far removed from coastal southwestern Papua New Guinea, the Kaurareg maintained indirect links with Island Melanesia through oral traditions, and involvement in the complex canoe 'traffic' network that operated between the Fly River estuary and Torres Strait (e.g. Haddon 1904:296-297; Landtman 1927:208-216; Lawrence 1990). The Kaurareg were the only island-dwelling people in Torres Strait to be forcibly removed from their homelands (Sharp 1992:105-135). In the early 1900s, government authorities relocated Kaurareg from Muralag to Kirriri. In 1921 Kaurareg were shifted from Kirriri to Adam (then renamed Poid) on Mua. This relocation was made at gunpoint, and Kaurareg were restricted from travelling to the south-western islands. During World War II the community at Poid was moved to Kubin on Mua, and finally in 1946, the Kaurareg community began to slowly trickle back to Ngurupai where many make their home today. Ethnographic data pertaining to Kaurareg culture is limited primarily to information recorded from the 1800s. Brief logbook and diary entries recorded by captains, crewmembers and naturalists from surveying vessels travelling through Torres Strait (e.g. Jukes 1847; MacGillivray 1852; Moseley 1879) contain descriptions of Kaurareg cultural activity (e.g. burials and canoes). However, it is the testimony of Barbara Thompson - a shipwrecked Scotswoman who spent more than four years living with Kaurareg before she was 'rescued' by the crew of the HMS Rattlesnake in 1849 - that provides the most detailed ethnographic information (Moore 1979). Thompson's testimony is extremely valuable given that her information regarding Kaurareg culture and customs was recorded before the arrival of missionaries in the region in 1871 and the associated cultural changes that ensued. Thompson's testimony regarding topics such as ceremonies, rituals, social interaction, hunting, funerary rites, trade, food, and modes of cooking was meticulously recorded by the ship's artist Oswald Brierly (who himself recorded many aspects of Kaurareg culture through sketches and descriptions) (Moore 1979). Although the noted Cambridge anthropologist A.C. Haddon made three trips to Torres Strait, he did not spend much time conducting research amongst the Kaurareg. During his short time with Kaurareg, he collected only a few material culture objects, documented ceremonial dances on Muralag and Waibene, and collected information regarding initiation, totems, burial customs, marriage, house forms and rock paintings (e.g. Haddon 1890, 1893, 1904). More recent research involving Kaurareg has focused on oral traditions (Lawrie 1970); post- contact history (Sharp 1992); and the relationship between traditional use of the sea and its resources, and Kaurareg cosmology (e.g. Southon and Kaurareg Tribal Elders 1998). Interactive relationships involving Kaurareg and their neighbours to the north and south formed a key part of Thompson's narrative. Thompson noted the close relationship between Kaurareg and Gudang based on cultural institutions such as trade, kinship and oral traditions. Although Kaurareg and Gudang spoke noticeably different languages, Brierly and Thompson both noted that Gudang and Kaurareg were essentially bilingual, enabling them to communicate with each other. Brierly (cited in Moore 1979:120, 148) records children at Cape York supplying him with both the Gudang and Kaurareg words for various objects, while Thompson remarked that while on Muralag, both Cape York and Torres Strait languages were spoken, thus allowing for information to travel quickly across the region. Prior to her rescue, Thompson stated the only mainland group to visit Muralag was Gudang; she also noted that '[t]he mainland Blacks are constantly backwards and forwards, but they bring nothing but spears sometimes, which they make better than our people' (Thompson cited in Moore 1979:204). Relationships with Islanders revolved primarily around the totemic clan system (of which Cape York groups were not involved). Membership in common totemic groups helped to link Kaurareg with Islanders from the western and central islands (Haddon and Rivers 1904). Thompson also recounted continuous trading ventures involving Kaurareg, Badulgal (from Badu) and Kulkalgal (from the central islands). Other key social links include kinship, oral traditions, marriage and language. Kaurareg Archaeology Research into the antiquity of occupation in Kaurareg territory is limited to excavations carried out by three groups of researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In 1973, David Moore conducted excavations at two sites on Muralag's southwest coast (Figure 1). Moore selected this location based on Thompson's 1840s narrative which identified the area as a Kaurareg campsite and an area where Kaurareg canoe parties took shelter during the monsoon season (kuki). Site PW/1 consisted of a shallow (10cm) deposit containing small amounts of shell, bone, pumice and charcoal (Moore 1986:152). Site PW/2 consisted of a series of campsites on a linear dune deposit. Moore's excavation at PW/2 revealed an upper level (c.30cm) containing darker, organic sediments, and small amounts of shell, charcoal and pumice. Between 34cm and 40cm, an 'extensive earth-oven system composed of burnt stone, bone, and shell and charcoal' (Moore 1986:153) was discovered and recorded. Charcoal from the earth-oven was dated to 610±90 BP (ANU-1364) and represents the first indication of the antiquity of occupation at Muralag. Moore concluded that PW/2 was a campsite used repeatedly and may even have been visited by Thompson during her stay with Kaurareg. In 1984, David Harris and Anthony Barham (Harris et al. 1985) carried out an excavation at Frenchman's Cave on Muralag as part of their research into the paleoenvironmental and archaeological history of Torres Strait. Only half of their test pit was fully excavated (reaching sterile sediments after 60cm) after human remains (carpals and teeth) were discovered. Additional cultural materials, including stone artefacts, bone (mostly fish), charcoal and shell, were documented to a depth of 60cm (Harris et al 1985:40). They concluded that the site 'may be an occupation site, in a sheltered location at the back of the modern beach, used subsequently for a human burial, or it may be exclusively a burial site' (Harris et al 1985:40). The only other archaeological excavations undertaken in Kaurareg territory were two small excavations carried out by Richard Robins in the second Queensland Museum expedition to Ngiangu (Booby Island) in 1990 (Richard Robins, Everick Heritage Consultants Pty Ltd, pers. comm., 2007). This material (including additional rock art and geological information) is the focus of ongoing study. Results from these previous archaeological investigations have thus far provided little insight into the nature and scale 18 aUStralian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 65, December 2007</page><page sequence="3">Liam M. Brady and Kaurareg Aboriginal Community of occupation of the south-western islands. This is in marked contrast to the rapid and impressive increase in archaeological knowledge since the onset of McNiven and David's Western Torres Strait Archaeological Project initiated in 2001 (e.g. David et al 2004a, 2004b; McNiven 2003, 2006; McNiven et al 2006; see also Brady 2005; Crouch et al 2007; Rowe 2005). This lack of archaeological data leaves a significant gap in our understanding of both local (Kaurareg) and regional (Torres Strait) cultural history. To begin to rectify this situation, we turned to rock art - as a first step in a wider Kaurareg cultural heritage project - as a form of symbolic behaviour affected by interisland and mainland-island contact to explore artistic inter- regional relationships. Torres Strait Region Rock Art The earliest recording of Torres Strait rock art was by Haddon in 1888 at Kirriri and Pulu in 1898 (Haddon 1904). Following Haddon's early work, rock art was neglected by researchers for decades. The only recordings of Torres Strait rock art were largely opportunistic in nature, and carried out by amateurs, travel writers and anthropologists. Systematic documentation of Torres Strait rock art was initiated in 2000 when Ian McNiven, Bruno David and John Brayer documented the Kabadul Kula site on Dauan in the northern end of Torres Strait using digital technology and computer enhancement techniques (McNiven et al 2000, 2002, 2004; see also Brady 2006; David et al 2001 for further details of computer enhancement techniques used in Torres Strait rock art). After the success of this project, and further recording of rock art by McNiven and David on Pulu, Badu and Mua in 2001, Liam Brady was invited to undertake the 'Torres Strait Rock-Art Recording Project' as part of his doctoral research (Brady 2005). By the end of 2005, a total of 57 rock art sites (including sites where rock paintings were recently executed by Islander community members) (see McNiven and David 2004) from across the western and central islands were systematically recorded as part of ongoing collaborative, community-based cultural heritage projects. The goal of this research was to identify inter-regional interaction based on spatial patterning of design conventions across space. A total of 983 identifiable paintings were recorded and analysed using digital technology from nine islands and the tip of Cape York Peninsula (at Somerset). Although rock art recording in Torres Strait had its beginnings in the south-western islands in 1888, few additional sites were recorded from this area before our research. Sporadic recordings at Muralag, Ngiangu and Kirriri have provided a glimpse of the rock art tradition from this region. These recordings have also resulted in speculations concerning meanings and significance of the recorded images. In 2002, a year after Native Title rights were recognised for some parts of Kaurareg country, a collaborative cultural heritage project was established to document Kaurareg cultural sites. The first priority was to systematically record all previously-known and unknown rock art sites from Kaurareg traditional lands and develop management strategies for threatened sites (Brady with the Kaurareg Community 2004; Brady et al 2004). The results of this project, along with a review of the earlier recordings, are discussed below. Rock Art Recording in the Kaurareg Archipelago 1888: A.C. Haddon During Haddon's first trip to Torres Strait in 1888, he recorded a rock painting site at Kirriri using sketches and half-plate glass negatives. A total of six paintings, incorporating canoes, zoomorphs and an anthropomorph, are noted in his publications and unpublished notes. However, only the canoes and zoomorphs were briefly discussed. Haddon's recordings represent one of the few instances where meanings of rock paintings from the Torres Strait have been revealed by informants. Haddon (1904:358) noted that the zoomorphs (hammer-head shark, turtle, dugong) represent totemic animals, and two images of canoes are associated with markai (spirits of the dead). 1984: D. Harris et al. Only one site was documented by Harris et al (1985) - Frenchman's Cave on Muralag. They recorded Varied designs painted in red and white, some of which represent animals (e.g. fish) and some of which are geometric' (Harris et al 1985:38). Neither the number of paintings nor interpretations of the meanings or significance of the images was provided. 1970s-1980s:J. Singe During John Singe's tenure as a schoolteacher stationed at Thursday Island, he recorded two sites from the west coast of Muralag and rerecorded the site at Kirriri. At Frenchman's Cave on Muralag, a total of nine paintings (monochrome and bichrome) were documented. Motifs included marine zoomorphs, and geometric and linear shapes. Singe (n.d.:15- 16) stated, * without a doubt this site was a spiritual site' and questioned whether the Frenchman's Cave artists 'were heirs to a separate painting tradition, perhaps more closely-associated with the Aboriginal painting tradition as represented by rock- paintings at Somerset and Laura'. Singe (n.d.:17-18) also recorded the 'Buttertin' site on Muralag, where two monochrome paintings of a zoomorph and a 'rayed head or head-dress' were recorded in close proximity to two small wells. Singe linked the style of the Buttertin site paintings with those at Frenchman's Cave. He also speculated on a sympathetic magic link between the rock paintings and the wells. At Kirriri, Singe (n.d.) documented 13 paintings including dugongs, several hammerhead sharks, turtles, canoes and an anthropomorph. Singe (n.d.:23) again speculated that the zoomorphic paintings were related to sympathetic magic, while the site as a whole 'was probably associated with the spiritual belief system attending death' given its close proximity to crevices where skulls were found by Haddon in 1888 (see Haddon 1904:358). In addition, he commented that, stylistically, the Kirriri paintings were related to those of Mua and Dauan. 1985: R. Coleman In 1985, Ron Coleman (formerly Queensland Museum Maritime History Unit) led an expedition to Ngiangu to document the rock paintings (including late nineteenth and early twentieth century graffiti left by European crew members at 'Post Office Cave' - see Delaney 1990) contained in several caves around the island. Working with a professional photographer, more than 1400 photographic images were taken of the rock paintings.

Recent Archaeological Investigations from the Kaurareg Archipelago, South-Western Torres Strait Figure 2 Kirriri motif classificatory scheme. In a series of unpublished reports, Coleman describes the monochrome and polychrome paintings as consisting of anthropomorphs, watercraft, a range of zoomorphs (including crayfish, a serpent, a centipede-like figure) and abstract figures. Coleman also speculated about Southeast Asian and Papuan influences on Ngiangu's rock paintings. An anthropomorphic image was identified as 'being of New Guinea origin' (Coleman n.d.:67) while paintings of watercraft were considered to be of 'non-Torres Strait origin' and stylistically similar to Macassan or Bugi sailing vessels (Coleman n.d.:70). 2002-Present: L.M. Brady and the Kaurareg Community Surveys carried out by the authors on fieldtrips in 2002 and 2003, documented rock paintings on Muralag and Kirriri (Figure 1). Only one of the previously- recorded rock art sites from Muralag was relocated - Frenchman's Cave (Muralag 1). Additionally, slides of the Ngiangu rock paintings recorded in 1985 by Coleman were digitally scanned and subjected to computer enhancement. While several other islands from the Kaurareg Archipelago were surveyed, they did not reveal any additional rock art sites; however, a range of other site types were recorded (see below). The rock art site originally recorded by Haddon in 1888 was also relocated on Kirriri. Recorded motifs from the south-western islands were classified according to the Torres Strait 4-level hierarchical scheme (Brady 2005) (Table 1 ). At the highest level (Level 1 ), motifs are classified as Determinate (where a painting could be classified according to its formal attributes) or Indeterminate (a painting that could not be formally identified because of damage, deterioration or fading). At Level 2, paintings are either Figurative (motifs with formal resemblance to objects and beings) or Non -Figurative (abstract figures), while in Level 3 analysis motifs are divided into 1 1 Group Motif Forms, and at Level 4, motifs are further divided into 96 Specific Motif Forms. Of the 983 Determinate paintings recorded, those from Muralag, Ngiangu and Kirriri comprised 189 (19.2%) pictures. Colours used on the south-western islands include red, white, blue, black and mulberry, while images are executed as both monochrome and bichrome images. Rock Art Recording in the Kaurareg Archipelago Kirriri The lone documented site at Kirriri (Kirriri 1) is a small rocksheiter created by several large boulders leaning against one another, located approximately 35m upslope from a dirt track skirting the southeast-facing side of the island. Singe (n.d.) identified the site as the 'Badane Site'. A range of cultural materials have been noted on the shelter floor (e.g. European ceramics, a hearth, and fragments of Polymesoda erosa) pearlshell Table 1 Torres Strait rock art 4-level hierarchical classification scheme. 1 Indeterminate/Determinate 2 Figurative/Non-Figurative 3 Group Motif Forms Figurative: Palm Trees, Anthropomorphs, Faces/ Masks, Zoomorphs, Material Culture Non-Figurative: Enclosed Grid Patterns, Enclosed Geometries, Open Geometries, Linear Non-Figuratives, Dots and Dot Variations, Infilled Non-Geometries 4 Specific Motif Forms 96 Different Forms: e.g. dugong, rectangle variant, curved parallel lines, canoe, mushroom- shape etc. 20 ailStralian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 65, December 2007</page><page sequence="5">Liam M.

Singe (n.d.:13) also reported that a baler shell 'containing a residue of red ochre' and probably representing a pigment container was found on the surface during his visit (but was not observed during our recording in 2003) (see Moore 1984: Plate 29 for a similar pigment container collected by Haddon from Mer). The monochrome red paintings are in a relatively good condition with some pictures easily visible from a distance; however, several other images required computer enhancement to formally identify. A total of 27 paintings were recorded from the site (Figure 2). This number represents a considerable increase above the number of paintings documented by both Haddon and Singe. Some of the images recorded by Haddon in 1888 have preserved well (e.g. both canoes, hammerhead shark), while others have clearly deteriorated (e.g. turtle, dugong and anthropomorph; see also Brady 2007). Non-Figurative imagery is a more common occurrence at the site (comprising 65.4% of all images) although some Figurative images are large and visibly dominant on several panels. Computer enhancement was used successfully to clarify certain design elements on the two elaborate canoe paintings (Figure 3), and also to reveal two heavily deteriorated pictures that were too faded to be viewed with the naked eye - an anthromorph (Figure 4, left) and a a-shape (Figure 5) (Brady 2005, 2006, 2007). The shape of the latter picture is similar to the mouth of the warup drum, while the former features a linear headdress found on painted anthropomorphs in rock art from other western islands. Kirriri's Zoomorphic taxa (three turtles, one hammerhead shark and a dugong) were identified by Haddon as totem animals (while Haddon fails to identify these Zoomorphs as Kaurareg totem animals, all three were identified as totem animals belonging to Kaurareg, see Haddon and Rivers 1904). However, there is a discrepancy between the number of hammerhead sharks documented by Singe and our 2003 recordings. Whereas Singe noted three hammerhead sharks, we documented one. This may be explained by weathering, although computer enhancement was unable to detect any other imagery that resembled a hammerhead shark. The only information pertaining to the antiquity of the rock paintings is tentative. There is a lack of any superimpositions and no direct dating has yet been undertaken. However, based on Haddon's documentation and reproduction of six images recorded in 1888 it is possible to obtain a minimum age of 119 years for some of the paintings from the site. Although the paintings are not cornpletely exposed to the elements, the proximity of the site to the coast and the harsh coastal climate of the Torres Strait region in general, would most likely limit the age of the Kirriri paintings to no more than a few hundred years. Muralag 1 Frenchman's Cave (Muralag 1) is located on the west coast of Muralag (Figure 1). The site is a large, amphitheatre-like setting approximately 35m from the High Water Mark. The paintings are located on the rear wall and in a small, shallow recess at the northeastern corner of the site. Cultural materials recorded include Polymesoda erosa fragments, burnt and unburnt animal bone and a small hearth. Damage to paintings consists mainly of mudwasp nests, exfoliating rock, red mineral staining, and water damage to the lower-most paintings from recurrent king tides. While the paintings on the rear wall are visibly deteriorated, those in the small recess are fairly well-preserved.

Figure 12 Muralag 2, black and white conversion of a computer- enhanced bichrome Chevron (grey=white pigment, black=red ochre). documented (Figure 6). There is a marked difference in the quantity of Figurative versus Non- Figurative images. The former category accounts for just two pictures (a Stingray - Figure 7, and a Face/Mask), while the latter accounts for five of the six Non-Figurative Group Motif Forms (not present were Infilled Non-Geometries). Singe also noted a catfish and a shark which we were unable to identify. There is a wide- range of abstract imagery found at this site. Among the more common Specific Motif Forms are Triangle Variants, Oval Variants, Straight Lines, Parallel Lines, Wavy Lines, Extended Linear and Complex Linear designs. In addition, an Oval Variant was interpreted by today's Kaurareg Elders as representing a baidamalbaba - a traditional Kaurareg weapon studded with shark's teeth (Figure 8). The most visibly striking images consist of two sets of Five Vertical Line pictures positioned side-by-side in the recess. The vertical lines are executed in red and framed in white pigment. Singe identified these pictures as similar to a drawing on paper of an isopod by Gizu of Mabuyag and collected by Haddon. However, Brady with the Kaurareg Community (2004) also noted a resemblance between these rock paintings and sets of red vertical line designs recorded near the bow on the starboard side of a 1840s Brierly painting of the Kaurareg canoe 'Kai Marina* (Methven 1854) (Figure 9). Computer enhancement was used to clarify design elements on many faded pictures. The visual classification of 33 motifs compared with Singe's recognition of nine motifs demonstrates that many paintings could not be seen with the naked eye. Although a few pictures identified by Singe remain visible today, the site's proximity to the coast and its exposed nature makes it highly susceptible to water and salt damage and accelerated Number 65, December 2007 aUStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 23</page><page sequence="8">A Middle Ground?

No attempts have yet been made to date the art either through direct or indirect dating and there is only one superimpositioning relationship at the site. The difference in the clarity of these two pictures (Stingray painted over a Complex Linear) suggests a time difference between their execution, indicative of two painting episodes. Muralag 2 This previously- undocumented site is a partially collapsed rocksheiter near the base of a small hill, 12m from the High Water Mark on the west coast (Figure 1). The western section of the rocksheiter has collapsed leaving only the eastern section as the visible wall of the structure. A single panel of heavily deteriorated monochrome and bichrome paintings are located under a small overhang. Cultural materials are sparse and consist only of a few Polymesoda erosa fragments. Damage consists of patchy lichen and fungus growth, and salt and water damage. The site contains 18 paintings - 14 Determinate and four Indeterminate images (Figure 10). There is a noticeable difference in the number of Figurative (n=2) and Non-Figurative (n=12) pictures. Figurative images are a Fish and a Lizard/Crocodile (Figure 11), while Non -Figurative paintings are composed primarily of Open Geometric (e.g. Straight Lines, Arrows, Zl-shape Variants) and Linear Non-Figurative (e.g. Complex Linear, Hooked Lines, Rayed Line Variant) Group Motif Forms. The only bichrome image at the site is a V-shape painted in red and outlined in white (Figure 12). Computer enhancement successfully identified three images not discernable to the naked eye including an Extended X-Structure. The site offers little in terms of clues as to the antiquity of the art - there are no superimpositions. We speculate that given the coastal exposure of the site, paintings would not last for more than a few hundred years. Muralag 3 Muralag 3, another previously-undocumented rock painting site, is a small cave set into a small hill located near the coast, approximately 3km south of Muralag 2 (Figure 1). The cave comprises two chambers - a large central chamber closest to the entrance, and a smaller, darker, chamber at the rear. Cultural materials consist of several Polymesoda erosa fragments, glass, Western pottery and a hearth. The site also features some graffiti (names and dates dating to the 1980s) written in black and white pigment near the entrance. Damage consists mainly of block collapse, mineral staining, and white lichen spread across much of the rock walls. The red monochrome paintings are somewhat deteriorated, but not to the extent of those recorded at Muralag 1 and Muralag 2. No superimpositions were recorded, and only one picture was changed from Indeterminate to Determinate after computer enhancement. A total of 45 paintings (29 Determinate and 16 Indeterminate) were documented: 41 from the main chamber, and four from the rear chamber (Figure 13). Only one Figurative painting (a Crayfish) was recorded from the main chamber; the remaining are Non-Figurative.

Brady and Kaurareg Aboriginal Community Figure 14 Muralag 3, black and white conversion of a computer- enhanced Triangle Variant. Forms include Straight Lines, Extended Linear designs, Triangle Variants (Figure 14), Circle Variants, U-shapes, V-shape Variants, E-shapes, Parallel Lines, Zl-shape Variants and Oval Variants (Enclosed Grid Pattern). There are no clues to the antiquity of the paintings. Ngiangu Rock paintings were recorded by Coleman's team from four separate shoreline caves at Ngiangu. Since details concerning the attribution of the majority of paintings to caves are at present uncertain, we have temporarily treated Ngiangu's paintings as one group/site. Based on Coleman's photographic data, damage to rock paintings consists of extensive water and salt damage, graffiti from the various lighthouse keepers and their families, mineral staining, and fungus and lichen growth. The condition of the paintings varies from good to heavily deteriorated. Colours recorded reveal a range of pigments including red, mulberry, black, blue and white. Bichrome images use only red and white pigment. As yet, there is no information to assist in determining the antiquity of the paintings; only one superimpositioning relationship has been recorded and both pictures are of similar clarity. While computer enhancement clarified design elements on the vast majority of paintings, the technique only improved the status of three pictures from Indeterminate to Determinate. A total of 152 paintings (130 Determinate and 22 Indeterminate) were documented using the 1985 data (Figure 15). Of the 130 Determinate images, 14 were Figurative; the remainder (n=116) are Non-Figurative. Most of the Figurative images are Zoomorphs (n=10) and consist of both marine and terrestrial species (Crayfish, Fish, Fish/Dugong, Dugong, Quadruped, Centipede and Stingray). A dari (traditional Torres Strait style headdress) was also documented (Figure 16). Among the most commonly depicted Specific Motif Forms are Extended Linear, Complex Linear, V-shape Variants, Straight Lines, Curved Lines, Parallel Lines, Hourglass Variants, Oval Variants, Circle Variants, Triangle Variants, and Non-Geometric Comb-Shape Variants. Ngiangu also features 10 outlined Crescent Variants occurring in four clusters: three clusters of two Crescent Variants each, and one cluster of four Crescent Variants. Ngiangu has the highest number of Enclosed Grid Pattern motifs anywhere in Torres Strait region rock art (Rectangle Variants n=4, Oval Variants, n=4). Discussion Multivariate statistical analyses carried out by Brady (2005) on Torres Strait Non-Figurative imagery (the Torres Strait sample has 732 pictures, or 74.5% of the total assemblage; the small number of Figurative motifs was subjected to individual analysis) failed to identify the Kaurareg Archipelago (or any other group of islands for that matter) rock paintings as distinctive from the rest of the region. Instead, the statistical tests revealed a relatively widespread homogeneity between all islands across western and central Torres Strait. This widespread distribution of common motifs indicates a general spread of design conventions across the region. A more fine-grained analysis involving rare or distinctive motifs and comparisons using decorated material culture was also undertaken to further explore interisland and mainland artistic influences (see Brady 2005 for further details of statistical tests). An obvious geographical discontinuity evident within the Kaurareg rock painting assemblage is the ratio of Figurative to Non-Figurative motifs (Table 2). Non- Figurative imagery clearly dominates rock painting assemblages at Muralag and Ngiangu, however, a considerable portion of Kirriri's rock art is made up of Figurative images, including the only two canoe paintings documented from Kaurareg territory. Interestingly, Kirriri's ratio of Figurative to Non-Figurative images is more consistent with results obtained from documentation of rock art from the six islands north of the Kaurareg Archipelago (Brady 2005). Singe (n.d.:23) speculated about this discontinuity by suggesting that Kirriri was not Kaurareg territory, but rather, a 'neutral* island over which Kaurareg did not have any real control. He hypothesised that the Kirriri paintings were probably authored by Mua Islanders (Singe n.d.:23). This speculation ignores both the oral traditions of islanders (e.g. Lawrie 1970), and all ethnographic accounts collected from the region since the 1800s which clearly indicate Kirriri as Kaurareg territory. The notion of a 'neutral' island in Torres Strait was discussed by Brierly (cited in Moore 1979:233) and Moore (1978) forMt Adolphus (Morilagor Muri), yet even this island had a recognised ownership (Gudang). Kaurareg's extensive ethnographically-documented links with other Islander groups (e.g. Badulgal, Kulkalgal, Mualgal) through trade, kinship, and a largely common totemic clan system (see below) meant Kaurareg were partners in a shared and characteristic western Torres Strait cultural framework. Thompson's 1840s testimony indicated frequent visits from neighbouring islander groups, and Haddon's (1893) 1888 observation of a dance at Waibene involving both Kaurareg and Kulkalgal using characteristic Torres Strait dance paraphernalia is evidence of this interaction and cultural affinity with other islanders. This interisland interaction clearly reveals that Torres Strait cultural influences were consistently being encountered by Kaurareg. Consequently, the appearance of rock paintings bearing a 'stylistic' similarity to other images recorded from neighbouring islands (as Singe suggests) cannot be considered indicative of a foreign authorship.

Brady and Kaurareg Aboriginal Community sustained interaction, Kaurareg were undoubtedly exposed and participant in different manners of depicting subject matters. This interaction acted as an opportunity for the acquisition and exchange of information (artistic influences) through both conscious and subconscious social processes (Wobst 1977). The depiction of canoes at Kirriri is also key to understanding geographical limits of artistic influence. In 1992, Cole and David (1992:7) noted that the 'presence of canoes at Cape York and in island sites is distinctively Melanesian, since these paintings do not occur south of Cape York'. This remains true, however, Brady (2005) has recently observed a discontinuity in the formal depiction of canoes between those recorded at Somerset (tip of Cape York) and canoes documented from the Torres Strait islands. This discontinuity indicates geographic patterning in artistic behaviour in relation to canoe rock paintings from the Torres Strait-northern Cape York region. Depictions of canoes from Torres Strait (including Kirriri) are elaborate and contain many distinctive elements (e.g. central platform, flags, bow ornaments etc). Canoes at Somerset, on the mainland, are structurally comparatively simple with little elaboration. As noted above, the totemic referential system played a key role in socially linking individuals from across the western and central islands (Zoomorphs from Somerset are excluded since no information regarding totems has been recorded). Haddon's (1904) and Beckett's (1963) comments regarding painted Zoomorphs as representations of totems in various parts of the Strait suggest that analysis of Zoomorphs would possibly reveal some indication of totemic relationships (used to structure social interaction between totemic clan members) between islands. Of the 19 Zoomorphs recorded in Kaurareg rock art, 14 are identified as Kaurareg totem taxa (Haddon and Rivers 1904) (Table 3). Five taxa (Lizard/Crocodile, Turtle, Quadruped, Dugong and Fish) feature links with three western islands based on similar totemic depictions of animals (Dauan, Badu and Pulu) (Table 4) (Brady 2005). Thus, a correlation is evident between the depiction of Zoomorphs in Kaurareg rock art, and the distribution of totemic animal taxa from three neighbouring islands. Conversely, the geographical distribution of colours and painting techniques reveal links with Cape York. Whereas red is the primary colour in Torres Strait rock art (accounting for 91.7% of all recorded paintings), Brady (2005) noted that some secondary colours reflect the ethnographically-documented contact alliances between Kaurareg and Gudang. Mulberry and black paintings are found exclusively at Ngiangu and Somerset (although one set of now-faded hand stencils was recorded by Haddon on Pulu; see Haddon 1904) - reflective of close Kaurareg-Gudang social relations. Additionally, paintings incorporating white (monochrome and bichrome) account for 54 pictures across the tip of Cape York-Torres Strait region - 53 are located in the geographically circumscribed Kaurareg Archipelago and Somerset. Coleman's hypothesis for external cultural influences from Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea at Ngiangu is difficult to confirm at this time. The notion of a Melanesian influence on Kaurareg rock paintings is also difficult to discern. Design conventions commonly encountered on coastal southwest Papua New Guinea material culture and recorded in mid-western and north-western rock art (e.g. Concentric Circle Eye Designs, 4- Pointed Stars, Hooked Triangles etc; see Brady 2005, in press) are noticeably absent in Kaurareg rock art. Additionally, comparison between Kaurareg Archipelago motifs and those documented from Somerset revealed only a few shared motifs between these two neighbouring and ethnographically-allied social groups (e.g. E-shapes; Crescent Variants; Enclosed Grid Patterns, Comb- shapes; T-shapes) (there is also a lack ofidecorated material culture objects collected from Cape York to compare with Kaurareg rock paintings). This observation of a surprisingly small number of shared motifs between the Kaurareg Archipelago and Cape York is consistent with Brady's (2005:398) observation that, in the context of the Torres Strait region, a largely different visual system of artistic behaviour was in operation at Cape York. The data presented above indicate some obvious links between rock art from the Kaurareg Archipelago and elsewhere in Torres Strait. Among the moSt clearly defined are similarities involving distinctive motifs and design elements with rock paintings recorded from several islands to the north. Yet, some noticeable discontinuities also occur, including the highest proportion of Non -Figurative imagery from anywhere in the western islands being recorded at Muralag and Ngiangu (Non- Figurative pictures are also common at Cape York). Patterns in colour distributions and painting techniques also signal a link with Cape York. We suggest these results are reflective of the Kaurareg Archipelago's geographical position - at the southern- most end of the recognised Torres Strait artistic system, and at the doorstep to mainland Australia.

Recent Archaeological Investigations from the Kaurareg Archipelago, South-Western Torres Strait artistic elements from other Torres Strait islands and Cape York is indicative of Kaurareg rock art occupying an intermediate or transitional position between artistic systems. This intermediate or transitional position is akin to that of Dauan in northern Torres Strait, where McNiven et al (2004) documented extensive links with imagery found in southwestern Papua New Guinea material culture, and comparatively few with Cape York. While rock art has proved a useful tool in elucidating specific aspects of Kaurareg cultural history, our future objectives for exploring Kaurareg cultural history involve investigating chronological and ritual site patterning between Kaurareg and neighbouring Torres Strait islands. Data collected from ethnographic surveys by McNiven (unpublished data) and ongoing field surveys by the authors reveal some noticeable differences between observations of two distinctive ritual site types encountered in the south-western islands, and the mid- western and central islands. We have yet to document either dugong bone mounds or shell arrangements - distinctive ritual site types recorded and dated elsewhere in the mid-western and central islands (although early ethnographic observations have noted piles of dugong bones associated with graves, or in the form of graves, from Muralag and Mawaii; see Hamilton 1793:121; Jukes 1847:149; Lewis 1837:804-805; Moseley 1879:363; see also David et al 2005; McNiven 2003; McNiven and Feldman 2003). These distinctive forms of ritual expression are crucial in establishing interisland relationships across the broader Torres Strait region. Additionally, a large number of shell middens recently documented on Muralag (and targeted for future excavation) provide an opportunity to obtain more radiocarbon dates and a regional chronology from Kaurareg's home island. While McNiven (2006) has already noted that Moore's radiocarbon date from Port Lihou (610±90 BP) fits into the recently identified 600-800 BP occupational peak and period of social reworking, further radiocarbon dates are required to provide additional data on the antiquity of occupation on Muralag, as well as determining whether or not Kaurareg were indeed involved in any of the other recently identified major periods of cultural transformations taking place across the Strait (3800-4000 BP, C.2600 BP, c.300-400 BP; see Barham 2000; Carter 2004; Crouch et al 2007; David et al 2005; David and Mura Badulgal 2006; McNiven and Feldman 2003; McNiven et al 2006). Unfortunately, intrusion onto Kaurareg traditional lands over the last century by European, Pacific Islander, and Malay communities (see Shnukal 2001, 2004) has severely impacted the preservation of many cultural sites (especially at post-contact locations where Kaurareg were known to congregate, such as Port Lihou), more so than anywhere else in the Strait. Conclusion Although archaeological research in the Kaurareg Archipelago is still in its infancy, the rock art data discussed here reveal how the Kaurareg artistic system is positioned at the margins of the recognised Torres Strait Islander and Cape York artistic systems. The location of the Kaurareg Archipelago is crucial to researchers interested in the nature of interaction between mainland Aboriginal groups and Indigenous Torres Strait communities. With ethnographically-documented social interaction occurring with Islanders to the north and Gudang to the south, Kaurareg culture has been exposed to both Aboriginal and Melanesian cultural influences. What remains for archaeologists to discover is the nature of these relationships and their temporal dynamics prior to contact. While this paper represents the first sustained foray into Kaurareg archaeology since Moore's initial investigations at Muralag in the 1970s, Kaurareg archaeology is important because of its location at the doorstep to the hunter-gatherer realm of Aboriginal Australia. The antiquity of occupation in the Kaurareg Archipelago, the spread of a Papuan expansion southwards into Torres Strait 2600 years ago, and correlations between the age of rock paintings and identified chronological patterns for the Torres Strait region are key questions that remain to be answered.
