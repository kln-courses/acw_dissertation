Results showed that young publics in the United States and South Korea differently characterized CSR practices of multinational corporations and evaluated relationships with them. Young American participants evaluated the CSR practices of multinational corporations more favorably than did the young Korean participants. In addition, four CSR practices (internal environment, moral, discretionary, and relational) were associated with OPR dimensions in the United States, while only relational CSR practices were significantly related to OPR dimensions in South Korea. Overall, the findings highlight that cultural and societal meanings were embedded in identifying CSR practices and evaluating the relationship with multinational corporations involved in CSR practices.

Choi Department of Advertising and Public Relations, Namseoul University, Cheonan, South Korea e-mail: jhmi0410@empas.com Introduction With globalization, social contributions of corporations appear to be expanding and growing beyond the geo graphic borders of nation-states. The extension of corporate areas is also related to the notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR), which suggests that corporations should address social issues, such as overcoming poverty, enhancing employees' well-being, and improving the welfare of society. That is, multinational corporations have begun to take active roles in supporting and creating CSR agendas in different locations. In order to efficiently manage CSR practices involving more than one country, multinational corporations should understand the cultural values of these countries (Berger et al. 2007; Kim and Kim 2011; Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner 2004; Vitell et al. 2003; Wokutch and Shepard 1999). Yet, only a few studies have examined how CSR practices enhance the relationships of multinational corporations with their publics. As a general theory of public relations, the theory of relationship management has played a pivotal role appli cable to the general practices of public relations. Further, CSR practices can be discussed in terms of how they "enhance the quality of the relationship of an organization among key stakeholder groups" (Clark 2000, p. 376). However, CSR-related studies have typically ignored the social relations involved in practicing CSR and have used different measurements based on market-based cases (Hanlon 2008). In other words, CSR-related studies have rarely attempted to investigate the relationship between an organization and stakeholders, even though prior studies (Brüning and Galloway 2003; Clark 2000; Lantos 2001; Murray and Vogel 1997) have shown conceptual similari ties between CSR and relationship management.

Korea identify CSR practices of multinational corporations Many research frameworks have been developed based and relationships with them. Fundamentally, publics are on the belief that having similar historical and philosoph defined as "persons or groups that hold something of value ical traditions leads to similar social expectations or values that can be used as rewards or constraints in exchange for regarding business activities (Whitcomb et al. 1998). For goods, services, or organizational policies and operating example, people have different perceptions of brand equity standards" (Heath 1997, p. 28). Accordingly, corporations despite same brands (Sung and Tinkham 2005) and dif must consider relationships with publics when managing ferent decision-making processes regarding purchasing their business activities in terms of "supporting marketing products (Hafstrom et al. 1992; Mokhlis 2009) based on communication" (Swann 2010, p. 153). In addition, young cultural differences. Therefore, culture is a critical concept publics are considered a specialized market segment and "a in understanding how individuals behave in certain ways powerful consumer spending group" (Mokhlis 2009, (Ralston et al. 2008). p. 140). Young publics have a lower level of involvement Hofstede and Bond (1988) suggested that culture is "the in CSR practices as compared to older groups (Rifon and collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the Trimble 2002). From a strategic viewpoint, understanding members of one category of people from those of another" and persuading the opinions of less-involved publics is (p. 6).

Cultural Spectrum: The United States and South Korea In contrast, South Korea is linked to East Asian culture. More specifically, East Asian culture can be characterized as Multinational corporations have typically attempted to find exemplifying "emotional dependence, group harmony, business solutions that address "how to balance the need to cohesion, and cooperation" (Sung and Tinkham 2005, leverage global strengths with the need to recognize local p. 335).

Hofstede and Bond attention to perceptions and evaluations of CSR practices. (1988) suggested four key principles of Confucianism: Practices and conceptualizations of CSR in a society are highly related to ethical principles or social expectations. 1) The stability of society is based on unequal rela tionships between people; 2) The family is the pro totype of all social organization; 3) Virtuous behavior toward others consists of treating others as one would like to be treated oneself; 4) Virtue with regard to one's tasks in life consists of trying to acquire skills and education, and working hard (p. 8). The social desire or expectation in a society should be mutually associated with cultural values. For example, Kyosei is considered as a concept of CSR in Japan. Based on Confucian philosophy, Kyosei means "spirite of coop eration, in which individuals and organizations live and work together for the common good" (Boardman and Kato 2003, p. 318). Referencing Western culture, Wokutch and These four principles of Confucianism have been pre- Shepard (1999) insisted that "the motivation for CSR is a sented as key societal principles in Korean society; thus, generalized sense of altruism, the notion that one should Korean culture has been identified as having a high level of help others in need—even those one does not know collectivism. without expectation of benefit or reward" (p. 533). These different cultural values can represent different Therefore, cultural values have also long held a position of aspects of each society. Schwartz (1994) examined data importance regarding how people characterize CSR prac collected from more than 40 countries and determines that tices of multinational corporations, there are significantly different perceptions of core social values between individualist and collectivist societies.

For instance, discretionary responsibilities, emphasizing that they are not people in an individualistic society tend to create in-groups mutually exclusive. Carroll's four responsibilities have easily (e.g., family, school, and community), but then drop been widely investigated in research (e.g., Maignan and them once if they become inconvenient (Triandis et al.

Most of the instances, trust is defined as "one party's level of confi CSR dimensions (except relational CSR) in South Korea dence in and willingness to open oneself to the other party" were not significantly related to OPR dimensions, while all (Hon and Grunig 1999, p. 3). Based on this definition, it is the CSR dimensions in the United States were associated plausible to understand that young American participants with the OPR dimension. These findings are consistent have a high level of confidence in and willingness to open with the results of prior studies that have indicated that themselves to the multinational corporations involved in American publics have a positive point of view on business CSR practices. This result also supports the assertion that activities (Transparency International 2009) and have more normative activities of organizations may "create higher favorable attitudes towards CSR activities than do publics level[s] of organizational trust and credibility" (Seeger and in Confucian cultures (Chung et al. 2008).

Choi corporations may manage CSR practices in accordance with organizational size and product type, as the study attempted to measure the public's general perceptions on CSR practices. This study suggests future research for detailed investi gation of CSR practices. This study is aimed to know general evaluations on CSR practices. However, future research may focus on each dimension of CSR practices. For exam ple, it is also important for us to know how internal envi ronment CSR practices enhance the relationships between organizations and publics in specific conditions, such as organizational culture, system, and environment. Addition ally, researchers may explore how other variables affect the relationships between CSR practices and OPRs. Future research may pay more attention to investigating the effects of CSR practices in specific situations. To do so, future research may be designed to use experiment research methods to show more generalized results and casual rela tionships between CSR practices and OPRs.
