      <p>Studying animal behavior in the classroom is an excellent way to teach the nature and process of science. As a discipline, animal behavior is particularly well suited to facilitate integrative study and encourage students to make curricular connections. Students' focus can move readily from the organismal view "up" to the animal in its ecosystem or "down" to the molecular level as they investigate topics in animal behavior.</p>
      <p>Studying animal behavior is an excellent way to demonstrate the continuity of life and allow students to challenge their assumptions about nonhuman animals. "Why" questions serve to reinforce the role of evolution as a shaper of animal behavior and challenge students to move beyond Lamarckian explanations. Can animals make choices? Are all choices equally "good" (i.e., adaptive) ones? What do you mean when you say an animal is "smart"? What does it mean to learn? Do all members of a species behave the same way under similar circumstances? Collecting behavioral data necessitates the naming of behaviors, and the challenge for students is to avoid naming and describing behaviors on the basis of our human experience, the so-called sin of anthropomorphism. Unfortunately, a statement such as "The gerbil is frightened" tends to end the conversation – the student has named the behavior and transferred all the human associations of this state to the gerbil. Scientists will tell you that it is better to describe what one sees objectively and name the behavior accordingly. However, the complexity of nonhuman animal behavior is astonishing – and guess what? Hormonal and neurological studies have confirmed that, particularly in vertebrates, the animal has the equivalent physiological responses a human would show in the same emotional state! So maybe the gerbil is frightened.</p>
      <p>Animals feel pain. Animals recognize each other. And animals can be bad-tempered, deceitful, and behave like sociopaths. The line between the behaviors of humans and other animals is becoming ever more blurry as the scientific literature demonstrates that many animals lead complicated social lives worthy of the worst soap opera and experience a range of what can only be called emotions. Challenge your students to look at their data critically. And don't be so quick to generalize from a few data points to a species-wide trend. Alternative strategies to a goal are common and may be equally successful under natural conditions. Your data outliers or "uncooperative" study subjects might just be demonstrating an alternative way to solve a contextual problem! Encourage your students to relate what they see in their classroom studies to the animal's natural environment. Are rats smarter than cats because they can learn to run mazes more efficiently?</p>
      <p>There are several issues pertaining to the hands-on study of animal behavior in the classroom that I find troubling. Logistical constraints often lead teachers to select animal behavior experiments that involve invertebrates such as pill bugs, flour beetles, crickets, and the like. These animals are readily maintained in the classroom, but when the unit is finished, they are killed and disposed of with few qualms. What message are we sending our students? That animals are consumables like pH paper, and when they are no longer useful, they are trashed?</p>
      <p>If your students are like my students, they would much prefer to study "real animals" (i.e., vertebrates), but keeping those organisms in the classroom in sufficient numbers to permit valid study designs with replicates and controls is a regulatory and logistical nightmare. If you do manage to include vertebrate studies, what do you do with the animals when you are done? Cases abound in which released animals survive to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
      <p>Our challenge is to help students appreciate the interactions of animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates, in the world around them. Help students really see the animals around them – ants, squirrels, birds at feeders, gulls in parking lots – and apply their investigative skills to the study of these animals as well. Remember that the Internet includes many live feeds from "Crittercams" that provide unbiased views of animals in their "habitat," although that may be in an enclosure or a nest box. And what about the human animal? There are fascinating studies that students can do – human ethology – to use the skills they have developed to study the human, from pheromones on t-shirts to spacing behavior at the bus stop or in the cafeteria line.</p>
      <p>Including living animals in the classroom environment does much to bring our discipline to life, so to speak, in ways that YouTube videos cannot. In this age of "nature deficit disorder," it becomes especially critical that we help our students understand animals and their roles in the natural environment. The Animal Behavior Society recognizes children's books that portray animal behavior in an "accurate and compelling" manner ( <ext-link ext-link-type="url"
                   xlink:href="http://www.animalbehavior.org/ABSEducation/">http://www.animalbehavior.org/ABSEducation/</ext-link>), and these can complement hands-on studies. From an understanding of animal behavior will come (it is hoped) responsible decision-making as we seek ways to maintain biodiversity and coexist on this shrinking planet. But let's be aware of the complex message we convey to our students in the way we treat animals in our classrooms and in our curricula.</p>
