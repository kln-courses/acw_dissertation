Appealing to the ways in which we use anthropomorphizing language, I argue that at the root of this misrepresentation is a failure to take seriously not only the perceptual and epistemic centeredness of human experience, but the ways in which gendered and heterosexual- ized social norms have become naturalized among its features.

DIVORCING HUMAN CHAUVINISM FROM HUMAN- CENTEREDNESS Whatever other issues may distinguish ecocentrists from environmen- tal pragmatists from ecofeminists, few quibble with the claim that human chauvinism has taken its toll on Earth's environmental integrity. We need look no further than recent evidence of global climate change, resource depletion, species extinctions, deforestation, or water and air pollution to see that the future of human and nonhuman life may depend upon whatever collective will we can muster to address these looming crises.1 Unsurprisingly, critiques of this chauvinism vary widely according to per- spective and commitments. Ecocentrists, for example, equate chauvinism with human-centeredness, arguing that only the disavowal of the latter and the adoption of an ecocentric perspective will be adequate to the for- mulation of an effective course of action. Environmental pragmatists, however, reject this identity and argue that it isn't human-centeredness per se that is at fault for environmental deterioration but rather a lack of foresight necessary to the envisioning of a sustainable future. Pragmatist Bryan Norton, for example, argues for adopting a "weak anthropocentrism" that explicitly recognizes the interdependence of human and nonhuman nature in the formulation of values appropriate to a "future for human consciousness" (2003, 163- 174). Ecofeminists adopt (and reject) aspects of these and many other approaches, but are nonetheless distinguished by arguments that reveal the intimate and mutually reinforcing relationships between human chau- vinism, androcentrism, ethnocentrism, and heterosexism. Karen Warren, Carol Adams, Greta Gaard, and Chris Cuomo, among others, show how specific institutions and industries benefit from treating women, nonwhite human beings, and nonhuman animals as if each were valuable primarily as a reflection of that paradigmatic resource, nature "her" self. Whatever the strengths of each of these approaches - and there are many - none, I think, can accomplish an effective critique of human chau- 30 ETHICS % TH E EN\^RONMENX ^4,^2009</page><page sequence="3">vinism and its related forms of oppression without initiating a divorce of it from human-centeredness. There are at least two reasons why. First, there are very good reasons to think that human-centeredness is not in any sense a voluntary feature of human being, but rather an indigenous feature of human consciousness - unchosen and ineradicable. Second, I'll argue, not only do no negative consequences follow from this divorce, but rather the very positive consequence of an opportunity to rethink and re- value human-centeredness as a locus of practicable moral responsibility. However plastic and evolving the somatic, perceptual, cognitive, psy- chological, epistemic and affective capacities native to Homo sapiens, they are still specific to human - and not Chimpanzee or dolphin - being. Human consciousness is, in other words, informed by the unique articula- tion and interaction of capacities that characterize human embodiment, capacities whose exercise creates the conditions for human experience. To be clear, I am not suggesting that what defines human-centeredness is that human beings have capacities that other species of creatures do not - this may or may not be true given any particular comparison. What I am sug- gesting is that the unique configuration of capacities that describes Homo sapiens informs an experience unique to this species and thereby define this consciousness in terms of this configuration. A human-centered con- sciousness cannot then be displaced, disavowed, or disowned - the notion that we could get "outside" of human centeredness makes as little sense as the notion that there's an "outside" for human consciousness (other than permanent coma or death). Hence, I can care profoundly about the welfare of chimpanzees - I can try to imagine what it might be like to be a chimpanzee, and I might make excellent guesses given all of the percep- tual, somatic, and psychological similarities we do appear to share in light of the behavioral, anatomical, and other evidence. But I cannot experience the world like a chimpanzee because there is no "outside" to my experi- ence as a member of Homo sapiens.2 Philosophy of language and empirically oriented philosophies of mind/brain may offer the most persuasive support for this position. Doug- las Hofstadter argues, for example, that part of what distinguishes human beings from other species of animal is our specifically linguistic capacity for the crafting of analogies: "We human beings begin life as rather aus- tere analogy-makers - our set of categories is terribly sparse, and each category itself is hardly well-honed. Categories grow sharper and sharper and ever more flexible and subtle as we age, and of course fantastically "^R^ 31</page><page sequence="4">more numerous" (2000, 121). Similarly, Nicholas Wade argues that the aboriginal click languages still in use in South Africa demonstrate a ca- pacity for the development of language and its acquisition unique even to ancient human communities (2004, 191-4). In their now famous work, Philosophy in the Flesh, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that human beings "are the only animals we know of who can ask, and some- times even explain, why things happen the way they do. We are the only animals who ponder the meaning of their existence and who worry con- stantly about love, sex, work, death, and morality. And we appear to be the only animals who can reflect critically on their lives in order to make changes in how they behave" (1999, 551). The most persuasive argument, however may come from philosopher of mind, Daniel Dennett who, in Consciousness Explained (1991) asks: Do our selves, our nonminimal selfy selves, exhibit the same perme- ability and flexibility of boundaries as the simpler selves of other creatures? Do we expand our personal boundaries - the boundaries of our selves - to enclose any of our "stuff? In general, perhaps, no, but there are certainly times when this seems true, psychologi- cally.... So sometimes we enlarge our boundaries; at other times, in response to perceived challenges real or imaginary, we let our boundaries shrink.... I have reminded you of these familiar speeches to draw out the similarities between ourselves and the selves of ants and hermit crabs... Ants and hermit crabs don't talk. The hermit crab is designed in such a way as to see to it that it acquires a shell, and hence, in a very weak sense, tacitly represents the crab as having a shell, but the crab does not in any stronger sense represent itself as having a shell. It doesn't go in for self-representation at all. (1991, 416-417) Dennett neither denies that we share with other species of creature a vari- ety of overlapping capacities, nor does he deny that we can expand - im- aginatively and sympathetically - our understanding of what it might be like to be, say, a hermit crab. What Dennett does deny is that the hermit crab shares in common with us is the capacity for self-representation. Indeed, what all these passages point to is a configuration of capacities unique to human beings as, for example, language users, philosophers, worriers, and self-representers. None draw a hard and fast line between "us" and "them" - they don't need to. But what each example does illus- 32 |^^^</page><page sequence="5">trate is some element of what a human-centered form of life looks like, what capacities characterize human-centeredness. Second, then, is that however indigenous, no necessary implications for ethnicity, gender, sex, or sexual identity follow from human-centered- ness (or follow for our concepts of ethnicity, etc.). That we are, for in- stance, bipedal, color vision equipped, big-brained, sentient mammals implies no particular trajectory for human institutions other than for what falls within the range of physical, cognitive, and epistemic possibil- ity for this species of animal. That we cannot see out the backs of our heads no doubt affects our experience of our somatic and existential con- ditions, that we are sentient creatures able to experience not only physical but psychological pain certainly contributes substantially to the ways in which our points of view identify us as specific loci of experience. Specific capacities and limitations are not, however, determinations - while spe- cies membership delimits the possible, it does not define, for example, the "normal" or "natural" in any other terms but what can be. Nothing necessarily follows for human institutions like government, marriage, or family, however otherwise chauvinistic, sexist, racist, or heterosexist they may be. While human-centeredness is a defining characteristic of human consciousness, the ways in which we realize it is not. FRED BENDER'S ECOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE ECOCENTRISTS DILEMMA If I'm right about the character of human-centeredness as well as the plausibility of divorcing centeredness from chauvinism, the ecocentrist is faced with an insuperable dilemma. For the ecocentrist, human-centered- ness and chauvinism are something more like the unfortunate two-headed bulls of Ripley's Believe it or Not! (www.ripleys.com). Not only is no di- vorce possible, attached to the "body" of human consciousness itself, the two heads act as one driven by the presumptive prerogative to dominate and commodify nature. If we're to escape ecocide, we must sever both heads, that is, disavow human-centeredness (disavow this configuration of human consciousness), per se. Deep Ecologist Fred Bender epitomizes this position in a chapter aptly titled "Anthropocentrism and Human Chauvinism" from his recent book, The Culture of Extinction (2003). Appealing to Ralph Barton Perry's ~^^^^ 33</page><page sequence="6">"egocentric predicament," Bender argues for a set of claims that portend to show that what follows from anthropocentrism, "the claim that hu- mans cannot experience or think except in a distinctively human way" (2003, 83) is chauvinism: H [hypothesis] 8: Whatever human individuals understand is filtered through their own consciousness (egocentric predicament), therefore H9: Human individuals always act egocentrically; analogously as a species, H10: Humans cannot experience the world but through distinctively human consciousness (the putative anthropocentric predicament), therefore, as a species Hll: Humans cannot avoid acting from their exclusive species inter- ests, therefore, H7: [retrieved from an earlier analysis] Nonhuman beings are mere means (resources) for human use, therefore H4: [retrieved from an earlier analysis] Unrestricted human use of na- ture is morally justified (the human chauvinism principle), therefore N [norm]l: Dominate nature! (2003, 83) One serious difficulty here is that there are no good reasons to think that "filtered through human consciousness" necessarily implies egocentrically predisposed (Hll). Bender, of course, might respond that human history itself provides the best evidence. Indeed, in the second part of The Culture of Extinction, he provides a highly compelling account of environmental abuses and resource exhaustion (2003, 125-303). But no matter; for un- less Bender is willing to sanction the unlikely and deterministic claim that this history could not have been otherwise, he is still in need of an expla- nation as to why it describes the chauvinistic trajectory that it does. Without such an explanation, Bender's appeal to Barton begs the question in that the move from H8 (or H10) to Nl presupposes the very norm - human chauvinism (or anthropocentrism as chauvinism) - it is al- leged to establish. In other words, it requires either a leap of faith or an argument that Bender supplies neither here nor in his historical account to get from an experiential center (H10) to an ego (at least one from which we can derive consequences like "unrestricted human use of nature, HI 1 ). Moreover, Bender has not shown that any particular interests - much less 34 in^</page><page sequence="7">egoistic ones - necessarily follow from this configuration of conscious- ness other than, as I argue above, what follows from the species limita- tions circumscribing it. Even the instinct to survive and reproduce that we have in common with other species of animal does not imply egocentrism (especially when such means are not always or obviously conducive to either survival or reproduction). Hence, there are no compelling reasons to conclude the centeredness of human consciousness is any more neces- sarily egoistic than are the markings on a lady bug polka dots - however tempting it may be to see them that way. A second difficulty is that if Bender is correct that the centeredness of human consciousness predisposes (or just is) chauvinistic, then either we really are doomed to continue the ecocidal trajectory of our history or, as Bender argues, we must disavow our human-centeredness in favor of an ecocentric ("non-dualist") perspective and practice (2003, 397-404, 445- 9). Hence a first version of the ecocentrist's dilemma: If the ecocentrist is wrong, and it turns out that human-centeredness (qua chauvinistic) is an ineradicable feature of human consciousness (at least short of suicide), then we're doomed to precisely the environmental destruction Bender chronicles in impressive (if however despairing) detail in The Culture of Extinction. We are, in other words determined to "dominate the earth!" in which case we may as well just "hang it up," head out to buy Hummers, and buy stock in Shell. This, of course, is not a conclusion Bender (or any of us) would find acceptable. But if, alternatively, the ecocentrist is right, he/she must show how it is possible - at the level of conscious experi- ence - to dissociate that experience from the centered "I" of the subject who, in other words, has it in mind to accomplish the disavowal of the presumably egoistic self and permanently redirect consciousness towards the eco-centric.3 Bender undertakes this task in the course of promoting his specific version of ecocentrism that he calls "nondualism" but it is telling that, instead of offering an argument that provides grounds for rejecting the "dualism" of experiencing subject and experienced object, he resorts to an experience of "nonduality": I start out... in ordinary, dualistic, waking consciousness, feeling my- self a subject amidst myriad objects around me, each experienced as other. I discover I do not exist independently, but am like a node in a web, through which diverse kinds of energy flow. For example, I</page><page sequence="8">take in the Sun's warmth, the in-breath, food, water, human speech, and so on. Meanwhile, I expel many kinds of energy. Like the out- breath, speech, bodily movements, and excreta. The energy I take in and expel circulates everywhere on Earth, passing through others as through myself. Thus I discover my connectedness to all other beings, such that I, like they, am but one manifestation of this energy flow, of planet Earth.... Nonduality emerges as I realize further that natu- ral phenomena are Earth transiently manifest, empty of substantive selfhood (objectivity), since everything is dependently co-originated. Thus, though I am precisely emptiness of substantive or independ- ent selfhood; even so, as one particular manifold of relations, I am unique. (2003, 435) The difficulties here are three-fold: First, this isn't an argument, but rather an experiential narrative, hence it would be folly to think it could estab- lish anything other than that someone can have such an experience. But since such could be motivated by, say, exhaustion, illness, or the use of narcotics, it hardly establishes any metaphysical claim about the nature of identity or being - much less about any capacity to dissociate oneself from "substantive selfhood." Second, however much he may feel himself to be "empty of substantive selfhood" Bender's use of "P suggests that he confuses the capacity to conceive with the capacity to actually be so emptied. It's one thing to conceive of myself as connected to all other be- ings - indeed I do so conceive myself, I know this in the abstract to be true and I know of no evidence that contradicts it. It is, however, quite another thing to experience myself as emptied of selfhood. Moreover, it is simply false that what I can conceive, imagine, think, or even describe is necessar- ily something I can experience per se. Third, although Bender's appeals to intuition, mystical insight, Spino- za's notion of particulars as manifestations of nature (2003, 434-5), or Buddhist inspired meditation (2003, 436-7) might be compelling for someone already convinced that so-called nondualist identification with nonhuman nature is possible, these hardly suffice as an argument convinc- ing to the skeptic who may not share the necessary presuppositions or traditions. Here too, then, Bender's account is unconvincing - the ethical norm he derives from it (among others), "Form one body with all beings!" is likely to be mystifying to anyone unconvinced we can make this leap of faith from centeredness to "one body" or (as the moral dictum requires) from the "I" of subject-object dualism to the disavowal of my body. 36 ethic^</page><page sequence="9">Moreover, if I am right that there are good reasons to take the specifi- cally embodied configuration of capacities and limitations that describe human being seriously, no such dissociation from "I" is possible - in fact, it intimates precisely th^ dualism Bender rejects. However deep my feel- ings (spiritual sensibilities, affectionate sentiments, desires to connect) go with respect to my appreciation of natural objects and phenomena, I none- theless remain at the center of my embodied consciousness - and cannot be/do otherwise. Hence, one more version of the ecocentrist's dilemma: the dissociation of self demanded by the moral maxim "form one body with all things" assumes that I can dissociate my consciousness from my body - what else to call this but dualism} The notion that I could dissoci- ate myself without dissociating myself from my situated body to be "one with all things" is comprehensible only if I am not (at least essentially) my body, but rather a consciousness that, even if not fully independent, is capable of not merely conceiving but experiencing "my" body as some- thing other than bound by my own skin, that is, as not my body. Hence I must be dual - a "mind" that, in virtue of its capacity to empty itself of its "substantive selfhood," is merely in a dissociable body. No doubt, Bender would find this objection to his view onerous. However, when he advises us to try to expand our selves through, for example, meditation or to encompass an ever-wider set of relations with and to human and nonhuman others (2003, 423-4), it is hard to see how his view does not fit the dualist shoe. He writes that "[s]uch a practice, over time, should transform your sense of who you are as you discover you are not the separate skin-encapsulated individual you once thought you were, but that you belong to all other living beings, and that other beings are not really other, and that you yourself are not really the center of concern." (2003, 424, my emphasis) Again, Bender confuses what I can conceive with what I can experience - I can conceive myself as "not the center of concern," but not an iota of this moral recognition either requires or makes possible an experience of myself as anything other than "skin encapsulated." Bender hasn't, moreo- ver, the luxury of trading in his metaphysical commitments for the option that he's speaking "merely" phenomenologically or metaphorically. For neither the environmental pragmatist, who would likely deny the need to undertake such a practice in order to have a stake in the future of human ~ **** m^'^Nm^ RESTORING HUMAN-CENTEREDNESS 37</page><page sequence="10">consciousness, nor those who engage in such practices without a smidg- eon of the environmental activism Bender hopes will follow, are likely to be moved by anything but an argument for nondualism - and this Bender does not provide. RALPH ACAMPORA'S "ENCAPSULATES OF CORPOREALITY ' At least superficially, Ralph Acampora's response to the ecocentrist's dilemma seems to escape the implicit dualism of Bender's approach. Tak- ing up Thomas Nagel's anti-reductionist challenge in "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974, 435-50).4 Acampora asks whether "a phenomenology of bodily being can establish lifeworldly residence as a similitude suffi- cient to cross speciated differences" (1999, 119). That is, can conditions characterizing experiential or bodily place or residence provide an avenue for coming to know another organism's "lifeworld" as that other (1999, 118)? Acampora thinks so. Appealing to David Abram's adaptation of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's concept "flesh of the world," Acampora argues that because the bodily experience of residence can remind us of our exis- tential dependence and vulnerability, it also discloses the "organismic con- sanguinity," in other words, the intimate relationship between ourselves and others (1999, 122). He remarks that "[w]orld-flesh... constitutes a thoughtscape and lifeworld broad enough to incorporate conceptually and experientially transpecific incarnality," that is, a communicable sense of embodied dependence such that "the flesh-of-the world becomes mani- festly earth-as-home" (1999, 122-3). Then, within earth-as-home, it seems possible, argues Acampora, to gain some traction with respect to what it might be like to be (or at least be with), say, the bat - at least this appears to be what Acampora means in his reference to "similitude." If Acampora is correct, "[h]uman beings... can be envisioned materi- ally as epidermal encapsulates of corporeality. The convivial challenge is to interpret the skin-boundary not as an impermeable barrier but as a sur- face of contact" (1999, 123), that is, as something we not only share with other life forms - namely, penetrable physicality located on the very sur- face of our skin - but can experience transpecifically, or as a "flesh of the world" irrespective of our particularity. Of course Acampora is right that skin is permeable. From this fact, however, nothing necessarily follows for my experience of myself as encapsulated - as "I" - other than that I am indeed as physically vulnerable as is the surface of my skin porous, 38 EFfflS^ 14(1) 2009</page><page sequence="11">and that this is true of other species of creature as well. That's it. Cer- tainly nothing follows that implies the metaphysical weight of "transpe- cific incarnality." That Acampora assumes that being able to conceive of physicality as penetrable implies being able to, say, experience the world as transpecific commits him to Bender's fatal error - it is one thing to envi- sion (conceive) oneself as an "encapsulate of corporeality," but it is quite another to experience oneself as such. I can perfectly well conceive of myself as this spatially located - residenced - "encapsulate," but in order to experience myself through this concept I need to be able to "step out- side" or objectify the very "skin-boundary" that informs my experience per se. In other words, I must effectively disavow my self via the adoption of a concept of my "self" as "encapsulate" or "contact surface" - I must knowingly dissociate my self from "my" "self." Contrary to Acampora, then, the "convivial challenge" is not "to interpret the skin-boundary as a surface of contact." To accomplish this I must already have objectified my self via the concept of "encapsulate." The convivial challenge is whether I can objectify my self qua encapsulate, and this, I suggest, cannot be ac- complished without importing the very dualist baggage Acampora rejects, which is to say it cannot be accomplished at all. While Acampora doesn't argue for it directly, like Bender he appears to assume that the adoption of more environmentally responsible prac- tices hinges on our being able to comprehend the experience of others as expanded versions of ourselves as we come to be able to identify with them via "contact surfaces." Hence it seems likely that he equates cen- teredness with chauvinism - why else risk the methodological dualism?5 Acampora insists that we embrace the fact of our physical dependence, our corporeality as residence or home, and he seems to assume that only an environmental sensibility borne of the right experience will yield adequate resolve for environmental activism. But this is clearly mistaken - I can em- brace the fact of my corporeality, surmise it's connectedness to that of oth- ers, take this seriously as a foundation for environmental responsibility, and never have the experiences either he or Bender lean on so heavily to ground that responsibility. In fact, such experience could be impossible for me even if it were possible for others due to, say, congenital quadriplegias. But this does not imply that I can't think my way through to environmen- tal activism, and, if I'm right about human-centeredness, this avenue just might be more promising - and more inclusive - anyways. - J^~â¢^Â£LÂ£E RESTORING HUMAN-CENTEREDNESS 39</page><page sequence="12">Acampora and Bender might respond that we should take it at face value that they have had the validating experiences to which they lay claim. "Who are you," they might ask, "to deny that one might, say, via meditation or other spiritually oriented practices, have the experience of self-expansion?" However, this objection fails despite its emotional ap- peal. That I can feel myself "expanded" or "in touch" or "one with" natu- ral objects and phenomena is not evidence by itself that I am so expanded, etc. with them - after all, I can produce this experience through the use of psychotropic drugs, but that would hardly qualify it as evidence that such an experience has metaphysical credentials. Moreover, it leaves out all those (like the quadriplegic) who, having no or radically different a con- ception and experience of embodiment - may have neither access nor even concept of such an expansion. They might continue, "Not every insight is the product of logical reasoning." True, but for those destined to serve as the basis of as radical a self-disavowal as that stipulated by ecocentrism, we are surely justified in demanding something more than an assertion of experience. Acampora and Bender could also object that such an expansion doesn't require a disavowal of self and hence is not necessarily dualistic at all. But this too fails in that (1) the disavowal of the self is central to ecocentric ethics precisely because the self is identified with a centeredness mistakenly coded as chauvinistic by the ecocentrist; the ecocentrist cannot renege here without giving up the very grounds upon which he/she criti- cizes human-centeredness - however mistaken they may be about it. (2) While they might reject the logic of self/other altogether in favor of some experientially grounded "oneness," this doesn't get us very far. After all, we could no more obviously envision a practicable environmental respon- sibility following from the pacifism this implies than from the activism Bender and Acampora hope for. Moreover, it simply excludes all of us whose experience does not "achieve" or conform to it. (3) Both Acampo- ra's and Bender's arguments are - denial notwithstanding - implicitly du- alistic, and thus inevitably run aground on Cartesian-style shoals for the reasons I've offered. Alternative interpretations of the expansive "I" fare little better - an "I" that appropriates the other into itself is hardly a rejec- tion of chauvinism and a complete dissociation of self faces the problems in (2). The real problem, I think, is that Bender and Acampora simply fail to take seriously enough the meaning of the embodiment or "encapsula- 40 ETHICS &amp;THE ENVIRONMENT, 14(1) 2009</page><page sequence="13">tion" to which they themselves appeal - if they did, they would see that human-centeredness is not the enemy of environmental responsibility, but its most vital ally. THE HETEROSEXUALISM OF ANTHROPOMORPHIZING LANGUAGE USE The right response to the Ecocentrist's dilemma is to simply cut what is really just a chimerical Gordian knot by severing centeredness from chauvinism, a task made simple when we realize that the former does not, in fact, imply the latter. So why, then, have more environmental phi- losophers not taken this course? I think part of the answer lay in taking too little seriously - despite protestations to the contrary - the specifically embodied, raced, sexed, gendered, and epistemically situated configura- tion of capacities and limitations we really are. It is one thing to assert our physical "encapsulation," but quite another to explore of what this consists - especially in light of the social and political institutions that inform specifically human experience. Ironically, what the ecocentrist fails to adequately appreciate is precisely what ecofeminists have long recog- nized, namely, the extent to which our physical dependency informs our very experience of the world not merely as corporeal, but as raced, sexed, and gendered - these too form a crucial aspect of residence or place. Liberated from this two-headed bull, we are now in a position to craft better tools for the critique of practices and institutions that concern environmental activists across virtually any approach not committed to ecocentrism (ecofeminism, environmental pragmatism, the stewardship movement). My aims, then, are to articulate a human-centered environ- mental conscience capable of sustaining the activism we want without wasting precious time and energy in the forlorn effort to deny our human experience. It includes an implicit sensibility for matters of social justice precisely because its aim is to comprehend the relationship between en- vironmental destruction; the human institutions responsible for such de- struction; and the effects on human beings, nonhuman, animals, and the ecological systems upon which we all depend. Such an approach can show that matters of social justice are such an intimate part of understanding the causes of environmental destruction that any theory that eschews the former is likely to distort its evaluation of the latter.6 Taking, then, the concept of "liberation" as my point of departure, my next task is to ar- WENDY LYNNE LEE RESTORING HUMAN-CENTEREDNESS 41</page><page sequence="14">ticulate in just what such better tools consist, and why they make possible a more effective environmental activism. To this end, I'll briefly explore a practice I take to be epistemic bed- rock with respect to our relationship to nonhuman nature, namely, our use of anthropomorphizing language to describe and explain the behavior of nonhuman animals and things. My specific focus, however, is on how that relationship comes to be heterosexualized and gendered through such linguistic practices. The heterosexualizing of nonhuman nature, I suggest, is not merely a function of anthropomorphizing, but a basic function, that is, a function without which we would experience nonhuman nature in substantially different ways. What we discover, in fact, is that such linguis- tic practices are not only gendered, but that they serve to naturalize and thereby normalize a heterosexist view of the nonhuman world which then reinforces asymmetrical divisions of status and power reflected in institu- tions like church, family, and the military.7 "Basic," then, does not imply "determined" or "inevitable," but rather "naturalized" in that what is re- flected in our linguistic practices - in anthropomorphizing especially - are the specific ways in which human beings have institutionalized relation- ships of prerogative and power. To anthropomorphize is to treat nonhuman entities or systems as if they exhibited distinctively human qualities. Disney movies may be the quintessential example. Dancing penguins, talking cars, and singing flow- ers entertain us because they are us - as penguins, cars, and flowers. Re- gardless whether the object of our anthropomorphizing is a living or a nonliving thing, an animated character from Happy Feet (Warner Broth- ers 2006) or a nonhuman animal from March of the Penguins (Warner Brothers 2005) what we attribute to them are qualities we recognize in ourselves, for example, fear, desire, envy, empathy, temptation, sadness, joy, and so on. As I have argued elsewhere, anthropomorphizing fulfills a number of valuable purposes, especially with respect to explaining behav- ior that might otherwise remain obscure (1996). We speak usefully of bee "dances," "vicious" viruses, "industrious" ants, and the "desires" of flow- ers to warm themselves in the sun - to say nothing of the human qualities we attribute to our dogs and cats. It's not, however, merely in ordinary discourse that anthropomor- phizing plays a valuable role, but in scientific discourse as well. Consider, for example, Meredith Small's discussion of cognitive ethologists' Mitani 42 ETHICS lyTOEE^ *"*""** "</page><page sequence="15">and Waters' explanation of chimpanzee hunting behavior in "Sigma Chi Chimpy: Forget the Ladies - For Chimps, Hunting is About Fraternity" (2001). Mitani and Waters found that the number of males in the [Chimpan- zee] group, not the presence of estrous females, best predicted ac- tive hunting. Males also shared meat more with one another than with any female, and they did so reciprocally: give me some of yours and I'll give you some of mine. Those males who routinely shared the spoils also formed partnerships in other arenas; they groomed one another more often and aided one another in fights. Chimpanzee hunting is not about using scarce and valuable resources to attract females, Mitani says it's about using this resource to form and build alliances with other males. (2001, 26, my emphasis) Whatever the actual cognitive capacities of our nearest primate relatives, Mitani and Waters' use of anthropomorphizing language helps shed light on the behavior of hunting males. "Give me some of yours and I'll give you some of mine" attributes cognitive states (not to mention linguistic capacities) to animals who may or may not have them, but whether they do is beside the point since the states are attributed, as Daniel Dennett puts it "as if" (1987, 14-35). It can be, in other words, explanatorily useful - even in some scientific contexts - to anthropomorphize, to adopt what Dennett calls an "inten- tional stance," so long as we remain clear about its "as if" disclaimer, and so long as we treat questions about whether some species of nonhuman animals (or even things like wall thermometers) really have such states as distinct from those about what makes for the content of good - useful and predictive - explanation. As Dennett puts it: Here's how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose be- havior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in light of its beliefs. (1987, 17) The key phrase for my purposes here is "what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place and purpose in the world." Consider the chim- panzees. There may be more to what appears explanatorily useful in this passage than what may in fact be so in that what seems to shed light</page><page sequence="16">on male chimpanzee behavior depends on our assumptions about rela- tionships among them. It depends, that is, on what beliefs we think they ought to have. But what we discover when we examine the passage more closely is that what governs how we ascribe beliefs to the chimpanzees are our beliefs about what human relationships ought to be like - in this case, composed of "ladies," presumably gentlemen, and heterosexual. In other words, if we find Mitani and Waters' explanation useful, it may be because we identify with the presuppositions reflected in the article's title, "Sigma Chi Chimpy: Forget the Ladies - For Chimps, Hunting is About Fraternity." Note that I'm not suggesting that Mitani and Waters' provide a poor explanation or poor science, what I am suggesting is that it may not be possible to determine whether they offer good accounts of, say, male Chimpanzee behavior without gaining a more perspicuous view of what it means to attribute beliefs that something ought to have. My view is that if we peel back the outermost layer of this "ought" - just as if we peel back the outermost layer of what's contained in "chau- vinism" - we will discover that we gender and heterosexualize in the very course of assigning human characteristics to nonhuman animals and things precisely because these are the characteristics we implicitly regard as the most basic and "normal" in human beings. Taken for granted, these are the qualities we expect to experience in our observations and inter- actions with nonhuman beings, hence it's hardly surprising that we do. Among the objectives of any persuasive feminist theory has been to offer an account of how gender, race, and sexual identity have come to be con- structed, who benefits, and at the expense of whose labor. While it's not my aim to recapitulate these accounts, their relevance to environmental philosophy is clear: anthropomorphizing does not occur in an historical vacuum, but within very rich and specific social and political contexts, that is, within otherwise innocuous sounding phrases like "given its goals and place in the world." Feminist theorist Emily Martin's discussion of the ways in which the interaction of egg and sperm is described in popular and scientific litera- ture regarding reproductive biology offers another useful example. Look- ing specifically to scientific language, she writes: Take the egg and the sperm. It is remarkable how "femininely" the egg behaves and how "masculinely" the sperm. The egg is seen as large and passive. It does not move or journey, but passively "is trans- 44 ETM^^</page><page sequence="17">ported," "is swept," or even "drifts" along the fallopian tube. In utter contrast, sperm are small, "streamlined," and invariably active. They "deliver" their genes to the egg, "activate the developmental program of the egg," and have a velocity that is often remarked upon. Their tails are "strong" and efficiently powered. Together with the forces of ejaculation, they can "propel the semen into the deepest recesses of the vagina. (1999, 181-2) It's hard to imagine even Francis Bacon more thoroughly anthropomor- phizing egg and sperm, but key to addressing the question whether such anthropomorphizing is useful is gaining a clear view of the presupposi- tions naturalized in it. As Martin puts it, "That these stereotypes are now being written in at the level of the cell constitutes a powerful move to make them seem so natural as to be beyond alteration" (1999, 186). Examples such as Martin's suggest that the gendering and heterosexu- alizing of natural phenomena operates not only normatively, but epistemi- cally, that is, not merely at the level of how some may think things ought to be, but at the level of how we think things are. Naturalized in the very language we take to present us an objective view of the world, namely, sci- entific language, such descriptions effectively normalize a view of nature "her" self that while certainly chauvinistic with respect to its images of ag- gression and domination would not be adequately accounted for without an explanation of its gendered and heterosexist character. For Martin, the import of anthropomorphizing and heterosexual- izing something as fundamental as reproductive cell biology cannot be overestimated: Endowing egg and sperm with intentional action, a key aspect of per- sonhood in our culture, lays the foundation for the point of viability being pushed back to the moment of fertilization. This will likely lead to greater technological developments and new forms of scrutiny and manipulation, for the benefit of those inner "persons": court-ordered restrictions on a pregnant woman's activities in order to protect her fetus, fetal surgery, amniocentesis, and rescinding of abortion rights, to name but a few examples.... More crucial, then, than what kinds of personalities we bestow on cells is the very fact that we are doing it at all. This process could ultimately have the most disturbing social consequences. (1999, 186) Insofar as the kinds of personalities we bestow on cells is modeled after inequitable social relationships (and vice versa), it is no wonder that the ~ ~ - - -- - jhtsJ^^ 45</page><page sequence="18">latter continue to be solicited to justify not only the male, but the white, capitalist, Western, industrialized exploitation rightly associated with en- vironmental destruction and resource exhaustion. RESTORING HUMAN-CENTEREDNESS TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIENCE The critique of the heterosexualizing function of anthropomorphizing language is vital to the ongoing struggle to resist sexism, heterosexism, and all other forms of oppression.8 It can show us not only one basic way that institutions and practices which privilege and reinforce sexism and heterosexualism become defined as normative, but how heterosexualism itself has become a naturalized feature of our expectations, of our epis- temic and linguistic situations (our "place and purpose in the world"), and thus of the ways in which we experience ourselves as perceiving, "residenced," embodied beings. It is no wonder that the ecocentrist in- terprets as chauvinistic human actions characterized by their oppressive consequences - what ecofeminist critiques shows, however, is that oppres- sion itself is governed not only by human privilege, but by the sexed, raced, and heterosexualized epistemic conditions of human experience and language. What analyses like Martin's show is that, even at a level of descrip- tion taken to be objectively testable, not only chauvinistic, but heterosex- ist constructions of the "real" come to be understood as a reflection of nature "her" self. It is unsurprising, then, that the ecocentrist mistakes chauvinism for human-centeredness per se. Failing to recognize the pri- marily white, male, and Western face of chauvinism, it matters less to the ecocentrist how human institutions become implicated in environmental destruction, only that they do - yet this is precisely what invites the de- terminism that jeopardizes the ecocentrist approach. This lacuna is made poignantly clear in Bender's discussion of ecofeminism where, although he rightly credits Karen J. Warren's insight that dualisms of mind and body, male and female, human and animal, civilization and nature solicit oppression (2003, 364-5), he nevertheless erects a false dichotomy of his own by pitting ecofeminism's concern for social justice against the ecocen- trist's preoccupation with avoiding ecocide (2003, 365-70). By insisting that the only way to escape ecocide is to disavow pre- cisely that which women have been systematically denied for virtually 46 ElTfflCS^^</page><page sequence="19">the whole of human history - the opportunity to experience and develop a humanly-centered self - Bender effectively reproduces in ecocentrism the male privilege he otherwise eschews. Who, after all, is in a position to disavow their self-interest but those who have enjoyed the material opportunity to realize it? Who are these if not primarily white, Western men? As Bruno Latour puts it: "it is simply a matter of asking the militant ecologists to stop being so naive as to believe that they are defending, under cover of nature, something other than a particular viewpoint, that of Westerners. When they speak of putting an end to anthropocentrism, they manifest their own ethnocentrism" (2002, 32). That male privilege is built into Bender's view is not surprising - it follows from the conflation of human-centeredness with human chauvin- ism, all the while failing to register the significance of the historical fact that the "lion's share" of environmental destruction has been sponsored, financed, and wrought by men (pun intended). The central point, however, is that this criticism applies to any ecocentric perspective: First, philosoph- ically - because the best arguments for ecocentrism turn out to be ques- tion-begging. And second, practically - because the failure to recognize that human chauvinism assumes a prerogative enjoyed primarily by men risks the reproduction of future oppression, even in an ecologically sus- tainable "utopia." In short, where among the most foresightful versions of ecocentrism, Bender's and Acampora's, fail to lay down the welcome mat for women - particularly feminists - ecocentrism is in trouble. That ecological feminists might respond to Bender's moral axiom "form one body with all beings" with incredulity in the face of a history of oppression also makes Martin's point all the more compelling - that we anthropomorphize the actions of cells at all raises the first question with respect to who benefits from the use of the intentional stance. In other words, human chauvinism is not about human benefit per se, but about who benefits. Heterosexualist anthropomorphizing simply reinforces a construction of "who" that guarantees such benefits to those identified not as passive recipient "eggs," but as active and deliberate "sperms." Dennett, however, is also correct - there remains an important place in the explanation of behavior, including scientific explanation, for at- tributing human characteristics to nonhuman animals and things. In fact, it is hard to imagine the sciences without the powerful explanatory tool provided by this "as if." It is, however, at the very juncture of the "as if" __ __,__ WENDY LYNNe7eEâ¢J^^ 47</page><page sequence="20">that the crucial link between environmental responsibility and social jus- tice is forged. Why? Because the moment we treat something as if she/he/it exhibited human qualities, we have already gendered and heterosexual- ized her/him/it via the norms naturalized by our "forms of life." This is so not because we cannot do otherwise, but because the use of gendered and heterosexualizing language is basic to the ways in which we experience a world whose most fundamental institutions - family, government, mili- tary, capitalist enterprise, and religion - remain dominated by those men who promote their ideologies and are responsible for the ongoing corn- modification and exploitation of women, nonhuman animals, indigenous peoples, and the environment. The "how," then, of the role of human institutions matters to the de- velopment of an environmental conscience precisely because these insti- tutions could have evolved differently, because they are changeable - the essential ingredient in both environmental activism and the struggle for social justice. Human-centeredness is not necessarily chauvinistic - and if it is, even those who have benefited from it will ultimately come to pay the price that so many others have paid already, namely, in the ecocide that continuing environmental abuse will generate. Coming then, as Ludwig Wittgenstein might have put it, to a more perspicuous understanding of the role of anthropomorphizing language in our "forms of life" supplies us with a key tool toward developing the only conscience that stands any hope of delivering us to a future for human consciousness, that is, a future centered on the responsibility only human beings can take (1953, para.19). NOTES 1. An excellent example of the global nature of this concern is epitomized in the debut of the cyberspace conference, Eco-Res: From Anthropocentrism to Ecocentrism: Making the Shift. Including over 700 participants, and eight- een expert panelists from at least eighty countries, the conference spanned two full weeks of intense discussion from April 14-30, 2007. I would like to thank participants Tony Knight, Ronnie Hawkins, Mary Leysei; Robert Kirkwood, Fred Bender, Ralph Acampora, and Mary Lou Finlay for their insightful remarks, and I would like to thank Ted Mosquin and Patrick Curry for helping me to sharpen and clarify my arguments. See: http://www.eco-res .org/shift_econf.html. 2. There is considerable debate among environmental philosophers about how we ought to refer to human-centeredness. I, for example, have argued else- 48 ETHldT&lt;&amp;^^ 14(1) 2009</page><page sequence="21">where that we make a fundamental mistake when we refer to anthropocen- trism as if it meant the same thing as human chauvinism. I think that it does not, and that we would do the cause of environmental conservation and res- toration a service by reclaiming and revaluing "anthropocentrism" to refer to a human-centeredness after the fashion I have argued here. However, as this debate is not the focus of the present paper, I have opted to refer simply to u human-centeredness " throughout. For my argument concerning this recla- mation, please see Lee 2006, 2007, 2008a, and 2008b. 3. For an example of a related argument about the situatedness of self-referen- tial terms such as "I," please see Lee 1992. 4. For a rather different, but still phenomenologically oriented approach to Nagel's anti-reductionism, see Lee 1992. 5. For a related version of this criticism, see Lee 1998. 6. Among these issues are included, for example, the view that ecofeminists prioritize issues of economic justice at the expense of the possible environ- mental repercussions of economic initiatives. Another is the criticism, leveled by ecofeminists, that measures advocated by at least some deep ecologists (for example Sessions (1995) and Fox (1995)) to control human population growth are implicitly if not explicitly oppressive and infringe upon women's right to reproductive freedom. For a fuller account see Cuomo 1994. While, it must be said, increasing human population certainly is a serious issue, my view is that it cannot be usefully addressed outside the many other issues to which it is intimately connected, for example, nonhuman species habitat loss, global climate change and its effects of migration patterns of human and nonhuman populations, the end of cheap oil, war, the fact that some - prima- rily Western - nations are now experiencing negative population growth, the effects of genetic engineering on food production, and the perennial issue of the availability versus the distribution of food stuffs, just to name a few. 7. Many ecofeminists have, of course, contributed to demonstrating these con- nections. Just a few of these include Karen J. Warren, Val Plumwood, Greta Gaard, Vandana Shiva, Ronnie Hawkins, and Carol Adams. My aim is to tether this valuable work directly to a human-centeredness that offers a po- tentially more vibrant and cooperative platform to the political activism that ideally accompanies these excellent critiques. 8.
