<plain_text><page sequence="1">Examples in Theory: Interpassive Illustrations and Celluloid Fetishism Boaz Hagin Abstract: This essay examines some of the uses of examples from films in theoreti cal writing. Employing Zizek's concept of interpassivity, it argues that the use of examples need not be limited to illustrating a preexistent theory that is already be lieved to be true. Bad Examples. In this article, I offer an account of one of the uses of examples from films in theoretical writing. There are cases when the use of films as exam ples raises no questions. If my theory is about cinematic texts, then giving exam ples from such texts seems obvious. If I claim that some films in the 1930s were in black and white, and give several such films as an example, this makes perfect sense. In other cases, however, the claim is not about cinematic texts, but rather about extra-cinematic reality, or film viewing, and involves a theoretical discussion derived, for example, from gender studies, postcolonial theory, literary criticism, psycho- or schizo-analysis, or cognitive psychology. In these cases, we might say that the theory is "applied" to the film, that we are shown how this theory works within the universe of the cinematic text. In David Bordwell's terms, this is a map ping of semantic fields onto cues identified in the film. The theory's role, accord ing to Bordwell, is to make this mapping more acceptable by the standards of certain prevalent conventions in the academic establishment.' But while it might be clear how reference to a fashionable theory could serve as an excuse in the analysis of a film, does a theoretical discussion require examples from films as well? One option is to assume that films "reflect" reality in some sense (for exam ple, that they are "symptomatic," that they promulgate the dominant ideology, or that they share the collective unconscious). We could then consider the use of films as a way to discuss reality, that with which the particular theory deals, albeit by means of a curious and sometimes inefficient detour. I would like, however, to suggest that there might be an additional component-one that is not very rational and perhaps even disavowed-in our Boaz Hagin teaches at the Film and Television Department at Tel Aviv University. He is a doctoral candidate at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas and the Shirley and Leslie Porter School of Cultural Studies at Tel Aviv University and is writing his dissertation on death in motion pictures.

I begin with Slavoj Zizek's work and his use of ex amples from films. The relationship between his prolific writing and cinema is prob lematic and unclear. At first blush, it seems that films, and more generally popular culture and art, are no more than mere parasitic ornaments to his (or Lacan's) more serious philosophical work, which is assumed by him to be true and to exist prior to and independently of the examples. As Todd McGowan notes, Zizek has been criticized for employing cinematic texts merely as "a source for fecund examples that demonstrate the truths of Lacanian theory."2 Robert Bird suggests that Zizek's use of East European films might be suspected of being no more than "a running illustration of Lacanian metaphysics."3 David Bordwell, who is highly critical of Zizek's style and ideas,4 also agrees that the examples do not make the theoretical claims any more cogent, that ontology and epistemology are "not argued for but rather illustrated."5 While additional uses of examples in Zizek's writing have been discussed for example, by Terry Eagleton and Tim Dean6-I would like to focus on the more common claim that Zizek uses examples from popular culture to illustrate fully formulated theoretical notions by Lacan or others.7 This, at least, is the interpre tation that Judith Butler gives in the book she coauthored with Zizek and Laclau. She contends that Zizek's work functions in a mode "that presumes the separabil ity of the illustrative examples from the content it seeks to illuminate."8 Does he not use, she asks, an "instance of popular culture" in order to illustrate a point "which is, as it were, already true, prior to its exemplification"?9 Zizek himself sim ilarly declares in the introduction to one of his books that it is an attempt to intro duce Jacques Lacan "via Hollywood cinema"'l and in the preface to another that it "exploits popular culture" in order to explain the "Lacanian theoretical edifice."" In the book Enjoy Your Symptom! he insists that the subtitle, Jacques Lacan in Hollywood and Out, should not be taken ironically, since there indeed are two di visions in each chapter. In the first, the Lacanian notion is explained "by way of ex amples from Hollywood"; in the second division of each chapter, the same notion is elaborated outside of Hollywood, "as it is 'in itself,' in its inherent content."'12 The real issue, then, is the theory; it is clearly segregated from the examples, and it can exist independently without them. This claim, that Zizek simply uses cinematic examples as illustrations of a preexistent and true theory, still does not explain why he does so. It might be suggested that they serve to give concrete instances so as to make a general state ment easier to understand. The philosophical discussion includes abstract uni versal claims, whereas the examples offer particular cases that demonstrate these universalities. Since the truth of the statement has already been established (or simply assumed), these examples need not be from reality and thus can, if they help to make things clearer, be taken from fiction films. Are the filmic examples thus indeed concrete particulars that help us to better understand an abstract univer sal proposition that Zizek already believes to be true? 4 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="3">There are two difficulties with this explanation: it does not fit our experience as readers, and it contradicts Zizek's theory. Anyone who has ever struggled to un derstand what Zizek means knows how easy it is to get lost in the barrage of illus trations. They do not make his argument any simpler or clearer. His work, as Rex Butler notes, is "endlessly shifting, open-ended, refuses to close itself down or draw conclusions." In his public performances, Zizek is "constantly circling back upon himself ... threatening never to stop. We feel that he is making the same point over and over again, but we cannot quite grasp it."''3 The second difficulty is that Zizek's theoretical understanding of the relation ship between the universal and the particular should not lead us to expect that examples will simply be concrete instances of already established truths. He fre quently refers to cases in which "far from simply exemplifying the universality to which it belongs, the particular entertains an antagonistic relationship towards it."''4 There is, he repeatedly asserts, a negative relation, "a structural tension,"''5 be tween particulars and the universal, between examples and the proposition of which they are examples. In Zizek's writing, a single case is frequently not a simple illus tration of a universal truth that supposedly precedes it. Hegel's "example," according to Zizek, is a particular that subverts the uni versal.'6 Hegel's notion of "State," he writes, "enters into a negative relationship towards particular, actually existing states," which are its "examples."'7 In the "ex emplification" in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, the examples should not be re duced "to an imperfect illustration of the Idea" since they "paradoxically, subvert the very Idea they exemplify."" Are they thus simply bad examples? According to Hegel's "concrete universality" as understood by Zizek, universality is predeter mined by part of its content. Each particular asserts its own mode of universality and therefore contaminates the universality and the rest of the particulars that be long to that universality. Thus, the universality "religion" is a different universality for followers of different particular religions. Each involves its own universal no tion of what religion "as such" is as well as its own view on how it differs from other religions. Muslims and Christians disagree about their very disagreement. Similarly, the very political opposition between left and right appears in a different view when perceived from the left or perceived from the right. Therefore, the passage from one particular to another is a process that also transforms the encompassing universality.'9 An example could thus alter whatever it supposedly illustrates; the supposed "truth" is neither preexistent nor segregated from its examples. Moreover, the exact relationship between the particular and the universal is not constant. Each particular might illustrate, subvert, struggle with, or displace its universal in its own way; each particular has its own relationship with its uni versality. The "great art of dialectical analysis," Zizek writes, "consists in being able to pick out the exceptional singular case which allows us to formulate the uni versality 'as such.' "20 The "properly dialectical procedure" is a direct leap from this exceptional singular to the universal, a "mix of a special case and sweeping Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 5</page><page sequence="4">generalizations."2' In Freud's case analyses, he directly jumps from a singular case to a universal assertion, from the case study of the "Wolf Man" or from the fantasy "A child is being beaten," to what fantasy or masochism "as such" is. Marx was able to articulate the universal logic of the historical development of humanity by analyzing capitalism, because this monstrous contingent "freak of history" is the "'truth' of the entire previous 'normal' history."22 In short, a singular case is not just an illustration of a theory that has already been elaborated, but is exactly what al lows the direct formulation of that theory, a leap to the universal "as such." Finally, Zizek frequently mentions a universal that depends on an exception, a primordial foreclosure, an exclusion that grounds this universal. He maintains that in "the masculine symbolic economy," there is "one paradoxical Particular" that "immediately gives body to the Universal as such, and simultaneously negates its constitutive feature," hence it is a "Universal grounded in an Exception."23 He explains that in Lacan's logic, it is only the constitutive exception that introduces existence. To pass from the universal proposition to existence, we need an addi tional proposition stating not that at least one particular of the universal exists, but rather that an exception to the universality exists. For the proposition "I love you all" to actually exist, it requires the proposition "there is at least one whom I hate." This is "abundantly confirmed by the fact that universal love for humanity always led to the brutal hatred of the (actually existing) exception, of the enemies of humanity."24 If films are "examples" or "particulars" in one or more of the above senses, they should not, according to Zizek's theory, serve as illustrations that make the universal propositions whose truth has already been established easier to under stand by offering concrete instances of them, although this is sometimes what he claims to do, as well as the way in which they are frequently understood. This is one of the difficulties that Judith Butler finds in his work. Zizek, she writes, con curs with Hegel's critique of Kant's "formalism," the claim that we cannot first identify exterual structures and then apply them to their examples. Yet, in Zizek's use of examples from popular culture, this is exactly what he does: the theory "is articulated on its self-sufficiency, and then shifts register only for the pedagogical purpose of illustrating an already accomplished truth."25 We do not yet seem to be in any better position to understand Zizek's use of examples from films, but one way out of the conundrum might be to rethink the claim that films illustrate a theory that precedes them and is true. What do we mean when we say that we believe a theory to be true? Truth is conventionally un derstood within the logic of "representation" as an agreement of a proposition with a certain state of things in reality, that is, as an adequation between a representa tion and what it represents.26 A theory is true for us, then, if we believe that its propositions are in agreement with the state of things, with reality. If this were the case, Butler's critique of Zizek would no doubt be correct. One way to think otherwise within film theory was offered by Gilles Deleuze. At the very end of his second cinema book, he specifies that film theory, or at least, 6 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="5">"philosophical theory," is the practice of producing "the concepts that cinema gives rise to." Theory, or philosophy, he states clearly, is made, it is not preexis tent; the concepts of cinema need to be produced. Cinema is a new practice of im ages and signs; and its theory, a new philosophical practice of concepts, needs to be created.27 This practice of concepts arising from cinema is not judged by its truthful ness, that is, by some agreement with a state of things in reality. Such an agree ment would have implied that the theory already somehow existed, "ready-made in a prefabricated sky,"28 like Plato's Forms, and merely awaited adequate repre sentation. "For the world to be true, or to be subject to a truthful description," as D. N. Rodowick explains referring to Deleuze's discussion of Nietzsche, "it would have to be static and unchanging."29 Philosophical film theory for Deleuze, by con trast, is a practice that is still being made; it produces the concepts of cinema. An agreement with a preexisting state of things is foreign to Deleuze's lionizing of life, difference, creativity, and becoming. It would stymie the creation of new concepts that "arise" out of the new practice of cinema. But, while this might explain Deleuze's work, it is not clearly part of Zizek's concern. In fact, he writes that he does not necessarily share "the preference of difference over sameness, for historical change over order, . . . [or] for vital dynam ics over rigid schemes."30 For Zizek, the problem with the conventional notion of truth is not that the theorist who seeks truth will refrain from the creative produc tion of new concepts, but that believing a theory to be true is more complex than maintaining that an agreement exists between a proposition and reality. For Zizek, belief is "interpassive" or external; it is a matter of disavowal and fetishism. As we will shortly see, we might therefore very well come to believe as true a theory that we know is false when another person or thing is also involved; and it is here that examples could be employed. Furthermore, I will argue that this "in terpassive" use of examples could lead, in its own way, to creativity, to change and becoming. The Guts of the Machine. I have suggested that Zizek's concept of "interpassiv ity," which is related to disavowal and fetishism, might help us to understand his use of examples. Fetishism and disavowal are not new terms in film theory, but like his general use of Lacan, Zizek's interpretation is fundamentally different in a way that merits careful examination. The terms were used in the psychoanalytically in spired works of the 1970s, including Laura Mulvey's seminal "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema'"31 and discussions of the paradox of fiction ("suspension of dis belief"), the fact that viewers somehow "believed" the movie they were watching, without confusing it with reality fully or for long.32 The theoretical work of the 1970s, as Mulvey notes, "united to challenge the credibility of the Hollywood illu sion," and included strands of anti-fetishism that aimed to exorcise cinema's invest ment in the "willing suspension of disbelief and denial of its own materiality" and "the erasure of labour processes in the society of the spectacle."33 It frequently Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 7</page><page sequence="6">focused, in other words, on exposing illuisions and disavowals, promoting the truth by seeking modernist cinematic alternatives to and remedies for the pernicious fetishistic effects of mainstream films. But fetishism and disavowal can be under stood differently. Octave Mannoni's oft-quoted essay "Je sais bien, mais quand meme . .. has usually been interpreted as extending Freud's account of fetishism. Zizek's analy sis and use of Mannoni, however, shows how Mannoni works in an utterly un Freudian framework, reaching very different conclusions that might eventually offer us a way to understand the use of examples in theory. Mannoni's essay is a discussion of the interrelated concepts of belief (croyance) and disavowal (the Freudian term Verleugnung).3' The typical formula of disavowal in therapy, ac cording to Mannoni, is "I know very well ... but all the same."36 The fetishist, how ever, does not use this formula. For him, it is the fetish itself that takes over the role of "but all the same."37 We are therefore dealing with two distinct cases of disavowal-belief and fetishism. 1. Belief. Most of the examples Mannoni gives of non-fetishist disavowal, or be lief, involve someone else, a credulous or gullible one. Those who believe that Santa Claus exists or that the tribal masks are spirits know very well that this is not so, but they must think that someone else-it could be a child, a wife, an ances tor in the old days -does think so, or at the very least that such a gullible person might exist.38 As Slavoj Zizek explains, the moment of belief "is displaced, pro jected into the other, into the simpleton," whose credulity is necessary for the ma nipulator who "knows very well."39 Belief, he argues, is external; "it is never me who, in the first person singular, is ready to assume belief"; there is always some one else, a subject supposed to believe, who is necessary.40 2. Fetishism. According to Mannoni, this other who is supposed to believe does not exist in the case of disavowal by means of fetishism. The fetishist "does not look for any credulous one; for him, others are ignorant and he leaves them that way."'4' As Freud argues, this is quite convenient for the fetishist: "The meaning of the fetish is not known to other people, so the fetish is not withheld from him."42 What, then, replaces the credulous one, and how and to what degree is the struc ture of belief maintained? The place of the gullible other "is now held by the fetish itself," writes Mannoni. "If it is absent," he cautions, "disturbances occur."43 Mannoni's enigmatic idea is that a disavowing subject does not directly be lieve but needs someone else to believe, or, at the very least, needs to think that this believing other might exist. Even more strangely, in fetishism, an object can take the place of this believing gullible other. Zizek has frequently returned to this odd idea and generalized it in cases of what he calls "interpassivity," in which "I am active while being passive through another."44 Someone or something else is pas sive for me. Christ, for example, has died for us, his believers, so we could go on living (as the Holy Spirit); or believes for us so we never have to directly believe; 8 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="7">or even doubts for us -suspending his belief on the cross ("Father, why hast thou forsaken me?") so that we can regain our ability to believe while transposing onto the other the nagging doubt.45 A favorite example of his is canned laughter in sitcoms. Zizek takes laughing to be passive consumption, and claims that it is done for us by the television show itself, so that whether or not we enjoyed it, we can say afterwards that "we had a really good time."46 Another example of interpassivity that might be familiar to many film scholars is that of compulsively recording hundreds of movies and stor ing them for viewing in a future that never comes. The "very awareness that the films I love are stored in my video library gives me a profound satisfaction," writes Zizek, "as if the VCR is in a way watching them for me." Assuming that film view ing and enjoyment are passive, Zizek argues that the consumption of films is thus performed for me by an object, a machine. "I can remain actively engaged," he ex plains. "I can continue to work in the evening, while the VCR passively enjoys for me."47 Since Zizek does not give a clear account of what he considers "passive," I shall not attempt to distinguish passive activities from active ones, either. I use the term "interpassivity" to signify any activity (dying, believing, doubting, viewing, having a good time) that is externalized, in other words, done by maintaining that someone else does it. I would like to underline how Mannoni's and Zizek's understanding of dis avowal breaks with traditional Freudian psychoanalysis and therefore differs from the use of the notion in 1970s theory.48 For Freud, disavowal and fetishism involve a childhood belief that is contrary to reality and is nevertheless maintained by a splitting of the ego, which allows the person to simultaneously hold two incompat ible ideas, to acknowledge and to deny reality at the same time-for example, to simultaneously acknowledge and deny the "lack" of penises in women. The ego in these cases comprises a current of disavowal that is ignorant of external reality and a knowing portion that is cognizant of the information it receives.49 The fetish ob ject is a substitute for the absent female penis, determined by the last impression before the boy sees the traumatic absence. It is invested with all the interest for merly directed at that organ, which is extraordinarily increased "because the hor ror of castration has set up a memorial to itself in the creation of this substitute."50 Mannoni's account of disavowal is quite different. For one thing, the belief that is not in agreement with reality is and might always have been external to the subject, and, so, unlike Freud's accounts, there is no necessity for it to have ever been held by the subject in the past, during childhood.51 For Zizek, there is an "original and constitutive" gap in such "externalized" or "objectivized" experi ences. There is, he insists, "no primordial direct self-experience which is then, in a secondary move, 'reified' or objectivized."52 More importantly, Mannoni never posits an internal split in the ego, nor does he require for this any other internal mental division into parts or agencies, not even an unconscious. This is not be cause the gullible other or fetish object allows the ego to remain logical and co herent by externalizing the split. One would be hard pressed to explain how Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 9</page><page sequence="8">maintaining that your VCR enjoys movies for you is logical. Disavowal is irrational and incoherent, but there is no need to split the ego in order to explain it. Belief, according to the Lacanian axioms that Mannoni has adopted, is not unconscious.53 The patient, he writes, is, so to speak, "trop epais," too dense; "there is too much substance [e'paisseur] between consciousness and the unconscious," and so the fetishistic disavowal, the "but all the same," need not take place in the uncon scious.54 There is presumably for Mannoni enough "substance" for incoherence and irrationality in the conscious ego, so that it can, in all its non-synthetic unity,55 execute the irrational process and even remain fully aware of it. There is no need for repression or a second current within a split ego. Everything, in Mannoni's ac count, "happens in full light."56 While adding a reference to Mannoni, and especially to the title of his essay, has become something of a knee-jerk reaction whenever the terms "fetish" or "dis avowal" are used in the humanities, his break with Freud is not always noted, and the interpretation given to his essay differs significantly from Zizek's reading of belief as external. Thus, 1970s theory with its anti-fetishism agenda assumes Mannoni and Freud are perfectly compatible and easily shifts between them. The fifth chapter of the first part of Metz's The Imaginary Signifier, for example, is ti tled "Disavowal, Fetishism," and refers in detail to Mannoni. When discussing the problem of belief in the cinema, Metz notes that the audience is not duped and knows that the screen presents no more than a fiction; yet, at the same time, it is important that this make-believe be scrupulously respected. "Any spectator," he writes, "will tell you that he 'doesn't believe it,' but everything happens as if there were nonetheless someone to be deceived, someone who really would 'believe in it."' Yet this gullible someone is not external as s/he would be, according to Zizek's reading of Mannoni. Metz refers to Mannoni, but then returns to the Freudian ac count by claiming that the disavowed belief takes place "somewhere in oneself"; the credulous person is "another part of ourselves," seated "beneath the incredu lous one, or in his heart."57 Perhaps the most important difference between Metz's and Zizek's under standing of Mannoni, certainly for my attempt to employ it in order to explain the use of examples, is the hope of attaining knowledge, of using or overcoming the false belief structure in order to reach the truth. For Metz, the cinematic fetish is the technical film equipment.58 Like the Freudian fetish that is used to recuper ate after traumatically encountering the "castrated" woman, the ensemble of equip ment and its tricks, Metz claims, cover the lack or wound of cinema (the fact that the object is absent and replaced by its reflection), so that the cinema can become desirable again without excessive fear. But this fetish structure can also be used to reach the truth. Metz recalls that the fetish is evidence not of a simple false belief, but that reality has been both recorded and disavowed-that is, that the fetish also has knowledge value. The theoretician of the cinema can therefore make a li bidinal investment not in the "but all the same" of Mannoni's formula, but in the 1 0 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="9">"I know very well."59 While the regular role of the fetish would be to cover the lack, for the theorist, it seems to have the potential of overcoming this. He even imagines his own inquiry as putting an end to the fetishistic love of the cinema, at least in this form. The theoretician who discloses the (ideological) operation of the apparatus is like the connoisseur "who wants to break open the toy and see into the guts of the machine,"60 a person who is "necessarily sadistic."'6' The study of the cinema thus breaks the toy and loses it, but, in compensation, gains knowledge and changes the stress in the structure of fetishism so as to rediscover the truth that is, to prevent or reduce the ideological functioning of the apparatus. Unlike Metz, for Zizek, the conclusion from Mannoni's work is that this ges ture of unmasking a false ideology is completely futile. Ideology works not because we believe in it, but because we believe someone else does, because belief is ex ternal, interpassive. Ideology works no less if we maintain a cynical position, never really believe in dominant slogans or ideas, are fully aware of reality, of the eco nomic and material interests that are at stake, and of the inequality inherent in common sense." It makes no difference as long as we act according to the very belief that we do not believe in. Domination might take this distance into account and even solicit it.62 "The fundamental level of ideology," Zizek writes, "is not of an illusion masking the real state of things."63 In East European "real socialism," for ex ample, the system was aimed at maintaining the semblance of a united people sup porting the Party and Socialism, "ritualized spectacles followed one after another in which nobody 'really believed' and everybody knew that nobody believed."64 It was enough that the subjects who never "really believed" nevertheless "acted as if they believed, as if the Party ruled with full legitimacy, they followed the 'external' ritual, made the proper acclamations when it was necessary, etc." No one "really" believed, just acted as if they did, for the sake of an ideological "big Other" that functioned as the "subject supposed not to know," the agency for whose gaze everything is staged.65 Fascism, he writes, "feigns" or "stages" its power in theatri cal simulation, but we must insist on the "thoroughly 'serious' character of such feigning." The madness of fascism lies not in people believing in such rituals, but in the inner distance. The subject does not believe, but simulates, externally imi tates, such beliefs.66 Since belief is interpassive, debunking falsehoods, becoming aware and cyn ical, increasing the libidinal investment in the "I know very well," or breaking open the toy to see into the guts of the machine will have no effect. We already know. It makes no difference because it is not me (or a part of me) that naively believes; it is always someone else, or something, or the stupid subject supposed not to know, the big Other. For Metz and Zizek, foregrounding the apparatus will therefore have oppo site effects on the fetishistic belief. Mannoni argues that disturbances occur if the fetish is absent. Zizek gives an example in which the denial of the death of a loved one is performed interpassively, by a fetish. A man confronts reality head on, while Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 1 1</page><page sequence="10">allowing the fetish to do the denying in his place. Once the fetish is absent, how ever, the interpassive denial comes to an end, resulting in crisis: In the sad case of a friend of miiine wlhose wife died of breast cancer, this fetish was a hamster, the wife's most beloved pet animal. He was able to talk in a cold way about his wife's painful dying, while holding on his lap the hamster, the embodied disavowal of the wife's death. When, half a year later, the hamster died, the friend of mine to tally collapsed and had to be hospitalized for a suicidal depression.67 Metz, in contrast, believes that it is not the absence of fetish, but rather the affirmation of its presence, that could bring the fetishistic belief to an end. As Mulvey explains, in 1970s theory and counter-cinema, there was "an aspiration towards the defetishisation of the film medium ,"68 which involved exorcising the denial of the cinema's own materiality, foregrounding the apparatus. Following Mannoni's and Zizek's account, however, if the apparatus itself is the fetish, then its existence, or at least the possibility of its existence, is crucial for our interpas sive belief in films. To stop fetishistic belief, we would therefore need to kill the hamster, get rid of the apparatus, rather than reveal its presence. Such elimination of the apparatus occurred not in 1970s counter-cinema, but with the advent of digital technology in the late 1980s and 1990s. Many argued that the digital (or post-photographic) image challenged the traditional indexical ity to which cinema's nineteenth-century technologies were still bound.69 Some scholars, however, knew very well that there was really no fundamental rupture be tween photography and so-called post-photography. The novelty, as Philip Rosen noted, was said to be "the simple presence or absence of manipulability per se" or "of indexicality per se," but both could be present or absent both in "old" and in "new" technologies.70 Many, as Maureen Turim observed, argued that nothing had been lost but "an unfortunate naive belief in photographic recording of reality,' but film and photography scholars had in any case been questioning this belief for decades. The loss of the photochemical Victorian photographic apparatus, if it was at all a loss, should not have made such belief any more or any less justified; yet oddly enough, for some people, it apparently did. Looking at the problem through interpassivity, we could say that the crisis came about not because we stopped believing (we never had believed), but because the apparatus, the gullible other that believed for us, had become redundant in the age of digital artifacts. The crisis resulted from the death of the fetish-hamster. Foregrounding the apparatus, according to an interpassive account, would not dis able belief; rather, it would be tantamount to putting the hamster on the viewer's lap, enabling the disavowal. Thus, Fight Club (David Fincher, 1999) ends with a digital composite showing the unnamed narrator holding the hand of his girlfriend and looking out of the window at a computer-generated view of explosives deto nating and skyscrapers collapsing.72 The film we are viewing appears to jam in the projector, a few frames from a supposedly pornographic film are spliced in, and then the film continues. We never need to believe that the imploding skyscrapers, the digitally simulated spectacular climax of the film, is "real" as it might have been 12 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="11">Figure 1. "Tyler" splices single frames of pornography into family films and points at the "cigarette burn" that cues the projectionist to change reels in Fight Club (Twentieth Century Fox, 1999). While the film makes use of virtual computer generated imagery, it also draws our attention to the possible presence, at least in projection and guerilla editing, of the outdated celluloid cinematic apparatus, the reassuring interpassive fetish that does the believing for us. before digital artifacts entered the scene. We just need to become aware of the guts of the machine, our hamster, the film that jams in the projector. It does not matter whether we still believe or not, in fact if we ever did, because our fe tish will believe for us. The film just needs to show us that the hamster is still alive, that somewhere in the process of making and projecting films, the outdated nineteenth-century cinematic apparatus could still be there. Believing and Seeing. Let us now return to the problem we began with: the role of examples in theory. Zizek has claimed that he uses films and popular cul ture only as a source of examples, but as we have seen, this does not agree with his own theory of examples and illustrations as, for example, subverting the universal that they supposedly illustrate. With interpassivity, we might be able to consider the problem differently. Let us look at an example. In the conclusion to his chapter on the viewer's ac tivity,73 in a section called "Believing and Seeing," David Bordwell discusses Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). Why does he do so? He gives several reasons for choosing this example, such as tradition, when he states that Rear Window "has long been used as a small-scale model of the spectator's activity." Moreover, the analogy between the situation in the film and film viewing is, according to Bordwell, no less than "irresistible,"74 so this tradition seems merely to be giving in to an overpowering temptation that the film possesses. Even if Bordwell's reasons for choosing Rear Window were convincing, we still do not know why he turns to fiction cinema at all. What difference does it make to his argument? One option is that it makes his abstract propositions clearer Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 13</page><page sequence="12">by means of an example. His theory of the viewer's Constructivist perceptual cognitive activity up to this point has been abstract and general ("the formal con ditions under which we comprehend a film"), 5 so perhaps it makes perfect sense now to give a specific and concrete example. He certainly does so: his theory is that films include cues that encourage and constrain the viewer's activity, and his example now discerns such cues in Rear Window and explains how they prompt the viewer's activity. Thus, at one point, he describes a certain camera movement that only gradually discloses information, explaining that "Rear Window perfectly illustrates" Sternberg's claim about narrative retardation.76 At another point, he ar gues that near the end of the film, the "viewer is in that situation of classic sus pense astutely described by Nod Carroll."77 Bordwell persistently claims nonetheless that the example of Rear Window is much more than an instance of a film that includes cues to encourage viewer activ ity, as "[e]very fiction film does."78 The protagonist's action, according to Bordwell, "displays quite beautifully the activity of the film spectator."79 The film, he claims, is "extraordinary in the explicitness with which [the viewer's] tasks are spelled out"; it "lays bare" the way we typically construct stories; the film can be used "to ex hibit" the full complexity of the viewing activity.80 In other words, he is not just using the film to demonstrate his theory, but claims that the film in itself somehow already demonstrates it. This is quite puzzling. Not only is it unclear whether the film indeed exhibits the film viewer's activity, since, as Bordwell notes, the protagonist's "inferential process does not completely mirror our own,"'8' but, more importantly, Rear Win dow is not explicitly about film viewing at all. At most, it is analogous to film view ing. In fact, countless film theorists before Bordwell who have been exposed to the movie have not deduced the same theory that appears in the chapter; some per haps have even mustered the strength to resist the very analogy with film view ing. It is David Bordwell who spells it out, not Rear Window. In the same chapter, Bordwell argues that film viewing is not "reading" proper, a word that should only be applied to "the abstract propositional arguments characteristic of critical analy sis and interpretation."82 Does he now claim that the viewer's activity is in fact that of deducing abstract propositional arguments indeed, a theory of spectatorship? Is his interpretation of Rear Window as laying bare the viewer's activity not a rare result of one specific viewer's prior knowledge happening to include a certain Con structivist perceptual-cognitive theory of film viewing? And, is this not as idiosyn cratic as, say, Zizek's coming to the film with Lacanian schemata? Does it not, in fact, subvert his hypothetical hollow "spectator" who merely executes the viewing protocols described in the book,83 which do not include extracting the knowledge that is discussed in the book? I would like to suggest that the notion of interpassivity could help us make sense of this use of examples or illustrations by Bordwell, Zizek, and many others. In a self-interview, Zizek mentions to himself his obsession with providing exam ples from the domain of popular culture. His reaction to his observation is that in 1 4 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="13">the Lacanian procedure, he can say that he has gained access to the truth about his desire when he can formulate the truth in such a way that he can pass it on to two passeurs, two idiots, who in turn are able to transmit it intact to the comite' de la passe. He claims that an example from popular culture has the same functional role: "I am convinced of my proper grasp of some Lacanian concept only when I can translate it successfully into the inherent imbecility of popular culture." This oft-quoted sentence should not be misunderstood. Zizek does not consider exam ples as merely a way to test his own understanding of Lacan. It is, he states clearly, an "externalization in an imbecilic medium."84 In other words, it is an interpassive way for Zizek to become confident of his own understanding. Thus, in a way, we should believe him when he says that he exploits popular culture so as to explain Lacanian notions. The point we should add, however, is that this is not necessarily in order to clarify things for himself, nor to make others understand them; it is not, as Butler assumes, for a pedagogical purpose, but interpassively, in order to exter nalize this understanding. Could it be that the role of examples, both for the authors and their recipi ents, is indeed interpassive? What such illustrations do is externalize the belief in the proposition they want us to accept. It is no longer the readers following the words of the author who are expected to understand the theory, evaluate it, and, so the author presumably hopes, accept it. Rather, Bordwell now asks his readers to acknowledge that the film itself displays, explicitly spells out, lays bare, or ex hibits the theory being offered to us. It is not the author or the reader but the film that holds and expresses the theoretical propositions. In Zizek's anthropomorphic terms, if canned laughter on the sound track can have a good time, and a VCR can enjoy a film, then surely films can understand a theory, assess it, and decide to ac cept and exhibit it. In many scholarly works, it seems that the "application" of theory to a film somehow increases the truth of that theory. The world of the fiction film is not re ality, and showing that a theory about reality is in accordance with a film proves nothing about the theory's adequacy to reality (unless we assume in addition that the film or cinema in general are "realistic" in this sense). Rather, what these ex amples or illustrations do is set up the structure of belief as described by Mannoni; they externalize the discussion onto the film and unburden us of the need to eval uate it. It is not I who needs to believe Bordwell's account, accept or reject the the ory; it is someone or something else, a film, perhaps Rear Window.85 I have suggested that Zizek's concept of interpassivity might help us to ac count for one aspect of the structure and logic of using examples in theory: the examples interpassively confirm the theory for us. I have given, as examples, the use of examples by Zizek and Bordwell. These theoretical texts are, in one aspect, particular cases that demonstrate my universal claim. But more interestingly, within the logic of interpassivity, they could also be taken as interpassively con firming that claim, enabling us to believe it is true because we believe that Zizek and Bordwell or their texts believe so.86 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 15</page><page sequence="14">In fact, at the price of circularity, we could even interpassively confirm inter passivity in general by finding examples that will exhibit interpassivity and so believe in Zizek's theory for us.87 We do not need to directly believe that interpassivity is true at all. We might find the whole idea of interpassivity false and even quite silly. VCRs do not enjoy movies, and movies do not evaluate theories. The point is, if we follow Zizek, that in order to interpassively establish our belief in interpassiv ity, it need not be true or convince us; it simply needs to be believed externally. What we need, in short, are more examples. Films that deal with the super natural might be particularly helpful in interpassively confirming interpassive be lief because they ask their characters to believe in something while knowing very well that, according to their beliefs, it should not exist. We are not, therefore, deal ing with a fictional universe in which what we take to be supernatural is consid ered natural and arouses no dismay in the characters - Noel Carroll's "fairy tale"88 or Tzvetan Todorov's form of "the marvelous."89 Rather, we are looking for those cases in which something that the characters find difficult to believe does take place (or maybe takes place), what Carroll would define as "horror" and Todorov calls "the fantastic." It is there that the issue of belief is explicitly raised. Indeed, if we take the two schematic plot structures that Carroll identifies in many horror stories, we will see that convincing other people of one's belief is a characteristic part of the recur ring plots. In the first abstract structure, which Carroll dubs the complex discov ery plot, after an individual or a group discovers the monster's existence, "this information is treated skeptically by certain third parties, often authority figures such as the police, eminent scientists, religious leaders, government officials, or the army."90 The plot movement of discovery is therefore followed by the plot movement of confirmation, with "the discoverers of or the believers in the exis tence of the monster convincing some other group of the existence of the creature and of the proportions of the mortal danger at hand."9' In the second abstract structure, that of the overreacher (e.g., a mad scientist), there is no structural plot movement of convincing others. However, here too, the overreacher typically en gages in explanation and justification of his work, and so "conveniently has an as sistant or a friend or some other interlocutor" as well as family, friends, and love relations to whom he can also declaim his justification.92 This need to obtain the belief and consent of others, to maintain an interpassive structure, is quite appar ent in films in which it seems to serve no clear interest of any character. In The Others (Alejandro Amenabar, 2001) a mother (who disavows the fact that she and her children are ghosts) spends most of the film making sure that the rest of the characters in the film-her children and the servants (they are also ghosts, but fully aware of it) -behave as if they ascribe to her beliefs: that they are alive, that there are no intruders in the house (the living who have moved in), and that her Catholic belief in Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory is true. Much of the film is spent extracting opinions and confessions, reprimanding, teaching, and explain ing to the children and servants the only truth the mother is willing to hear. What 16 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="15">is quite clear is that no one, probably not even the mother, directly believes any of it; they just pretend for her sake, and do not even bother hiding this fact from her. In a similar and earlier film, The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan, 1999), a dis turbed boy insists that he can be helped only if the child psychologist treating him (who is a ghost disavowing his own death) believes his assertion that he can see dead people. Appropriately enough, he tries to convince him of this in a church. The child psychologist, in turn, can only disavow his death by maintaining that others still believe he is alive and limiting his experiences to such rare and ambigu ous situations.93 As to interpassivity as fetishism-that is, as an object, not a person, that be lieves for us-in The Polar Express (Robert Zemeckis, 2004), the protagonist, a young boy, is not certain whether Santa is for real or not, not certain whether he still believes. The boy tries various options to establish or disprove his belief in the existence of Santa-from looking up the North Pole in an encyclopedia to closing his eyes and saying "I believe." He even gets to meet Santa, who does not affirm that he does indeed exist, but rather tells him that he, Santa, is a symbol of the spirit of Christmas that truly lies in the boy's heart. After all these options, ulti mately, it is the sound of a bell from Santa's sleigh that indicates to him and all others whether they believe or not. At the end of the film, the bell rings for him and his little sister, since both still believe. It remains silent when his parents try to ring it and they say it is broken. The narrator in voice-over even tells us that the bell still rings for all who truly believe. It is the fetish object, the bell, that believes for him; when it breaks and stops ringing, belief comes to a stop. What these films as examples thus do, interpassively, for us as viewers, is to consider several options of what "belief" could mean and to finally settle on a struc ture similar to the one offered by Mannoni and Zizek: external belief through others who believe or through a fetish object. The concept of interpassivity is in terpassively considered and accepted by these films for us. Children and Monsters. My final example is a film that does not confirm our belief in interpassivity but complicates it, showing the creative potential in re thinking the gullible other. The film introduces the idea that the gullible other might not be as gullible as we think and could be used not only to confirm a the ory, but also to force us to think differently. The external other could supply us with an encounter with what Zizek calls the traumatic Real, which, he explains, "brutally imposes itself on us, shattering our established ways of thinking."94 Within the film, the characters learu that interpassivity that relies on a gullible other does not work; they are forced to think creatively, in a different way. Taking the film itself as an example of interpassivity, therefore, does not confirm a theory of interpassivity that uses the gullible other. Rather, it claims that we need to think differently; it encourages us to reconsider our own beliefs. According to Monsters, Inc. (Pete Docter, David Silverman, Lee Unkrich, 2001), monsters live in their own monster world, are quite amusing, and most of Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 17</page><page sequence="16">them, at least, mean no evil. Not only are they harmless to children, they are in fact terrified of them and are taught that children are toxic and fatal. What, then, makes monsters monstrous? Here the film seems to offer a structure very similar to interpassivity. The entire city of Monstropolis is fuelled by Monsters, Incorporated (MI), a company that refines the screams of children into clean, dependable energy. It uses specially trained monsters, called "scarers," who venture into the deadly human world through the closet doors in children's bedrooms in order to frighten them into screaming. The company's operation is highly reminiscent of the struc ture of interpassivity: while children are afraid of monsters, the monsters only pre tend they are about to harm them and know very well that they do not intend to hurt or even touch the children (as said, they believe children are toxic). The power of monsters is thus dependent on the credulous child believing in some thing the monsters know is false. Limiting ourselves to these scenes, we could say that the film illustrates interpassivity that depends on a gullible other, that it inter passively confirms the theory of interpassivity. However, the film does not stop here. We are informed quite early on in the film that scaring children into screaming is no longer easy. As a commercial in the film explains, "the window of innocence is shrinking." Kids, complains the com pany's CEO, Mr. Waternoose, just do not get scared these days like they used to. There is, in other words, a shortage of gullible others. Interpassivity is not a reli able source of energy because the behavior of the gullible other might change. Waternoose is concerned with solving the problem of the shrinking window of innocence, the lack of sufficiently gullible others. The company has been in his family for three generations, and it apparently never occurs to him to challenge his own beliefs or the role of children in the production of energy. For him, the essen tial component in producing power is the predictable behavior of the other. He is devoted to preventing any encounter with the "traumatic" Real, such as with a child who is no longer innocent and whose behavior is unpredictable. His employees are taught that the worst mistake they can make is leaving open the door that al lows them to enter children's bedrooms, because it could let a human child into the monster world. In addition, the training of the new scare recruits, with which Waternoose is personally concerned throughout the film, takes place in a simulated bedroom, in which a torso of a mannequin simulates a child. Its only reaction to monsters is apparently to show fear and scream in terror. When, at the beginning of the film, one of the recruits fumbles and, instead of scaring the simulated child, falls and performs a hilarious and involuntary slapstick routine, the simulated child does not start laughing as a real child would. The MI personnel, including its CEO, Waternoose, do not seem interested in this option, if they are aware of it at all. For them, children are useful when they are innocent and can be made to scream in a predictable way. That they might have other reactions is of no interest to them. When the power derived from the interpassive situation becomes unreliable, when innocent children become rare, Waternoose tries to control the behavior of the 18 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="17">gullible other, to turn children into predictable robots like the mannequin in the simulator: he secretly has one of his employees test a new machine that extracts screams from its victims by force. The problem, however, is not only that children are no longer innocent. In the film, monsters also fear children. This symmetry suggests that it is never clear who the gullible other actually is and to what extent any of the participants in the structure is gullible at all. If no one directly believes, but only believes that the other believes, it follows that interpassivity is reversible, that we have no right to assume others directly believe while our own form of belief is interpassive and complex. Zizek warns us not to attribute naYvete to the other, "transforming him or her into a 'subject supposed to believe."' We should be careful not to assume that even "'Muslim fundamentalists'. . . must 'really believe."'95 The external other necessary for interpassivity might not, in fact, be nadve, and maintain a cynical dis tance as well. Could it be that children only pretend to believe in Santa Claus for the sake of their parents, to ensure that the parents believe that the children be lieve? That they are only pretending to be scared, that they scream for the sake of the friendly monsters who derive their energy from their belief that the children are afraid? Perhaps the sophisticated viewers who are suspending their disbelief or being impressed by yet another Pixar-Disney production are not feigning it for the sake of the children, naYve viewers of early cinema, or the apparatus that has taken their place. Perhaps for them, the external others are the well-informed filmmakers, the ones who are impressed by and aware of the immense resources required to render the computer-generated monsters. The viewers might be act ing for the filmmakers' sake, in order to maintain the filmmakers' belief that the viewers believe and are in awe. The film's protagonist, an ace scarer named James P. Sullivan, encounters a real human girl who manages to infiltrate the monster world. For the company's CEO, Waternoose, children are only of interest when screams can be extracted from them-either by scaring them or through a machine. For Sullivan, however, the encounter with the real human girl becomes an opportunity to change his own ways of thinking. He understands that children, at least this one, are not toxic or dangerous. Moreover, it soon becomes clear to him that the girl enjoys scaring the monsters (he even names her Boo) and pretending to disappear while letting him pretend not to be able to find her. She is not as gullible as he thought, and her be liefs are not direct; they include playfulness and pretending. The training simula tor helps him to realize that in interpassivity, his control of the situation is limited because it also depends on an external other who might not behave in the way he thinks it should. When Boo sees him pretend to scare the simulated child, she is terrified. He tries to tell her not to be scared, that it was not real, but is unable to continue his explanation once he sees her terrified reaction followed by his make believe growl on the monitors that had recorded the events in the simulator. See ing his own activity in light of her reaction, interpassively, he can no longer continue claiming that it was not real and ask her not to be scared. His certainty Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 19</page><page sequence="18">Figures 2-4. Sullivan learns about interpassivity in the scare simulator in Mon sters, Inc. (Buena Vista Pictures, 2001). He sees Boo's reaction to his growl, then only his growl, and finally realizes that it does not only depend on him whether his scaring was "real" or not. 20 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="19">in his own beliefs and in the meaning of his acts can no longer be maintained: that children are deadly, that they are innocent and gullible, that energy needs to be produced from their screams, and that the distinction between doing something in a "real" way and only pretending is within his control. Waternoose, however, has managed to avoid any encounters with an unpre dictable other. He is certain he knows whether he directly believes or is only pre tending. Throughout the film, he manages to dupe Sullivan into trusting him and believing that he wants to take the human child back home and is not aware of the secret experiments with the scream-extracting machine for which children need to be kidnapped. At the end of the film, Sullivan lures Waternoose into the simula tor, but acts as if he is in Boo's real bedroom. Believing that others are gullible and not pretending and that the simulator in which children can only scream is equiv alent to a real child's bedroom, Waternoose is unaware that he is in the simulator and not in Boo's bedroom. Believing that only Sullivan can hear him, he confesses his evil plan to kidnap children and silence anyone who gets in the way. He is not aware that he himself is being duped, that he is really in a simulator, and that his admission is being watched by others and recorded. He is arrested and taken away. Unlike Waternoose, Sullivan no longer trusts his own beliefs. As the new CEO, he reinvents MI to work on laughter instead of "scare" and solves the energy crisis. In addition, although he was told that he could no longer see Boo because "that's the way it has to be," at the end of the film, we see him entering the door that transports him from the monster world into her bedroom, thus violating what had appeared to be the most important interdiction of the monster world. He has risked exposure to the toxic presence of a real child who was not gullible and so was able to introduce real change into his beliefs and world-to perform what Zizek would define as a Lacanian "act," the unpredictable madness of doing some thing impossible within the coordinates of the current symbolic so as to change it, an "intervention which redefines the rules and contours of the existing order."96 Instead of trying to extend the gullibility of others, we might learn from Mon sters, Inc. to accept that their faith is not nalve, either, and that perhaps it is our own beliefs that need to be challenged. Allowing the other the same interpassivity that we allow ourselves is thus also an invitation to creativity. At least that is what Monsters, Inc. believes or pretends to believe. As an example, the discussion could be limited to the few scenes that do illustrate interpassivity with a gullible other. However, having found this illustration, we could then continue watching the film and allow that encounter to challenge our initial beliefs, to subvert the universal it is meant to exemplify. To recapitulate, in this article, I have argued that there is an irrational, inter passive component in the use of filmic examples in theoretical writing; that in some cases, examples do not, or do not only, illustrate a claim that is already believed to be true, at least not for Zizek. I have supported my claim, that examples are used in order that they may interpassively believe in the truth of theoretical proposi tions for us, by giving examples from theoretical writings (Bordwell's analysis of Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 21</page><page sequence="20">Rear Window) and have suggested that interpassivity itself could be confirmed in terpassively, by finding examples from films that emphasize the importance of in terpassivity. I have also given examples to show what happens when interpassivity ceases to work, when we can no longer maintain the existence of the fetish object or the credulity of the other. Fight Club managed to foreground the fetish that was in danger of disappearing and thereby to maintain belief. Monsters, Inc., on the other hand, while illustrating interpassivity using a gullible other, also challenges this belief. Its protagonist is willing to allow an encounter with an other who is not gullible and ends up changing the most basic tenets of his world. The film thus in terpassively rethinks the theory of interpassivity for us: it is not only that the pre existent claim that examples illustrate is not already believed to be true; the claim itself might change and not be preexistent.

Another, somewhat convoluted way to under stand this problem is to claim that all of the examples together, if understood more as confusing than actually clarifying anything, could be understood as a particular exam ple of Zizek's universal proposition that there is a structural tension between the uni versal and the particular. However, if the examples are meant to be examples of the argument that examples subvert the argument that they are meant to illustrate, should they or should they not subvert that argument? 26. Cf.

On the other hand, Zizek claims that singularity "explodes the given contours of the universality in question and opens it up to a radically new content" (Organs without Bodies, 15nl9); this explosion, he says, is, or is in, Deleuze s process of becoming (14). We might therefore say that Zizek's exploitation of films, his film "theory," is perhaps more Deleuzian than he would care to admit. This is, in a way, only fair, since in Organs without Bodies, his Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 23</page><page sequence="22">book on Deleuze, which Ian Buchanan describes as "Zizek's worst book" (Ian Buchanan, "Zizek and Deleuze," in Traversing the Fantasy: Critical Responses to Slavoj Zizek, ed. Geoff Boucher, Jason Glynos, and Matthew Sharpe [Aldershot: Ashgate, 2005], 70), Zizek went to great lengths to point out, frequently employing (rhetorical?) questions, ways and places in which Deleuze is "deeply Lacanian" (Organs without Bodies, 48). Zizek states or insinuates that the reality of Deleuze s virtual is the Lacanian Real (3); that his concept of quasi cause is the exact equivalent of Lacan s objet petit a (27); that the Lacanian phallus is precisely the point of non-sense sustaining the flow of sense (28); that when Lacan reads Kant "with Sade" he is taking Kant from behind and giv ing him a monstrous child, thus performing Deleuze s view of the history of philoso phy as a sort of buggery and immaculate conception (48); and that Deleuze s concept of the "plane of consistency" is what Lacan called the "feminine" non-All set (54). Should we not say that Zizek's illustrations from popular culture are a Deleuzian the oretical practice? 31.

If I were forced to give a Freudian precedent for interpassivity, it would be the "third person" in the telling of jokes. Freud states that one does not laugh at one's own jokes but requires a third, or other, person. In jests, it "seems as though . . . the other person has the decision passed over to him on whether the joke-work has succeeded in its task" (Sigmund Freud, Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, S.E. 8:144). 24 Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008</page><page sequence="23">49.

Freud, on the other hand, claims that we take the ego's synthetic function for granted ("Splitting of the Ego," S.E. 23:276), and it therefore becomes necessary to posit its "splitting" in order to explain what happens in fetishism and disavowal. 56. Mannoni, "Je sais bien," 30. 57. Metz, The Imaginary Signifier, 72. Metz has several more examples, but he repeatedly seems to avoid Mannoni's model. When externalizing belief onto a character, for exam ple, he then adds "a partial identification" of the audience with that character (72). Even when invoking the audience of early cinema and their alleged na?ve belief, he im plies that they are not other to, but merely younger versions of, today's viewers who "are no longer children" (73). 58.

The situation in Rear Window is in fact that of viewing several apartments, so the analogy is not very compelling unless one tends to view films by racing from screen to screen at a multiplex. It is probably closer to a Cinema Journal 48, No. 1, Fall 2008 25</page><page sequence="24">television viewer switching channels. Zizek compares it to the multiple screens in Sliver (Phillip Noyce, 1993) or the contingent communication between different stories in some of Robert Altman's films (M?tastases of Enjoyment, 208-10). 75.

Some films, writes Bordwell, are treated by certain critics as "aspiring to the status of written theory or criticism" (Making Meaning, 103); they are granted the power "to in vestigate conceptual issues and reveal truths" (212). 86. This reflexivity on my part is meant to add another example, to set up an additional fetish, to create interpassivity, not to challenge any illusion in an act of anti-fetishism. 87. The circularity results from assuming the theory of interpassivity in order to confirm by means of interpassivity the very theory of interpassivity that we assume. I am not claiming that this is the best way to confirm interpassivity, and I am certainly not claim ing that this is the only way to do so. It is not self-evident that such a confirmation could be successfully performed for every theory of how theories are confirmed. For Zizek, at any rate, such "paradoxes" in which an effect posits its own cause are not a reason for alarm, but rather an inseparable part of the work of Freud, Lacan, and Hegel (see, for example, the second chapter of M?tastases of Enjoyment). 88.

It is never made clear in the film what happens to the disavowing ghost before and after these ambiguous situations or at other times?whether he does not exist, or merely forgets what would otherwise disturb his interpassive belief that he is still alive. 94. Zizek, "Da Capo senza Fine," 213. Zizek is referring here to his own encounter with Butler and Laclau and associates it with Gilles Deleuze's anti-Cartesian thrust, accord ing to which thought never begins spontaneously and is always decentered; we are al ways forced to think. 95.
