Kroell General Motors Research Labs. (Retired) ABSTRACT Seventeen left lateral impact experiments were performed using anesthetized swine to determine the biomechanics of injury production in this impact mode. Two series of eight animals were used and one animal served as a control. In the first series of experiments, rigid thoracic and pelvic loading surfaces were separated by an "Interplate gap" of 20.3 cm (8"). In the second series of experiments, the interplate gap was filled by a rigid plate mounted flush with the thoracic and pelvic loading surfaces. Impact velocities ranged from 7.2 to 15.0 m/s (about 15 to 30 mph). Injury patterns for the liver, spleen, and rib cage were significantly different in the two series of experiments (level of significance &gt; 90%). The causative factor responsible for the different injury outcomes was the interplate gap. The conclusion of this report is that loading-surface discontinuities can cause significant injury. Therefore, in design of side doors and interiors, consideration should be given to the location of surface indentations (such as map pockets) as well as surface protuberances (such as armrests). THE MECHANISMS AND MITIGATION OF INJURY In lateral impacts have been the focus of recent research by the automotive safety community. Much of that research is directed toward improved designs of anthropomorphic test devices. The original intent of this study was to further develop an experimental model for lateral impact Induced injury using whole body sled tests with a porcine surrogate. The present paper describes an analysis of 17 experiments with 2 different loading surfaces. The test environment chosen was similar to that used in the side impact cadaver tests performed at the University of Heidelberg [see 9,10]*, and thus should allow comparison with an existing data base. The results of these experiments highlight the importance of loading * Numbers in brackets indicate references listed at the end of the paper. conditions on side impact injury. They emphasize the need for additional research on side door and interior designs from the standpoint of biomechanical criteria, in addition to the traditional customer acceptance criteria of styling and function. It has been well documented that injury to nearside occupants in lateral impact is primarily a consequence of contact with the side door surface [See for example, 11,15,19]. Similarly, it has been shown [11,17,18,20] that the shape, size, and compliance of the loading area influences the resulting injury. The above mentioned studies report the effects of surface protuberances which cause injury when they are forcefully propelled into the thorax or abdomen. As will be shown, the analysis of the experiments performed in this study indicates that the inverse loading situation can also be injury producing. That is, surfaces with areas into which localized portions of the body can extrude, such as pockets in side doors, are also potentially injurious. These results may become increasingly more significant as side door padding becomes a standard feature on vehicles since many of the proposed schemes suggest incorporation of zones of varying stiffness [5,7,8,12,21,22,23,24] MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen experiments were performed using a single porcine subject in each.* The 1 7 subjects were Landrace- Yorkshlre crossbred males with an average mass of 50.9 ± 5.0 kg (112.0 ± 10.9 lbs). The subjects were pre- anesthetized by intramuscular injection of Acetylpromazine Maleate (0.37 mg/kg) and Ketamine HCl (33 mg/kg). They were then shaved and induced into deep surgical anesthesia by inhalation of Nitrous Oxide (50% for induction, 30% for maintenance) and Methoxyflurane (3% for induction, .75% for maintenance). Depth of anesthesia was assured by monitoring of heart rate, respiration rate and volume, blood pressure, and * See footnote on next page. 1720</page><page sequence="2">neurological reflexes. After surgical anesthesia was achieved via mask inhalation, a tracheostomy was performed and an endotracheal tube inserted to provide closed circuit anesthesia. A respiration rate sensor was attached to the endotracheal tube, and ECG leads were connected to the subject to monitor lead II. A Millar® pressure transducer was inserted into the right carotid artery and advanced to a position approximately one inch above the aortic valve in the arch of the aorta. Next, the subject was instrumented with accelerometers and photographic targets as follows: A uniaxial accelerometer was placed In the intercostal space between ribs 5 &amp; 6 or 6 &amp; 7 on the left side of the subject. The transducer mount was a bridge configuration similar to those used by Nusholtz [13] (Fig. 1a). Installation required blunt dissection of the muscles over the 5th intercostal space, where the interspace intersects a transverse plane through a point halfway between the palpated center of the xiphoid and mid-sternum. Following the dissection, the periosteum of each rib was elevated around its entire circumference. The accelerometer mount was then wire wrapped to the two exposed ribs using .025 " stainless steel safety aircraft wire. After the wire was tightened with an aircraft wire twister, four to eight pointed set screws were screwed through tapped holes in the mount. This caused the entire mount to rise and removed any slack in the safety wire while simultaneously anchoring the mount in the periosteum of the ribs via the cone points on the screws. With this procedure, fixation of the accelerometer mount was accomplished without penetration of the thoracic wall, thereby precluding pneumothorax. Another uniaxial accelerometer (Fig. 1b) was screw mounted to the 6th rib on the right side of the subject, directly opposite the left side accelerometer. Since the impacts were to the left side of all subjects in this study, the left side will be called nearside, and the right side will be called farside throughout the remainder of this report. Two uniaxial accelerometers were also attached to the spinous process in the same transverse plane as the rib accelerometers using a clamp-on mount (Fig. 1c). These accelerometers were mounted orthogonally such that one axis of sensitivity was oriented ventro-dorsally and the other transversely (i.e., in the direction of sled travel). The spinal and farside rib mounts also served as bases for photographic targets. * The rationale and experimental protocol for the use of an animal model in this program have been reviewed by the Research Laboratories' Animal Research Committee. The research follows procedures outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health NIH Publication 85-23, Revised 1985, and Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions, NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, Vol. 14, No. 8, June 25, 1985, and complies with the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544), as amended in 1970 (P.L. 91-579)and 1976 (P.L. 94-270), and the Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-158). «i ^ tv _i •■T; T 9 . 35 - 40.64 - f o o 2' 1T ~o o =, C= 25.40 ¥oñoV =, C= 25.40 I Figure 1a.

The purpose of the rod was to serve as a photographic target which would allow accurate measurement of the absolute skeletal deflection as It moved relative to another target fixed to a rib on the opposite side of the subject. This measurement was necessary to determine the effects of skeletal compression on the organs within the ribcage. The rod was made of stainless steel tubing (.148" O.D.) with a round nylon tip. It was inserted through the intercostal muscles after the periosteal elevation mentioned previously, but before the rib mount was wired on. The rod was pushed through the intercostal muscles and parietal pleura using just enough force to break through the pleura. When it was just inside the thoracic cavity, a purse-string suture was tightened and tied around it to effect a seal and prevent pneumothorax. The rod was then laid down along the original incision line pointed in a caudal-ventral direction, and advanced cautiously until it contacted the diaphragm. After contact with the diaphragm, the direction of motion of the tip was changed to rnedial-ventral. The tip was "walked" along the left diaphragm to the mediastinum, pushed through, and "walked" along the right diaphragm until it contacted the farside thoracic wall. It was then "walked" along the farside ribs until perpendicular to a sagittal plane at which point it was pushed through the farside wall. The rod was ball joint connected to the nearside accelerometer mount, which was then wire wrapped to the nearside ribs. (See the appendix in [16] for additional details concerning this trans-thoracic rod and its installation procedure.) After implanting the instrumentation, the subject was transported under anesthesia and placed in a lateral impact fixture on a Hyge Sled. The fixture consisted of a smooth surface on which the subject was placed, an impact wall made up of two load plates (similar to those used in [9] and [10]; see below), and a rebound net to manage the subject's post-impact motion (Fig. 2). The subject was placed on the sled fixture oriented transversely and positioned 1 8" from the loading surface. Figure 2. Schematic of lateral impact sled fixture used to generate the impact velocity desired. The impact wall is on the right, with the direction of sled travel towards the left. In these experiments, the sled was used as a velocity generator. That is, the fixture was designed so that the impact took place after the primary acceleration of the sled, while it was traveling at nearly constant velocity. As the sled accelerated, inertia and low surface friction kept the subject virtually stationary until struck by the loading plates. When Impact occurred, the sled was moving at the preselected velocity which was nominally 15, 20, 25, or 30 mph. The compression and kinematic response of the subject was monitored by an overhead camera mounted on the sled and by two offboard cameras at the same height as the subject with a view perpendicular to the direction of sled travel. The surviving subject was reconnected to the anesthesia machine and monitored immediately after Impact, followed by administration of euthanasia using T- 61 or an overdose of Methoxyflurane, or both. A gross thoraco-abdominal necropsy was then performed, and in the last 9 experiments tissue samples from the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines were also collected and sent to a pathology laboratory for microscopic analysis. Necropsy consisted of exposure of the abdominal cavity by midsagittal incision, followed by exposure of the thoracic cavity by excision of the sternum. The character and severity of each thoracic and abdominal injury was then noted and documented according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS-85) which was developed for coding injuries to humans. The experiments were performed in two series. The first series of experiments consisted of 8 subjects. The sled fixture had two load plates separated by a gap (Fig. 3). Each plate was mounted to an array of three load cells, which were in turn mounted rigidly on the impact wall. The larger load plate was intended to measure the force against the subject's thoracic region, and the smaller load plate to measure the force against the subject's pelvic region. The gap between the plates was 8" wide, 3.25" deep, and 13" high. This load plate arrangement was chosen because it resembled the arrangement used in the NHTSA sponsored experiments at the University of Heidelberg upon which the Thoracic Trauma Index is based [see 9,10]. The load plates were geometrically (RIGID WALL) PLA T e' THORAX722iT~~~~~-- ^INĪERPLATE GAP 1 |p I |pj 71 356 i i i &gt; J III' II -1^- J 254 - h ^ - 457 203 h H 1676 MM - Figure 3.

This would allow comparison of our results with an established human cadaver data base. In addition to the interplate gap, the subjects in the first series each had a transthoracic rod implanted. The second series of experiments consisted of 8 subjects and a control subject which was instrumented exactly as the others but not subjected to impact. The interplate gap was filled in this series by a rigid steel plate which was mounted flush with the thoracic and pelvic plates (Fig. 4). Forces imposed on the plate filling the interplate gap were not recorded, and none of these subjects had a trans-thoracic rod. Figure 4. Load measuring arrangement with the filled interplate gap. RESULTS Chi-squared analysis was performed on the injury outcomes from the two series of experiments (Table 1). The Chi-squared test determines if two groups of data are independent of common factors. The results showed that the number of AIS &gt; = 3 injuries to the liver, spleen, and ribs was significantly greater in the gap/rod series than in the no-gap/no-rod series of experiments. The level of significance was 90% for injury to the liver and ribs, and 97.5% for injury to the spleen (Table 2). The closest organs to the rod were the lungs, heart, and dome of the diaphragm (Fig. 5). When implanted, the rod was situated across the thorax approximately 2.5-4 cm (1-1.5 inches) cranial from the dome of the diaphragm. The lacerations in all three of the livers that were seriously injured in the first series of experiments were remote from this location. One laceration occurred at the hilar junction of the caudal vena cava with the right lateral lobe; another laceration was noted in the left lateral lobe on the visceral surface of the liver (the side opposite the rod); the other two lacerations were in the left lateral lobe on the parietal surface of the liver, but these were at the lateral edges away from the dome of the diaphragm. Minor hepatic injuries occurred mainly on the visceral surface of the liver, but in two cases occurred on the parietal surface (one subject had a superficial laceration in the right lateral lobe, and another subject had two contusions with one in the right medial lobe and another in the left medial lobe). Therefore, there was only one case in which the rod was in the vicinity of an injury and was a possible causative factor of the injury. In addition, most of the liver lacerations occurred in the left lobes of the liver. That is consistent with being caused by the impact wall, and the edge of the thoracic load plate. Figure 5. Typical positioning of the rod in situ. The rod lies just ventral to the caudal vena cava, posterior to the heart, and cranial to the diaphragm. The accessory lobe of the right lung (typically not seen in humans) can be seen wrapped around the rod. 1723</page><page sequence="5">TABLE 1 .

The liver from one of the subjects showed signs of hemorrhage microscopically, but did not show gross signs of injury. Therefore, it was considered to be uninjured for purposes of comparison. The spleen is located on the left side, dorsal to the stomach. In this location it is farther removed from the rod than the liver, and as a result it is less likely to be injured by the rod. However, the anatomical position of the subject's spleen in these tests was exactly along the edge of the thoracic load plate (Fig. 6). The centerline of the spleen ran between ribs 13 and 14, right along the edge of the plate. The plate edge, therefore, seems to be the most likely candidate as the causative factor for injury to the spleen. In the second series of experiments there were no serious splenic injuries. The spleen was contused in 5 of the 8 subjects examined. Splenic contusion in impacts at velocities between 15 and 30 mph is not surprising given the organ's anatomical location and proximity to the loading surface. According to the Abbreviated Injury Scale, when 4 or more consecutive ribs are fractured, with or without hemothorax, the injury is considered to be serious (AIS 2 3). In 6 out of 8 experiments involving the gap, 4 or more consecutive nearside ribs fractured causing serious injury. The fractured ribs were in the range of ribs 10-15 (remote from the rod) with the closest fracture at least 4 ribs away from the location of the rod in all but one case. In experiment number 2, the two ribs on which the nearside accelerometer mount was attached and another adjacent rib fractured. It appears that this fracture was caused by a stress concentration at the edge of the accelerometer mount. Therefore, a second Chi-squared analysis was performed which excluded experiment number 2. The difference in injury potential between gap/rod tests and no-gap/no-rod tests, was still significant although only at the 90% level of significance instead of the 95% level. Figure 6. Relative position of the porcine thorax to the load plates and interplate gap. Thorax length has been geometrically scaled to the length of the thorax plate. In each experiment the subject was positioned so that the centerline of the thorax plate would contact the sixth rib. In the second series of experiments, only 2 of the 8 subjects sustained serious injuries to the ribs (serious means I 4 consecutive ribs fractured). In both cases the consecutive rib fractures occurred in the last 5 ribs and in close proximity to the junction of the rib with the vertebral body. As seen In Fig. 6, the edge of the thoracic load plate was aligned between ribs 12 and 15 when the subject was positioned on the sled fixture. Therefore, It is reasonable to assume that the plate edge and interplate gap were responsible for the higher incidence of rib fractures. DISCUSSION Injuries to the spleen, liver, and ribs were of significantly greater severity in the series of experiments with the interplate gap and the trans-thoracic rod. Thus, either the presence of the rod, the presence of the interplate gap, or both were responsible for the difference. We believe the interplate gap was the causative factor and that the rod did not play a role In the aggravation of injury frequency or severity. The reasoning in support of this hypothesis lies in the similarity of pulmonary injury in the two series of experiments, and in the relatively large distance between the rod and the abdominal organs that were Injured. Although the rod traversed the thorax in contact with the lungs, the severity of pulmonary injury was unchanged when comparing injuries sustained with the gap and rod versus without. Since the rod did not injure the lungs with which it was in contact, it is unlikely that it injured abdominal organs located further away from it. Therefore, the Increased injury severity to the organs not in contact with the lungs is more likely due to the impacting surface. Examination of Tables 1 and 2 shows that with the interplate gap there was significantly greater risk of serious rib, liver, and spleen injury in these lateral impacts. As seen in Fig. 7, the subject's abdomen tended to extrude into the gap by virtue of its inertia and compliance. This filling of the gap was accomplished by bending around the edge of the load plates, which undoubtedly caused increased stress in the organs involved. Although the plate edges were rounded with a 1/2" radius and thus were not sharp, the stiffness discontinuity between the plate edge and the gap into which the organs extruded, probably caused stress concentrations which resulted in the injuries. The limbs of the subjects in these experiments were positioned so that they were out of the way of the impact with the wall. The forelimbs were stretched out cranially and the hind limbs were stretched out caudally. Therefore, the influence of "arm" position on injuries caused by gaps is not known. Cesari, et al. [4] analyzed pendulum data which suggested that the human arm may protect the thorax at low speed, but noted that the type of injuries did not seem to be affected by an Interposed arm. As mentioned, these studies were designed to resemble the NHTSA sponsored studies at the University of Heidelberg upon which their side Impact data are based. In some of those tests there was also a gap, but not enough injury information was available to determine any increased injury severity from that gap. In addition, 1725</page><page sequence="7">the gap in our experiments was larger than that in the Heidelberg experiments since it was geometrically scaled to the larger porcine thoracic length. Thus there may be some critical gap size, above which increased injury production occurs, and below which no aggravation of injuries occurs. All eight subjects in the first series of experiments died spontaneously. In the second series of experiments, the four subjects in the lower velocity impacts ( &lt; 24.6 mph) survived, and the four subjects in the higher velocity impacts ( &gt; 24.6 mph) died spontaneously. All cases of spontaneous death appear to be related to failure of the respiratory system. In the first series, the probable cause of death was pneumothorax induced around the trans- thoracic rod during impact. The rod entered the thorax through the intercostal muscles which were difficult to seal well enough to prevent the passage of air during the impact. In the second series, one possible cause of death was suffocation due to massive hemoptysis or coughing up blood (with the blood blocking the respiratory passages). Hemoptysis is a common symptom of pulmonary contusion but is usually not fatal in humans [1,6,14]. Alternatively, in studies of blast injuries to various species Benzinger [3] noted that "almost all animals exposed to blast near the lethal limit while (under anesthesia) died of respiratory paralysis. No other findings were made which would explain their death." Two of the four subjects which died spontaneously in these tests had respiratory arrest within 8 seconds of impact. One subject had respiratory arrest 52 seconds after impact, and one respirometer stopped functioning 4 seconds after impact but during a period of apnea that had lasted 1.5 seconds. In all four cases, blood pressure remained at pre-impact levels at least until after respiration ceased. (Blood pressure reached zero in 2-4 minutes for all 4 tests.) Therefore, respiratory arrest by some reflex mechanism or due to depressed respiratory centers while under anesthesia was the likely cause of death in the experiments in which the subjects died spontaneously. Pulmonary, renal, intestinal, and myocardial injuries were indistinguishable between the two series of experiments. Typically the pulmonary, intestinal, and myocardial contusions were of minor severity, and there were no or very minor renal contusions. Then, in comparison to the experiments with the gap, those with the flat continuous wall produced relatively minor and fewer injuries. It is striking that the injuries were not more severe in the experiments without the gap especially those performed at very high impact velocities (which are also subject delta-v's). This leads to the conclusion that in addition to reducing the impact velocity, it appears to be beneficial to preserve the shape of the impinging surface. It has been shown that for the subjects of these experiments, lateral impact against a flat, rigid surface was less injurious than impact against a rigid surface which has the continuity of the surface broken by a gap. Therefore, indentations should be evaluated in the design of side door interiors. For example, from a biomechanical standpoint, the load distributing properties of doors in the area adjacent to a normally seated occupant's torso should be considered. When it is desired to incorporate pockets into door designs, a transition zone between regions of different stiffness may be enough to prevent the type of injury aggravation observed in these experiments. In contrast, since flat continuous surfaces have been shown to produce less severe injuries than those with Figure 7. Line drawing of impact event showing an overhead view of the extrusion of the abdomen into the interplate gap. (Amount of extrusion has been exaggerated for demonstration purposes.) 1726</page><page sequence="8">sharp discontinuities in them, a possible side door design could be one that maintains a flat surface near the occupant despite external crush of the vehicle. CONCLUSIONS Injuries to the spleen, liver, and ribs were of significantly greater severity in the series of experiments with the interplate gap and the trans-thoracic rod than in the series with no gap and no rod. The injuries observed in the gap/rod test series were more likely due to edge of the impacting surface and the interplate gap and were not influenced by the rod. Therefore, surfaces with areas into which localized portions of the body can extrude are potentially injurious. It is striking that injuries were not more severe in these tests, even at subject delta-v's of 30 mph. Therefore, in addition to reducing the velocity of an impinging surface, it appears to be beneficial to preserve a large, flat, continuous surface during impact.
