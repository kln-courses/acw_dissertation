<plain_text><page sequence="1">Novum Testamentum XXXII, 2 (1990) DREAM GENRE IN THE MATTHEAN INFANCY NARRATIVES by ROBERT GNUSE New Orleans, LA Scholarly evaluation of the Infancy Narratives1 has been under- taken in several critical studies, most recently the excellent work of George Soares Prabhu and Raymond Brown.2 In their exhaustive form-critical, redactional, and theological assessment they paid close attention to the dream reports found in those chapters. It would seem difficult to add to their insights, but a detailed study of the dream report formats in the ancient world and their subse- quent adoption by authors in the Hebrew Bible indicates that the lines of development continue through New Testament materials also. Renewed form-critical observation of this literature may generate new insights and help us focus more clearly upon theological nuances in the Infancy Narratives of Matthew 1-2. The suggestion by Soares Prabhu that the Matthean dream reports are derived from Genesis merits further consideration. Though he believes Matthean dreams depend upon Genesis 46:2-4, this author would argue for inclusion of all the patriarchal dreams in Genesis.3 His assessment was built upon an evaluation of linguistic style and content; this author seeks to undertake a form- critical assessment which emphasizes structure and overall genre. Furthermore, this study will address other questions about which a consensus has not been reached. For some there remains a reluc- I would like to thank Loyola University for the research grant which made this study possible. 2 George Soares Prabhu, The Formula Quotations in the Infancy Narrative of Mat- thew: An Enquiry into the Tradition History of Mt 1-2, AnBib 63 (Rome: Biblical Institute, 1976) 1-300; Raymond Brown, The Birth of the Messiah.: A Commentary on the Infancy Narratives in Matthew and Luke (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1977) 45-232. 3 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 223-225.</page><page sequence="2">98 ROBERT GNUSE tance to call the Matthean dreams a distinct literary genre,4 other scholars view the genre as the result of Hellenistic or contemporary Jewish dreams rather than having a direct connection with Genesis materials,5 and some look to the Joseph dreams in Genesis as the primary source of literary inspiration.6 In response this author believes the Matthean dreams take their inspiration from auditory message dreams in the Hebrew text, such as those received by Abimelech, Jacob, Laban, Balaam, and Solomon, rather than the symbolic visual dreams found in the Joseph novella and the book of Daniel.7 This essay shall seek to defend those observations as well as providing more nuanced insight into the significance of the dreams in the Matthean Infancy Narratives.

Leo Oppenheim.9 His evaluation has classified dreams into three types: 1) the auditory message dream, a clearly understood vocal message from a deity without significant visual imagery, 2) symbolic message dream, visual imagery which usually requires a professional dream interpreter's skill at decoding, and 3) psycho- logical status dream, fragmentary visual images usually requiring interpretation by a dream book to decode for the sake of removing the impurity brought upon the dreamer. The first two categories were the experiences of priests, kings, and significant personages recorded for the sake of social and political agenda, while the last category reflects the dreams of common people not worthy of recor- ding and otherwise unavailable to us were it not for the list of omina in the dream books used to interpret these common dream images. The first two categories were divine theophanies and in the stereotyped annals of the kings probably resemble actual dream experiences very little, while the last category included those fleeting nocturnal memories we call true dreams. For our consideration the auditory message dream merits special attention, for the Matthean dreams in the Infancy Narratives appear to be oral messages rather than visual apparitions. Oppenheim delineated the structure of the message dream as follows: I. A. Who-the recipient of the dream B. When-time of the dream C. Where-site, usually a shrine D. Conditions-circumstances surrounding the dream II. Dream Content-report of the visual imagery of a symbolic message dream or the spoken message of an auditory message dream III. Termination--statement to the effect that the dreamer awoke and realized it was a dream IV. Fulfillment--account of how the divine word came true or the human recipient undertook the command of the deity (this may follow in narrative form rather than being in the dream report proper) 9 Oppenheim, Interpretation, 179-255, "Mantic Dreams," 341-350, and "Fragments," 153-165.</page><page sequence="4">100 ROBERT GNUSE This pattern, gleaned from the dreams of Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Assyrian, Chaldean Babylonian, and Egyptian dream reports, seems to have been fairly common in the ancient world, especially in Mesopotamia. Initial consideration of the Matthean dreams indicates some points of continuity: reference to the reci- pient, appearance of divine figure, dream message, formal ter- mination, and fulfillment. But the correspondence is basic, perhaps superficial; both ancient near eastern dreams and Matthean dreams would be expected to share common form by virtue of being generic divine theophanies which commission the human recipient.10 The real form-critical and linguistic connection between these two sets of dreams may be the dream reports in the Hebrew Bible, especially those in Genesis which appear to belong to the pen- tateuchal source we call the Elohist. Analysis of these dreams has been undertaken by a number of fine studies." In previous work this author sought to demonstrate the continuity between ancient near eastern dream report formats and the biblical accounts."

Dream reports worthy of consideration include: Genesis 20:3-8 (Abimelech), 28:12-16 Uacob), 31:10-13 Uacob), 31:24 (Laban), 46:2-4 Uacob/Israel), Numbers 22:8-13 (Balaam), 22:20-21 (Balaam), I Kings 3:5-15 (Solomon). The pattern derived by this author for these dream reports is: I. Theophany II. Recipient III. Dream Reference IV. Time of Dream V. Auditory Message Dream Address Formula VI. Message A. Introductory Formula (particle hinneh) B. Divine Self-Identification C. Message Proper: Assurance, Promise, Warnings, or Commands to Recipient D. Dialogue VII. Fulfillment (usually follows in subsequent narrative)"1 The theophany is expressed by the phrase, "God/angel of God/ Lord came/stood/spoke/appeared." The recipient is the human dreamer, usually listed by name as the indirect object (le). The dream reference is almost always to a "dream" (haldm), only once to a "vision" (mar~oth) in Genesis 46:2. Night is usually listed as the time of the dream (Genesis 20:3, 31:24, 46:2, Numbers 22:20, I Kings 3:5). The auditory address formula (wayyo'mer) clearly indicates that God spoke-implying this is an auditory message dream not a visual apparition (only in Genesis 28:13, 31:10 is incidental visionary imagery implied). The message begins either with the particle "behold" (hinneh) in Genesis 20:3 or a vocative in Genesis 31:11, 46:2. God identifies himself in Genesis 28:13, 31:13, 46:3. Assurance of divine presence and promise are given in Genesis 28:13-15, 46:2-4, I Kings 3:5-15; directions are provided in Genesis 31:12-13, 46:2-3, Numbers 22:20; and orders are issued in Genesis 20:3, 31:24. Dialogue occurs in Genesis 20:4-5, 31:11, 46:2, Numbers 22:10-11, I Kings 3:5-15. Formal termination is provided in Genesis 20:8, 28:16, and I Kings 3:15 with the expres- sion that the recipient "awoke"; I Kings 3:15 adds the formula, "it 13 Idem, Dream, 75-79.</page><page sequence="6">102 ROBERT GNUSE was a dream." Though the pattern is not perfectly uniform in every dream report, the language is stereotyped enough to warrant call- ing these texts part of a common form-critical genre. As we shall observe below the Matthean dreams seem to reflect an affinity with this particular auditory message dream format. Dream reports may also be observed in the classical world, in Greek and later Hellenistic sources. Since some scholars believe Matthew may have been influenced by such dream reports,14 one ought to consider these formulas likewise. Over the past few generations excellent studies have been generated by scholars in the classics concerning the nature and development of Greek dreams and their recording.15 Graeco-Roman sources know a complex development of the oneirocritic tradition, many diverse attitudes about dreams are expressed by classical authors. Contemporary scholars in classics would find it difficult to formulate a generic form-critical structure due to the wide variety of dreams and their 14 Kee, Miracle, 187. 15 A.

However, a very fine analysis of later Greek and Hellenistic dreams has been provided by John Hanson. He delineates the following format: I. Scene Setting A.

Dream Vision: Auditory Type A. Voice Is Heard B. Voice Is Identified C. Human Response IV. Reaction A. Dreamer Awakes B. Emotional Response of Dreamer C. Interpretation V. Fulfillment of Dream or Response to Dream'6 From the outline the reader might perceive the format ultimately may trace its roots to ancient near eastern predecessors. But Greek dreams are far more complex, especially in terms of portraying the mental processes and attitudes of the dreamer. Ancient near eastern and Hebraic dreams both contrast with the complex Greek and Hellenistic dream reports by virtue of their simplicity, terse language, and simple representation of the external circumstances of the theophanic experience. Matthean dreams parallel ancient near eastern and Hebraic dreams in this regard rather than the Greek models with a similar reserve style, and scholars have drawn attention to this point without drawing the conclusion that the Mat- thean dream report format may trace its lineage to the Hebrew Bible rather than to the contemporary milieu." The most colorful observation was made by Albrecht Oepke: 16 Hanson, "Dreams," 1405-1414 especially, but compare "Dream/Vision Report," 1-2 et passim. 17 Wikenhauser, "Traumgesichte," 321; Oepke, "wvap," 236; Andre Paul, L 'Evangile de l'enfance selon Saint Matthieu (Paris: Cerf, 1968) 150; Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 224-225, called them both "austere, concise, descriptions."</page><page sequence="8">104 ROBERT GNUSE To come from the dream world of antiquity to the NT is to leave a very profane and, for all its religion, very filthy world, and to enter the sanctuary. ... The things which dominate the ordinary dream world of antiquity, the riotous superstition, curiosity, perversion, the half hopeful, half-despairing questioning as to one's personal fate, are all completely obliterated, swallowed up in the peace of God.18 It is the contention of this author that Matthean dreams may depend upon both Hebraic and Greek cultural values, but ultimately what Oepke senses (even if a little overstated), reflects that Matthean dream reports draw upon the forms in Genesis. As in so many instances the Infancy Narratives again demonstrate their origin as midrashic variations on themes in the Hebrew Bible. II. Matthean Dream Reports Five dreams are mentioned in the Infancy Narratives of Matthew 1-2 (1:20-25, 2:12, 2:13-15, 2:19-21, 2:22). Full accounts are given for three of these (1:20-25, 2:13-15, 2:19-21), distinguished not only by the presence of the message but also by reference to the angel of the Lord. The dream theophanies include: 1) Joseph's encouragement to take Mary as his wife, 2) the warning for the wise men to return directly home, 3) Joseph's command to go to Egypt, 4) Joseph's command to return to "Israel," and 5) Joseph's com- mand to live in Gallilee. As commentators have often noted the language of these dreams, especially the fuller reports, is quite stereotypic. An angel of the Lord appears in a dream to deliver an oral message, like ancient near eastern auditory message dreams. The message carries both warning and a command to travel somewhere. A formal termina- tion of the dream is mentioned and the fulfillment of the command by the dream recipient is described in the ensuing narrative. Even in the two instances wherein the actual dream report is lacking (Matthew 2:12, 2:22) the reader could hypothetically construct rather easily a dream report which would conform to the fuller pat- tern (whether this actually implies that a fuller version of our text included such dream reports cannot be ascertained). The stereotypic nature of the language associated with the dreams has invited scholars to make form-critical observations about the text. Wilfred Knox delineated four parts: 1) introductory 18 Oepke, "&amp;vaxp," 236.</page><page sequence="9">DREAM GENRE IN MATTHEW 1-2 105 genitive absolute, 2) the expression "behold" and reference to the angel of the Lord appearing in a dream, 3) Joseph awakens and obeys, and 4) a saying is fulfilled.'9 Bruce Malina's categories were more general: 1) command, 2) explanation (lacking in Matthew 2:12 and 2:22-23), and 3) fulfillment.20 Andr6 Paul's categories included: 1) situation, 2) "behold" followed by appearance of the angel to Joseph in a dream, 3) Old Testament quote, and 4) fulfill- ment of quote.21 Soares Prabhu provided the most detailed analysis: 1) introductory genitive absolute with 8uo6, 2) description of the dream event, 3) message containing command and explana- tion (following the particle y&amp;dp), 4) account of execution of com- mand, and 5) formula quotation.22 Brown likewise provided a detailed outline: 1) introductory clause (genitive absolute, postpositive U6, and 18o6), 2) angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, 3) command, 4) reason for command, and 5) Joseph arises and fulfills command.23 Other form-critical patterns have been observed. Edgar Conrad compared the first dream report with the Hebraic announcement of the birth of a son: 1) announcement of birth and the expression, "behold," 2) designation of a name, and 3) specification of the child's identity.24 This raises the possibility that the first dream report might once have been a birth announcement formula, or perhaps the birth announcement for- mula imagery was added by Matthew at this point, or that the text was a synthesis of the two forms from its creation. Soares Prabhu and John Crossan have also noted that the dream reports "confirm rigidly to a command-execution pattern" from the Hebrew Bible and are pure paradigms of prompt obedience to the will of God.25 19 Wilfrid Knox, The Sources of the Synoptic Gospels, vol. 2: Saint Luke and Saint Matthew (Cambridge, England: University Press, 1957) 122. 20 Bruce Malina, "Matthew 2 and Is 41, 2-3: A Possible Relationship?," Studii Biblici Franciscani Liber Annuus 17 (1967): 291. 21 Paul, Matthieu, 143-145. 22 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 235. Soares Prabhu, 235-236, also noted varia- tions: 1) in 1:18-25 there is an introductory narrative, 2) vocabulary in 1:18-25 is more complex than in 2:13-15, 3) the formula xar' wvoxp comes before the verb in 1:18-25, and 4) in 1:18-25, the verb form is c&amp;pvrl, rather than cpavEr-aL which occurs in chapter 2. Soares Prabhu suggested this implied 1:18-25 was changed by Matthew from the original pattern, though the possibility of Matthean creation was not dismissed. 23 Brown, Birth, 108. 24 Edgar Conrad, "The Annunciation of Birth and the Birth of the Messiah," CBQ 47 (1985): 656-663. 25 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 185; and J. Crossan, "Moses to Jesus," 36.</page><page sequence="10">106 ROBERT GNUSE Finally, D. M. Crossan has observed a greater pattern in the entire Infancy Narratives of how dream reports and fulfillment citations alternate.26 All these commentators sensed a similar pattern, which was best described by Soares Prabhu as, ... stylized "stills": an angelophany described in a single stereotyped phrase; a brief message consisting of a command given in a series of sharp imperatives.... The narratives are formal, colourless, impersonal. They belong to a high theological literary form.27 Yet despite the insightful form-critical analysis by all these com- mentators, no one drew the comparison with the form-critical structure of the Elohist dream reports in Genesis. Soares Prabhu came close in his analysis by observing that the dream in Matthew 2:13-15 appears to be a more compact version of Genesis 46:2-4 (Jacob/Israel at Beersheba)28-though he assumed the connection to be through the LXX text.29 He likewise observed the theological continuity between the Genesis dreams and Matthew: they are "Heilsgeschichte" dreams, that is, God provides direction to the recipient rather than prediction of the future, as is common in most ancient dreams.30 A few scholars admitted influence of the Genesis dream format without investigating the matter further.3' Others, however, believed Matthew's dreams reflect primarily Hellenistic influence,32 and some refused to observe the presence of a stylized form in the Matthean accounts at all.33 Hopefully, the contribution of this article shall be to outline in detail the form-critical dependence of Matthean dreams upon the Elohist dreams in Genesis and the implications of that relationship. This author would propose the following outline of the Matthean dream reports on the basis of form-critical analysis: I. Situation--provided by the narrative II. Introduction of the Dream Report A.

Observations: 1) It is noteworthy that the genitive absolute occurs in the fuller dream format; otherwise a simple aorist participle is found. Previous commentators did not note the use of participles in every report, they merely observed usage of the genitive absolute. This implies a greater patterning than is usually observed. 2) "Behold" is an introductory particle to the dream message; in the Elohist dream format it is part of the verbal message used to introduce the message proper. Perhaps its presence in Genesis (hinneh) has carried into the Matthean framework around the message rather than in the message. 3) The verbal form of "appear" is different in Mat- thew 1:20 than in 2:13 and 2:19, which adds fuel to the speculation that the first dream report has undergone complex redaction.34 4) The most significant form-critical development in relationship to the Genesis dreams is the very clear statement in terms about the fulfillment of the command. 5) Fulfillment of the command always involves physical movement in Matthew (as it often does in Genesis), and the Greek tends to use stereotypic language to des- cribe this movement: Joseph "takes" (apiXb,3apev) the mother and child, and wise men/Joseph "depart" (&amp;veXpijaev). 6) It seems inappropriate to include the fulfillment of an old prophetic saying "4 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 235-236.</page><page sequence="14">110 ROBERT GNUSE in the dream format, as many commentators do.35 For with the first dream the fulfillment citation occurs within the dream message proper (Matthew 1:22-23). The second dream to the Magi (merely a reference to a dream) and the fourth dream to Joseph (a full report) both lack a citation reference. Only the third and fifth dreams, both to Joseph, the former a full dream report and the lat- ter a dream reference, contain fulfillment citations (Matthew 2:15 and 2:23) in the appropriate place. The appearance of citations with either full dream reports or dream references is not consistent, as is the case with so many other component parts of the dream for- mat (dream references tend to omit certain parts consistently). Fur- thermore, fulfillment citations occur in the Infancy Narratives unrelated to dream reports altogether (Matthew 2:5-6 and 2:17- 18). It would seem that fulfillment citations occur as insertions into the basic narrative but not in direct association with dream reports. The message found within the dream reports may be further delineated with the following form-critical outline, which relies significantly upon Soares Prabhu's analysis:36 Matthew 1:20-21 vocative "Joseph, son of David" assurance "do not fear" (1i &lt;po3rl0?q) command "to take" (opocXap,iv) object "Mary your wife" (Mplocv 'v yTuvbxc a aou) explanation 1. reason "for (y&amp;p) that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit," 2. development "she will bear a son," (r26ezrt 8~ ui6v) a. naming "and you shall call his name Jesus," (xoi b. mission "for he will save his people from their sin" Matthew 2:13 command "rise" ('yepOei) "take" (capda&amp;Xae) object "the child and his mother" (r6 irat ov xocx TJv .1TI-roe oCoV ) direction "and flee to Egypt and remain there till I tell you" 35 Knox, Sources, 122; Paul, Matthieu, 143-145; Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 235. 36 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 238-239.</page><page sequence="15">DREAM GENRE IN MATTHEW 1-2 111 explanation "for (y&amp;p) Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him" (qrelytv Tb 7~Lat&amp;ov) Matthew 2:20 command "rise" ('yeepOi) "take" (icap&amp;XAaxe) object "the child and his mother" (T6b ot&amp;ov xX0L tiv direction "and go to the land of Israel" explanation "for (y&amp;p) those who sought the child's life are dead" (ol tro 0oveT S Tjv 4uX lv ToG 6ratn&amp;ou) All three messages conform to stereotyped linguistic patterns using key vocabulary for the significant component parts of the form-critical structure. It is to be noted how the outline corresponds to the type of message found in the Genesis dream reports. Further- more, an additional development in the first dream report deserves special attention. The dream message is followed by a prophetic citation (1:22-23): "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son (xai zTizgt ui6v) and his name will be called Emmanuel (xci xa~caouatv zb Tivoyat ao ro 'Et.ayvoulX), which means, God with us." The dream message in 1:21 has been formulated to parallel the subsequent quotation. This only lends further weight to the supposition that the dream format provided by Matthew is redac- tional creation. In the discussion concerning which materials are received from the oral tradition and which are redactional (either by Matthew or an earlier stage of redaction), this study would tend to affirm that Matthew 1:20-21, 2:12a, 13, 19-20, 22b certainly carry the ear- mark of redactional activity. These verses do not include portions of the "Situation" and "Fulfillment of Command" outlined in the overall dream format previously, for they stand apart from the actual theophanic report, and they may have existed in narrative form in the prior tradition. Furthermore, the utilization of some narrative, potentially germane to the plot, also is found integrated into the dream format in these verses just isolated. Whether or not this material had a prior existence in some other form cannot be determined conclusively. Thus our observations in this regard must remain merely tentative suggestions. General consideration of the overall nature of the five dream reports impresses the reader with the remarkable similarity of</page><page sequence="16">112 ROBERT GNUSE language. They conform to an ideal report, even the truncated dream references, to a far greater degree than their counterparts in Genesis, which can show some fluidity of detail.37 Yet the form- critical dependence shows Matthew's clear usage of that old dream report model. Matthew has used it and stereotyped it to a far greater degree. Our close comparison with the dream format used in Genesis hopefully demonstrates greater similarity than might have been perceived by a surface reading of the text. The Genesis dreams begin with reference to divine theophany, human recipient, reference to the dream, and time of theophany. The Matthean account likewise has a theophany ("angel of the Lord") dream reference ("in a dream"), human recipient, and reference to place. Dream reference and recipient have been switched in the Matthean accounts, and an allusion to time has been replaced by allusion to place (which may or may not be important, since it only occurs in one account). Matthean dream reports begin with the particle, "behold," which is reminiscent of the introductory "behold" (hinneh) in the Genesis dreams that initiate the auditory message. The transference may be incidental, but the choice of vocabulary might reflect the influence of Hebrew idiom upon the Matthean account. Both the Genesis and the Matthean dreams introduce the divine message with vocabulary designed to emphasize the auditory nature of the dream theophany: hebrew wayyoSmer and greek X,'ycv, both of which translate as "say." Though the Genesis dreams exhibit a wider range of message content (assurance, promise, war- ning, command), the Matthean dreams fall clearly within this range. They provide assurance and direct the human recipient to go somewhere, which certainly was primary in most of the Genesis dreams. By contrast the Matthean dreams are consistent through- out in their content: assurance and command occur with stereotypic language as shown in the charts above. The divine self- identification found in the Genesis dreams is missing in the Mat- thean dreams, since the latter need not identify God in the story set- ting, for the cultural assumption of the audience is monotheistic, be they Jewish Christians or later Gentile Christians. In the Hebrew dreams, even for monotheistic readers, the assumption would be that God must identify himself to the patriarchs, for they might not 37 Gnuse, Dream, 75-79.</page><page sequence="17">DREAM GENRE IN MATTHEW 1-2 113 otherwise be too sure which deity had approached them. Dialogue occasionally found in the Genesis dreams is lacking in the Matthean dreams, either due to the desire for form-critical simplicity in the style of Matthew or as a result of the author's view of God and the immutable divine plan of salvation. Formal termination concludes both the Genesis and Matthean dream reports: in Genesis the dream recipient is said to have awakened, whereas in Matthew Joseph arose from sleep. Matthean dreams exhibit creativity only with references to the actual fulfillment of the dream command. In those Genesis dreams where commands are issued, the fulfillment of the command becomes readily apparent in the extended narrative thereafter. But the Matthean dreams record fulfillment to the divine command directly following the theophany, perhaps implying the immediate and obedient response to the divine will was a virtue to be emulated.3" This would accord itself well with the imperative throughout the gospel to "follow Jesus" obediently. The five reports of how the recipient fulfilled the command (1:24, 2:12, 2:14-15, 2:21, 2:22) in the narrative material do not contain stereotypic formulaic language. Rather they provide substance to the narrative plot (which has led commentators to surmise two separate sources of narratives and dreams). Consideration of the vocabulary reveals only minor similarity involving action oriented verbs. In two instances (2:14, 2:21) Joseph "took the child" (ocp6~aXpEv) and three times individuals (2:12, 2:14, 2:22) "departed" (dv'E~cp-Pjaov). These coincidences may be due only to the general economy of literary style evident in the Infancy Nar- ratives. Even though the fulfillment references are relatively brief, they are more elaborate than the rest of the dream report format used by Matthew. Comparison with the Genesis dream reports leads one to suspect the Matthean accounts put special emphasis upon the notion of fulfillment by the presence of narrative elabora- tion, again suggesting the Matthean theme of obedience to the divine will. To this author it seems evident that the Matthean dream format is more directly dependent upon the Genesis dream reports than other patterns, such as contemporary Greek reports. Both the 38 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 208; Kenneth Gros Louis, "Different Ways of Looking at the Birth of Jesus," Bible Review 1,1 (1985): 37, 40.</page><page sequence="18">114 ROBERT GNUSE dreams in Genesis and Matthew characterize the dreamer and his physical or psychological status far less than Greek counterparts. Both types are more vague about the time of the dream theophany than Greek dream reports. Though the Genesis dream reports parallel Greek dreams over against those in Matthew by identifying the divine voice in the message proper, this may only reflect a shared assumption by the respective readers that the dramatic per- sonages live in a potentially polytheistic setting and therefore must have the deity identify himself or herself directly. Matthean dreams naturally assume the dramatic personages to be monotheists. Finally, the stereotypic language in Matthew appears to be almost translated from the Genesis dreams, including the reference to the "angel of the Lord" and the particle "behold". The question which remains is: what are the implications of this dependency? III. Matthew's Use of Dream Reports How did Matthew come to inherit and/or use these dream reports in the Infancy Narratives? Commentators have pointed to the popularity of dreams in contemporary Jewish writings. Imagery in these accounts may have affected Matthew's propensity to use the dream format, in this author's opinion, but Matthew did not draw upon a source which had followed contemporary Jewish midrashic style. Several contemporary accounts do merit attention because they are dreams associated with Moses and the Exodus experience, thus implying some midrash might be a forerunner for details in the Infancy Narratives. In Josephus Moses' birth was foretold to Pharaoh by seers who interpreted a sign, just as magi gave word of the Messiah to Herod (Ant II, 205). (In Palestinian Targum TJI on Exodus 1:15 Pharaoh himself receives warning via a dream). Both Pharaoh and Herod then killed the baby boys. Also in Josephus' version, Amram, the father of Moses, received a dream about the birth of his son (Ant II, 212-217), comparable to Joseph's dream in Matthew.39 In Biblical Antiquities 9:10 of Pseudo-Philo Miriam has a dream and tells her parents Amram and Jochebed that an angel in linen advised her that the family need not fear to sire a baby boy under Pharaoh's rule. The similarity of Miriam's 39 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 288-292; J. Crossan, "Moses to Jesus," 22-23.</page><page sequence="19">DREAM GENRE IN MATTHEW 1-2 115 name with Mary and the parental fear to have a son with Joseph's reservations about Mary are noteworthy.40 Brown believes these parallels influenced Matthew's use of dreams as a theophanic device (he also includes the Chronicle of Moses in the discussion); he even suggests that Matthew 2:13 may have contained an additional account of a dream to warn Herod as a parallel to Pharaoh's predic- tive sign.41 All these dreams are associated with the Moses tradition and this raises another avenue of investigation explored in great detail by Brown. He believes the Infancy Narratives were modelled exten- sively upon the accounts of Moses in Exodus and Joseph in Genesis. Like Moses Jesus was hunted by an evil ruler as a baby, he fled his country, returned when the ruler had died, and ultimately saved his people. Jesus went into Egypt like Jacob in Genesis 46:2-4 at the bidding of a dream, and returned as Israel did to the promised land (which Matthew 2:15 implies). Like the Joseph accounts in Genesis there are dreams which propel the plot, and the hero goes to Egypt.42 Brown's detailed analysis is convinc- ing, the Infancy Narratives appear to be midrash on accounts from the Pentateuch. This essay reinforces Brown's basic thesis by poin- ting out connections with earlier patriarchal material in Genesis. However, Matthew's dream format has not been derived from the symbolic dreams of Joseph in Genesis (as Brown and Gundry imply) nor from the Jewish materials contemporary with Matthew (as Crossan implies). To be sure this material may have influenced Matthew to utilize dreams as a theophanic device. However, the Joseph dreams are visual and symbolic, as we have seen, this is a totally different genre from the auditory dreams of Matthew. Con- temporary Jewish dreams, on the other hand, are too amorphous in their structure compared to the "disciplined structure" of the Matthean dreams. The Matthean format finds its inspiration in the Elohist dreams of the patriarchal narratives. The next question concerning Matthew's reception of the dream material attempts to discern the process of traditions-development. The central issue for commentators is whether the dreams source was pre-Matthean or generated with the final stages of Matthean 40 Brown, Birth, 116. 41 Ibid., 114-115. 42 Ibid., 104-119. Cf. Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 212-214; Gundry, Matthew, 22-23.</page><page sequence="20">116 ROBERT GNUSE redaction. Unlike the first question of form-critical influence the reconstruction of the process of redaction must remain tentative. Several commentators believe Matthew generated the dream for- mat. Gundry, for example, believes the pre-Matthean tradition had visions, but under the influence of the Joseph accounts in Genesis Matthew converted them into dreams.43 Bertram Smith feels the angel of the Lord was the original vehicle of revelation, but Mat- thew converted it into the dream mode (in Matthew 27:19 the reference is only to dream, and this is a pure Matthean text).44 But this overlooks the Genesis dream format wherein dream theophanies are connected with the angel of the Lord in Elohist texts. Brown's critique that the two terms were introduced together probably stands as correct in this regard.45 The more extensive redaction-critical studies have assumed the pre-Matthean origin of the dream format.46 Soares Prabhu observes that a novelistic Herod source is woven together with a more static dreams source. A memory of Jesus' exile in Egypt was shaped like the Moses account in Exodus. The dream in Matthew 2:13-15 patterned after Jacob's entry into Egypt (Genesis 46:2-4) explained Jesus' exile, then the dream in 2:19-21 imitated the first in order to explain Jesus' return, like Moses in Exodus 4:19-20. At a later time the long dream report in 1:18-25 was constructed out of the first two dreams and subsequently expanded to include a "birth oracle." Finally, the dream report in 2:22 was added as an afterthought, once Jesus was in "Israel," a clarification was required to explain the move to Galilee. This dream format was thus inherited by Matthew, or the final redactor." Brown believes that the dream format was pre-Matthean, especially the full dream reports with reference to the angel of the Lord. Matthew added the story of the magi which displaced the account of a dream received by Herod, then Matthew added two brief notices about dreams in Matthew 2:12 and 2:22-23 which lack reference to the angel of the 43 Gundry, Matthew, 22-23. 44 Bertram Smith, The Gospel According to Saint Matthew, Cambridge Greek Testament (Cambridge, England: University Press, 1950), 77. 45 Brown, Birth, 110, though Matthew introduced only the term xoxt' Svoap. 46 Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 171-172, 209-226, 295-296; Brown, Birth, 104- 119; G.

But individual theories of development, however logical, remain hypothetical. The use of dreams in this material by Matthew has theological significance, or so we presume, by the mere desire to imitate mate- rial in Genesis. The rest of the New Testament has few dreams or visions: (in order of legitimate oneirocritic-like experience) Pilate's wife has a dream (6vcxp) in Matthew 27:19, Paul has a vision (pipatx.) of a man of Macedon in Acts 16:9, Cornelius saw the angel of the Lord in Acts 10:1-8, Peter heard a voice with a vision in Acts 10:9-20, Paul received encouragement from the angel of the Lord in Acts 18:9, 23:11, 27:23, and perhaps the experiences of Paul and Ananias in Acts 9:3-17 might be somewhat dream-like. The list is small when compared to five distinct references to dream (0vap) in the Infancy Narratives, and that alone makes them significant. Generally commentators perceive the New Testament is critical of dreams, for the authors wish nothing to impinge upon the cen- trality of Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation.49 As the Hebrew prophets were critical of dreams (especially Jeremiah 23:25-32, 27:9-10, 29:8-9), so are the New Testament authors, for dreams are not a clear revelation of divine will, because dreams in the ancient world usually required further interpretation (especially symbolic or predictive dreams). When dreams do occur they are clear auditory message dreams, for God must be understood clearly.50 Likewise, the simplicity of New Testament dreams and visions con- trasts with the bizarre complexity of Hellenistic dream reports as a result of the New Testament view of God and revelation. Only with later apocryphal Christian traditions will the contemporary style of Greek dreams emerge.5' Thus Matthew's dreams stand forth rather significantly in the New Testament. Upon observing that the Matthean dreams are form critically dependent upon the Elohist dreams in Genesis one might deduce 48 Brown, Birth, 104-119. 49 James Hillman, The Dream and the Underworld (New York: Harper and Row, 1979) 88. 50 Wikenhauser, "Traumgesichte," 321; Oepke, ""vorp," 235-236; Soares Prabhu, Quotations, 208. 51 Oepke, "vaop," 236-238.</page><page sequence="22">118 ROBERT GNUSE the theological significance of Matthew's dreams by determining the function of the dreams in Genesis. Dreams occur almost exclusively in the pentateuchal source known as the Elohist in Genesis. Here they serve as a form of revelation which assumes a distant, transcendent deity unlike the very anthropomorphic style of revelation found in the Yahwist. Dreams as an indirect form of divine theophany preserve the distance between God and the human realm.52 Matthew may have adapted the dream motif for that very reason-it highlights a distant, transcendent deity. This image of God would deliberately contrast with the immediacy of divine presence found in the person and ministry of Jesus in the heart of the gospel. The baby Jesus protected by dream theophanies will ultimately surpass them in grand fashion. Commentators have noted the contrast between the dream as a form of revelation inferior to Jesus, but they never isolated the particular reason.53 Consideration of the Elohist dreams more closely may permit us to see the Matthean point of contrast: distant revelation is compared to immediate incarnation-Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God because of his immanent presence among us. There may be other reasons for Matthew's use of the dream, many resulting from the Jewish orientation of the gospel. Jewish Christians would be familiar with pentateuchal dreams and the language associated with them. Dreams were a form of theophany which regarded God respectfully as a distant deity, much as the expression Kingdom of Heaven tended to do. Hence, the stereotypic simplicity of the dream reports may be a deliberate form of respect for the divine. The simple fact that there are five dreams may allude to the five books of Torah, hence the need to create two additional dream references to accompany the three full reports, if the redaction critics are correct- about the late addition of the two dream references. This literary allusion would be another example of how Matthew paradigms Jesus as the "new Moses.'"54 Contem- porary Jewish midrash used dreams as a mode of divine revelation due to respect for God, and Matthew may be following this tendency for the sake of the feelings it would elicit among his audience. Dreams may have been perceived as appropriate modes 52 Gnuse, Dream, 63-64. 53 Joseph Addison Alexander, The Gospel According to Matthew (New York: Scribners, 1860) 35; Oepke, "byvap," 235-236; Hillman, Dream, 88. 54 J. Crossan, "Moses to Jesus," 26.</page><page sequence="23">DREAM GENRE IN MATTHEW 1-2 119 by which to announce the birth of the Messiah, for such may be the case in some apocalyptic literature.55 Finally, as many commentators have noted, the dreams in Mat- thew provide the tool by which God clearly directs human affairs. The direct command-execution sequence observed with each dream report indicates how human obedience to the divine will is blessed. Every significant human action is controlled by God through dreams, often changing the natural direction initially undertaken by people. Dreams are the ultimate symbol of divine providence and guidance.56 Obedience brings deliverance; as such they are fitting paradigms for human behavior in a gospel which declares that the supreme duty is discipleship which heeds the call to follow Jesus. With the strong emphasis upon divine providence the Matthean dreams again are comparable to the Elohist dreams in Genesis. Both function in the dimension of "Heilsgeschichte," God leading his people through space and time to their ultimate destiny. The Elohist dreams in Genesis and Matthew's dreams provide divine direction for deliverance, they do not predict the future like dreams did for Joseph in Genesis and Daniel, nor do they offer promises as did Solomon's dream in I Kings 3, nor do they proclaim judg- ment as Samuel heard in I Samuel 3,57 nor do they give encourage- ment like Paul's visions in Acts 18:9, 23:11, 27:23. Only Paul's vision of the man of Macedon is similar in that direction is provided which ultimately promoted the salvific mission (Acts 16:9).58 Thus not only in form-critical structure but also in purpose and content the Matthean dreams are like those of the Elohist in Genesis. Some have called the Matthean dreams the lowest form of revela- tion found in Scripture,"5 while others have called them a 55 Jubilees, I Enoch, and Genesis Apocryphon. Cf. C.
