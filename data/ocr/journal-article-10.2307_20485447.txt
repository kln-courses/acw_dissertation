<plain_text><page sequence="1">Household Gods: A History of the British and Their Possessions, by Deborah Cohen (New Haven, CT: Yale U.P., 2006: pp. XVii + 296. ?25). Writing in I714, Joseph Addison described households in chaos, as wives exchanged their, and their husbands', clothes for china: 'I have known an old petticoat metamorphosed into a punch-bowl, and a pair of breeches into a tea pot'.' The imagined world was all the more chaotic because of the gender i.

In I882 the Hadley Porcelain Company produced the Aesthetic Teapot: an anthropomorphic delight in china, satirising Darwinism and aestheticism. The meaning of the foppish male aesthete donning a large sunflower on one side, and the rather manly woman on the other, were underscored by the motto on the base: 'Fearful consequences through the laws of Natural Selection and Evolution of living up to one's teapot'. As Deborah Cohen glosses, 'If there was anything worse than turning into a teapot, it was the collapse of sexual difference' (p. 82). The position of boundaries changes, but the deployment of objects in the construction of those boundaries endures. Some things never change. Decades of scholarship within and without the discipline of History have demonstrated the many ways in which identity is bound up with the material culture of space and things. Objects articulate-and, it might be argued, create-boundaries between in- and out-groups, between communities of people composed of classes, genders and nations. Objects achieve this in several ways, but one important process is the intersection of material objects and discourses of taste. Since at least the eighteenth century, ideas about taste have imbued styles with moral and ethical implications, and these ideas about taste have conditioned the nature, use and interpretation of objects. Cohen's wonderfully rich study examines how discourses of taste intersected with the production and consumption of domestic objects and spaces for the middle class in Britain between 1830 and 1930. This is an examination of what things meant and, crucially, how that changed. Cohen takes an historian's approach to things, one that engages more with the documentary contexts of objects than with the intricacies of production, design or materials. But, while the focus is on contemporary uses and interpretations of things, Cohen steps out of the well-worn tracks that historians of 'consumption' have laid down. Things are not just goods with a price or value; things are enchanted and possessed with meanings. '[R]ooms could be read like faces' (p. 140), Cohen writes, and she reads these domestic everyday interiors with wit and insight. The book draws on a very broad range of sources to explore the discourses but also the 'lived experience' (p. xvi) of middle-class consumers. Cohen is more concerned with mass manufacturing and the less remarkable commentaries on taste than she is with the advocates of 'high design'. In this way the book fits more assuredly into socio-cultural history than design history. Cohen's analysis also feeds into a chronological narrative. Chapter One, 'Material Good', describes how the British passion for their household possessions began in the mid-nineteenth century with the investment of things with moral qualities and the articulation of religiosity through the domestic interior (p. 30). With their consumption thus licensed, the middle class went shopping. Chapter Two, 'Cathedrals to Commerce', examines the lavish emporia that emerged at the turn of the century, focusing on the enticements to consumers therein. Chapter Three, 'Art at Home', demonstrates that interior decoration was once regarded as art, with 'lady advisors' playing as important a role as men such as John Ruskin and William Morris. Chapter Four, 'In Possession', neatly shows that men were actively engaged in interior decoration until the I920S and 1930S-Kitchener apparently had a talent for flower-arranging-but the home was gradually transformed into an expression of women's identity.

Some consumers resisted this modern relationship between home and personality (notably through the purchase of antiques, covered in Chapter Six, 'Designs on the Past'), but by the twentieth century the two had uncoupled: Chapter Seven, 'Modern Living', charts the resistance of British designers and consumers to modernism and the emergence of a culture of domestic decorative orthodoxy. What would a medievalist say to all this, I wonder? As an eighteenth-century historian, I am not convinced by Cohen's claim that the origins of modern British preoccupations with the material stuff of home lie in the century after 1830. Articulating religious feeling through domestic objects is a practice of some considerable vintage; discourses of taste have long rendered possessions as one index of moral fibre; and individuals have been able to learn and deploy such values since there have been discourses instantiating them. Yet some things certainly do change. Debates over luxury are long-standing, but the application of the term 'luxury' to pious work signalled something more than the use of objects to express religiosity: the language of design was now fused with the language of morality, as men of faith appropriated home decor as part of a Christian vision. The Macmillan series entitled 'Art at Home' was the brain-child of the Reverend W. J. Loftie, who was also the author of its first book published in 1876. A social and economic context that produced a consolidated and stable middle class was also new. This group remained small (I2.5% of the population in I85I, 25% in I90I, Cohen reports), but was increasing not just in size but also income. The group had considerable economic, political and cultural authority, and the statements made through their possessions were potent. I wanted to hear more about this, about the ways that the meanings of middle-class things worked in a broader context: what if you were outside the in-group, either as a recalcitrant middler yourself, or above or below on the social scale? It is partly in this context of the real power of middle-class things that we should view the battle for married women's property. Emmeline Pankhurst, founder of the Women's Social and Political Union, sought to build women's enfranchisement on the foundation of a series of four furnishing shops. This was 'a new domesticity, a more militant domesticity' (p. 105). There was also a world war. Cohen is clear that the trauma of the First World War produced simplicity and orthodoxy in style. Indeed, having demonstrated that the home was a stage for the individual personality, it is striking that the end of Cohen's story suggests the downgrading of goods (or perhaps of the self). By the 1930s, household possessions were used to express one's similarity with the neighbours. The Epilogue picks up the story in the I98os and I99os, taking in the home magazine House Beautiful and the TV series Changing Rooms, and reporting on the widespread belief in the "'blandification" of the British home' (p. 210). This closing discussion gives the book an accessible frame; it is certainly no less valuable for all that, being (as with the rest of the study) well researched. Yet the consumers in this final episode are surely not the modern equivalents of the earlier characters. Shoppers in Ikea do not occupy the same economic or socio-cultural position as visitors to Heal's furniture store a century before; indeed, I am not sure that those early visitors to Heal's would deign to speak to some of the visitors to the present Heal's store.

Household Gods should be rightly celebrated as part of the historical profession's interaction with a wider reading public. The narrative is painted with a broad brush and illustrated with wonderfully chosen fine detail. Specialists will no doubt pick over this detail, identifying omissions or over simplifications. Yet the book makes a significant contribution to academic debates about the home, middle-class culture, gender and identity. Scholars and students in a number of fields will find it to be an informative, important and engaging study. KAREN HARVEY doi:Io.o93/ehr/cenz9o University of Sheffield</page></plain_text>
