<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM By CURT ROSENOW, University of Kansas Many psychologists are strongly attracted to Behaviorism but hesitate to call themselves Behaviorists. In view of this situation, a discussion of the parts of the doctrine which attract us and of the parts which repel us should be worth while; for such a discussion must lead either to a broader definition of Be- haviorism or else to a definite break with it on the part of these sympathizers. It seems to me that all of us who sympathize with Behavior- ism at all are attracted by its emphasis on the study of behavior as a biological phenomenon and by its frank recognition of the sterility of the study of states of consciousness. There does not appear to be any one aspect which antagonizes all of us. I find it convenient to distinguish two, as follows. First, at least some of the findings of the introspectionist are accepted as 'states of consciousness' and it is felt to be unscientific to ignore facts, whatever their value; and, secondly, the mechanistic prejudice of the prominent exponents of Behaviorism is felt to be an un- necessary bias which prevents impartial observation and inter- pretation of the facts of behavior. In a recent article I presented a Behavioristic point of view which took account of the facts observed by the introspectionist, but not as states of consciousness, and which exhibited neither a mechanistic nor a vitalistic bias.1 In an even more recent arti- cle Lashley does accept the findings of introspection as 'states of consciousness' and attempts to show how such facts can be explained by a mechanistic Behaviorism.2 He attempts to meet the first of the objections stated above and gives the clearest and most systematic example of the second which it has been my good fortune to read. Accordingly I wish to discuss the parts of his doctrine which appear to me most inadequate in order to lead up to further discussion of the position taken by me in the ear- lier article. The positions of Lashley to which I object are these. First, I object to the statement that a complete description and explanation of behavior can be given in physico-chemical terms3. No one doubts that such knowledge as we have of the physics and chemistry of behavior is valuable scientific knowledge, and every scientist hopes to see this knowledge extended. But 'Behavior and Conscious Behavior, Psy. Rev., 30, I923, 192 ff. 2K. S. Lashley, The Behavioristic Interpretation of Consciousness, ibid., 30, I923, 237 ff. aOp. cit., 238. 233</page><page sequence="2">the dogmatic assertion that the principles of physics and chemistry will some day explain everything that is worth explaining is not only valueless, but, so far as it directs the attention of the investigator away from impor- tant facts which do not have the remotest connection with the known prin- ciples of physics and chemistry, it is vicious. Unfortunately the point is usually discussed under the heading 'Mechanism versus Vitalism', as if these two positions were the only ones possible. But there is a third position,- one of indifference to the problem. The typical argument between the vitalist and the mechanist proceeds about as follows. The vitalist chal- lenges: "You cannot explain (let us say) meaning." The mechanist replies with an hypothetical account of the physical events which take place when the phenomenon 'meaning' occurs. The vitalist rejoins: "That does not explain." The mechanist snaps back: "It does"; and there we are. It is obvious that the debaters have divergent views of the nature of explanation. The vitalist demands logical continuity; the mechanist replies with tem- poral correlation. The problem with which they are dealing can be cast into the following form. If we try to envisage the process of evolution with- in the categories of space and time, we have no difficulty in granting, in prin- ciple, the temporal and logical continuity of physical development. When meaning appears as an observable characteristic of behavior, the temporal continuity of its development from meaningless behavior can be under- stood, in principle, easily enough. But we are unable to see any logical con- tinuity, and this lack of understanding seems to us more than mere igno- rance of detail. At most (if the statement means anything) we can say that prior to the advent of meaning there existed the potentialities which made its evolution possible. But neither the physicist, nor Watson, nor Lashley, nor Bergson has been able to enlighten me about the nature of these poten- tialities. What follows from this inability to understand? So far as I can see, there follows-nothing, absolutely nothing. The sensible thing seems to be to abandon the problem. Meantime I find that I can observe and under- stand (in a measure) the growth and development of meaningful behavior and, inasmuch as these problems of growth and development interest me, I follow that path. That leads to my second objection. While I agree that the point of view of psychology should be biological, it does not follow that it should be mech- anistic. All branches of biology, including physiology and psychology, have their mechanists, vitalists, and those who are neither. Without attempting to draw a fine line between psychology and physiology, it seems to me that physiology is interested in every aspect of organic behavior, psychology chiefly in its meaning, if there is one. Thus the physics and chemistry of the phototropism are of interest to the physiologist, but the question what, if anything, Euglena means when it reacts to light,-that is, the question whether the phototropism presents a problem which can be called a psycho- logical problem,-that problem is excessively obscure. And it seems to me that one's position in psychology should not depend on the arbitrary solu- tion of an apparently insoluble problem. The case is quite otherwise when we consider human behavior. Here meaning rather than mechanism is of preponderating practical and psychological importance; and if Behavior- ism cannot deal with it, so much the worse for Behaviorism. We come here to the heart of the problem which Behaviorism must face, the problem of meaning. And my third and most serious objection to Lash- ley's position is that he relegates the description of meaning to Titchener's introspection4. Introspection, I shall try to show, is biased observation. The bias is a double one, and becomes particularly unfortunate when ap- plied to meaning. In the first place, introspection finds states of conscious- 40p. cit., 258 ff. "The fact is that meaning, on (ubjective analysis, re- duces to a succession of images accompanied by vague affects." ROSENOW 234</page><page sequence="3">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM ness where unbiased observation finds nothing of the kind. Whether a stone is regarded as a physical object or as a state of consciousness does not depend on the technique of observation, but on the bias of the observer. (Meantime the stone, or human behavior, can be described without raising the question.) In the second place, the introspectionist describes his states of consciousness from what Titchener calls the 'existential' point of view. That is, he is interested in what sensation 'is', not in what it means. And sensation, Titchener finds, is a sensory quale of a given duration and inten- sity. What then is meaning? Titchener answers and Lashley quotes ap- provingly: "An idea means another idea, is [emphasis mine] the meaning of that other idea, if it is that idea's context." And again: "Meaning is, originally, kinaebthesis." That is, one sensory quale means another sensory quale, 'is' the meaning of that other quale,-a kinaesthetic quale means a blue quale. Surely, neither Titchener's observation nor that of anyone else ever observed so weird a happening. The mere statement is almost a reductio ad absurdum of the introspective account of meaning. Now suppose that an individual untutored in introspection is asked to describe the nature of his thoughts. For the sake of simplicity suppose that he depends exclusively on kinaesthesis. After the initial misunderstandings have been cleared away, he may report that he feels either movement or strain of the lips, tongue, eyes, and other parts of the body. If then he is told that these are kinaesthetic sensations, he will have got as far as the average student of psychology ever gets in introspection. If however he perseveres in his ob- servations, he will learn to recognize some of these feelings of strain and movement as nascent acts in a way which will clarify the connection of the act with the meaning of the act. For example, the office of one of my col- leagues is to the left of mine. A frequent way I have of thinking of him is by going through the bare initial stages of leaving my office to go to his. The eyes tend to move to the left, and there is a slight change in the tonus of many muscles. There is nothing startling or new about such descrip- tions. What I wish to exphasize is that the direct observation of a meaningful act is as genuine and direct an observation as the 'introspection' of a mus- cular strain. To be sure, if I had not found the historical setting of the act, I might not have been able to observe its true character, and it might have remained a meaningless movement to me. But, in the same way, a child who never learns to read will never see anything but black marks on a white background. Learning to note kinaesthetic 'feels' is learning the alphabet of self-observation; learning to observe meaningful behavior is learning to read. Only a psychophysical bias coupled with an existential point of view can stop short of a more adequate account of meaning than is furnished by kinaesthetic sensations. That brings me to my fourth objection, which is that Lashley classes meaning with 'facts of consciousness' and accordingly considers it a sub- jective phenomenon. My position is that meaning is a characteristic of be- havior and is objective. Of course, the terms 'subjective' and 'objective' are notoriously obscure. Lashley says: "The subjective and objective descrip- tions are not descriptions from two essentially different points of view, . . but simply descriptions of the same thing with different degrees of accuracy and detail."5 Now I have attempted to show above that Titchen- er's account of meaning is inaccurate and lacks detail not because of the peculiar character of the phenomena observed, but because of the biased point of view of the observer. I have shown that neither the observation of 'external objects' nor self-observation yields facts of an order essentially different from the facts yielded by any possible technique of observation. From such a point of view the subjective does not exist except in the mind of the mechanist and the subjectivist. So far as the 'objectivity' of mean- sOp. Cit., 338. 235</page><page sequence="4">ROSENOW ing is concerned, the meaning of an act is often directly observable and at other times it can be inferred on the basis of direct observations. In either case the account is, in principle, verifiable. And observability and verifi- ability are all the objectivity that science needs. (A word should be said about the verification of an account of meaning. Verification is the presen- tation of verifiable evidence. Such evidence, aside from the description of the act itself, is the account of the historical facts which led up to it, and correct anticipation of the consequences. An example will be found below. But even though such evidence may convince the most sceptical, it will not constitute proof in the sense in which that term is used in exact science. And the reason for that will appear below also.) We may conclude this part of our discussion by considering Lashley's statement of the problem of psychology, as follows: "To find in the physi- cal world deterministic relations between nonqualitative [emphasis mine] discrete entities in time and space which fulfill certain conditions of relation- ship laid down by subjective evidence."6 It might be worth pointing out that receptors, neurones, or indeed any entities which are directly observ- able, have qualities. Evidently Lashley has electrons in mind and uses the body only because, to him, it is self-evident that the living organism is a physical thing and its behavior a physical process. Consequently the mean- ing of that behavior becomes 'subjective'. The reader's attention is directed chiefly to the logical connection between the physico-chemical bias and the subjectivity of meaning. The physico-chemical bias itself is not worth op- posing, because no living psychologists are actually at work at physico- chemical problems nor will they be in the near future. The actual explana- tions of the mechanistic Behaviorist are being given in physiological terms. And what I object to is not the physiological terminology, but the falsifica- tion of the observable so-called subjective facts. The chief problem of psychology, as I see it, is to give an adequate, correct, and verifiable account of the meaning of be- havior. The total problem of physiology and psychology has been stated adequately by Watson as that of prediction and con- trol of behavior. But he who understands the meaning of be- havior so far as seems possible will be able to predict and control human conduct in the vital problems in which Lashley professes interest far more adequately than he who knows all the physics, chemistry, and mechanistic physiology which we shall know for some time to come. At any rate, that is the path which has al- ways been taken by those who seek to understand and influence men and women in a practical way, and it is, in effect, the path taken by the psychiatrist and the psychoanalyst. Psychology as the science of a bodiless mind joined to a mindless body has contributed almost nothing, and a Behaviorism which attempts to explain meaning in terms of meaningless movements will not contribute more. Before Behaviorism can attack the genuine problems of the meaning of behavior it must clear out of its path the metaphysical problem which it has created for itself by in- sisting on the subjective (or epiphenomenal) character of mean- ing. The rest of this paper will be devoted to the discussion of 6Op. cit., 329. 236</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM behavior and meaning as facts, without asking or caring whether the facts are physical or mental, subjective or objective. In a previous paper I put forward the claim that meaningful behavior is a directly observable objective fact and that it should be the most fundamental and basic category of psychol- ogy. I supported that claim by description and discussion of various types of meaningful behavior by means of which I at- tempted to make this idea intelligible and plausible.7 Since that time various critical suggestions have reached me, three of which I mean to utilize in order to develop this idea further. (i) It was said that my treatment implies that the behavior of even the lowest forms of living organisms is meaningful or conscious be- havior; (2) it was pointed out that the absence of a definition of meaningful behavior weakened the article; (3) the statement was made that these theoretical views would mean more if it were shown what relation, if any, they have to the experimental work which is being done by psychologists. In what follows I shall assume that the reader is familiar with the former article. Taking up the first point, I start with the behavior of the human animal. It seems to me an indisputable fact that the meaning of human behavior is, at times, directly observable. The objection that the term 'meaning' is anthropomorphic seems ridiculous, so long as we confine ourselves to the descrip- tion of human behavior. How else is human behavior to be de- scribed, if not in terms which have evolved for that very pur- pose? When we come to the higher vertebrates it seems equally obvious that they see, hear, smell, fight, and engage in other forms of meaningful behavior analogous to human behavior. On the other hand it should be equally obvious that there are not- able differences between human and infrahuman behavior. But that is a question of detail which, with one exception, I did not discuss.8 And, so far as I can see, one is not under logical obli- gation to discuss such detail. But I deny categorically that any- thing whatever can be deduced regarding the behavior of pro- tozoa from the established fact that some human behavior is meaningful, except perhaps that the earliest forms of life were of such character as to make possible the subsequent evolution which as a matter of fact did take place. Such a statement is entirely different from the statement that the behavior of pro- tozoa is meaningful. And I deny that a solution of this problem is necessary to an adequate understanding of human conduct. Of course the issue ultimately involved at this point is a metaphysical one; and in 'Behavior and Conscious Behavior' I protested against the in- troduction of any metaphysical assumption into psychology. Weiss holds 'Behavior and Conscious Behavior, Psy. Rev., 30, 1923, I92 ff. 8The exception is that my discussion implied that only animals with well developed language-habits are capable of self-conscious behavior. 237</page><page sequence="6">ROSENOW that that amounts to a refusal to discuss fundamental issues;9 and, at the expense of a brief digression, I wish to discuss his point. So far as the re- fusal to discuss fundamentals is concerned, I had supposed that in discus- sing consciousness and behavior I was discussing fundamental ideas. But I do deny that an arbitrary solution of a metaphysical problem yields a sound foundation for a psychology which deals with the empirical facts of human behavior. The metaphysical foundation which Weiss has used may serve as another illustration. Weiss holds "that all human conduct and achievement reduces to nothing but: (a) different kinds of electron-proton groupings characterized according to geometrical structure; (b) the motions that occur when one structural or dynamic form changes into another." Accordingly the in- dividual is an electron-proton aggregate and a function (in the mathematical sense) of the changes that are occurring in all other electron-proton aggre- gates.10 That is the foundation. Then Weiss proceeds to classify the acts of individuals as (I) biophysical, i. e., anatomically and physiologically similar acts, and (2) biosocial acts, which are socially equivalent because they release socially similar responses in others. Thus various ways of ac- cepting an invitation are socially equivalent if they would be responded to in practically the same fashion by the one who extended the invitation. That is the psychological superstructure built upon the metaphysical foun- dation. Now the superstructure is not deducible from the foundation nor does it have any logical connection of any kind with that foundation. No arguments either for or against the accuracy, utility, or significance of Weiss' dual classification can be drawn from his electro-proton hypothesis. The classification, separated from its metaphysics, could be accepted without modification regardless of one's theory of reality. In fine, the metaphysical foundation of Weiss, far from being fundamental, is irrelevant to the rest of his psychology. I come now to the fact that my former article lacked a formal definition of meaningful behavior. Every science, so far as its structure is logical and systematic, has at its foundations a set of undefined terms and unproved assumptions about these terms. Inasmuch as I believe that the term 'meaningful behavior' should be one of the fundamentals of psychology, I cannot define it by reducing it to simpler terms. To do so would be tanta- mount to the admission that these simpler terms are themselves the real fundamentals. Nevertheless it would be unwarranted to throw the term at the reader without an attempt to make clear to him the nature of the concrete phenomena which it de- notes to me. Logically I should be perfectly justified in using an undefined term and making assumptions about that term, but psychologically such procedure would leave the term abstract, empty, and without relation to concrete experience. Conse- quently I have tried to point at, describe, and discuss the con- crete phenomena which the term denotes to me. For example, in 'Behavior and Conscious Behavior,' I have discussed the be- havior of seeing as one of the phenomena which the term denotes. Also I have discussed the alleged fact (logically, the unproved 9A. P. Weiss, Behavior and Behaviorism, Psy. Rev., 3I, 1924, 35. 'o Op. cit., 39. 238</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM assumption) that the acting organism is not always aware of the meaning of its meaningful acts. In the rest of this article I shall offer additional description and discussion. In lieu of a formal definition, which, as I have shown, is logically impossible, I shall make a brief statement intended to sum up the discussion of the former article as well as the discussion which is to follow in this article. No other 'definition' of a fundamental idea is logically possible. When a psychologist studies a human being for the purpose of understanding him and his behavior, he arrives after a time at what he believes to be a true statement of the environment of this individual or as near to such a statement as is possible. At the same time he recognizes (or should recognize) that the en- vironment as experienced by the observed individual is more or less different from the environment experienced by the observer. In order to understand the individual the observer endeavors (or should endeavor) to make clear to himself the nature of the environment as experienced by the individual. As a matter of definition, I shall call the environment as experienced by the ob- server the true environment, or briefly the environment, and I shall call the environment as experienced by the observed individ- ual the experienced situation, or briefly the situation, and the two terms will be used in this sense throughout this article. I am now ready to make a brief statement to take the place of a formal definition of the term 'meaningful behavior'. By means of meaningful behavior the organism enters into relations with its environment.1l Each relation is at one and the same time the behavior of experiencing a situation and the behavior of acting with reference to the experienced situation. By definition, the behavior of acting with reference to a situation and the behavior of experiencing that situation is a single phenomenon; the behavior of acting with reference to a situation is the behavior of exper- iencing that situation. A concrete illustration would be an in- dividual who establishes a relation with an environment consist- ing in part of a white sheet by seeing a ghost. By means of 'see- ing-the-ghost' the organism enters into a relation with its envi- ronment; seeing-the-ghost is the behavior of experiencing the ghost; seeing-the-ghost not only leads to further behavior with reference to the ghost, but is itself behavior with reference to the ghost. Let us now discuss this definition. So far as the environment is concerned, the psychologist should describe it as he sees it after mature deliberation. If he views it as an electron-proton ag- gregate he should describe it in that way (without much detail, "These relations which the organism enters into are by no means the only relations of the organism to the environment which can be observed. 239</page><page sequence="8">I fear). But I insist that he should not let his view of the envi- ronment falsify his description of the situation. If I saw a ghost, it does not describe the situation to say that I saw a white sheet hanging from a clothes-line.12 Again, I have asserted that the meaningful act is at one and the same time a mode of experiencing and a mode of acting. In other words, I assert that the distinction between awareness and action is valid logically, but invalid phenomenologically. The distinction has arisen because in the practical exigencies of life we usually describe what we have experienced, not our modes or experiencing,-we discuss what we have seen, not the behavior of seeing. The distinction is valid and useful, just as the dis- tinction between the pitch and the intensity of a sound is valid and useful even though the two are inseparable aspects of a sin- gle phenomenon. But, considering the meaningful act as a con- crete phenomenon, awareness and activity are inseparable. The distinction rests upon an analysis of language and the fallacy arises because terms such as seeing, fearing, and shrinking, which should denote partial aspects of single unitary activities, are taken to denote separate activities. Seeing is (by definition) the immediate automatic response by means of which the organism establishes relations with the environment via the retina, not with or to the retina. And all of this response, the visceral part as well as the part played by the striped muscles and by the eye, is the act of seeing. For, by definition, the organism does not re- spond to a stimulation of the sense-organ, but the sense-organ is a part of the organism which reacts to the environment. Terms such as seeing, hearing, etc., as used ordinarily, denote the part played in such reactions by the sense-organ and connote the sensory quale of the experienced situation; terms such as shrink- ing, cowering, running, striking, etc., denote primarily the part played by the skeletal muscles without specific connotation re- garding the qualitative character of the situation with reference to which the act takes place; and the emotional terms of non- technical language are more or less vague both as to the sensory quale of the situation and as to the part played by the effectors in the response. But shrinking from danger is an act which takes place via some sense-organ, not to a sense-organ, and the emo- tional quale is as truly perceived as part of the experienced situa- "2We may note in passing that if I see a ghost I do not necessarily ob- serve myself seeing the ghost, but the observer necessarily does so. We need not therefore debate the question whether the self is a 'content of con- sciousness'. In observing the conduct of an organism one necessarily ob- serves the organism, and that is true also when the organism observes its own conduct. Accordingly the classical problem of the self as content re- duces to the problem of the meaning of the word 'I (or some equivalent) in various situations. 240 ROSENOW</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM tion as is the sensory quale. In certain instances, and for practi- cal purposes, it is legitimate enough to speak of first seeing danger and then shrinking from it; but a careful psychological statement should state that the activity of experiencing a situa- tion to be shrunk from by means of the behavior of shrinking from it is preceded by the activity of experiencing a somewhat different situation, e. g., a situation to be investigated anxiously, by means of the behavior of investigating it anxiously. As the behavior changes, so the situation changes. Ordinary language, legitimately enough, denotes the earlier situation by the general term danger, which means a situation which can be responded to in a variety of ways without designating the specific ways which actually are occurring. I wish to emphasize once more that it is the behavior of ex- periencing-a-situation which constitutes the relation of the or- ganism to its environment. The situation is what it is only by virtue of being experienced in that way. Consequently any at- tempt to describe this relation must include not only an account of the behavior of experiencing but also an account of what is ex- perienced. Seeing-a-ghost is a single unitary phenomenon. The seeing cannot be abstracted from the ghost except as length is abstracted from width. Neither has phenomenological exist- ence except as a characteristic of a phenomenon. Before attempting to discuss more at length the way in which meaningful behavior means its stimulus or situation, I wish to review certain other general characteristics of meaningful be- havior. In ordinary usage the word meaning is used to indicate (i) a characteristic of experience, and (2) a characteristic of be- havior. Frequently the two usages are interchangeable. Thus I may speak of perceiving a threatening cloud or of meaning to seek shelter. But in either case my relation to the environment is my meaningful behavior toward it; and when the state of affairs is envisaged in that way the problem of the locus of mean- ing is solved. It is the relation of the organism to its environment which means. Consequently I have argued that the psychologist should deal with meaning only as a characteristic of behavior; and that is the usage adopted in this paper.13 Again, the idea of meaningful behavior has something in com- mon with an idea in good repute with the physicist, viz., the idea of motion. No matter how far we push the process of ab- straction, we cannot abstract the ideas of time and direction away from either. If we do, there is left neither motion nor be- havior. The motion of a body or the behavior of an organism is not a thing which 'is'; it is an event which happens. It is in its very essence historical and cannot be understood without refer- '3Cf. Behavior and Conscious Behavior, 211 ff. 24I</page><page sequence="10">ROSENOW ence to its history. There are times when the relevant history of a moving body can be perceived in a fraction of a second suffi- ciently well to determine the direction of the movement with an accuracy which suffices for practical purposes. The same thing is true of the meaning of acts. At other times extended obser- vation and a process of inference may be necessary to determine the direction of the one or the meaning of the other. Beyond this point, however, the analogy ceases to hold; for the direc- tion of a movement can be computed with absolute accuracy (in theory), whereas it is frequently impossible, even in theory, to state the meaning of an act with as much rational clearness as might be desirable. This difficulty will be discussed further presently. Again, in 'Behavior and Conscious Behavior' I cited G. H. Mead to the effect that the gesture is an unfinished social act which means the completed act. Thus the beginning of an at- tack is perceived as the beginning of an attack, not as a movement the meaning of which must be inferred. I wish to make two ad- ditions. In the first place, the beginning of an attack is what it is whether or not it has been correctly perceived at the time of its occurrence. In the second place, an unfinished act need not be a social act in order to mean whatever it means. In any case, the meaning of an unfinished act can be stated adequately only with reference to the total act of which it is the beginning. Ac- cordingly Mead's formula is applicable to all kinds of acts, social and non-social.14 In order to illustrate and elaborate these points, let us examine first a simple form of behavior and then a complicated case. The picking up of a pencil will do for the simple form. Usually that will be part of a larger ac- tivity, such as the jotting down of a memorandum which in turn is noted for some purpose or other; but let us neglect that. An account of the mean- ing of this act is given by the common-sense description, viz., picking up a pencil. But it is worth noting that that meaning is not a static fact or re- lation; that it progresses as the act progresses; and when the activity comes to an end, the meaning ceases, just as motion ceases when a moving body comes to rest. A completed act does not mean,-it has meant. If, however, the act is interrupted before completion, the incomplete act can be described adequately only with reference to what the act would have been, if it had not been interrupted, for up to the moment of interruption the act meant just that.'6 "We must be careful however to distinguish the consequences of the act from the meaning of the act. For example, the sitting hen does not mean to hatch chicks, and the human animal not infrequently does not mean to become a parent. The distinction can be made on the basis of relevant evi- dence and it is the task of the psychologist to find such evidence. 6In order to ward off a misunderstanding which occurred in the case of a critic who saw this paper in advance of publication, let me say that the discovery of what a completed act has meant may be as important psycho- logically as finding what an incomplete act has meant or means while it is occurring. Thus an homicide might be described as a completed act by a 242</page><page sequence="11">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM Our illustration of a simple meaningful act has been reasonably clear, if we do not deprive ourselves of common sense in the interest of a mechanistic bias. It must be borne in mind, however, that a part of this clarity was achieved by abstracting a trivial act from its larger setting. A concrete act is never merely the picking up of a pencil; and if we had taken a larger set- ting into account, a precise and exhaustive account of meaning would not have been possible. Let us therefore examine a complex case. Some years ago I was consulted by a patient who suffered from attacks of tachycardia for which no organic cause could be found. He had been told by physicians that his case was 'mental'. Assuming the medical findings to be correct, the rapid heart-action could be nothing but one of the phenomena of strong emotion, but that told me neither the nature of the emotion nor its occasion. A study of the life-history obtained from the patient himself revealed a his- tory of partial failures in business and of misadventures in love. At the time he came to me he was engaged in an important undertaking the out- come of which seemed doubtful to him. I concluded that he had lost con- fidence in himself, was afraid that he was going to fail in the undertaking in which he was engaged, and feared that he would make a failure of life. At certain times this fear degenerated into panic, and that, I concluded, was the tachycardia. Of course, the patient did not admit all this to himself. As a matter of fact, the immediate problem which confronted him was not diffi- cult, and there was no reason why he should not look forward to a success- ful issue with confidence. Without attempting to explain the tachycardia to him, I succeeded in instilling a little confidence into him (perhaps only temporarily) and the tachycardia disappeared. That is a common-sense account of the case. I shall attempt now to deal more adequately with the concrete meaningful behavior as it actually occurred. The behavior in question is, of course, not merely the tachycardia but the total behavior of which that was a part. I have said that the meaning of an incomplete act can be described only by describing the total act of which it is the beginning. If we regard the rapid heart-action as the beginning of an activity, our problem is to de- scribe the rest of the act, i. e., what would have happened if the act had been completed. In the first place and in part, the tachycardia was the beginning of an attempt to escape, by means of running, in the literal 'physical' sense, from a fearful situation.16 That act, of course, was irrational; but emotion- al reactions frequently are. Our subsequent analysis will not and should not make the meaning of the actual act more rational, but it should make more intelligible the fact that in spite of its vagueness and irrationality the act had a more or less definite meaning. The tachycardia, then, was not only an initial stage of running away, but it was also an integral part of the act of perceiving a fearful situation. In 'Behavior and Conscious Behavior' I tried to show that perceiving is a form of behavior, that we perceive not only actualities, but possibilities and probabilities, and that such perceiving is the occurrence of more or less automatic and habitual forms of meaningful behavior. These principles will make the tachycardia more intelligible. In perceiving we perceive not only objects, but total situations. Conventional poychology has made a sharp distinction between cognitive and affective states of consciousness and has, arbitrarily, abstracted all affective factors from the 'percept'. But if we attempt to study perceiving as meaningful mechanistic Behaviorist without taking account of the meaning of the act, but from the point of view of the law and of common sense such a descrip- tion would be highly inadequate. If, for example, the individual who com- mitted the homicide meant to preserve his life, the meaning of this com- pleted act would be highly relevant. 6As a matter of fact these attacks usually came on after dark, and the patient would rush out for long walks. 243</page><page sequence="12">behavior we cannot afford to follow this line of cleavage. If, as I have sug- gested, we perceive with our muscles and glands as well as with our sense- organs, then the heart and the viscera can enter into the behavior of per- ceiving as well as the striped muscles. If perceiving is in any sense a total reaction of the organism, then the fact that there has not been an important change in visceral activity does not mean that these visceral activities are not a part of perceiving, but that the behavior of perceiving has not been modified so far as visceral activities are concerned. An illustration would be the calm perceiving of a dangerous situation as contrasted with the per- ceiving of a fearful situation. In the second case we do not have the cog- nition of danger plus the emotion of fear, but we have the perceiving of a terrifying situation. The visceral behavior is not the response to a fearful situation, but a situation is perceived as fearful because part of the response is a change in visceral activity. Of course, the self-conscious human adult can, and sometimes does, give his attention to his own behavior of fearing; but no doubt all of my readers will recall situations which looked, sounded, or felt tense or ominous or ridiculous or the like in a way which will make them realize that such descriptions are not mere figures of speech, but ac- curate descriptions of concrete experiences. In such situations possibilities and probabilities are perceived, not thought of. To be sure, the perception is vague, and when we attempt a description of these perceived possibilities and probabilities in verbal terms we find the task extremely difficult. Nev- ertheless there occurs in such situations more than 'a pointing from nothing to nothing',"7 and it is the task of the psychologist to give a rational ac- count of such irrational behavior. As I have said and as we shall see, that can be accomplished by viewing the behavior as an historical event with a past and a future. In consequence, then, of certain developments in his affairs our tachy- cardia patient perceived a terrifying situation. Let us suppose that he be- came acquainted with these developments through reading a letter. The response was in part visceral and persisted after the letter had been read and he had stopped thinking about it. As I have suggested, we have at all times an appreciation of the emotional aspects of our situation. Thus the individual who is grieving tastes bitter, tasteless, or revolting food, breathes an oppressive atmosphere, thinks depressive thoughts, and the like. With it all there is a constant (usually unobserved) tendency to escape from the sad situation. In the same way our patient continued to experience a fear- ful situation long after he had stopped thinking about it. Occasionally the visceral part of the activity became intensified into tachycardia. For the physiological details of the visceral reaction we may accept the 'rather probable guesses' of the typical Behaviorist; for its meaning we shall consult its history. On a number of previous occasions in his life my patient had experienced 'unfavorable developments'. In each case the re- action had been partly visceral.. Probably, at first, the visceral reaction did not persist. But on each,occasion his fears had proved to be justified; fail- ure had ensued. So on subsequent occasions his visceral reactions became more persistent, and more definitely meaningful. And they meant what his past experience had taught, viz., failure. The details of the failure were foreseen only so far as they were foreseen, i. e., so far as he brought them to his own attention by means of overt or nascent gestures. Apparently very little of such foreseeing took place. The behavior was largely non-social and non-gestural. The probability of failure was not recognized as such; it was not thought of in that way; it was not known. The best possible way of describing the phenomenon is to say that the individual feared fail- ure. If the patient had said "I fear failure," no one would deny that his 17Cf. K. S. Lashley, The Behavioristic Interpretation of Consciousness, Psy. Rev., 30, 1923, 258. 244 ROSENOW</page><page sequence="13">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM verbal behavior meant what it did mean. All I claim is that the statement would have been true, if he had made it. And the fact that he failed to per- ceive the meaning of his own behavior should not prevent our doing so. But neither the acting individual nor any one else can ever know in precise, ac- curate detail what an emotional reaction means, because it does not mean accurate and precise detail. It is not that kind of behavior. It is, essentially, a vague perceptual summing up of past experience.l8 The description of such situations and of such meaningful behavior can- not be given, at the present time, in the technical terms of any of the sci- ences. Certainly neither the sensations and affects of conventional psy- chology nor the vocabulary which Behaviorism has borrowed from physi- ology will serve. At the present time the only language which is adequate is the non-technical language of highly cultured nations, presumably be- cause this vocabulary has been developed by individuals who, unlike the psychologist, have faced the real problems of human life. A usable term- inology has been developed by Freud,-usable, because many of his terms sum up lengthy description of observable characteristics of human behavior into single terms. But the Freudian vocabulary is objectionable because it substitutes false rationalizations for vague meanings. Take for example the 'Oedipus complex'. Freud is right when he claims that marital unhap- piness comes back in certain typical cases to the love of the wife for her Pather. But as a rule he is mistaken when he claims that this love is an un- conscious desire for sexual union with the father. A young woman who has been petted, protected, humored, and treated as a lovable but irresponsible child by her father up to the day of her marriage, and who has enjoyed being treated in this fashion, is not likely to be happy with a husband who treats her as a responsible adult. Such a woman may love her father and be un- happy with her husband. But the important factor is a (more or less) vague dissatisfaction with the present situation and a (more or less) vague longing for a return to the earlier satisfying situation. There is no unconscious de- sire. The behavior means-is-the beginning of the act of leaving the hus- band to return to the father. Suppose now that we were able to make a complete physiological analy- sis of the complex forms of behavior which we have been discussing. Very likely such an analysis would throw additional light on the cases, but for such light we must await the progress of physiology. Certainly the 'rather probable guesses' which Lashley feels he can make are not serviceable. For when Lashley says that "he is hungry and purposes to have beefsteak and onions for dinner" these words are not, as he claims, merely accepted names for the fact that certain physiological changes are occurring.l9 In that sense they are accepted only by a small (and mistaken) group of Behavior- ists. By the rest of us they are accepted 'names' for what he means to do. That is, they give us the meaning of the behavior which he attempts to de- scribe in physiological terms. But if the psychologist knows the meaning of behavior, he can dispense with rather probable guesses about its physiology. I do not mean to say that physiological observations cannot give us valuable hints about the meaning of behavior. Recent work on the physiology of deception illustrates how physiology can help psychology. I do affirm that Lashley is putting the cart before the horse when he says that the aim of I8Half the difficulties of psychology result from our unsuccessful attempts to force the description of vague meanings into the verbal categories evolved by logicians and the disciples of exact science. But what is vague 'is' vague. And so long as science remains the attempt to find out what actually occurs, so long will science reject the false simplifications of the mechanist and the equally false rationalizations of the teleologist. lOp. cit., 350. 245</page><page sequence="14">ROSENOW self-observation should be the discovery of cues to physiological problems.20 Physiological technique is of service to psychology because it enables us to observe details of behavior ordinarily hidden from view, not because it gives us the objective correlates of subjective facts. I come now to my last topic,-the bearing which the views expressed in 'Behavior and Conscious Behavior' and in the pres- ent paper have on experimental technique. First let me ask: "What has experimental psychology contributed to the inter- pretation of such cases as our tachycardia case?" So far as I can see, one does not need to be a psychologist or Behaviorist in or- der to understand that repeated failure is likely to discourage the individual more or less permanently; that failure in impor- tant undertakings is more likely to have this effect than failure in trivial affairs; and that business and love are two of the most important affairs in which men engage. With a history of such failures before one, one should look for signs of discouragement and fear. Nevertheless the ordinary cultured individual is not likely to arrive at a correct interpretation of such a case. The ordinary individual does not make it his special business to in- terpret human behavior except so far as seems necessary to carry on his own affairs. He takes account of the point of view of the other individual only in order to effect a sale, make a good im- pression, or even in order to win friendship or love. But, in the first place, many of us do not attempt to understand others even where it would be plainly to our advantage to do so. And, in the second place, even when we do so we seek a means to an end, not an end in itself. Accordingly an utterly inadequate amount of time and energy is devoted to the task of attempting to under- stand others. Obviously, the man whose chief interest is to reach an understanding of human conduct, who brings to bear all his knowledge and experience upon this single task, and who pursues this end even when he is not confronted by an immediate problem, will have an advantage over the ordinary cultured in- dividual whose main interests lie elsewhere. On the other hand, it is a question which can be raised in all fairness whether the laboratory psychologist is really interested in human conduct in this vital way. Most of us have come to see that analysis of states of consciousness into sensations and affects does not lead in that direction. I have attempted to show that analysis of human behavior into meaningless physiological components is predestined to be equally futile. And whatever connection with sterile theory the fact may have, it is a fact that the human be- havior studied by our experimentalists is trivial behavior studied under artificial conditions. The individual, as such, does not 20"Its (introspection's) avowed aim must be the discovery of cues to physiological problems"; op. cit., 352. 246</page><page sequence="15">THE PROBLEM OF MEANING IN BEHAVIORISM concern the experimentalist. He experiments with 'subjects,' not with individuals. Individual histories and individual prob- lems are unknown and do not enter into laboratory problems. Frankly, I cannot see that the laboratory work that has been done since the beginning of experimental psychology has added materially to our understanding of human conduct, nor has there resulted from it any considerable advance in psychological the- ory. We have advanced, but the advance has been due to more accurate and less biased self-observation, to the advance of biol- ogy, to the spread of knowledge about and the increase of thoughtful consideration of our major social problems, to better and more accurate knowledge of the behavior and conditions of other times and other races, and to the observations of workers in fields on the outskirts of academic psychology, such as 'mental' disease, crime, and the like.2' If our experimentalists would care less about making psychology an 'objective science' and more about contributing to the facts from which progress has come and will come, they would join the other workers who observe the human animal in its natural habitat. The important be- havior-patterns of human beings are social through and through. Any considerable increase in our knowledge of the formation and meaning of these patterns can come only through the study of the actual formation and functioning of these patterns and of the actual conditions under which they are formed. The home, the school, the church, court, factory, office, shop, etc., are the workshop of the psychologist. For science is not playing with apparatus in the laboratory, but the search after truth. In conclusion and by way of brief summary, I shall enumer- ate what seem to me to be the essential positions of this paper, as follows. (i) I have tried to show that a mechanistic Behaviorism can- not deal with meaning because meaning is not a mechanistic category. Lashley in particular attempts to meet this difficulty by adopting a quasi-dualistic position, and solves his problem by finding the physiological correlates of the sensations and images into which meaning is resolved by introspection. But technical introspection (from the 'existential point of view') attempts to resolve the dynamic fact of meaning into static components and accordingly must fail. 2"Psychology has made a genuine contribution to the understanding of the human individual in the mental test, but this advance has come as an extension and adaptation of the old-fashioned pedagogical examination, not as a development of the laboratory experiment. But lack of space and time forbids an adequate discussion of this topic. 247</page><page sequence="16">ROSENOW (2) I have held that meaning is the differentia which distin- guishes human behavior and the behavior of some animals from the behavior of inanimate objects, and that meaningful behavior should be one of the fundamental categories of psychology. (3) I have shown that a fundamental category cannot be de- fined by analysis into simpler categories, and that it is possible to define such a category only by means of description. Such a description of the meaningful act has been given in as general terms as possible. (4) I hold that the meaning of an act is at times evident to direct observation and is accordingly an objective fact. At other times the meaning of an act can be inferred from the his- tory of the act. (5) I hold that the meaning of a concrete, specific, human act is essentially more or less vague, but that nevertheless it is frequently describable with sufficient accuracy for the purpose of a truthful and useful description. In order to make the last two points, a concrete illustration was considered necessary. (6) I have replied to the criticism that the views expressed in this and in a former paper have no bearing on the work of the experimentalist by alleging that the present-day experimentalist does not deal with the important concrete facts of human life. The clinician who does deal with such facts will, I trust, find these ideas useful. 248</page></plain_text>
