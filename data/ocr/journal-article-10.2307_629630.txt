This number of DOP contains ten articles, besides a short biography and a bibliography of the late Robert Pierpont Blake, to whose memory the volume is dedicated. Professor Alphonse Dain, in an article called La transmission des textes littdraires classiques de Photius a Constantin Porphyrogeinte (pp. 31-47), studies the transliteration into minuscule and the editing of classical texts from the middle of the ninth to the end of the tenth cen- turies. The study is rightly made against its historical back- ground. The secular university of Bardas Caesar (856-866) and of Constantine VII (944-959) promoted the centralisation in Constantinople of classical texts and their reproduction. First came philosophical and rhetorical works, next historical, and lastly, in the second half of the tenth century, poetical. (This is no doubt the evidence of surviving MSS.; but we must add that we have excellent evidence that the poets, especially Euripides, were studied by a section of society at least as early as the beginning of the tenth century.) The article is also valuable in bringing to light the preparatory work done in the collection of material even before Photius (who became patriarch in 858, not 857) by such scholars as John the Gram- marian (who was deposed in 843, not 844). In a long, admirably documented, and absorbingly interest- ing study (The Cult of Images before Iconoclasm, pp. 85-150), Professor Ernst Kitzinger traces the intensification of the super- stitious reverence paid to wonder-working icons between the middle of the sixth century and the iconoclastic reaction in the second quarter of the eighth. Of the fact, no one who has read K.'s article can entertain any doubt. The reasons are, as he .admits, not so clear. The doctrinal importance, underlined by the Trullan Synod, of illustrating the Incarnation through anthropomorphic representations of Jesus Christ; the deliber- ate policy of the secular rulers of a collapsing world empire in shifting emphasis from an universal prince to the ' Onely Ruler of Princes': these appear merely as motives for the official encouragement of a tendency essentially and profoundly popular. The whole history of the Iconoclastic movement is an object lesson in how little can be done, even by the most absolute authority, to change the instinctive beliefs of a populace. And the general tendency towards obscurantism from the later sixth century onwards may be regarded, in the broader view, as but one more symptom of the death of the Ancient World, a phenomenon which led Bacon to describe Justinian I as the last of the Romans, and Ostrogorsky to see in the Heraclian age the beginning of Byzantine history properly so denominated. Professor S. Der Nersessian publishes (pp. 203-24) an inter- esting Armenian version of the 'Harrowing of Hell', from a fourteenth-century MS. in the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The version shows many points of similarity with Greek homilies on the same subject ascribed to Eusebius (? of Alexandria; ? sixth century), but in their surviving form probably not older than the eighth century. The Armenian version may rest on an earlier Greek tradition. The author promises publication of other Armenian homiletic texts, hitherto equally unknown. Notable among other contributions are the publication of an elegant liturgical Roll of the eleventh century, now in the Greek Patriarchate of Jerusalem, by Professor Andre Grabar; and a very lucid account of the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople (1204-61), together with some hitherto unpublished letters of Pope Honorius III, by Professor Robert Lee Wolff.
