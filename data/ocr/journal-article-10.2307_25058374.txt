At that time Enewetak was simply a ring of coral around the fringe of a sinking island mountain. Able to live only near the ocean's surface, however, corals build upon previous generations of coral structure as their land base sinks, and in the case of Enewetak this process continued long after the mountain's peak first submerged. Today Enewetak Atoll rises above the original mountain seven-tenths of a mile (two-and-a-half times the height of the Chicago Sears Tower) before it reaches its apex in a circle of lagoon islands on the ocean's surface. Darwin's presentation of the subsidence theory in The Voyage of the Beagle was the occasion of the following reflection. First, nature's art looms larger than that created by humans, and then this image is followed by a quieter thought concerning the invisibility of the object in question: We feel surprise when travellers tell us of the vast dimensions of the Pyramids and other great ruins, but how utterly insignificant are the greatest of these, when compared to these moun tains of stone accumulated by the agency of various minute and tender animals! This is a wonder which does not at first strike the eye of the body, but, after reflection, the eye of reason. (Voyage 464) The "eye of reason" was required to imagine coral mountains, certainly, because they were invisible to the "eye of the body." But the inadequacy of vision to this task involved more than the inability to see under the surface. Just as Darwin later had to present an evolutionary nature that was structured too intricately and changed too gradually to see, here also his task was to make an invisible process visible. Or, rather, the natural object itself could only be seen properly through a narrative of formation: 67</page><page sequence="2">68 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE The organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of lime, one by one, from the foaming breakers, and unite them into a symmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its thousand huge fragments; yet what will that tell against the accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day, month after month? (Voyage 459) Darwin's eye of scientific reason imagines and narrates a story made up of minute, particular acts and their accumulation into mountains of stone. Moments like these involving an imaginative reach ? and the sense of wonder it evokes ? occur for Darwin "after reflection." The perception is itself a culmination of a process. To view atolls scientifically he must first hypothesize particular acts ("organic forces separate the atoms . . . one by one"), encompass a great number of these into a single action ("myriads of architects at work night and day"), and then "accumulate" into one event and one object this collective labor that occurs over a geological period of time. I will argue in the first instance that this discourse of the sublime in Charles Darwin's writing represents more than a literary mode of expression for scientific ideas. The sublime is constitutive of those ideas themselves. What the theories argue as real, the sublime constructs and presents, and thus Darwin's sublime is discourse in which literature and science truly converge.1 Immanuel Kant's idea of the mathematical sublime will first serve me as a useful model for analyzing the Darwinian sublime ? a work of comparison that must also indicate the significant differences between these two writers' uses of the tradi tion along with their similarities. Specifically, in his mature evolutionary theory, Darwin uses the sublime to perform a negative, displacing function typical of Victorian realism. In this case it is deployed against the anthropomorphic trope of the interpretable or readable "face of nature," a hermeneutic that Darwin attributed to natural theologians, among others, and one he sought to replace with a different mode of observation. Positively, his discourse of the sublime is an act of the imagination through which he projected a sense of nature's ecological complexity that was otherwise unavailable to him. Persuasive and inventive, the sublime of the Origin is also therefore constitutively scientific, for it is essential to the idea of natural selection. The sublime constructs that uniquely Darwinian reality: the infinitely complex web of dynamic relations that produces evolutionary change. Analyzing the Sublime: Reason's Eye In Kant and Darwin In the science of coral reef formation, the sublime arises when a (practically) infinite series of particulars must be compressed into a single idea in order to represent, for example, an atoll. Darwin's sublime typically reaches for a group of particulars that is both synchronie and diachronic. Imagining "myriads of architects at work" gathers together a large number of actions into any present moment, and yet this activity must also be seen diachronically to suggest a geological history. Darwin's "mountain of stone" is thus the imaginative site of a virtual infinity of past and present activity. The sequentiality characteristic of such an act of imagination can serve as a first point of comparison with Kant's mathematical sublime. Consider Kant's discussion of viewing a pyramid: In order to get the full emotional effect from the magnitude of the pyramids one must neither get too close to them nor stay too far away. For if one stays too far away, then the appre</page><page sequence="3">Darwin's uEye of Reason" 69 hended parts (the stones on top of one another) are presented only obscurely, and hence their presentation has no effect on the subject's aesthetic judgment; and if one gets too close, then the eye needs some time to complete the apprehension from the base to the peak, but during that time some of the earlier parts are invariably extinguished in the imagination before it has apprehended the later ones, and hence the comprehension is never complete. (108) Here Kant's requirement for experiencing the mathematical sublime is that the mind be able both to apprehend sequentially the parts of the object and yet also attempt a comprehension of the whole. "The imagination must perform two acts: apprehen sion . . . and comprehension" (108). Apprehension is additive or mathematical: it pro ceeds sequentially from one part of the object to another. Apprehension involves no problem, for it may progress to infinity. But comprehension becomes more and more difficult the farther apprehension progresses, and it soon reaches its maximum_For when apprehension has reached the point where the partial presentations of sensible intuition that were first apprehended are already beginning to be extinguished in the imagination, as it proceeds to apprehend further ones, the imagination then loses as much on the one side as it gains on the other; and so there is a maximum in comprehension that it cannot exceed. (108) Kant adds that our imagination nevertheless "strives to progress toward infinity" and our reason urges us to comprehend the object: "reason demands absolute totality as a real idea." But of course our imagination is then "inadequate to that idea." (106). At this point in his analysis of the pleasurable experience of the sublime, Kant explains its pleasure by reference to a position that Darwin would have carefully eliminated from his own world view, namely the transcendence of reason. For Kant it is the very inadequacy of our imagination to reason's need to comprehend an "absolutely large" idea that is itself the arousal in us of the "feeling that we have within us a supersensible power" (106). With this presupposition Kant argues that what is sublime is not the "object" of our perception, "but the attunement that the intellect gets through a certain presentation" (106). Darwin also asks his readers to apprehend imagined elements sequentially, whether they be moments in a geological process or descriptions of ecological relations. And he, too, in the characteristic moment of the sublime, asks them to accumulate and compre hend what large groups of these elements present in their totality ? even as he emphasizes the impossibility of such a totalizing view. For Darwin (and here at the rhetorical level is one of his crucial differences from Kant) the impossibility of the totalizing view is directed at increasing our wonder at the minute particularity, the regionally specific complexity, and the subtle, moment-by-moment temporality of which nature is composed. Kant distinguishes between apprehension of sequential events or items in a series and the doomed effort at comprehension of that entire series. Similarly, but putting it in narratological terms, Darwin's effort to apprehend sequentially the actual evolutionary fabula "fails" conspicuously and produces out of that failure the self-conscious narrative discourse with which he comprehends sublime multiplicity. Darwin foregrounds his nar rative discourse, invites reader-observers into self-conscious practice of its discursive activity, precisely (and paradoxically) in order to expand their vision of the real fabula that it hypothesizes.</page><page sequence="4">70 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE This heavy emphasis in Darwin's writing on what cannot be seen raises the question of the applicability of Kantian rationalism to Darwin's empiricism. Although the Darwin ian sublime works quite well as an instance of what Kant describes, the end to which the Victorian scientist puts his discourse is different enough to warrant a digression into their respective intellectual projects. Kantianism was certainly influential in nineteenth-century philosophical debates concerning scientific explanation. Peter Allan Dale argues, for example, that positivist philosophy of science was concerned throughout the nineteenth century to define the precise role that artistic construction played in scientific hypothesis. Positivist philosophers looked back to the Romantics and through them to Kant's Critique of Judgment to identify the strong claims for human creativity in all forms of knowledge, claims they sought at first to refute but eventually came to incorporate into their own accounts of the construction of scientific knowledge.2 But although Darwin himself was a speculative thinker and affirmed the role of creative hypothesis, his intellectual project is clearly at odds with Kant's philosophy generally. Most fundamentally, Darwin broke with the teleological approach to explanation that informs Kant's entire discussion of the sublime. Furthermore, Darwin would never have used obser vations that concerned mental predispositions in the way Kant did ? to argue for the tran scendence of reason. The purpose of Darwin's studies of human thought patterns is directed toward establishing the continuities between human and animal mental behavior. That is to say, Darwin gave reason and art no privileged position outside nature. The two writers typically go in opposite directions. Kant reasons from the analysis of sense experience to the necessity of thinking that we have certain kinds of rational faculties. The existence of these in turn implies a "supersensible" domain which Kant associates with God.3 Darwin's perspective on all aesthetic and rational experience was to trace it back to historical origins in animal experience. Kant had reasoned from the teleological judgments of human minds to a reason that transcends, even eclipses, nature. Much of Kant's thought Darwin would have opposed for what he elsewhere called human "arrogance" toward, through an effective denial of, its natural origins. Darwin, on the other hand, deploys the sublime to historicize human reason as itself a product of natural history. Rather than argue for transcendent human capacity, Darwin's sublime is always deployed to establish ecological complexity and evolutionary process. Darwin embeds both the subject and the object in material history. In contrast to Kant's mathematical sublime, then, the Darwinian sublime is a horizon tal, materializing sublime. And yet it proceeds sequentially in much the way Kant details in his analysis: from apprehending items in an accumulating series until that culminating moment of cognitive failure ? a moment of loss that paradoxically gains a more compre hensive perspective. Indeed, as a rhetorician Darwin exploited the materializing potential of his own mathematical sublime to great effect. He deployed this discourse ? and its equation of loss and gain ? in order to displace prior visions of nature in favor of a newly complex nature of population dynamics. Reading Nature: Complexity and Darwin's Realistic Imagination George levine has shown that realism in the Victorian novel repeatedly "defines itself against the excesses, both stylistic and narrative, of various kinds of romantic, exotic, or sensational literatures" {Realistic 5). In order to establish the authority of its own vision,</page><page sequence="5">Darwin's 'Eye of Reason" 71 Darwin's scientific realism operates similarly, invoking other discourses in order to por tray them as excessive and removed from reality. For example, Darwin's presentation of population dynamics rhetorically casts "physiognomic" hermeneutics as a naive mode of observation that misreads nature. In this section, I describe this rhetorical displacement in order to turn later to the role of the sublime in the discourse of populational complexity. What must have been a very familiar nature first welcomed Victorian readers into the third chapter of On the Origin of Species. In a tone reminiscent of natural theology, Darwin there hymns his praise of nature's "exquisite adaptations": "We see these beauti ful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe [sic] ... in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations every where and in every part of the organic world" (60-61). By predicating of the first person plural that "we see . . . most plainly . . . everywhere and in every part of the organic world," this passage draws its readers together and gives them a shared visual experience comprehending all they have observed. Pastoral nature reveals adaptive structures that please their observers especially by being readily, omnipresently visible. Darwin is at pains to ascribe such an interpretive assurance to his audience because it serves as the target of his ensuing rhetoric. To understand Darwin's rhetorical strategy here is to infer and piece together possible contents for a public structure of perception that he himself assembled ? in order to dismantle. The practice of reading "physiogno mies" infers mental qualities from surface signs. As a figure for visible nature, the readable face served to underwrite intuitions concerning, in a phrase from Coleridge's Biographia Literaria, "the very spirit which gives the physiognomic expression to all the works of nature" (268; ch. 22). The rhetoric of the Origin positions itself against pastoral nature, certainly, but more significantly against all physiognomic reading, including the Col eridgean perspective that James Paradis has recognized in Darwin's own early writing. These Romantic inner landscapes arose out of vivid experiences in physical nature, involved a felt unity of perceiver and perceived, and were attributed with "emotional and spiritual content" (93). Whether seeking the God Darwin himself saw behind nature in his youth, or some other ontological or mentalistic quality, physiognomic reading was to become the screen Darwin felt he had to remove to enable readers to see real, complex population systems. He would have had in mind not only theological approaches to nature, but also landscape readings, such as the influential scientist Alexander Humboldt's "Ideas for a Physiognomy of Plants," that locate their referents in phenomenological impressions. In that essay, Humboldt first classifies plants according to their roles in distinguishing nature's regional "physiognomies." To explain what he means by these faces of nature, he refers to expres sions used by painters, such as "an Italian sky," and asserts that such expressions are based in an ill-defined and yet collective feeling about the "local character of nature" (24; my translation). Darwin would have insisted instead that the scientist should work against initial impressions: he had to distinguish his way of seeing from any quotidian confidence in one's ability to read faces right. To a physiognomic reading of nature Darwin contrasts a recognition and acceptance of nature's complexity. Darwin's own writing, in fact, transforms complexity from a cause of the scientist's frustration (as it is in physiognomic texts) into an experience of exhilara tion. When Darwin urges readers of the Origin to see how complex nature is, his language swells impressively. There are numerous varieties of emphatic words and phrases present</page><page sequence="6">72 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE almost everywhere in the text. During one reading, for example, I found "infinitely complex" occurring twelve times; "complex" thirty-five times; and at least twenty-two times similar reminders such as "chains of affinities," "excessively complex and radiating affinities," and the "inextricable web of affinities." The cumulative effect of this language is an aesthetic wonder that makes words like "astonishing," "wonderful," and "remark able" resonate easily in the authorial voice. Infinity ("innumerable," "endless") is invoked in at least thirty-one instances. The perspective behind much of this enthusiasm, further more, is central in Darwin's science; it arises from his careful application of Malthusian themes to nature. Volatile relations within and between populations, along with the vicissitudes of food source in an environment contingent upon changing topography and climate, combine to produce a dizzying "infinity" of causal possibilities. Not everyone who takes a walk in the country, however, sees evidence of population dynamics and ecological exchange. William Paley had once written, "It is a happy world after all. The air, the earth, the water, teem with delighted existence. In a spring noon, or a summer evening, on whichever side I turn my eyes, myriads of happy beings crowd upon my view" (490). For Darwin, too, nature habitually wore this happy expression. He had had to engage himself privately in the same epistemological effort against physiog nomic impressionism that he urges upon readers of the Origin. In a notebook entry not long after first coming to his theory of natural selection, he wrote: "It is difficult to believe in the dreadful/but quiet/war of organic beings, going in the peaceful woods, &amp; smiling fields. . . . but there is a contest &amp; a grain of sand turns the balance" {Metaphysics 200). The persuasive language in the following passage from the Origin, therefore, actually represents Darwin's personal experience: Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult ? at least I have found it so ? than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly ingrained in the mind, I am convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. (62) The next sentence includes his audience in the first person and quietly insists that it is our inclination to read nature as a face that misleads us: We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year. (62) What we "behold" is initially negated outright by what we "do not see," but then the negation is gently qualified by the suggestions that we "forget" or merely "do not always bear in mind." Pointing out that our way of seeing obscures a continuing drama, Darwin is tactfully, yet thoroughly, "defamiliarizing experience."4 With this interpretation, the most famous face-of-nature passage in Darwin's text also works to dissolve the image, only this time without explicit negation:</page><page sequence="7">Darwin's 'Eye of Reason" 73 The face of Nature may be compared to a yielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another with greater force. (67) A metaphor developed by a simile, the readable face is actually replaced here with a crowded multiplicity which is loud, violent, and dynamic. Notoriously difficult to process, the substituted wedge image can hardly be seen coherently as an image at all, and certainly not as a face. Gillian Beer finds the sentence "grotesque," even "sadistic [,]... an image of uncontrollably intense and repellent anthropomorphism" ("Face" 237). But on the rhetorical level, I am suggesting it is Darwin who is doing the violence. He is hammering away at a public anthropomorphism. The details of the wedge image are deliberately elusive; they make us work to see them. Is the yielding surface rippling? sinking? erupting? Is the surface composed of ten thousand wedges, or are they somehow positioned upon it? Are the wedges being driven toward a center? what does the directional preposition "in" signify? Are they forcing other wedges out? if so, what does "out" mean? All this activity, furthermore, is "inces sant," further problematizing efforts to fix it into an image. Darwin has carefully pre sented and activated a figure for nature that cannot be seen as a face. Observing Populations: Complexity and Limited Narration Trying to get an accurate picture of a mosaic, if you will, the pattern of which is constantly being shattered and reconstituted on a yielding surface, might well describe the felt experience of a Darwinian observer. And chapter three of the Origin attempts to communicate such an observational disorientation to the reader. Darwin deliberately forces his readers into an experience of the limitations constraining scientific observation. His focus on the difficulties of observation even leads him to choose first-person narration by the end of the chapter. James Krasner has compared Darwin's visual methods to those of his scientific predecessors and points out that although "human vision is extended" through the earlier writers' literary technique, Darwin's approach "emphasizes] the eye's limitations rather than its strengths" ("Chaos" 120). If Charles Lyell, for example, writes like an omniscient narrator scanning the geological past (125), Darwin locates himself inside time and identifies with an observer's point of view. Krasner argues furthermore that Darwin's present-tense perspective achieves an optical illusion of historical sequence by "crowding" gradated forms into the same "visual space" (132). There are other significant limitations placed on Darwin's textualized observers, however, that fall outside the purview of Krasner's optical approach. Krasner's analysis of the way in which Darwin diachronically orders fragments of individual forms excludes, for example, the Origin's vision of synchronie systems ? the complex ecology of life's rela tionships. The vision of nature Darwin wants his readers to experience is only possible after a process of increasing self-consciousness on the part of the observer. Darwin makes the idea of natural complexity real for his readers by carefully leading them into an experience of observer frustration and explanatory breakdown. Of the "rational formation of belief," Raphael Demos once argued that genuine thought is "a movement of the mind initiated by freshness of apprehension," and that activating such a process in an auditor is the most</page><page sequence="8">74 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE effective means of changing his or her world view. "Realization" of an idea results from feeling it act as it attempts to solve problems (229). Darwin must have come to a similar insight, for he wrote to this rhetorical purpose in "The Struggle for Existence," an essay I interpret as designed to produce a culminating effect. In order to present ecology, the text defamiliarizes nature with a series of surface/depth oppositions and engages readers through a problematizing technique of offering explanatory principles only to undermine each in turn. As readers are subjected to these ironic reversals, they are to experience the accumulating difficulty of ecological description until they eventually realize, in Demos's sense of the word, the sublime complexity of ecological connection. Leading up to the image of the ten thousand wedges there recurs a movement from prima facie explanation to the complex reality negating it, a rhetoric intended to uncover a drama of population expansion and the "checks" to that expansion. Darwin deploys Malthusian "mininarratives of growth" to invest the present with unseen potential.5 The imagined impact of swiftly reproducing species, for example, is intensified by using the potential of even the "slow"-breeding. One pair of elephants, "the slowest breeder of all known animals," could in just five centuries unleash on the world fifteen million elephants (64). Darwin also reports recorded population expansions: introduced European plants "clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants" on the La Plata plains; American plants spreading through India "from Cape Comorin to the Hima laya" (65). What especially interests him is the daily invisibility of the checks that prevent this expansion elsewhere. "Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead us: we see no great destruction falling on them, and we forget that thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of" (65). Unseen destruction and the expansive potential it contains are suddenly recovered right nearby, in many of the readers' own pets and farm animals. That Darwin can find this hidden drama taking place anywhere he chooses we find out later when the text places him on his hands and knees in an area of lawn grass he has been watching. He has counted the species of plants which reappear after mowing: out of twelve only nine survived (68). A similar observation of weeds on another occasion revealed that out of 357 individuals reappearing, 295 were destroyed "chiefly by slugs and insects" (67). He is reminding his readers that under their very feet a struggle is daily taking place. This mysterious action goes forward under the quiet surface of an English lawn. In another, contrasting example, Darwin creates a dramatic mininarrative of nature's preda tory power: Thus, there seems to be little doubt that the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed. (68) This is a coup of the unexpected. If the annual killing of hundreds of thousands of game animals were stopped, one would think those hundreds of thousands would thrive and produce millions. But the hidden, complex web of relations eludes commonsense expec tation. A predator population could, if left alone, quickly increase to unimagined propor</page><page sequence="9">Darwin's "Eye of Reason" 75 tions and more than compensate for the change which produced it. All the game hunters of England cannot match the destructive power that would be suddenly released through reproduction if they simply stopped shooting. In a carefully crafted moment of situational irony, Darwin's narrative discourse anticipates and contradicts the explanatory plot his readers expect. The constantly active tension between powers of rapid reproduction and their oppos ing checks is the conflict that produces all Malthusian narrative. Darwin, however, invests the present with this same dynamism, and thus emphasizes a constant volatility of inter acting populations ? activity he believes generally to escape reader perception. The longer passage out of which I earlier extracted the image of the ten thousand wedges is now worth quoting more fully, in order at once to underscore its ironic direction from surface to depth and locate it more firmly in Darwin's presentation of ecology. In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mind ? never to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during each generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number of species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount. The face of Nature may be compared to a yielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another with greater force. (Origin 66-67) The same language of appeal that undermined the "face of nature bright with gladness" here reminds us "never to forget" that both the pressures of expansion and its containment are constant. The dramatic volatility emphasized in the next sentence (recall pr?dation suddenly standing in for all of England's hunters) makes it clear that the wedges of the final sentence are meant primarily to signify populations and species, not individuals. The image conveys the dynamic complexity of population ecology. Heuristically, the yielding surface would then suggest topography: the changing mountains, plains, valleys, streams, rivers, and lakes that provide life with its natural habitats.6 When the reality under focus is as multiplicitous and changing as Darwin's wedge image suggests, assessing the structural principles of even one particular system within it is difficult indeed. Darwin quietly exclaims that "what checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number is most obscure" (67). Under the general category of these checks to expansion, the greater part of the essay invites the reader on a search for principles that will shed some light on population ecology. "We know not exactly what the checks are in even one single instance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head, even in regard to mankind, so incomparably better known than any other animal" (67). In emphasizing a limited observer's position, Darwin's prose achieves a seductive proximity to its readers that seeks rhetorical identification. If we are misled by nature, if we find it difficult to understand, so too does Darwin. Identification, as Kenneth Burke once noted, can give readers a sense of "creatively participating" in rather than "merely receiving" an idea. He adds that such a "collaborative expectancy" can be enhanced by "purely formal patterns" (57-58). Darwin's discussion of ecology features such a pattern in its alternation between</page><page sequence="10">76 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE proposing and problematizing explanations. A good example is the way in which Darwin demonstrates the obscurity of checks to increase by proposing a principle to help antici pate a population's actual success in nature: organisms reproducing thousands each year should be more successful than those producing only a few. But the obvious does not hold. The condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two: the Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca, a single one; but this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. {Origin 66) Having just dramatized rapid rates of reproduction, Darwin now shows that slow breeders may far outnumber the swift. He proceeds to inform that superfecundity may even compensate for massive destruction early in life. As grounds for understanding population strength, a rapid reproductive rate has eroded considerably: representing first the poten tial to cover the globe, it then proves an unreliable criterion for predicting actual increase, and ends up signifying a vulnerability. Rapid rate of increase is a sign in nature's physiog nomy that lacks determinate meaning. As for actual checks, Darwin first asserts that available food source marks "the extreme limit to which each [species] can increase" (68). He adds, on the other hand, that often it is pr?dation rather than food source which regulates a population's average number. Hereupon follows as illustration the scenario comparing the predators' superior impact to that of the hunters. Immediately, then, Darwin erases this graphic power with the examples of the elephant and rhinoceros, who have no predators at all (68). This practice of negating even touches one of Darwin's own cardinal positions, that an already numerous population will have an advantage because its higher variability is more likely to come up with variations having survival value in the struggle for existence. When a population increases rapidly in a small area, however, it can experience an epidemic, a "limiting check," Darwin mysteriously describes as "independent of the struggle for life" (70). These reverses begin to impress one with the endless particularity with which popula tion study must come to terms. Structured by phrases of contrast like "on the other hand, in many cases," the text moves from idea to idea, ecosystem to ecosystem, without coming to an epistemological resting place. What is unknown gathers in proportions. The effect of climate on population will serve as a final example. Turning around whether the climate's influence on population is direct or indirect, the discussion begins by asserting that periods of unseasonably extreme weather would appear "the most effective of all checks." It is not cold or heat that kills, however, but their power to decrease food supply and thus intensify competition for that which remains. That climate thus acts only indirectly to intensify the struggle for existence is brought home in the following cinematic passage: When we travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is a very false view: we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly</page><page sequence="11">Darwin's "Eye of Reason" 11 suffering enormous destruction ... and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and, as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease. (69) The appearance of climate's direct effect is problematized and exposed as a "very false view." What it misses is the connection of climate to a volatile ecology of mutually regulating populations. As Darwin's narrative camera travels northward over the geogra phy, its panoramic sweep emphasizes the need for analysis of the species involved on a ground-level, ecosystem-by-ecosystem basis. Following this passage another, more observant cinematic scan further differentiates the kinds of changes the particular regions exhibit. Traveling southward, we watch certain species decline; returning north, however, we see a different set of species decline, but we also get fewer and fewer species of all kinds, with many stunted forms as well. Approach ing the Arctic brings us to a region in which "the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements," where climate's effect is direct (69). The overview has taken us from direct effect on population average (which Darwin anticipates as his readers' initial conclusion) to indirect effect through food reduction (the "true" view that belies the former "false view"), and then back to climate's direct effect; but this time confining it to Arctic regions, absolute deserts, and the tops of snow-capped mountains. Shifting yet a third time, Darwin's final use of the principle returns to climate's indirect influence and brings the ecological drama up to the edge of his audience's English gardens: That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants, nor resist destruction by our native animals. (69) A gardening fact with which many of his readers will be familiar provides entrance, if read correctly, to a mysterious connectivity that waits beyond the garden plots. Able to thrive in the climate, foreign plants nonetheless need protection from the native ecology in order to survive. Reversing the mood of the conventional domestic/foreign opposition, Darwin here locates the mysterious, the unknown, and the complex as native to English soil. Around the protected confines of the gardens hover systems of indigenous English plants and animals whose mysterious workings recall the entangled world Darwin encountered as a youth in the Brazilian forest. As the sense of complexity heightens near the end of the essay, so does the sense of wonder, and so too does the presence of the narrating observer. The text locates its eye of reason as an "I" who must place himself in order to see. Darwin walks into an area of "extensive heaths" in Surrey with sections fenced off from the cattle. In the enclosures, Scotch firs are "springing up in multitudes, so close together that all cannot live" (71). Upon verifying that the firs were not planted, he relates: "I was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir" (72). Then Darwin narrates his own movement from surface point of view to closer understanding, and relates his surprise in the first person:</page><page sequence="12">78 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE But on looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seed lings . . . which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard ... I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of growth, had during twenty-six years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely ... searched it for food. (72) Of unseen ecologies Darwin has learned to infer what "no one would ever have imag ined." From this linear example of "cattle absolutely determining] the existence of... Scotch fir," Darwin turns to a Paraguayan ecosystem where "insects determine the existence of cattle." Although the passage begins with linear causality, it ends in a vision of nonlinearity. As mutual population relations accumulate, the reality under composition becomes sublimely impossible to represent. [H]ere neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and ... this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually checked by some means, probably by birds. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in Paraguay, the flies would decrease ? then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter... the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects; and this ... the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity. (72-73) This process of reflection begins with a biogeographical fact (Paraguay has no wild cattle, horses, or dogs) and its unilinear explanation, the fly population. Then Darwin adds two other causal factors: insectivorous birds and their predators. As he sets these pressured wedges in motion, however, complex relations increase, new populations and population levels come into play, the entire system is set into a spiraling accumulating action, and the ramifications quickly become too involved to conjecture. Darwin's ecological series con tinues "onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity." This culminating phrase realizes an important moment of the Darwinian sublime. And it does so by putting another elusive, abstract image into motion, a metaphor substituted for an ecosystem that Darwin cannot determinately represent. A geometrical figure, the ever-increasing circles of complexity both instantiate and resist James Paradis's thesis that Darwin's fully theorized landscapes are abstract map pings of "organic position" (103). Paradis defines the physical mapping Darwin came to practice as "the positioning of natural entities in relation to one another and not in relation to the observer himself" (101), and in its emphasis of spatial position over ontological presence, this interpretation also illuminates the Paraguayan circles image. Proliferating circles indeed suggest a necessary further systematization of relationships and laws, and this implied project holds forth the promise, at least, of a more abstract precision. But Paradis's approach does not take into account how self-consciously situated and provi sional all Darwin's ecological observation is. Though not ontologically so, perhaps, Dar win's ecosystems are, I would argue, explicitly seen in perspective, in relativizing connection to the observer's own position. If the ever-increasing circles appear concentric,</page><page sequence="13">Darwin's "Eye of Reason" 79 for example, it is only because they are narrated from a particular, located point of view. As John Campbell notes, Darwin was a field naturalist before he was a systematist; his interest in "nature's endless variety" was too strong to prioritize systematization ("Invis ible" 66). And in chapter three of the Origin it is clear that the "endless variety" of concern to Darwin was not only that of individual organic forms, but also, crucially, that of different (and constantly changing) population systems. The Paraguayan circles metaphor does illustrate well, on the other hand, the sublime of vastness which Paradis associates with Darwin (Paradis 87). The circles suggest geo graphical, physical expanse; Paraguayan ecology cannot, they indicate, be restricted to Paraguay. Related to bordering populations as well as to continental topography, the ecosystem (if subjected to some hypothetical totalizing description) would cross even mountain ranges and oceanic divides, for these too change and allow interaction across their borders. As Susan Cannon has observed, not only was Darwin's science a "biotopog raphical vision" (235), but that vision was also ? as it was in many other nineteenth-cen tury achievements in natural history ? for a science "of the whole world" (97). Envisioning Evolution: Natural Selection and the Sublime I have argued that Darwin's discussion of population ecology works textually as a rhetoric of the realistic imagination. It dismantles physiognomic readings of nature's face and replaces them with visions of complexity. This rhetorical displacement, furthermore, also involves a significant textual concurrence: the discourses of first-person limited nar ration and the sublime. For the sublimity of "ever-increasing circles of complexity" occurs just after Darwin, in order to make sense of the barren heath, begins placing himself in the field at different points of view. Darwin's sublime thus arises at the moment the text's observer runs up against his limitations. It is as if the complexities of the observed induce the observing scientist to discard a self-effacing, omniscient narrative posture and situate himself in the field being observed. A scientist narrativizing his own "eye of reason" for scientific ends. This is to suggest, on another level, a narrative embedded in the observer's experience itself. Observing one causal relation in the Paraguayan ecosystem leads to observing another, and another, and so on, until the series becomes impossible to observe or process as a single system. At this level, the metaphorical movement "onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity" indicates the mental process typical of the mathematical sublime. Darwin proceeded to apprehend in sequence an ever-accumulating and spiraling series of causal relations. But out of this effort toward comprehending the entire system, he experiences cognitive failure, a loss that then paradoxically produces the gain of a more comprehensive perspective. Similarly, moving from the synchronie dimension of Darwin's sublime to the dia chronic, we see not only related rhetorical purposes motivating the texts, but also the same narrativized experience of observation. Just as Darwin attempts to remove his readers' physiognomic impressions by accumulating ecological complexity, he also tries to deepen awareness of the geological past through recommending an exercise in dis cerning particulates of time: "A man must for years examine for himself great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the sea at work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment, before he can hope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time, the</page><page sequence="14">80 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE monuments of which we see around us" {Origin 282). In order to write deep time into the present topography, Darwin here asks readers to observe the minute momentary changes effected by the waves, accumulate these, and then "comprehend" them in a series sublimely large enough to account for geological "monuments." A few paragraphs later he asks them to imagine the sea "eatpng] into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century" (286). These exercises in the Darwinian sublime particularize, multiply, and then compress time. Their rhetorical purpose on one level is to create for the reader a time span large enough to accommodate the "hosts of living forms" necessary for gradualist evolution. "What an infinite number of generations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have suc ceeded each other in the long roll of years! Now turn to our richest geological museums, and what a paltry display we behold!" (287). Darwin's text observes Lyellian gradualism, but features the narrativistic manipulation necessary to do so. Darwin invites his readers to participate deliberately in the reflexive process of imagining gradualist narrative. Whereas Lyell's omniscient narrator travels easily over eons, backgrounding his own technique for the sake of the realist illusion, Darwin's narrator foregrounds the difficulty involved, asking readers to compress into the present what "the mind cannot grasp." Darwin sees expansively by staging the limitation of his own vision.7 The language of the Origin also uses diachronic compression to visualize biological species changing in time. In a celebrated passage, for example, readers are called upon to imagine possible intermediate frames between a single membrane-coated nerve and the human eye, and then see them as one evolutionary movement. On another occasion the compression is pinpointed in a single word, when Darwin writes of the eye of an under ground salamander being "obliterated" over the course of centuries. But these evolutions of isolated forms should be placed inside the theory's more ecological understanding of how change takes place in time. The full Darwinian sublime is a harmonized perception of complex ecosystems with geological and evolutionary history. Darwin unites ecological dynamics and diachronic compression, for example, in the earlier, less often quoted "entangled bank" passage of chapter three: When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient Indian mounds... display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests. What a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand: what war between insect and insect ? between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of prey ? all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! Throw up a handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins! (74-75) Myriads of "action[s] and reaction[s]" compress into a single action that is both ecological and historical: the reproduction on ancient burial grounds of the surrounding American</page><page sequence="15">Darwin's "Eye of Reason" 81 forest. These moments of the Darwinian sublime in the Origin, just like the earlier reflections on coral reefs, occur only "after reflection." Such perceptions are rational acts; the sublime perspective is only possible as the eye of reason infers a historical process. To view a forest scientifically Darwin first hypothesizes particular actions (a seed falls, an insect feeds on a tree, a bird eats a seed or an insect, and so on); next imagines these in ever-increasing circles of complexity (trees against trees, insects against insects, with snails, other animals, and various predators in spiraling relations); and then finally accu mulates and compresses all into a single action ("the action and reaction of innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins"). These multiple actions and reactions of populations over centuries together make up the referent for Darwin's organic "nature." He once explained: "I mean by Nature, only the aggregate action and product of many laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us" (Origin, 6th ed. 55). The particulars are myriads of events, the laws are perceived patterns in those events (insect populations increasing, bird populations check ing them, and so on) and nature is nothing else but the sublime "aggregate action and product" of those many patterns of events. As a signifier, "nature" stands in for a sublime compression of an impossible multiplicity. As an object of knowledge, furthermore, Darwin's nature is itself constructed here as the product of the observing knowing subject. The patterns in the events are perceived and "ascertained by us," Darwin's community of empirical scientists and general readers. As such it is a construct typical of the sublime I have been describing, only carried now to a more comprehensive inclusivity. A hypostatized totality, "nature" is explicitly posi tioned in this text as a substitution for what cannot be determinately represented in the aggregate ? an impossible collection of synchronie and diachronic series. Darwin personifies this aggregate and has it "select" or "choose" variations in nature that happen to be best suited for thriving in their local population interactions. These "selections," or more precisely remainders, accumulate in various directions and thus natural forms transm?tate. Just as the many coral polyps' actions are collectivized into one synchronie activity, the choices made by Darwin's personified nature are themselves metaphorical substitutions for aggregates impossible to comprehend. If "ever-increasing circles of complexity" stand in for accumulating ecological complexity; if "obliteration" represents the gradual process by which an underground salamander species loses its eye; all these ? together with countless other synchronie systems and diachronic processes ? are compressed into one personified metaphor: nature selecting. The sentence quoted above, in fact, is part of Darwin's famous answer to criticisms of the personification in his idea of natural selection. Here is his fuller statement from the sixth edition of the Origin: It has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets? Everyone knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by Nature, only the aggregate action and product of many laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us. With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be forgotten. (54-55)</page><page sequence="16">82 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE In Darwin's presentation of population complexity we have seen how "the sequence of events as ascertained by us" becomes sublimely difficult to comprehend as a unity pre cisely when we begin studying the population ecosystems with particularizing precision. Darwin's definitions of nature and scientific law assert, finally, that limited, situated human observation must, out of necessity, substitute metaphor for particularized multi plicity. Darwin's interpretation of his own metaphor, in other words, would have it pointing to not one personified being but millions of characters ? all the organic populations whose collective interactions constitute nature.8 My point is not so much to defend his interpretation as it is to demonstrate that his own exposition of the idea confirms it as a construct of the sublime. Nature becomes a collective persona in action, a metaphorical substitution for a sublime multiplicity of characters and their many events. As such, natural selection is the metaphor for a sublimely differentiated, decentralized, and yet totalizing power to effect immense change. Issuing as it does out of the Origin's vision of population complexity and evolu tionary gradualism, the Darwinian sublime is constitutive in that text's evolutionary theory. One implication of this analysis is that the Darwinian sublime constructs its most important object ? the explanatory principle of natural selection ? through a particular kind of negation. When Kant wrote of the "negative presentation" of the sublime image, he was arguing that the sublime presents the power of reason negatively, by coming up against the sensible image's inadequacy to the representation which that reason demands. Darwin's "ever-increasing circles of complexity" image, for example, registers the imagi nation's inadequacy and thus, negatively, "presents" the Paraguayan ecosystem's real, natural complexity. Thus for both Kant and Darwin a representational breakdown is the opportunity for the gain of a greater idea of reality. But whereas for Kant this reality was the transcendence of reason, for Darwin it was the endless intricacy and minute invisibility of evolution by populational change. In an essay on the relation between philosophical aesthetics and the idea of the sublime, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe critiques this negativity as the figure that gives what he calls "sublime truth" its sense of reality, or "presence." It presents the "fact" that there is the nonpresentable. However ? and I return thus to the question of metaphor, if it is a metaphor ? the nonpresentable is conceived here as non-unveilable, and this makes a big difference because the prosopopoeia of nature in its totality, or of the totality of beings (it is the totality itself which is nonunveilable, that is the unity of all that is: its Being), is also a prosopopoeia of truth. (90) \ Whether or not one accepts Lacoue-Labarthe's critical opposition to the metaphysics of presence, his analysis does capture the representational strategy of Darwin's idea of natural selection. The prosopopoeia of Darwin's scientific truth can of course be seen in his god-like "nature" that "selects." Darwin argues explicitly, however, that this per sonification is a metaphorical substitution for a totality of organisms and events which is impossible to represent. In staging and arguing for natural selection Darwin is indeed attempting to "present the 'fact' that there is the nonpresentable."</page><page sequence="17">Darwin's "Eye of Reason" 83 His object's nonpresentability must have made the sublime's affective power that much more important to Darwin. Considerably more difficult to imagine than a sub merged mountain, natural selection was a representation that would never strike the eye of the body. But after reflection, it might strike the eye of reason. Carnegie Mellon University NOTES 1. Many areas have been identified in which literary and scientific writing interact. The growing field of literature and science studies, however, seeks to analyze how and why actual conver gences occur and to what extent they are more than incidental (see Levine, "One Culture" 3-4). Hyman confidently ropes off the imagination as non-scientific, attributing the Origin's success more to tragic, poetic, and "scriptural" qualities than to scientific argument. Less comfortable with two cultures, Campbell counters ideas of Darwin's "affective decline" with his "praise of nature," and yet Campbell's "balance" model retains the mutually repelling terms of opposed discourses: "responsiveness to nature" protects Darwin from "mere scientific description" and "anti-affective demands of analysis," thereby "humanizing] knowledge through emotion" ("Nature" 159,161,162,168,173). Corrective, in this light, is Gillian Beer's reading of Darwin's texts as "materializing" the "real events" his theory postulates: his language is imaginative because the science reaches beyond the sensibly apparent, metaphorical because it seeks to replace nonmaterial with material grounds for meaning, multivocal because it presents an ecological density of relations and affinities, and narrativized because it is a science of change (Darwin's Plots 3, 29-48). Extending Beer's suggestion that great scientific theories are most influential culturally as unexamined as sumptions and adopting the philosopher Gerald Holton's emphasis on the underlying cul tural "themata" that structure scientific theorizing, Levine analyzes Victorian fiction and (mostly Darwin's) science as parallel projects engaged in secularizing natural-theological themes (Darwin 1-23). Levine sees cultural themata of the Darwinian imagination in nine teenth-century science and literature well before Darwin, even as he emphasizes that they found their unique and most powerful combination in Darwin's own innovative theory. 2. According to Dale, the ghost of Kant and his insistence upon the faculties and categories which the human mind brings to the world, and out of which it constitutes its knowledge of the world, hovers over the entire century of scientific thought (26-30). Though Darwin presented himself at times in his Autobiography as rigidly empiricist in his method, mechani cally inducing laws from facts (119,139), he operated quite differently in his own scientific writings. He was one of the most energetically speculative and creative of scientists, alter nating between formulating hypotheses, bringing them to the data he carefully accumulated, then reformulating his hypotheses in response. So it is unlikely that Darwin would have objected in principle to the position that the mind has certain prior tendencies it brings to the data it examines. Indeed Herbert Spencer formulated an evolutionary account of how the Kantian categories came to be established as a phenomenon. Such a line of reasoning is consistent with Darwin's program of writing into an evolved human instinct many of the capacities formerly thought to separate humanity from the animals (see Richards 285-87). 3. Darwin eventually discounted transcendental interpretations of experiences of the sublime, as is clear in his critique of the religious sublime (see Autobiography 91-92). And early references in his notes to Edmund Burke's essay on the sublime seem motivated primarily by his desire to collapse the human/animal distinction through explaining human emotions as continuous with other animals' feelings (see, for example, Darwin, Metaphysics 80-81).</page><page sequence="18">84 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE For more on the ways in which Darwin negotiated his move away from categories of the transcendent see Paradis, and Levine, Darwin, esp. 24-55, 84-118. 4. I owe this phrase to Levine's Darwin and the Novelists (104). Levine's study demonstrates the rhetorical adeptness with which Darwin would take natural-theological themes and observations and deploy them to opposing ends (see 84-118). 5. The phrase is Krasner's (123); his analysis offers excellent comparisons and contrasts of the narrative techniques of Paley, Malthus, Lyell, and Darwin. 6. Beer points to one of Darwin's earlier unpublished uses of this metaphor, in which, I would point out, the "yielding surface" not only remains mysterious but is given an underlying "hard layer, fluctuating in its level, and which may represent the minimum amount of food required by each living being, and which layer will be impenetrable by the sharpest wedge" (Darwin, qtd. in Beer "Face" 233-34). Darwin's earlier inclusion here of a fluctuating hard layer under a yielding surface becomes even more difficult to see. But the layer's interpre tation as minimal food necessary puts the entire image at an even greater metaphorical remove from a "face." 7. For a related and longer contrast of these narrative styles, see Krasner. 8. The theoretical notion of natural selection and its language of personification are analogous to other personifications such as the Althusserian assertion that Society (or Ideology) interpolates individuals as subjects. Personifying a collective entity does not mean one thinks it has a mind or intention, or is even a unified force at all.
