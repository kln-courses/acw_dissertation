<plain_text><page sequence="1">FLORANCE WATERBURY: THE TIGER AND AGRICULTURE An Answer to Mr. Davidson The "Art Bulletin" of September, 1943, Vol. XXV, No.3, published an interesting and comprehensive review by Mr. J. Le Roy Davidson of the present writer's book, " Early Chinese Symbols and Literature: Vestiges and Speculations". Mr. Davidson differed from the writer on a number of points; among these being the writer's theory that one of the functions of the Shang symbolic Tiger was that of an agricultural deity. Mr. Davidson rejects this theory and repudiates the Li Ki as an authoritative source. He writes as follows: "In contradiction to Creel's quoted observation,' I know of no tradition of sacrifices either of or to the tiger in ancient times,' Miss Waterbury maintains that the tiger's chief aspect, after its function as a guardian, was that of an agricultural deity. She quotes from the Li Chi: 'The ancient wise men had ap- pointed all these agencies, and it was felt necessary to make this return to them. They met the (represen- tatives of the) cats, because they devoured the rats and mice (which injured the fruits) of the field, and (those of) the tiger, because they devoured the (wild) boars (which destroyed them). They met them and made offerings to them.' It should be noted here that the Li Chi is not only a late but a poor source. Moreover, in context, the sacrifice mentioned is the last of eight, hardly fitting for the chief agricultural deity. The author quotes a story from De Groot (without mentioning his source) about 'two divine men', Lhen-tu and Yuh-lei, who fettered evil spirits and gave them to the tiger to devour. Identifying the names of the ' divine men' with plants, she calls them 'plant spirits' and considers the story suggestive of the tiger as a protection of agriculture ". "Even if we were to accept Miss Waterbury's identification, based as it is on such tenuous sources, it would hardly explain the tiger as the chief agricultural deity. The weather, in its various aspects of rain, drought, heat or frost, is the prime agricultural factor. Creel has shown very convincingly that the li wen spiral pattern, which covers most Shang bronzes, probably means rain or clouds (Creel, Studies in Early Chinese Culture, p. 237). The theory that the tiger, because it kills animals harmful to growing crops, is the primary agricultural deity, seems far less tenable than one that would consider the chief deity to be a force of nature, which controls the growth itself; for instance, one of the most frequent questions ap- pearing on the oracle bones is, 'Will it rain ?'. The protector of growing crops more likely would be a secondary deity." Two minor points to be commented on are: the Tiger sacrifice is the seventh mentioned in the Li Ki, not the last of the eight; Mr. Bushell associated the li wen with storm at least thirty-eight years ago (Bushell, Chinese Art, p. 77, znd ed., 1909). In this article the writer will give additional reasons for considering the Tiger an agricultural deity, and will also present evidence which, in her opinion, upholds the authority of the Li Ki, in this particular instance. The earliest objects of primitive man's worship were, in the writer's opinion, the great animals. In his limited periphery, they were of vital importance; his adjustment to them being often a matter of life and death. During the immeasurably vast duration of pre-agricultural time, the impression made by their powers upon man's imagination was so profound that it is still vital and vivid today. 56</page><page sequence="2">The worship of natural forces implies an extension of the mental periphery, some recognition of cause and effect, and of time. The natural forces were important principally in regard to agriculture, with which they are inevitably associated. It seems to the writer doubtful that worship of natural forces could have long pre-dated agriculture. But the transference of attention to agriculture and the natural forces did not mean the exclusion of the ancient animal-gods, belief in whom had become a part of man's very consciousness. Just as all religions retain elements of still earlier religions, so the animal-gods became associated with the later recognized natural forces. Indeed, as will be seen presently, they were sometimes believed to be the controlling powers behind the natural forces. The question, "Will it rain?", therefore does not necessarily imply the power of a natural force; it may have implied the power of the Shang Tiger ruling the natural force, as later on it could have implied that of the Dragon. In this transitional stage, where worship of the great animals and of the natural forces overlap, the animal- god probably retained all his original powers for some time, while acquiring new ones which had some connection with the natural forces or agriculture, however vague such a link might be. In the case of the Tiger-deity, it was exceedingly clear. An act of assistance as concrete as that of devouring animals harmful to the crops made the Tiger's protective connection with agriculture obvious and assured. Later on the importance of agriculture might cause the earlier powers of the animal-god to diminish to disappear, and to be forgotten. Animal-worship, and its survival, animal-symbolism, are widespread and enduring. Though the natural forces are worshipped in the hymns of the Rig-Veda, Vishnu, Indra, Brihaspati, are still "Bulls"; Soma Pavamana, the moon-god, is "the bull who leads the herd", also "a good horse", "a vigorous steed". (Hindu Scriptures, ed. MacNicol.) Later on in India the eternal deity Brahma was believed to be the source from which all things emanated, yet the first Adhyaya of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad begins: "Verily the dawn is the head of the horse which is fit for sacrifice, the sun its eye, the wind its breath", etc. (Sacred Books of the East, Max Miuller). In the Bhagavadgit?, Krishna calls Arjuna, "O tiger among men," as a term of praise (Hindu Scriptures, ed. MacNicol.). Animal-symbolism is pervasive in nearly, all the great religions; in Christianity, the Bull, the Eagle, and the Lion are still emblems of three of the Evangelists; the Lamb and the Dove are two of the highest symbols. One may imagine the strength of the original conception; one may understand why worship of the natural forces did not exclude worship of the Tiger-deity in China. The significance of a closely-related carnivore in this transitional period in other countries may offer some suggestions as to the symbolic meaning of the Shang Tiger. Mr. Miguel Covarrubias in his book on Tehuantepec makes the following statements about the jaguar: "In ancient times the jaguar was an earthgod, symbol of the interior of the earth, and of the night, of darkness.... He was the god of caves, the dark interior of mountains". (Covarrubias, Mexico South, p. 78, Knopf, 1946) "Jaguar-gods (of the earth, rain, and thunderbolts) were among the oldest deities." (Op. cit., p. 99) " Predominant among the Zapotec gods was Cosijo, the god of rain and lightning, whose jaguar-mask pervades ancient Zapotec art, and who held in his power the fertility of the earth by giving it the vivifying rain, or could, if he wished, destroy life by droughts, innundations, hail, frost and thunderbolts. There was 57</page><page sequence="3">also frequent mention of ' Heart of the Land', a jaguar-god of the earth's interior, who appears to have been the principal god of the Tehuantepec region, and who was adopted by the Aztecs under the name of Tepeyollotl." (Op. cit., p. 358). Here is an instance of an animal-god controlling the natural forces. Is it not possible that the pre-Shang Tiger may also have been an earth-god, symbol of caves and of the earth's interior, perhaps the controller of rain? Mr. Covarrubias suggests an explanation of the large greenstone "yokes" often decorated with jaguars or frogs, found near Vera Cruz: "Frogs and jaguars represented the earth; the shape of these yokes is reminiscent of the representations of jaguar mouths and caves, also symbols of the earth." (Op. cit., p. 118). Concerning the archaic pre-Olmec culture he says: "Their gods were all jaguars; sky-jaguars, rain-jaguars, and earth-jaguars. The earth was symbolized by a jaguar's open mouth, the caves from which their mythical chiefs, the leaders of humanity, had sprung." (Op. cit., p. 125). This significance of the jaguar's open mouth is interesting in connection with the Tiger in China. Mr. Davidson has written of "The Bird-in-the-animal-mouth on Chinese Bronzes" (Gazette des Beaux- Arts, (Jan. 1945). The animals, usually tigers, holding birds or, in some cases, human beings, have al- ways seemed to the writer to have a protective significance. A connection with caves and the earth does not seem at all impossible. The Mayas of Chiapas, Mr. Covarrubias says, also called the jaguar "Heart" and "Innermost". A late stage of this ancient cult exists today in Yucatan. Sefior Alfonso Villa Rojas, writing of the gods in Quintana Roo, that isolated, little-known part of Yucatan where, as he says, so many archaic customs are preserved, describes the different "balamob" (jaguars, singular: balam) jaguar-gods, among whose functions probably the most important is that of guarding the cornfields. "El balam-col es el balam que se ocupa de cuidar la milpa." A balam stands in each of the four corners of the field; they drive away harmful animals and robbers. The present writer, having offered the theory that the Shang Tiger was a "guardian" has been interested to note that the Yucatecans of Quintana Roo apply the same term to the jaguar. The balamob are "canin-gracia", guardians of the corn. Nor do their powers end there; they are guardians of the people, particularly those who go astray in the mountains; and also "canan- cahob", guardians of the pueblos, where the four entrances, which coincide with the four cardinal points, are each guarded by a balam. The pattern of the cornfield is repeated not only in the pueblos, but also extends to heaven, where the four rain-gods stand at each corner of the sky. (Alfonso Villa Rojas, Dioses y Espiritus paganos de los Mayas de Quintana Roo, in "1Los Mayas Antiguos", El Colegio de Mexico, i94I). The weaving of the animal-god with the natural forces is very clear; though the balamob are completely anthropomorphised in Quintana Roo today. In I946 Dr. Strong of Columbia University, Chairman of the Institute of Andean Research, discovered in Peru the grave of a Mochica priest impersonating an agricultural jaguar-god. On his body lay a ceremonial digging-stick surmounted by the carved image of a long-fanged god, wearing a feather- and jaguar-head-dress and holding a digging-stick adorned with a jaguar's head. By his side stands a small boy who scatters turquoise seeds from a basket into the furrows made by the deity's stick. The head-dress above the priest's body corresponds to that on the digging-stick; the skeleton of a small boy, with the remains of a basket similar to the basket on the digging-stick, lay beside him, and 58</page><page sequence="4">a great number of small turquoises were found near the priest's neck. That he had other powers beside agricultural is indicated by the presence of two other objects: one a ceremonial digging-stick adorned by the image of a burrowing owl; the other a finely carved, spear-pointed war mace which had evidently been much used, the large bird on the top being broken. Dr. Strong says that "the jaguar-god concept is very old in Peru", ranging from the Chavin era in the First Millenium, B. C. through the Inca period. (William Duncan Strong, Finding the Tomb of a Warrior-god, in National Geographic Magazine, April 1947). The writer cited in her book the fact that in certain districts in modern India the tiger is regarded as a protector of the crops. It should be understood that no suggestion of connection or derivation involving China, India, Medico, Yucatan and Peru is intended. It seems far more probable, in the writer's opinion, that similar conditions occurring at more or less the same stages of human development have produced similar ideas. Coming now to the Li Ki, it may be well to quote the entire passage referring to the sacrificial cere- monies in honor of the eight agricultural deities: "The great Ka sacrifice of the Son of Heaven consisted of eight (sacrifices). This sacrifice was first instituted by Yin Khi. (The word) Ki expresses the idea of searching out. In the 12th month of a year, they brought together (some of) all the productions (of the harvest) and sought out (the authors of them) to present them to them as offerings. "In the KA sacrifice, the principal object contemplated was the Father of Husbandry. They also pre- sented offerings to (ancient) superintendents of husbandry and to the (discoverers of) various grains, to express thanks for the crops which had been reaped. They presented offerings (also) to the (repre- sentativas of the ancient inventors of the overseers of the husbandmen, and of the buildings, marking out the boundaries of the fields and of the birds and beasts. Couvreur translates this more happily: 'On faisait des offrandes aux manes des inspecteurs des champs, des constructeurs des cabanes qui marquaient les limites des terres (et servaient d'habitations aux inspecteurs)'. 'On en faisait aussi aux mines des animaux.' (Couvreur, Li Chi, Chapitre IX, Art. II, p. 594-5). The service showed the highest sentiments of benevolence and of righteousness. "The ancient wise men had appointed all these agencies, and it was felt necessary to make this return to them. They met the (representatives of the) cats, because they devoured the rats and mice (which injured the fruits) of the fields, and (those of) the tigers because they devoured the (wild) boars (which destroyed them). They met them and made offerings to them. They offered also to (the ancient In- ventors of) the dykes and water-channels; (all these were) provisions for the husbandry." (Legge, Li Ki, XXVII, V, Section II, p. 431). The contests between the tiger and the boar were apparently well-known from antiquity; Dr. Erkes says that the character "ch'i" means "the fight between a Tiger and a Boar that will not let each other go" (Erkes, Das Sckwein im alten China, Monumenta Serica, Vol. VII, 194~2). In her book previously mentioned, the writer stated her conviction that books compiled even as late as the Li Ki contain passages derived from much earlier times. She cited several of these "vestiges" of ancient days which had been verified by modern research. The above passage from the Li Ki has always seemed to her to be such a "vestige". 59</page><page sequence="5">The late M. Edouard Chavannes seems to have considered its content seriously; furthermore, he has linked it to the present day. In his book on the sacred Mount Tai, he gives the following description of the deities in one of the temples: "San Houang Miao, 'Temple des trois souverains'. Au centre se tient Fou-hi qui porte un vetement de feuilles vertes; 4 l'est se trouve Chennong qui a une collerette et une jupe courte en herbes vertes; a l'ouest, Houang Ti, v6tu d'6toffe: ainsi se marquent les progrks de la civilisation dans l'habillement de plus en plus perfectionn6 de ces trois souverains qui sont h l'origine de l'histoire. Des deux c6tes de la salle sont rang6s les huit Tcha, divinites fort anciennes dont le culte est aujourd'hui encore tres repandu en Chine, mais qui ne nous sont connus que par un texte assez obscur du Li Ki; les huit Tcha semblent etre des divinites agrestes auxquelles sacri- fiaient les paysans quand ils avaient acheve leurs moissons; dans les representations que nous en voyons ici, nous remarquons l'un de ces dieux qui a des crocs redoutables lui sortant de la bouche; peut- &amp;tre est il le tigre auquel les laboureurs sacrifiaient, dit le Li Ki, parce qu'il detruisait les sangliers qui ravagent les champs." (Chavannes, Le T'ai Chan, Ann. du Mus. Guimet, t. XXIX, p. 94). There seems to be every probability that the figure with the fangs is the Tiger-member of the eight protectors enumer- ated in the Li Ki. Fangs are the distinctive feature of the tiger, in the writer's opinion, pace Mr. Davidson, who considers that the ears are most significant. For no other one of the eight Tcha divinities would the "redoubtable" fangs be appropriate. The ancient Tiger-deity has followed a well-known path: "The advance of thought tends to strip the old animal and plant gods of their bestial and vegetable husk, and to leave their human attributes (which are always the kernel of the conception) as the final and sole residuum. In other words, animal and plant gods tend to become purely anthropomorphic." (Frazer, The Golden Bough, Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild, I, 22). Not the least interesting part of M. Chavannes' paragraph is his statement that the cult of the eight Tcha is still widespread in China today; a demonstration of the tremendous vitality of early ideas based on a profound emotional conviction of an indissoluble connection between the intangible and daily life; a demonstration too of the fact that the disappearance of a cult officially never necessarily means its extinction. Continuing "off the record" it may even attain a wider field than the original cult possessed. The outline of the symbolic Tiger's history seems to the writer to be as follows: the pre-agricultural deity, possessed of great powers, was later included in the worship of natural forces. One of the ori- ginal powers, was that of guardian, exemplified by the presence of his image on most of the ritual vessels, and by the fact that such vessels were placed in the ancestral graves. As these were the vessels of an agricultural cult, a connection between the Tiger and agriculture is implied: to the writer it seems a certainty. Somewhere in the course of centuries a split in the powers of the Tiger occurred: the Tiger of the Li Ki is apparently the embodiment only of his agricultural powers. This division continues to the pre- sent. It is interesting to note that the guardian-Tiger today, watching at graves and doorways, his protec- tive head adorning the caps of small boys, has retained the original Tiger-form; while the Tiger of the eight Tcha, embodying the later agricultural powers, is almost as completely anthropomorphised as the jaguar-gods of Quintana Roo. But actually they are still jaguar- and tiger-deities receiving homage as divinities protecting agriculture. 6o</page></plain_text>
