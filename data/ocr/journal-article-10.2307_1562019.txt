<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARMS AND THE MAN: WORDPLAY AND THE CATASTERISM OF CHIRON IN OVID FASTI 5 Barbara Weiden Boyd In a recent essay, Ian Brookes has drawn attention to the way in which Ovid's description of the catasterism of Chiron in Fasti 5 "sup- presses Chiron's hybrid nature" as centaur "in order to allow us to sympathize with him as a fellow human."1 Brookes also directs us to the ironic ambiguity used by Ovid to portray the episode's three main char? acters, Chiron, Achilles, and Hercules, each of whose histories, as alluded to by Ovid, shares with or borrows from the mythical histories of the other two characters.2 Thus, the wordplay associating Chiron's name with the Latin manus (as if derived from %eip), an etymological link already discussed by Santini (1976, 49-56), is demonstrated by Brookes to point instead here to the character of Achilles, whose "man-slaying hands" (xeipocq... dv5poq)6voi)&lt;;) are known from Iliad 18.317 and 24.478-79; the arrow wound in the left foot here fatal to Chiron is suggestive of Achil? les' vulnerable heel; and the poison here responsible for Chiron's death is the same poison that Deianira will one day use to kill Hercules.3 I want in the following discussion to extend the line of argument begun by Brookes through a fuller consideration of Ovid's exploitation of shared motifs in the mythical histories of each of these characters, and to focus in particular on the important role of wordplay, of a sort not previously observed, in the episode. My reading, while demonstrating that Brookes has made a valuable start on the literary analysis of the passage as a whole, will reach a somewhat different conclusion and suggest that Ovid's narrative intentionally subverts the superficial solem- nity of the story told. It will be useful to begin with a full quotation of the episode (Fast. 5.379-414): 1 Brookes 1994, 444-50; this quotation is from 445. 2 Ibid., 448-50. 3 Ibid., 445-49.

This meeting is, as Brookes (1994,496) has observed, "something of a coup": only the most elastic of relative mythological chronologies could permit this meeting to occur. I propose that in fact we take Ovid's videres, appearing immediately after Ovid has set the scene by describing the landscape (379-82) and by introducing each of his three protagonists in three successive couplets (383-88), as an invitation to scrutinize carefully the play with characterization thus made possible, a play signaled first and foremost in this episode through Ovid's use of the epithet semivir (380) to describe Chiron and to set the tone for the events to follow. Ovid's fondness for compound adjectives generally is well known;5 semivir has achieved particular notoriety in the Ovidian lexicon because of its appearance at Ars 2.24 ("semibovemque virum semivirumque bovem"). Its appearance at Fasti 5.380, as Keith has suggested, invites a subtle cross-reference between the Fasti and the Metamorphoses, in the latter of which Chiron is identified as semifer (Met. 2.633).6 The word semivir is clearly intended to evoke a mental picture of the half-anthro- pomorphic Chiron, elsewhere described by Ovid as "pater ... biformis" (Met. 2.664; his daughter Ocyroe is speaking). Its function in Fasti 5 does not, however, end with its visual suggestiveness; instead, Ovid uses the word to introduce a story in which either the humanity or the masculin? ity, or both, of each of the characters comes into question. Ovid also points to this thematic innovation with the second half of the description he gives of Chiron?after learning that he is half-man, we hear that he is also "mixed with the body of a tawny horse" ("flavi corpore mixtus equi"). This odd description points directly to what is likely to be the earliest tradition about Chiron's parentage, known from a scholiast's report that in the cyclic Titanomachia7 Cronus took the form of a horse to sleep with Philyra, daughter of Oceanus, and that from this union was born the hippocentaur Chiron. The distinguished pedigree of this story 5 See, e.g., Kenney 1973, 121-22; Bomer 1958, on Fast. 1.125; Knox 1986, 40; and McKeown 1998,130. 6 Keith 1992a, 78-79 (on the form semifer, see Sommer 1901, 636; Keith 1992a, 78 n.34); semifer is also used to describe centaurs (in the context of Hylonome's wooing of Cyllarus) at Met. 12.406. See Sen. Controv. 2.2.12 for the notoriety of Ars 2.24. 7 Schol. Apollon. Argon. 1.554; the scholiast actually reports that he is citing a Gigantomachia, but editors have generally considered this a mistaken reference to the Titanomachia; the same scholiast also reports a tradition attibuted to Souidas in his Thessalica that Ixion was the father of Chiron and the other centaurs (= FGrHist 602 F 1): see EGFir. F 9 {Titanomachia), and Davies 1989,14. Cf. also Pherec. FGrHist 3 F 50.</page><page sequence="4">70 BARBARA WEIDEN BOYD highlights the lack of tradition behind Ovid's epithet semivir. Ovid does not even implicitly question the animal side of Chiron's nature; he does, however, offer a direct challenge to the tradition of divine parentage and thus undermines any assumptions we might otherwise be inclined to make about this creature. Let us consider exactly what semivir means as applied to Chiron. The epithet functions on one level to designate his half-anthropomorphic body; however, a review of the literary traditions concerning Chiron's parentage and character indicates that Chiron is generally not thought of as half-human at all, but rather as half-god, half-horse. In keeping with the tradition attributed to the Titanomachia, we find Chiron described as cpfip Geioq at Pindar Pythian 4.119. Sophocles too knows of Chiron's divinity (0e6v / Xeipoovoc, Tr. 714-15), although we hear as well here that the poison of Nessus, used by Deianira to kill Hercules, was so strong that it also killed Chiron.8 Most explicit of all, however, is Apollonius, who describes Chiron, son of Cronus and Philyra, as a monstrous crea? ture, half horse, half god: Xetpoovoc 7ceXcbpiov, aXXoc fxev unccp, / aA,Xa 0ecp dxdXavxov (Argon. 2.1240-41). Thus, Ovid's use of semivir to describe Chiron is not simply stylistically predictable?had he wished, Ovid could certainly have written semifer here?but also provocative: the epithet semivir both anticipates the death to come by suppressing Chiron's di? vinity and suggests that we evaluate carefully his mortal manliness. This suggestion is confirmed by the repetition of the syllable vir-, in both true and fanciful cognates, in this scene. At Fasti 5.382, the heights of Pelion, green with pine, are described with language that recalls the appearance of semivir two lines earlier: the pattern of the consonants s, m, v, and r in "summa virent pinu" echoes the unusual epithet. The word vir itself appears next, in reference to Hercules (388): "iussaque restabant ultima paene viro." Vir is then used twice by Chiron, in his one line of direct speech in the episode: he describes the weapons of Hercules and their owner as "vir ... his armis, armaque digna viro!" (394). And finally (403), the poison that overpowers Chiron is itself described as "virus edax." The association of vir with virus is one which Virgil makes in the 8 Sophocles may well be working here from the same tradition that has been used to explain Aeschylus, Prometheus Vinctus 1026-29, where in a vexed passage "some god" (0?(ov xiq) is mentioned as having given his immortality to Prometheus in exchange for the ability to die from his wound. Further on the divinity referred to here, see Robertson 1951, 150-55; Lloyd-Jones 1971, 96-97. Pindar P. 3.1-4 also acknowledges a tradition regarding the death of Chiron.</page><page sequence="5">ARMS AND THE MAN: OVID FASTI 5 71 Georgics, when at 1.58-59 he describes Pontus as productive of "virosa ... / castorea," the medicinal glandular secretion of beavers popularly thought to be sperm. Ross has shown that with the epithet virosum Virgil sug? gests an etymological link between virus (animal sperm, poison) and vir, and that there is "inevitably as well an echo of vires" here.9 Ovid's play with words beginning with vir- is obviously indebted to Virgil, and ap? pears to have been one of which Ovid was particularly fond: Barchiesi has noted variations upon the same wordplay in Metamorphoses 9.152- 62, where Ovid describes the poisoned robe sent by Deianira to Hercules: In cursus animus varios abit: omnibus illis praetulit inbutam Nesseo sanguine vestem mittere, quae vires defecto reddat amori, 155 ignaroque Lichae, quid tradat, nescia luctus ipsa suos tradit blandisque miserrima verbis, dona det illa viro, mandat. capit inscius heros induiturque umeris Lernaeae virus echidnae. tura dabat primis et verba precantia flammis 160 vinaque marmoreas patera fundebat in aras: incaluit vis illa mali resolutaque flammis Herculeos abiit late dilapsa per artus.10 This scene in turn recalls an earlier but parallel version of the story of Hercules' poisoned robe, as reported by Deianira herself in Heroides 9: there, she refers to Nessus as "semivir" (141), and describes the Centaur's charm as possessing "vires amoris" (162). As Barchiesi suggests, the word virus is ironically suppressed in the Heroides version, since Deianira does not know the real power of the poison given her by Nessus.11 Barchiesi also notes in passing that, when Deianira refers to Nessus 9 Ross 1987, 42-43 (although his assertion of inevitability may somewhat overstate the case). See also O'Hara 1996, 254-55. Both Ross and O'Hara observe that vowel-length is immaterial in these cases of etymological wordplay. 10 Barchiesi 1993,341. To Barchiesi's observations here should be added the follow? ing verse, Met. 9.163: "dum potuit, solita gemitum virtute repressit," where virtute effects the same wordplay. 11 Barchiesi 1993,341. For the most recent discussions of the authenticity of Heroides 9, see also Jacobson 1974,228-42; Barchiesi 1993,340-42; and Casali 1995a, esp. 227-33 (an appendix provocatively titled "Lo pseudoproblema dell' autenticita"). While his focus is not Her. 9, Courtney (1998,157-66) has addressed anew the question of the authenticity of certain Heroides, with a brief but pointed comment on Her. 9 at 159-60; and for a thought- ful reevaluation of the issue of authenticity in regard to the double Heroides, see now Kenney 1999.</page><page sequence="6">72 BARBARA WEIDEN BOYD as semivir, there is a touch of irony in her choice of epithet, since before Ovid's use of it to describe centaurs the word semivir carries a negative connotation, denoting a lack of virility.12 The most memorable13 instance of the word is at Aeneid 4.215, in Iarbas' insulting allusion to Aeneas and his companions as "ille Paris cum semiviro comitatu"; this in turn is echoed by Turnus as he charges into battle, hoping to tear the breastplate from the man he considers an effeminate Phrygian ("loricamque manu valida lacerare revulsam / semiviri Phrygis," Aen. 12.98-99). When Ovid shifts the epithet's frame of reference in Fasti 5 from ethnic slur to physical description, then, its earlier connotation naturally lingers in its now-ironic application to a centaur, here brought low not in a battle of epic proportions but in what should have been a merry meeting, instead cut short by foolish inadvertence. Meanwhile, on a number of different levels the epithet is also de? scriptive of Chiron's two guests and their shared relationship with him; Ovid will exploit this interrelationship subtly but suggestively. We have already seen that the word semivir serves as a sort of ironic foreboding of Chiron's incongruous demise; conversely, Achilles and Hercules are in? deed technically semiviri, "half-human," insofar as each has both a divine and a human parent. Ovid also emphasizes the youth of both Hercules and Achilles: the former is welcomed by Chiron as iuvenis (391), and the latter is twice called puer (390,400); neither is a vir in his prime. Chiron, by contrast, is repeatedly identified as senex (384, 397), and his role as surrogate father to Achilles is emphasized at the close of the scene, when we hear that Achilles wept as he would weep were he to see his father Peleus like this (407-8); he even addresses Chiron as "care . . . pater" (412).14 We have, then, a scene in which the tutelage of a young hero by his wise mentor, generally a fundamental and formative civilizing expe? rience, is not reinforced by the accidental visit of Hercules, hero par excellence, but goes terribly (and incongruously) wrong. The ostensibly perfect moment of male bonding evoked at the opening of the scene concludes abruptly in disaster. Earlier literary traditions associating either Achilles or Hercules 12 Barchiesi 1993, 341 n. 9. One of the anonymous readers for AJP suggests that there may be an ironic hint, too, here at the fact that Nessus' attempt at rape emphasizes the all-too-human nature of this centaur. 13 And, aside from its appearance in a fragment of Varro's Saturae Menippeae (fr. 132 Buecheler = Riese p.132), its first extant appearance in Latin literature. 14 Brookes 1994,445-47; cf. Keith (1992a, 78), who notes the parallelism with Ocyroe's address to Chiron at Met. 2.649 as "care pater."</page><page sequence="7">ARMS AND THE MAN: OVID FASTI 5 73 with Chiron also suggest the possibilities for irony in a narrative rendez- vous of the three characters. In his Geryoneis, Stesichorus appears to have mentioned the giving of wine to Hercules by the centaur Pholus (PMG 181);Theocritus 7.149-50 expands on this tradition and associates Chiron with Pholus by making reference to the hospitality offered to Hercules by Chiron in Pholus' cave; and Diodorus Siculus 4.12.8 at? tempts to sort out the two similar tales, reporting that Pholus, Hercules' host, was accidentally killed by one of Hercules' arrows when the wild centaurs invaded Pholus' home; likewise, says Diodorus, Hercules acci? dentally shot and killed the healer Chiron.15 Achilles, meanwhile, is as a baby entrusted by his father, Peleus, to the tutelage of Chiron, in a tradition that is certainly as early as Hesiod (Cat. fr. 204.87-89 M-W)16 and that is at least implied by Homer at Iliad 11.830-32.17 For Pindar, Chiron's role as teacher of Achilles is a useful exemplum in epinician (N. 3.43-49; P. 6.21-63). This tradition is then exploited by Apollonius, who depicts Achilles as a small child in Chiron's care at the time of the Argo's maiden voyage (Argon. 1.553-58; cf. 4.811-13), while Hercules has a heroic cameo in the same poem (his disappearance from the voyage is addressed at 1.1290-95; cf.Theocr. 13.66-71).18 When Ovid makes a con? nection between the two heroes that brings them together in Chiron's cave, he appears to be exploiting an alternative tradition: we learn from Pseudo-Eratosthenes Catasterismoi 40 that, in his Herakles, the Sophist Antisthenes, colleague of Socrates, depicted Hercules following Achilles to Chiron's cave out of love (8i' epooxoc) and in order to "be with" (cruveivoci) him.19 Pseudo-Eratosthenes also mentions that in this version 15 Cf., e.g., Epicharmus CGF 78 (a comedy on the visit of Heracles to Chiron); Aristophanes PCG 3.2, pp. 159-63 K-A; Apollod. 2.5.4; Hyg. Astr. 2.38.1 (apparently follow? ing Ovid); Pliny HN 25.66. 16 Cf. also a work ascribed to Hesiod by the name Instructions of Chiron (Xeipcovoq Tjco&amp;nicai, fr. 283-85 M-W). 17 For a valuable discussion of the references to Chiron in the Iliad, see Mackie 1997, 1?10; this essay is in part a response to Griffin (1977,39-53 esp. 40-41), who sees the virtual exclusion of Chiron from the Iliad as typical of Homer's avoidance of the fantastic. 18 See also Feeney 1986, 47-85, on the programmatic role of Hercules in the Argonautica. 19 The ambiguity of cruveivcu makes it quite possible that Antisthenes in fact de? scribed a sexual rendezvous between the two heroes, although this is not made explicit in Pseudo-Eratosthenes' summary. I am grateful to one of the anonymous readers for AJP for bringing to my attention the reference to Antisthenes in Pseudo-Eratosthenes Cat. 40, as well as the existence of a fourth-century a.d. mosaic from Algeria depicting the threesome Chiron, Achilles, and Hercules together. This mosaic (illustrated at LIMC 3.2, Chariklo 1,8;</page><page sequence="8">74 BARBARA WEIDEN BOYD one of Hercules' arrows accidentally fell from his quiver, fatally wound- ing Chiron. Ovid, then, suppresses any explicitly erotic motif that may have been part of the earlier scene in Antisthenes but develops the accidental wounding as the result of clumsy behavior, although on whose part is unclear. Hercules, it is true, sometimes becomes a drunken buf- foon elsewhere,20 and in at least Diodorus' version of events, Hercules' killing of Chiron is a disturbing accident. Yet in the Fasti 5 episode Ovid makes no mention of wine?logically, the cause of trouble in the version of events in which Pholus' cave was invaded by the other centaurs and he was killed accidentally by Hercules. This narrative detail too was already available to Ovid, yet he suppresses this information as well in his ver? sion of events. Instead, responsibility for the death, accidental or other? wise, of Chiron is removed from Hercules by Ovid; in Fasti 5, it is actually Chiron himself who seems directly responsible for dropping the arrow on his left foot, although he does so in the course of joining Achilles in examining Hercules' weapons ("dumque senex tractat squalentia tela venenis, / excidit et laevo fixa sagitta pede est," 397-98). The epithet semivir and the wordplay associated with it also draw our attention to the masculinity of Achilles and Hercules: in fact, in at least one other mythical episode in the case of each hero, both are notorious cross-dressers, though otherwise depicted in their careers as paragons of military excellence and masculine bravura. Hercules' servi? tude to the Lydian queen Omphale was familiar to Ovid's audience first and foremost from Propertius' treatment of the story in elegy 4.9, where Hercules mentions the episode in a list of his heroic credentials in the vain hope of gaining admission to the spring in the shrine of Bona Dea.21 Ovid himself tells the tale, in much greater detail, at Fasti 2.303-58, ostensibly as an aetiology to explain why the Luperci do their ritual run virtually naked.22 There, Ovid begins by alerting his audience to the fact cf. also LIMC 1.1, Achilleus 84; LIMC 3.2, Cheiron 95) is puzzling: its combination of these three characters with several other figures, including a number of females, has not made an association of the mosaic with Antisthenes' tale self-evident. 20 See Galinsky 1972, 81-100. 21 For fuller discussion, see Anderson 1964,1-12; Cairns 1992, 65-103; DeBrohun 1994, 41-63 (esp. 45-51 and 58-61); and Lindheim 1998, 43-66. Hercules' servitude to Omphale is already a part of his story in Soph. Trach., although the cross-dressing episode is not mentioned in this play: see Davies 1991, xxii-xxx; cf. Kirk 1974,197-98, and Loraux 1990, 21-52. 22 For a full discussion, see Fantham 1983, 185-216 (esp. 192-201). Cf. also Her. 9.53-118.</page><page sequence="9">ARMS AND THE MAN: OVID FASTI 5 75 that the tale is a humorous one ("antiqui fabula plena ioci," 304). He then offers a detailed list of the clothes Hercules and Omphale exchange as they literally cross-dress: he takes her tunic and belt, bracelets and shoes (319-24), while she takes his club, lion skin, and the weapons in his quiver: "ipsa capit clavamque gravem spoliumque leonis / conditaque in pharetra tela minora sua," 2.325-26. In Fasti 5, it is Chiron semivir who shows great interest in virtually the same list of equipment: "respicit interea clavam spoliumque leonis," 393;"tractat squalentia tela venenis," 397 23 while Achilles singles out Hercules' bristling fleece (395-96). We never see or hear in this scene anything concerning Hercules' reaction to this interest; the implied parallel with his cross-dressing interlude with Omphale in Fasti 2, however, is cleverly anticipated by Ovid when he introduces Hercules into the Fasti 5 episode, on his way back from some of his labors; just a few tasks remain ("iussaque restabant ultima paene viro," 5.388). The juxtaposition of the words paene and viro and the anastrophe of ultima and paene suggest two different interpretations of this line: "almost the last labors remained for the man," or "the last labors remained for the almost-man." If we follow the latter line of interpretation, however momentarily,24 we are reminded by Ovid that, at one point in his career, Hercules was indeed an "almost-man"; the last time he gave up his weapons for inspection, at least in the course of the Fasti, was when he took Omphale's clothes in their place. The latter line of interpretation also invites at least momentary consideration of Her? cules' eventual divine translation?the same character who in one epi? sode in his mythical life plays the role of woman instead of man will later in his career play the role of god instead of man. A complementary tale, meanwhile, exists concerning Achilles? that is, a tale in which, already dressed as a girl, he reveals his true masculine nature by reaching for men's weapons rather than womanish ornaments. I refer, of course, to the tradition concerning Thetis' attempt to keep Achilles out of the Trojan war by entrusting him to Lycomedes, king of Scyrus, who raises Achilles, dressed in a girl's clothing, together with his daughter(s). It thus serves as an alternative of sorts to the 23 At Her. 9.115-18, Deianira uses similar language to describe how Omphale reached for Hercules' weapons: "femina tela tulit Lernaeis atra venenis, / ferre gravem lana vix satis apta colum, / instruxitque manum clava domitrice ferarum, / vidit et in speculo coniugis arma mei!" On the importance of Omphale in Her. 9, see Jacobson 1974,237-41, and Casali 1995b, 505-9. 24 Cf. ex Pont. 4.3.12, "paene puer puero iunctus amicitia," noted by Kroll 1980 on Cat. 31.1.</page><page sequence="10">76 BARBARA WEIDEN BOYD tradition concerning Chiron's tutelage, Ovid's ostensible focus. This al- ternative story, while apparently avoided by Homer, was at least men? tioned in the Cypria.25 It is reported by Pausanias to have been depicted in a painting in the Propylaea by Polygnotus,26 and was also the subject of Euripides' lost play Skyrioi (PSI1286).27 Horace uses it as a humorous exemplum with which to conclude Odes 1.8, addressed to Lydia.28 Ovid alludes to it on several occasions in other poems besides the Fasti?in Ars 1.689-702 (where it is introduced with the words "fabula nota quidem")29 and Metamorphoses 13.162-70.30 In the latter passage, Ulysses uses his discovery of Achilles amongst the girls ("arma ego femineis animum motura virilem / mercibus inserui," Met. 13.165-66) to support his claim that he deserves to be awarded Achilles' arms?because he is responsible for Achilles' participation in the war, Achilles' many victo? ries are Ulysses', too: "ergo opera illius mea sunt" (Met. 13.171). In Ars 1, Ovid describes how Achilles took advantage of his transvestism to rape the daughter of Lycomedes, who shared Achilles' bedroom. In this ver? sion of the story,31 Ovid devotes much attention to the fact that the girlish activity with which Achilles busies himself while in disguise is spinning and wool-work (Ars 1.691-96): 25 At //. 9.668, Achilles is conqueror of Scyrus; cf. also EGFir. F 4a (Ilias Parva). The scholia on //. 9.668 reject the tale of Achilles in girl's clothes, though his rape of the daughter of Lycomedes and the resulting birth of Pyrrhus were found in the Cypria: see EGFir. inc. loc. 4 (scholiast on //. 19.326) and Griffin 1977,44 (who cites E. Bethe, Homer [2d ed., Leipzig, 1929] 2.2, fr. 13.2). 26 Paus. 1.22.6 (speaking of Homer): eu 8e um cpaivexai Tioifiaai Iicupov imo ''A%iMiax; atawaav, oi)8ev ouxriax; Kai oaoi ^eyo\)aiv 6|io\) xaiq 7iap9evoi&lt;; 'AxiM-ea e'xew ev lKt)pcp 8{aixav, a 5f| Kai noMryvarax; eypayev.

See further Nisbet and Hubbard 1970 on Od. 1.8.1 and 13. 29 Also discussed by DeBrohun 1994, 59-60, in connection with Prop. 4.9, although she does not mention the relationship between the Ovidian version and [Bion] 2, which though fragmentary clearly describes the beginning of Achilles' seduction of the daughter of Lycomedes and served as a model for Ovid: see Hollis 1977 on Ars 1.681-704 and Appendix 5. 30 In both episodes, play with words containing vi- or vir- is found: virilem (Met. 13.165) and virgineos (Met. 13.167); virum (Ars 1.690), virgo (Ars 1.697), virum (Ars 1.698), viribus . . . victa (Ars 1.699), vinci viribus (Ars 1.700), and vis (Ars 1.703). 31 See also Davies 1989, 44-45 and EGF fr. inc. loc. 4.</page><page sequence="11">ARMS AND THE MAN: OVID FASTI 5 77 quid facis, Aeacide? non sunt tua munera lanae; tu titulos alia Palladis arte petes. quid tibi cum calathis? clipeo manus apta ferendo est; pensa quid in dextra, qua cadet Hector, habes? reice succinctos operoso stamine fusos: quassanda est ista Pelias hasta manu. The prolepsis which works here to anticipate the events of the Iliad in the words "dextra, qua cadet Hector" (694) is similar to that found at Fasti 5.385, "manus olim missuras Hectora leto";32 and the devotion to wool-work which characterizes the Achilles of Ars 1 is echoed at Fasti 5.395-96. There we hear that what Achilles cannot be restrained from reaching for first are not the club and quiver of Hercules, but rather the bristly fleece Hercules wears: "nec se, quin horrens auderent tangere saetis / vellus, Achilleae continuere manus." With this detail, Ovid neatly trumps the contrast between masculine and feminine spheres of interest and propriety?now the future Hector-slayer is not made to hide his masculinity under Lycomedes' care (indeed, this event too lies in Achil? les' future), but to nurture it under Chiron's. And so he reaches for the lion's fleece not to spin its wool like a girl but to admire it as a symbol of heroic virility. The desire behind his action remains ambiguous, however, and so suggests a conflation of the two variant narratives concerning Achilles' childhood. Mutatis mutandis, the Achilles raised by Chiron and the one raised by Lycomedes are really not so different after all. A final detail in this scene serves as an appropriate conclusion: I refer to Chiron's ironic words describing Hercules and his weapons, "vir ... his armis, armaque digna viro!" (394). As Brookes (1994, 448) com? ments, the words of Chiron are "ironically prophetic": Chiron semivir is in fact "unfit to handle the arms of Hercules." In fact, the handling of Hercules' arms, which symbolize Hercules' heroic exploits but are incon- gruous intruders in this determinedly unheroic scene, is a disturbing indication that the heroic masculinity of all the characters in this scene is somehow compromised by their meeting. With the singsong repetition of arma and vir created by antimetabole,33 Chiron's line also cannot help but provoke in the minds of Ovid's readers reminiscence of another hero, whose reputation as semivir, at least among his rivals, has already been noted above, and whose worthiness to carry the weapons made for 32 See also Ars 1.15-16 describing Achilles' tutelage under Chiron: "quas Hector sensurus erat, poscente magistro / verberibus iussas praebuit ille manus." 33 Cf.

While Virgil's Aeneas had followed in the footsteps of Achilles and Hercules, the two young heroes depicted by Ovid are hardly of epic stature, whatever Chiron may think. At the opening of Amores 1.1 ("arma gravi numero"),34 Ovid had recalled the opening of the Aeneid only to turn away from its potential as literary role model; now, in an even closer echo of Virgil's "arma virumque cano," Ovid cleverly subverts the heroic code.35 Ovid suggests that, somewhat like Aeneas, Achilles and Hercules are ambiguous heroes indeed; their "meeting of the minds" brings about, however inadvertently, the demise of their beloved teacher, surrogate father, and host. Ironically, through his catasterism Chiron is freed by virus from the epithet semivir, in both its positive and negative connota- tions; our last view of Achilles and Hercules, however, is as two heroes whose careers as semiviri are not yet entirely behind them, trapped in the fractured narrative of the Fasti?6 Bowdoin College e-mail: bboyd@bowdoin.edu BIBLIOGRAPHY Anderson, W.
