<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-CRITICAL NOTICES. The WTill to Believe; and other Essays in Popular Philosophy. By WILLIAM JAMES. London, New York and Bombay: Long- mans, Green &amp; Co. Pp. xvii., 332. AT the risk of seeming to use the language of extravagant eulogy I should like to call this collection of Prof. James' essays a wholly admirable book, alike in form and in matter. That the form of any of Prof. James' literary productions should be deserving of the highest praise was indeed no more than would be anticipated by all who had ever enjoyed the grace of his style, the raciness of his phrases, the stimulus of his originality, in short the deft- ness of the manipulations whereby he is wont to charm the heavy indigestible dough of philosophic discussion to rise up into dainty shapes that need be disdained by no intellectual epicure. But it is the matter even more than the manner of Prof. James' teachings that renders his volume a delight to all lovers of philosophic literature. That a volume of essays on various topics, ranging in date from 1879-96, should possess a substantial unity surpassing that of many formal treatises is indeed a marvel, explained only by the fact in this case that they are welded together by the unity of a strong and picturesque personality. But the attitude towards philosophic problems taken up in these essays seems to me more remarkable even than the unity given to them by Prof. James' pprsonality, and in a technical journal it is the more necessary to lay stress on this point as its importance is otherwise likely to be cloaked by the literary charm of Prof. James' manner, by his avoidance of cumbrous technicalities and formal elaboration, and by the engaging frankness and modesty with which he pretends only to express his personal feelings. There is a real danger that professed philosophers should come to believe that nothing can be profound but what is obscurely put, and that they should con- sequently pass over too- lightly the lucidity which seems to reveal the depths of philosophic problems even to the uninitiated. Prof. James' essays are popular in this highest sense, that they can arouse the enthusiasm of the many without ceasing to stimulate the few. And yet he in no wise departs from the doctrine of sound science which he has expounded so brilliantly in his Principles of Psychology. It is true that,we here have Prof. James making</page><page sequence="2">548 CRITICAL NOTICES: incursions into the territory of general philosophy, but his pre- liminary raids give such promise of solid conquests, if ever he should find the leisure to advance in full array, that the opponents of his metaphysical views would be very ill-advised if they did not make use of the present opportunity in order to prepare them- selves betimes to resist the coming onslaught. The philosophic significance of the views sketched in Prof. James' present volume seems to me to reside chiefly in the fact that they mark a further step in the modern reaction against a one-sided and reckless rationalism-a reaction which bids fair ultimately to reconcile philosophy with common sense. That re- action has generally appealed.to the will for a title wherewith to check the vagaries of the " intellectus sibi permissus ". The fashion was set by Schopenhauer's Will-to-live, continued in Mainlauder's Will-to-die, travestied in Nietzsche's Will-to-power, and last but not least, albeit in a somewhat different sense, Prof. James draws our attention to the importance of the Will-to-believe. For the selection of the title of the first essay to be the title of the whole volume is significant. That believe we must, but that as to the content and manner of our belief we are far freer than we have been taught to believe, is the pivot upon which Prof. James' thought revolves. Thus the book becomes a declaration of tha independence of the concrete whole of man, with all his passions and emotions unexpurgated, directed against the cramping rules and regulations by which the Brahmins of the academic caste are tempted to impede the free expansion of human life. The great lesson it illustrates in various forms is that wisdom as well as dining is often a matter of great daring, and that there are not really any eternal and non-human truths to prohibit us from adopting the beliefs we need to live by, nor any infallible a priori test of truth to screen us from the consequences of our choice. Now that seems a most salutary doctrine to preach to a biped oppressed by many., -ologies,' like modern man, and calculated to allay his growing doubts whether he has a responsible personality and a soul and conscience of his own, and is not a mere phantas- magoria of abstractions, a transient complex of shadowy formulas. that science calls ' the laws of nature'. As against the worship of such ' idols of Xthe theatre,' Prof. James most opportunely remind&amp; us that abstractions are made by men and for men and not men for abstractions, that they become not venerable but execrable when their origin is forgotten and the function for the sake of which they were formed is neglected. ' Pure' science in short is. pure bosh, if by purity be meant abstraction from all human purposes and freedom fromi all emotional interest. Prof. James himself describes his attitude as a " radical em- pi4scism" (p. ix.)-em?priccism, because he is " contented to regard its most assured conclusions concerning matters of fact as hypo- theses liable to be modified in the course of future experience," and radical, because he will not take anything for granted, not.</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM JAMES, The Will to Believe. 549 even that the universe is a universe in any debatable sense (p. 68). For he will not allow that anything has been determined by calling the world a universe, so long as the infinite alternatives to which the term might apply are not rendered definite by a de- scription of the particular universe intended. Hence he will not "dogmatically affirm monism as something with which all ex- perience has to square," but accepts " the opacity of the finite facts as given," and " the crudity of experience remains an eternal element thereof". But if so, he must needs be a pluralist, on the ground that " there is no possible point of view from which the world can appear as an absolutely single fact. Real possibilities, real indeterminations, real beginnings, real ends, real evil, real crises, catastrophies and escapes, a real God, and a real moral life, just as common sense conceives these things, may remain in empiricism as conceptions which philosophy gives up the attempt either to 'overcome' or to reinterpret in monistic form " (p. ix.). These are brave words and of the happiest augury; for they may mean the dawn of an era in which teleological postulates will be admitted to underlie all human activities, when consequently the postulates of man's knowing activities will be subjected to as candid a criticism as the implications of his feelings and actions, and when their subordination to the needs and aims of the whole organism will win due recognition. The paper on " The Will to Believe " strikes Prof. James' key- note boldly by declaring that in all cases of genuine option between intellectual alternatives-that is in all cases where both alter- natives appeal to us in any way-our decision not only lawfully may but must be made by our passional nature. It is idle in such cases to avoid decision by suspense of judgment; for though we may thus escape error, we also lose our chance of gaining truth. Very often, as is well illustrated by the Alpine climber in a desperate case, to refuse a decision is itself a decision; the climber must leap to safety or perish (p. 59). In such cases he who hesitates is lost, while conversely faith "creates its own verification," so that " the thought becomes literally father to the fact as the wish was father to the thought" (p. 103). Hence Prof. James " cannot see his way to accept the agnostic rules for truth-seeking or wilfully agree to keep his willing nature out of the game ". For "a rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent one from acknowledging certain kinds of truth, if those kinds of truth were really there, would be an irrational rule" (p. 28). And the more so if it is realised that it is not really a question of intellect versus feelings, but of intellect plus one passion, " the horror of becoming a dupe," versus the rest. The truth is that the intellect is entirely built up of practical interests, cognition is but "4a cross-section at a certain point of what in its totality is a motor phenomenon," and "incomplete until discharged in act" (pp. 84-5). " Conceptions, 'kinds,' are teleological instruments," " every way of classifying a thing is but</page><page sequence="4">550 CRITICAL NOTICES: a way of handling it for a particular purpose," " no abstract con- cept can be a valid substitute for a concrete reality except with reference to a particular interest in the conceiver " (p. 70). It should be recognised that the adoption of the evolutionist standpoint and acceptance of a reflex-action theory of mind commits us to "re- garding the mind as an essentially teleological mechanism," so that "the conceiving or theorising faculty functions exclusively for the sake of ends that do not exist at all in the world of impressions we receive by way of our senses, but are set by our emotional and practical subjectivity " (p. 117). The sciences, in short, are thoroughly teleological at bottom; their " purpose is to conceive simply and to foresee" (p. 119). In so doing they may abstract from teleology, as from anything else, but the abstraction is itself teleological. The doctrine of the mind's functioning which Prof. James urges in these terms is, of course, one which may easily be misrepre- sented as a new piece of theological obscurantism, intended to palliate the substitution of blind faith for disinterested adhesion to truth at whatever cost; and as it will certainly suit the purposes of some so to misunderstand it, that misrepresentation may almost be regarded as an accomplished fact. Yet it deserves to be pointed out that Prof. James' actual doctrine is not altogether new and almost indisputably true. The observation possunt quia posse videntur did not escape the sagocity of antiquity. And that the mind must be treated as a thoroughly teleological instrument is a ;conclusion which all modern science renders inevitable. Biologi- cally, the brain is primarily an exceedingly plastic organ for effecting exceedingly varied adaptations to the organism's ends and conditions of life: it would seem to follow at once that the mind's action must be teleologically vitiated throughout, and that there is not the slightest antecedent reason for supposing'that it functions satisfactorily except with reference to the practical needs of the organism. If then there existed absolute truth, of which man was not the measure, it would be most natural that the human mind should prove inadequate to its comprehension. But fortunately there is no ground for the assertion of any such abso- lute truth. What passes for such is itself an abstraction, which may have its'proper function in the system of human ends, or may be perverted, like other aberrant instincts, into a mod-e of function- ing useless, and even dangerous, to the whole organism. We are shut up then in a thoroughly anthropomorphic view of our ex- perience. But it is an unwarrantable inference that such a view is not adequate to our- needs. And it seems a most valuable suggestion of Prof. James' that we may often make it adequate by trying and by proceeding on the assumption that it is adequate. Whether e.g. the world is knowable or not may be, like the question whether life is or is not worth living (p. 60), one of the truths that become true by our faith (p. 96), one of the cases where " our personal response,", the eye with which we regard the</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM JAMES, The WTill to Believe. 551 facts, may make all the difference. Certainly this suggestion will go some way towards explaininig the strange divergence of the estimates of the world which are come to by different persons and' in different sciences. For it is not the least factor in the relief held out to us by Prof. James' doctrine that it emancipates us from the superstition that our sciences set forth a rigid, unbending and unhuman order of fact which our volitions and emotions fret against in vain. The sciences appear simply as methods of transmuting the given- ness of facts into shapes subservient to our various purposes, and their 'principles' are adopted ad hoc. They may be as various as those purposes and as numerous as the sciences, though there is a natural tendency for the methods and assumptions of the pre- dominant science to infect the rest. As Prof. James says, they are " chapters in the great jugglery which our conceiving faculty is for ever playing with the order of being as it presents itself" (p. 129), and it is a poor juggler that is taken in by his own tricks. There is no abstract sacrosanctity about the rules of science, and it may well be that " to the end of time our power of moral and volitional response to the nature of things will be the deepest organ of communication therewith we shall ever possess " (p. 141). Such sayings should not be taken as derogatory to the majesty of science, but they contain a much-needed vindication of the rights of man, the maker of all sciences. This doctrine of the function of faith, so far considered, per- vBdes not only the essay on " The Will to Believe," but also those entitled " The Sentiment of Rationality," " Reflex Action and Theism," " Is Life worth Living? " and " The Dilemma of Deter- minism ". The last of these also defends the interesting position that the alternative to determinism, viz., the reality of chance, in the end amounts only to an assertion of pluralism. It implies that the universe is not a rigidly and unalterably connected whole in which everything is fore-ordained and no windfall can cause an agreeable surprise, but rather " a joint stock society in which the sharers have both limited liabilities and limited powers" (p. 154), and " no part can claim to control absolutely the destinies of the whole" (p. 159). And inasmuch as after the event the universe with chance in it appears to the determinist eye as quite as rational as that which admitted of no contingency (p. 156), the question is theoretically insoluble (p. 159). No wonder then that as a matter of personal taste Prof. James prefers " a world with a chance in it of being altogether good" (p. 178) to a thoroughly determined world " of wh-ich either sin or error forms a necessary part ". (p. 164). In reality, however, Prof. James would seem to understate his case. Once more the solution of the antinomy lies in 'observing the methodological character of the determinist assumption. The assumption is made for certain purposes of ours in order to render events calculable, but it would be absurd on that account to attribute to- it an absolute validity and to</page><page sequence="6">552 CRITICAL NOTICES: deprive ourselves of the ethical stimulus of an indeterminism that holds out the prospect of a victory over evil. The same point is urged with great force in the good-humoured attack on Hegel's system entitled " On some Hegelisms " where " the pure plethora of necessary being with the oxygen of possibility all suffocated out of its lungs" is shown to render im- possible all good or bad, and to reduce all things to " one dead level of mere fate" (p. 292). The method of Hegel, whom Prof. James playfully calls " a philosophic desperado," whose career is. " one series of outrages upon the chastity of thought" (p. 274), seems to him to consist essentially of a refusal to disttngu'ish, which enables to take what is true of a term secutndum quid, to treat it a$ true of the same term simpliciter and then to apply it to the term secundum aliud (p. 280). And, he adds, in certain stages of nitrous oxide intoxication similar Hegelisms may be produced almost automatically. ; The essay on " The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life" con- tains the noticeable points that there is no abstract good or moral order per se, that " without a claim actually made by some con- crete person there can be no obligation, but that there is some obligation wherever there is a claim" (p. 194), that consequently wrongness does not become " more acceptable or intelligible when we imagine it to consist in the laceration of an a priori ideal order than in the disappointment of a living personal God" (p. 196). The best world imaginable is that which satisfies all claims (p. 202), the best attainable that which satisfies as many demands as possible (p. 205), since " the essence of good is simply to satisfy demand" (p. 201). It would surely dissipate many atrocities of ethical theory to have it recognised that no moral order can be perfect that leaves unsatisfied the claims of any moral being how- ever humble; yet it would seem that Prof. James somewhat exaggerates when he declares (p. 201) that "the various ideals have no common character apart from the fact that they are ideals". If that were so, the ' chance of a world altogether good' would be a poor one; but we may surely indulge in the thought (and so perhaps transmute it into fact!) that the various claims of the various beings may be made to converge into forms which are no 'longer mutually destructive. The essays on " Great Men and their Environment " and " The Importance of Individuals" form eloquent protests against the mis- application of evolutionist principles which leads to the minimising of the function of great men. Great men are produced by physio- logical causes so remote from any traceable influence of the en- -vironment that they must from the point of view of the latter be regarded as ' accidental'. Yet their action often twists the course of history and gives it a direction in which it flows for ever after. H6nce Prof. James confesses himself a hero-worshipper, malgre tout, and subscribes with all his heart to the remark of his car- pentur Ithat "there is very little difference between one man</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM JAMES, The Will to Believe. 553 and another; but what little there is, is very impnortant" (p. 256). The volume closes with an essay on the work of the Society for Psychical Research, which not only forms a chivalrous defence of a much and maliciously maligned subject, but also gives what is probably the best brief account of the achievements and aims of the little band of dauntless workers who have not feared the de- filement of their academic robes by the pitch of superstition, if perchance they might extract coal-tar products of value from the uninviting waste of vagrant fancy. It seems possible that eventu- ally-let us say towards the latter end of the twentieth century- they will have their reward, and be numbered among the heroes and martyrs of a more catholic science, as the pioneers of truths that have a more direct bearing on human welfare than any other; but at present it is probably more profitable to emphasise Prof. James' ingenious suggestion that the believers in the occult of all sorts are in reality instinctive rebels against the abstraction from personality which science commits in its anxiety to arrive at universal laws. Such persons take a personal and romantic view of life, and believe that events are respecters of persons. And, curiously enough, experience to some extent bears them out, as to a large extent it bears out the scientific disregard of par- ticularity. And they may be right, wholly or in part, for philo- sophically "personality is the only complete category of our thinking ". Prof. James' explanation is so ingenious that one hesitates to criticise it as rather far-fetched; no doubt the abstraction from personality renders science more and more unsatisfactory the higher it rises, no doubt also belief auid disbelief in the personal significance of events may to some extent construct their own verification after the fashion indicated in Prof. James' earlier essays; yet it would seem to be confidence in their real or imaginary personal experience rather than in the authority of science, and not any more recondite considerations, that actuates believers in the supernormal. Moreover if they and Prof. James happened to be right in their diagnosis, the outlook for psychical research would be even gloomier than it is. For the Society for Psychical Research was founded for the purpose of treating these experiences in accordance with the recognised procedure of the other sciences. If then their character were essentially personal, they would baffle the methods of science as such. Still we have to thank Prof. James for the idea, which suggests the further corollary that the real reason why ordinarily the ' universal law' operates so successfully, why the natural order seems to be no respecter of persons, is that personality is not yet sufficiently developed and that persons are not yet sufficiently differentiated to render it unprofitable to group them together. In drawing attention to the manifold suggestiveness of Prof. James' work I have not gone out of my way to quote his numerous</page><page sequence="8">554 CRITICAL NOTICES: epigrams, in spite of the temptation of constructing out of them a very delightful anthology. But though he has thrown his bomb shells into the stifling aura which surrounds many a hoary prejudice of the philosophic world, yet I firmly believe that, like the book as a whole, they will be found in the end to have con- tained nothing but the purest ozone, to freshen and cleanse the atmosphere of life.
