<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT RICHARD M. GALE Is it possible for a cause to be later than its effect? x It is true but unhelpful to reply that this is logically impossible since it is an analytic truth that a cause cannot be later than its effect. The reason why this reply is unhelpful is that it does nothing towards answering the question of whether or not we could alter this analytic truth by suitably changing the rules for the use of the word "cause" and still have a recognizable analog of our present concept of causality. If certain bizarre things, such as are depicted in paranormal psychology and science fiction, were to happen, might it not be reasonable to liberalize our concept of causality so that while it is still required that a cause be uniformly connected with its effect and could be used to bring its effect about, etc., it is no longer required that a cause cannot be later than its effect? The question, then, is not whether there could be a counter-example to the analytic truth that a cause cannot be later than its effect, which, of course, is logically impossible, but whether there could be a counter-stipulation-example to this analytic truth, i.e., a description of a constant conjunction between events which is of such a sort so as to justify our giving up this analytic truth.2 1 The following authors deal with this question: M.

GALE The aim of this paper will be to try and show why there could not be any acceptable counter-stipulation-example to this analytic truth. The overall strategy will be to articulate the conceptual centrality of this analytic truth by showing that a change in it will cause absurdities to break out in certain neighboring concepts with which the concept of cause has logical liaisons, such as action, pos sibility, intention, deliberation, memory, responsibility, and punishment: and when we try to protect ourselves from these absurdities by altering these latter concepts as well, we will have twisted our concept of causality, along with these other concepts, out of recognition. In other words, it will be argued that to give up this analytic truth will require such a drastic overhauling of the basic concepts of our conceptual system that they will not be a recognizable analog of their former self. Obviously, I cannot give any precise criterion for just when an altered concept ceases to be a permissible analog of its former self. While there is room for dis agreement about these matters, we can reach agreement upon the logical connections between the concept of causality and these other neighboring concepts, so that we can determine what changes must be made in the latter so as to accommodate a change in the former. Whether we then wish to say that these changes are so extensive that these concepts are not permissible analogs of their former selves is of secondary importance. However, I do believe that it can be shown that the extended concept of causality which permits a cause to be later than its effect requires such a drastic change in neighboring concepts that there will be little room for disagreement as to whether it is a legitimate analog to the original concept of causality. could give up this analytic truth involves acceptance of some form of the conventionalistic theory of necessity; however, the same sort of question could be raised if we operated with a platonic theory of necessity. Since the platonist denies that necessity is dependent in any way on linguistic rules, he would not allow us to speak of denying, or giving up, an analytic truth by changing linguistic rules. In regard to cases (e.g., non-Euclidean geom etry) where supposed analytic truths were denied, he would say that this shows only that they really were not analytic truths but only believed to be such. But, then, we could raise the question of whether the claim that a cause cannot be later than its effect really is an analytic truth or is only believed to be one.</page><page sequence="3">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 211 To bring out the conceptual centrality of the analytic truth that a cause cannot be later than its effect, or, in tensed termi nology, that a present event cannot be the cause of a past event, we shall try to devise a counter-stipulation-example to this truth and shall note what corresponding conceptual reforms it requires us to make. But before doing this it will be necessary, first, to make some preliminary remarks about causality, and, second, to lay down certain necessary conditions which must be fulfilled by any successful counter-stipulation-example. I. Preliminary Analysis of Causation Fortunately, for our purposes it will not be necessary to define "cause"; but it will be essential to distinguish, on the one hand, between a proximate and a remote cause, and, on the other, be tween a cause and a mere condition. A proximate cause is a cause (in some undefined sense) which bears one of the following three temporal relations to its effect: (1) it can be simultaneous with its effect (to be called a "proximate causei") ; (2) it can be temporally contiguous with its effect (to be called a "proximate cause2") ; or (3) it can be temporally separated from its effect by initiating some process that in the normal course of things terminates in its effect (to be called "proximate cause3"). The best way to bring out the differences between these three types of proximate cause is to con sider some examples of each. When a lead ball is released on a not too tightly packed sand bag it immediately begins to indent this bag and continues to do so until the ball ceases to fall because of some counter-acting force. The falling of the lead ball is a process which is the proximate causei of the indenting of the bag since these two processes are coterminus. Similarly, the movement of the sculptor's hands is the proximate cause! of the changing in shape of the block of clay. In cases of proximate causationi it might seem arbitrary as to which event is designated as the cause and which as the effect. This, however, is not so; for only one of the two related events will have a prior cause (a proximate cause2or3) which is independent of the other event. Thus the falling of the ball is said to be the cause since there is a prior cause of it which makes no reference to the</page><page sequence="4">212 RICHARD M. GALE indenting of the bag, e.g., someone's releasing the ball or the ball being knocked off a shelf, etc.; but there is no prior cause for the indenting of the bag which makes no reference to the ball's falling on it. We are concerned not only with the cause of the changing in shape of the sand bag and the block of clay but also with the prox imate cause of the final or completed shape of the bag or clay. When we ask for the proximate cause of the final indentation of the bag (as opposed to the indenting of the bag) we want to know what event immediately preceded this state of affairs. We dis tinguish between a physical object or system changing because of some outside intervention and this object or system enduring in some manner, e.g., having some enduring property or changing in some uniform manner. The being fully indented is an enduring state of the bag, which commences at the instant at which the out side intervention?the falling of the lead ball?ceases to operate on it. The falling of the lead ball is the proximate cause2 of the fully indented state of the bag since it ends just when its effect begins. In Aristotelian terminology, we might say that the efficient cause consisting of the movement of the sculptor's hands ceases at the instant at which the form is embodied in the clay. Thus the movement of the sculptor's hands is the proximate causei of the changing in shape of the clay and the proximate cause2 of the com pleted shape of the clay. Often when we inquire into the proximate cause, or, simply, the cause, of a puzzling or unusual event or state of affairs, we do not want to know either what happens simultaneously with this event or what is temporally contiguous with it, but rather what initiates some process which in the normal course of things term inates in this event. Here the proximate or immediate cause is temporally separated from its effect by the process that it initiates and which terminates in the beginning of the effect. The action of a man who poisons someone is the proximate cause3 of his death, since this action initiates a process which ceteris paribus will ter minate in the person's death. This requires that there not occur during the time in which this process goes on any abnormal event or voluntary intervention of a third party which, in the context under consideration, would be said to be the proximate cause of</page><page sequence="5">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 213 the person's death. For example, if A pushes B out of the 100th floor window of the Empire State Building A initiates a process which in the normal course of things will terminate in B's death. But if C should shoot B dead (killing him instantaneously) as he passes the 50th floor window A's action is superseded as the cause of B 's death because there has been a voluntary intervention of a third person which makes the situation non-standard. In law, C's subsequent action is said to negative ,4's action as being the immediate cause of C's death; A can be tried only for attempted murder.8 A remote cause of an event is a cause which, like a proximate cause3, is temporally separated from its effect, but which, unlike a proximate causes, is the proximate cause of some sequence of causally related events one of which is, in the context under con sideration, said to be the proximate cause (in one of the three senses given above) of the effect. While a proximate cause3 initiates some process, or sequence of events, it is not the case that some phase of this process, or some member of this sequence of events, is, in the context under consideration, said to be a prox imate cause of the effect. It is important to put in the phrase "the context under consideration" to emphasize that we must not shift contexts, because then it could be the case that in the initial context some event is the proximate cause3 of an event X but that in some new context there is some event subsequent to this cause which is the proximate cause of X. For example, in a legal context A's shooting B might be said to be the proximate cause3 of ?'s death, but in a medical context the proximate cause would be said to be the deprivation of his blood cells of oxygen, which occurs subse quently to his being shot. It is a gross oversimplification to speak of causality as a rela tion between two events, since this omits reference to the situation or state of affairs which must obtain if this causal connection is to hold. While common-sense causal generalizations do not specify in any detail what this situation is we are nonetheless able to rec 8 This example appears in H. L. A. Hart and A. M. Honor?, Causation in the Law (Oxford, 1959), p. 190. I am deeply indebted to this excellent book throughout my paper.</page><page sequence="6">214 RICHARD M. GALE ognize when the situation is non-standard, and therefore the causal generalization does not apply. In a non-standard situation some necessary condition for the occurrence of the effect is absent or some condition sufficient for preventing the effect is present. Mill claimed that the set of all necessary conditions constituted the sufficient cause of an event, but this fails to take account of the common-sense distinction between a cause and a mere necessary condition. This distinction is based on the fact that a cause, as distinguished from a necessary condition, is usually either an inten tional action and/or an abnormal occurrence in relation to the sub ject-matter under inquiry. Oxygen is a condition but not a cause of a combustion, since oxygen is usually present; but if the usual state of affairs is one in which oxygen is absent, as in a vacuum tube, then the presence of oxygen in this tube could be said to be the cause of a combustion in this tube. In the course of this paper, when it is said that one event is a sufficient cause of another this will presuppose that there is a standard situation in which these two events occur, though we cannot specify in detail every neces sary condition which makes up this situation. The distinction between a cause and a mere condition explains why it is that we never speak of a remote cause as being sufficient. A remote cause is a proximate cause of some sequence of causally related events, the final one of which is the proximate cause of the effect. If we were to try and specify the standard situation in which a remote cause is sufficient, reference would have to be made to this sequence of causally related events, along with the situations in which each of them is a sufficient proximate cause of the event following it. Not only would our specification of this situation be fantastically complicated and extend over a long period of time, but more important, it would have to include reference to either an unusual event(s) or an intentional action(s), viz., the final one in the sequence of causally related events. But by including an ab normal event or an intentional action as a condition that comprises a part of the standard situation we are violating our distinction be tween a cause and a condition. The situation or state of affairs in which one event is a suffi cient proximate cause of another will cover the period of time from the beginning of the cause to the end of the effect. The reason for</page><page sequence="7">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 215 this is that the presence or absence of some condition during this time could prevent the effect from occurring. This consideration helps to answer the Russell-Taylor paradox concerning the seeming impossibility of a cause ever being earlier than its effect.4 For all they show is that the situation must extend to the end of the effect, not that the cause cannot precede its effect. The burning of logs in a fire place is the proximate causei of the simultaneous warming of the room only if certain conditions obtain during the occurrence of these two events, such as the room being sufficiently well in sulated, no refrigerator being left open in the room, etc. The fall ing of a lead ball on a sand bag is the proximate cause2 of the fully indented state of the bag only if certain things obtain both while the cause occurs (e.g., the ball is not so heavy that it will break the bag) and while the effect occurs (e.g., there is no counter acting force, such as someone ramming his fist upward into the bag at the instant the ball ceases to fall. Similar considerations apply to cases of proximate causations, the only difference being that the cause is temporally separated from its effect. II. Necessary Conditions for a Counter-Stipulation-Example Having said something about the distinction between a prox imate and remote cause and between a cause and a condition, we are now able to specify certain necessary conditions that must be fulfilled by any successful counter-stipulation-example to the analytic truth that a cause cannot be later than its effect. In say ing that these conditions are necessary it does not follow that satisfaction of them is sufficient for a successful counter-stipulation example; in fact, it will be argued in section III that any alleged counter-stipulation-example which fulfills these necessary condi tions will fail because it will cause absurdities to break out in neigh boring concepts. The conditions which must be satisfied by any successful counter-stipulation-example of a present event L being a sufficient cause of a past event E are: 4 B. Russell, "On the Notion of Cause," Mysticism and Logic (London, 1950); and R. Taylor's two articles, "Causation," Monist, 47 (1963), and "Can a Cause Precede Its Effect?" Monist, 48 (1964).</page><page sequence="8">216 RICHARD M. GALE (1) The ordinary use of "past" and "future" must not be radically altered. (2) It must be the case that every occurrence of an event of type L in a situation of type S has been preceded by an event of type E. (3) L must be either an intentional action or something that could be brought about by an intentional action. (4) E must not be a proximate or remote cause of L. (5) There must be no proximate cause of E that is earlier than L. The meaning of, and necessity for, some of these conditions may not be readily apparent. Therefore, it is essential that each of these conditions be separately explained at some length, and its necessity justified. (1) The necessity for this condition is that without it a counter-stipulation-example might fail through equivocation. When a person claims that some example justifies our saying that a present event causes a past event he must continue to use the words "past" and "future" in their familiar sense. The ordinary use of these words is based on certain logical and empirical criteria for distinguishing an asymmetry between the past and the future; an example of the former being that it is logically possible to remember the past and to anticipate the future, and an example of the latter being that our birth is in the past and our death is in the future. Any successful counter-stipulation-example requires a background of normal causal sequences (e.g., in which a scar is later than the slashing, etc.) in which causes are not later than their effects, and in which it is the past that is remembered and the future that is anticipated. If we should decide to say that our birth is in the future and our death in the past, etc., and that we remember the future and anticipate the past, then we will have accomplished the trivial feat of merely interchanging the use of "past" and "future" in our language. This will require us to recast certain analytic truths, so that it is now analytic that a cause cannot be earlier than its effect. But then we would have to devise a new counter-stipulation-example to our old analytic truth which would consist in a present cause producing a future effect. Back ward causality must necessarily be the exception. One might ob ject here that one of our logical criteria for distinguishing between the past and the future is that a present event can have future but not past effects, and to give this up is ipso facto to change our use</page><page sequence="9">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 217 of "past" and "future." To meet this objection let us say that we must continue to use in our counter-stipulation-example a majority of both our logical and empirical criteria for distinguishing be tween the past and the future. (2) The necessity for this condition is obvious. Part of the meaning of the claim that a concrete event L in a situation S causes another concrete event E is a generalization to the effect that if there is an occurrence of an event of type L in a situation of type S it will be accompanied by an event of type E. Thus data to the effect that numerous occurrences of events of type L in situations of type S are without exception accompanied by events of type E constitute evidence for the claim that a concrete event L in S caused a concrete event E. That a causal claim about two specific events entails a generalization about a class of events and a situation is perfectly consistent with the belief that there can be a causal con nection between two unique events in a certain situation, that is, events that occur only once in the history of the universe.5 But the data required by condition (2) are neutral as to whether L is a sufficient cause of E or whether E is a necessary cause of L. In fact, it does not even establish that there is a causal connection between E and L : their conjunction on numerous occa sions could be due to chance. This shows that causality cannot be analyzed solely in terms of logical sufficiency and/or necessity. To be a cause of is something more than to be a sign of. For this reason causal statements cannot be looked upon as Rylean inference tickets or as statements of functional correlation. (3) What must be added to the notion of logical sufficiency and /or necessity in order to give us a cause is that of effectiveness: a cause is that which can be used for the purpose of making, or bringing it about that, something else happens. The ordinary concept of causality is anthropomorphic. Its paradigmatic cases are ones in which an agent intentionally performs some action for the purpose of making something happen, e.g., tearing or bending a piece of metal. The use of tools is an extension of these para digmatic causes, since a tool is an extension of an agent's limb. 5 For a more detailed discussion of this point see my article, "Professor Ducasse on Determinism," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, XXII (1961).</page><page sequence="10">218 RICHARD M. GALE When a cause is neither an intentional action nor the result of an intentional action there is still present the notion that it could be used by an agent for the purpose of making its effect happen. This "could" may be counter-factual, involving that agents possess powers and abilities that they do not in fact possess. Condition (3) fulfils this requirement of efficacy, since it states that the cause must be an intentional action or something that could be brought about by an intentional action. Because of the deeply entrenched nature of the analytic truth that a cause cannot be later than its effect, we shall require the strongest counter-stipulation-example possible, namely one involving the paradigmatic sense of "cause." Therefore, our counter-stipulation-example will involve a case where L is itself an intentional action, and not just an event which couZd be brought about by an intentional action. It is very difficult to find a case of a present event making something happen in the past because the concept of making in volves that the process of making be temporally prior to its result, whether the result be a product or a state of affairs (or event). Just as a particular boat cannot be temporally prior to the process of making it, the state of exhaustion cannot be temporally prior to the process, such as running, that makes a person exhausted. Making some thing or making something happen involves the active control of some material or mechanism. Since ordinary verbs of making have built into them the posteriority of their results, we cannot say that we make something to have happened. However, there is available to us a weaker expression, "bringing it about," which does nof require the active control of some material or medium by an agent. Given a suitable counter-stipulation-ex ample, we might be justified in saying that someone brings it about that something has happened, even though he has not manipulated any levers, pulled any wires, or chiseled any marble. Even with this weaker sense of causing something to happen we run into diffi culty, since most ordinary action verbs, which involve bringing something about, require the posteriority of their effect. To find a counter-stipulation-example of an agent intentionally performing some action to bring it about that something has happened we shall have to either invent some new action verb or look to magic or paranormal phenomena. No doubt, it is for this reason that</page><page sequence="11">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 219 most of the counter-stipulation-examples that have been offered have been drawn from the latter domain. We shall allow our alleged counter-stipulation-example to envisage any sort of bizarre counter-factual association of events and to invoke as many co incidental occurrences as required. While there is complete free dom to supply content to causal generalizations or laws, there must not be too radical a departure from the form of causal generaliza tions or laws: that is, a successful counter-stipulation-example must retain most of the features of our present conception of a causal law or explanation. There are two important consequences of condition (3). First, since L is.an intentional action we can ask for its cause, which may consist in certain psychological factors, such as the agent's desires, motives, etc. And there will be prior causes for the cause of L, and so on. A successful counter-stipulation-ex ample should not have to deny the principle of determinism, for if such a denial was required it would indicate a radical departure from the ordinary concept of causation. Therefore, there must be no restriction placed upon how far back we can go in tracing the causal ancestors of L. Our account of L's causal ancestry can go back to E itself, and can even extend to times earlier than E. This point will figure prominently in our discussion of condition (5). A second consequence of condition (3) is that on any occasion on which an agent intentionally does (or does not do) L he cannot know prior to E that E occurs (or does not occur) independently of his intention to do (or not to do) L. This is not obvious and requires some explanation. L is an intentional action, which means that an agent could deliberate about doing it prior to his doing it. This period of deliberation is terminated by the forma tion of his intention to do (or not to do) L: the making of this decision may be prior to or simultaneous with the beginning of L (or not-L). While the agent is deliberating he has not yet made up his mind to do L, from which it follows that he then knows neither that L will occur nor that E will occur, since L is a sufficient cause of E.6 It would be absurd for him to say, "I am deliberating 6 Cf. my paper on "Endorsing Predictions," Philosophical Review, LXX (1961), where this point is developed and applied to the problem of future contingencies.</page><page sequence="12">220 RICHARD M. GALE about whether or not to do L, but I knowT that I shall do L." This describes what is at best a mock deliberation. Only when he terminates his deliberation by deciding to do L can he know that L, and thereby E, will occur. The general principle that an agent cannot know what he is going to do prior to his deciding to do it holds also for cases in which his intentional action is not preceded by the formation of an intention to do it. In such a case his inten tional knowledge of L, and thereby E, commences with his doing L; for while he is doing L he can claim to know in a non-infer ential manner what he is doing. The intentional knowledge the agent has of the occurrence of L and E based on his intention to do L is quite different from inductive knowledge that L and E will occur; for in deliberating about whether or not to do L he is not concerned with inductive evidence indicating whether or not L will happen. It is true that an agent who has intentional knowledge of L will have some inductive knowledge, such as that it is physically possible for him to do L. But this inductive knowledge hardly supports the claim that L will occur. Trying to make up one's mind about what to do is not trying to predict on the basis of inductive evidence what one will do, for one is concerned with one's own reasons rather than causes for one's doing one thing rather than another. "What should I do?" is not a request for an inductive prediction of what I shall do. When we have inductive knowledge of what will happen we cannot have an intention to make this happen or prevent it: it is absurd to say, "I know that this plane will crash, but I intend to make it crash (or not crash)." It may be that more than one person can intentionally do L for the purpose of bringing E about. On an occasion where one of these persons does not intentionally do (or not do) L he could have inductive knowledge of L and E, but such knowledge would not be possible on any occasion where he inten tionally does (or does not do) L. This consequence of (3) will be important when we try to show the absurdities that break out in neighboring concepts when we take a cause to be later than its effect. It might be argued that in regard to any alleged counter-stip ulation-example it can be shown that there is an incompatibility between condition (3) and (2), requiring that L never occur in S</page><page sequence="13">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 221 without being preceded by E. The argument is based on the introduction of experimental control in which the agent who has the ability to do L waits for some occasion on which E does not occur and then tries to do L. If he is successful, condition (2) is violated, since there is an occurrence of L in S which is not pre ceded by E; and if he is unsuccessful after numerous attempts it shows, in violation of condition (3), that L is not an intentional action, that is, one that can be done at will. This argument is easily countered, for from the fact that on numerous occasions on which E did not occur the agent was unsuccessful in his effort to do L it does not follow that L is not an intentional action. On each occasion on which he tried and failed to do L there might have been lacking some necessary condition for his doing L, the absence of which was not a result of the non-occurrence of E. This may require us to introduce a number of unlikely coincidences to account for the agent's failure to do L on those occasions, but, as pointed out above, we allow our counter-stipulation-example to invoke as many coincidental occurrences as it requires. For ex ample, E might consist in Jones dreaming that Smith will play Petrouchka on the piano the following day (call this event L). Smith is able to play the piano and also knows Petrouchka by heart. Smith waits for some occasion on which E does not occur and then attempts to do L on the following day. On one occasion his piano is stolen and on another thieves enter his home and tie him up just as he is about to strike the keyboard, etc., and none of these coincidences is caused by the non-occurrence of E. But from the fact that Smith did not do L on these occasions it does not follow that he did not have the ability to do L on these occasions, for ex hypothesis he is able to play Petrouchka at will. (4) This condition is necessary because it is an analytic truth that causality is asymmetric. Therefore, if E is a cause of L, L can not be a cause of E. To give up this analytic truth along with the analytic truth concerning the non-posteriority of a cause would depart too far from our ordinary concept of causality to count as a recognizable analog. An example of an alleged counter-stip ulation-example that violates this condition would be one in which an agent makes L happen because of his knowledge that E oc curred. E might be a mentalist predicting that a man will ride</page><page sequence="14">222 RICHARD M. GALE into the nightclub on top of an elephant in five minutes. His stooge, who is planted outside the club on top of an elephant, hears E on a walkie-talkie radio, and five minutes later rides triumphant ly into the club whistling the march from Aida (call this event L). Plainly E is a remote cause of L since the stooge does L because he has previously heard E. If we should persist in calling L the cause of E it would entail that E is God. The reason for this is that E is a cause of L and L in turn is a cause of E, in which case E is a cause of itself and therefore is God. One might quibble here that E still is not God since E is only a remote cause of itself. It might be argued that even when collusion is absent, and therefore L is not caused by E, it can be shown that there is an incompatibility between condition (2) and (4). The argument is basically the same as the one presented in our discussion of con dition (3), which is based on exercising experimental control over L so as to make it happen in the absence of E, thus refuting the claim that L is a sufficient cause of E.7 Whereas the above argument claimed that repeated failures to do L in the absence of E showed that L is not an intentional action, this new form of the argument claims that it entails, contrary to (4), that E is a cause of L. The first premiss of this argument is that the data required by condition (2) are neutral as to whether L is a sufficient cause of E or whether E is a necessary cause of L. If E is a necessary cause of L then not-E is a sufficient cause of not-L. Therefore, if on occasions when E does not occur we are unable to make L occur, thus satisfying condition (2), it shows that not-E is the sufficient cause of not-L. And this violates condition (4) since it entails that E is a necessary cause of L. The conclusion of this argument is a non-sequitur, for it is hardly not-E that is the sufficient cause of not-L. In fact it was not-E that was the cause of our trying to do L, and usually our effort to do something which we have the capacity to do is a 7 It might be argued that the introduction of experimental control of L violates condition (4), which requires that E not be a proximate or remote cause of L. This is not so, for if we were successful in making L happen when it is not preceded by E it would show only that not-E is on that occasion a remote cause of L (since it is our knowledge of not-E that causes us to bring L about), not that E is a cause of L.</page><page sequence="15">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 223 positive, rather than a negative, causal factor in its happening. On each occasion when we fail to do L in the absence of E there could be a causal explanation, coincidental though it may be, for not-L which is independent of not-E. (5) Why is it necessary that there be no proximate cause of E which is earlier than L? The reason is that if there were a prox imate cause of E which is earlier than L then there would be no causal determining of E left over for L in S to perform. In other words, if we already have a complete causal explanation of E in terms of an event(s) earlier than or simultaneous with E there is no need to invoke some later event L to causally account for E. A rather ingenious argument might be advanced to show that condition (5) can never be satisfied. In our discussion of condi tion (3) it was pointed out that since L is an intentional action it will have some prior cause, and, granted determinism, there can be no limit placed upon how far back we can trace the causal ancestry of this cause of L. But this entails that we can always find some causal ancestor of L that is either simultaneous with or contiguous with E. But then there is a proximate cause of E which is earlier than L. The following diagram, using t to represent an interval (rather than an instant) of time and "?&gt;" to represent "is a prox imate cause of," illustrates this: It is argued that in this diagram K2 qualifies as a proximate causei of E and K3 qualifies as a proximate cause2 of E, thereby failing to satisfy condition (5). The reason for this is based on the definition which we gave of a "proximate cause" in section I. A "proximate causei" is a cause (in some undefined sense) which is simultaneous with its effect, and a "proximate cause2" is a cause (in some undefined sense) which is temporally contiguous with its effect. Since K2 is a cause of E and is simultaneous with E it is, by definition, a proximate causei of E; and since K3 is a cause of E</page><page sequence="16">224 RICHARD M. GALE and is temporally contiguous with E it is, by definition, a proximate cause2 of E. It would be inconsistent with our definition of "re mote cause" to say that K2, as well as K3, is a remote cause of E, for a "remote cause" was defined as being both temporally separated from its effect and the proximate cause of some sequence of causally related events one of which is the proximate cause of the effect. While K2 and K3 satisfy the second conjunct of this definition they fail to satisfy the first conjunct, requiring that a remote cause be temporally separated from its effect. One cannot counter this argument by changing the definition of "proximate cause" so as to rule out the possibility of a proximate cause of an event being the proximate cause of some sequence of causally related events, one of which is the proximate cause of this event. For this gives us a circular definition; e.g., a "proximate causei" is a cause which is simultaneous with its effect and is not the proximate cause of some sequence of causally related events, one of which is the proximate cause of this effect. There is a way of meeting this argument. Let us assume that the concrete event K2 occurred in a situation G. If the concrete event K2 in C is a sufficient proximate cause of E this entails, not that there are repetitions of K2-type events in C-type situations accompanied by E-type events (there can be a causal connection be tween unique events), but that whenever (if ever) events of type K2 occur in situations of type C they are accompanied by events of type E. All our counter-stipulation-example has to do in order to rule out the concrete event K2 in G as a sufficient proximate cause of E is to stipulate that there is at least one occurrence of an event of type K2 in a situation of type C that is not accompanied by an event of type E.8 And similar considerations hold mutatis mutan dis for Ks. To rule out in this manner any causal ancestor of L as being a proximate cause of E will require our counter-stipulation example to make many stipulations concerning the way in which 8 One might argue that since K2 is a sufficient proximate cause of K^ and Kj a sufficient proximate cause of K, and K a sufficient proximate cause of L, therefore K2 is a sufficient cause of L. And, if this is so, there could not be an instance in which an event of type K2 occurs without being fol lowed by an event of type L. And, since L is a sufficient proximate cause of E, it entails that E must occur every time K2 occurs, in violation of the</page><page sequence="17">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 225 events occur; but we have agreed to allow complete freedom in the number and type of stipulations which are made concerning the de facto connections between events. Since there is no proximate cause of E earlier than L, it follows that any remote cause of E which is earlier than L, such as K4 in the above diagram, cannot be a proximate or remote cause of any event earlier than L which is the proximate cause of E. Rather, K4 can be a remote cause of E only because it is a remote cause of L. And note that K4 is not a remote cause in virtue of its being a remote cause of E since, in accordance with condition (4), E cannot be a remote or proximate cause of L. K4 must be the proximate cause of some sequence of causally related events which does not include E and one of which (in this case K) is the proximate cause of L. Having done something to explain and justify condition (5), it can now be shown why most of the counter-stipulation-examples that have been offered, and, in particular, all of those offered by Dummett in his two articles, have failed to satisfy this condi tion. Dummett, in his article on "Bringing About the Past," gives an example of a tribe which has an initiation rite in which their young warriors go off on a six day trip to prove their bravery. The young men are accompanied by elders of the tribe who act as wit nesses. They spend the first two days journeying to the hunting area, on the third and fourth days the young warriors fight with wild animals and prove themselves brave or cowardly, and they travel homeward on the fifth and sixth days. The chief of the tribe dances during the entire six day period to cause them to be brave. Now the brave conduct of the young men on the third and fourth days is the sort of event for which there are prior causes which together are a sufficient cause of this event, e.g., eugenics, educa tion, wild animal combat training, promises of rewards and pun stipulation. This argument fails because it requires us to speak of a remote cause of L, namely K2, as a sufficient cause of L. As pointed out in sec tion I, we cannot speak of a remote cause as sufficient because the concept of a situation in which it is sufficient has no application to a remote cause. K2 is sufficient for Kx in a situation C. And Kr is sufficient for K in a situation D. But then it is possible for K2 to occur in C and sufficiently cause K.! ; but the situation in which Kx occurs is not situation D, and there fore it is not sufficient for K.</page><page sequence="18">226 RICHARD M. GALE ishments, etc. Dummett is conveniently silent as to how these young men are reared: a tribe would be most amiss if it relied solely on the chief's six day dance marathon to bring about the men's bravery and paid no attention to the way in which these men were reared. On any occasion where the men's brave conduct can be satisfactorily accounted for by prior causes there would be no need to invoke the chief's dancing on the fifth and sixth days as the cause. A similar objection can be made to another one of Dummett's examples in which: A man is observed regularly to wake up three minutes before his alarm clock goes off. He often does not know when he goes to sleep whether or not the alarm has been wound, nor for what time it has been set. Whenever the alarm has been set and wound, but fails to go off be cause of some mechanical accident, which is later discovered, he always sleeps till very late.9 Now a person's waking up is the sort of event for which there are known prior causes, e.g., being shaken violently. Dummett admits as much when he says that on occasions when the alarm fails to go off the man over-sleeps. But he nevertheless wakes up without the alarm going off three minutes later : he is not doomed to a possibly endless sleep which can be ended only by the arrival of a princely alarm-clock that is about to go off in three minutes. On any occasion where there is a prior sufficient cause for the man waking up we would not invoke the subsequent ringing of the alarm-clock as the cause. The objections which have been raised to Dummett's two ex amples could be met by stipulating that there are no proximate sufficient causes for the brave conduct of the men and the waking of the man which are earlier than, respectively, the chief's dancing on the fifth and sixth days and the alarm-clock ringing. This stip ulation is in accordance with condition (5), which requires that there must be no proximate cause of E which is earlier than L. But condition (5) is ambiguous, admitting of a strong and a weak interpretation. The weak version, to be referred to as "(W5)," "Can an Effect Precede Its Cause?," op. cit., p. 32.</page><page sequence="19">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 227 states : On every occasion in which an event of type L occurs in a situation of type S there must be no proximate cause of E which is earlier than L. The strong version, to be referred to as "(S5)," states : On every occasion in which an event of type E occurs there must be no proximate cause of it which is earlier than the sub sequent occurrence of an event of type L in a situation of type S. The difference between these two different versions of condition (5) is that ( W5) permits an occurrence of an event of type E for which there is a proximate cause which is earlier than or simultaneous with E, provided only that an event of type L does not subsequently occur in a situation of type S on that occasion; whereas, (S5) rules out this possibility, since it requires that no occurrence of an event of type E can ever have a proximate cause earlier than the sub sequent occurrence of an event of type L in S. It shall now be shown that (W5) involves a departure from the ordinary concept of a causal explanation and law, and it shall then be shown that (S5) is subject to the same difficulty, only not in as obvious a manner as (W5). In section I it was pointed out that the situation in which a cause C is sufficient for its effect E will cover the period of time from the beginning of the cause to the end of the effect. The reason for this is that the presence or absence of some factor during this period of time could negative C as the cause of E, either by preventing E from happening or by superseding G as the cause of E (e.g., our earlier example in which the shooting of a man as he falls past the 50th floor window supersedes his being pushed out of the 100th floor window as the cause of his death). The de scription of the situation in which one event is a sufficient prox imate cause of another must not refer to what does or does not obtain at any time earlier than the beginning of the cause or later than the end of the effect. Obviously the temporal relation be tween a situation and two causally related events will be different when the cause is later than its effect, but we can derive the formula for the description of this situation by interchanging "earlier" with "later" and "beginning" with "end" in the preceding formula for the description of a situation in which a cause is not later than its effect. The description of the situation in which one event is a sufficient proximate cause of another (earlier event)</page><page sequence="20">228 RICHARD M. GALE must not refer to what does or does not obtain at any time later than the end of the cause or earlier than the beginning of the effect. (W5) violates this formula because it requires that our description of the situation in which L is a sufficient proximate cause of the earlier E make reference to what does not obtain earlier than the beginning of the effect E, namely, that there is no prox imate cause of E which is earlier than E. If there is an earlier proximate cause of E, it negatives L as the cause of E by superseding L. Thus, the ringing of the alarm-clock is the sufficient proximate cause of the man's waking up three minutes earlier only if this earlier event is not preceded by his being shaken violently, etc. This is analogous to describing the situation of a normal prior proximate cause by reference to what does not occur later than the end of the effect: shaking a man violently is the cause of his waking up only if in the situation there is not a ringing of his alarm-clock three minutes after he wakes up. It might be thought that this difficulty can be avoided by replacing (W5) by (S5). Since (S5) stipulates that there must be no proximate cause of an event of type E other than L, and thus none which is earlier than E, we need not describe the situation in which L is a cause of E by reference to the non-occurrence of cer tain possible proximate causes of E prior to E. If (S5) is satisfied then there is as a matter of fact no proximate cause of E earlier than E, and, therefore, there is no event earlier than E whose occurrence must be ruled out in the description of the situation in which L is causally sufficient for E. This superiority of (S5) over (W5) is, however, illusory. The question is not whether there is in fact any earlier proximate cause of E but what we would say if (as is logically possible) there were one. To understand the meaning of an expression we must elicit its rules of use, which permit us to use the expression on certain sorts of occasions and in certain sentential contexts, but not in others. The rules of use specify a set of permissible as well as prohibited moves. In eliciting the meaning that the word "cause" has in a counter-stipulation-example which satisfies (S5) we must discover its rules of use, and we discover this not only by noting on what sort of occasions it is used but also by seeing on what sort of occasions it would not be used. Thus, the question "Would you</page><page sequence="21">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 229 call the concrete event L the cause of E if on that occasion there were a prior proximate cause of E?" is relevant to determining the meaning that "cause" has in a counter-stipulation-example satis fying (S5). That such a state of affairs does not in fact occur, which is what (S5) stipulates, is irrelevant to how the word "cause" is being used. The fact that (S5) requires us to answer that L is the cause of E only if on that occasion there is no prox imate cause of E which is earlier than E shows that "cause" is being used in the same way as it is in an example that satisfies (W5). And therefore the same difficulties which apply to the use of "cause" in a counter-stipulation-example satisfying (W5) hold for one satisfying (S5). In both cases we are working with a different sense of "cause" than the ordinary one because we must describe the situation in which a cause is sufficient to its effect in a rather odd way. A defender of a counter-stipulation-example satisfying condi tion (W5) or (S5) might try to minimize the extent to which his use of "cause" departs from its ordinary use. He might argue that the reason why we do not have to characterize the situation in which an event is causally sufficient for a non-earlier effect by reference to what does not happen later than the end of the effect is due only to the contingent fact that we do not yet have any causal laws involving backward causation. But if such laws were to be established then, if a given event could have both a prior and posterior cause, we would have to specify the situation in which some earlier event caused it by reference to the non-occurrence of its posterior cause on that occasion. The difficulty with this reply is that it begs the question, for it attempts to eliminate the diffi culty attendant upon a counter-stipulation-example by presuppos ing that we already have, or could have, backward causal connec tions, which is the very thing to be proven by a counter-stipulation example. I do not know how serious a difficulty this is for a counter-stipulation-example, for it is not clear whether the queer way in which the situation is described in a counter-stipulation example is so radical a departure from ordinary usage as to dis qualify L as being the cause of E. We shall not linger on this difficulty, for we now hope to show that there are far graver diffi</page><page sequence="22">230 RICHARD M. GALE culties connected with any counter-stipulation-example satisfying condition (l)-(5). III. Absurdities Resulting from a Counter-Stipulation-Example We shall now devise a counter-stipulation-example satisfying conditions (l)-(5) for the purpose of showing that it involves a radical departure from the ordinary concept of causality. It will be shown that such an example causes absurdities to break out in certain neighboring concepts with which the concept of causality has logical liaisons, such as action, intention, deliberation, reason, memory, responsibility, and punishment. These absurdities can be resolved only by radically altering these concepts. And since the meaning of "cause" depends upon its logical relationships with neighboring words in the language, the changes which we are forced to make in the meaning of the latter are ipso facto changes in the meaning of the former. Let us devise a counter-stipulation-example, which shall be called the Case of the Retro-Warning. On numerous occasions Jones learns that his friend Smith was in a dangerous situation at some earlier time. He learns of this in perfectly ordinary ways? records, testimony of observers, collation of disparate memo ries, etc.?but he does not know what the eventuation of this dangerous situation was or whether Smith was warned of the danger by anyone. On each of these occasions Jones utters a "retro-warning" (call this event L) ; e.g., "Smith, this is Jones talking to you from your future. There's a time-bomb in the desk drawer!" And on each of these occasions it is the case that Smith has had a para-normal auditory experience in which he hears the exact words that Jones subsequently utters said in Jones's voice (call this event E). The present event L causes the past event E because it is reasonable, so it is argued, to say that Jones does L in order to bring it about that E has happened. This example satisfies all of the five necessary conditions. (1) The use of "past" and "future" is not radically altered, for it still is the past that can be remembered, etc. (2) L never occurs without being preceded by E. (3) L is an intentional action, and this entails that on any occasion on which Jones intentionally does L (or not-L) he cannot know</page><page sequence="23">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 231 that E occurred (or did not occur) independently of his intention to do L (or not-L). (4) E is not a cause of L. (5) E is called "paranormal" because it has no prior proximate cause, and, in fact, no proximate cause prior to L, thus satisfying (S5). If one can perform an intentional action so as to cause, or bring about, a past event, as in the above example, then one can deliberate, plan, prepare, and decide in respect to some past occur rence. Therefore, in order to accommodate our giving up the ana lytic truth that a cause cannot be later than its effect we must change our concept of intention, deliberation, choice, etc., so that it is no longer an analytic truth that we can intend, deliberate and choose only in respect to the future. Since Jones can perform the intentional action L in order to bring about that E happened, on any occasion on which Jones intentionally does L (or not-L) it is logically impossible for him to know that E happened (or did not happen) independently of his intention to do L (or not-L). This logical truth was defended in our discussion of condition (3), in which it was shown that our concept of an intentional action is such that it is absurd to speak of an agent knowing independently of his intention that he is going to perform some intentional action or that some event of which his action is the sufficient cause (such as E) occurs. Since E is past it follows, in accordance with condi tion (1), that it is logically possible for Jones to have a trace, such as a memory, of the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of E, and therefore to know independently of his intention to do L that E did (or did not) occur. But this means that it is on some occasion both logically impossible and logically possible for Jones to know that E occurred (or did not occur) independently of his intention to do L (or not-L) on that occasion. That, as a matter of fact, Jones does not remember that E occurred (or did not occur) on any occasion on which he intentionally did L (or not-L), which is con tained in our stipulation that he knows only that Smith was in a dangerous situation but not whether he was re tro-warned, is ir relevant; for the preceding contradiction is due to a clash between two logical possibilities. Allowing memory and intention to work the same way pro duces another contradiction in addition to the above, i.e., that it is logically possible for Jones to know that E occurred and to know</page><page sequence="24">232 RICHARD M. GALE that E did not occur. Memory and intention are analogous in this one respect: each gives us a right to claim that we know that something occurs (or does not occur). It is logically possible that Jones remembers (or has some other sort of trace) that E did not occur: he was there when Smith was in the room with the time bomb in the desk drawer, and noted that he was not retro-warned. Subsequent to the tragic death of Smith, Jones begins to deliberate about the wisdom of retro-warning Smith about the bomb, and after considering good reasons for doing this decides to do it. Jones now knows on the basis of his intention to do L that E happened. Thus there is a contradiction between what he knows through memory and what he knows on the basis of his intention. This conflict between memory and intention cannot be dis solved without radically altering the logic of one of these terms. Memory and intention are disanalogous in the manner in which we argue for, and hold on to, memory and intention claims. We give up our intention to do something, and therefore our intentional knowledge claim, when good reasons are given for not doing the intended action, such as that this intended action would have un desirable consequences. A reason for performing (or not per forming) some intended act can never be that the intended act, or some event which is causally dependent upon it, does or does not happen. It is queer to say "A reason for you not to carry out your intention to go to the movies is that in fact you will not go to the movies" or "Jones, you ought not to retro-warn Smith because it is not the case that he was retro-warned." A relevant reason for Jones's deciding to retro-warn Smith is that Smith is not such a bad chap, etc. A memory claim, on the other hand, is never given up because good reasons are given to show that it is best for the remembered event not to have occurred. "It is best not to remember" does not entail that what is remembered did not occur; in fact, the contrary is the case. A memory claim is withdrawn only in the light of evidence to show that the "remembered" event did not occur. Because of this difference in the way in which we justify memory and intention claims, it is possible for Jones to intend to do L so as to bring E about even when he remembers that E did not occur; the reason being that facts about the occurrence or non-occurrence</page><page sequence="25">WHY A CAUSE CANNOT BE LATER THAN ITS EFFECT 233 of E cannot count as a reason for or against his doing L. And, similarly, it is possible for Jones to hold on to his memory claim even after he has decided to do L because no reason adduced for his doing L would be relevant for his withdrawing his memory claim : we never give up a memory claim because good reasons are given for the non-occurrence of what we claim to remember. This log ically possible conflict between Jones's memory and intention can be dissolved only by altering the logic of one of these terms so that, for example, a memory claim might be given up in the light of good reasons for the "remembered" event not to have occurred. This would be the paranoic concept of memory. At this point it will no doubt be argued that the conflict which has been shown to arise between memory and intention when we allow an intentional action to bring about a past effect would also arise between normal intentions to bring about future events and precognition, if we were to possess such a faculty. If this faculty of precognition is to be analogous to memory in any crucial re spects it must allow it to be logically possible for a person to pre cognize the decisions he will make as a result of future deliberations and the intentional actions done as a result of these decisions, just as it is logically possible for him to remember his past decisions and intentional actions. But then, it is logically possible for a person to both know that some event will happen and to know that it will not happen: e.g., he knows by precognition that he will do L in the future and he also knows that he will not do L on the basis of his present intention not to do L. It is then claimed that it is only a contingent fact that we do not possess such a faculty of precognition. To which the obvious reply is that since (i) our present conceptual system contains the concepts of deliberation, intention and action, and (ii) the concept of precognition is log ically incompatible with these concepts, it cannot be a contingent fact that our present conceptual system does not contain the con cept of precognition. To accommodate the concept of precognition we would be forced to jettison a significant part of our conceptual system, namely a cluster of concepts on which the concept of a per son depends, such as intention, etc. What is contingent is that we have a conceptual system containing this cluster of related con cepts, and if the world were radically different we would not have</page><page sequence="26">234 RICHARD M. GALE this conceptual system. If everyone had "precognitive" awareness of his entire future and was never able to act so as to falsify these "precognitions" we would not have the concept of deliberation, action, etc. We would not be persons performing intentional actions, but some sort of robot mechanically playing out his life in accordance with a script he did not write. The absurdities that result from allowing a cause to be later than its effect are not confined just to memory and intention but also appear in other concepts which are connected with the concept of causality, such as responsibility and punishment. Let us sup pose that E is an illegal act and there is a law against bringing E about, anyone who does so intentionally being subject to blame, shame, and punishment. On some occasion E happens, and, in accordance with the counter-stipulation-example, it has no prox imate cause other than Jones's subsequent action of doing L. Therefore, since an illegal act has occurred which is a result of Jones's intentional action L, we can hold him responsible for this and punish him accordingly. Thus, we are punishing him for some action that he has not yet performed. But part of the justification of punishment is to reform the character of the crim inal so that he will not perform illegal acts in the future. How ever, this justification cannot apply to our punishment of Jones, for if the punishment does succeed in reforming Jones so that he will not do L in the future, then we will have punished him for a crime that he does not commit.10 University of Pittsburgh. 10 This paper was written while the author was engaged in a research project entitled "The Logic of Time Language" under National Science Foundation grant # 387.</page></plain_text>
