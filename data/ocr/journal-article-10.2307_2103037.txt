<plain_text><page sequence="1">REALISM, DIALECTIC, AND THE TRANSCENDENT' Jaspers has said that the nineteenth century saw the birth and develop- ment of a new type of thinkers, the poet-thinkers, the thinker-poets. Niet- zsche and Kierkegaard reached and lived a new synthesis of two kinds of mental attitudes. However, it would be too much to say this. For Pascal, Lucretius, perhaps Dante, and probably Blake and Coleridge belong to the same type. Similarly, it would be too much also to say that what is called Philos- ophy of Existence was born in the nineteenth century. For there is Pascal; and even Spinoza took his start from a problem of existence; and to men- tion one who is considered as representing the very opposite of the philos- ophy of existence, what is the philosophy of Plato, if not the meditation of an "existent man," to use an expression of Kierkegfaard, on the life and death of another "existent man," Socrates? It is true nonetheless that from about the middle to the end of the nine- teenth century, all the frames of classical philosophizing were shattered. And we might even extend the observation and say that the frames of many other activities of the human mind were shattered also. It might be said that Courbet and Manet are the last of the great painters. Van Gogh and Cezanne touch us more by another quality mingled with their painting; and in them pictorial art begins a new adventure (although this too was pre- figured in the art of Rembrandt and El Greco). In the same manner, we may meditate on the Kierkegaard phenomenon. What philosopher before Kierkegaard had taken for his theme his most personal experience? In order to find analogous cases, it is not philosophers to whom we must turn, but to poets such as Nerval or Rimbaud. So the observation of Jaspers retains its value, notwithstanding our qualifications. Let us consider Nietzsche and Kierkegaard again. They are similar in that both are poet-thinkers, and also in that they have common foes: the professor of philosophy and the historian (not, of course, an historian like Thucydides, himself an existential thinker). Moreover, both oppose monism the Unique, the Superman, in a word the Individual (although there are many differences between the types of individual conceived by each). Both are foes of the ethical point of view, or at least "suspend" it. Both set something against philosophical reflection: the one, dogma and 1 I wish to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Alfred Schuetz and to Professor Arthur Goodman for their assistance in preparing the English rendition of these pages. Their help has been invaluable. 496</page><page sequence="2">REALISM, DIALECTIC AND TRANSCENDENT 497 creed; the other, the will to power. But these are not the most important thoughts they have in common. Both take their start from the death of God, interpreted, it is true, in quite a different and even opposite manner, by each. For the one, the death of God, of a God who reveals himself as a God by his own death, is our salvation; for the other, on the contrary, our salvation is in the death of God, of a God who ceases altogether by his death to be a God and even to be at all. And both seek real eternity in the instant, the instant of the Kierkegaardian repetition and resurrection, the instant of the eternal recurrence for Nietzsche. The instant of the one and of the other, which is perhaps the same instant at bottom, is a fusion of the three aspects and, as Heidegger says, the three ecstasies of temporality: the past, the future, and the present; and when Heidegger speaks of his Entschlossenheit, he offers only an interpretation, but up to a certain degree, a valid one of the Kierkegaardian as well as of the Nietz- schean conception. Nietzsche places us within an immanence that would crush us, even more than the old transcendence, if we let ourselves be crushed (and only the superman can resist the crushing). Kierkegaard confronts us with a transcendence that crushes us, but which at the same time is for us a balm and a consolation. Both take pleasure-perhaps something of a sadistic pleasure in placing man before an abyss; and it is when he is very near losing himself in anguish and terror, that man rises again and asserts him- self. Both revel in, and at the same time are tormented by, the same para- doxes: the death of God, the repetition or the eternal recurrence. One might even say that they are themselves paradoxes; and by the paradoxes which they have before their thought as objects and which they feel in themselves as subjects, the sense of their own individuality becomes keener and keener. Such is the starting-point of what we might call their existen- tial dialectic; each is a union of opposites, and to use the ancient words of Heracleitus, a discordant accord, tense because containing in itself contrary impulses. Hegel had admirably seen two processes of intellectual dialectic which he had combined: the march from opposite to opposite and the synthetic character of the third term. But the dialectic of Nietzsche and Kierke- gaard is an affective and pathetic rather than an intellectual dialectic. Theirs is lived and felt. It goes from thesis to antithesis, but the synthesis is unattainable, except in rapture and unconscious. The synthesis cannot be formulated in words; even the thesis and antithesis cannot. We are in the realm of immediacy, not in that of mediation. We are very far indeed from the Hegelian dialectic, with its solemn and</page><page sequence="3">498 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH regular march from thesis to antithesis and synthesis,' very far also from the Platonic dialectic with its movement upwards and downwards.3 Hence, we can approach a general conception of what a non-Hegelian dialectic might be. By an interplay of theses and antitheses that destroy one another, we constitute an existential dialectic that goes from perceptive immediacy to ecstatic immediacy. We might say that there is a positive ontology of perception4 and a negative ontology of the mystical event. For dialectic is the way, a way that is forever gone over again, forwards and backwards, and is constituted, to borrow an expression of Darnascius, by the rending of hypotheses and ideas. In this existential dialectic, we might hear brief bits of broken dialogue, between the moments where the dialogue proper ceases, and where silence, if we may so speak, makes itself heard. Silence of perception, in which the mind is nourished by things, silence of ecstasy where mind achieves a union with its own highest point, which is at the same time the highest point of the world. Between these two immediacies there is a tension and intensity by which existence is defined, a tension that endures between the transcendent im- manence of perception and the immanent transcendence of ecstasy. But these very words show that the moments where apparently the dia- logue ceases are nevertheless moments where it continues, or at least whence it may again arise; for when reflection is directed upon them, perception and ecstasy are-we might say-dialecticized.5 The Hegelian dialectic leads us toward the vision of a whole. But the dialectic which we have come to discern dimly, remains in partialities and particularities, in parcels and parts, in crumbs as Kierkegaard says, in the minute particulars of Blake, in the singular pulses of experience of Blood and James. One might speak here of a logic of pure quality (really, the pure illogic of quality) where the more is not more than the less, and which would not render our view of the world richer, but which would lead us toward a sort of nude and blind contact with the Other. 2 Although in its first formulations, it was very much more full of life and sponta- neous rhythm. I Although the dialectic of Plato seems much freer than that of Hegel, and stops before the One on the one hand, and before the many particulars on the other, and avoids the violent seizure or rather attempt at seizure, of reality, by the Hegelian dialectic. I Naturally, we do not here understand perception as classical psychology under- stands it, but much more as a Whitehead, or as a Heidegger and a Bergson describe it. 5 Hegel and Kierkegaard have emphasized, each in his own way, this paradoxical union of relation and non-relation, of immanence and transcendence.</page><page sequence="4">REALISM, DIALECTIC AND TRANSCENDENT 499 There will not be one ineffable, but ineffables in the plural, many ones, each at the same time unlimited and limited. Here the Absolute is con- ceived more as intensity than as totality. It is a felt Absolute, felt (let us recall Thomas Traherne) in a very little thing. The question remains, however, whether these multiple ineffables are not one-in a manner, ineffable itself. II In order to see now the link of dialectic with realism, let us for a moment ponder on some of the more important metaphysical ideas, such as Being or the Absolute. Being has an objective aspect: resistance and independ- ence; but also what we might call a subjective aspect: mutual participation and self-achievement. In the same manner, the Absolute may be con- ceived as the nameless One of Damascius, or as the Hegelian and Bradleyan Absolute that is the Whole. Through all these ideas we feel this ineffable that is more real than truth and from which discourse starts, and towards which it returns, and which perhaps is not the same at the end as at the beginning. We see that the more fundamental reason for dialectic is the existence of a transcending reality. Dialectic is explained by a reality that transcends it. But there is another relation between dialectic and realism than the one to which we have already alluded. There is in realism itself a dialectic that is explained likewise (as is every other form of dialectic) by a reality that transcends it. And we shall have to ask later whether it the very reality itself there is a not already a dialectic (as Hegel conceived it). Indeed, one could rarely see the dialectic at work in the sequence of systems in a clearer light than in the development of contemporary thought (although this dialectic progression is never absent and is as clear in the Pre-Socratic schools as it could ever be). Bradley and Royce denied the possibility of realism, and what happened? This realism, negated and destroyed beforehand, raised its head again, and affirmed itself more strongly than ever. And it appeared in two very different, even anti- thetical, forms: on the one hand an immanent realism, an epistemological monism with Perry, and the other neo-realists, and on the other hand, (and apparently, at least a little later) the dualism of the critical realists, Strong, Santayana, Drake, and Sellars. So we see realism passing from the position of James (in the article "Does consciousness exist?") or of Bergson (in the beginning of "Matter and Memory"), or of Russell and the neo-realists, who hold to the unity of the object and its image, to the other and opposite realism of those who sepa- rate object and image. In fact, nothing is more difficult (but this is in no manner an argument against the validity of this position) than to remain</page><page sequence="5">500 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH faithful to the monistic form of realism, and the human intellect travels over again this path of oppositions and fusions of the image and the object. And is there not equally a dialectical movement that goes from the Husserlian bracketing to the Heideggerian assertion that no bracketing is possible?6 Husserl tried to separate essence and existence. In vain. The thought to which he had given birth negates his own thought. Existence has no essence, says Heidegger; the idea of essence is man-made, artist- made, artificial in the proper sense of the word, since it is formed in the same way as the pattern of the artist or the craftsman. This anthropomorphism is one of the original sins of philosophy. So if there is a dialectic of realism, if there is even a dialectic of phenom- enology, and in general if there is a dialectic in the human mind at all, it is because dialectic is not the final explanation, and is only an explanation because it is itself explained by another term, namely, reality. Whence comes this interplay of antitheses, this gleaming of the facets of one oppo- site under the light of the other, if not from the need and striving of the mind? It tries to come nearer and nearer to the real. The real refuses a purely intellectual contact, and eludes it, and we are capable only of taking successive, alternating, contrary views of it. We meet again, and this time perhaps in a more objective manner, the idea that we have already formulated: the dialectic is the way. But the way must be explained by its from and by its towards. Dialectic will be fully dialectic only if it dialecticizes itself; that is, if dialectic, which puts everything else in its place, takes its own place also, vhich is between the two non-dialectical terms (if we may use this word). III Let us notice here, before we study this from and this towards, that there is another side to this evolution of contemporary thought. What we have seen is that with Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, human thought expressed its subjectivity in its keenest form.7 On the other hand, in philosophies such as those of Whitehead and Heidegger (however different they may be) the object, the thing is perceived in its fuller reality. Heidegger speaks of "being-in-the-world." Whitehead emphasizes the mode of causal efficacy. 6 In fact, one could find in Husserl many prefigurations of the Heideggerian conceptions: the idea of the Being in the world, the theory of the things in their corporeality, the emphasis on the natural, naive standpoint, on perception as starting-point and terminus of science, the role of the body! the affirmation of the non-intentionality of perception, and of the intentionality of feeling. 7 Though each emphasizes an object (an object-subject for Kierkegaard,since it is the incarnate God; an object purely object for Nietzsche, since it is the eternal recur- rence). And it is by its contact with these objects that subjectivity becomes, as we have said, keener and keener.</page><page sequence="6">REALISM, DIALECTIC AND TRANSCENDENT 501 Man, says Heidegger, is naturally, innately outside himself. He is always with other men, and nearby things, this with and this nearby being closely related to each other. And it is the fact that man is naturally outside himself that constitutes the transcendence defined by Heidegger, in his world where there is no longer the classical transcendence of God. This is not to say that Whitehead and Heidegger ignore that subjective thought the strength of which we have seen in Nietzsche and Kierkegaard (no more than Nietzsche and Kierkegaard ignore objectivity). Let us recall only the importance of the reading of the poets Wordsworth and Shelley for Whitehead, H6Aderlin and Rilke, for Heidegger, and we will feel their affinity with the poetic vision. But for us the important fact is that Heidegger and Kierkegaard confront us with facts, objects, real stubborn things. At the same time, Whitehead frees us from the classical conceptions of time and space. No other thinker, not even Eddington and De Broglie, whose reflections on this subject are so far-reaching, not even Bergson, has more clearly shown the necessity of shattering the spatio-temporal schemes of classical physics and of con- ceiving an intermingling of phenomena, so that "here" and "now" lose their meaning not merely verbally, as they seem to do in Hegel, but actu- ally. The world, as seen by modern science, is constituted by relations that are at the same time more massive and more subtle, more formless, Ynore vast, and more gradational than those which classical science used. And when we have to relate phenomena, the idea of causality is too gross and simple to satisfy us.8 Nothing is more characteristic of contemporary philosophy than this emphasis on the subjective in its utmost subjectivity and on the objective in its utmost objectivity (but let us add this qualification that the word objective is rather clumsy and that we should need some other to denote that density behind concepts, that opacity, that intermingling without any name, comparable to the mud that seemed to young Socrates-for quite other reasons-to elude any idea). These armed antitheses which appear at the extreme point of advance of contemporary thought, this great objectivism, and this great subjectivism (to take the expressions of Sheldon, who uses them, it is true, in reference to different conceptions) might be found equally well in other high activities of man, in other types of vision, like those of Van Gogh and C6zanne. Van Gogh represents the highest point of subjectivity, C6zanne-the thirst and hunger for objectivity at its utmost point, and the desire to "make the image." 8 Science, says Heidegger, knows today that it is environed by something it needs to start from, but which it cannot comprehend ni even understand. It feels its own limits, the Other that supports Science, but cannot be seized by it.</page><page sequence="7">502 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH But even then we cannot, any more than in philosophy, separate great objectivism and great subjectivism. For by a fatality as reasonable, Hegel would say, as every other fatality, we are attracted to C6zanne less by his objectivity than by his need for objectivity, which is a very subjective thing, indeed, and which appears the more subjective as we see it rather as an effort than as an achievement; and on the other hand, Van Gogh enjoys being absorbed in a red or a yellow, and becoming object, so to speak. So the subjective leads us to the objective, as the objective brought us to the subjective. Does this not indicate that we must at the same time push subjectivity and objectivity towards their utmost point, and yet know that they cannot be known apart from each other and even must be annihilated in this move- ment of thought that strives to approach nearer and nearer to things? This is only another manner of saying again that there is a deep relation between dialectic and realism. IV What we have said about great objectivity gives us some indication of the from, the starting-point of dialectic. There was a weakness in the classical types of empiricism and realism. They left to idealism the privilege and prestige of high and difficult thought. But, in fact, empiricism and realism also are susceptible of taking high metaphysical forms. When Kant said that being is that which is posited, he probably provided the starting-point for, the positive philosophy of Schelling and for what we might call the higher empiricism. There is a transcendental empiricism (the empiricism of Schelling) which seeks to show the conditions, let us not say of the possibility, but of the reality of experience. There is the radical empiricism of James which welcomes the relations as well as the terms. There is even the possibility of a realism of essences like that of Moore, Russell, Husserl, and Santayana. There is, as in the Bergsonian (and also in the Schelerian) philosophy an affective realism. Transcendental, radical, non-intellectual (for nearly all these empiricisms may be united in a single doctrine), this empiricism will be very different from that of the text-books. It will allow us to unite tend- encies of philosophers as different as Pascal, Schelling, and Hume, Scheler, Boutroux, and Russell, Bergson, Nietzsche, and Rauh, Whitehead and Heidegger. This empiricism will be related to a criticism of the idea of possibility, to an affirmation of the reality of the contingent, and of the contingency of the necessary. The primacy of the modality of reality that was ignored by some of the philosophers of existence but not by Kant, will be one of the</page><page sequence="8">REALISM, DIALECTIC AND TRANSCENDENT 503 tenets of this philosophy. Founded in part on inner observation, it will try to constitute existential theories of space and time where time will be felt as expectation and yearning, fear, regret, and remorse. On the other hand, it will say: time and space are only fictions; what exists are things before, things after, things at the same time. It is from things, in fact from the world-from things juxtaposed and postposited and anteposited that the ideas of time and space are derived. Naturally, an idealistic philosopher will say that we are guilty of a vicious circle. We know the accusation, but have not the feeling of guilt. The superiority of the pseudo- negative (imperfect) over the pseudopositive (perfect) will be another of the tenets of this doctrine.9 Such an eimpiricism will permit us to join a theory of contingency with a theory of reality. And it leads us to realism. There is no reflection except upon what is not-reflection, no consciousness but of the unconscious. Before I think, there is always something-that which I think. I think, therefore something is thought, is as true as I think, therefore I am, and that which is thought about did exist before it was thought. Moreover, the sense organs are not only formed by mind, but also molded by objects. Let us say with Plato that the eye is sunlike, and this em- piricism will agree with Plato's thought that light formed it. But, inter- preting Plato in quite a non-platonic way, we must add that matter forms the form, before form informs matter, and then we find something that is akin to the emergency of Alexander and to the concrescence of Whitehead. Novalis has spoken of a magical idealism. Following a tradition that comes through Albertus Magnus and the Arabs from Plato, even more than from Aristotle, he has deeply united magic and idealism. But it is not less legitimate to construct a magic realism, and Reid dimly knew it, when he spoke of the magic of perception. No doubt, these two terms, idealism and realism, are far from satisfac- tory; and we might say rather, as Novalis himself would have said, that extreme idealism and extreme realism coincide, or perhaps better, that we have to place ourselves beyond both realism and idealism, or better still, beneath them, and to live negating all "isms," which are only views-views on something that cannot be viewed. 9 Epistemology does not have to come first. It presupposes always a theory of reality. No doubt the theory of reality presupposes also epistemology. There is here a necessary circle. But the theory of reality seems to recognize more frankly its need of the theory of knowledge as its presupposition, than the theory of knowledge recognizes a theory of reality as its presupposition. In the second place, and Nicolai H1artmann and Heidegger have emphasized this idea, we might say that in the theory of reality man directs his eyes on things, while in the theory of knowledge, there is an oblique observation of reflections.</page><page sequence="9">504 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Our realism will not be a homogeneous realism where all is on one plane, for example, the plane of extension. But it will show us many concretes, by force of nature coalesced and concretized; that is what we call things. We go from the visual immediacy criticized by Whitehead towards some- thing deeper. May we not recall here the Dinggedicht of Rilke and the philosophy of Husserl defining things, as much as they can be defined, by the multiplicity of their aspects? For, says he, they are never given except in aspects and perspectives. They give and do not give themselves. Never before have things been better conceived in their variegated perspectives, as well as in their opacity and final invisibility. They are immanent and trans- cendent, or rather elude these qualifications. We have found ourselves already very near mysticism, first a mysticism of the thing, then perhaps a mysticism of the person. That is to say that we are no longer studying the from and the whence, but the towards and the whither of dialectic. Perception is beneath consciousness. What we are speaking of now, this kind of ecstasy, is beyond consciousness. And both perception and ecstasy are unity of subject and object. And dialectic is between the two. It always implies distance between subject and object, and this distance is consciousness. The idea of Bradley, the separation of the that and the what in judgment, may appear to us as one of the most convincing illustrations of the divisive power of consciousness. We might also recall the Unglhckliches Bewusstsein of Hegel and indeed many other passages in the writings of Schelling and Hegel. If truth is in judgment and implies consciousness, reality is in uncon- sciousness. If we try to study such metaphysical ideas as being, absolute, trans- cendence, space, we shall see that each leads us towards something that lies beyond, or rather beneath ideas. That is to say also that all relations must be merged in the super-rela- tional experience (the non-consciously experienced experience), and also that it is rather in feeling than in reason that we will find what for us is the closest approximation to the absolute; and finally that if we want to regain the paradise lost, we must lose ourselves in the paradise regained; this is even a condition for regaining it. We must lose ourselves in it in order not to lose it. And consciousness takes place between the loss and the regain- ing of paradise; it is essentially unhappy. In going from its starting-point to its terminus, consciousness passes by the negativity that guides the interplay of the antitheses, butbeyond this Hegelian negativity, a more essential negativity rises, really destroy- ing,'0 responding to the need of the "existent man" of annihilating his own 10 The idea of a negative ontology must not lead us to the belief in an objective nothing. As Bosanquet says, thought is always of a positive content.</page><page sequence="10">REALTSM, DIALECTIC AND TRANSCENDENT 505 thought in an attitude of submission to this dominating transcendence, not the transcendence of any dogma, or of any philosophical system either. There is in this transcending movement a self-accomplishment which is at the same time self-destruction, a failure that is triumph. We may repre- sent this idea mythically by uniting the stories of Phaeton and Empedocles. The one, like the other, fulfills his destiny by self-destruction. Let us add that the philosopher's act of self-destruction is accompanied by and even expressed in an act of self-construction. No doubt, what we might call the charm and the attraction of these ideas of the transcendent and the absolute derives, in part, from their ambiguity and the sparkling of their meanings. Transcendence appears as a terminus ad quem and more etymologically, as a "movement towards." The abso- lute is the separate and that which unites. We have only to think of one of the themes of Plato's Parmenides where the first hypothesis is the'sepa- rate absolute, and the second, the unifying absolute. This brings us back again to the idea of the ineffable, which can onlybe described in antitheses and paradoxes (as in another domain the English metaphysical poets perfectly knew). The absolute, the transcendent, are the extreme points of thought where it reaches its own limits. At that moment, a light glitters, of which we cannot say whether it comes from thought or from the Other, the Nameless Thing, something like the Dark Deity of D. H. Lawrence. Is it possible for us to return to immanence, without losing transcendence, and to preserve the value of those myths, after their destruction by thought? Is an eternal recurrence of dialectic possible, whereby the first term, en- riching and impoverishing itself, reappears again and again in its Firstness? Questions of this kind are philosophy itself, for philosophy is rather ques- tioning than answering. It is movement, dimly discerned rather than seen, from reality through dialectic and antitheses, towards ecstasy. JEAN WAHL. MT. HOLYOKE COLLEGE.
