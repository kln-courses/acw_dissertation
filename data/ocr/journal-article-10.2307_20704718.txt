<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY COLLECTION OF MAORI ARTEFACTS, MADE ON CAPTAIN COOK'S FIRST VOYAGE Wilfred Shawcross University of Auckland The following is an account of 36 items collected in New Zealand on Captain Cook's first voyage and now displayed in the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of the University of Cambridge. The material to be described is only the New Zealand part of a more com prehensive collection from Oceania, made on that voyage and presented to the Earl of Sandwich, who, in turn, gave it to Trinity College, Cam bridge, in 1771. The Earl was the first Lord of the Admiralty in Lord North's Ministry of 1770-1782 and cannot have been responsible for the original organisation of the voyage. It therefore seems possible that the gift of the collection to the Earl was initiated not through the Navy, but rather owing to his friendship with Joseph Banks.(1) The gift to Trinity College was a prompt one and is recorded in a contemporary catalogue, but apparently did not include the entire original collection, because at least two items, the long wooden horn 22.435 and the short horn 22.436 remained at the Earl's home, Hinchingbrooke, to be given to the College by a descendant. This collection was housed in the College library until it was transferred in 1914 to the recently established Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.(2) There were a further five items, also obtained on the first voyage, which had belonged successively to the Earl of Denbigh's collection and had been lent to the museum until dispersal in 1912, and had belonged previously to the Pennant collection, housed at Downing Hall, Flint. Thomas Pennant was also a friend of Joseph Banks, through whom he must have received these New Zealand specimens(3). Those pieces which found their way to the Cambridge Museum included a shell trumpet 25.375, a lure hook 25.382, a wooden club 25.373, a whalebone hand club 25.372 and some plumes 25.375. The provenance of this entire collection can thus be given with remark able authority and confidence and its bringing together, half a century 1. Beaglehole 1963 1:7. 2.

By any standards, this assemblage, localised to New Zealand between 1769 and 1770, stands as a document of the highest importance on prehistoric Maori material culture. THE PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE All items which could be traced to the collection were drawn in November 1968. Where possible the original drawings were made to natural scale, in order to avoid introducing distortion, leaving final reduction to block-making. Those items which were too large, the garments and staff weapons, were, however, reduced in drawing. Illus tration by line was chosen in preference to half-tone, not only because of the cost of reproduction, but also because the discipline of drawing helps to accentuate the observation and analysis of the objects. For example, before a decorative pattern may be drawn, some form of theory for its organisation must be devised. It seems therefore worth quoting Con stantinos Doxiadis, who has rationalised the preference for drawings as follows: In all cases presented I have used drawings and plans most of which were prepared for this purpose, rather than photographs. There are three reasons for this. A photograph presents a great number of phenomena and does not allow us to isolate easily the special aspect to be studied, while a drawing can stress the phenomena which must be emphasised and omit those which are not of interest to our study. In this way we can?by abstraction?present a specific pheno menon or a specific aspect of the [subject].(4) The catalogue of items has been organised into functional classes, where the function may reasonably be identified. Each piece is then described, starting with its museum accession number and any comment where this may have been altered. This is followed by reference to plate and figure numbers. Limitations of space on some of the plates restricted giving the drawings museum numbers for further cross-referencing with the text. In most cases the figure numbers are succeeded by a series of further references; these are to comparative sources, either to objects housed in or already published from museums, or to specific, original drawings made to illustrate artefacts seen or collected on early voyages. The selection of sources is based on certain, or allegedly, very early materials, but is arbitrary and far from comprehensive, for several important sources have not been consulted. Plates from older publications are assigned their original Roman numerals and British Museum numbers are given where they have only lately been published. Item numbers are bracketed. The references to material at the Pitts-Rivers Museum of Oxford are to numbers in a typescript list kindly supplied by Mr 4.

The references to Duff 1969 are to a composite display from a number of collections, including the former Oldman one, though efforts have been made not to duplicate references to the same object. One cannot refer to the Oldman catalogue without some caution: not all of the collection was of uniformly ancient pieces and though Oldman was a remarkably perceptive connoisseur of Oceanic material culture, and made great efforts to establish the provenance of his specimens, one may not use his catalogue as an unassailable authority on pre-European Maori culture. The remainder of the descriptions are self-evident: they consist of short outlines for identification, tables of dimensions, extended descrip tions of special features, discussions and, in some cases, inferences con cerning the function, significance or role of the object.

Of these, only one (No. 70) has been found and drawn; however, the others were noted and sketched in a now obsolete card index system, evidently by Dr H. D. Skinner in 1918. These hooks were all two-piece bait hooks.(5) Another hook in the collection was obtained on the First Voyage and came to the university through the Pennant Collection, ultimately from Sir Joseph Banks. This hook (25.392) is of the composite lure or "barracouta" type. D1914.69, 71, 72. Pl. VII, figs 38, 39. These are the three hooks unlocated in 1968, but Skinner's sketches were copied and his notes are reproduced here: Four fish-hooks attached to one snood. Three are of one type [U shaped] and one of another [V shaped], this last appears designed to be bound with flax at the bottom of the curve. Apparently the drawn specimen (D1914.70) was one of the group of three. D1914. Pl. I, fig. 8. Duperry 1826 XL (17); Moschner 1955 (nr. 112); Oldman 1946 (101-106); Parkinson 1784 XXVI (3, 8, 10). Large composite bait hook with bone point lashed to a curved wooden shank, which is in turn snooded to a trace of plaited fibre. The trace is now extended by the addition of a further 35 cm. of finer plaitwork, into the middle of which is a lenticular sectioned, semi-translucent stone "sinker'*. This piece was recorded separately as item 16 in the Trinity College inventory and judging by the lightness of the line there is no reason to suppose that the two pieces originally belonged together. The most archaeologically distinctive feature of the hook is its fairly massive bone point, which falls approximately into type C5 (small point with strongly bent tip) of Hjarno's South Island classification/e) However, because of its external barbing, the point stylistically resembles none illustrated from that area and corresponds more closely to the extensive series found archaeologically in the North Island sites of Oruarangi and Paterangi, where it falls into Type 2 of the Shawcross and Terrell classification/7) The numerous barbs, which are probably ornamental in the manner of the notching observed by Hjarno, are not recorded on this type of point from Oruarangi, though they are found on the Type 3 (dog tooth barbed points), from the same sites. Judging from the size, sharks and dolphins could be the only marine animals of sufficient size in New Zealand waters to go for bait hooks of this size: it says much for the skill in binding and strength of flax line as well as fishing skill that such gear could effectively land creatures which can snap modern heavy tackle. 25.382.

It is of a form well known in the South Island particularly and generally called a barracouta hook.(8) This fits the ascription well, for the barracouta is relatively rare north of Cook Strait. These hooks are simply made, consisting of a rough, rectangular-sectioned wooden shank, drilled and countersunk for snooding and perforated to hold a strong, sharp point. The point on this specimen is large and notched on its outer edge, corresponding to Hjarno's Type A2. It is ingeniously fitted to the shank by wedges and a locking pin. The present specimen seems to be large for its kind and, indeed, the attached line, only 2 mm. in diameter, seems hardly adequate, when barracouta may be caught up to two metres long. The serrations on the point are shown by Hjarno to be characteristic of a number of late South Island assemblages. Certainly such points are not found in the Hauraki Plains collections, nor, for that matter, in comparable material seen by the author in Taranaki. technology: edge-tools This class is represented by two "adze" blades made of greenstone, and by four spalls of obsidian. D1914.49. PL I, fig. 6 (a) (b). Parkinson 1784 XXVI (23?); Pitt-Rivers (1159). Quadrangular-sectioned, double-bevel tool, with sides splayed out to a broad cutting edge. The raw material can be identified as probably nephrite. The butt shows clear signs of battering which must presumably have been caused by hammering during use. Dimensions: length 46 mm.; breadth 44 mm.; thickness 10 mm. The size and proportions conform closely to No. 53 from Paterangi(9) except that the latter is not made in greenstone and perhaps because of this, is thicker. D1914.50. Pl. I, fig. 7 (a) (b). Quadrangular-sectioned, single-bevel tool, parallel-sided and with a rather thin butt. Some signs of battering but also patches of striated use-polish, parallel with the long axis. Dimensions: length 54 mm.; breadth 31 mm.; thickness 8 mm.: this blade also resembles a greenstone tool from Paterangi, No. 54, except that it is a little lighter. Both of the present blades would fall into the smallest sized quarter of the adzes measured from the Paterangi and Oruarangi sites(10) and suggest the possibility of a distinctive class of small-sized blade. It is interesting to note that the original catalogue refers to "edge tools" and not adzes and this has some significance in any discussion of function. According to present typology, these would be described as unhafted adze blades (Type 2b of the Duff classification); however, it is reasonable to doubt if they were intended to be employed as adzes. The reasons for such a view are that they were collected un-hafted (though No. 50 shows polish which may have been caused by hafting); also their size, in par ticular their relative shortness, renders them ill-proportioned for direct 8. Hjarno 1967:15. 9. Shawcross and Terrell 1966:421. 10. ibid.:423. 310</page><page sequence="7">WILFRED SHAWCROSS hafting. Here again, the difficulty could be overcome if there were evidence for the use of an intermediate socket, but though such are known, none was collected or recorded. Inspection of the butt ends of the blades shows bruising, as if they were used like chisels or wedges, a feature which is even more obvious on similar-sized blades made of softer stone, for example the specimen excavated from the Kauri Point swamp site.(11) No comprehensive study has been made of Maori woodworking techno nology, its range of tools and their uses. Recently published discussions appear to base their functional identifications on little more than informed guessing. If, as seems likely, these two blades were obtained un-hafted, some method of use may be sought for them. Three possibilities come to mind: use as hand-held knives, as hand-held chisels or as free-standing wedges. If they were knives they are unnecessarily stout for the kind of force exerted on them and would represent an uneconomic use of precious raw material. As chisels they are stout enough to withstand percussion, but are inconveniently short in relation to their blade widths unless hafted. A modern, carpenter's chisel with a 1 in. (25 mm.) blade has a proportionate length of 1:8.5, while a wood carver's straight-edged chisel with a blade width of 13 mm. has a proportion of 1:19. On the other hand, these blades would be well suited as wedges, a tool almost extinct in present times owing to machine sawing of timber. A wedge seems a logical tool for the Maori, most of whose timber would be straight grained, clean-splitting pine. Splitting and shingling can be relatively rapid, with little waste of timber and if well done require hardly any finishing, while producing a billet, plank or shingle less subject to warping than sawn timber. No further proof can be offered that these tools were indeed wedges, but such an explanation seems likely. Parkinson is specific about the use of these tools as wedges as well as their occasional lashing for use as "hatchets" and "hoes". D1914.51. Pl. I, fig. 4 (a) (b) (c) (d). Pitt-Rivers. These four obsidian spalls are the simplest of all the artefacts in the collection and it is remarkable that they were collected at all. The obsidian is streaky-grey, of low quality, blemished with spherulites. None of the pieces shows primary bulbs of percussion or striking-platforms and may all have been produced by shattering rather than percussion-flaking. When drawn, (c) and (d) appeared to have been produced by thermal fracturing; (a) and (b) show extensive signs of use in the form of very small, conchoidal fracturing along the edges and also the development of notching from more concentrated use;(12) they also reveal traces of red ochre lodged in surface irregularities; (c) is like a small, worked-out core, but it would be impossible to distinguish in the present case whether the final flakes were removed in order to make other tools or to sharpen the present one. The function of these pieces of obsidian is unknown. The use mafks indicate working of some fairly durable material, while the red ochre could reflect some purpose connected with magic, such as scarification, or could have been quite accidentally derived from the 11.

The collection is too small to treat statistically as an industry, but a comparison with the Kauri Point flake industry(13) shows that all four pieces lie within the general size and shape of 95% of this assemblage and two within 85%. The size of the concave working-edge on (a) is within the most frequent class from Kauri Point. On the other hand, the average length of 15 mm. of seven use-marked cutting edges is very much greater than the comparable figures from Kauri Point, suggesting at least some emphasis on different, if equally unknown, functions. warfare: weapons Maori warfare is particularly strongly represented in the Cambridge collection, and is also significant in three other Cook collections, at Vienna, Stockholm and Oxford, where there are five, four and five weapons respectively. This may show a definite, selective bias towards collecting weapons, though whether the selectivity was on the part of the explorers or the Maori is not obvious from the journals. The "Instructions" issued to Captain Cook at the outset of his voyage do not emphasise observation of military strength among newly discovered peoples. On the other hand, to the naval element of the expedition it may have been second nature to gather military trophies. It is not so obvious why the Maori were ready to part with their certainly valuable, laboriously made, personal weapons. Again, there is no account of their receiving anything equivalent in return, though an understanding of Maori practices would indicate that they were not trading, but making gifts. One may suspect that this collection of weapons is the sum of a number of handsome gestures which have never been completely reciprocated. Two classes may be distinguished: single-handed, sharp-edged clubs, and double-handed, pointed and edged staves. They epitomise the close physical contact and personal nature of Maori warfare, hand to hand and at arm's length.(14) Fighting at a greater distance, by long spear and missile is not represented in the collection, and only a single whip-sling kotaha at Stockholm is material evidence for longer-range fighting.(15) Single-handed clubs, generic name patu D1914.56.

Plain, symmetrical spatulate club with ridged, knobbed butt, made of bone, presumably whale, called "hand club (mere) cachelot bone" in the Museum accession list. Buck names this form patu paraoa.il7) Dimensions : length 424 mm. ; breadth 85 mm. ; thickness 22 mm. ; weight 728 gm. Condition, good; several lenticular shaped marks in the drawing are natural channels in the bone. There is one area of slight bruising damage close to the channel farthest from the handle. The bruises look as if they were caused by hammering and were probably sustained during the century in the Trinity College library. D1914.58. Pl. II, fig. 16.

Ornamented, asymmetrical wooden club with butt shaped as a human mask and a full human figure, in low relief, on a swelling of the ridge of the concave blade. The convex blade has no notch, which distinguishes many other specimens. This type is called wahaika by Buck.(18) Dimen sions: length 409 mm.; breadth 105 mm.; thickness of blade 26 mm.; weight 510 gm. This weapon resembles a smaller specimen in the Stock holm collection (1848.1.1) and two in the Vienna collection (v. 3, v. 4), but differs from the Stockholm one in carving style. In the latter the human figures on the butt and blade are entire, if rather simple and egg-like. In No. 58 the butt consists of a mask only, which is conceived in an unusual fashion with the mouth on one plane, at right angles to the plane of the rest of the face. The human figure on the blade though admittedly large-headed, is more naturalistic. Lastly, the point where the convex and concave blades join is marked by a small conically drilled hole. H. D. Skinner is evidently describing this actual specimen when he suggests that such a hole was intended for the suspension of orna mental feathers/19) D1914.59. Pl. II, fig. 15. Small, asymmetrical, slightly ornamented bone club. Dimensions: length 253 mm.; breadth 81 mm.; thickness of blade 16 mm.; weight 240 gm. Condition, good; the bone is pierced by several natural channels as in No. 57, some of which have been ground out in manufacture. The form is evidently relatable to No. 58 and may be called a wahaika; how ever, instead of anthropomorphic decorations the whole design seems to be an animal profile, in which the butt represents the head with eye and a notch for the mouth, and the swelling on the concave blade a forelimb.

Decoration, finish and condition: the only ornament is the almost universal, parallel grooving of the knobbed butt; the underside of the blade preserves some of the tissue structure of the inside of the bone and the condition is good. Discussion. The Maori names may be treated as archaeological types, making at least four types in current use in the late eighteenth century. The variability within an extant population is even more apparent in measurable terms: the average length for the group is 367 mm., but the range is between 253 and 445 mm. Even more extreme is the variation in weight, with an average of 638 gm., but a range of between 240 and 918 gm. There is little ethnographic record of how, or by whom, this kind of weapon was made, but the diversity in raw materials, shape, dimensions and style of decoration argue for individual, local and isolated craftsmen. In 1916 H. D. Skinner put forward a scheme for the evolution in New Zealand of such forms as the wahaika and kotiate by progressive developments from the narrow greenstone adze. The argument is based on the presence of a number of specimens of the latter?perforated at the butt, several rather intermediate forms, and evidence that the patu was used as a thrusting weapon and not as a club.(21) The argument might further be strengthened by a virtual absence from early archaeo logical sites of any identifiable weapons/22) suggesting an internal develop ment. The relevance of such a discussion lies in the more general one of the growth of warfare and its manifestation in the defensive site or pa in New Zealand. But ethnological seriation has long been questioned and, in the present instance, is further weakened by the evident con temporaneity of several of its proposed stages. It may also be added that there is no archaeological evidence for the antiquity of the perforated greenstone adze. However, these artefacts must have some ancestry and whether they are an independent innovation or derived from ancestral prototypes is a question which taxes ethnological theory to its limits. Two-handed clubs The long wooden club, held in both hands, was basic to warfare through out much of Oceania. But, in New Zealand above all, the simple stave was developed as a weapon for thrusting with both fore and back-hand strokes, as well as striking with the edge of one blade-shaped end. Three varieties made in wood seem to have been preferred at the time of the 20. Buck 1958:278-80. 21. Skinner 1916. 22. Golson 1959:46-7. 316</page><page sequence="13">WILFRED SHAWCROSS explorers' visits: these were the pouwhenua, symmetrical and spatulate at one end and pointed at the other; the taiaha, also symmetrical and spatulate at one end with the other expanded into a spear-shaped tongue; and the tewhatewha, in which the spatulate end was asymmetrically shaped into a single edge, axe-like blade, while the other end was pointed. As Peter Buck has recognised, the staff weapon was not abandoned with the introduction of firearms, but was adapted to the new warfare,(23) and indeed, one variety at least, the taiaha, has been retained up to the present day as a ceremonial weapon, and with it the formalised drill of weapon, body and foot movements. It is said that Maori soldiers as late as the Second World War were particularly adept at bayonet fighting because of practice with the taiaha. All three varieties were collected on Captain Cook's first voyage and are represented in the Cambridge collection, which possesses two pou whenua, one taiaha and one tewhatewha. D1914.61. Pl.

Polished wood staff with blade ending in an arc and the pointed end carved as a mask with extended tongue, shown enlarged in Pl. V, fig. 33. Dimensions: length 184.5 cm.; width of blade 8.5 cm. This is probably what Banks compared with a "spontoon",(24) a European, pike-like weapon with a straight blade, which must have been obsolescent by the time Banks was writing. It is almost certainly also what Cook called a "Serjeant's halbard".(25) The mask point is very elaborately carved and includes a perforation in the forehead, probably for the attachment of feathers; eyes are inset with discs of shell, notched round the edges; and the tongue is engraved with four double spirals. These four spirals seem characteristic of the taiaha tongue, whatever stylistic variability there may be between heads. Within the repertoire of motifs used by the Maori carver it seems to have been a regular practice to terminate the grain end of any long piece with an anthropomorphic head, or visual pun on penis and head. A further, logical step, for a weapon, would be to extend the tongue into a spear-like point, which in turn becomes another sort of visual pun, because, as the early explorers saw, the Maori warrior expressed defiance to his opponent by grimaces and sticking out the tongue/2e) D1914.62. Pl. Ill, fig. 24, and Pl. I, fig. 11. Duff 1969 (69). Pouwhenua, polished wood staff with arc-shaped blade, carved grips for both hands and a sharp pointed end. Dimensions: 181.5 cm.; maxi mum width of blade 10 cm.; weight 1,275 gm. The positions for both hands were evidently registered by low relief carvings in the appropriate positions. The carving closest to the pointed end has curves which are probably derived from the usual carved mask. The blade-end carvings are more highly finished and superficially resemble manaia (Pl.

The blade-end grip is again in low relief and may be identified as a pair of manaia, with distinctive, tooth-like markings (Pl. I, fig. 5). This decoration relaies stylistically to that on the small flute or kooauau, No. 55, shown expanded in Pl. I, fig. Id. It is a style which though simple enough is also distinctive in Maori wood carving and may well have had some local origin and limited age. D1914.64. Pl. Ill, fig. 22.

Dimensions: length 137 cm.; greatest width of blade 22.5 cm.; weight 1,180 gm. This is presumably the kind of weapon described by Captain Cook as "shaped like an axe"(27) and by Banks as a "battle-axe",(28) and is identified as the Maori tewhatewha by Buck.(29) The left-hand grip is registered by a carving round the shaft based on the face; there is no obvious marking for the right-hand grip, but where the section is drawn the shaft alters shape. The blade has an arc-shaped inner edge apparently intended for chopping blows, rather than for thrusting (though Beaglehole states that the blow was struck, not with the sharp edge but on its blunt back)(30) and it is drilled with a small hole for the attachment of some ornament such as feathers. Discussion. The explorers observed these three kinds of weapon quite frequently and went so far as to compare them with European arms. A fourth type, of bone, more specifically whale rib, is also recorded. Banks compared it also to a "spontoon"(31) and it is clearly illustrated in one of Parkinson's original drawings (B.M. Add. MS. 23920.f.46), repro duced by Beaglehole as Plate II in Vol. II of Banks' Journal, and hereafter called "Parkinson 46". There seems no strong reason to accept Buck's statement that the whale rib weapon or hoeroa was particularly ancient.(32) Buck's source for this information is not now looked on as a reliable guide to early Maori history.(33) The illustrations show that it was still in use at the time of the explorers, and at least four are preserved in the Oldman collection.(34) However, the significance of the identification of Maori weapons with European ones lies not in any apparent physical similarity, but in who used them. Both Cook and Banks in their descrip tions, and in their use of terms like "halbard" and "spontoon" are clearly indicating that their users were exercising authority. In the eighteenth century such archaic weapons were still carried by non-commissioned 27. Cook, in Beaglehole 1955:200. 28. Banks, in Beaglehole 1963 11:27. 29. Buck 1958:274. 30.

If the above reasoning is correct, then clearly not every Maori warrior was armed with a staff weapon. This seems to be borne out by the visual record; particularly Parkinson's drawings of war canoes. Here, however, there is some difficulty. Parkinson's work is best known in engravings, but the original war canoe seems to exist in two separate, finished wash drawings: that noted previously and also one very similar, reproduced as PI. 38 by Beaglehole in his edition of Cook's first voyage (B.M. Add. MS. 23920.50), hereafter called "Parkinson 50". If these represented two separate scenes they would be statistically more useful as a record of the military hierarchy of the Maori. But comparison suggests that these drawings are artistic composites. In each the prow and stern are admittedly good representations of two quite separate styles of wood carving. Unfortunately, too many of the same crew appear in both. At the prow of each there is a young boy with a barbed spear, probably the tao, of which there are three examples in the Oldman collection.(35) In Parkinson 46 there are also in the prow three cloaked and garlanded figures, reduced to two in Parkinson 50. The foremost standing figure in both canoes is brandishing a tewhatewha and is wearing a vertically striped, loose garment which may be a hitherto unrecognised form of Maori cloak. At the stern of each there is an elderly, bearded man holding a taiaha. The rest of the figures are not so certainly identifiable, but seem to be reorganised in different postures. There remains a third animated scene of a double war-canoe, drawn by H. D. Sporing,(3e) which is clearly of another scene and vessel. With the qualification of the Parkinson drawings in mind, a simple count of the kinds and pro portions of weapons and crew illustrated will give some idea of the numbers of warriors. In Parkinson 46 there is a total crew of 27, of whom two carry taiaha, one a tewhatewha, two patu onewa, one a tao and one a hoeroa. In Parkinson 50, 23 figures may be seen, with again two taiaha and one tewhatewha, but more single-handed arms become apparent, with three patu onewa, four kotiate, and again a single tao. The double canoe shown by Sporing is a much better proportioned vessel and is remarkable for the liveliness of the human figures; it has a crew of some 57, with only one each of taiaha, tewhatewha, patu, kotiate, wahaika, but an increase of seven long spears of which one is a barbed tao. In each drawing the remaining crew members appear unarmed, or brandish paddles only, from which it may fairly be concluded that the two-handed and indeed one-handed clubs were not the weapons of the ordinary Maori but were confined to a significantly smaller group. If the staff weapons were badges of rank, Parkinson's evidence would restrict this power to an eighth of the total, while Sporing's would reduce it to a twenty-eighth. If the more common, one-handed clubs are included, the proportions are increased to roughly one-third and one-tenth respec tively. Whatever the proportions, such a general conclusion raises 35. ibid.:19. 36. Pl. 3 in Beaglehole 1963 II. 319</page><page sequence="16">CAMBRIDGE COLLECTION OF MAORI ARTEFACTS questions about the nature of pre-European warfare. The fully-armed man was apparently less common than has been supposed and it looks as if a proportion of the able-bodied men of a war party may have been poorly armed and vulnerable to their superiors on either side. transportation: paddles Canoes, paddles, sails and navigation were, as might be expected, well observed on the voyages of exploration. Measured descriptions of the size and capacity of canoes were recorded and the expedition draughtsmen made drawings of canoes in use and their carving details. No canoe furniture seems to have been brought back to Europe, with the exception of an unknown number of paddles. The West portrait of Joseph Banks shows a Maori paddle as a trophy(37) and a water colour drawing by J. F. Miller shows three paddles (the best reproduction appears to be on the cover of R. A. Skelton's Captain James Cook After Two Hundred Years). There is now one paddle preserved in the Vienna Cook collec tion/3 8) and two in the Cambridge collection. They, or at least one, present an unexpected problem which will be examined below. D1914.66 and 67. Pl. Ill, fig. 21 (a) (b). Pl. V, fig. 32. Cook 1964 (7); Miller, BM. Add. MS. 23920.71a; Moschner 1955 (nr. 24); Oldman 1946 (52); Parkinson 1784 XXVI (2). Two wooden paddles of obviously Maori design, consisting of sharply elliptical, leaf-shaped blades, joined to the shafts with boldly carved masks or manaia and with the ends of the shafts also carved with a manaia. Dimensions: the total length of each paddle is about 180 cm. and the width of the blades nearly 15 cm. The finish of the wood is matt and rather rough and the colour is drab. In fig. 21 the faded pattern on the underside has been transposed as accurately as possible to the topside. There is also an inscription, now illegible, written in a heavy, old-fashioned copperplate style which would merit decipherment. The ink of this writing has faded to the same tone as the painted designs. Judging from Miller's watercolour, the original tint of the design was red, but it was evidently not a permanent colour and has faded to a dark tone of drabness. Initially it was thought that the paddles may have been the same as those drawn by Miller; the style of carved head at the base of the blade, the painted patterns of scrolls and irregular, thick, curvilinear patterns are similar; but further comparison showed that the Cambridge paddles were not the same as those illustrated. J. F. Miller was not a draughtsman on the first voyage, but was employed by Joseph Banks to illustrate his collections from the first voyage and was intended to accompany his employer on the ambitiously planned second voyage/3 9) It seems that the Miller paddles and that in the West portrait of Banks must have been retained in the Banks collection, but none of these came to Cambridge through the Pennant collection. The motifs of the painting are well-known for they are found in rafter 37. Beaglehole 1963 1:68-9. 38. Moschner 1955 :no. 37. 39. Beaglehole 1963 1:73. 320</page><page sequence="17">WILFRED SHAWCROSS patterns and are based on scrolls (kor?) which are identified by some with fern fronds. So far there is nothing unexpected about the paddles. A detail drawing of the carved manaia head, from which the blade issues like a tongue (Pl. V, fig. 32) reveals a rather idiosynchratic style of carving. While its composition can be made out at a distance, closer inspection is bewildering due to the deep, gashed chiselling, giving an encrusted, rococo effect which is, incidentally, extremely difficult to draw. The ornamentation consists of bands, whose edges are broken by triangular serrations, not unlike that on the famous Te Kaha carvings from the southern Bay of Plenty, but the execution is infinitely cruder and is indeed so deep cutting as to make one wonder if it could have been achieved with stone tools at all. The question of what kind of tool was employed is serious: it seems clear that a V sectioned gouge must have been used (in modern Maori carving this is an essential tool, called a pakati chisel,(40) but such tools can only be made of metal and as far as is known no stone equivalent exists. In addition, one of the paddles is unfinished and the periphery of its blade shows diagonal marks which can only reasonably be explained as having been cut by a toothed rip-saw. Tests were carried out at the time of drawing by Mr Lilley, of the Cambridge University Museum, on selected timbers, with different grades of saw, and these left no doubt that the marks were caused by a steel saw with fairly coarse, relieved, offset teeth. European influence is further indicated by the fading of the decorative patterns, for the best-known Maori pigment is red ochre, which is permanent. No satisfactory explanation can be offered for this curious situation. The paddles were certainly collected on the first voyage, stylistically they are undoubtedly Maori, and it is impossible to believe that they are subsequent forgeries or substitutes. A possible explanation might be that the Endeavour's carpenters were employed roughing out paddles which were then finished by Maori craftsmen. The paddles are unfinished and also clumsy and ill balanced, as Mr Lilley, a former oarsman, pointed out. But there is no account in the journals of any such co-operative activity in producing what may well be New Zealand's oldest tourist trade goods. CLOTHING The subject of Maori clothing has recently been studied definitively by Dr S. M. Mead, in his monograph Traditional Maori Clothing (1969), in which he has paid particular attention to early documentation and materials collected on Captain Cook's voyages, notably those preserved in the British Museum and reported on by Ling Roth and those in the Ethnographic Museum of Stockholm. The material in the Cambridge collection suggests no significant modifications to Mead's study, but adds amplification or confirmation on a number of points. Clothes are, after weapons, the most frequent class of material repre sented in the collection, and the relative ease with which the explorers 40. Mead 1961:27. 321</page><page sequence="18">CAMBRIDGE COLLECTION OF MAORI ARTEFACTS obtained them is also reflected in the Stockholm collection. It is also amazing to note how well the textiles have survived two centuries, during much of which time they can scarcely have been preserved under ideal conditions. When handled in the course of drawing all the plant fibres appeared to have retained much of their original pliability and only the strips of presumed dog-skin showed any brittleness. The drawing of the textiles The problems of detail and scale are most obvious in drawing textiles. The cloaks have the greatest dimensions in the collection, the largest being over 1 metre by 2.5. Yet the texture of their weaving is in some cases extremely delicate, measurable in fractions of a millimetre. It would be intolerably laborious to make a completely accurate drawing, and impossible to reproduce one. The solution here has been to present the cloaks in a standardised layout, all drawn to a common scale, and revealing inner and outer surfaces, giving some idea of the shape of the garment. Details are shown in selected areas only and drawn as close as possible to scale. It is hoped that this will show something of the qualities and individual textures of the specimens. As in the whole of this paper, the identification of raw materials has been treated with caution. It is fair to assume that the vegetable fibres are usually New Zealand flax, but as this writer would be unable to identify other fibres it seems wiser not to compound errors by assumed exactness. This is, in a small way, an effort to break the chain of unverified assumption that transforms so readily into ethnological fact. The present collection consists of four "cloaks" and three "belts", as against five of each in Stockholm. Cloaks D24.80. Pl. IV, fig. 28. Duff 1969 (36); Oldman 1946 (159); Pitt-Rivers (1132, 1137); Parkinson 1784 XXV; Ryden 1963 (1848.1.63, 1848.1.5). This cloak is made from plant fibres and strips of skin. Dimensions: upper edge 123 cm.; lower 126 cm.; height 88.5 cm. The body of the cloak is unshaped, but the left selvedge (viewer's right) is increased from two rows at the top to five at the bottom, which helps to account a little for the increased length of the lower hem. A further feature is that the cloak is fitted with what may be called "false selvedges", made of plaited strips which are attached to the true selvedge at about 2 cm. intervals by fibre tacking, and to which are tied small, dog-hair tags at intervals of about 10 to every 5.5 cm. The upper edge of the cloak is simple, formed only of a plait, to which are attached two loops, about 25 cm. from each end. On the left loop there is a lace, 26 cm. long, which presumably tied to the other loop, holding the cloak round its wearer's neck, thus requiring no cloak-pin. The skin strips were between 3 and 4 mm. wide; the thickness of one was measured on a micrometer and found to be 0.012 in. (0.35 mm.). The lengths of a number of strips were measured with the idea that they might show the size of the animals from which they came. The shortest 322</page><page sequence="19">WILFRED SHAWCROSS was 52 cm., another 55 cm. but most were about 63 cm. long and a few may have been extended to the full length of the cloak. In a recent study of the Maori dog, J. Allo has calculated an average shoulder height of 37 cm., from a study of skeletal populations.(41) Using her diagram of the proportions of a Maori dog it was possible to measure the length from nose to croup, which, on the average animal would be about 66.5 cm., and nose to tip of tail 89 cm. These dimensions accord very closely with the measurements taken from the present cloak, suggesting that the pelt of the dog was cut longitudinally into strips which would include the head, tail and limbs where possible. The lower border is more complex. It consists of a band of black bordered by white fibres to which a thick band of skin tags are attached on the outside; these tags are doubled and about 13 cm. long. The body is made of fine woven plant fibres, internally showing 62 warps and 69 wefts within 10 cm. The warps of skin are attached on the outside and are at approximately 20 strips to 10 cm. They are attached to the body by 51 rows of wefts. D24.81. Pl. IV, fig. 27. Ryden 1963 (1848.1.6, 1848.1.64). Rain cape, the original "thrummed mat" of the explorers, belonging to Class P5, kahu toi of Mead's classification. This term is derived from an earlier system and depends on the identification of the toi element fibres from the cordyline indivisa (in popular language a kind of cabbage tree). As noted earlier, no claims are made here to accurate identification of raw materials, but this specimen closely resembles 1848.1.6 in the Stockholm collection. The cape is a fine specimen, in excellent condition, though now with slightly irregular dimensions. Upper hem 136 cm.; lower hem 125 cm. Wearer's left selvedge 102 cm.; right selvedge 108 cm. The distinctive features of these capes are the fibre tags attached to the outer surface, which presumably served to deflect rain, rather as thatch does, from the body of the cape, which has no other obvious rain repelling features. In the present specimen the upper hem consists of a heavy braid of four strands, to which is attached a lace. On the outer surface the uppermost three or four rows of tags are set together par ticularly densely, giving a ruffed collar. The tags are made of fibres about 14 cm. long, which have a natural, anti-clockwise twist. The body of the cloak is made by single pair twining of wefts, and is shaped in two areas; that is, the number of wefts starting from the side (there are no selvedges on this cape) are increased towards the middle. There are 69 rows on the edge, which increases to 74 at the middle. The upper insert commences at row 15 and the lower at row 47. Measure ments of texture give 4.3 warps per cm., while the distance between wefts varies between 0.68 and 0.77 wefts per cm. D24.83. Pl. IV, fig. 26. (References as for D24.81.) An old label, written in italic script, says "Thrumm cloth No. 24 from New Zealand". This is a rain cape, conforming to Mead's class P5, kahu toi. It is smaller, but rather more complex in manufacture than No. 81. Dimensions: upper hem 95 cm.; lower hem 101 cm.; height 41. Allo 1970:74. 323</page><page sequence="20">CAMBRIDGE COLLECTION OF MAORI ARTEFACTS 69 cm. The height is effectively increased a further 12 cm. at the lower hem by a fringe of tags, and an additional 6 cm. through extension of the warps beyond the upper hem. The tags or thrums are twisted anti clockwise and are about 20 cm. long, doubled over. They are tied at intervals of three weft rows and are some 10 cm. apart. The body of the cape is made by double pair interlocking weft twining, with the upper hem of the same double pair wefts, while the lower is thickened by closing together three rows of double pair wefts. In addition, this cape has sehedges of twisted braid which are the outermost warps. The body is shaped, with two inserts, the number of weft rows being 36 at the selvedge (excluding hems), and 43 rows in the middle. The texture is fine, worked at a rate of 5 warps per cm. and between 0.53 and 0.64 weft rows per cm. D24.84. Pl. IV, fig. 25. Duff 1969 (35); Moschner 1955 (nr. 25); Ryden 1963 (1848.1.63). Large, finely-made cloak with a broad, decorated lower border of light and dark taaniko. It appears to be a unique specimen but can be fitted in Mead's class Kl (neko) of kaitaka cloaks. Dimensions: when fully laid out the upper hem is 250 cm. long, reducing to 242 cm. on the lower hem. The tagged false selvedge is 106 cm. long and its untagged opposite is 110 cm. The size of the cloak and presence of a single, tagged selvedge suggest that the cloak was intended to be worn doubled back on itself, giving an effective length of 125 cm., which corresponds closely to the other cloaks and capes. The fabric of this cloak is remarkably fine and in excellent condition, still soft and pliant. The body is plain woven of a brown coloured fibre, though unfortunately at the time of drawing it was not recorded whether single or double pair twist wefts were employed. The texture of the warps was measured as 5.6 per cm., and wefts as 5.2 per cm., and the thickness of the body, measured by micrometer, as 1.14 mm. (0.045 in.), while the thickness of the taaniko was 1.65 mm. (0.065 in.). A thin, tapering false selvedge is attached on the wearer's right border and along it are tied, at roughly centimetre intervals, bunches of small tags. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the cloak is the broad band of decorative weaving, some 31 cm. deep, along the lower border. It is possible that a close inspection might reveal traces of colouring as described by Mead for his "black and yellow" bordered cloaks,(42) but no such colours were observed at the time of examination. The design consists of alternating panels with a motif, either of vertical herring-bone, or light spots on a dark ground; the lengths of the panels are not uniform, being 37.5, 68.5, 47.5, 55.0 and 24.5 cm. respectively. No satisfactory method of drawing these motifs was devised, but the accompanying analytical drawing, Pl. VII, fig. 40, shows the structure of the herring bone, with its light-coloured, vertical zigzags; it also shows part of the lower border, which is made of seven rows of twisted fibre, the upper four of mixed dark and light fibres, the fifth dark and the sixth and seventh dark and light. It was not observed whether human hair was 42.

Mead has recognised the uniqueness of the Greek Key motif, featured on the Stockholm dog-skin cloak 1848.1.63.(43) Inspection of Ryden's plate 35 reveals that the upper and lower borders of the taaniko are decorated with a vertical, herring-bone motif which is the major one in the present cloak. The patterns on these two cloaks are not only extremely finely executed and restrained, but contrast with the exuberant design of triangles and lozenges on the cloak worn by Joseph Banks in his portrait by Benjamin West.(44) The latter has a visual impact at a distance, like almost all later taaniko work illustrated by Mead, whereas the Stockholm and Cambridge specimens only reveal their designs on closer inspection, and have the secret qualities of damask cloth whose richness is more apparent to the possessor than the onlooker. The evidence of this cloak supports Mead's contention that weaving patterns were in a state of transition prior to European contact,(45) and goes some way towards checking a currently-spreading view which tends to ascribe all significant change to post-European times. Belts Belts, of the kind to be described, seem to have disappeared quite rapidly from the repertoire of Maori handicrafts after contact with Europeans. These early ethnographic specimens are distinctively bulky, folded over several times, and in some examples lightly stitched, while each end consists of a long lace, so that the whole belt would have been wound several times round the body. The weight and width of these specimens suggests the heavy, webbing belts worn by modern soldiers and there may be some functional similarity since they would give a little protection to the stomach and kidneys, besides supporting gear, as shown clearly in Parkinson's drawing of a standing chief, wearing a dog-skin cloak and belt, into which is thrust a club. D1914.45. Pl. V, fig. 29. Pitt-Rivers (1182); Ryden 1963 (1848.1.36-40). Twilled belt with a total length of 250 cm. and width of 9 cm., of which the body is about 160 cm. long and the laces are each some 45 cm. The laces are plaited from twists of fibre, tapering from a narrow end, tied in a knot and tassel, and expanding until the braids are separated, at which point the twisted fibres of each round-sectioned braid are transformed into what appear to be four-ply, flat-sectioned braids. From here they are fanned out to join the flat section of the belt proper, which is achieved through a transverse, reinforcing band of two-ply wefts 15 mm. broad. The ends of the lace braids are finally sewn into the body of the belt which is made in an entirely different fashion of twilled strips of plant fibre. The sewn ends of the lace braids are once more transformed to twisted fibres from braiding and show, on inspection, traces of red ochre, probably transferred from body paint. The centre of the belt was 43. Rydenl963:figs30, 35. 44. Beaglehole 1963 1:68-9. 45.

This part of the belt is made of medium textured, simple twilling, without any introduction of coloured patterns, but with a variation in the twilling which may be seen in a close inspection of the middle line: the texture of the twilling may be expressed as 3 strands per cm. D1914.46. Pl. V, fig. 30. (References as for D1914.45.) The original label was re-numbered three times and is difficult to read, but the number here seems the most satisfactory choice. This specimen closely resembles No. 45; its total length is 223 cm., width 9 cm. and body length 160 cm. The laces are plaited braids of twisted fibre, 27 and 36 cm long, tapering to knotted ends, and fanning out at their inner ends into some five, flattened, four-ply braids which are reinforced by a transverse band, again showing traces of red ochre and formed this time of two-pair interlocking wefts, covering the final sewing of the lace braids to the body. The body is again folded over into quarters, but is this time tacked together along tbe seam by a twisted string. The body is twilled, without any patterns or variations observed, but its texture is somewhat finer with 4 strands per cm. D1914.48. Pl. V, fig. 31. (Reference as for D1914.45.) There is a metal tag on this belt marked "TC, 14.43", indicating some ambiguity over the cataloguing. This belt is clearly related to the two preceding; however, it is not only larger, but made with a different technique and a quality of workmanship which ranks it as an outstanding specimen. Dimensions: total length 319 cm., consisting of 198 cm. of body and laces of 55 and 66 cm. The width of the body is 12 cm. The laces are braided and particularly long, tapering to a narrow diameter at the knotted points. The proximal ends of the laces are made of a combination of plaited and twisted braids which fan out to some eighteen strands to join the body of the belt without an obvious reinforcing band. The braids are flat and seem to have been made in the form of ribbons of three sets of two-pair interlocking wefts, rather than by true braiding. It is not clear how the laces are joined to the body, though, judging from the inside right end (viewer's left), the braids are sewn through the body and looped back to the lace. The body, as in the other belts, is made of a longitudinally folded sheet which would originally have been the best part of half a metre broad if folded in quarters (it is in effect a small cloak). It is entirely plain but what it lacks in ornament it amply makes up in the fineness and quality of the weaving. This is formed of two-pair interlocking wefts whose texture consists of about 10 warps per cm. and some 11.5 wefts per cm. This is extremely fine and even-textured work and has the regu larity of a machine woven twill. As previously noted, the textiles are in an impressive state of preservation and this particular belt is still most pliable to feel and without the stiffness of the twilled matting belts. It is possible that the raw material or at least the preparation of the fibres was different. The strands of the two smaller belts are fairly glossy and 327</page><page sequence="25">CAMBRIDGE COLLECTION OF MAORI ARTEFACTS pale-coloured, though the laces are darker, whereas this large belt is a dark, reddish-brown colour. General comments. These three belts and the five in the Stockholm collection form a distinctive class, characterised by a body formed of several folds of textile, from each end of which a fan of braids is brought out, joined and formed into a single, tapering lace. Three of the Stock holm belts appear to be twilled with a decorative pattern; the other two are of a simpler, over-and-under matting technique. The twilled Cam bridge specimens are both plain, but appear to be of a slightly finer quality, while the third, two-pair interlocking weft belt is a finer piece of workmanship than any of the other pieces. A technical feature which is apparent in these belts is the ingenious transformation of an intentionally flat-sectioned belt body, through a succession of different textile tech niques, into a round, braided lace which, as in the manufacture of fishing line, is tapered into a fine string, suitable for easy tying. Discussion. At first sight the identification and function of these arte facts seems obvious. But, as will be shown, the role of the belt in Maori clothing deserves some further attention. Mead distinguishes two quite separate classes of waist-band, and would include the three present items within his W-class (taatua) category W2, belts tapering to a point/46) He contrasts with these his A-class (maro and tuu), which includes the A-l, tuu ure or penis girdle, described in the journals of Cook and Banks/47) Banks commented: About their waists was tied a belt from which hung a string which was tied round the preputium and in this seemed to consist most or all of their decency in that particular; for when that was tied they often exposed by different motions every part of their bodies to our view . . ., but showed visible reluctance and signs of shame when we desired them to untie it from a curiosity to see the manner in which it was tied.(48) Mead notes a peculiarity, namely, that while his A-class is so fully described in the journals his W-class is not.(49) Yet the latter is represented in the explorers' collections, but not the former. Briefly, if these were distinct objects, then there are no existing examples of Class A-l. The position may be enlarged as follows. The explorers only brought back examples of the finer quality articles; there may have been a con tinuum between such highly finished objects as No. 48, through the two other plainer specimens, to altogether much simpler and common objects, perhaps no more than a "string", as Banks says. Alternatively, the description given by Banks may be taken literally; that is, a separate string was used to attach the prepuce to the belt, and might easily be mislaid. No fully convincing solution can be offered to the question of the missing tuu uru9 but it might well be that Mead's separate, descriptive 46. ibid.:66. 47. ibid.:63-5. 48. Banks, in Beaglehole 1963 11:15. 49. Mead 1969:66. 328</page><page sequence="26">WILFRED SHAWCROSS and functional classes could refer to the same, formal typological class of object. Ethnological features of the belt. The recent development of Oceanic archaeology has taken over many of the theories and objectives of the preceding era of ethnology, which culminated in the syntheses of Edwin G. Burrows' Western Polynesia, and Bengt Anell's Contribution to the History of Fishing in the Southern Seas, both of which include exhaustive studies of trait distributions. The former, in particular, seeks to distinguish a number of culture areas within Polynesia, by selection of a broad range of traits, both material and social. One weakness of purely ethnological study is the difficulty of defining a point in time at which the evidence is held to be true, and it is probably a good justi fication for Burrows' omission of the simpler articles of clothing from his study. These were certainly widely influenced by pervasive European values of modesty. However, Peter Buck, who made a particular study of Polynesian clothing, has made a general statement that the men's loin-cloth, of bark-cloth, prevailed throughout the area(50) and this could be an echo of Joseph Banks' earlier summary of the manners and customs of the South Sea Islanders, that the men wore a piece of cloth which was passed between their legs and round their waists (mar?), "which keeps up the strictest rules of decency".(51) It must be admitted that Banks had no very wide experience of the Oceanic peoples at the time he wrote. But the general truth seems to have been born out on Captain Cook's second voyage. The Niueans were "naked except their natural parts",(62) a formula which also applied to the Marquesans,(53) while the dress of Tongans, male and female, consisted of a piece of matting or cloth wrapped round the waist from the breast to the knee.(64) "Decency" then, as formulated by Europeans, seems to have been general throughout Polynesia, excepting New Zealand, where there was an individual interpretation. The ethnologist will ask whether this was an example of a local develop ment, by reduction, from the otherwise more substantial Polynesian kilt or loin-cloth, or whether it was a survival. It should be remembered that something more than a mere artefact is represented; rather it is an important social value, of modesty. There is one piece of evidence which brings a little light on the question: the early explorers have recorded the use of a ceremonial belt, worn on formal occasions by high-ranking Tahitians, an example of which is preserved in the Stockholm col lection.(55) Bligh, quoted by Green, describes such a yellow and red feathered maro 'ura, as 12 feet long, half made with yellow feathers traced with red ones, the other half made of red English bunting, which 50.

Ryden 1963:1848.1.61. 329</page><page sequence="27">CAMBRIDGE COLLECTION OF MAORI ARTEFACTS was worn round the hips "in the common manner".(56) This evidence could be taken to suggest the survival, in both New Zealand and the Society Islands, of an early use of the belt among the Polynesians. It had lingered as a rare piece of formal regalia in the Societys, rather like the academic's gown or judge's wig at the present. It had survived as a more general article of clothing in conservative New Zealand. Taking this reasoning a stage further, it is possible to apply the "age area" theory, first applied rigorously in New Zealand by Duff in his analysis of Oceanic adzes. In the present case, the Maori belt of hand-woven fibres may be a local survival of a formerly more general Polynesian clothing, which was replaced after the migrations of the ancestors of the Maori by the development of a far more flexible material, bark-cloth, which among other advantages could be passed between the legs without discomfort to the wearer. The result, either incidentally or intentionally, was an increased level of "decency". To conclude: the purpose of this discussion has not been to trace some supposed point of Maori origin, through a single trait, but to examine the historical relationship between a technological phenomenon, the replacement of fibre belts by bark cloth, and a social phenomenon, "modesty", as observed by the explorers. General comments on clothing Sir Peter Buck introduced two concepts into his study of the evolution of Maori clothing. The first was the idea that New Zealand was originally settled by Polynesians, well adapted to a tropical environment, who already had fully developed bark-cloth manufacture. The second idea was that, under the pressure of a less genial climate, internal, adaptive, technological evolution took place, in which hand weaving with flax fibres was developed and evolved from simple to complex. This approach has been reapplied by D. R. Simmons in a recent analysis of an ancient cloak, found with a mummified burial at Lake Hauroko, Southland. On the evidence of this and several other preserved finds, Simmons proposes a sequence of evolution for the South Island area of Murihiku, commencing with the abandonment of bark-cloth, in favour of large, skin garments which were replaced in successive stages by half-hitch, single-pair twine, and double-pair twine until, about 1800 or later, double-pair twining with shaping was introduced/5 7) These concepts of development out of a tropically evolved ancestry, and independent technical evolution from simple to complex are not only plausible, but are also ethnologically acceptable as a counter to diffusionism, championed at the present by Thor Heyerdahl. There are, however, weaknesses inherent in such schemes. Taking some small points first, the most recent evolutionary outline, which places the introduction of shaping as late as A.D. 1800, does not accord with the evidence for shaping in the cloaks collected on Captain Cook's voyages. Admittedly this may be explained away as a product of regionalism, and Murihiku 56. Green 1968:72, 75. 57. Simmons 1968:14. 330</page><page sequence="28">WILFRED SHAWCROSS has long been held to have been a relatively retarded area,(58) but it should be remembered that no direct evidence exists as to where the explorers collected their cloaks. More serious is the difficulty of con structing evolutionary schemes, within as short a span as a thousand years, from a minimal number of samples whose ages are not exactly known (the previous discussion of belts was not conceived in this sense of "evolutionary"). However, matters become still more difficult when the hypotheses which underlie these evolutionary schemes are examined. What reason is there to suppose that bark-cloth manufacture was well developed, and band weaving poorly so, in tropical Polynesia in the first millennium A.D.? The archaeological evidence for either in Polynesia at an early date is negligible. On the other hand, there is excellent evidence for the great antiquity and high development of hand weaving by single and double pair twining in the American Continent. At Huaca Prieta in Peru, Junius Bird found preserved evidence both for bark-cloth manu facture and twining, with exposed warps as in the Maori cloaks, datable back to 2500-1200 B.C.(59) More recently, the research programme in the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico has extended the age of the twining technique back to the El Riego Phase (4800-3500 B.C.), by the discovery of a twined article with burial 3 at Coxcatlan.(60) In drawing attention to this evidence the objective is not to suggest a new centre of diffusion, but to present a case for the existence of these techniques considerably earlier than any early Polynesian date. It is reasonable therefore to see hand weaving as ancient and widely distributed, and consequently the ancestors of the Maori could well have possessed the technique when they arrived in New Zealand. What then happened would have been a modification and adaptation of an already existing technology, rather than a succession of independent and ever more complex inventions. This offers an equally plausible theory to counter a prevailing one which expects all change to be from simple to complex, at whatever point in time a local sequence may be supposed to start. ORNAMENTS There are three items of personal adornment: a wooden comb, a greenstone ear-drop and a bone toggle (which is normally associated with the suspension of a pendant round the neck). An additional piece is a small, unnumbered tag of (dog) hair. The original Trinity College inventory mentions two ear ornaments, three necklaces, a bodkin and a piece of red ochre, but makes no reference to a toggle. The Cambridge University Reporter of 1914 repeats the comb, necklaces and bodkin as before, but records only one ear-drop and adds a globular looped pendant of calcite and the bone toggle. It was not possible to attempt to trace those articles which were no longer associated with the collection. The globular calcite pendant sounds improbable, but may be what is now attached as a sinker to fish-hook No. 70. There is available a descrip 58. Skinner 1921. 59. Bird and Mahler 1951:75-7. 60.

Wooden comb of asymmetrical design with a fretted ornament on one side. Dimensions: total length 95 mm.; frame length 47 mm.; breadth 50 mm.; thickness 4 mm. There are 22 teeth, giving a tooth frequency of 5.2 per cm. The quality of the finish is outstanding and condition of preservation excellent. This comb so closely resembles specimens excavated from the uppermost deposits of the Kauri Point swamp site(62) as to suggest that they were all made by the same crafts man. The overall dimensions correspond closely with those from the archaeological site, though the teeth are shorter and more frequent than most from the site. The decorative design may be identified as a manaia or head and its execution corresponds closely with several Kauri Point pieces, particularly with its rather large circular head or eye, though it exactly replicates none. The incomplete correspondence is not surprising in view of the observation that out of an estimated total of 187 at Kauri Point no two decorated specimens were exactly the same. Technological observations. It is puzzling to understand how wood can have been so minutely fretted and, in particular, how the teeth can have been cut. There is no common tool in ethnographic collections which could be singled out as suitable. Inspection of the teeth shows slight longitudinal ridges (Pl. I, fig. 3b) formed between them, as if they were cut from each side by a very fine chisel or burin. No stone chisels are recorded which would be fine enough for this work. Though as combs were evidently made by only a few highly skilled specialists it does not follow that their technology should ever have been observed or pre served. However, it is worth examining what kind of tool might be appropriate. Duff illustrates a Tahitian hafted burin whose cutting edge is made from a shark's tooth/e3) This was apparently used for carving fine surface detail. Alternatively, it seems possible that a rat's incisor might have been hafted in a similar manner. If it were possible to haft such a tooth it would have distinct advantages. Several European rat 61.

This specimen has been noted as closely resembling archaeologically excavated pieces from Kauri Point. The earliest combs from this site are associated with a C14 date of A.D. 1552 ? 56 and do not correspond to the ethnographic forms, whereas the later ones do and on this basis the end of the sequence has been dated to about the time of the explorers (the second half of the eighteenth century). This particular comb effectively clinches the argument, though, of course, it is not possible to be certain how old the specimen was before collection, or how old the type was, except in general terms. These combs are related to the simpler forms in which the manaia is reduced to a knob only. A number of wooden examples of these were found at Kauri Point, but there are also cruder and usually larger ones made from bone, which were presumably made by other craftsmen. Examples of these were collected on Cook's voyages and are preserved at Stockholm and Vienna. D1914.36. Pl. I, fig. 9. Moschner 1955 (nr. 20); Oldman 1946 (95); Parkinson 1784 XIX. Greenstone ear-drop or pendant (kurukuru): this is a simple, finely executed piece in pale green nephrite with a thick, soft cord which appears to be bark-cloth, threaded through the suspension hole. Dimensions: length 69 mm.; width 9 mm.; thickness 4 mm. One of Parkinson's drawings (XIX), probably set in Tolaga Bay, dearly shows a man wearing one of these offset pendants from his ear with something which might be bark-cloth passed horizontally through the lobe. Parkinson shows at least ten other heads in his drawings all wearing ear-pendants, but in most the pendants are clearly straight. There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the bark-cloth; Cook and Banks record its growth in the Bay of Islands/?4) but this may well be one of the few surviving specimens of the true paper mulberry bark-cloth of the North Island. Unlike the comb, which came to be associated with long hair and ungodliness, greenstone ornaments retained their value in the era of missionary influence, though transferring from men to women, and they are found in many collections. Yet there is no satisfactory archaeological evidence for the antiquity of such greenstone ornaments. All that may be said is that, contrary to some views, greenstone was much in evidence as an ornamental material at the time of the earliest explorers, and there can be little doubt of its value and importance for decorative purposes in prehistoric times.

MUSIC The collection contains four different forms of wind instrument: a long wooden horn, a short wooden horn, a shell horn and a wooden flute. The term "horn" is used here to indicate a conically bored instru ment as against a cylindrically bored trumpet. This distinction is used nowadays for brass instruments(e6) and seems applicable to the ethno graphic field, though earlier New Zealand literature calls the first three "trumpets"/67) All four forms of instrument have previously been observed in collections and the flute has recently been the subject of a comprehensive study by Dr M. McLean/6 8) This work was not available at the time the present study was made, but an earlier publication by E. S. Dodge and E. T. Brewster on the "Acoustics of three Maori flutes"( 8 9) indicated that a purely typological analysis of the instruments would be inadequate and that they would be practically dead unless their musical capabilities were evaluated. The author was most fortunate in being able to obtain a report on the three horns by Dr J. Coles of the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge. Dr Coles' report has been written into the descriptions of the instruments. 22.435. PL III, fig. 19. Long wooden horn, conically bored with a relatively narrow, oval bell.

Both horns give the same notes and resemble each other in their rather flattened inner sections, and it may be suggested that the noise and appearance were more important than the precise pitches of the note. Decoration. The general shape of the bell clearly suggests the gaping mouth and flat triangular head of some animal. The bell is further decorated on its upper surface (fig. 35a) and sides of the mouth (fig. 35b) with finely executed, incised patterns based on the well-known Maori double spiral motif. The Maori name for such a pattern is pakura} which consists of opposed pairs of double spirals, lying between parallel ridges, alternated so that their outer rims join in a diagonal. The open spaces between spirals and lines are filled with visual ripples radiating from the central spirals. McEwan associates this style with the North Auckland carving area. 25.374. Pl.

Musical characteristics. These are affected in the present instrument by air leakage from a hole near the bell end and also from round the repaired area. The mouth tube ends in an inturned mouthpiece with rather sharp edges and the notes produced were g', f '. Discussion. Buck states that the Maori shell horn was made from triton shells; however, this is a genus type which is not found in New Zealand waters and the correct species appears to be the large trumpet shell (Charonia capax)Slz) These shellfish come into shallow water to breed during spring and are common from Tauranga northwards, growing to a size of 20 cm. The biological evidence was examined with the hope of localising a possible source or establishing the rarity of the shells. The distribution of the living shellfish indicates an originally northern source, though not really proving that the instrument was northern. The careful repair could be taken to suggest that the final locality was distant from sources of replacement and if purely musical taste were to be satisfied, the patch, however skilful, can scarcely have equalled the original qualities of the shell. But such an explanation does not allow for the possibility that an object took on a more than functional value. At the present day the repair of valued old objects is still practised: a close physical analogy lies in the way broken pieces of good china were riveted with lead in Victorian times, and the quite wide evidence for the way the ancient Maori repaired wooden and other articles by sewing patches to them. Yet one may suspect a motive even deeper, when the bell of a faulty musical instrument was repaired rather than replaced. The opinion is speculative, but as all the instruments are decorated with zoomorphic or anthropomorphic designs and when blown make a noise which is their own and not their blower's, they may have been treated as the embodiments of spirits.

In view of McLean's quantitative study of the instrument, it is worth establishing more dimensions for comparative purposes, but, as McLean has noted, there is some difficulty in deciding which end of the flute is the mouthpiece. It is assumed here that the narrower end and the one with the greatest distance from the final finger hole will be the blowing end: this distance is 3.2 cm., between first and second 2.0 cm, between second and third 1.5 and between third and end 2.4 cm. The diameter of the first hole was 4.5 mm. and the other two 5.0 mm. In overall size the present flute falls below the average length of 12.6 cm., for 19 speci mens recorded by McLean.

The mouthpiece is carved with a clearly intended anthro pomorphic face, based on the pakura style. The remainder of the design (Pl. I, fig. Id) is, however, much more obscure and, as far as the writer is aware, has not previously been described. It seems fair to say that it would not be immediately recognised as Maori. The pattern is based on elliptic, laurel leaf-shaped motifs, joining at the apices and filled with alternating plain and ladderlike ribbons. Supplementary to the main motif are several meanders which include some crude spirals. In an experimental copy of the flute the author found that the arcs could be created by means of a sharp edge, held hard against the surface of the tube while it was rotated by rolling. The laddering was more effectively achieved with a punch, rather than by chiselling. Musical characteristics. The flute is in excellent condition, but was not experimentally blown.

Piece of well-carved wood, consisting of a mask, from which there is a backwards extension carved with a bird-like manaia figure, perforated with mortices, and terminating in another, egg-shaped head. Dimensions: entire length 310 mm.; mask 124 by 78 mm. There is a shell inset for the right eye to the viewer, but the left is missing. The mouth is entirely hollowed out, and, throughout, the decorative carving employs a fairly deep and skilfully executed V groove for relief. Behind the mask there is a recessed slot, pierced by two mortices, possibly for binding or sockets for wood, though in what position it was intended to be held is not clear, for the object is carved all over except directly behind the mask.

A distinguishing feature of all carvings is the angle of the mask relative to the extension. At any rate, three separate specimens can be traced back to the Oldman collection, and the Cambridge one makes a fourth. This object is evidently one of a consistent type, but the explorers have not identified its use for us and even Parkinson, who illustrates an example, is not helpful. Such uncertainty has taxed ethnologists. Oldman says. The use of these objects is unknown to me. It has been suggested to me that they may be fishing-rod, hand-net handles, parrot snares or perches. The late Major-General Robley believed they were used in some way for thatching (?). No wearing caused by lashing or attachment is evident on either specimen/7 9) The observation of absence of wear is true for the Cambridge specimen. Of the suggested functions Duff has expressed a cautious opinion in favour of the parrot perch,(80) but would clearly be happier if a better alternative were raised. It must be admitted that there is some similarity between the examples under discussion and objects independently identi fied as "perch snares". Such a one is reproduced by Buck from Best,(81) from whom he also presumably derives much of the account of how they operated. In each case there is a mask, extension piece and small carved terminal head, but none of the pieces collected on the early voyages had shanks offset from the mask enabling them to be set up in the branches of a tree. Clearly they were intended to be attached to something, but whatever that was, it must have been substantial, judging by the size of the mortices or lashing holes. If the objects really were "perch snares" they would have been very inefficient devices for trapping birds as food, but would have caught them unharmed, so might have been used in frequently to obtain living specimens for taming or to act as decoys. It must be admitted that the illustrated examples appear to be virtually unworkable. With doubts raised about the snare function it may be asked whether a better explanation can be found. The unidentified objects look as if they fit to other, fairly stout timbers. Early illustrations show small wooden figures as fin?ais, sometimes standing on masks such as the present one, placed at the apex of the gable or "barge boards" on chief's or store houses. The most comprehensive range of drawings, though rather late, are those made by Augustus Earle in 1827-8.(82) It need not be expected that the surviving and more recent examples of Maori building would retain this device. Looking at later nineteenth century and early twentieth century buildings reproduced by W. J. Phillipps, it is clear that the mask has become more general, and has increased in size as the houses themselves enlarged and required extra support for 79. Oldman 1946:21. 80. Duff 1969:40. 81.

However, it should be emphasised that, as in so many ethnological questions, the burden of proof remains. THE QUESTION OF PROVENANCE WITHIN NEW ZEALAND Having completed the descriptions and discussion of the individual items the question arises of where along New Zealand's extensive coast line they may have been obtained. In 1769 it was considered sufficient that acquisitions were localised to New Zealand; at least no record has been associated with them of any more exact source. This is not a sur prising omission; to the collectors and museums of Europe, New Zealand would have been, and still may be, no more than a place on a map. Nor, for that matter, has localisation always been strictly pursued within the country itself until well into the twentieth century. Rather it was thought that whatever came from New Zealand must share distinguishable characteristics with equivalent objects from any other locality within the country, and that there had always been a single entity which may be called "Maori culture". But this situation is deceptive: just because there is a neatly defined geographical group of islands with a name it does not also follow that the abstraction "culture" spread throughout the whole area and acquired uniformity. Some uniformity is not denied but, perhaps strangely, the degree has not yet been defined, although as long ago as 1921 H. D. Skinner went some way towards achieving this in his proposal for "culture areas".(84) The purpose of this discussion is not, however, to start re-establishing culture areas, for the evidence here is inadequate. But already in the discussion of the individual items some steps have been taken towards closer localisation. Some of the carving styles appeared northern; the Charonia shells have a northern origin; some of the fish-hooks resemble those found in sites in the Thames district, while the lure-hook resembled finds in the South Island. Are there any records in the journals of the explorers which may indicate more exactly the areas from which the articles in the collection were obtained? A study of the journals of Cook, Banks and Parkinson does help to indicate a number of probable localities: these records are rarely specific and not always consistent. Mostly they use tantalising terms like "trifles" and "curiosities" and clearly the most frequent transactions were over food. But, in the sealed Additional Instructions issued to Captain Cook at the beginning of the voyage, the explorers were enjoined to observe the "Genius, Temper, Disposition and Number of the Natives, . . . and endeavour by all proper means to cultivate a Friendship and Alliance with them, making them presents of such Trifles as they may Value, inviting them to Traffick".(85) These instructions were obeyed and records duly kept of their fulfilment. 83.

The numbers and chief observations have next been transferred to the map, Pl. VII, fig. 37, to give a visual impression of the trading places and intensity of activity. Comments on the table. Out of a total of 135 days when the Endeavour was on the coast, there are 43 recorded upon which Maori goods were obtained. Of all these observations there are only three days when all journals coincide; Cook and Banks agree seven times, Banks and Parkinson eight times, but Cook and Parkinson only twice. Cook and Banks each made nine further, independent observations and Parkinson five. It is difficult to further evaluate the reliability of the separate observers : if they always agree one might suspect them of using a common source, while too much divergence might lead to the suspicion of hap hazard recording. One may at least surmise that Parkinson based some of his notes on those of his employer. It becomes clear, looking at the records, that Maori artefacts were not pouring in throughout the voyage. Of the 43 recorded days, 27 included direct references to food and at least 18 were specifically to food only. Furthermore, it looks as if very few artefacts were obtained from Queen Charlotte Sound, the only South Island landfall. The most obvious items from the Sound were pieces of human bodies, including the dried head obtained by Banks, though tactfully not mentioned by him. The surgeon, Mr Monkhouse, also seems to have collected some further human items when he inadvertently stumbled on a sacred place/8 e) What is more promising is the record by Banks of the wooden fish-hooks from Cape Palliser. One of these could well be the wooden lure hook No. 25.382. It is also possible to suggest a fairly close local isation for the paddles to the area of Poverty Bay (though hardly explaining the opportunity for such rapid assimilation of European technology as was indicated by the discussion). Weapons are recorded from Poverty Bay, Mercury Bay and the Firth of Thames, while clothing was obtained from a wider group of localities, starting with Poverty and Tolaga Bays, then Mercury Bay and the Firth of Thames, and ending with Doubtless Bay. But, as a safe generalisation it may be said that almost the entire collection must have been made from points along the East Coast of the North Island, between Poverty Bay, northwards to Doubtless Bay. CONCLUSIONS The purpose of this paper has been to make the Cambridge collection available to those concerned with Oceanic prehistory. The approach followed, and that in other recent work mentioned below, may give the superficial impression that ethnology is again becoming a fruitful subject after half a century of comparative neglect, but the explanation of this is not so simple. Although archaeology has been practised in New Zealand 86. Banks in Beaglehole 1963 1:458. 344</page><page sequence="42">WILFRED SHAWCROSS for many years there is still no doubt of the significance of Dr Roger Duff's definition of an early "Moa-hunter period", culturally distinguish able from immediately pre-European Maori culture as the early explorers found it in the late eighteenth century/8 7) At the time this concept was put forward the emphasis was, naturally enough, placed on establishing the range of the early assemblage, and it was not felt necessary to spell out the later one. This must have seemed, anyhow, well enough established in the ethnographic literature and glowing from the walls of museums. But, with the accelerated development of archaeology in the 1950s, the need for a more exact definition of the late phase became apparent/8 8) At this time Jack Golson went a considerable way towards settling the matter by gathering relevant evidence from ethnographic sources(89) and excavated collections, relatable to that time, notably material from the sites of Oruarangi, the Horowhenua area, and Murdering Beach, Otago.(90) Reading Golson now, it is obvious how he anticipated the present paper in his choice of early published sources and selection of material from early collections. Such an approach both reflects and requires an increased level of concern over sources, and it is interesting to observe how many other independent factors have led to this. It seems reasonable to believe that a most powerful influence has been the successive publication since 1955 of editions of the journals of Captain Cook and Joseph Banks by Professor J. C. Beaglehole. These, more than anything else, have made observations on the Maori at the time of first European contact, available to pre-historians. At the same time the ethnohistorical studies of Professors A. P. Vayda and B. G. Biggs/91) have revealed how these early sources may be used to re-examine ancient Maori institutions in the light of modern theories. In 1963 the late Dr Stig Ryden published his account of the collection of Oceanic artefacts made by Joseph Banks and now preserved in the Ethnographic Museum of Stockholm: the influence of this work as a model and source cannot be underestimated. Such a renewal of interest in early sources has led to the critical re-evaluation, notably by L. M. Groube, of more recent reconstructions of Maori institutions, settlement forms, and artefacts/92) It seems clear now that accounts of Maori culture in the great era of New Zealand ethnology in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, while strenuously trying to establish what was purely Maori, by excising obvious European introductions, were perhaps too close to the evidence to recognise other profoundly changed aspects after a century of acculturation. However, it would not be unfair to say that the recent perception of this trend has led to an over-compensated rejection of the applicability of nineteenth century observations to the late prehistoric. Indeed, a position has been reached where statements such as the following are made: "there is still no general answer to the problem of warfare; though some very sound suggestions have been 87.

It should be remembered that these are not "things" in isolation, but are the material products of human behaviour. Therefore it is legitimate, however difficult, to treat them as reflections of institutions and also logical to expect that the evidence of the nineteenth century will reveal the levels of their viabib'ty and adaptability to changed circumstances and, perhaps, their underlying causes. In short, the only reasons for not extending the present study of 36 Maori artefacts into a really comprehensive one are merely practical. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I wish to express my warmest thanks to Dr G. H. S. Bushneil, Director of the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. He encouraged this study in every way, assisted me in practical matters, and gave particularly valuable advice about the textiles. I also wish to include Miss Mary Cra'ster, curator of the museum, in my thanks for her kind help in making the collections accessible, and I wish to repeat my thanks to Dr John Coles, of the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthro pology at Cambridge, for his reports on the ranges of the musical instruments. I was able to work at the museum during sabbatical leave granted me by the University of Auckland in 1968, and I am happy to thank my old teacher, Mr E. S. Higgs and his wife for their hospitality during the period of study. I am grateful too to Mr P. Gathercole for supplying photographs of, and references to, the material in the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford. Lastly, I wish to acknowledge the generous assistance of the University of Auckland Archaeological Society in its donation towards the preparation of the blocks for the drawings. 93.

Note that Vayda 1960 and Biggs 1960 were also careful in pointing out how certain nineteenth century changes might affect the applicability of evidence from that era to the prehistoric. On the other hand, the persistence of many features well into the nineteenth century with very little, or no, noticeable alteration is a significant emergence from these studies.
