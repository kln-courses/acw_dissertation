Brown. Bactrian coins (fig. 6), probably the basis of Fuss man's suggestion noted above.11 A second likely source would be intaglios on gemstones or in gold. A number of such intaglios were found in the Tilya Tepe burials, and Pierfrancesco Cal lieri has recently published a catalogue of Seals and Sealings from the North-West of the Indian Subcontinent and Afghanistan (4th Century BC-llth Century AD): Local, Indian, Sasanian, Graeco-Persian, Sogdian, Roman, that shows the range and popularity of such objects across the area.12 I have found no intaglio from Northwest India that closely relates to the Tilya Tepe Bud dha type, although there are intaglios from the ancient world that do. Two examples are stone glyptics now in the Kunsthistorischen Museums in Vienna (figs. 7, 8). Both show naked male fig ures in similar bent poses, a very common body position for both male and female figures on the glyptics. Figure 7 depicts the nude hero Theseus lifting the stone off the sword and shoes his fa ther had placed under it. Figure 8 shows a simi larly positioned naked man reaching down to a dog. What interests me is the similarity to the Tilya Tepe figure in showing a nude male slightly bending to do a task with outstretched arms. The man in figure 8, while naked, has a cloak across his back that hangs down below his buttocks.13 I wonder if such a garment can explain the odd, but very heavily defined, tail-like form on the Tilya Tepe figure (compare figs. 8 and 4). There is no reason to doubt that glyptics similar to these two now in Vienna, both clearly West ern creations and dating from the fourth and third centuries b.c. respectively, might have been 79</page><page sequence="4">brown: The Walking Tilya Tepe Buddha Fig. 4.

While the Buddha had divested himself of his high caste and specifically of his royal and secular destiny, it was royal symbolism that the Indian artist adopted in his attempt to show the Buddha as a god. The depiction of Buddha as a god in artistic representations of his earthly and often very human life-scenes usually offered little problems; an exception, however, was the frequent walking episodes, as walking was inappropriate for gods and kings. Furthermore, it may be that the laksana of the "level tread" was interpreted as "flat-footed," which would have been an impediment to representing a walking Buddha. In a sense, therefore, I am proposing that the non-walking aspect of the Buddha may be seen as one of his visible royal attributes.23 Thus, both the Tilya Tepe and the Bimaran walking Buddhas, who are depicted as walking Fig. 8.

Photo: Kunsthistorisches Museum. rather than using conventions of walking, are highly exceptional, yet such images reappeared intermittently with rare examples in this same geographical area of the subcontinent. Certainly the most amazing reappearance of the walking Buddha is in the Kashmiri ivories of the eighth century when the walking Buddhas are placed as separate flanking figures in triads (fig. 10). The triad in the Kanoria Collection shows the central image a meditating Buddha surrounded by vari ous figurai types; what scene is being depicted is not clear. A second triad has been suggested by Stanislaw Czuma, who has put together objects from three U.S. museums: the flanking Buddhas are walking, while the central image depicts the Descent from Indra's Heaven (using, by the way, the convention of walking with the ladder sug gested).24 An even later example is the walking Buddha in the Nalagiri elephant scene on the Nepali painted manuscript cover dated to 1054 in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.25 There is, however, a second reverberation of the Tilya Tepe imagery that is found in Gan dharan art, which is the very notion that the Buddha pushes along the ground the Wheel of the Dharma. At Sarnath, the Buddha gave his First Sermon and with it the Wheel of the Law began to turn. The turning of the Wheel, one of 83</page><page sequence="8">brown: The Walking Tilya Tepe Buddha }A il ί κΨ)\1 W !W / :l|f! ■ Fjif fcp —ι - ~· /V ' \i V - [ι hi) γΛ - ώ'1δ\ · ®p it ip 1 , vmilsl PI a :V Fig. 9.

For the Buddhists, the Wheel was moved, that is the teachings spread, for the first forty years of the faith by the Buddha himself, and then by the monks. The Buddha rolling the Wheel himself, as in the Tilya Tepe token, is an amazingly naive yet powerful image.

Its failure as a model for the Buddha as a naked, striding deity is a welcome insight into how the anthropomorphic Buddha icon developed, as we only have extant what ap pears to us as one full-blown and consistent icon ographical model that occurs without evidence of abandoned or rejected antecedents. Neverthe less, that the Tilya Tepe image type was not a unique example is shown by the continuation of two of its major characteristics, that of the walk ing stance and that of the action of pushing the Wheel, which are found only in the art of the Indian Northwest, Kashmir, and Nepal, and no where else in South Asia, for some one thousand years.

Particularly helpful is the listing, including small illustrations, of the dated Mathura and Gandhara im ages as an appendix to Stanislaw J. Czuma's catalogue, Kushan Sculpture: Images from Early India (Cleve land, 1986), pp. 227-31, that includes a number of Bud dha and Jina images. With the discovery in 1993 of the Rabatak Inscription of Kaniska I, the debate regarding the dates for Kaniska's reign, and thus of the dated im ages from his and the reigns of other Kushan kings, has taken a welcome turn toward solution, foe Cribb sug gests a beginning date for Kaniska's reign between a.d. 107 and 120: "The Early Kushan Kings: New Evidence for Chronology," in Coins, Art, and Chronology: Es says on the Pre-Islamic History of the Indo-Iranian Borderlands, ed.

Van Lohuizen-de Leeuw argues that marks indi cating hair began to be made on Mathura images with the hair knot under influence of the wavy hair types of Gandharan images. She discusses the development in The "Scythian" Period, pp. 162-68 and 206-15. 5. Mrs. Murial Mustamandy, who unfortunately passed away last year, had been told several times by the Taliban that the Tilya Tepe finds, many of which are in gold, were safely kept in the Kabul Museum even during the years of fighting and unrest. I do not think that this was ever confirmed, but if this material was in the Museum, it is most likely lost today. 6. G.

Fussman suggests the last quarter of the first century b.c. (Fussman, "Monnaie d'or de Kaniska," p. 169b). Evgeny V.
