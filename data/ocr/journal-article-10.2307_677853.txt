This is the first of three pathbreaking volumes that will constitute a wide-ranging analytical guide to the world's approximately 5,000 languages. Written for both general readers and linguists, the present work offers the only exhaustive, up-to- date classification of the world's languages and the first worldwide account of the history of linguistic classification. The author out- lines the basic principles of genetic (evolutionary) classification, discusses the history and present status of genetic classification in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, and North and South America, and presents a complete genetic classification of the world's languages in terms of 17 major language families and thousands of subgroupings. $45.00 Language in the Americas Joseph H. Greenberg. Challenging the conventional view that there are several dozen or even several hundred historically inde- pendent stocks of indigenous New World languages, this landmark of linguistic research asserts that there are only three: Amerind (comprising about 90 percent of the languages), Na-Dene, and Eskimo-Aleut. Most of the book is devoted to Amerind: eleven proposed subgroups with their languages and classification, some 1,900oo lexical etymologies common to two or more subgroups, some too grammatical features found across subgroups, the unity and bounds of Amerind, the methodology of classification, and the problem of Na-Dene. The final chapter considers the historical implications of the work for the settling of the Americas by three waves of Asiatic peoples. $45.00 Foundations of Cognitive Grammar VOLUME I: THEORETICAL PREREQUISITES Ronald W. Langacker. In what may be the most impressive re- thinking of linguistic theory since Chomsky, the author asserts that grammar is inherently a symbolic phenomenon, consisting in the structuring of conceptual content and the symbolization of the con- tent so structured. Part I sets out the philosophical origins, methodological assumptions, and basic concepts of cognitive grammar. Part II is a programmatic account of linguistic semantics, discussing the dimensions of conventional imagery, arguing for an encyclopedic view of meaning, and proposing cognitively grounded semantic characterizations of the noun and verb categories. Part III shows how a grammar formulated along these lines can work. $42.50 Stanford University Press STANFORD, CA 94305 533</page><page sequence="2">New from Cambridge- Making History Pukapukan and Anthropological Constructions of Knowledge Robert Borofsky "A very useful contribution..,. as well as a mine of information on the development and recent state of Pukapuka society." -Professor Sir Raymond Firth ". ..

BRADLEY Using both archaeological and historical documents, Bradley examines the Onon- daga Iroquois, the central nation of the Iroquois Confederacy, and the way their culture changed as a result of contact with Europeans. Bradley first traces the origins of the Onondaga. Emphasizing both settlement patterns and the evolution of distinctive ar- tifact forms, he follows the Onondaga through the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. He details first the introduction of, and then the steady increase in, Euro- pean goods. The focus is on how the Onon- daga incorporated these foreign materials into their own culture on a conceptual as well as a practical level. 288 pages, photos, maps, Cloth $24.95 figures &amp; tables, index ' ?~;'??;rSc~ :tc;r' ?? iTI? i ;C7~~ F?)i; ~i? r r'r? .. ,? r v r, u ?1? ?? ?? .??

It will stand as a very important contribution to anthropology, ethnohistory, Latin American studies, and women's studies'." -Kay B. Warren, Princeton University &amp; A &amp; Moon, Sun, and Witches Gender Ideologies and Class in Inca Colonial Peru Irene Silverblatt C ~5 When the Spanish arrived in Peru in 1532, men of the Inca Empire worshipped the Sun as Father and their dead kings as ancestor heroes, while women venerated the Moon and her daughters, the Inca queens, as founders of female dynasties. In the pre- Inca period such notions of parallel descent were expressions of complementarity between men and women. Examining the interplay between gender ideologies and political hierarchy, Irene Silverblatt shows how Inca rulers used their Sun and Moon traditions as methods of controlling women and the Andean peoples the Incas conquered. She then explores the process by which the Spaniards employed European male and female imageries to establish their own rule in Peru and to make new inroads on the power of native women, particularly poor peasant women.
