Published by Abbeville Press, New York, 1989. 144 pp. 128 illustrations, 48 in color. $39.95 "Minimalism," like most terms used to describe tendencies in art during a given per iod, has settled into common usage even though most artists reject it and historians find it problematic. Kenneth Baker's gener ously illustrated book, Minimalism: The Art oj Circumstance, is the first to appear on the sub ject since Gregory Battcock's 1968 anthol ogy. Its appearance is timely. Minimalism is "in the air," as evidenced by the strong influ ence it has exerted on current art: and the increasing number of exhibitions and writ ings on Minimalism that have appeared recently. Unfortunately, Baker's book, with its enticing packaging, does not deliver the in-depth study that the subject requires. It presents a confusing definition of Minimal ism that is both too narrow and too broad: it restricts its focus to major New York sculp tors, and it expands Minimalism to include Post-Minimalism. Baker says he will approach Minimalism as a historical moment rather than an artistic style, but he never settles upon its timeframe nor does he examine the circumstances of its evolution or its historical roots. He argues that Minimal ism's most important innovations are its rejection of anthropomorphism and its revi sion of Cartesian psychology. But while these issues are elaborated upon, others cen tral to Minimalism are missing or only men tioned in passing. Underlying the entire study is a polemic about the art business and a repeated analysis of Minimalism in terms of its ability or inability to transcend its sta tus as a commodity. This argument fails to tell us anything unique about Minimalism and as a result provides no valid critique. Baker establishes initially that he will focus on New York art, primarily sculpture made after 1960, and he offers two implica tions of the term "Minimalist" when ap plied to the visual arts. One is a description of the most commonly held idea of what Minimal art looks like: "abstract... and barren of merely decorative detail, in which geometry is emphasized and expressive tech nique avoided." The other is the idea that Minimalism presents as art "things that are—or were when first exhibited—indistin guishable (or all but) from raw materials or found objects." While the "non-art" aspect of Minimalism was integral to how much of it was originally experienced, it is too wide spread an aspect of 1960s art to be used as one of two main criteria defining Minimal ism, and results in some of the confusion as to what Baker means by the term. At first Baker calls the historical moment of Minimalism "a brief outbreak of critical thought and invention in the cavalcade of postwar American art." This suggests that he will focus on the period from the early to mid-1960s, when Minimalism emerged, along with Pop Art, as the dominant style in U.S. art. But elsewhere in the book, the time and location of Minimalism expands to include "everything from the early sculp tures of Donald Judd and Tony Smith to early and recent deployments of materials and processes by Tony Cragg, Meg Webster, Wolfgang Laib, and the Italians identified with Arte Povera." This leaves the reader unsure whether Minimalism is a short-lived historical moment that Baker will examine as such or a movement that has not yet ended. Likewise, whether he thinks of Mini malism as a New York or an international phenomenon remains unsettled. While he briefly discusses the work of Joseph Beuys and Michelangelo Pistoletto, there is no attempt to reassess 1960s art history by deal ing with Minimalism's international scope. Baker's argument for not including paint ers is that they "did not take abstraction to a point where it made their works unrecogniz able as paintings, at least not during the 1960s." However, one could argue the same for most sculpture that Baker includes. To the informed art viewer Judd's metal boxes or even Carl Andre's configurations of fire bricks would have seemed no less like sculp ture than Ellsworth Kelly's primary color panels or Agnes Martin's grids would have seemed like paintings. At the time, painting and sculpture alike seemed equally auda cious in their radical reductivism and dealt with many of the same formal and philo sophical issues. The fact that Baker devotes the first chapter of his chronological survey to Frank Stella's early paintings, because he sees them as setting the tone for Minimal ism, undermines his argument that painting does not fit. Baker's presentation of sculpture is in itself problematic, first because of the almost exclusive focus on major New York male sculptors; and second, because of the way Minimalism and Post-Minimalism are pre sented as a seamless whole. The artists who emerge as the major figures of Minimalism are Stella, Andre, Judd, Robert Morris, Robert Smithson, and Richard Serra. Tony Smith, Sol LeWitt, Dan Flavin, and Joel Shapiro receive somewhat less coverage, but their status is acknowledged by the relatively lengthy discussion of their work. (LeWitt and Flavin are not given enough credit as central contributors to Minimalist sculp ture; Baker even argues, unconvincingly, that LeWitt's sculptures really don't qualify as Minimalist.) Walter De Maria is credited with producing the single great masterpiece of Minimalism, his Lightning Field (1971-77), which merits a lengthy discussion in the book's last chapter. Others, Bruce Nauman, Eva Hesse, Jackie Winsor, Barry Le Va, and Mel Bochner come across as less central to Baker's concept of Minimalism. Hesse and Winsor are the only two women included, and Baker's presentation marginalizes the significance of them and the contributions of other women to sculpture. Baker's choice of this roster of artists lim its his analysis of Minimalist sculpture and what evolved from it.

Minimalism's weak ness is "its failure to seal itself or its meaning against erosion by circumstances that were certain to change." But this could just as well be true of any art. Finally, this argument tells us nothing about Minimalism, but rather about Baker's own attitude toward art and the artworld. If Baker's real interest is in the status of art as a commodity in the art system, then his book would have contrib uted to our understanding of Minimalism had he presented a well-researched analysis of the roles artists, curators, dealers, collec tors, and critics (including himself) played in promoting and explaining Minimalism. Because he fails to do this, Baker's critique does not help reevaluate Minimalism or answer the problematic issues about contem porary art that some of it raises.
