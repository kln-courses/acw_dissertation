BERNARD KNAPP Abstract Ancient cultural encounters in the Mediterranean were conditioned by everything from barter and exchange through migration and military engagement to coloni zation and conquest. Within the Mediterranean, island relations with overseas polities were also affected by fac tors such as insularity and connectivity. In this study, we reconsider earlier interpretations of cultural and social interactions on Cyprus at the end of the Late Bronze Age and beginning of the Iron Age, between ca. 1200 and 1000 B.C.E. Examining a wide range of material evidence (pot tery, metalwork, ivory, architecture, coroplastic art), we revisit notions (the "colonization narrative") of a major migration of Aegean peoples to Cyprus during that time. We argue that the material culture of 12th-llth-century B.C.E. Cyprus reflects an amalgamation of Cypriot, Aege an, and even Levantine trends and, along with new mortu ary traditions, may be seen as representative of a new elite identity emerging on Cyprus at this time. Neither colonists nor conquerors, these newcomers to Cyprus?alongside indigenous Cypriots?established new social identities as a result of cultural encounters and mixings here defined as aspects of hybridization.* INTRODUCTION The "great historical inscription" of Ramesses III of fers a simplified, propaganda-driven view of encounters between the Sea Peoples (Peleset, Tjeker, Shekelesh, Denyen, Weshesh) and the Bronze Age kingdoms of Cyprus (Alashiya), Anatolia (Hatti, Arzawa), and north Syria (Qodi).1 Did these Sea Peoples ever constitute a unified force? How widespread were their move ments? Were their actions any different from those carried out in previous centuries by groups such as the Lukki, the Sherden (reign of Amenophis III, 14th century B.C.E.), or Madduwatta and the Ahhijawa? In our view, the diverse groups known as the Sea Peoples never united with a collective purpose, nor did they precipitate the collapse of the economic, artistic, and ideological system (s) that linked so many Bronze Age polities throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediter ranean. Instead, they too suffered from the gradual disintegration of so many wealthy, closely interlinked Late Bronze Age states and kingdoms. In this study, we reconsider the proposed move ments of people from the Aegean region, some of whom?like the Sea Peoples?were certainly migrants fleeing from the unsettled conditions of their home land at the end of the Late Bronze Age. We begin by outlining our approach and discussing briefly the archaeological background to the situation on Cy prus during the Late Bronze Age, particularly its last phases in the 12th century B.C.E. We then discuss in some detail a multitude of continuities and changes in material and social practices during the centuries be tween ca. 1200 and 1000 B.C.E. Basing our arguments on the Cypriot archaeological record, we reassess the proposed migration of Aegean colonists to Cyprus in terms of the two prevailing views: (1) the "colonization narrative" and (2) the "mercantile perspective." In particular, we consider how these metanarratives have been established with reference to the archaeological record. Viewing some of the same materials?pottery, architecture, metalwork, ivories, coroplastic art?from a postcolonial perspective centered on the concept of hybridization, we propose an alternative understand ing of the migratory events that characterized the end * This manuscript is a collaborative and extensive rework ing of an earlier study, "Cyprus at the End of the Bronze Age: Material Culture, Ethnicity, Migration and Hybridisation," written by Voskos for the M.Phil. degree in the program in Mediterranean Archaeology at the University of Glasgow in 2004/2005.

BERNARD KNAPP [AJA 112 of the Late Bronze Age on Cyprus, themselves embed ded in social and economic transactions that had been underway for at least 200 years. BACKGROUND AND APPROACH Despite the breadth and intensity of fieldwork and research carried out on Cyprus since the mid 19th century, many periods?in particular transitional pe riods?remain the focus of debate.2 One of the bet ter studied but still most controversial periods is the transition between the end of the Late Bronze Age (Late Cypriot [LC] IIC-IIIA) and the Early Iron Age (LC IIIB-Cypro-Geometric [CG] I), between ca. 1300 and 1000 B.C.E. Scholars have long argued that Cy prus had been colonized during these crucial years by Mycenaeans (or "Achaeans") after the widespread col lapse of Late Bronze Age polities and trading networks throughout the eastern Mediterranean.3 Any attempt to evoke the social aspects of a time during which intensive meetings, mixings, and interac tions of different peoples took place invariably involves several classes of archaeological material, which in turn elicit diverse interpretations. In the case of Cyprus, many such interpretations remain firmly focused on descriptive approaches to the material record or on literary-mythological allusions. Newer attempts at inter pretation call upon concepts such as materiality, social identity, migration, and hybridization, all of which have singular importance for understanding the critical pe riod between ca. 1300 and 1000 B.C.E. on Cyprus. Unlike the Forum Article by Iacovou,4 in this study we do not hesitate to engage with concepts stemming from work elsewhere in archaeology and anthropol ogy. Indeed, we believe this is crucial to supplement the kind of literary-based, macrohistorical approach espoused by Iacovou. Here, and in several other recent articles that aim for a more "balanced" view of Iron Age Cyprus, Iacovou emphasizes that "the information supplied by the surviving literary evidence is far less im portant and should be viewed as less reliable than that extracted from evidence collected via archaeological methods, for example, inscriptions, especially those issued by eponymous state leaders."5 In her Forum Article, Iacovou focuses on such inscriptional (and literary) evidence, leaving aside most of the archaeo logical evidence we discuss in this paper. The theme that underpins her paper in this Forum, and several others, is the superiority of the incoming Greek-speak ing migrants over the native Cypriot population, an approach that not only accommodates the Helleniza tion perspective so widely criticized in Mediterranean archaeology but actually advocates it.6 This notion of an Aegean (or "Achaean" or Myce naean) migration to or colonization of Cyprus during the 12th century B.C.E. is deeply ingrained in Cypriot archaeology.7 Most scholars involved employ the terms "migration" and "colonization" as though they had the same meaning.8 Colonization, however, usually refers to "the act of establishing colonies,"9 a notion heavily influenced by ancient as well as modern conceptions. Ancient Greeks used the term "apoikiai" (a7toiidou), which means "away from home," while modern Europe an nations tend to use colonization in the sense of Latin colonia, meaning "settlement deliberately established elsewhere."10 In the latter sense, colonization typically involves manipulation or domination by the coloniz ers and submission or resistance by the colonized. Any cultural analysis that invokes the concept of coloniza tion depends on what scholars intend to emphasize by using that term: is it the foundation of settlements in alien lands or the sociopolitical and economic aspects of domination over local people? Migration is a completely separate but equally com plex issue. From a construetivist perspective, migration is seen as "a behavior that is typically performed by de fined subgroups with specific goals, targeted on known destinations and likely to use familiar routes" and "as a process that tends to develop in a broadly predictable manner."11 The current significance attached to migra tion may be linked to postmodern and postcolonial approaches that aim to empower indigenous peoples at the expense of imperial or colonial regimes. Migra tion, of course, will not be applicable in every historic or prehistoric context.12 Moreover, before it becomes a useful tool for archaeological interpretation, migra tion must be recognizable materially as patterned be havior, and archaeologists must realize that there are many different types of migration. Postcolonial studies increasingly play a key role in social archaeology, not least in reaction to one-sided 2 E.g., on the Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age transition, see Webb and Frankel 1999; Frankel 2000; cf.

As employed in post colonial and cultural studies, hybridization refers to the social interactions and negotiations that take place between colonists and the colonized, that is, the pro cesses that lay behind the "cultural mixture [that] is the effect of the practice of mixed origins."16 Hybrid ization neither presupposes the dominance of colonial cultures over indigenous ones nor maintains any socio cultural divisions. All groups engaged in such entangle ments contribute to the shaping of hybridized cultures through interaction and negotiation. The outcome of the colonial encounter is a totally new social situation forged by diverse customs, traditions, and values. A new sociocultural identity is also created through a wide range of behaviors, differences, exclusions, and choices of self-representation between these groups.17 All indigenous societies already had at the moment of contact with colonizers "complex and dynamic his tories that were very much in motion."18 Any analysis that perceives power relations as one-sided and central to social exchange misconstrues such relations, which seldom entailed the subordination of natives, unequal exchange partners, or socially less complex groups.19 In archaeological cases, careful consideration of the products and outcomes of colonial encounters results in quite a different picture. By focusing on how hy bridization works and is given material expression, it becomes possible to analyze and understand better the mechanisms by which innovations were adopted and adapted to prevailing material and social practices, how their mixing?while drawing on locally available materials?led to entirely new forms and meanings of the objects involved. For those who realize that peoples and cultures are perpetually engaged in a conversation with other cul tures and peoples, and that all cultural products are parts of such a conversation, the concept of hybridiza tion may seem to offer little beyond a language with dubious overtones from plant breeding. Archaeology, however, offers important insights into colonial situa tions and culturally mixed societies. The outcome of hybridization practices may be imprinted in a wide range of material culture.20 The ambivalence and am biguity that characterize many contact situations result from constant negotiations over the differences and similarities between the distinctive groups involved. Such ambiguity is an inherent feature of colonialism and should not be seen as an exclusively modern or Western phenomenon.21 Hybridization, therefore, is just as likely to have occurred in ancient contact and colonizing situations as in modern ones.22 All these issues must be kept in mind when we at tempt to analyze the situation on Cyprus between the 13th and 11th centuries B.C.E. In our opinion, coloni zation and colonialism alike have been misrepresented by many archaeologists working in Cypriot prehistory and protohistory. Merrillees long ago criticized their obsession with widely adopted ideas such as "pots equal people" and what he termed the "invasion syndrome" in Cypriot historiography.23 Despite the fact that many more archaeologists now focus on internal processes in attempting to define social change, there is still a tendency to regard Cyprus as a bridge between supe rior cultures and to see Cypriot culture as a continu ous reflection of those in surrounding regions. Those who support the notion of a Mycenaean colonization also tend to adopt and embrace the Hellenization per spective, which assumes that high culture, like water, flows downhill.24 In such arguments, the superiority of Mycenaean culture, as well as its inevitable passive acceptance by native Cypriots, is taken for granted.25 In the case of Cyprus at the end of the Late Bronze Age, many archaeologists have constructed a crude "us vs. them" cultural division between Mycenaean colo nizers and local Cypriots. Such a division is already apparent, for example, in the much earlier work of Snodgrass, where settlers from the west are thought to have introduced a system of warlike monarchies that evolved into the city-kingdoms of the Cypro-Ar chaic period.26 It continues, somewhat less divisively, in the accompanying paper of Iacovou, where a power 13Dietler 1998, 295-98; 2005, 55-61; Keay and Terrenato 2001. 14 van Dommelen 2005,117. 15 Lyons 1996,177; Dieder 2005,54. 16Friedmanl995,84. 17van Dommelen 2005,117-18,136. 18 Dieder 1998, 289. 19Thomas 1991,83-4. 20van Dommelen 2005,118. 21 van Dommelen 2002,2006. 22Rowlandsl994. 23Merrilleesl975,37. 24Dietler 1998,295-96; 2005,56-7. 25 For a similar critical view, see Bikai 1994, 35. 26Snodgrass 1988,12.

BERNARD KNAPP [AJA 112 struggle for state authority is seen to have begun in the 11th century B.C.E., fomented by the heirs of the Greek-speaking basileis who migrated to Cyprus and who, with specialist craftsmen under their wing, rein vigorated the island's metals industry.27 Thus, it took Aegean migrants little more than a generation to gain the upper hand, politically and culturally, over the lo cal inhabitants. By the seventh century B.C.E., these same migrants are said to have laid claim successfully to land, power, and state authority on Cyprus. Such one-sided views stem in part from the modern historical situation on Cyprus. Cypriot archaeology emerged as a distinctive discipline when the island came under British colonial administration at the end of the 19th century. Not only were British archaeolo gists influenced by the then-dominant antiquarian ap proach, but British colonists also had many reasons to support a deep-time connection between Cyprus and Greece, not least because the Ottoman empire still "owned" the island.28 Indeed, the tendency to con nect ancient colonialism with modern situations was common practice for many contemporary European colonizers who sought to justify their presence in for eign territories by presenting themselves as the suc cessors of ancient Greek or Roman colonists.29 And from the first decades of the 20th century up to at least 1960, many Greek-speaking Cypriots embraced the concept of an Aegean colonization to support their stand against the British, particularly in their demand for enosis ("unification") with Greece. Those who support an Aegean colonization of Cy prus naturally emphasize the Aegean aspects of the island's post-13th-century B.C.E. material culture. Al though the movement of Greek-speaking peoples to Cyprus at some point toward the end of the second millennium B.C.E. is hard to deny, virtually all argu ments supporting this movement have failed to con sider the wider implications of using concepts such as acculturation, migration, and colonization. The Fo rum Article by Iacovou represents well this approach. What remains elusive is a nuanced understanding of what actually took place on Cyprus at the end of the Late Bronze Age: colonization, or migration and hy bridization? Which is better supported by the actual archaeological data? Given the mutability of ethnic ity or an ethnic identity, is it even possible to identify the intrusive groups as "Mycenaean"? What about the identity, ethnic or otherwise, of the offspring of inter marriage between Aegean and Cypriot people? Which material aspects might form the boundaries and mark ers of distinction between newly arrived and indigenous ethnic or social groups? How can they be recognized? Such questions underscore the problematic character of prevailing interpretations. Nearly 40 years ago, based on his seminal fieldwork with Afghani nomadic groups, Barth argued that ethnic identity should not be analyzed in terms of dress, food, language, blood, or culture but rather with respect to the spatial, notional, and ideological limits of these fea tures.30 Indeed, no single factor can be equated directly with ethnicity?neither biology or physical difference nor technology nor material culture, not even culture and language. Iacovou, however, takes it for granted that linguistic identity is a secure marker of ethnicity. In her view, the survival of the Greek language and its ulti mate preponderance over an unknown local language in the centuries after ca. 1100 B.C.E. is concomitant with the political predominance of Greek speakers? an interpretation she seeks to prove by calling upon epigraphic data and Greek literature, including my thology, of the following six-seven centuries. That the Greek language survived and became predominant in Cyprus during the first millennium B.C.E. has nothing to do with a political takeover of the island by Greek speakers. If we were to adopt such a linguistic-based perspective to assess the predominance of the Ottoman empire, for example, how would we explain ethnically Muslim Greek speakers or ethnically Christian Ortho dox Turkish speakers? The inhabitants of the Ottoman empire expressed their identity through their religion, not their language. In this study, we seek to demonstrate that by adopt ing certain crucial aspects of postcolonial theory, in particular the concept of hybridization, we stand to gain a much clearer understanding of the situation on Late Bronze-Early Iron Age Cyprus than we would by adopting Iacovou's long-term perspective rooted in much later inscriptions, literature, and myth. We ar gue that what happened on Cyprus during the crucial centuries between ca. 1200 and 1000 B.C.E. has little to do with an outright colonization of the island, no matter what terms are applied. Before turning to these matters, however, we discuss briefly the internal situ ation on Cyprus during the two centuries preceding the end of the Bronze Age. We believe the meetings and mixings that took place between local Cypriots, Aegean, and Levantine peoples during these 200 years shed crucial light on what followed. One could argue, along with Iacovou, that we must also look forward, to the centuries after 1000 B.C.E., to 27 Iacovou 2008; see also 2006b. 28 Given 1998. 29Mattingly 1996, 50; van Dommelen 2002, 122; Dietler 2005,42. 30Barth 1969.</page><page sequence="5">2008] CYPRUS AT THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE 663 understand what happened during the Late Bronze Early Iron Age transition. But that would form the subject of another study entirely, one constrained in many respects by the predominantly mortuary record of the Cypro-Geometric period. In any case, Iacovou demonstrates well in her study the importance of engaging with epigraphic and other evidence from these later centuries if we wish to gain a fuller picture of the Late Bronze-Iron Age transition. Our studies, whatever their divergent perspectives, agree on several crucial points: (1) the considerable material continu ities between LCIIIA and HIB; (2) the migration of an indeterminate number of Aegean people to Cyprus; (3) the difficulties in tracing the material expression of this migration on Cyprus; and (4) the initial, peaceful symbiosis between these people and the local Cypriots. Where we part company is her interpretation of the epigraphic and literary data of the following centuries to mean that much of Cyprus' territory, economy, and culture were controlled by Greek-speaking ex-Myce naean basileis and their followers. THE LATE BRONZE AGE! MATERIAL CULTURE AND SOCIAL PRACTICES Before Middle Cypriot (MC) III-LC I, beginning ca. 1650 B.C.E. (table 1), only a moderate amount of ma terial evidence demonstrates any sort of sustained con tacts between Cyprus and the surrounding regions.31 Thereafter, the discovery of numerous foreign goods in early levels at Enkomi and in LC I mortuary depos its (mainly in north and northwest Cyprus?e.g., at Morphou-Toumba tou Skourou and Ayia Irini-Palaeo kastro; fig. I)32 represent the first signs of intensifying economic activities that promoted and necessitated overseas contacts.33 Several factors lay behind the ini tiation and enhancement of these foreign contacts: (1) the involvement of emergent elites in the international trading system (s) that operated in the eastern Mediter ranean; (2) Cyprus' strategic position within the wider Mediterranean; and above all (3) the rich copper ore deposits in the island's Troodos massif. At Enkomi, remarkable mortuary deposits repre sent wealthy social groups who were able not only to acquire precious luxury and exotic goods (gold jew elry, various artifacts made of silver, copper, faience, ivory) but also to remove them from circulation.34 Such goods served to establish symbolic links with overseas powers and played a transformative role in developing local ideologies of prestige and new social hierarchies based on the control of copper production and trade.35 People of diverse social and geographic origins?lo cal and foreign?resided in the island's coastal towns, which helped to mark out their international, cosmo politan character. One material witness to this situa tion is a silver bowl from Hala Sultan Tekke bearing an Ugaritic cuneiform inscription translated as '"Aky, son of Ykhd, made [this] bowl." 'Aky is a Hurrian name, and Ykhd is Semitic.36 Stylistic analyses of other items excavated in these town sites and dated to LC II reveal a mixture of lo cal, Levantine, Egyptian, and Aegean elements, early indicators of hybridization practices that became much more intensified during the 12th-llth centu ries B.C.E.37 Here, as examples, we mention only a couple of well-known objects, such as the inlaid gold and niello silver bowl from Enkomi dated to the 14th century B.C.E. (fig. 2).38 The ornate bulls' heads and flowers that decorate this object, as well as its produc tion technique, are regarded as Aegean in derivation.39 Its shape, however, is typically Cypriot, with strong roots in the traditional wishbone-handled White Slip Ware milk bowl. Another object worth noting is a gold necklace from Ayios Iakovos, also dated to the 14th century B.C.E.40 The pomegranate-shaped beads are regarded as being of Aegean type, whereas the pendant is deemed "oriental."41 Another good example can be seen in the female figurines dated mainly to LC II, during the 15th-14th centuries B.C.E. (e.g., fig. 3).42 Both Merrillees and Karageorghis have cited their wide distribution on the island to argue for a Cypriot origin.43 Nonetheless, they are typically dubbed "Astarte" figurines because they reveal strong iconographic and stylistic affinities with Levantine examples.44 Budin argues that they were modeled on figurines from the Orontes region in northern Syria, dated to the mid second millennium 31 Knapp 1994,409-24; 2008,74-81. 32 In this paper, for hyphenated Cypriot place names, the first name is that of the nearest village/town and the second name is that of the site or locality (nearest the actual site) as in dicated on cadastral maps of Cyprus. 33Pecorella 1977,21, fig. 30a, b; 26, fig. 44a, b; 113, fig. 269; Vermeule and Wolsky 1990, 381-83, figs. 167-74; Keswani 2004,84,125. 34 Keswani 2004,126-27; 2007,520-24. 35 Keswani 2004,136. 36?str?m and Masson 1982. 37 E.g., on seals: Keswani 2004,136; in jewelry: Maxwell-Hys lop 1971,107,112-31; Lagarce and Lagarce 1986,109-17;Kes wani 2004,138. 38French Tomb 2 (Schaeffer 1952, 379-80, pi. 116). 39Karageorghis 1982, 80. 40 Swedish excavations (P.

In sum, during LC I-IIC (early), craftspeople and consumers produced and used a range of objects that exhibit clear signs of fusion?early examples of hybrid ization practices. At this point, we simply emphasize that these objects should be seen in the context of Cy priot culture and with respect to the social practices of diverse local Cypriot groups. Moreover, even though such practices were still active?and became much more intense?in the 13th-l 1th centuries B.C.E., most archaeologists studying that period invoke intrusive peoples and external influences when they attempt to interpret these hybrid objects. Late Cypriot IIC (Late)-Late Cypriot III A The prosperous LC II period (ca. 1450-1250 B.C.E.) was followed by the LC IIC (late)?LC IIIA era (ca. 1250-1125 B.C.E.), during which the archaeological record throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediter ranean shows a series of site abandonments or de structions.47 Inscriptions and reliefs from the funerary temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu in Egypt at tribute these destructions to the Sea Peoples, although the precise period of their activities, the coherence of their attack on Egypt, and even the veracity of Ramess es' account remain the subjects of ongoing debate.48 Moreover, given the mutable character of ethnicity, it is doubtful if the names of these groups of people as they are known from Medinet Habu (Peleset, Tjeker, Shekelesh, Denyen, Weshesh) can in any way be taken to indicate an ethnic affiliation.49 Despite differing interpretations of the motivations and movements of the Sea Peoples,50 many scholars continue to link their appearance to the economic col lapse of the mercantile systems prevalent throughout the Late Bronze Age and the subsequent Aegean colo nization of Cyprus.51 During the "crisis years" at the end of the 13th century B.C.E., most palatial complexes in the Aegean and many town centers in the Levant were destroyed or ultimately abandoned, while the contem porary Hittite and Egyptian states went into terminal decline.52 On Cyprus, we find extensive evidence of site destructions and in some cases abandonment (e.g., at Maroni-Vournes, Morphou-Toumba tou Skourou, and Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios) ,53 Subsequently, how ever, several of the destroyed sites were rebuilt (e.g., Enkomi, Kition, Kouklia-Palaepaphos) and at the same time, the material culture within them reveals certain elements linked by many scholars to the Ae gean world. Overall, the late 13th century B.C.E. was an unstable time in which we see both striking conti nuities and an influx of new material and social prac tices. On Cyprus, however, the quality of life seems to have been maintained at a high standard within the town centers, and industrial activities continued at a significant level.54 45Budin 2003,140-44. 46Type Aii (Merrillees 1988; Karageorghis 1993, 3-10, pis. 1-7). 47 Karageorghis 1990, 7-26; Ward and Joukowsky 1992; Knapp 1997,54-5, table 2; Oren 2000. 48Lesko 1980; Muhly 1984, 39-41, 55; Cifola 1988; Liverani 1990,121. 49 Muhly 1984,40 n. 6; Sherratt 1998, 292-94. 50 E.g., various papers in Gitin et al. 1998; Oren 2000; Kil lebrew2005. 51 E.g., Karageorghis 1990, 29; Mazar 1991, 103; cf.

Ill Wares, in part following Late Helladic prototypes, made their appearance and quickly became the pre dominant pottery in use (at Enkomi, it makes up about 90% of the total assemblage in some contexts).59 Although Dikaios, the excavator of Enkomi, attrib uted all these changes to "Achaean" colonists, his views have not gone unchallenged.60 The best parallel for the town's grid plan seems to come not from the Aegean but from the Levant and may be noted particularly at Ras Ibn Hani, the coastal port of Ugarit.61 Given the exceptionally close relationship between Alashiya and Ugarit known from the documentary record,62 the Cypriots most likely adopted this element from the Levant.63 A comprehensive study of Cypriot architec ture also concluded that the widespread use of ashlar masonry on the island resulted from ongoing contacts with the Levant, notably with Ugarit.64 The prototypes of cyclopean fortification walls? an intrusive feature in Cypriot Bronze Age architec ture?have been traced to Anatolia, in particular to the fortified Hittite towns of Bogazk?y and Alishar.65 Karageorghis suggested that Mycenaean Greeks might have borrowed the technique through contacts with Miletus as early as the 14th century B.C.E.66 In Wright's view, the cyclopean walls and dog-leg gates uncovered at Maa-Palaeokastro and Lara recall constructions seen at Bogazk?y in Anatolia, Mycenae and Tiryns in Greece, and Shechem in the southern Levant.67 Rather than seeing such fortifications as a uniquely Aegean phenomenon, then, they should be regarded as rep resenting a broader, eastern Mediterranean tradition, perhaps another sign of the general upheaval and un rest associated with this period.68 Other architectural components seen at Enkomi, Kition, Alassa-Paliotaverna, Kouklia-Palaepaphos, and Maa-Palaeokastro?megaron-like halls, hearths, and bathrooms?have been argued to show strong Aegean associations.69 Karageorghis believes that hearths and bathtubs were part of the widespread material changes introduced into Cyprus by "newcomers from the west" during the transitional LCIIIA period.70 Based on the monumental structures excavated at Alassa-Paliotaver na, the excavator concluded that the megaron-like hall with freestanding hearth was a new architectural con cept "due to a migration from the West, most probably associated with the Sea Peoples."71 These large rooms with central hearths are widely believed to have served as places where elites gathered for feasting and associ ated activities;72 at Maa-Palaeokastro, they were found in context with large numbers of bones and pottery vessels suitable for consuming food and drink.73 The halls with central hearths found on Cyprus, however, 59Dikaios 1971,457-59; Kling 1989b, 165. ^Dikaios 1971,519. 61 Lagarce et al. 1987; Cadogan 1998,7. 62 Knapp 2008,318-23; see also Barako 2001,521. 63Negbi 2005,7. 64 Hull 1983. 65Furumark 1965,105,112; Dikaios 1971,910. ^Karageorghis 1990,28; see also Fortin 1978,67; 1981,553; Karageorghis and Demas 1988,63. 67Wright 1992,253. 68 Steel 2004a, 199. 09 Karageorghis and Demas 1988, 60-2; Hadjisawas and Hadjisawa 1997. 70 Karageorghis 1998; 2000,266-70. 71 Hadjisawas and Hadjisawa 1997,146-48. 72 See Fisher 2006. 73 Karageorghis and Demas 1988,60-1.</page><page sequence="9">2008] 667 Fig. 4.

Closely similar architectural units may also be found at several sites in the southern Levant and at Tarsus in Anatolia.74 In short, true My cenaean megara did not exist on Cyprus and cannot be regarded as material support even for an Aegean presence on the island, much less its colonization. Architectural Elements. Several architectural features said to be of "Aegean inspiration" are also linked to ideological aspects of LC IIIA society.75 These include horns of consecration found at Kition, Kouklia-Palae paphos, and Myrtou-Pigadhes, and stepped capitals found at Kition, Enkomi, Kouklia, Myrtou-Pigadhes, and Erimi-Pitharka.76 There are no secure Aegean parallels for the stepped capitals, which were prob ably integral to the construction of monumental ash lar buildings, themselves related to Levantine rather than Aegean architectural traditions.77 Webb also pointed out distinctive differences between the horns of consecration found on Cyprus and their Aegean counterparts: the Cypriot versions' horns have flat, square terminals, while those on the Aegean exam ples are more naturalistic and resemble actual bulls' horns. Steel has suggested that the depiction of bulls' horns in Cypriot ceremonial traditions can be traced back to the Early Cypriot period?for example, on the clay model said to be from Kotsiatis (fig. 5) and the "Vounous bowl."78 Finally, Webb discusses three Late Helladic (LH) IIIA-B kraters decorated with horns of consecration,79 which indicate that the symbolism as sociated with architectural horns of consecration had 74Karageorghis and Demas 1988, 60-2; Mazar 1991, 97-9, fig. 2. 75Karageorghis 2002a, 91. 76 Karageorghis 1990, 28; 2000, 261; Papadopoulos and Kontorli-Papadopoulou 1992; Papadopoulos 1997,176; Steel 2003-2004,100. 77Webb 1999,179-82. 78 Steel 2004a, 203-4. 79Webb 1999,176,178, fig. 68.</page><page sequence="10">668 IOANNIS VOSKOS AND A.

Pottery. The matter of locally made, Late Helladic influenced pottery is more complex. Various terms (Mycenaean IHClb, Late Mycenaean HIB, Rude Style, Decorated LC III, Levanto-Helladic) have been used to describe the wheelmade, matt-painted pottery that began to dominate Cypriot assemblages during LC IIIA. Because all these terms were applied to pottery wares with many overlapping features, most specialists now agree that, collectively, they should be termed White Painted Wheelmade III Ware.80 This realign ment and combination of formerly separate pottery types demonstrates that locally produced Late Hella dic-type wares found on Cyprus may be dated prior to the destructions at the end of the 13th century B.C.E.,81 about the same time such wares were being produced locally elsewhere in the Aegean and eastern Mediter ranean.82 The identification of these wares in several post-LC IIC destruction deposits (e.g., at Enkomi, Hala Sultan Tekke, Kouklia-Palaepaphos, Maa-Palaeo kastro, Alassa-Paliotaverna), however, has been used to argue that such deposits herald the arrival of Aegean colonists. Moreover, because a coarsely made pottery type known as Handmade Burnished Ware, previously known in the Aegean, appeared in LC IIIA contexts alongside these locally manufactured Late Helladic type wares (at Maa-Palaeokastro, Kition, Enkomi, Sinda, and Hala Sultan Tekke),83 it, too, has been at tributed to displaced Aegean settlers.84 Karageorghis later commented that this coarse ware "could not have been imported for its own beauty" and thus may have been introduced along with the arrival of a new eth nic group whose members used it to prepare certain kinds of food.85 Steel, however, usefully cautions that Handmade Burnished Ware, like all Late Helladic wares found on Cyprus, makes up only "a statistically insignificant percentage of the total LC ceramic rep ertoire" and thus should not be used to argue for an Aegean colonization of Cyprus.86 Kling also has argued against this colonization sce nario and the pottery-driven methodology used to es tablish it. She has discussed in detail the pottery types and decorative motifs that continued in use, as well as the gradual changes in White Painted Wheelmade III Wares that bear new Aegean and Levantine elements, such as the krater from Enkomi illustrated in figure 6.87 The Base Ring and White Slip Wares so typical of LC II gradually disappeared, but some new wheelmade pottery wares imitated these earlier handmade forms (e.g., Wheelmade Plain Ware carinated cups from En komi imitating canonical Base Ring II Ware forms) ,88 Bucchero and Plain White Wares continued to be pro duced but were now wheelmade.89 As already noted, however, the dominant ware in most LC IIIA contexts was White Painted Wheelmade III Ware, which made its first appearance before any Cypriot towns were de stroyed at the end of 13th century B.C.E.

Cyprus as "a hybrid style, combining Mycenaean, Minoan and Cypriot elements."92 Others refer to the "blending of local, Levantine and Aegean elements" apparent in these White Painted Wheelmade III Wares.93 More specifically, we find traditional Cypriot shapes (or Aegean vessel types already integrated in the local repertoire) decorated with foreign stylistic features. Kling discusses a low, hemispherical bowl with raised wishbone handle that is decorated with abstract Aegean-style designs.94 Some of the numer ous bell kraters?an Aegean shape integrated into the Cypriot ceramic tradition before the end of 13th cen tury B.C.E. and produced in the Rude Style?found at LC IIIA Enkomi were decorated with motifs deriv ing from the Aegean, the Levant, and Cyprus itself.95 An amphoroid krater from Kition is often assumed to represent an Aegean vessel type produced locally in Plain White Ware since the 14th century B.C.E.96 Krat ers of this type, however, already appear on Cyprus in LC I?II, in both White Painted Wheelmade I?II Ware and Proto-White Wheelmade I Ware before they are ever found in the Aegean.97 In the Levant, moreover, vessels of very similar shape and size go back to the Middle Bronze Age.98 The decoration on the Kition krater, arranged in panels, resembles some Levantine examples, but the individual motifs reveal influences from both the Aegean (the bird and a specific type of fish) and the Levant (butterfly ornament, fish in vertical row)." The end product, however, is purely Cypriot. There are also cases where earlier decorative ele ments were combined in new and creative ways.100 Kling, for example, describes a strainer jug from Kouklia with Aegean- or Levantine-style birds and Cy priot Rude (or Pastoral) Style bulls (fig. 7).101 These features combine some aspects of earlier Aegean pic torial traditions (birds of similar style are found on examples from Rhodes and the Greek mainland) with the predominant White Painted Wheelmade III Ware of the 12th century B.C.E.102 The prototype of the strainer jug, however, is problematic. Widely thought to be of Aegean origin, such vessels are rare in My cenaean pottery (excepting LH IIIC examples from the Dodecanese); they combine features of the Near Fig. 6. White Painted Wheelmade III Ware (early Pastoral Style) bell krater from Enkomi. Nicosia, Cyprus Museum, Swedish Tomb 9, no. 66 (courtesy Cyprus Museum). Eastern wine set (strainer and jug) in one vessel and are not uncommon in the Levant.103 The end result in the Kouklia jug, at least, is a new, distinctively Cypriot creation formed from old and new elements. At Alassa-Pano Mandilares, other strainer jugs are decorated with a range of Aegean-style motifs (spi rals, net patterns, geometric designs), while one of the shapes (tall, ovoid strainer jug) is unparalleled in Aegean-type wares on Cyprus and ultimately may have derived from the Levant.104 Commenting on Catling's (unpublished) description in her own study of the Kouklia strainer jug, Kling states that "it was produced during that period [LCIIIA] and displays a hybridiza tion of strains operating in Cypriot ceramics at that time."105 In our view, these vessels reveal the mixture or "in-betweeness" involved in many social interactions during this transitional period: they relate the material products in an active manner to those who made them and who embraced current cultural traditions. All the pottery examples cited above offer but a glimpse of the material practices that accompanied the complex hybridization processes that lasted throughout the 92Mountjoy 2005,209-10. 93 Kling 1989a, 175; see also Karageorghis 1977b, 197. 94 Kling 1989b, 164. 95 Kling 1991,182. 96 Karageorghis 1977b; Kling 1989b, 167. 97E.g., Sj?qvist 1940,56, fig. 14; 63, fig. 17. ^Yannai 2006,98-102; S.

Turning to metals and bronze artifacts, the LC IIIA period is also marked by the appearance of a new complex of warrior equipment whose origins have been traced to northern Europe.106 These new metal weapons include socketed spears, bronze greaves, and the Naue II type cut-and-thrust sword that had already appeared in the Aegean dur ing LH HIB (13th century B.C.E.) and thence perhaps came to Cyprus. A full set of this equipment (sword, greaves, and helmet) from the upper level of Tomb 18 at Enkomi has been interpreted as belonging to an Aegean warrior who had participated in the destruc tion of level IIB (end of LC IIC) at Enkomi.107 All this new weaponry, however, might just as well reflect a re sponse by Cypriot elite warriors to changing military tactics or the elite appropriation of exotic weaponry to enhance their military prowess symbolically.108 Another metal item often associated with the Aegean is the vio lin-bow fibula, examples of which have been found at Enkomi, Kition, and Maa-Palaeokastro.109 Thought to signal the use of a garment that had to be pinned to gether (for use in colder climates), these fibulas may have originated somewhere to the north of Greece. It was pointed out long ago, however, that they are also found in Italy as well as the Balkans and were not in common use in the Aegean before the 12th century B.C.E. (LH IIIC), about the same time they appeared in Cyprus.110 Pervasive foreign elements are evident in many 12th century B.C.E. Cypriot bronzes.111 Such elements are particularly noticeable in the four-sided bronze stands and the rod- or cast-tripod stands.112 On the four-sided stands, a wide range of subjects and themes?ingot bearers and lyre players, antithetic sphinxes, chariot scenes, bulls fighting with lions and griffins?engage and mix hybridized Aegean, Levantine, and Cypriot motifs.113 One well-known example is a wheeled bronze stand of unknown provenance, decorated with pairs of animals?bulls with lions and a bull with a griffin?in three vertical panels (fig. 8).114 The bull and lion may be Aegean in inspiration (seen in ivory carving), while the griffin is common in both Aegean and Levantine art, although only rarely seen in combat with a bull (e.g., on ivories from Byblos and Megiddo).115 It has now been demonstrated that the technology, typology, and design of most four-sided bronze stands were Cy priot in origin and had nothing to do with the Aegean bronze industry.116 Once again we see the creation of singularly Cypriot artifacts whose diverse stylistic and iconographical features reveal hybridization practices. In Cading's view, this was not the outcome of com mercial activity but rather the result of "the mobility of pardy destabilised individuals, families or communities whose interaction . . . produced that amalgam of Cy priot, Near Eastern and Aegean features that is so much easier to sense than to understand and explain."117 Hybridization practices are also evident in a number of bronze anthropomorphic figurines, most promi 106Desborough 1964,69-72; Muhly 1984,41-3. 107 Catling 1955; Dikaios 1969,1:406-8; Karageorghis 1990, 19. 108 Steel 2004a, 196. 109 Giesen 2001,40-55; Karageorghis 2002a, 93. ,10Desborough 1964,54-8. 111 Catling 1984,78; 1986,99. 1,2Catling 1964,192-211; Papasawas 2001. mSee, e.g., Karageorghis 2002a, 98-9, figs. 198-204. 114 Karageorghis 1979. 115 Karageorghis 1979,207 n. 10. 116 Karageorghis and Papasawas 2001,348,351; Papasawas 2001; see also Cading 1984,71. ,17Cadingl986,99.</page><page sequence="13">2008] CYPRUS AT THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE 671 Fig. 8.

The general ap pearance of the Horned God (facial features, body, kilt, greaves) is reminiscent of ivory specimens from both the Aegean and Cyprus, while its attitude has been linked to Near Eastern prototypes.119 Negbi feels that the Horned God displays the mixed inspirations of Syrian, Anatolian, and Aegean art but personifies a "local shepherd deity" that she regards as Cypro-Aege an in origin.120 Similarly, a fusion of Aegean and Near Eastern elements seems evident in the Ingot God's appearance. His pose has been likened to that of vari ous Levantine smiting figurines,121 but there are also elements of Aegean (greaves), Hittite (shield), and Sardinian (headgear) iconography.122 Although most scholars recognize this eclectic mix ture of stylistic elements in both figurines, often they assign origins based on their area of training and ex pertise or on the features they believe to be most sig nificant.123 Catling, for example, linked the Ingot God with the Greek divinity Hephaistos, while Dikaios ar gued that the Horned God was Mycenaean in origin, brought to Cyprus or produced there locally by My cenaean immigrants.124 Schaeffer, best known for his work at Ugarit in Syria, identified the Ingot God with the Semitic deity Resheph.125 Still others have equated the Horned God with local, mythic heroes (Kinyras) or gods.126 The equation of these figurines with divinities from the Aegean or the Levant ignores local agency and maintains the cultural division between local Cy priots and intrusive groups. Given all the other signs of continuity from LC IIC to IIIA and the mixture of sty listic elements visible in these statuettes, they should be regarded as Cypriot in origin and design.

BERNARD KNAPP [AJA 112 they reflect the ideological and cultural syncretism of Late Cypriot society;127 to our minds, they serve as two more examples of the hybridized material and social practices that characterize this era. Ivory. Ivory provides some striking cases of hybrid ized Aegean, Levantine, and local Cypriot elements. Two pyxis lids from Kouklia-Evreti, for example, are decorated in a mixed style characterized as "exhibiting Oriental as well as strong Mycenaean influences."128 On one of these lids, from Well TE III 165, and on a very fragmentary ivory plaque from Kition,129 a lion is represented attacking a bull, a motif well known from Minoan art and thought to be Aegean in origin.130 On the other Evreti lid, from Pit KD 137, a griffin depicted in front of a tree recalls Near Eastern prototypes. The same kind of mixture is observable on two ivory mir ror handles, one from Evreti (fig. 10) and the other from Enkomi.131 These objects depict armed warriors in Aegean-style kilts striking a recumbent lion (Evreti) and a griffin (Enkomi). The theme of warriors slaying real or mythical animals, it must be added, has a long tradition in Near Eastern art.132 Another ivory mirror handle from Swedish Tomb 19 at Enkomi was made in the form of a nude woman grasping her breasts,133 a concept that recalls works in both Egyptian and western Asian art.134 In technical and typological terms, this handle reveals Aegean inspira tion, while the design of the figure may derive from a Levantine school of carving. Overall, the composition may have been stimulated by Egyptian mirror handles that typically take the form of nude females.135 While this object represents another superb example of a hybrid product, with mixed influences deriving from diverse eastern Mediterranean sources, there is no rea son to believe it was manufactured outside Cyprus. Finally, on one of the long sides of an ivory gaming box from Enkomi, there is a hunting scene that de picts various horned and hoofed animals pursued by an archer in a chariot; a large bull with lowered horns faces the chariot.136 While the chariot scene is Near Eastern in inspiration, all the animals are depicted in flying gallop style, an Aegean motif. The bull and a small scene that depicts a hunter killing a lion may be compared with similar details on a gold bowl and gold plate from Ugarit.137 On a side panel, two bulls lie beneath a tree, in Aegean fashion.

During LCIIIA, the use of traditional rock-cut chamber tombs was largely replaced by the construction of shaft tombs and pit graves.138 Kara georghis regards such tombs as "yet another novelty in 127 Steel 2004a, 205.

Although trade with Cilicia and the Levant continued on some level,143 commercial relations with the Aegean and the central Mediterra nean actually seem to have increased.144 With the loss of state control over trade, however, Cypriot elites could no longer display foreign luxury goods as a means to enhance their status.145 Yet there is nothing in the ar chaeological record to indicate that colonizers or mi grants were able to capitalize on this situation. Instead we see remarkable continuity in local material and so cial practices, and it has been argued that one of the most distinctive features of Late Cypriot social practices is the "external referencing and hybridization of Aege an and Near Eastern iconography and equipment."146 Beyond the objects and materials presented here, Steel discusses skeptically various other features associated with mortuary practices, religion, metal hoards, and other crafts that have been linked to an Aegean colo nization of Cyprus during LC IIIA.147 Although several of these features derive from the Aegean, there are just as many exceptions; not least among these are (1) the mirror handles and other ivories from Enkomi whose iconography has been linked to Near Eastern royal ide ologies148 and (2) the unfinished stone cylinders found in the Enkomi level IIIA (LC IIIA) "seal-cutter's work shop," with a western Asian provenance and arguably produced by Levantine craftsmen.149 Other classes of material goods not discussed here?from clay torches and loomweights to seals and sealings to the iconog raphy of ship representations?also have been associ ated with an Aegean or Sea Peoples origin. They, too, however, typically reveal an amalgam of Cypriot, Le vantine, and Aegean elements and reflect much less a single origin than a mixture of ideas and influences from all these areas. The Transition to the Iron Age: Late Cypriot HIB and Cypro-Geometric IA In many respects, the internal situation on Cyprus became more stable and coherent by the end of the 12th century B.C.E. Although this is the beginning of Cyprus' Early Iron Age, it is conventionally termed LC HIB (ca. 1125-1050 B.C.E.).150 Cypriot material culture once again appears predominantly homoge neous, but the practices involved indicate a clear break in tradition.151 Proto-White Painted Wares became the predominant pottery type throughout the island (fig. II).152 Given the long tradition of eclectic mixing in pottery shapes and decoration, it is no surprise that these Proto-White Painted Wares were produced in a standardized style that represents a striking amalga mation of local Cypriot, Aegean, and Levantine tradi tions.153 The same applies to the characteristic White Painted I Ware of CG IA (ca. 1050-1000 B.C.E.), clearly a derivative of Proto-White Painted Ware, but whose appearance coincides with the renewal of contact with the Levant and the advent of Phoenician vessels?im ported and locally produced?in cemeteries through out southern and eastern Cyprus.154 Beyond the pottery, several other objects and mate rials demonstrate various levels of hybridization. New terracotta zoomorphic vessels in the form of bulls, horses, dogs, birds, and two bicephalous human-ani mal examples are larger and more abstract than ear lier varieties.155 Although Karageorghis suggests an Aegean origin for some iconographic features seen on these objects,156 their fabric and decoration nicely complement the Proto-White Painted Ware tradition, with its amalgamation of Aegean, Levantine, and local Cypriot elements. In addition, a new class of figurine often executed in the Proto-White Painted Ware style, 139 Karageorghis 2000,263-64. 140 Niklasson-Sonnerby 1987,224-25; Iacovou 1989,52-3. 141 Leriou 2007,574-75. 142Keswani 2004,159-60. 143Gilboa 1989,2005; Sherratt 1999. 144 Knapp 1990. 145 Sherratt 1998. 146 Steel 2004a, 204. 147 Steel 2004a, 200-10. 148Keswani 1989,68; 2004,127. 149Joyner et al. 2006,140-48; Merrillees 2006. 150 Iacovou 1999b, 2002. 151 Catling 1994,134-35; Steel 2004a, 210. 152 Iacovou 1988,84. 153 Iacovou 1991,204; Sherratt 1991,193; 1992,329-38. 154Negbi 1992; Iacovou 1994,159; Raptou 2002. 155 Courtois 1971,287-308; Webb 1999,216-19. 156Karageorghis 1993,53,60.</page><page sequence="16">674 IOANNIS VOSKOS AND A. BERNARD KNAPP [AJA 112 Fig. 11. ProtoWhite Painted Ware stirrup jar from Gastria Alaas. Nicosia, Cyprus Museum, Tomb 19, no. 3 (courtesy Cyprus Museum). the "goddess with upraised arms," appears with increas ing frequency in LC HIB.157 The earlier (LC II) nude female, mainly Base Ring Ware figurines (of "Astarte" type) declined and then went out of use, much as the traditional handmade wares did.158 Karageorghis believes these new female anthropomorphic vessels represent "a new economic elite" of Aegean origin, per haps originating in Crete along with shrine models, or naiskoi.159 Very similar Aegean-type figurines, however, are also known from several 12th-century B.C.E. Phi listine sites,160 and the earlier "Astarte" figurines were, on stylistic grounds and as their name indicates, typi cally assumed to be of Levantine derivation. Whatever the iconographic differences between the Aegean-type goddesses with upraised arms161 and its local variants (e.g., fig. 12), the more crucial point is how this new Aegean-type figurine was integrated into the local rep ertoire in a typically Cypriot manner. The most abundant evidence of hybridized material goods comes from burials that, especially after ca. 1100 B.C.E., often provide our only source of information for this period. Mortuary practices had changed once again by the 11th century B.C.E. At Salamis, several in fants interred in Levantine-type storage jars represent new funerary rites.162 Moreover, many burials were ac companied by new status symbols such as gold jewelry, bronze vessels, imported Levantine unguent vessels, and Canaanite amphoras.163 All earlier cemeteries were abandoned and new ones established on isolated plots of land well away from the town centers.164 The dead, both cremated and inhumed, and accompanied by numerous grave goods, were now placed in the hybrid "Mycenaean type" chamber tombs with both long and narrow as well as short and wide dromoi.165 No lon ger do we find secondary burials; nor was any special treatment accorded to the skeletons.166 The act of con sciously removing the dead from living areas stands in stark contrast with previous (intramural) practices and probably reflects a different ideological horizon among the inhabitants of Early Iron Age Cyprus. Ia covou believes that these new mortuary practices were carried out by "the foreigners [who] were no longer foreigners."167 In our view, the Aegean, Levantine, and indigenous population elements on Cyprus had by now become fully hybridized.168 One crucial question that arises at this point is the extent to which Aegean Greek-speaking people were involved in all the changes associated with LC HIB. The often-cited inscribed bronze spit from Tomb 49 at Palaepaphos-Skales is engraved with five syllabic signs that form the Greek personal name Opheltas (fig. 13).169 The rendering of this name in the genitive (o pe-le-ta-u) points to the Arcadian dialect.170 This single object has come to stand as an inviolable reference point for those who support the notion of an Aegean colonization of Cyprus during LC HIB or who argue that Greek-speaking people were not only present but politically preeminent on Cyprus by this time.171 The importance assigned to this object seems quite out of proportion. Sherratt pointed out that it is "at 157Karageorghis 1993,1, 58-61 (Type GA[i]); Webb 1999, 213-14, fig. 75. 158 Kling 1989b, 160. 159 Karageorghis 2000, 258-59; see also Karageorghis 1977a, 5; Courtois 1971,343; H?gg 1991. 160 Dothan 1982,234-49. 161 Karageorghis 2000,259, fig. 13.5. 162 Calvet 1980. ,6SColdstream 1989,1994; Rupp 1989. ,64Iacovou 1994,158. ,65Leriou 2007,575. 166Steel 1995,199-200. ,67Iacovou 2005,130-31. 168 See also Iacovou 2006a, 36-44. ,69Karageorghis 1983,59-76. ,70Masson and Masson 1983. 171 E.g., Snodgrass 1988,18-19; Deger-Jalkotzy 1994,11; Ia covou 1999b, 11-12.</page><page sequence="17">2008] CYPRUS AT THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE 675 least in the eleventh century, a thoroughly Cypriot arti fact," and that Opheltas belonged to "a Greek-speaking community whose culture generally is indistinguish able from that of other contemporary Cypriots, who is using a peculiarly Cypriot form of writing in a thor oughly Cypriot, or rather non-Greek manner" (i.e., to indicate personal ownership by inscribing one's name on an object, a practice common to both Cyprus and the Levant but quite foreign to Linear B usage).172 Moreover, the person who inscribed "Opheltas" on this spit was using the common Cypriot syllabary alongside a local Paphian variant (signs for feand w),173 a script that had been employed in Cyprus for at least three centuries before any proposed Aegean colonization of Cyprus. Finally, Tomb 49, the richest burial at Skales, with its elliptical chamber and short dromos, is quite similar to earlier Late Cypriot tomb types.174 In our view, the human remains in Tomb 49 at Palae paphos-Skales belonged to a member of the local Cy priot elite, one who may have had a Greek name but who was not in the least concerned about being bur ied in a distinctively Cypriot manner. Sherratt argued that there is "no demarcation in the general character and background of the material culture of this time to suggest that Greek-speakers and non-Greek-speakers on the island were differentiating themselves in this way."175 Whether Opheltas was aware of any of this is most unlikely, yet his burial exhibits a striking indica tor of the cultural hybridization apparent over all of Cyprus during the 11th century B.C.E. The final, also rather striking change we wish to note is the patterning of Early Iron Age setdements.176 With the exceptions of Palaepaphos, Kition, and Enkomi, all the towns that had been rebuilt and inhabited dur ing LC IIIA were now abandoned or relocated, and several new towns or cemeteries were established, most of which would develop into the kingdoms of Iron Age Cyprus (e.g., Salamis, Idalion, Episkopi-Kalo riziki, Gastria-Alaas, Soloi, Marion, Lapithos). Whether or not those kingdoms actually emerged during the 11th century B.C.E. or some three centuries later is a matter of ongoing debate, one that cannot detain us further here.177 COLONIZATION, OR MIGRATION AND HYBRIDIZATION? So what actually happened during the 12th-llth centuries B.C.E.? Are we dealing with an Aegean colo Fig. 12. LC HIB Cypriot variant of the "goddess with up lifted arms" from Limassol-Komissariato.

How should we identify intrusive and native groups on Cyprus at this time: Achaeans? Greeks? Phoeni cians? Eteocypriots? Or should we abandon all such attempts?178 From the 11th century B.C.E. onward, the archaeological record of Cyprus bears little re semblance to that of the preceding centuries. This was a time of intensive human movements in the east ern Mediterranean, when newcomers and natives on Cyprus transformed the island's material and social practices.

Previous Interpretative Models: Colonization/Hellenization and Mercantile Confederation Until the 1970s, archaeologists often approached the issue of Mycenaean expansion by focusing on ma terial remains thought to reflect historical incidents, such as the return of the Achaean heroes from the Trojan War.179 Based on the amount of LH IIIA-B pottery found on Cyprus, some scholars even argued that the Mycenaeans had colonized Cyprus as early as the 15th-14th centuries B.C.E.180 The amount of My cenaean pottery found on Cyprus, however, must be seen in relation to the overall Late Cypriot ceramic component.181 For example, at Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimi trios, Mycenaean wares make up less than 1 % of the to tal pottery corpus, and the situation islandwide is little different.182 Sherratt has discussed the long-standing tension that exists between those who see pottery as evidence of trade (from Gjerstad to Steel) and those who see it as an "ethnocultural" indicator of large-scale migrations or smaller movements of people (from Myres to Nicolaou and Karageorghis).183 Although most scholars today see pottery as evidence of trade, its ethnocultural status still looms large where it can be demonstrated that previously imported wares were being produced locally, precisely the case for Aegean style pottery found in Cyprus and the Levant during the 13th and 12th centuries B.C.E. The notion of an Aegean colonization of Cyprus still permeates the literature related to this period.184 The appearance of some innovative Aegean features on Cy prus during the 12th century B.C.E. and the fact that Cyprus had become a "largely Greek-speaking island"185 by the Cypro-Archaic period has led many scholars to conclude that Cyprus was colonized by at least two different waves of immigrants?Aegean people and the Sea Peoples?during the 12th and 11th centuries B.C.E. or that some of the latter actually came from the Aegean region. The prominence of Mycenaean IIIC1 pottery in 12th-century B.C.E. deposits, furthermore, seems to have cemented a notion that it takes a Myce naean to make or even use a Mycenaean pot.186 During the 11th century B.C.E., the apparent predominance of some Aegean customs (e.g., the use of Aegean-type figurines, Mycenaean-type chamber tombs) came to be seen as a sign of the Hellenization of the island.187 Al though Vanschoonwinkel critiques the notion of either a Mycenaean colonization or a Mycenaean commercial empire anywhere in the Mediterranean during the 13th-llth centuries B.C.E. and argues for a "progres sive fusion" of Mycenaean and Cypriot material culture, he concludes that the island had become Hellenized by the end of the 11th century B.C.E.188 The deeply felt hold of the "colonization narrative" and the notion of Cyprus' Hellenization during the earliest Iron Age are nowhere more obvious. We have already critiqued this "Hellenization per spective." In the case of Cyprus at the transition to the Iron Age, it is obvious that those who support an "Achaean" colonization of the island have stressed the Aegean features of some classes of material whose character is ambivalent. Moreover, the noticeable con tinuities in architecture, pottery, burial practices, and ideology (e.g., similar mortuary rituals) tend to be ig nored, while emphasis is given to some individual fea tures (cult symbols, weaponry) whose interpretation is at best equivocal. The Cypriots of the 12th-llth centuries B.C.E. were neither "civilized" nor finally 179E.g., Gjerstad 1944; Dikaios 1967; cf. Vanschoonwinkel 2006,78-83. 180E.g., Myres 1914, xxx; Nicolaou 1973. 181 Steel 1998; 2004b, 74-5. 182 Steel 1998,286 n. 5. 183Sherratt 1999,164-68. 184Leriou (2002) provides numerous references. 185Sherratt 1992,326; Karageorghis 1994, 7. ,86Sherratt 1992,318-20. 187E.g., Karageorghis 1990, 29-30. 188Vanschoonwinkel 2006,90-104.</page><page sequence="19">2008] CYPRUS AT THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE 677 "Hellenized" by any superior Greek-speaking popula tions, nor did they absorb passively any specific aspects of Aegean material culture.189 By the beginning of the 17th century B.C.E., the people of Cyprus had attained an advanced level of social complexity, and by the 14th century B.C.E., they had developed aspects of industri alization, if not "urbanization."190 No colonizers taught them how to use the pottery wheel or how to produce iron through carburization.191 None of this, however, means that people from the Aegean never ventured to Cyprus, nor does it mean they made no contribution to Cypriot material culture. In order to determine the nature of Aegean presence on Cyprus, it is crucial to consider how migrants and others involved in contact situations might have met and mixed, and in the pro cess became transformed. Over the past 15 years, partly in reaction to both the Hellenization perspective and the colonization narra tive, an alternative model has emerged, what we term the "mercantile perspective."192 The manifold changes seen in Cypriot society after the collapse of the ex change system (s) of the Late Bronze Age are attributed to new, more localized and entrepreneurial patterns of Mediterranean maritime trade that had originated in the wealthy Cypriot polities of the late 13th century B.C.E. (LCIIC). Artzy discusses how economic merce naries could have evolved from being state-supported intermediaries in Cyprus' trade relationships with vari ous Levantine city-states to becoming entrepreneurial competitors of those same city-states.193 The resulting politicoeconomic configuration would have embraced Cyprus, the southern Levant, and perhaps some areas in the Aegean and southern Anatolia. This interpretation has been contested, at least for the southern Levant.194 With respect to Cyprus, the mercantile perspective has been criticized because it fails to explain the appearance of material elements regarded as intrusive in local assemblages.195 Sherratt may have overstated her case by suggesting that any Aegean people who may have come to Cyprus "were more in the nature of economic and cultural migrants moving from the periphery to the core, from the Prov inces to Versailles" and that "for them acculturation and integration to the cosmopolitan society of Cyprus . . . was a desired and desirable process, and there is every reason to believe from the archaeological record that?assuming they were there at all?this is what they achieved."196 Nonetheless, the "acculturation and in tegration" she sees is undeniable, even if we believe it more appropriate to speak in terms of hybridization and the mixing of cultural traditions. In all these scenarios, we find the same cultural sepa ration between intrusive groups and local inhabitants, the "us vs. them" perspective that has permeated all interpretative models seeking to explain the complex situation on 12th-llth-century B.C.E. Cyprus. Given the inevitable movements of people that must have taken place as international relations broke down at the end of the Late Bronze Age, the concept of hy bridization enables us to consider in a dynamic and nuanced manner how the material representations of such groups became transformed into something entirely new and distinctive. We consider, along with Sherratt,197 the social contexts in which a new sense of identity may have emerged, and how that might have occurred. If people from the Aegean and the Levant (or even Anatolia) migrated to Cyprus at this time, they will have introduced both social and material di versity into different towns and regions on the island, creating new links between distant areas, and in the process obscuring any clear picture of discrete ethnic groups, of "us vs. them." Aegean Peoples Overseas Bearing in mind the fluid nature of ethnic identity, the first thing to question is whether any intrusive groups from the Aegean would have identified them selves as the successors of the Mycenaeans. The collapse of Mycenaean polities in the Aegean world would have led to the fragmentation of any (unlikely) collective identity synonymous with them. If identities are "al ways in process,"198 the journey of any newcomers to Cyprus would also have been a journey to a new iden tity shaped by their social and material background, their customs, and notions of representation. Even if they were conscious of their Aegean origins in the beginning, after two or three generations of intermar riage, of living in their new world, the situation became markedly different. The notable continuities between LC IIC and IIIA indicate that Cypriot material culture of the 12th cen tury B.C.E. was in large part derivative of or developed from that of the preceding period. At the same time, however, there is a continuous penetration into that material culture of Aegean and Levantine elements, all of which were gradually integrated into the local 189 Catling 1994. 190 Knapp 1986a, 1986b; Negbi 2005. 191 Sherratt 1994,61-2. 192Sherratt 1992,1994,1998, 2000; Artzy 1997,1998. 193Artzy 1997,1998. 194Barako 2001. 195Karageorghis 1994, 3-4. 196 Sherratt 1992,325. 197 Sherratt 1992. 198 Hall 1996, 2.</page><page sequence="20">678 IOANNIS VOSKOS AND A. BERNARD KNAPP [AJA 112 traditions, resulting in explicitly hybridized products. This process is perhaps most evident in the pottery as semblages of the 12th century B.C.E., where increasing numbers of shapes and types of decoration, many of Aegean derivation (or inspiration), were introduced and mixed with previous shapes and types. In metal work, we see a similar fusion of Cypriot, Aegean, and Near Eastern elements, but one so implicit that it is impossible to point to a specific cultural region beyond Cyprus itself. Even the terracotta figurines, with their close iconographic parallels to the Aegean, are thor oughly mixed with traditional Cypriot elements. All these hybridization practices imprinted on a wide variety of materials indicate that we are dealing with the cultural entanglement of diverse "social ac tors" of differing origins.199 Such encounters would have comprised intrusive groups from the Aegean or the Levant along with local Cypriots whose material culture had long since embraced multiple and diverse Aegean and Near Eastern elements. This hybridized material culture reflects a social admixture, the en tanglement of different groups of people who contrib uted to its outcome. All these meetings and mixings had crystallized by the 11th century B.C.E., when we observe over the entire island fairly homogeneous ma terial and technological traditions that blend elements of local, Levantine, and Aegean ancestry. The archaeological record that demonstrates these social and material mixings reveals no sign of a division between intrusive and local populations.200 Certainly the newcomers did not arrive as conquering colonists. There are no separate enclaves or other markers of distinction and, more significantly, no evidence of eco nomic or political manipulation by superior colonists against the native population. Given the manifesta tions and boundaries of social or ethnic identities, in a colonization horizon we would expect to find clear material distinctions between the colonizers and the colonized. What we actually find are multiple ex amples across virtually all classes of material that are completely ambiguous in terms of establishing distinct social or ethnic identities. In other words, any Aegean people who had arrived on Cyprus by this time had become entangled in processes of hybridization, both as social actors and in their use of material culture?in pottery, coroplastic arts, metal products, ivory, seals, use of the local script for writing, and mortuary rituals and practices. The ongoing process?if not quite end result?of this hybridization may be seen in the largely homogeneous quality of Cypriot material culture dur ing the 11th century B.C.E., with its amalgamation of Cypriot, Levantine, and Aegean elements. OVERVIEW AND CONCLUSION The Cypriot archaeological record of the 12th-l 1 th centuries B.C.E. offers an array of evidence for a move ment of people that, however limited its impact at the time, would become of lasting historical significance for the island. In discussing various factors that may impel migrants to move, Anthony notes: "migration is most likely to occur when there are negative (push) stresses in the home region and positive (pull) attrac tions in the destination region."201 People who un dertake long-distance migrations are often those who had previously been involved in subsistence strategies that became unsustainable (e.g., specialized farmers or laborers).202 This is just one possible scenario to explain what may have happened to all those special ized artisans and producers recorded in the Linear B tablets (e.g., makers of perfumed oils, wines, wool) in the Late Bronze Aegean after its highly centralized palatial system collapsed. At the same time on Cyprus, however, there is no evidence of an economic collapse, and some have even argued that the island may have offered migrants the opportunity to pursue their old professions or adopt new ones.203 Given the long-standing evidence for trade contacts, many people from the Aegean, in particular merchants and artisans, would have been quite famil iar with their (Cypriot) destination. The "successive waves of settlers from Mycenaean Greece"204 represent a movement drawn out over more than a century, one that may well have been characterized by some return migration. Thus, for example, we note the discovery of a bronze amphoroid krater used as an ash urn and found in the tomb of the "Hero of Lefkandi," as well as other bronzes, including an openwork four-sided support of Cypriot type, from the Sub-Minoan graves in the North Cemetery at Knossos.205 Archaeologists, ancient historians, and philologists working on Cyprus have quite different views of ethnic ity on Early Iron Age Cyprus.206 In this regard, it must be pointed out that tombs uncovered at LC HIB (late) Skales, like those from the following CG I cemeteries around Palaepaphos (Plakes, Hasan, Lakkos tou Skar nou, Xerolimni/Xylinos), are quite uniform in type 199van Dommelen 2005,117-18. 200Leriou 2007,577-79. 201 Anthony 1990,899. 202 Anthony 1990,901. 203E.g., Coldstream 1994; Karageorghis 1994. 204Snodgrass 1988,12; Karageorghis 1994, 6. 205 Catling 1994,137-38 (with references); Stampolidis and Kotsonas 2006, 340. 206E.g., Iacovou 2005, 2006a; Palaima 2005.</page><page sequence="21">2008] CYPRUS AT THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE 679 (chamber tombs) and in their mortuary equipment.207 As a result, it is impossible to establish any ethnic boundaries that would have separated those who were buried in these tombs. Iacovou, too, has criticized those who see an ethnic mosaic in the necropolis at Skales, arguing that the Early Cypro-Geometric mortuary de posits at Skales, Lapithos, Kythrea, Kition, Amathus, and Kourion were "the well-cared for burial plots of securely established, culturally homogeneous and quite prosperous communities."208 Any focal movement of a distinctive ethnic group bent on establishing control over Cyprus would have produced quite a different material record, one represented by specific kinds of personal belongings and other intrusive items. From all this, we conclude that at some point dur ing the 11th century B.C.E., some people of Aegean origin (migrants, not purposive colonists) became es tablished on Cyprus, an "event" that remained deeply rooted in the memory of Greeks, whether in Greece or on Cyprus. We cannot define this event any more precisely because the social processes involved in it?social exchange, migration, hybridization?had been going on for 200-300 years. The identities of the people involved, whatever their ethnic or social background, became altered along with their mate rial representations. After a century or more of nego tiation and reinterpretation, a new identity emerged, one that held meaning for all the inhabitants of Early Iron Age Cyprus. No doubt new elite groups emerged at this time: Phoenician elements in towns such as Kition, Eteocypriot speakers in Amathus, and a mix ture of native Cypriot and intrusive Aegean elements elsewhere and everywhere. Some of them must have been speakers of Greek, and ultimately their coopera tion and entanglement with local Cypriots led to the "Greek-Cypriot ethnogenesis,"209 whose ultimate out come would be the "Pan-Cyprian koine culture" of the llth-10th centuries B.C.E.210 In this study, we have argued that the "Mycenaean colonization" of Cyprus was neither Mycenaean nor a colonization. The late 13th through 11th centuries B.C.E. was a time when some people with an Aegean cultural background came to Cyprus and in the hy bridization processes that ensued underwent inten sive social transformation. Given all the continuities seen in Cypriot material culture and social practices, these Aegean settlers, if such they were, seem to have become well integrated into Cypriot society. Notions that involve the passive acceptance by local Cypriots of a superior Mycenaean culture and the absorption of local inhabitants into displaced Aegean power struc tures need to be abandoned entirely. They must be replaced by more nuanced considerations of the ways that migrants and local peoples interacted with each other, how hybridization led to new social and mate rial practices and to a new identity that was far more than the sum of its individual parts. In such a scenario, we neither ignore local agency nor underestimate the Aegean contribution to all the changes that took place on Cyprus at the transition to the Iron Age.
