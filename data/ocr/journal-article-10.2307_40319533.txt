<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" Sandra B. Rosenthal Though both C. S. Peirce and C. I. Lewis explicitly profess their pragmatism, they are continually being interpreted within the framework of realism, idealism, or phenomenal- ism. Indeed, Lewis himself cannot decide whether he should be termed a realist or a phenomenalist,1 while Peirce vacil- lates between realism and idealism - among other less fre- quently asserted alternatives. That they explicitly vacillate between traditional alternatives in characterizing their over- all philosophical positions is not strange, for they have indi- cated, either explicitly or implicitly, that their pragmatism is limited to epistemology - more specifically, to an epistemo- logical level which begins above that of a detailed analysis of the subject-object relation in perception; only in this way does their pragmatism do its intended job of keeping one totally within the realm of experience and avoiding contact with "anti-pragmatic" metaphysical issues. As Lewis notes, the subject-object relation is at one and the same time episte- mological and metaphysical, for it is not a relation both ends of which necessarily lie in cognitive experience itself.2 Nevertheless, in spite of their persistent attempts to limit their pragmatism, it may be that it reaches beyond the limits in both the method and content of their metaphysics. Thus, it may be that their metaphysics cannot be confined within tra- 74</page><page sequence="2">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" ditional alternatives because the unifying thread running through each of their respective philosophies - as well as be- tween them - is not any of these traditional alternatives but rather is a thoroughgoing though often implicit pragmatic orientation. If the pragmatic doctrines of Lewis and Peirce are to be seen to have systematic significance beyond the narrowly epis- temological confines of pragmatism, the primitive subject- object perceptual relation- - at once metaphysical and episte- mological - is the most promising place to begin looking, for if this relation is seen to be influenced by and continuous with their pragmatic orientation as explicitly developed in their theory of meaning, then the metaphysical position which forms one terminus of this relationship may be ex- pected also to be continuous with their pragmatism. It may be held that the subject-object relation is not ignored, for a qualitative content is given for conceptual interpretation. In Lewis' terminology, the perceptual experience involves an element of givenness of qualia and an element of conceptual interpretation. In Peirce's terminology every experience has an element of qualitative immediacy or Firstness. However, if the perceptual doctrines of Lewis and Peirce are to provide the path by which to make explicit the systematic significance of their pragmatism, then one question which must be an- swered is the nature of this given content or qualitative im- mediacy. It is with this issue that the present paper will deal. When the epistemological terms used by Lewis are not au- tomatically given the traditional meanings attached to them but rather are interpreted within the context of Lewis* own statements in which they are embedded, the outlines of a pragmatic theory of givenness begin to come into focus. Though Lewis' own statements which indicate this point of view are somewhat incomplete, Peirce's more profuse but more random insights help to fill in the position which Lewis seems to be indicating. Yet, because Lewis' explicit episte- mological examinations are more clearly delineated, more con- cise, and more systematic than Peirce's insights, when Lewis' 75</page><page sequence="3">Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society theory is filled in it provides a precise conceptual scheme which can lend order to Peirce's highly unsystematic presen- tation of the role of Firstness in perception. And, because Peirce is more directly concerned with explicit metaphysical issues, his theory of the role of Firstness in perception, once clarified, appears rich with metaphysical implications which do not accord well with traditional alternatives - though the development of these implications lies beyond the scope of this paper. It may seem somewhat arbitrary to use Peirce and Lewis for mutual clarification on this point, but the justification of such a procedure can be assessed only in terms of the intel- ligibility of the distinctively pragmatic concept of "given- ness" which emerges from such an interrelationship. Indeed, according to their own pragmatic doctrines, the adequacy of any interpretive schema can be determined in no other way. Thus, it is only at the conclusion of this paper that one can ask the question, is the present procedure arbitrary?3 Even at the end of this paper, however, the question cannot be con- clusively answered, for though a distinctively pragmatic con- cept of "the given" in perception will have emerged which, it is hoped, will partially justify the present procedure, a point of departure for the exploration of metaphysical issues can be only briefly suggested. To develop the present view, three interrelated concepts found in Lewis' epistemology will be analyzed: "the given," "certainty," and "qualia." In any analysis of Lewis' position one must remember that Mind and the World Order pro- vides the foundation upon which An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation rests. In the former, the concept of the given is defined; in the latter, its role in cognition is analyzed. And, in the present discussion, one must constantly keep in mind that for Lewis "there is in all strictness only one given, the Berg- sonian real duration . . ."4 The absolute given, holds Lewis, is a "specious present, fading into the past and growing into the future with no genuine boundaries . . . the breaking of 76</page><page sequence="4">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" this up . . . marks already the activity of an interested mind (MWO,p.5S)." Thus, when Lewis speaks of the given as the bedrock data for cognition, it would seem that he is speaking not of the absolute given; let us call it rather the relative given, a given which has already been informed by mind at least in a rudi- mentary sense. It is a given which mind has delimited and abstracted from the absolute given, the Bergsonian real dura- tion. I shall call this real duration when referring to it throughout the present essay "the concrete flux." The term "concrete" is intended to indicate that which is opposed to the abstract. The flux, as concrete, is that from which we abstract. As concrete, it is infinitely rich, richer than any pos- sible abstraction we can make from it. The relative given which mind abstracts, though qualitatively rich, is only a se- lection from the infinite richness of the concrete flux. And, because the mind can work only in the light of the habits it has formed, this relative given already bears the stamp of mind's activity. As Lewis notes, "the earliest cognitions of a mind like ours are continuous with those modes of animal behavior which foreshadow explicit knowledge."5 Lewis makes this distinction in levels of givenness though he does not dwell upon it since his interests lie elsewhere. It is essen- tial in understanding his position as a whole. The given, as it enters into the conscious cognitive process is, in fact, a taken. As Lewis notes: Even in that sense in which the given is always one whole it is not important for our purpose of analyzing knowledge that we should dwell upon this integrality of it. Our interest is, rather, in the ele- ment of givenness in which we may, for usual . and commonplace reasons, mark off as "an experience" or "an object." (MWO, p. 59) It is this relative givenness which is important for the analysis in which Lewis is interested. It may be asked, if the given in experience is for Lewis the relative given characterized above, how can Lewis attribute certainty to it? If the given is, in fact, a taken, is not error 77</page><page sequence="5">Transactions of the Charles S. Peiice Society possible? If so, what happens to the certainty which Lewis emphasizes as the bedrock of empirical knowledge? This problem can best be handled by turning to Peirce's theory of perception. Very briefly, Peirce holds that there are three levels in per- ception: sense stimuli, percepts, and perceptual judgments. The process by which percepts result from sense stimuli is unknown; we arc never conscious of stimuli but of qualities which are synthesized from them. Perceptual judgments re- sult from percepts by abduction or hypothetic inference. What Peirce means by the perceptual judgment is best illus- trated in his statement that "The perceptual judgments de- clare one thing to be blue, another yellow - one sound to be that of A, another that of U, another that of I."6 And, as Peirce indicates elsewhere, the perceptual judgment can often best be expressed in the language of appearing (7.636, 5.157). Thus, what Peirce means by the perceptual judgment as expressed in the language of appearing is the recognition of the percept as an immediate content. Some confusion may arise here because Peirce stresses that the perceptual judg- ment is not like the percept. This should not be taken to mean that the perceptual judgment in Peirce's language is the expressive statement in Lewis' language. Rather, the per- ceptual judgment for Peirce in the above sense is that in- stantaneous recognition of what is presented. It is what can be most closely captured through expressive language but which is itself epistemologically prior to any language. What he means by stressing the difference between the percept and the perceptual judgment can best be understood from the following: It may be objected that the terms of the judgment resemble the percept. Let us consider, first, the predicate, "yellow" in the judgment that "this chair appears yellow." This predicate is not the sensation involved in the percept, because it is general. It doesn't even refer particularly to this percept but to a sort of composite photograph of all the yellows that have been. On the whole, it is plain enough that 78</page><page sequence="6">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" the perceptual judgment is not a copy, icon, or diagram of the per- cept, however rough. It may be reckoned as a higher grade of the operation of perception. (7. 634, italics added) The term "sensation" in the above passage must not be taken literally, for Peirce denies first impressions of sense (5.213, 7.465). What is important to note is that the percept and the perceptual judgment are two different "operations" occurring in perception which, as will become clear below, are analytically distinguishable though always experienced in union. That Peirce terms this instantaneous recognition "judgment," while Lewis refuses to classify recognition as judgment, does not represent a basic disagreement over the nature of perception, but rather a purely terminological difference. As Lewis so aptly notes: Whether one should say that there must be concepts of qualia be- cause they are recognized, or no concepts of qualia because they are ineffable; . . . whether this direct awareness should be merely desig- nated or should be termed "judgment" - all this has to do only with the meaning of the terms . . . What I wish to point out is the real and important distinction between qualia and the immediate aware- ness of them on the one hand and the properties of objects and our knowledge of them on the other. (MWO, p. 124, italics added) Peirce notes that for both the formation of the percept and the perceptual judgment, the process is automatic and not subject to self-control (5.115 ff.). Furthermore, the testimony of the perceptual judgment must be taken as authentic be- cause it is indubitable (2.27, 5.181). But, why is it indubita- ble? Because it can never be showTn to be false. One cannot test the perceptual judgment by getting "behind" it to com- pare it with anything more fundamental; nor can one test it by reference to future experience, for as indicating the con- tent of a "seeming" statement, it implies nothing concerning future experience; for us, it must itself be the final court of appeal. And, applying this to Lewis, the recognition of the relative given is beyond doubt because to doubt it in the sense that one thinks it may be proven wrong is senseless; indeed, literally so. To doubt it is to put into question some- 79</page><page sequence="7">Transactions oí the Charles S. Peirce Society thing for which there is no more fundamental tool by which it can be questioned. Hence, the most fundamental taken of conscious experience must be accepted, for all intents and purposes, as the bedrock of certainty upon which to build knowledge. That Lewis is in agreement with Peirce concerning the type of certainty involved, a certainty which can best be termed "pragmatic certainty," seems indicated from his as- sertion that recognition of a presented quale is immediate and indubitable "¿n the sense that verification would have no meaning with respect to it (MWO, p. 125, italics added)." Again, he states that "awareness of it [the presented quale] is not judgment in any sense in which judgment may be veri- fied; it is not knowledge in any sense in which 'knowledge' connotes the opposite of error (MWO, p. 125)." Indeed, the opposite of error in this context is truth or correctness, and neither of these latter terms is applicable to the presented quale. As will be shown below, a quale is neither true nor false of anything; it just is. Truth and falsity are inapplicable to the presented quale. Similarly, correct and incorrect, as descriptive of our "immediate apprehension" of or recogni- tion of a presented quale, are inapplicable. There is no cor- rect or incorrect apprehension of a presented quale, for what a quale "is" is determined only in its apprehension. Lewis holds that qualia are subjective in the sense that one cannot speak of "unsensed qualia (MWO, pp. 63-64)." But, does this mean that they can in any way be reduced to sensa- tions? Lewis states emphatically that "sense data, defined by correlation with nervous processes, should have no place in our program (MWO, p. 57)." Thus, in a loose sense, qualia must be "in consciousness" by their very nature, yet, they are definitely not sensations. This notion of qualia being "in consciousness" even in a loose sense of the words may seem to indicate some sort of dualism. However, in an important footnote Lewis states that there is intended no dualistic or phenomenalistic interpreta- tion of the relation of mind to reality in cognition. It is possi- 80</page><page sequence="8">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" ble to assert that the content of presentation - the qualia in our present discussion - is an authentic part or aspect or per- spective which is ingredient in the objective reality known (AKV, pp. 187-188). In short, we are not seeing a sensation of blue, nor are we seeing blue in our consciousness, nor is part of our consciousness blue, but rather we are conscious of the appearance of something blue. As Peirce states, it is not im- pressions which are blue, for they can have no color, but the objects to which we refer them.7 It may be objected that if qualia are authentic aspects in- gredient in the objective reality known, then they can surely be incorrectly apprehended. Here, however, certain impor- tant distinctions need emphasis. The objective reality which is known is identical neither with the concrete flux nor with the presented qualia. Similarly, the presented qualia are identical neither with the quality as an objective property of some categorized object nor with the concrete flux. Nor do qualia copy anything; they are precisely and only as they are taken. And, while the objective color property is a potential- ity or dispositional trait,8 the quale is best spoken of, not in terms of potentiality, but of actuality. Until qualia are con- ceptually interpreted as indicating an objective property, they imply nothing concerning future experience. However, this threefold distinction among stimuli of the concrete flux, qualia, and objective properties should not be taken to indicate a three term or representative theory of' perception. The above interpretation is intended to indicate that qualia are emergents in organism-environment interac- tion in that presented qualia are the stimuli as related to the organism through this interaction. Qualia are not a copy of the stimuli of the concrete flux but are the stimuli of the concrete flux as seen. Hence, there is no "third term." Yet, qualia cannot be incorrectly apprehended, for apart from our apprehension of them there are no qualia but only the indefi- nite stimuli of the given flux. Thus, Lewis can consistently assert both that qualia are ingredient in the objective reality known and that qualia cannot be incorrectly apprehended, 81</page><page sequence="9">Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society for they are only in their apprehension. The distinction among the stimuli of the absolute given, the qualia of the relative given, and objective properties is a distinction among levels of interpretation. The most crucial assertions made by Lewis concerning qualia describe them as: universals (MWO, p. 123), intrin- sically recognizable (MWO, p. 61), and repeatable in experi- ence (MWO, p. 61). It is to the clarification of these state- ments that we must now turn. According to Lewis qualia are universals, but they are universals in the sense that "without the recognition of them by the individual, nothing presented in experience could be named or understood at all (MWO, p. 123, italics added)." Thus, they are universals not because of any metaphysical or logical status which they have but be- cause of their role or function in cognition. They are, in short, what can perhaps best be termed "pragmatic univer- sals." Turning to the second characteristic of qualia as set forth by Lewis, we see that they are intrinsically recognizable. But in what sense? Taking the cue from Peirce, they are intrinsi- cally recognizable in the sense that there is no more funda- mental element by which to recognize them, for they them- selves are epistemologically the most primitive apprehensions of a conscious being. This statement can best be understood, however, in conjunction with the statement that qualia are repeatable in experience. The following discussion, then, will show that qualia are repeatable in experience and intrinsi- cally recognizable because they are a product, in a certain sense, of mind's activity. When Lewis speaks of the repeata- bility of the qualia of the given, one must remember that this given, as indicated earlier, is itself a taken from the concrete flux. The mind, in its characteristic manner of abstracting, synthesizing, and relating, takes the diverse stimuli which are given in the pure givenness of concrete passage and "presents them to consciousness" as repeatable and recognizable quali- ties; in short, the mind presents them to consciousness as the qualia of the given. 82</page><page sequence="10">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" The direction to be followed here is indicated by Peirce, even though it is in a very confused passage. Taking the ex- ample, "yesterday I saw a blue color; and here is a blue color," he notes that "some beginner may object that they have both a blueness in them; but I reply that blueness is nothing but the idea of these sensations and of others I have had, thrown together and indistinctly thought at once (7.392)." This is perhaps a good example of Peirce's too often confused way of speaking, for as we have already seen, he denies that we can have an idea of a sensation. However, the general direction of his thought is clear enough. We cannot compare presentations in terms of the quality, "blueness," for the repeatable quality is dependent upon the assimilation of past and present presentations. There are two different levels of assimilation to be distin- guished here, however. On the one hand, there is the assimi- lation by which stimuli are taken by the mind and seen as qualia. Indeed, this is what was earlier indicated as analogous to the first step in the formation of the perceptual judgment - the formation of the percept itself. Then, there is the as- similation by which past qualia are held in the mind, so to speak, and provide a primitive sort of criterion of recognition or "composite photograph (7.634)" by which a present quale is assimilated to past presentations of qualia and taken to be "the same." This is the second step in the process discussed earlier, the step in which we recognize a presented quale via the formation of the perceptual judgment. But, as was noted earlier, both steps are equally uncontrollable and uncriticiza- ble. We cannot merely contemplate a quale, for the tendency of the mind is to assimilate it0 to certain criteria of recognition which the mind has held apart from the context of past ex- perience. And, in the sense that this recognition is instantane- ous and uncontrollable, and dependent only upon the past presentations of qualia, it is intrinsic to the qualia involved. Furthermore, qualia are repeatable because we do in fact make them to be so in that we do assimilate one presentation to past presentations. Indeed, it is much more accurate to say 83</page><page sequence="11">Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society that we see one presentation in the light of past presentations, for this assimilation is not a process of which we are sepa- rately aware. This entire process is summed up by Peirce in two state- ments which he makes in his own brief discussion of qualia, or as he terms it, "quale consciousness." He states that "There is a distinctive quale to every combination of sensa- tions so far as it is really synthesized . . . (6.222)." And again, "Each quale is in itself what it is for itself, without reference to any other . . . Nevertheless, comparing consciousness does pronounce them to be alike. They are alike to the comparing consciousness, though neither alike nor unlike in themselves. (6.224)." What, however, is the distinction intended by the use of the term "quale" rather than "percept"? We have already seen that what is immediately recognized as given, though expressed in language, is epistemologically prior to language. And, what is given as the percept interpreted in the per- ceptual judgment, or the immediate recognition of the per- cept, and then expressed in the language of appearing or seeming, is not a "collection" of atomic qualia, but rather a gestalt or relation of qualia. Our immediate recognition of the given, as the indubitable content of experience, is not a synthesis of atomic qualia. Rather, the recognized content is a unitary percept or "feeling tone" which, Peirce holds, has its own distinctive quale, a unitary quale or experience content which is analyzed rather than synthesized in the process of recognition. As Murphey writes in discussing Firstness in Peirce's philosophy (a concept which will be shown below to be, in two of its senses, identifiable with qualia): A First is not the same as what is usually called a percept . . . which has a structure and which combines a number of sense qualities. A pure First ... is simple and devoid of structure. But every percept has a First which is the single impression created by the total ensem- ble of its elements. Moreover, if a single sense quality of a percept is prescinded from all the rest and is considered by itself, such a quality is a First.9 84</page><page sequence="12">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" Thus, we arrive at the role of First ness in Peirce's theory of perception. As Stearns remarks, "Firstness is without any doubt the most elusive of Peirce's categories."10 That it is elusive is surely true. It has often been said however, that its character- ization is inherently inconsistent. This statement is debatable. The charge of inconsistency is based both on Peirce's diverse characterizations of First ness11 and on his change in emphasis between earlier and later writings.12 For example, Peirce speaks of Firstness as ineffable and unknowable ( 1 .357). as consisting of qualities of feelings (5/111), and as possibility (1.23). Again, in the "New List" Peirce concerns hi nisei I with quality determining a class, while in the 1885 formulation, it is the sensory aspect which comes to the fore. The following discussion will show that Firstness is at once, but without inconsistency, quality of feeling, ineffable and unknowable, and pure possibility. Furthermore, it is both quality determining a class and quality as the sensory element of experience. In the following discussion, three as|&gt;ec:ls of Peirce's cate- gory of Firstness will be considered. For purposes ol clarity, these will be termed the material aspect, the epistemological asjMxt, and the metaphysical aspect. The material aspect will be seen to correspond to the most primitive aspect of First- ness as it enters into experience. The epistemological aspect will be seen to correspond to the logical function of Firstness in cognition. And, finally, the metaphysical asj&gt;ect will be seen to coi respond to what could be allied the condition for the experience ol Firstness or that asjxxt of Firstness which explains or accounts for the experience of Firstness. Before discussing Firstness in its material m&lt;xlc, it must be pointed out that this level of Firstness, which will be seen to be identifiable with the level of uninterpreted qualia, is not important for analyzing sophisticated cognition. What is im- portant at this latter level is the prediction of future exjxni- ence based upon a recognized content. Thus. Lewis can al- 85</page><page sequence="13">Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society most totally ignore this primitive level and Peirce can note that it can logically be included with the next level, the level of a recognized content, because of the almost surdity of both (7.628-7.629). Yet, the importance of this level, if one is inter- ested in a broader context than that of the pragmatic concept of meaning, is clear. Its importance lies in the consideration that if qualia are unique in the most primitive experience of them and if it is "comparing consciousness" that makes them repeatable, then Firstness in its metaphysical aspect, possibil- ity, does not indicate any sort of determinate repeatables. That Peirce's characterizations of Firstness at times corre- spond quite closely to his characterization of an uninter- preted quale as an analytic element in perception can be seen from his statement that "Firstness is predominant, not neces- sarily on account of the abstractness of that idea, but on ac- count of its self-con tainedness. It is not in being separated from qualities that Firstness is most predominant, but in being something peculiar and idiosyncratic (1.302). Thus, it seems that Firstness, in the present sense, is not identical with qualities but yét cannot be totally separated from them. Uninterpreted qualia are, in short, the material for the repeatable and recognizable though ineffable qualia of conscious experience which in turn form the basis for our concepts of objective qualities or properties. Indeed, qualia "in themselves" as "absolutely simple," and "absolutely free (6.236)" are "what the world was to Adam on the day he opened his eyes to it ... that is first present, immediate, fresh, new, initiative, original, spontaneous, free . . . (1.357)." Turning now to qualia as "alike to the comparing con- sciousness," or, in other terms, Firstness in its epistemological aspect, we can see that qualia are in one sense the most ab- stract elements of the phenomenon, though this does not con- tradict their characterization as Firsts. The recognized qualia are the most abstract of the phenomena in the sense in which abstraction is equated with precision. By abstraction or preci- sion Peirce means a mental separation which "arises from at- 86</page><page sequence="14">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" tention to one element and neglect of the other (1.549)."13 And, in this sense, qualia, as the recognizable but ineffable element in experience are the most abstract of the phe- nomena of experience and of the nature of Firstness, for while pure abstraction can be reached by the agreement of things in some respect, Peirce denies the relativity of First- ness to anything else by which it is grasped. Thus, in its epis- temological sense, a First is an immediately recognized quale. The recognized quale is characterized as a first because of its role or function in cognition; it is a pragmatic universal as indicated above. At this level qualia are indeed "repeatable in experience and intrinsically recognizable," but to allow this to lead to a metaphysics which gives an independent ontological status in any sense to determinate repeatables is completely to ignore the more primitive material mode of Firstness. Peirce's characterization of Firstness as unknowable indi- cates that it is an analytic element in experience. We cannot know Firsts in their purity. Though no element of the phaneron exists in isolation, even the "conceptual isolation" of Firstness for purposes of analysis is difficult because of its primitive nature. Peirce stresses that every description of it must be false to it (1.357). Peirce's statement that Firstness is quality of feeling does not, however, contradict this charac- terization of it as knowable, for as will be seen below, quality of feeling indicates not an internal state of an organism but precisely what is, in its purity, unknowable. To think of feel- ing as used by Peirce in terms of psychology is to be misled by a word, for as Peirce himself emphatically states, "If by 'psy- chology' we mean the positive or observation science of the mind or consciousness . . . psychology can teach us nothing of the nature of feeling, nor can we gain knowledge of any feeling by introspection, for the very reason that it is our immediate consciousness (1.308)." The same difficulty of characterizing the given in "any terms which are not thus preempted to slightly different use (MWO, p. 57)" is indicated by Lewis when he characterizes 87</page><page sequence="15">Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society the given in terms of "its character as sensuous feel or quality (MWO, pp. 52-53)." Or again, as he attempts to limit it, "If it be understood that the methodological connotation of psy- chological categories is not here in point, it will cause no confusion if I continue to refer to the 'sensuous' or the 'feel- ing' character of the given (MWO, p. 57)." Indeed, as Lewis notes, to regard "feeling" in the above sense as a psychologi- cal description is conceptually to interpret it and make an objective statement about one type of categorized reality - psychic reality (MWO, p. 127, note). Thus, it becomes evi- dent that feeling, sensuous feel, or quality of feeling is in- tended to indicate precisely that which is, in its purity, un- knowable, not a "state of an organism. That is, qualia apart from their conceptual interpretations or predictive meanings or "coating" of Thirdness do not comprise knowledge; neither do we know qualia apart from such interpretations. As indicated earlier, though in different terminology, the difference between a felt content and a known objective property is not the difference between the psychical and the physical or between internal and external, but between First- ness and Thirdness, between preconceptual and conceptual. Indeed, Peirce insists emphatically upon a theory of direct perception (5.56). That the term "quality" is used both by Lewis and Peirce in indicating the "sensuous feel" of what is presented is some- what unfortunate, but it becomes clear from the context in which each uses the term that what is intended is neither some conceptualized objective property which implies future possibilities of experience nor the pure stimuli of the abso- lute given, but rather, what is intended is qualitative pre- sentation or qualia. Quality of feeling, then, indicates that which can be characterized neither as knowable nor as psy- chological. And, it is as recognized qualia or quality of feeling that Firstness is quality determining a class, for what is deter- mined is not a class of known objective properties but a class of recognized "felt" contents or pragmatic universals. Before proceeding to the metaphysical aspect of Firstness, 88</page><page sequence="16">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" it will be helpful to summarize the framework within which the pragmatic concept of the given has emerged. The mind interprets in two ways, or rather, it should perhaps be said, in two different directions, which differ in degree but not in kind and which are analytically distinguishable though al- ways experienced in union in the actual perceptual process. First, the mind is aware of something in the light of some- thing else which has occurred at some more fundamental epistemological level or some previous time. And, secondly, the mind can take something of which it is presently aware to stand for something else. In this latter case, the presentation is not assimilated to the past but referred to the future (though of course the future consequences to be expected have been learned from past experience). Thus, the stimuli which prompt the organism to action are grasped by the mind, and, in being grasped are assimilated to form perceptual qualia, and past perceptual qualia are held in the mind as a primitive sort of criterion of recognition or "composite photograph" by which a present content is assimi- lated to past ones and recognized as "the same." Then, on the basis of this relative given, or primitive taken, which contains no predictive meaning, the level of full conceptual inter- pretation or predictive meaning or Thirdness is added, and the minded organism thus categorizes and groups its experi- ence to form the objective reality in which it lives. The recognized content which forms the basis for our pre- dictive meanings or perception of objective facts yields not absolute certainty but pragmatic certainty.14 Its repeatability indicates not a logical or metaphysical universal but a prag- matic universal.15 And, finally, this certain and repeatable given is not an absolute given but a relative or "pragmatic given."16 In the light of the above discussion, we can now see what the final aspect of Firstness indicated above, the metaphysical aspect, shows concerning the nature of the absolute given or, in other terms, metaphysical reality. That Firstness in its metaphysical aspect can best be approached via Peirce's the- 89</page><page sequence="17">Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society ory of perception is evidenced from his statement that "The premisses of nature . . . though they are not the perceptual facts that are premisses to us, nevertheless must resemble them in being premisses. We can only imagine what they are by comparing them with premisses for us. As premisses they involve qualities (5.119, italics added)." Perceptual experi- ence, then, indicates that the absolute given is qualitatively rich. Thus, Peirce states, in characterizing Firstness, "The word possibility fits it, except that possibility implies a rela- tion to what exists, while universal Firstness is the mode of being of itself (1.531)." Or, as he clarifies his meaning in speaking more directly of perception (which is one form of interaction or existence), "No sensation nor sense faculty is requisite for the possibility which is the being of the quality (1.422)." Firstness, then, as possibility, indicates the meta- physical conditions which allow for the epistemological gene- sis of pragmatic universals. However, entering the domain of metaphysical reality via the path of perception - a path clearly indicated by Peirce - brings out more than the fact that the First category is "a real constituent of the universe (5.82)" in the above way. It indi- cates that any discussion of such matters can be only some- what imaginative or metaphorical, since we "imagine the premisses of nature by comparing them with the premisses for us."17 It would seem, then, that Peirce's speculative metaphysical discussions of the three categories and their mode of interrelation can best be understood by constant ref- erence to some analogue to be found in his theory of percep- tion. As Peirce indicates elsewhere, his metaphysics is anthro- pomorphic, but he must be allowed his own private meaning of anthropomorphism (5.356). And, as he continues to clarify his own private meaning, we see that he holds not that the "matter" of metaphysics is of the nature of our experience but that we can understand it or even coneive of it only as analogous to our experience (5.356). Thus, it would seem that perceptual experience provides the point of departure for a consciously metaphorical or anthropomorphic discus- 90</page><page sequence="18">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" sion of metaphysical issues. Indeed, it is perhaps precisely such a metaphorical assertion of the view that the "secondary qualities" are to be found in nature which leads Peirce to his cryptic statement that "it is a psychic feeling of red without us which arouses a sympathetic feeling of red in our senses (1.311)." Peirce's metaphysical discussions are couched in speculative and anthropomorphic language, not in spite of the limits of meaningfulness imposed by his pragmatic empir- icism but because of them. His metaphysical discussions can be highly metaphorical because he recognizes them to be metaphor. We have seen that the stimuli of the flux are qualitatively rich. Barren primary qualities do not "cause" secondary qualities, but rather the so-called secondary qualities are there as "part of the diverse and somewhat indefinite stimuli of the flux, to be assimilated by the organism to form the qualia of the relative given. That Peirce does intend to so characterize the qualitative stimuli "that are there" can be seen by what would appear to be a perfectly acceptable ex- pansion of his statement that "that very same logical element of experience, the quale-element, which appears upon the in- side as unity, when viewed from the outside is seen as variety (6.236)," and again, "no unity can originate in concentration . . . but any unity there [sic] was there already may in that way, be many times intensified (6.227)." That Peirce charac- terizes the quale-element, which appears "upon the inside as unity, and upon the outside as variety," as the same logical element is merely a recognition of the fact that this distinc- tion is not needed if one is considering only the logical or epistemological function of qüalia in cognition. And, since an uninterpreted quale is itself a "synthesis of sensations" then surely at this level also, what is seen on the inside as unity will be seen on the outside as variety. Here, however, it is crucial to note that although Peirce uses the terms "impres- sion" or "sensation" quite often, he explicitly indicates both that there are no first impressions of sense (5.213, 7.465) and that when he does use the term "impression" it is used as a 91</page><page sequence="19">Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society limiting concept to indicate the boundary of consciousness.18 Thus, the concept of a synthesis of impressions or a "total impression" merges with the concept of the point of organism environment interaction or the concept of strands of stimuli as seen. Just as recognition unifies diverse qualia, so qualia unify diverse stimuli. And, just as the unifying function of recognition must have some basis upon which to work - however vague this basis may be - so the unifying function of the "production" of qualia must have some objective basis, no matter how vague, upon which to work. Thus, the stimuli of the flux, though not fully structured, have a vague character of some sort. Though alternative ab- stractions and syntheses may be possible, the range of possi- bilities is limited. In short, the repeatable and recognizable qualia of the given have a somewhat indeterminate but objec- tive basis in the diverse stimuli of the absolute given. In more Peircian terms, the First category is applicable to being (1.487). We have seen then that in untangling the strands which enter into a pragmatic concept of the given or qualitative immediacy several points have emerged concerning both the method and the content of a metaphysical position. We have seen that the method of metaphysics must be metaphorical and that the intended meaning of Peirce's metaphorical state- ments can best be understood by relating them to some ana- logue to be found in his analysis of perceptual experience. Concerning the content of the metaphysical position, we have seen that the applicability of the First category to being indi- cates that metaphysical reality is qualitatively rich, but that its qualitative richness indicates not a realm of sense univer- sals or any sort of determinate repeatables but rather a realm of diverse and somewhat indefinite qualitative stimuli. This latter statement, however, leads directly to the first of two additional points implicit in the above analysis. The experience of Firstness has been seen to be an analytic aspect of all perceptual experience rather than one kind of 92</page><page sequence="20">A Pragmatic Concept of "The Given" perceptual experience. Thus, in an analogous manner, it may be that Firstness as "applicable to being" indicates an analytic aspect of all being rather than a distinct "realm" of being. The strength of such a speculative hypothesis, however, could be determined only after a detailed examination of the role of Secondness and Thirdness in Peirce's theory of perception and an evaluation of the intelligibility of the metaphysical position which emerges when the interrelation of his three metaphysical categories are interpreted as analogous to the interaction of the three categories as found in the analysis of perceptual experience. As a final and less speculative point, it should be noted that two distinct concepts of reality have emerged from the pres- ent paper, the reality with which perception begins and the reality with which it ends; that is, the metaphysical reality or concrete flux which, in the present epistemological discussion has been at times called the absolute given, and the categor- ized reality with its known objective properties, a reality which can best be termed "epistemological reality" since it is the "end product" of the interpretive perceptual process in which the relative given is first "taken" from the absolute given and then "informed" with predictive meanings. Thus, reality for Peirce is both that which is independent of what anybody may think (5.405) and that which will be the object represented in the ultimate opinion of mankind (5.407). And analogously for Lewis, the absolute given is a continuous real' duration or concrete flux,19 while the "problem of reality" is the problem of the conceptualization or categorization of experience (MWO, pp. 10-14). These two distinct but com- plementary concepts of reality - one metaphysical, the other epistemological - which emerge from an analysis of the prag- matic concept of the given implicit in the writings of Peirce and Lewis reemphasize the point with which the present essay began. A pragmatic concept of the given, unlike the prag- matic theory of meaning, provides an important link between epistemology and metaphysics and thus points to the possibil- 93</page><page sequence="21">Transactions of the Charles S.

It can hardly be doubted that Lewis was influenced by Peirce's writings in the period before Mind and World Order was published. He was in charge of the unpublished Peirce papers and did much reading and preliminary sorting in the early twenties. There is no evidence of which the present author is aware, however, to establish in detail exactly what influences from what writings affected him. 4.

As Peirce states elsewhere, what he intends can best be expressed by the term "prescission (2.428)." Furthermore, in this lat- ter passage Peirce stresses that the process of precision is not that by which we obtain, for example, the abstract concept, whiteness, but rather that by which we are able to grasp a white appearance gen- erally or, in other terms, to recognize a quale as an instance of a kind. 14.
