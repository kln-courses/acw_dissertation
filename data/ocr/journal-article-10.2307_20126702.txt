Carnap Schopenhauer liked to jest at Kant's expense that while he spoke endlessly about the given, he neglected to say what it is. To empiricists an elusive given is no laughing matter ; for if experi ence or sensation is the touchstone of knowledge, an elusive given implies either that knowledge is unstable or that empiricism is false. The empiricist bent of philosophy of science and epistemology over the past four decades has recently been challenged, partly by arguments that exploit the uncertainty about what precisely the given is. It is claimed that this uncertainty stems from the fact that all observation is theory-laden; different "enities" are said to be observed as the theory constituting them is varied. Observa tions therefore do not test theories. So-called tests are really circular arguments, if they confirm the theory, or question-begging, if they disconfirm it. Such is roughly the line of argument ad vanced by the new philosophy of science. Responses to this criticism show a tendency to grant the premise that observation is theory-dependent, but to deny the conclusion that there is no neutral observation language. Karl Popper, for example, concedes to Thomas Kuhn that observation is dependent upon a theoretical framework, but denies Kuhn's "relativist" conclusion on the ground that frameworks can be changed at will.1 In his monumental study of the results of work in the philosophy of science, Wolfgang Stegm?ller discards, as a mere "prejudice," the empiricist belief that there are facts in dependent of language. After an exhaustive review of the litera ture, he reluctantly but firmly concludes that a cardinal tenet of 1 Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, ed. by Imre Lakatos &amp; Alan Musgrave (Cambridge, 1970), p. 56.</page><page sequence="2">624 HIRAM CAT?N modern empiricism, the criterion of cognitive meaning, is itself cognitively meaningless; from the beginning it was a concealed value judgment, or as Stegm?ller prefers to say, an "existential decision' ' to be reasonable?and it is upon such a decision that the remnant of Stegm?ller 's empiricism rests.2 Against the new phi losophy of science Herbert Feigl argues that the thousands of stable empirical laws constitute the rock bottom of experience against which theories are tested. Still, he grants that at least some empirical laws are theory-laden, and that in any case their valid ity depends on induction, whose logic, if any, is mysterious. The justification of theories therefore requires the "virtuous circle" in which "postulates justify the observation propositions and vice versa." 3 The participants in this controversy have styled it a " revolu tion," for the rebels have attacked what is perhaps the funda mental principle of the empiricism hammered out by the Vienna Circle and propagated as logical positivism and logical empiricism. That empiricism rested upon an interpretation of the relation be tween theory and experience or "facts." Theory was held to require justification before the tribunal of experience ; for theories come and go, whereas experience is "given," cannot be argued away, and thus provides the criterion for distinguishing between science and merely arbitrary constructions, such as metaphysics. These were the simple, seemingly self-evident truths of a move ment which became an authoritative voice in contemporary phi losophy and whose influence extended into many disciplines. To day that voice speaks equivocally. This is not merely because there has been a revolt against empiricism, but because the revolt coincided with the whispered admission by empiricists that the basic tenets of empiricism cannot be formulated in a consistent way.4 The reason is that after decades of reflection upon their 2 Wolfgang Stegm?ller, Theorie und Erfahrung (Berlin, 1970), pp. 15t, p. 370. 3 Herbert Feigl, "Empiricism at Bay?"

When Popper asserts that observation depends upon a conceptual framework, and Steg m?ller that facts do not exist independently of their mode of ex pression, they differ only in attitude from the rebel Paul Feyera bend when he declares that "there are no 'bare facts' at all but the facts that enter our knowledge are already viewed in a certain way and are therefore essentially ideational." ? If this is so, the dichotomy between theory and observation, experience, or facts must be discarded, as Feyerabend advises, or reinterpreted as perhaps a distinction between two levels of theory. Some such reinterpretation, in any event, is implied by Feigl's rehabilitation of the vicious circle. The current debate in philosophy of science is the most recent episode in the oscillation between empiricism and idealism that characterizes epistemology since Descartes. Historically as well as in the current debate, empiricists and idealists have tended to divide into opposing camps, each believing that they defend an identifiable territory against the other. But the development of logical empiricism belies this appraisal of the controversy, if it is true, as we have briefly indicated, that through internal self criticism logical empiricism develops into idealism, parallelling in that respect the movement from Hume to Kant. The question then arises whether it is possible to locate the dialectical nodes that keep modern epistemology in a condition of continuous transition back and forth between empiricism and idealism. That question is the horizon for the more limited objective of the present essay, which is to exhibit the empiricism-idealism antithesis in Carnap's writings through the Aufbau. We style these writings his "first philosophy" not only because of the change of orientation which occurred between the Aufbau and The Logical Syntax of Language, but above all because sometime around 1930 the sensi In 1956, Feigl noted general agreement that observation is theory-laden and that consequently the distinction between observation language and theoretical language is seriously questioned; and this, he said, was "of the greatest significance."

IV, p. 20.</page><page sequence="4">626 HIRAM CAT?N tivity to the antithesis which had nourished Carnap's early work withered and hardened into an attitude of dogmatic empiricism and anti-metaphysics. The significance of this change, which to be sure was not a sudden conversion, is this : Carnap was able to harden his position only by shutting his eyes to the critique of empiricism which animated his early thought. For three decades he, with his colleagues and students, labored to give a precise rendering of logical empiricism, only to rediscover through those very labors the idealist objections that he had cast aside. Owing to forgetfulness of this kind, philosophical history of philosophy is necessary for an adequate grasp of the issues. Without it we are not likely to recognize in the latest innovation a repetition of the old dilemmas. In his Intellectual Autobiography, Carnap wrote of the prob lems of empiricism as they appeared after three decades of re search. The Vienna Circle, he said, assumed that there was a certain rock bottom of knowledge, the knowledge of the immediately given, which was indubitable. Every other kind of knowledge was supposed to be firmly supported by this basis and therefore likewise decidable with certainty. This was the picture which I had given in the Logischer Aufbau . . . looking back at this view from our present position, I must admit that it was difficult to reconcile with certain other conceptions which we had at that time, especially in the methodology of science.6 This is a classic statement of the "phenomenalist" phase of logi cal empiricism. All knowledge begins and ends with a passively apprehended given, which however is not facts or objects, but the immediately given. This was the "official" interpretation of the basis of logical empiricism around 1930. It is set forth in the manifesto Scientific World-Conception: The Vienna Circle (1929) and in the article by Blumberg and Feigl (1931) which introduced logical empiricism to the United States. The latter wrote that logical positivism feels that it has shown that all so-called inferred entities?be they tables, atoms, or other minds?are to be constructed purely logically from experience . . . logical positivists hold that the propositions of the empirical sciences can be completely translated? and this, again, is their justification?into a series of propositions containing only terms designating the given.7 6 Carnap, p. 57.</page><page sequence="5">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 627 I emphasize that phenomenalism was the official interpreta tion of the given because considerations will be introduced which make one doubt whether the Vienna Circle, especially Carnap, were ever phenomenalists in this sense except in their program matic statements. According to official history, phenomenalism was in trouble by 1933, when Carnap and Neurath debated the merits of phenomenalism and physicalism in Erkenntnis. The debate underscored the extraordinary fact that the given, sup posedly the indubitable rock bottom of knowledge, was not given with sufficient clarity and distinctness to enable empirically disposed thinkers to reach agreement about it, as Carnap ad mitted, i i There is no agreement about what the given is. " 8 The debate about the given was relinquished under Carnap's "prin ciple of tolerance" according to which phenomenalist and physi calist languages were regarded as necessary for different purposes. Terms such as "fact," "observation," and "experience" were afterward invoked as if they were something different from and probative of laws and theory, but the proof of this cardinal em piricist tenet was the thing sacrificed with abandonment of the inquiry into the given. The subsequent career of logical em piricism was thus an extended begging of this fundamental ques tion. The seeds of the subsequent revisions of logical empiricism were already contained, as Carnap indicated, in certain method ological assumptions that were entertained at the time and which proved to be more compelling than the notion of a rock bottom given. Before examining these assumptions, it may be helpful, 7 Albert E. Blumberg and Herbert Feigl, "Logical Positivism: A New Movement in European Philosophy," Journal of Philosophy, 28 (1931), p. 295. 8 "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through the Logical Analysis of Language," in Logical Positivism, ed. by A. J. Ayer (Glencoe, 1959), p. 63. The title of this celebrated essay is mistranslated; "elimination" should be replaced by ' ' overcoming. ' ' The point is worth noting because Heideg ger, in his reply to Carnap (Was ist Metaphysik?, Einleitung), adopted Carnap's term to characterize his own attitude toward metaphysics. This is but one of many points of convergence between two positions which seem to many to be total opposites.</page><page sequence="6">628 HIRAM CAT?N for purposes of orientation, to look ahead by considering an in consistency in the initial programmatic statement of logical empiricism which shows in bold relief the tension between idealism and empiricism, between thought ("logic") and experience. Blumberg and Feigl, we noted, maintained that science was reducible to propositions containing empirical terms exclusively. This extreme program was meant to relieve an extreme tension between science and experience. The tension, which constituted the central problematic of Carnap's first philosophy, was given a lapidary formulation by Schlick, which Blumberg and Feigl re produced. A distinction is to be made between knowledge (Er kenntnis) and experience (Erlebnis). Experience is wholly pri vate, and propositions containing terms designating immediate experience are not "propositions in the strict sense."9 Science is not about these experiences, but about structural relations ob taining between them. Knowledge (science) is of structure only, and contains not so much as a reference to the egocentricity of the immediate experiences: it is a logic of relations which abstracts from the relata. The formal inconsistency between these two statements is that if science is about relations obtaining between experiences, it is irreducible to propositions containing terms designating only experiences. We turn now to Carnap's discussion of the methodological conceptions which were incompatible with the assumption that the given is probative of knowledge. The conceptions were that natural laws are hypothetical and that scientific theories are axio matic systems connected with observation through coordinating definitions. The hypothetical character of natural laws implies that complete verification is unattainable and that therefore "every other kind of knowledge" is not decidable with certainty, as he notes. (In the career of empiricism, recognition of this difficulty led to abandonment of the "quest for certainty.") Carnap did not comment on the inconsistency between the idea of the given and the axiomatic conception of scientific theories. From recent discussions in philosophy of science it transpires that one route to the thesis of the incommensurability of theories is through 9 Blumberg and Feigl, op. cit., p. 286.</page><page sequence="7">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 629 reflection upon the relation between axiomatics and experience. In his first philosophy, Carnap maintained this position himself. In the essay "On the Task of Physics" (1932), he stated the general problem of empiricism and boldly attempted to solve it. Since this essay remains untranslated, his entire statement will be given : After a long period during which the sources of physical knowledge have been hotly contested, it may perhaps finally be said that pure empiricism has lost its dominance. That the structure of physics cannot be supported by experimental results alone, but must apply non-experimental postulates, has long since been declared by philos ophy. Still, solutions satisfactory to physicists themselves appeared only after exact scientists began to investigate the nature of physical method, and arrived at non-empirical conceptions. [Henri] Poincar? and [Hugo] Dingier above all arrived at the most important results. We take their principles as our point of departure, but apply them more generally than has been done hitherto. In that way we find an answer to the question about the achievement of physics?an answer which enables us to know which logical relations obtain between seemingly inconsistent physical theories, and on what assumptions a decision between them is possible.10 Carnap views the controversy about the sources of knowledge from an historical perspective which lends his appraisal a sense of finality. Pure empiricism is dead. Philosophers?the Kantians especially?have long since "declared" this to be the case. But Kant's arguments against empiricism were burdened with the a priori, which the empiricists attacked and which was rendered untenable by the discovery of non-Euclidian geometry and other advances in science. Post-Kantian empiricism was represented in Germany by men such as Avenarius, Mach, and Ostwald. Their pure empiricism proved in turn to be irreconcilable with science. It led the Nobel laureate in chemistry, Ostwald, to deny the existence of atoms until in 1912 the evidence of atomic theory compelled him to recant. In the meantime Poincar? and Dingier had explained to Carnap's satisfaction how conceptual frame works and mathematical structure operate in science. For Kant's unchanging a priori they substituted another a priori compatible with scientific change, viz., substantive and logical conventions 10 "?ber die Aufgabe der Physik," Kantstudien, 28 (1923), p. 90. Henceforth cited as "Aufgabe."</page><page sequence="8">630 HIRAM CAT?N governing the construction of physics : The principal thesis of the conventionalism advanced by Poincar? and developed by Dingier asserts that the construction of physics requires stipulations (Festsetzungen) that rest on free choice. It follows that those contents of physical statements which depend upon stipulations can be neither confirmed (best?tigt) nor refuted.11 In the nature of the case, the importance of conventionalism depends upon the extent of the stipulations required by physics. They go quite far. In addition to the geometry of space and causality, Carnap mentions rigid bodies, simultaneity, equidis tance, and other common concepts as being dependent upon con ventions. The result is that theories cannot be judged according to the "realistic notion" that the axioms of physics correspond to reality. Axiom systems, he maintains, are neither true nor false because they have no observational content. To become empir ically relevant, coordinating definitions are required to relate the formal determinations of the axioms to perceived contents. But even a theory that has taken on the empirical flesh cannot be said to be true or false. The actual meaning of statements to the effect that theory T1 corresponds to observations whereas T2 does not is that in using T2 "the perceptual content of these observa tions must be coordinated with physical processes of a much more complex structure than in using Tx." 12 That is, since any given observation set 0S can be explained by n theories, the only way of judging between them is the simplicity criterion.13 But since simplicity is a subjective criterion, theories selected in that way cannot be said to be true. Yet if theories are objectively undecid able, Carnap believed that he had shown that the choice of theories can be regulated by the simplicity criterion in a threefold applica tion. He concluded his essay with the proud declaration that he had shown that decisions must be taken and which criteria employed in order to withdraw the appraisal of physical theories (and especially the choice of one among many) from the region of scientific instinct, which hitherto has alone governed [these matters], and place it under the rule of conscious principles of Wissenschaftslehre.1* 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid., p. 106. 13 Ibid., pp. 93-97. 14 Ibid., p. 99.</page><page sequence="9">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 631 In his Intellectual Autobiography, Carnap mentioned the con ventionalism of his early writings only in passing, almost as a confession of a youthful indiscretion.15 Burrowing behind this term, one discovers how up-to-date these early disavowed writings are : Carnap anticipated by four decades the thesis of the incom mensurability of scientific theories. This discovery remains a his torical curiosity unless one recognizes that the emergence of this thesis in recent years and in Carnap's first philosophy are con trolled by the same reasoning. For Carnap's first philosophy was not empiricist, but arose explicitly and consciously as a cri tique of the latest empiricism, i.e., Machian positivism. This has been forgotten by official history, which records only a phenomenalist phase of positivism, treating phenomenalism as though it were but a radical empiricism. In that way the funda mental problems of conventionalism, phenomenalism, and the constructionist program of the Aufbau are obscured. But since logical empiricism is an actual product of its beginnings, it is also driven by concern with the initial fundamental problem, as it is in the form of the problem of the status of theoretical objects, or in general, in its concern with the relation between theory and ex perience. The initial formulation of this problem, based on the distinction between knowledge (Erkenntnis) and experience (Erlebnis), is superior to later formulations insofar as it recog nizes a hiatus between science and experience which puts not science ("theory") but experience into question. In Carnap's first philosophy, my experiences are considered to be mine alone in that they differ from those of others and because they are not intersubjectively accessible. Scientific objects are on the other hand constituted as uniform and intersubjectively accessible ; and scientific statements never refer either to the perceiver or to the content of subjective experience.16 Observations, in short, are independent of the subjectivity of the particular observer. The hiatus between immediate experience and scientific observation is due to what might be styled the anti-empiricism of science which arises from its constructive, mathematical character, as Carnap 15 Carnap, p. 15. 1QBer logische Aufbau der Welt (Berlin-Schlactensee, 1928), ?16. Henceforth cited as "Aufbau."</page><page sequence="10">632 HIRAM CAT?N emphasized: " [physics] constructs a world free of sensible quali ties, in which there are only space and time magnitudes and cer tain non-sensible state magnitudes."17 Indeed the purest forms of physical space and time have "nothing in common" with the sensible, intuitive qualities of space and time, since the former are exclusively quantitative determinations. The hiatus between sci ence and experience is due therefore to the theory of the sub jectivity of sense qualities, owing to which the content of im mediate experience is deprived of its "veracity." 18 The question then becomes: of what relevance is experience to science and in what sense is science anchored in it? Carnap's first philosophy attempts to answer these questions by specifying the sense in which science is "constructed" from experience or the given. Let us consider the manner in which this problem was de veloped in the "Three-Dimensionality of Space and Causality" (1924). In this essay Carnap distinguished two sorts of ex perience or "worlds." The "secondary world" is the familiar world of ordinary experience, commonly believed to be the given. It comes outfitted with things and attributes, causality, three dimensional space, and sense qualities. Science takes its beginning from this world, but transforms it utterly. And yet the secondary world is already a transformation of the "primary world" of the given. The transformation occurs through largely unconscious construction generated by the synthesizing function of thought operating on the given. It consists of a "great number of fic tions," that is, arbitrary constructions; Carnap mentions, but does not assert, that the construction may be guided by Mach's economy of thought principle. The given, by contrast, consists in the un interpreted content of sensations, which is, generally speaking, a temporal series of momentary experiences in two-dimensional space, which exhibit neither thing-attribute relations nor regu larity (Gesetzm?ssigkeit). The argument of the essay is that the three-dimensionality of space is a fictional extension of two dimensional (given) space, the extension being a logical con sequence of regularity or causality, which is itself a fiction.19 17"Dreidimensionalit?t des Raumes und Kausalit?t," Annalen der Philosophie und philosophischen Kritik, 4 (1924), p. 107; Aufbau, ?? 12, 16, 136. Aufbau, ?? I?, 66, 132-36. 19 "Dreidimensionalst," p. 106.</page><page sequence="11">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 633 Carnap took the fictional interpretation of ordinary experi ence for granted as a received view. He mentions that the ordin ary concept of causality, with its idea of an active will as the cause of effects, has long since been exposed as an anthropomorphism and replaced by the notion of functional relations. He believes that the fictional character of three-dimensional space and of regularity can be recognized "without difficulty." He locates the importance and novelty of his thesis in the connection he establishes between the two fictions. Our interest in the essay, however, is not primarily in its thesis but in the method by which Carnap distinguishes the given from constructed experience. He does not state clearly and in a straight forward manner what that method is, in part because of his sensitivity to the difficulties of making it seem cogent. The neo-Kantians maintained against the positivists that the primary world is an abstraction, whereas Carnap holds with the positivists that it is actually ex perienced, i.e., it has a phenomenological basis.20 Even so, this experience is at best fleeting and fragmentary just because we occupy the standpoint of the secondary world. The attribution of any feature to the primary world must therefore always be justified before the tribunal of the secondary world, which forces one to defend his attributions or phenomenological descriptions by recourse to experience and arguments drawn from the second ary world.21 For these reasons phenomenological description plays but a minor role in the essay. The principal phenomenological evidence for the absence of regularity in the primary world is sense deception. Carnap's brief comments upon it suggest the following line of thought. The characterization of some sense experience as deceptive or illusory is a way of making experiences which do not fit customary ex pectations and laws nevertheless fit another familiar category? the category of misfits. The misfits are the traces left in the secondary world by the primitive lawlessness of the first. Carnap gives a general description of the lawlessness of vision, (a) The elements in the fields of vision do not determine one another, that is, a given point p in either field remains undetermined no matter how many other points px are simultaneously determined, (b) 20 Ibid., pp. 108-09. 21 Ibid., p. 125.</page><page sequence="12">634 HIRAM CAT?N No point or set of points in the fields of vision determine any successive point or set of points, that is, any color may be followed by any other, (c) Therefore, the "most important region" of the primary world exhibits no order in the temporal series of succes sive visual points.22 If we add to this the critique of the ordinary (cause-effect) concept of causality, and the clear grasp of its scientific replacement as a mathematical construct, Carnap's case is complete. No doubt this argument falls somewhat short of ineluctable proof. But that does not concern us so much as the manner of the argument, which shows a marked bias toward vision. Not only are the other senses dismissed with a two sentence summary, Carnap avows the bias and defends it on the ground that vision is the most important sense for world-perception.23 We notice fur ther that the description of the visual field as an array of color points is unusual phenomenology. Surely this is not how the visual field looks, as Carnap knew, since he emphasizes that in the secondary world we see mainly things and their attributes. Color points are reminiscent of the physiological properties of the retina, whose point-sets of receptors are activated when struck by point-sets of light rays. If this is what Carnap had in mind, then his phenomenology of primary world sight would have been obtained by reasoning from the structural properties of the eye to the perceptual properties of the uninterpreted visual given. Such, in any event, is certainly the case with his phenomen ology of spatial vision, of which he writes : The totality of visual impressions are arrayed first in a temporal series of momentary experiences. Every momentary experience con sists of two classes of spatially arrayed color sensations [in the two] fields of vision. Each field of vision has roughly the form of a mosaic?it is planar; its dimensional number is therefore easily de termined ... as two.24 He continues : That the field of vision is a plane is certainly not necessarily in con sciousness prior to reflection . . . 'Solid vision', the perception of the depth of things, does not belong to [primary experience], but is an interpretation, and indeed of a fairly complex sort. 22 Ibid., p. 123. 23 Ibid., pp. 109, 123, 124, 126. 24 Ibid., p. 113.</page><page sequence="13">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 635 The visual given is two-dimensional. The phenomenological evi dence for this contention is the amorphous vision of those who recover sight after a lifetime of blindness, or even the acquired capacity of artists to see the visual field as patches of color.25 But this evidence does not impress Carnap so much as the optical account of depth perception, which is, briefly, that for monocular vision the chief cue for depth is overlay, whereas in binocular vision the cues are given by very small deviations from congru ence in the images of the two fields of vision, as is illustrated by the stereoscope. This argument shows that Carnap establishes the features of the given by application of the physical and physiological analysis of sensation, especially of vision, to ordinary experience. His statement that the primary world is actually experienced is therefore wrongly interpreted if it is taken to mean, as it usually was among positivists, that all the features of the primary world can be experienced. Only fleeting glimpses of the given are given. The synoptic view of it is not given at all but is inferred from the considerations just mentioned. This significant point may per haps be underscored by putting it another way. The given of Carnap's first philosophy?and this includes the Aufbau?is not experienced but is rather a concept explicating what we would ex perience if we were not thinking beings. The given is in no way a rock bottom of knowledge probative of scientific statements. The residue of this outlook?the debris of collapsed empiricism? is to be sure visible in Carnap's terminology, e.g., in a given which proves to be barely given and barely cognizable, and in his labelling science a "single, powerful systematic fiction"26 owing to its remoteness from what empiricists imagined to be the robust reality of experience, although the idealist result of Carnap's in vestigation shows sense experience to be altogether unreal. In general, Carnap's phenomenalism interprets experience from the point of view of scientific inquiry about sense experience, with a view to explicating genetically the epistemic relation between ex perience and scientific knowledge. Consideration of the historical context of Carnap's phe 25 Ibid., p. 109. 26 Ibid., p. 107.</page><page sequence="14">636 HIRAM CAT?N nomenalism helps throw light on its character and function. The literature cited in the Aufbau shows that he was widely read in the physiologically-oriented epistemology of the day. This orien tation became workable owing to advances that had been made in psychophysics. The father of this movement was Helmholtz, whose Physiological Optics and writings on epistemology explored the links between these two subjects and influenced such men as Mach and Schlick. Helmholtz renewed the forgotten tradition of what has been called the optical epistemology of modern philosophy. Descartes originated this tradition with his critique of "sense prejudice" (ordinary experience) on the basis of his physiological optics, which argues, among other things, that depth perception is in ferred by use of the telemetric triangle. Optics throws a bridge across the hiatus separating the world as extension from the perceived world. To be precise, the optical account of vision both defines the separation and bridges it. For the subjectivity of sense qualities, etc., is clearly and distinctly conceived only when mathematically explained by a causal account of the genesis of sensations based upon the interaction of qualityless light and the physiological properties of the eye. Optics thus became the epistemologically probative science. By describing the limits of the epistemically most important sense, it shows what can and cannot be expected from sense evidence, or empiricism. Although light rays, rigid bodies, and other entities of mathematical physics cannot be seen?although, in general, Descartes' "new world" is seen only fragmentarily as bits of fig?rate extension?optics gives an especially convincing proof of its existence by explaining what is seen by reference to just that new mathematical world. The prototype of Carnap's phenomenalism, then, is Cartesian ideas.27 27 On the optical bias of Descartes' philosophy, see H. Caton, The Origin of Subjectivity: An Essay on Descartes (New Haven, 1973), pp. 74-77, 86-88. The Aufbau retains the optical bias of the early essays. One similarity especially deserves mention, namely, in respect to the prob lem of how the data of experience provide access to the mathematically constructed physical world. Descartes argued that there is a topographical isomorphism between the perceived object and the point sources of light on the retina; there is, then, a one-to-one correspondence between the fig?rate extension of the perceived image and the object. Carnap argues for a one-to-one correspondence between the world points of physics and of per ception (Aufbau, ?? 127, 136).</page><page sequence="15">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 637 In the meantime the center span of the Cartesian bridge, rationalist metaphysics, had collapsed under the impact of the progressive working out of the Cartesian principle. The move from the subjectivity of the senses to real being as extension had to be qualified by Kant's critique of metaphysics : the world known to rationalist science is no less perspectival and subject- rather than object-determined than the sensed world. Once the a priori was discared, however, the last bar to radical subjectivity was removed. In polemic with opponents, empiricists ascribed to experience or fact a binding power which it could possess only if experience had ontological status; yet empiricism was anti-meta physical and could not consistently maintain that position. Empi ricism was accordingly forced to withdraw into solipsism, as was the case with Mach,28 or into the historical relativism of Comte, who recognized that what counted as fact depended upon the stage of the progress of science.29 On the other hand there were those who reasoned that if the implicit ontological claim of science to know the world as it is could not be sustained, then science no less than pre-scientific opinion is a "world-view" which is at bottom logically arbitrary despite or even because of its precision. This state of affairs was expressed by the rash of pragmatic and conventionalist interpretations of science which began to find favor among scientists around 1870, and it precipitated what Husserl called the "crisis of the European sciences." Logical positivism arose within this crisis and in some mea sure as a conscious response to it ; but it was also a symptom of it. When the Vienna Circle characterized their position as the ' ' scien tific world-conception" (Weltauffassung), they expressed the critical self-consciousness common to Weltanschauungsphilosophie that the world as world is present to a viewing subject, and not otherwise. At the same time, they were uneasy about this position, and never took it up unequivocally. The philosophic self-con 28 Mach wrote to a correspondent that "sometimes it seems to me that solipsism is the only consistent scientific standpoint" (Erkenntnis, IV, 75). Planck and Einstein noticed and objected to this tendency in positivism. Planck wrote that consistent positivism must deny the "concept and neces sity" of an objective world independent of the scientist (M. Planck, Posi tivismus und reale Aussenwelt, p. 13). 29 A. Comte, Discours sur Vesprit positif (Paris, 1844), p. 43.</page><page sequence="16">638 HIRAM CAT?N sciousness of the fin de si?cle, whose greatest exponent, Nietzsche, was familiar to Schlick and Carnap,30 had explained why the col lapse of "Platonism" (rationalism) implied the relativization and devaluation of science. The Vienna Circle resisted this outcome. They attempted to redeem the scientific world-conception from the relativism of world-views by showing that every other world view was metaphysical or cognitively meaningless. Anti-meta physics thus became the title for logical positivism's attempt to overcome the crisis of the sciences.31 30 The impact of Nietzsche is one of the unexplored sources of the thinking of the Vienna Circle. Otto Neurath acknowledged his influence, but without specifying its character (Le D?veloppement du cercle de Vienne et l'avenir de Vempirisme logique [Paris, 1935], pp. 40, 50). Schlick was impressed by Nietzsche 's epistemological and ethical nihilism, whose power and integrity he acknowledged without agreeing with it. See especially "Vom Sinn des Lebens," Symposion, 4, 1927. In the Aufbau, Carnap cited or quoted the Wille zur Macht at least six times, always favorably; each instance refers to one of Nietzsche's anti-metaphysical sallies. In "The Overcoming of Metaphysics," Carnap approved Nietzsche's under standing of Weltanschauung, i.e., attitudes toward life and their relation to metaphysics. 31 The clearest statements of the problem of metaphysics as a problem of the crisis within science are Phillip Frank's "Was bedeuten die gegen w?rtigen physikalischen Theorien f?r die allgemeine Erkenntnislehre?" and Hans Reichenbach's "Die philosophische Bedeutung der modernen Physik," both of which appeared in volume I of Erkenntnis. In this con text, metaphysics means the doctrines that had been assimilated by scien tists to support and explain the Newtonian world. Anti-metaphysics meant the fictionism, conventionalism, and instrumentalism of Mach, Poincar?, Duhem, and the pragmatista. The decisive issue is whether science is to be understood ontologically, as knowledge of nature, or subjectively, as organization of experience. Carnap's reduction of metaphysics to the mind-body problem and to the realism-idealism problem is a simplification of this larger dispute and cannot be understood apart from it. The other face of metaphysics, which positivists often confused with the preceding, was the Comtean image of it as a halfway station between religion and science; it was metaphysics in this sense that the positivists called "Weltanschauung." One link between these two conceptions was the use that had been made of philosophical theories to defend faith; the posi tivists were particularly sharp in their attacks on Du Bois-Reymond's ignorabimus doctrine that it is impossible to know things as they are, with its implication of an inaccessible Ding an sich. (It is a tart commentary on positivist thinking that Duhem's epistemology was greeted as anti metaphysical, although it leads to exactly the same result. Both Du Bois Reymond and Duhem were devout Catholics.) Easily the most damaging confusion in positivist anti-metaphysics was their position on Weltan schauung, which was held to be an expression of an attitude toward life and toward the world. Discourse expressing such attitudes was said to be emotively but not cognitively significant. Yet the positivists repeatedly</page><page sequence="17">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 639 Because the anti-metaphysical polemic was often directed against authors in whom the positivist had no real interest, its serious purpose is not easy to detect ; nor was it completely clear to the Vienna Circle themselves. Contrary to the appearance created by attacks on straw men, the theoretical intention of anti metaphysics was directed against the crisis within science and scientific philosophy. The criterion of cognitive meaningfulness was a Draconian measure intended to free science from the unten able rationalist metaphysics which had previously been its founda tion, while yet salvaging one fragment of rationalism ("cognitive" meaning) without which the authority of science could not stand. This strategy was designed to refound science, in Carnap's phrase, on a "metaphysically neutral" basis: all ontological claims for science, and therewith all denials of those claims, were to be re jected as empty speech signifying no possible object of experience. This type of anti-metaphysics is present in both the essays we have considered. The reasoning behind it, which Carnap does not actually make explicit, appears to be this. The distinction be tween the primary world of the given and the fictional secondary worlds implies, in the usual meaning of these terms, that only the former is real while the latter are worlds of thought. Such empiricism, rigorously carried through, would lead to the unendur able paradox that daily experience and science are more or less convincing figments of imagination; loosely carried through, it leads to the unscientific empiricism of Mach and Ostwald. Carnap thus noted that in calling the secondary worlds fictions, he did not intend to pronounce judgment on their existence. On the other hand, scientific realism, which asserts that the world known to science is real, is equally untenable ; for since science is an evolv ing, conscious construction, this identification implies either that characterized their position as not resting on doctrines, but on a basic atti tude (Grundeinstellung), the "empirical attitude," which affirms the sci entific method and the integrity of the scientist as the means of orienting not only philosophy, but practical affairs. See Carnap, Aufbau, Preface and "The Overcoming of Metaphysics;" Reichenbach, op. cit., pp. 69-70; Neurath, op. cit., pp. 8, 57; Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung: Der Wiener Kreis (Vienna, 1929), pp. 10, 13, 15, 29-30.

This, it seems, was the crushing dilemma which put Carnap in search of a third position of ontological neutrality. Since the crux of the dilemma as he understood it is the incom mensurability between experience and theory, he attempted to neutralize metaphysics by denying the ontological import of the hiatus. He argued his point as follows : The epistemological (or really metaphysical) question about the reality (Seinsbedeutung) of the two regions [of experience and sci ence] should be entirely set aside. For the solution of our problem it has nothing to contribute. Contrary to a widely received opinion, in physics it is without significance whether one calls, in phenomeno logical-realist terminology, the content of the first region "mere ap pearance" (e.g. the perceived color blue), and that of the second (e.g. the corresponding electromagnetic waves) "real," or conversely, in positivist terminology, calls the first the "real given" and the second "only a conceptual complex of such sensations."32 This is the initial statement of the position developed in the Aufbau. The realist language of physics and the phenomenolog ical language of epistemology are to be retained, but the ontolog ical import of both languages is to be intercepted; mentalist and physicalist languages are to be reintegrated into a new concep tually in which the mind-body problem, the realism-idealism con troversy, and related matters are shown to be pseudo-problems. Carnap's first philosophy cannot be understood apart from a clear grasp of the extraordinary boldness of this attempt to renovate the tradition in which his thinking had its roots ; that is, we can not take the measure of the Aufbau without holding fast to his fundamental intention through the thicket of complexity and in consistency which it generates. This difficulty is especially acute because the new position Carnap attempts to approach tends to obliterate the philosophical self-consciousness whose apprehen sion of problems gave rise to the endeavor. For example, initially the realism-idealism dispute was a vividly real problem to Carnap, but his solution tells him that it was after all a pseudo-problem. That is probably why the later Carnap is an unreliable historian of his own thought; why he later misrepresented his early position and perhaps no longer grasped its roots. The Aufbau spans the 32 "Aufgabe," p. 100; also "Dreidimensionalst," p. 109.</page><page sequence="19">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 641 transition between the two standpoints and therefore is often in conflict with itself on the deepest level. To deal with this problem we shall stress essentials even though it will involve some repetition. The objective of the Aufbau is to set forth the outline of con struction theory (Konstitutionstheorie), the task of which is to derive or construct all concepts from a minimum set of basic concepts.33 The central thesis of construction theory, and at the same time its philosophical purpose, is contained in this task. For if all concepts can in fact be so derived, the result is that all con cepts or objects (for the terms are interchangeable in the Aufbau) are explicated according to their logical genesis, thereby achieving clarity over the entire object domain. In the introductory sections Carnap points out the affinities between his undertaking and those of recent or contemporaneous authors. He notes especially that Mach and Avenarius had made "important suggestions" respecting the reduction of scientific ob jects to the given, and that Bussell's construction of the external world with the help of formal logic was an important antecedent of his own effort.34 These acknowledgements may be noted be cause it is possible to interpret the Aufbau as a continuation of Mach's neutral monism by more sophisticated logical and method ological means ; this approach is indeed fruitful to pursue because it will help bring out the point of conflict with the older positivism which already made itself evident in the early essays previously considered. In the passage on metaphysical neutrality quoted above, Carnap took issue with the positivist position that experience con stitutes the "real given" while science is only a "conceptual com plex of sensations." This statement is a criticism of Mach's neutral monism. Mach treated sensations, phenomenally con sidered, as epistemically prior to the objects of science, but he denied sensations ontological status, as mental appearances, argu ing instead that sensations are neutral with respect to the mind body distinction. This position did not stand up well. The mean ing of his empiricism was clear enough from his intransigent 33 Aufbau, ? 1. 34 Ibid., ? 3.</page><page sequence="20">642 HIRAM CAT?N critique of "fictions" in science which had been mistaken for real entities: Mach effectively reduced the real to the sensible. The talk about the objects of science as complexes of supposedly neutral sensations is therefore an unconvincing attempt to avoid the Berkeleian consequences of pure empiricism. The constructional program parallels neutral monism in several ways. The constructional system is by definition "basis neutral" in that physical objects or (autopsychological) ele mentary experiences may be used as the basic concepts for the construction of all others. Carnap chooses the autopsychological basis because it alone is capable of exhibiting, in addition to a logical-constructive order of concepts, their epistemic order, that is, the logical order of the genesis of knowledge.35 But the epis temic primacy of the autopsychological basis tilts the neutrality of the system into a decided bias. It introduces the subject-object dualism whose destructive consequences Carnap was attempting to overcome. The constructional system indeed is not a vehicle well-adapted to questioning that dualism at its roots. The sys tem's procedure is patterned on deductive systems, in which re sults are obtained from an initial stipulation of axioms, defini tions, and inference rules. This means that philosophical ques tions can be raised and answered only at an advanced stage of analysis.36 But in philosophy as in mathematics, the answers re ceived at that stage are but tautologous implications of the initial stipulation. To illustrate this in the present case : Carnap initially merely asserts that the system basis must be either phys icalist or phenomenalist ; only in the course of the development of the system does it become evident what vast epistemological and metaphysical assumptions guided this choice. Yet these assump tions are never justified. From the point of view of the philo sophical objectives of the system, the outstanding instance of this procedural arbitrariness is the assumption which controls Car nap's thinking about the epistemic primacy of the autopsycholog ical basis. He says that if physical objects were not reducible to sensory qualities, there would be no perceptual indicators for it. Statements about such objects would therefore "be suspended in 35 Ibid., ??54, 64. saIbid., ??9, 64-65, 145.</page><page sequence="21">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 643 the void; in science at least, there would be no room for them. Thus, all physical objects are reducible to psychological ones."37 Since Carnap further stipulates that the criterion for "empirical reality" is constructibility in the system, the empiricist initial as sumptions guarantee the anti-metaphysics of his conclusions. This point bears emphasis : Carnap simply declared, without any sup porting evidence or argument, that physical objects irreducible to sensations are unknowable. In order to support this claim, it would be necessary to open a thorough investigation of the cognitive powers and their relations to objects, which would drive inquiry beyond its epistemological stance and into consideration of the ontological problem. But for the purposes of the construc tional system, Carnap assumed an outcome. The presence of such self-evident empiricism in the Aufbau seems to indicate that Carnap abandoned the critique of empiri cism which animated the ipre-Aufbau essays. But that is not the case. The earlier position is presented intact, standing along side and unreconciled with empiricism. This level of the Aufbau in deed expands, and to some extent radicalizes, the methodological reflection of the early essays. A brief resume of it will suffice for our purposes. From its subjective origin in experience, knowl edge advances to the physical world, a "pure world of numbers." 38 The scientific, especially the optical, explanation of the epistemic value of sensation is retained; and although the old terminology is dropped, Carnap retains the division between the primary world of the given and the secondary worlds of ordinary experience and of science. The material requires closer examination. The given, according to the Aufbau, is never "found," i.e., given as mere "raw material," i.e., qua given, but has already undergone the synthesis of cognition which forms it into "en tities."39 This "intuitively completed construction of reality" (Aufbauen der Wirklichkeit), which had previously been called the world of ordinary experience, sets the task of the constructional system as a rational reconstruction (Nachkonstruktion) of reality: the unconscious construction is to be supplemented by a fully 87 Ibid., ? 57. asIbid., ??2,16,136. ss&gt;Ibid., ??100, 132.</page><page sequence="22">644 HIRAM CAT?N conscious construction of the world according to the order of epistemic primacy. If we understood the steps by which these worlds (or "object types," as the Aufbau usually calls them) may be reached, science would be justified, i.e., the perplexities of dual ist epistemology would be essentially resolved.40 Everything therefore depends upon the nature of the starting point, the given. We previously pointed out that in his later years Carnap characterized the given of the Aufbau positivistically as a rock bottom of knowledge which provided the criterion for judging all other knowledge claims. This view undoubtedly under lies the empiricism of the Aufbau. That empiricism, however, occupies the standpoint of immediate certainty, or reliance upon sense intuition, which is rejected by the other voice of the Aufbau, which says that the allegedly certain sensible intuition is actually an unconscious synthetic construction, and therefore is mediated by thought.41 The given of the Aufbau is stripped even thinner than in the early essays. It has no properties, and cannot be de scribed or analyzed; it can be approached only by "quasi anal ysis," which, Carnap says, is actually synthesis clothed in the language of analysis.42 In this way basic experiences become elements of basic relations, which are the foundation of the system. It follows then that the basis of subsequent constructions is itself constructed. The controlling this reflection seems to be that structure alone is cognizable or rationally comprehensible; but since the given is structureless, it is uncognizable.43 The idealism of the Aufbau, clearly expressed in the title of the work (The Logical Construction of the World), was apparent to Carnap at the time of its composition, although his later ap proval of an inaccurate English translation of the title perhaps indicates that he no longer wished to be associated with it.44 In ?0Ibid., ? 179; for Carnap's uses of "world," see ?? 136, 145. 41 Ibid., ? 100. ?2Ibid., ??68,71,74. 43 Thus Carnap wrote that "the constructional definition is to reflect nothing but the structural, the ordered . . . which alone can be rationally apprehended" (Aufbau, ? 132). (Italics in the original.) Again: "... sci ence deals only with the description of the structural properties of ob jects" (Aufbau, ? 10; also ?? 16, 68-69). 44 It might be thought that the meaning of "Aufbau" is settled by Rolf A. George's English translation, which Carnap presumably approved.</page><page sequence="23">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 645 any case, in the Aufbau he wrote : Constructional theory and transcendental idealism agree in the view that all objects of knowledge are constructed (in idealistic language : 'produced in thought'); indeed, the constructed objects are objects of conceptual knowledge only as logical forms, which are constructed in a definite way. This holds ultimately also of the basic elements of the constructional system.45 This statement might pass as a trenchant summary of the non empiricist reflection of the Aufbau, and as an endorsement of the idealist thesis that the world, insofar as it is intelligible, is a "creation," or a product of the labor of thought: the world as world comes to be through its construction. Since it may be sus pected that such a result must presuppose an unusually perverse interpretation of Carnap's thought, it is perhaps pertinent to summarize the premises from which it follows. The Aufbau's reflection upon the world begins with the problems implicit in the plurality of worlds?the perceptual world, the world of physics, etc. The collision of these world conceptions, we have seen, gen erated the aporiai of modern epistemology which Carnap hoped to solve by setting forth the unity and coherence of these worlds, that is, by grasping the world as world through the constructional But this fact is only a datum in a tangle of ambiguity. The major am biguity stems from the circumstance that "Aufbau" appears only infre quently in the work, the technical term for "construction" being "Kon stitution" and for "structure," "Struktur." Presumably the reason for this is that Carnap was not the author of the German title. Feigl reports (Boston Studies, v. VIII, xii) that Schlick suggested it. But by accepting the suggestion, Carnap made the title his own. Despite all this, it is possi ble to establish "construction" as the proper translation of "Aufbau." It is, in the first instance, the primary dictionary meaning of Aufbau and cognates. Secondly, when Carnap uses "Aufbau," he clearly uses it in this sense (see pp. 3, 13, 22, 88, 91, and especially 139, 249; see also the use of the word in "?ber die Abh?ngigkeit der Eigenschaften des Raumes von denen der Zeit," Kant Studien, 30 (1925), pp. 334, 336-38.) More over, the theme of the work is the constructional system, not structure, however important it may be. The structures with which the work is con cerned are not logical but empirical (mathematical) descriptions belonging to the empirical science, even if Carnap does transform them into logical structures. The world of the Aufbau has no logical structure, since logic says nothing about reality; but the world acquires structure by the con structive, synthesizing function of thought. Finally, I note that Wolfgang Stegm?ller (Boston Studies, v. VIII, lii) and C. G. Hempel (The Legacy of Logical Positivism, ed. by Achinstein &amp; Barker, Baltimore, 1969, 176) translate the title as I do. 45 Aufbau, ? 177.</page><page sequence="24">646 HIRAM CAT?N system. A coherent grasp of the world supposes that it is not the sum of objects, as Carnap emphasized, but that it is derived or logically built up from the primordial experience which is the origin of all world conceptions.46 The foregoing result appears paradoxical because it contra dicts the better-known empiricism of the Aufbau. The passage just cited is drawn from the closing segment of the work, where Carnap attempted to eliminate the metaphysical positions familiar to him, thereby establishing the neutrality of construction theory. Realism, phenomenalism, and idealism are metaphysical because they attempt to affirm or to deny, in one way or another, the in dependence of objects from consciousness.47 For Carnap the de cisive question is whether scientific empiricism requires any of these positions, which he denies. It suffices for the objectivity of science that it establish regularities wThich are independent of the will of the individual; on the other hand, the ascription of the property 'real' to any substance (be it matter, energy, electromagnetic field or whatever) cannot be derived from any experience and hence would be metaphysical.48 This view, which even in the advanced thinking of today enjoys a high degree of self-evidence, forced Carnap into an attack upon language which denies that words mean what they seem to mean ; and in this attack the entire problematic of the Aufbau reappears. After introducing the concept of construction, Carnap maintained that he used the word in a sense neutral between passive appre hension and active production; and throughout the work, realist language, especially the realist language of physics, is treated as a fa?on de parler whose only adequate interpretation is the lan guage of construction theory.49 ^Ibid., ?4. 47 Ibid., ? 176. At times Carnap's anti-metaphysics is indistinguish able from Berkeleian idealism, for example : "Each object which is not itself one of my experiences is a quasi object; I use its name as a convenient abbreviation in order to speak about my experiences. In fact, within con struction theory, and thus within rational science, its name is nothing but an abbreviation. Whether, in addition, it also designates something which ' exists by itself is a question of metaphysics which has no place in sci ence" (Aufbau, ?160). 48 Aufbau, ? 178. ?9Ibid., ?? 5, 52, 178. Feigl (Legacy, p. 19) records that "even dur ing the early period. . . there was the belief that in some way all state ments of science were nothing more than convenient fa?ons de parler about the data of actual and possible observations. ' '</page><page sequence="25">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 647 Construction theory and science might plausibly be said to be neutral with respect to production and apprehension if scientific objectivity were independent of the will, that is, from choices or decisions which constitute reality one way rather than another. But according to the Aufbau, both construction theory and science depend on such decisions. Bespecting science, the Aufbau con tinues to maintain that it depends upon stipulations which fix empirical reality into a quantifiable framework; the thorough as similation of the implications of this view^ in the Aufbau is clear from Carnap's bold identification of concept and object.50 Con struction theory for its part presupposes the corpus of formal logic. Carnap adopted the position according to which logic is not grounded in real or alleged necessities of thought, maintain ing instead that it consisted "solely of conventions concerning the use of symbols. ' '51 This means in effect that the ground of logic is not reason but the will; in particular, the self-conscious will to techn?, which as such excludes the desired neutrality. Carnap therefore cannot, consistent with these premises, claim that objectivity is independent of the will. In any case, it could scarcely be said that asserting (or denying) the independence of objects from consciousness is metaphysical while yet maintaining that independence from the will is metaphysically neutral.52 The attempt to loosen the realist language of physics from its implied ontology is part of a cruel dialectic between science and scientific self-reflection. Speaking as an empiricist, Carnap denied that the property ' ' real' ' can be ascribed to any substance, on the ground that such a predicate cannot be derived from any experience.53 As it stands, this statement is at best an induction incapable of supporting the required iron-clad dichotomy. But this we mention only in passing. The analytical defect of the argument is the assumption that experience is probative of 50 Aufbau, ? 107. 51 Carnap, "Die alte und die neue Logik," Erkenntnis I, p. 25. 52 In fact Carnap did not consistently maintain that existence inde pendent of the will was metaphysically neutral; twice he classified this position too as metaphysical (Aufbau, ?? 16, 136). 53 Aufbau, ? 178. We cannot enter here into the details of Carnap's distinction between empirical and metaphysical reality. It may be men tioned, however, that the criteria for the empirical real (?? 170-71) imply that only cognized reality is empirically real, although Carnap never justi fies the criteria he invokes.</page><page sequence="26">648 HIRAM CAT?N science, whereas science is critical of experience. This criticism, we have seen, is implied by the idea of mathematical physics, and its associated distinction between sense experience and the phys ical (real) constitution of things. Carnap noticed that the dis tinction between appearance and reality carried metaphysics into the heart of science ; and for this reason he was anxious to deny the prevailing opinion that it was essential to science to dis tinguish, e.g., the quality blue as appearance and a corresponding electromagnetic wave as real. This denial is incompatible, how ever, with the fundamentals of Carnap's own thinking, which presupposes that distinction explicitly as a doctrine of modern science.54 Does then the realist language of physics imply that idealism is false? Not at all. Carnap's self-reflection concludes that all objects of knowledge are constructed, so that concept and object are identified. From this point of view, reality is coexten sive with cognized reality. But the attempt to eliminate meta physics would not allow Carnap to acknowledge this consequence of his own thinking. It also could not be acknowledged owing to the central di lemma in logical empiricism around which Carnap's thinking oscillated. The dilemma is the perpetual collision of scientism with empiricism. On the one hand, the logical empiricists affirmed that scientific method and its positive results were the model of knowledge. But their empiricism asserted that immediate ex perience "need[s] no justification and serve [s] as the foundation for all the . . . statements of science. ' '55 The link between these quite distinct theses was the idea that science is a system of state ments based on direct experience, and that accordingly the justi fication of such statements consists in showing their experiential basis.56 However, in each of its successive affirmations of the existence of an intuitively evident, incorrigible given (or "pro tocol" or "observation"), it was compelled in the next breath to retract that claim by admitting that the character of the allegedly indubitable basis was in actual fact controversial. This devastat ing admission was passed over by assurance that settling the 54 Aufbau, ? 133. 55 Carnap, The Unity of Science. Translated by M. Black. (London, 1934), p. 45. Henceforth cited as "Unity," 66 Ibid., pp. 42, 44.</page><page sequence="27">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 649 question was unnecessary "for present purposes," or by taking "observation" as a basic, undefined term, i.e., by leaving the given uninterrogated.57 These manoeuvers successfully evaded the question of principle at stake in the collision of empiricism with science. The controversy over the character of the given?whether it consists of sense data, objects, or whatever?arose from the critique of experience implicit in the qualityless world of mathe matical physics. Carnap's first philosophy, we have seen, made this critique a central theme, and yet he never assimilated the fact that science does not begin with experience but with a critical evaluation of experience. Once this is admitted, the conception of science as a system of statements based on direct experience loses its evidence, and the program of justifying of science by reducing its statements to direct experience proves to be misbegotten. The penalty for persisting in the reductionist conception of science was that the positivist notion of how scientific statements should be empirically justified was profoundly at odds with the actual practice of science. This estrangement reached an extreme form in The Logical Syntax of Language. In order to understand the place of this work in Carnap's development, its continuity and discontinuity with the Aufbau must be appreciated. The most conspicuous break is in the attitude toward epistemology taken in the two works. In the former, Carnap viewed his effort as a continuation of epistemology, if one that for the first time freed it from the metaphysical theses in which it had been entangled.58 But in the Logical Syntax and thereafter, epistemology was rejected, partly because it could not be detached from empirical psychology, but 57 In what is perhaps one of the most remarkable pieces of question begging in the history of philosophy, Carnap undertook to salvage an empiricism which was admittedly tottering by assuming "observable" to be an undefined term in the observation language. See "Testability and Meaning," Philosophy of Science 3 (1936), p. 454 and "The Methodologi cal Character of Theoretical Concepts," in Minnesota Studies in the Phi losophy of Science, v. I, 40-41. The positivist retreat from the given, and its destructive consequences for the empiricist position, have been ob served by a number of authors. John A. Passmore wrote acidly, l ' Carnap is still assuming in The Unity of Science that protocol statements do refer to the given ; we are just not to mention that fact because if we do, we shall find ourselves confronted with insoluble problems" ("Logical Positivism," Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy 21 (1943), p. 81). ** Aufbau, ?? 1,178.</page><page sequence="28">650 HIRAM CAT?N more emphatically because it could not be disentangled from the "morass of subjectivist philosophical problems" that led invari ably to metaphysics.59 The rejection of epistemology was directly linked to the new position, whose thesis was that philosophy should be replaced by the logic of science, which is "nothing other than the logical syntax of the language of science."60 The link between the old and new positions was a change of focus on the problem of meta physics. The Aufbau had identified the mind-body problem and the associated problem of the existence of the external world as the kernel of metaphysics ; but it also noticed that any "essence" ques tion was metaphysical.61 The realist language of science, and in gen eral any realist language, always invites essence questions, since a literal interpretation of its realism implies the existence of "the thing itself ' ' rather than of the quasi objects which construction the ory asserts scientific objects to be " almost without exception.' '62 The constructional system averts the metaphysical seduction of ordi nary language by interpreting its realism in purely formal terms. But in the Logical Syntax, Carnap realized that the Aufbau did not go far enough. Essence questions arise whenever the "ma terial mode of speech" is used, regardless of whether it be in mathematics or empirical science. This problem seems to have been brought to Carnap's attention by philosophical disputes in mathematics and logic regarding the "correct" interpretation of numbers, classes, intensions, etc.63 But whatever the occasion may have been, he stressed that such disputes arose from the mistaken belief that there are objects corresponding to such concepts, whereas in actuality they are "pseudo-objects"?mirages pro duced by the material mode of speech. Such statements are only about linguistic entities. This is brought out by the formal or syntactical mode of speech, for its use requires that one specify the language within which a given statement is to hold. "The use of the material mode of speech leads," in other words, "... to 59 Carnap, The Logical Syntax of Language. Translated by Amethe Smeaton. London, 1937, pp. 279-80, 301-02.

' ' The statement that a thing is a complex of sense-data becomes "every sentence in which a thing-designation occurs is equipollent to a class of sentences in which no thing designations but sense-data designations occur." The decisive point, as Carnap put it in "Testability and Meaning," is that the standpoint of syntax unmasks the pseudo-materiality of the ma terial mode of speech by showing that every philosophical thesis "concerns the structure of language and therefore depends upon a convention, namely the choice of the language structure."66 There is accordingly a profound shift in Carnap's anti-meta physics from the Aufbau to the Logical Syntax. Whereas for merly, philosophical sentences are rejected because they transcend experience, now they are rejected because experience itself is trans cendental, i.e., experience properly understood is the expression "experience." The position of the Logical Syntax thus represents a more radical conventionalism than Carnap had ever adopted, as he seems to have acknowledged when he wrote of his principle of tolerance that "it is not our business to set up prohibitions, but to arrive at conventions."67 The principle of tolerance, based on the view that all statements are relative to a language system, and that language systems are themselves matters of choice, promised to eliminate philosophical disputes from the logic of science by allowing greater freedom for the introduction of primitive con cepts in the language of physics, while at the same time retaining the possibility of distinguishing pseudo-concepts from "real seien 64Ibid., p. 299; also "Testability," pp. 427-31. 65 Syntax, p. 300; Carnap, p. 873. 66 "Testability," p. 430. 67 Syntax, p. 51. This position remained definitive ; see Carnap, pp. 862, 864, and 869.</page><page sequence="30">652 HIRAM CAT?N tifie concepts and sentences."68 The problem for Carnap's new position was whether and how these two desiderata might be combined. He proposed that, for example, study of the nature of space and time be replaced by study of the syntax of space and time co-ordinates. There is, however, no single syntax of space time co-ordinates because space-time relations may be expressed in a variety of systems, none of which is "correct." How then are real scientific concepts to be distinguished from the spurious? Does not the sense of the distinction between real and spurious evaporate when the ontological import of the material mode of speech is dissolved into the linguistic expressions of syntax? Let us attempt to reconstruct the reasoning that led Carnap into this dilemma. He wished to isolate a type of discourse, called "philosoph ical," which makes statements about essences. It is thought to differ specifically from scientific and ordinary discourse in that it requires a point of view higher than or at least common to all empirical discourse: it is metaphysical. Such discourse can be isolated and eliminated because it is extraneous to sound discourse. However, Carnap traced the source of essence questions to the ontological import of ordinary and scientific discourse. It follows then that sound discourse is already corrupt with the original sin of metaphysics. Carnap's illustrations of the dangers of the material mode of speech indeed show that essence questions arise within science and mathematics, and hence that philosophical statements are strictly continuous with sound scientific state ments. An adequate prophylaxis against metaphysics must then proceed on the following premises. All non-syntactical talk is implicitly metaphysical in virtue of the realist import of "ab solute" statements. But this defect of principle in the material mode of speech is harmless except when exploited philosophically. The material mode of speech may therefore be allowed, although the standpoint of syntax views that mode as only a fa?on de parler. If however this principle is conceded, the result is an undiffer entiated relativization of all truth claims to truth-within-a-system. The only spurious concepts and statements it is capable of ex 68 Syntax, p. 322.</page><page sequence="31">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 653 eluding are claims to unconditioned truth, and this characteristic is common to ordinary language, science, and philosophy. The standpoint of syntax is like a fire that devours everything, including itself. The statement that the logic of science reduces to the syntax of the sentences of science is an assertion in the material mode of speech which makes a claim about the character of an important region of reality. It is a philosophical statement. In order to make it conform to principle, it would need to be reformulated as a proposal to interpret the logic of science as the syntax of the sentences of science. To understand what the proposal involves, we must recall that the "logic of science" is Carnap's new term for expurgated epistemology, and that he retains, in syntactical translation, the old program of epistemology as the justification of science by exhibiting the inferential rela tions obtaining between scientific statements and the experiences upon which they are based. The syntactic translation of the old epistemological investigation of experience is "an inquiry into the form of the protocol-sentences and of the consequence relations between the physical sentences . . . and the protocol sentences. "69 This procedure is sensible only if there is a pro tocol for protocol-sentences to describe, but whether or not this is the case is not within the competence of syntax to decide: it is for the physicist to lay down protocol-sentences.70 It may safely be said, however, that no scientist lays down protocol-sentences in the required sense of that term. He does not because what counts as adequate justification or proof within science differs in principle from the positivist meaning of justification. If this were not the case?if the justifications offered by actual science had been satisfactory to the positivists?then they would never have perceived a need to offer a "philosophical" justification to back up, as it were, the scientific justifications of scientific state ments. The difference in principle is that philosophers sought generality; they sought to lay hold of the "logic" implicit in all scientific justification. The attempt to articulate that logic led to the characteristic tenets of logical positivism, and especially to the effort to justify science in a way completely foreign to actual 69 Ibid., p. 323. "Ibid., p. 317.</page><page sequence="32">654 HIRAM CAT?N science?by reducing scientific statements to equivalent expres sions about the given. This undertaking is in effect abandoned in the Logical Syntax, not only because experience is no longer accessible to the standpoint of syntax, but also because Carnap recognized, once again, that observations do not univocally deter mine scientific laws. The movement from observation to law is by way of "so-called induction," which Carnap said was not a logical or deductive procedure. Laws and hypotheses cannot, therefore, be verified, as he had previously maintained, but rather are confirmed to the degree that the logical consequences of the hypothesis accord with accepted observations. But even here there are limits. A hypothesis cannot "in the strict sense" be refuted because it is always possible to renounce the observations which are contrary to it.71 These reflections led Carnap back to his fundamental conception of the system as the framework of significant speech. Inferential relations between hypotheses and observations can be established only within the context of a sys tem of statements; but the construction of such systems is "not effected in accordance with fixed rules, but by means of conven tions" that constantly change with the advance of science.72 These views, which are standard ammunition in current at tacks on positivist philosophy of science, seem to be incompatible with the idea of "the logic of science," since they assert in effect that science is not logical. It moves in mysterious ways, combin ing the rigor of deduction with the logically inscrutable ways of invention and creation. Owing to the alogicality of science, it is not possible, "in the strict sense," i.e., by deduction, to refute or verify hypotheses. Recognition of all this should have provided Carnap sufficient reason for questioning the adequacy of a formal approach to science, in particular, the adequacy of syntax ; instead he went on, in "Testability and Meaning," to search for "the" "logic" of test and confirmation. The Vienna Circle expected that their reorientation of philos ophy would result in close cooperation between philosophers and scientists. That expectation has been disappointed. It has been frequently remarked that the philosophy of science interests but 71 Ibid., pp. 317-18, 320. 72 Ibid., p. 320.</page><page sequence="33">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 655 few scientists and hardly exercises any influence upon science.73 The revolt against positivist philosophy of science arose partly from the disparity between the rule-book science of positivist canon, which stipulates the justificatory Ought, and what actually happens in science, where one discovers that every rule has been and should have been broken at some time.74 The positivist search for "the logic" of science was actually a search for an unchange able and enduring structure?for the "essence" of science. But science is the evolving discipline par excellence; evolving not only in the wealth of new results, but in its methods and in the un expected problems it discovers. Since this is true of logic as well, whatever logic of science that might be discovered could only be provisional upon the next advances in logic. Apart from the incapacity of positivism to execute success fully its program, two things have steered the philosophy of science into new paths. One of them, which we have called the alogicality of science, is better expressed by remarking that by adopting the standpoint of formal logic, positivists wedded their enterprise to a hopelessly impoverished conception of ration ality; for to identify, tacitly or explicitly, the logical with the rational is to maintain that the only strictly rational justification of science is a transformation of tautologies, although the institu tion of logic is said to depend not on reason but arbitrary choice, i.e., will. One may put the matter this way : the positivist manner of distinguishing philosophy from science guaranteed that the analytic statements of the former would never be able to justify the synthetic statements of the latter. Positivism confronted this difficulty as the problem of induction, namely, whether and how induction might be governed by formal rules. The failure of the concentrated and ingenious efforts to discover such rules has led the new philosophy of science to conclude that the "logic of in duction," the key to scientific reasoning and justification, lies in context, which, roughly, is the state of science at a given time. Consonant with this insight, the new philosophy of science re 73 Ern?n McMullin, "Recent Work in the Philosophy of Science," New Scholasticism 40 (1966), pp. 483, 486. 74 Feyerabend, op. cit., pp. 18, 20, 21. Toulmin, Kuhn, Hanson, and sometimes Popper have advanced similar views.</page><page sequence="34">656 HIRAM CAT?N places logicist essentialism with empiricism?with the study of actual science. But since actual science changes, the new orienta tion replaces essentialism with the study of the history of science. Ernan McMullin summarized this development in 1966 : More and more it is coming to be seen that philosophy of science cannot be successfully carried on by logical analyses of the science of one period, whether our own or any other. The all-important dimension of time will be missing, and thus one will miss not only the problems of discovery but also the real problems of confirmation. To put this another way, the philosophy of science is an essentially historical undertaking, and the failure of logical empiricists to see this has greatly impoverished American philosophy of science in the past.75 To declare that the philosophy of science is essentially historical, or even in major part historical, is to abandon entirely the stand point of logical empiricism. The significance of history is not exhausted by the fact that it supplies the context in which the scientist's justification of his theories can be understood. History in this sense is perhaps extrinsic to science, if indispensable to the philosopher of science. But history is intrinsic to science insofar as science is progressive. No doubt the historicity of science is not conspicuous in the quotidian routine of research ; but it is ever-present in the method ological principles which guide research and its interpretation. It comes to light spectacularly when a discipline undergoes a con ceptual revolution which, as scientists are wont to say, completely renovates their understanding of a field. In these moments, the "ontology" of the field is superseded by another. To be sure, just as the man in the street eventually learns to think of life transformed by a deep political revolution as somehow natural, so the man in the laboratory quickly reconciles the new ontology with his native metaphysical realism. But at the higher level of scientific self-consciousness and methodological sophistication, the realist metaphysic, which happily deems all but the present ontology to be false, is replaced by awareness that the present ontology too is false, not merely because it may be superceded, but because the entities of science are certainly constituted by creative theoretical constructions. The historicity of science 75 McMullin, op. cit., pp. 503-04.</page><page sequence="35">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 657 grounds, therefore?not only in the progressive process, but in the source of that process?awareness of the constructional character of scientific conceptuality. At this level, it is possible to declare, with Karl Popper, that scientific theories are "chapters in the history of ideas" and that the scientific tradition is a tradi tion of "critical myth-making;" 76 or with Henry Margenau that "if the history of science teaches anything at all it is that there are no eternal verities which man can grasp and hold forever. ' '77 Logical empiricists, Carnap in particular, presupposed Mar genau's fundamental historicist premise. If they spoke of nature at all, the term was placed in quotation marks to indicate that nature is an objectification of subjective experience; and they denied the significance of speech about the real objects to which theory is popularly believed to refer. But this attempt to under write the absoluteness of an objectivity without objects depended upon absolutizing conventionalism, and conventionalism expressed consciousness of the constructive character of science. Carnap's conventionalism transforms itself into historicism once the his torical basis of the presently reigning conventions is recognized. The transition is possible because conventionalism and historicism share the common premise that there are no eternal verities, or, what comes to the same thing, that the real world is the cognized world. But whereas conventionalism relates the making of con ventions to arbitrary choice, historicism recognizes a succession of cognized worlds, i.e., "world-views," whose intelligibility it seeks to bring to light by investigating that succession, without, however, denying the irreducible arational or creative element which conventionalism leaves uninterrogated as "choice." 78 76 Conjectures and Refutations (London, 1963), pp. 379 and 127. 77 Mind and Cosmos: Essays in Contemporary Science and Philos ophy, edited by Robert G.

His distinction between the world of ordinary experience and the world of science was meant to orient epistemology by emphasizing the radical dis junction of these two worlds while at the same time stressing that the new world of science arises by reflection upon the world of ordinary experience. The distinction in effect outlines a program for the philosophy of science, which Carnap attempted to carry out as a rational reconstruction of the world from the materials of the given. The project failed in part because he substituted an uncognizable given for the actual given?the world of ordinary experience. Historicist philosophy of science attempts to occupy this world, and to understand science as chapters in the history of ideas : its account explains the gradual or sudden inversions of ordinary experience by scientific thinking. There is nothing partic ularly new about this procedure, which arose prior to Hegel, which logical positivism opposed in the form of Dilthey's Geisteswis senschaften, and which is practiced today by a number of leading scholars, including philosophers of science. Philosophical history, or to speak perhaps more aptly, philosophy with an historical sense, is indispensable today because the modern world is the result of transformations of the natural world by self-conscious efforts of is actually its disintegration, unleashed a ferocious polemic in hope of covering the king's nakedness. The quality of their argument may be illustrated by one observation. Rudner (Miller, op. cit., p. 832, n. 10) singled out Israel Scheffler's Science and Subjectivity (Indianapolis, 1967) as an "incisive and meticulous" analysis of objectivity and defense of "standard position" philosophy of science against historicist critics. Schefner however states that the liberalization of the criterion of cognitive significance has resulted in its dissolution (p. 6) ; that the attempt to base the objectivity of science on a conceptually "unalterable phenomenal base," i.e., on a given independent of categorizing observation, "breaks down decisively" (p. 35); that objectivity presupposes the "moral im pulse" of responsibility in belief (pp. 4, 5, 7) as well as an "ontological vision" of an independent reality constraining belief (p. 11). As for the nature of that ontological vision, he endorses C. S. Peirce's statement that "the opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who inves tigate is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real" (p. 11). In other words, Hegel and Heidegger are right that being (reality) is a function of the historicity of the subject. Rudner's champion against the historicists is tainted with the iniquity of the enemy. Such thought makes the transition to historicism when it be comes aware of its own premises.</page><page sequence="37">CARNAP'S FIRST PHILOSOPHY 659 thought and practice ; and this is true not only of science and its praxis, technology, but also the sociopolitical world.79 These transformations are essentially historical not merely because they are unique, although they are, but because they are conceived as free and creative attempts to overcome nature, especially the naturally given world of ordinary experience. Within the historicist position it is of course not possible to remove the quotation marks from the word "nature" as we have used it in the preceeding sentences ; for historicism can know only what men think and have thought about nature. But it is an anti dote to a philosophy which has replaced nature by language ; and it is capable of reorienting philosophical inquiry so that nature, and with it philosophia perennis, is once again visible.
