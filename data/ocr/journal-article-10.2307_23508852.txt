<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Nature and Extent of Idolatry in Eighth-Seventh Century Judah Jacob Milgrom University of California at Berkeley Datable biblical texts of the eighth century accuse Israel of idolatry 15 times in contrast to 166 accusations in the seventh century. This lopsided imbalance is ex plicable by assuming thatjehu in Northern Israel andjehoiada in Judah wiped out the Baal cult from the establishment sanctuaries during the ninth century (2 Kings 10:1-2;11:7-18). Archaeological evidence for the distribution of cultic figurines dur ing this period also confirms their virtual absence from these sanctuaries. However, figurines are found in profusion in thejudahite countryside, and especially in the city of David — in the shadow of the Temple — over the eighth to sixth centuries. Thus, the reforms of Hezekiah and Josiah were effective only with establishment sanctuaries but were failures regarding the private, popular cult. Also the prophets of the eighth century did not view private idolatry as a threat to the official worship of of YHWH; hence the paucity of accusations. However the prophets of the seventh century, under the influence of Deuteronomy, demanded eradication of idolatry in all its forms, private as well as public — but to no avail. The Biblical Text This study is grounded in these statistics: The datable biblical literature of the eighth century accuses Israel of idolatry 15 times;1 that of the following seventh century 166 times. These totals break down as follows: H (Lev 19:4; 26:1),26:1), Am0s(5:26),H0sea(5:3b-4;6:10),Isaiah(2:8,18,20;10:11,17:8;27:9; 30:22; 31:7),Micah(1:7; 5:12-133).In the seventh century the citations are too many to itemize; here are the totals for each book: Deuteronomy (36), Jeremiah (46 ), Ezekiel ( 82 ), Zephaniah (1), Habakuk (1). At once I must enter two qualifications. First, these statistics are approxi mate. Admittedly, I have not distinguished between the ipsissima verba of the prophets and those of tradents ( to cite one obvious example — the prose sec tions of Jeremiah). However, even if we could identify the latter and remove (1) For this paper I define idolatry broadly: the worship of all images, notjust of other gods, but also of YHWH. My definition, therefore, covers the first and second commandments of the Decalogue (Exod 20:3-6; Deut 5:7-10, following Philo, Decal. 52-174; Josephus, Ant. 3: 91-92; Sifre Num. 112; b.Sanh. 99a; b.cOr. 8b; see the Addendum, below).</page><page sequence="2">2 JACOB MILCROM [2] them from our count, the total would still increase by adding the seventh century statements in the book of Kings, which most likely underwent an initial preexilic redaction: Indeed, even without a "Josianic"edition, com monly accepted by scholars!' there may even be a"Hezekian"edition4 and a Northern Israel prophetic document? Nevertheless, since there is no consen sus on the extent of this redaction, the book of Kings will be excluded from consideration. The second qualification concerns the book of Hosea. I accept the theory proposed by Kaufmann6and amplified by Ginsberg7 that Hosea 1-3 (hence forth, Hos 1) constituted the work of a ninth century northern prophet. Among the compelling reasons for this distinction, one is especially rele vant for this study. Hos I is replete with accusations of Baal worship, but they are absent from Hos II(chapters 4-14). Hos II either refers to idolatry of the past, the sin of Baal-peor (9:10; 13:1) or "idolatry"of the present, namely, the worship of the golden calves (8:4-6; 13:2) which, as recognized, sym bolize the presence of YHWH, not the Baal. Lastly, the country altar is the scene ofzenût, not idolatry, but literally'fornication,'enhanced by drunken ness (4:10-18; 7:3-7; 9:1-2; cf. 5:1-4; 6:8-10).8 It is significant that Amos, the only other eighth century writing prophet of Northern Israel, never mentions the Baal.9 ( 2 ) Tentatively cf. the summary in S.

The answer in the book of Kings should be taken literally :Jehu wiped out the official, royally sponsored, Baal cult from the land ( 2 Kgs to : 1-2 8 ). Of course, private idolatry was ridiculed by the prophets as fetishistic asabbîm ( Hos 4:17 ;l0 Mic 1:7 =pesîlêha,but cf. below), be'àlîm =pesîlîm (Hos elîlîm (Isa 2:8, 18, 20; 3:7, but cf. below), ma'asëh yâd/'àsâ-lô (Isa 2:8; 31:7; 37:1g; Hos 14:4; Mic 5:12),but since, as has been argued, it was not state sponsored it was not a threat to the worship of YH WH. True, Amos Amos 5:16 mentions the Mesopotamian deities Sikkuth12and Kiyyun1,3 which may have penetrated into northern Israel through Aramean mediation!4 But it is the only reference to these gods in all of Scripture. Note their total ab sence from Hosea and from the list of Mesopotamian gods worshipped in the land after the exile of its inhabitants (2 Kgs 17:29-34).This indicated that their cult was neither widespread (perhaps limited to the aristocracy of Samaria) nor long lasting. In In Judah, the major writing prophet of the eighth century is Isaiah. Only one of the seven references to idolatry (cited above) refers to Isaiah's own time ( 2:8 ). It is part of Isaiah's larger denunciation against the proliferation of magic, chariots, fortified walls, towers, large ships — and even against the high places in nature : cedars, oaks, mountains. All are extensions of or con tribute to human pride. It is man's hubris that is responsible for idolatry: He "makes" his own gods!5 This notion is neatly captured by the rabbis: "Rabbi Johanan said in the name of R.Simeon b. Yohai : Every man in whom there is haughtiness of spirit (gassûtrûah) is as though he worships idols"(b. Sot. 4b). Psychological insight is provided by Erich Fromm: "Man spends his energy, his artistic capacities, on building an idol, and then he worships this idol, which is nothing but the result of his own human effort. His life forces have flowed into a'thing,'. . . (is experienced) as something apart from himself, over and against him, which he worships and to which he submits."16 Isaiah does not call for an immediate end to idolatry. Nor does he warn his (10) But cf. H.L.Ginsberg,"Lexicographical Notes," SVT 16(1967)71-82, esp. 74-75. (11) But cf. Kaufmann, The History of Israelite Religion, 2:117, n.36.

On the contrary, the abolition of idolatry, so graphically portrayed in 2:6-8, will only be car ried out in the unpredictable future (vv. 18-21).The remaining references to idols say the same (17:8; 27:9; 30:22; 31:7).Thus Isaiah, as his northern counterparts, does not see paganism as a threat to Y H WH. The reason is the same as that of the North: State sponsored idolatry had been abolished. As described in the book of Kings, the high priest Jehoiada destroys Athaliah's Baal temple as a consequence of the covenant struck between YHWH and the king (2 Kgs 11:17-18). Micah's prophecy on Judean apostasy is clearly influenced by his older contemporary, Isaiah. In an eschatological passage ( bayyôm hahu, 5:9 ) he pre diets the destruction of idols together with horses, chariots, fortresses, cult pillars and cities(5:12-13).Micah's one other reference to idolatry refers to the imminent destruction of North Israel (1:7). There is no future for the North : Its doom is sealed. But, as in Isaiah, there is no mention of a foreign god.The idolatry of the masses is home-grown.This would include the sacred poles poles Çasërîm) and incense stands ( hamrnanîm) set up alongside or atop local altars (Isa 17:8) or in homes. Finally, Leviticus 17-27 ( H ),which I attribute to eighth century authors," contains three references to idols: 19:2 and 26:1 which encapsulate the first two commandments of the Decalogue, the latter most likely a product of the sixth century Babylonian exile,18 and 26:30, a result but not a cause of Israel's threatened destruction. In H, the tell-tale word tâmê' is used to indicate the contaminating effects of MolekMolek worship(20:3, on which see below) and necromancy (19:31 ).Taw'is not used with idolatry. This indicates that idolatry does not render either the sanctuary, the land,or its practitioners impure. Neither do the eighth century prophets characterize their references to idolatry as tàmë'. It is not that they are unfamiliar with this term; they use it in connection with foreign lands (Amos 7:17; Hos 9:3-4),drunkenness (Hos 5:3; 6:10),harlotry (Hos 4:11; 77:4 ; 9:1 ), social injustice ( Mic 2:10 )19 and general immorality ( Isa 6:5 ),but not with idolatry. To be sure, H does stigmatize Molek worship as tàmé' it pollutes the sanctuary and desecrates YHWH's name (Lev 20:3 ; cf. 18:21,24). But the people-at-large felt no inconsistency in worshipping both Molek and YHWH in tandem. The importance of this verse (Lev 20:3) should, however, not be overlooked. It is the first time, in my opinion, that any non-YH WHistic wor (17) Tentatively, seeJ.Milgrom,Lmhn«/-/6(AB 3; New York, 1991)28-29, and I.Knohl, The Sanctuary Sanctuary of Silence{ Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 1995) 200-20.

Elsewhere I have argued0־ there was a widespread belief in Judah that the worship of Molek is compatible with the worship of YHWH — hence H twice calls it a desecration of his name (18:21; 20:3). Supportive textual evidence comes from Jeremiah who repeats Y H WH 's dis claimer three times "which I did not command, and which did not come to mind" (7:31; 19:5; 32:35). Moreover, Deut 18:10-11 attests to the common belief that the worship of Molek was licit, as further indicated in Ezek 20:39, namely, that YHWH and Molek could and would be worshipped successively on on the same day. Extrabiblical evidence can be mustered that Molek (= Malik) was an infernal god,21 identified by its worship in the depths of a valley ( rather than on a hill ), and by its juxtaposition with 'ôb and yidde'ônî ( 20:1-6 ),thus in dicating that it was a form of necromancy tied to ancestor worship. Turning to the seventh century, the prophets repeatedly stated that idola try pollutes ( metammè ' ) its adherents, the Temple and the land (Jer2:7~8,23; 7:30; 19:13; 32:34; Ezek 20:7,18, 26,31; 22:3-4; 23:7. 17- 3°: 25:29, 33; 37:23).The quantitative difference in the number of statements on idol atry between the eighth and seventh centuries (15 versus 166 ) is accentuated by the difference in the effects of idolatry, as illustrated by the distribution of the term tàmë': zero times in the eighth century versus 17 in the seventh. How can we account for this stupendous change? First, as mentioned above, we must take the book of Kings at its word: Jehu in North Israel and Jehoiada in Judah wiped out the Baal cult during the second half of the ninth century(2 Kgs 10:1-2; 11:17-18).In effect state-sponsored paganism ceased. It is absent throughout the eighth century. To be sure, there was private fe tishism (see below), but the eighth century prophets were virtually uncon cerned: It was no threat to the worship of YHWH in His sanctuaries or to Israel's existence on its land. To be sure, Molek worship and necromancy are indeed indicated by H (19:31; 20:1-6), but the general populace did not view these acts as incompatible with their allegiance to YHWH, a miscon ception that the priestly tradents of H and the prophets tried to correct? (( 20) Milgrom, I^euiticus 1y-2y (AB 3a; New York: Doubleday, forthcoming). (21) For the best demonstration, cf. J. Day, Molech, A God of Human Sacrifice in the Old Testament (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989); cf. H.P.Muller, ODD, 1005-12. The thusfar un published eighth century, Incirli(EasternTurkey) stele mentions mlk with the meaning"sacri fice"(according to a communication from S. Kaufman, in February 1997). But the language is Phoenician and has no bearing on biblical Hebr ew. (22) As will be argued in Milgrom, Leviticus iy-27 (AB 3a; forthcoming).</page><page sequence="6">6 JACOB MILGROM [6] They may have been aided independently by refugees from the North who brought with them the deuteronomic tradition which vehemently attacked the ancestor cult, as can be seen by its prohibition against offering sacrifices to the dead (Deut 26:14) or participating in funerary rites of mourning (Deut 14:1; 26:14), and by its outright ban of all aspects of magic, including necromancy and Molek worship (Deut 8:10-11).23 The dominant prophets of the seventh century, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, were influenced by the thought,if not the language, of Deuteronomy.24 In the book of Jeremiah, however, the issue is far from clear. Many of its prose pas sages are attributed to deuteronomic tradents,but there is no consensus con cerning their extent and date. Despite the near absence of deuteronomic language in Ezekiel (confirmed by the paucity of Ezekelian citations in Wein feld's exhaustive list of deuteronomic phraseology)25 the same does not hold for deuteronomic thought:6 Uppermost is Ezekiel's advocacy of cultic cen tralizationtralization (e.g., 20:40),an innovative deuteronomic doctrine. Ezekiel exco riates his people for their worship on bàmôt (note his sneering pun, 20:29), and he repeatedly condemns them for "eating on the mountains" (18:6; 13:20, 2 8 ; 34:6 ), figurative language for their sacrificial (sêlàmîm) meals at the bàmôt.bàmôt. True, Deuteronomy's language is hardly recognizable in Ezekiel, but understandably so. Ezekiel is a priest and would be expected to clothe his ideas in a priestly language. Nevertheless, he is imbued with deuteronomic teachings. In sum, Jeremiah, probably a disciple of D (e.g.,Jer 11:1-51 )f is per meated by D's language, and Ezekiel, who speaks in priestly language, is per meated by D's thought. It therefore is D's demand to remove every trace of idolatry, private as well as public, that accounts for the proliferation of state ments against idolatry in the seventh century. But to trace the prophetic denunciations of idolatry to D only begs the question. What accounts for D's obsession with idolatry ( 36 references ) ? First of all, it is a reflex of Manasseh's official sponsorship of foreign gods not just injudah andjerusalem butin theTemple itself ( 2 Kgs 21:3-7). Deuteronomy, however, also alludes to private, superstitious idolatry, bassèter( 7:13; 27:15). D thus anticipates (or reflects) a situation that even after the obliteration of the state-sponsored cults, private ones will continue furtively, as evidenced by the worship of the queen of heaven (Jer 7:18; 44:17-18, 25; Smith's objections (23) Cf.

Ezek 20:31).That these cults were private and unofficial is substantiated by the absence of a clergy, the quintessential component of an officially sponsored cult;29contrast the royally established cult places extirpated byjosiah (2 Kgs 23:4-7,1119 &lt; 15־־ )?° Thus, alongside of official, state- sponsored idolatry there sprouted a widespread, individual or family-centered cult, which existed uninterruptedly after the destruction of the official Baal cult in North Israel and and Judah and even after the Josianic reform successfully annihilated all the royally sponsored cult places in Judah. The biblical evidence of idolatry has yielded thusfar the following picture: The difference in the state-endorsed religion of Judah between the eighth and the seventh century is largely summarized by a single word, rather, by a single person, Manasseh. By force majeure (cf. 2 Kgs 21:16) he reintroduced idolatry into Jerusalem and Judah, completely undoing his father Hezekiah's reform reform ( ibid., v. 3 ),and even succeeding the previous status quo he installed idols in the Temple courtyards and in the sanctuary itself (2 Kgs 21:5,7; 23: 4-7). Also, alongside the official cult, there flourished an ongoing popular cult that continued unabated throughout the eighth and seventh centuries untiljudah's destruction. The Archaeology These deductive conclusions must receive substantive support from the an ciliary discipline of archaeology. First, however, I must credit Yehezkel Kauf mann for possibly being the first to draw a sharp distinction between the official and the popular cult.31 The problem is that he did not investigate the biblical references and allusions sufficiently in order to ferret out the unof ficial religion of the masses. Had he done so, he would not have ascribed monotheism to them. For this failing, however, he should not be faulted sim ply because in his day (the thirties and forties) he did not possess the mas sive archaeological data now available to us. Archaeological evidence for the popular cult exists, and in profusion. Among the artifacts, the most likely candidate is the figurine. Its widespread distribution in time ( throughout Iron Age 11 ) and space (in sites throughout Judah ) warrants certain conclusions concerning the extent and nature of (28) M.

The entire figurine collection reveals a consistent pattern: the figurines cluster in"tolerated, nonconformist worship"(worship"( Holladay's terminology )3,2and are virtually absent from"establish ment sanctuaries," whereas a total of 862 figurines were found throughout the countryside of Judah?3 These, in Kletter's terms," were cheap,everyday ob jects representing the goddess Asherah in private homes, ( mainly ) in front of ordinary people."34 The Asherah is not to be confused with the cult statue of the biblical Asherah, which"was sacred because it was made of expensive materials, situated in a public temple, and represented the goddess in front of all the population!'33 Parade examples of the former arejerusalem Cave I and the City of David. The cave was excavated by Kenyon ;36 its figure hoard was first discussed by Holland, who claims that 597 figurines were found in Jerusalem up to 1975?7 Shilo's excavations at the City of David (1978-85) uncovered over 1300 ad ditional ceramic figurines; they were recently analyzed by Gilber-Peretz.38 Again, the locus of these figurines is outside the temple temenos.

The lack of figurines in the official cult centers in Judah motivated Holla day to deduce : The most economic hypothesis covering the above data seems to be to assign the aniconic shrine-sanctuary-centered to an official established hierarchically organized state religion (or religions,in the case of the di vided monarchy)operative in close coordination with the state's political apparatus.apparatus. The"distributed"cultic remains and iconically "clustered" phenomena, both of which seem totally isolated from the life of the offi cial shrines and sanctuaries, are best explained as popular phenomena, probably dependent upon traditions of folk religion stretching back into the Bronze ages. . 42 Of the City of David figurines, 19% are anthropomorphic (and pillared) and 73% are animal. Of the 211 animal heads, 174 are horses; are they related to the Assyrian" horses of the sun" (2 Kgs 23:11)? In any case, these and some of the other represented animals are levitically forbidden either as offerings or as food. The large number of female figurines show the woman clutching her breast(s), and they seem to be naked. Thus they bear a likeness to the deadea nutrix pose of many L.B. figurines43and perhaps they can be associated with the fertility goddess Asherah(see the addendum, below). Alternatively, they may only be votive offerings, expressing a desire for fertility.441 would, however, concur with Lewis that even if they did not represent Asherah, "they nonetheless may have been thought by the ancients to have derived their efficacy through a goddess."45 The explanation of this hoard can only be speculated. The possibility might be entertained that they are a favissa of the Temple under Manasseh or are objects cleansed from the Temple by Josiah. But this scenario is highly un likely for the figurines stemming from the eighth century, since no such objects appear in Hezekiah's reform.

This means that after the Josianic reform (621 bce), the profusion and practice of figurine worship continue unabated — all in the proximity of the Jerusalem Temple. The de duction is right inescapable :"The evidence from the City of David lends no support to a postulation of an iconoclastic reform between eighth and sixth centuries bce."48 Conclusions Thus, the cult practices attested by the Judahite figurines conform with and confirm the biblical evidence. A distinction has to be made between the of ficial"establishment"cult centers in sanctuaries and the private, occasionally clandestine, worship practiced by the people. The Josianic (and Hezekian) reform occupied itself solely with the former — public cult sites served by Y H Y H WHistic or idolatrous priests49— but it did not penetrate into the private, domestic worship of the masses. This does not imply that Josiah was in prin ciple a monotheist; probably, he was a henotheist, believing in the existence and potency of other gods. His reform (and Hezekiah's) only affirmed that YHWH was Israel's national god, who alone should be worshipped in his land land. Manasseh, to be sure, broke with this pattern, but he continued to main tain yhwh (and his assumed escort, Asherah) as Israel's national god (see the Addendum, below).

(49) The detailed description of the reform undertaken byJosiah(2 Kings 23 )distinguishes consistently between two kinds of officiants, kohanim and kemarim. It is logical to assume that the former are priests of YHWH and the latter, priests of other gods (Akkadian kumru, Aramaic kûmra';kûmra';kûmra'; cf. M.Cogan and H.Tadmor, II Kings [AB 11 ; New York : Doubleday, 1988] 185-86 on 2 Kgs 23:5).The reference to"the idolatrous priests(kemàrïm)who had been installed by the kings of JudahJudah (2 Kgs 23:5a) alludes to Kings Manasseh and his son Amon.whom the deuteronomistic editors accuse of worshipping Molek, Asherah, and astral cults." E.Ben Zvi (A Historical-Critical Study Study of the Book of Zephaniah['RZA'W 198; Berlin: De Gruyter, 1991)69-71 ),however, claims that kemârîmkemârîmkemârîm are priests of YHWH who engage in illegitimate forms of worship, an explanation ac cepted by A.Berlin (Zephaniah [AB 25a; New York: Doubleday, 1994] 74).</page><page sequence="11">[11] IDOLATRY IN JUDAH 11 The biblical evidence reveals that in the eighth century (state idolatry having been abolished), there was no opposition to the idolatry of the pop ulation either by the prophets or the priests. First, it was no threat to official YHWHism; the sanctuaries were now devoted exclusively to the worship of YHWH. Then, one need be ask; what could the prophets have done? They only constituted an infinitesimal minority of Y H WH purists. Isaiah, chapter 2, parades their impotence. He cries out three times in succession mâle'û . . . wattimâle.wattimâle. . . wattimâlë' (vv. 6-8), namely, that the land is overflowing with idolatrous practices," They bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have wrought"(v. 8). This outburst only reflects his helplessness and frustration. Instead of excoriating his people, he figuratively shrugs his shoul ders and throws up his hands. Since Isaiah has no alternative, he can only prophesy that on some future day (bayyôm hahiï) "the idols will vanish com pletely ... on that day {bayyôm, hahiï) men shall fling away, to the moles(?) and the bats, the idols of silver and the idols of gold, which they made for worshipping"(vv.18,20). In the seventh century, the picture begins to change. The doctrine of One God strikes roots and spreads among the masses. One reason, in the main, is responsible: the book of Deuteronomy (or its kernel ),which testifies that Y H WH has placed all idols in all their forms — either for Y H WH or for other gods, public or private — under total ban. Furthermore, the Deuteronomist wages an ongoing polemic against Asherah50especially to dissociate her from the worship of YHWHf'And Deuteronomy's adoptions and promulgation byjosiah, the king, and Hilkiah, the high priest, becomes a permanent irre versible turning point in the history of Israelite religion. This time, the prophets and the Deuteronomist's disciples declare war on idolatry. Appar ently they persuaded many to discard their idolatrous practices so that when struck by the catastrophe of 586, they could justifiably protest "the parents have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge"( Jer 31:28 [29]; Ezek 18:2; cf. Lamentations 5:7). And perhaps precisely because the deuteronomic campaign succeeds so well, the editors of Kings have no choice but to make Manasseh the scapegoat for the destruction (2 Kgs 21:10-11; 23:26-27; 24:3-4,20; cf. Jer 15:4). In the meantime, the Hezekian andjosi anic reforms come and go, but domestic idolatry persists, despite its explicit and vehement denunciation by Deuteronomy and its protagonists. In turn, this arouses the ire of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, which accounts for the lopsided numbers of biblical condemnations of idolatry between the eighth and sev enth century.

After the finding of the Kuntillet Ajrud and Khirbet El Qom inscrip dons, the possibility has been raised that the people-at-large worshipped Asherah as Y H WH's consort:"52 This supposition would explain the prolifer ation of Asherah in the vicinity of Israelite bamôt( 2 Kgs 21:3). In particular, it would throw light on "the idolatry" of Manasseh, who installed a sculpted image (pesel, 2 Kgs 21:7 ; pesel hassemel, 2 Chronicles 33:7; hassemel 2 Chr 33:15 ) of Asherah within the Jerusalem Temple. One should pay close attention to the Deuteronomist's wording of 2 Kings chapter 21. Whereas Manasseh is smeared with the sweeping but vague accusation that he constructed altars for Baal in the land (2 Kgs 21:3; cf. 23:5) and for astral deities in the Temple courtyards (2 Kgs 21:5),the text reaches its strident climax when it indicts Manasseh for placing an image of Asherah in the sanctuary proper (2 Kgs 221:7 ; cf. 2 3:6 )?3Did Manasseh set the Asherah image within the Holy of Holies alongside the Ark and its cherubic throne? If so, Manasseh was thereby not abandoning his loyalty to Y H WH but worshipping him together with his con sort Asherah. That references to Asherah are not necessarily negative is ex emplified by King Asa, looked upon with favor by the deuteronomistic histo rian ( 1 Kings 15:11 ),yet he cuts down Asherah's mipleset 'abominable thing(?)' but not Asherah herself(! Kgs 15:13)! Moreover, one is surprised by only four references to Asherah among the prophets ( Isa 17:8 ; 2 7:9 ;Jer 17:2 ; Mic 5:13 ), all voiced in the masculine plural and, hence, even if not additions to the texts, they denote cult objects rather than the goddess. Thus, the objections in the Bible to Asherah are scant and betray a greater acceptance of Asherah worship than the Deuteronomist would allow.54This deduction from the texts could also be abetted by logic: Since Y H WH may have been associate with Palestinian forms of El;55 it stands to reason that the El-Asherah (Ilu-Athirat) relationship obtaining in Ugarit was transferred by the people to YH WH-Asherah. Why then did Manasseh and the general populace, who bought or carved (52) B. Margalit,"The Meaning and Significance of Asherah," VT40(1g90)264-g7; J.M.

If the Decalogue is used as a grid, the conflict raged over the second commandment, not the first. Popular opinion could well have declared that Asherah was not just another god but an indispensable adjunct of Y H WH, and an image of Asherah need not diminish fealty to him. Monotheistic priests, on the other hand, would reply that YHWH forbade all images, and for support they would cite the hallowed Sinaitic prohibition 10 10 10 taasûn 'ittî 'elôhê zàhàb lô' ta'asû làkem," With me you shall not make any gods of silver, nor shall you make for yourselves any gods of gold" (Exodus 20:20 [23] ),an exegetical application of the second commandment (cf. Ibn Ezra, Cassuto, etc.).That is, YHWH forbids any image to be associated with himself, possibly a veiled reference to Asherah. Moreover, it is even possible that the YHWH exclusivists would not have taken offense if Asherah were aniconic, because it was not the concept of Asherah as consort that incensed them but that she was imaged in a physical form (just as later rabbinic literature expressed the concept of the earthly presence of God by the feminine but incorporeal Shekina)?6 Recently Lutzky has made a strong case for rendering Ezekiel's sêmel haqqin'âhaqqin'â hammaqneh as "the image of the Creatress which provokes to jeal ousy " ( Ezek 8:3 )?7 It already had been suggested by scholars that Ezekiel was referring to Manasseh's tome, and this statue was the one set up by Man asseh?8asseh?8 On the basis of Ugarit's description of Asherah as qnyt'lm' Creatress of the gods'(C7A 4,1, 23; IV, 32) and the nearly obsolete BH verb qânâ 'ere ate' (Genesis 14:19, 22; Deut 32:6; Psalms 139:13; Proverbs 8:22) as well as the theophoric name 'elqânâ ( 1 Sam 1:4-8; Exod 6:24, etc.) and the inscrip tional evidence for 'I qn'rs( at eighth century Karatepe and Jerusalem)?9 it is possible to hypothesize that what outraged the Deuteronomist reformers even more than finding Asherah's image in the Temple was attributing to her creative powers that were independent of YHWH.
