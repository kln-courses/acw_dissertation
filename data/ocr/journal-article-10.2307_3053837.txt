<plain_text><page sequence="1">85 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases: Implications for the Litigation Explosion Debate Valerie P. Hans William S. Lofquist Criticisms of the civil jury, including charges that the jury is biased against business, have been central to debates over the litigation explosion and demands for tort reform. This article seeks to inform these ongoing con- troversies by examining tort jurors' accounts of how they reached decisions in cases with business parties. Interviews and questionnaire data showed that jurors were skeptical of plaintiff tort claims against businesses, organized their accounts more on the actions and motivations of plaintiffs than on the responsibilities of business, and spoke often of the litigation crisis and the importance of limiting awards. his article reports and analyzes findings from a study with tort jurors in business cases. The project, which uses interview methods, provides twin opportunities. First, the interviews al- low us to make a unique contribution to a lively debate in scholarly and policy circles about the jury's role in an alleged litigation explosion. Below, we outline the controversy over the jury in tort cases, and show how the methodology of this study complements quantitative analyses of jury verdicts and can in- form the debate over the jury's role in personal injury cases. Second, jurors' accounts of decisionmaking in business trials provide a window for observing how laypersons approach and decide issues of business responsibility. Studying jurors' ac- counts permits us to examine whether and how lay conceptual- izations of business responsibility are distinct from other liabil- ity and responsibility judgments. The research reported here was funded by National Science Foundation grant No. SES-8822598. The helpful comments of Stephen Daniels, David Ermann, and Sam Gaertner on a prior draft are appreciated.

Although the criticisms vary somewhat, most critics assert that juries perform poorly in business cases and recommend that the role of the civil jury in business litigation be subject to greater regulation or even eliminated. Some critics and courts question the jury's competence to decide complex issues re- lated to business wrongdoing (Austin 1984; Drazen 1989; Hu- ber 1990; In re Japanese Electronics Antitrust Litigation 1980). These critics argue that although the jury has an important place in the criminal justice system, its ability to understand and decide complicated business and economic disputes is lim- ited. Scholars point to the unpredictability and wide variability in civil jury verdicts and awards as evidence of the weakness of the jury as a civil dispute resolution mechanism (e.g., Huber 1990; Olson 1991; Priest 1990). A second line of attack asserts that juries are biased against corporate defendants in personal injury cases (Huber 1988; Ol- son 1991). According to this argument, which enjoys substan- tial business and political support, the populist character of the jury predisposes it to sympathize with the injured individual rather than with the large, impersonal corporation. In this view, jurors bend the evidence or the law so that they may compen- sate the injured plaintiff and satisfy their own feelings of equity. Closely related to this argument is the assertion that the jury is furthering a litigation explosion by granting large awards in meritless lawsuits against "deep-pockets" defendants such as big businesses (Daniels 1989; Huber 1988). Over the past two decades much has happened to stimulate interest in questions about jury competency and bias in busi- ness litigation. Scholars have documented that the courts and juries are more likely today than in previous times to hear dis- putes involving business parties. Legal theories of business lia- bility, particularly in tort cases, have multiplied (Bush 1986; Priest 1985; but see Henderson &amp; Eisenberg 1990). Historians and legal scholars maintain that today business corporations are expected to provide compensation for injuries that in ear- lier times would have been blamed on the victim or on fate (Black 1987; Bush 1986; Friedman 1985). Furthermore, busi- nesses are increasingly likely to resort to the courts to resolve their own disputes (Galanter 1988; Galanter, Macaulay, Palay, &amp; Rogers 1989). As a result of these trends, contemporary civil juries decide business cases with some frequency (Peterson 1987). Finally, business has undertaken a concerted and largely successful campaign to portray the civil litigation system as out of control and hostile to business (Blum 1991; Daniels 1989;</page><page sequence="3">Hans and Lofquist 87 Daniels &amp; Martin 1990; Louis Harris &amp; Associates 1987). Lend- ing policy urgency to this debate is the role that criticisms of the civil jury in business cases have played in arguments for tort reform (Daniels 1989). Many states have modified their civil justice rules, abolishing joint and several liability and placing caps on noncompensatory damages; still other jurisdictions are considering such changes (Sanders &amp; Joyce 1990). Despite the liveliness and policy relevance of this debate and the increased load of business jury trials, both quantitative and qualitative research examining how civil juries actually per- form in such cases is limited. A number of scholars have noted that the critics' portrait of the civil jury appears to be based more on exceptional or apocryphal cases than on systematic re- search (Daniels 1989; Galanter 1987; Hayden 1990). Indeed, close analysis of litigation trends over time and evaluation of jury verdicts cast doubt on whether a widespread litigation ex- plosion has occurred (e.g., Galanter 1983, 1986), and whether juries respond more negatively to business defendants. Analy- ses of trends in civil jury verdicts, based on RAND Corporation data sets of jury verdicts in Cook County, Illinois, and Califor- nia, show shifts over time in jury awards and some differential treatment for corporations (e.g., Chin &amp; Peterson 1985; Peter- son 1987; see also Daniels &amp; Martin 1990; Priest 1990). In par- ticular, Chin and Peterson's (1985) study of jury verdicts in Cook County, Illinois, during the 1960s and 1970s provided some empirical support for a "deep-pockets" hypothesis. Their study revealed that, for seriously injured plaintiffs, corporate defendants were more likely than individual defendants to be found liable and to be assessed greater compensatory damages. However, Chin and Peterson were careful to point out that other factors, among them additional theories of business lia- bility or other differences in the cases of individual and corpo- rate defendants, could have produced divergent decisions. In assessing the significance of the RAND studies, Hensler, Vaiana, Kakalik, &amp; Peterson (1987:24; emphasis in original) concluded: "Jury behavior seems more unpredictable, but this may simply be because we do not have a very good sense of why juries make the decisions they do." Hensler and her colleagues argue that to determine which of the many possible explana- tions for changes in jury verdict trends is correct, research that examines how and why jurors arrive at their decisions must be undertaken. Only a handful of studies, most quite recent, have subjected the civil jury to such scrutiny (Diamond &amp; Casper 1991; Selvin &amp; Picus 1987; Vidmar 1991). Interview studies such as the one we report here thus provide an important com- plement to verdict trend analyses by trying to discover why, from the jurors' own perspectives, they reach the decisions that they do.</page><page sequence="4">88 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases The Conceptualization of Business Responsibility Conley and O'Barr (1991:23) have examined litigants' ac- counts of their experiences in small claims courts as "a window on how lay people conceive of the law and interpret legal rights and obligations." Likewise, our study of juror accounts allows us to explore lay judgments of business's legal responsibilities. Despite a good deal of legal scholarship on corporate liability (e.g., Brickey 1984; Hamilton 1986), there has been only a modest amount of sociolegal research on how people-and ju- rors in particular-conceptualize corporate and business re- sponsibility. Public opinion polls show general public support for business (Lipset &amp; Schneider 1987) but punitive responses to corporate wrongdoing (Cullen, Maakestad, &amp; Cavender 1987; Grabosky, Braithwaite, &amp; Wilson 1987; Levi 1987). Thus, while it is inaccurate to assert that the general public is uncon- cerned about business wrongdoing, the majority of the public does not hold antagonistic views of business. The existing data indicate that public attitudes toward business violations are complex and nuanced, and are influenced by lay views of the nature of organizational behavior, the roles and responsibilities of business, and the content of particular cases of wrongdoing. Many legal commentators have remarked on how difficult it is, as both a personal matter and a legal matter, to conceptual- ize, analyze, and punish business wrongdoing (Coffee 1981; Fisse 1983; Orland 1980; Rourke 1990; Stone 1975). In a case of corporate wrongdoing, focusing on the organization runs counter to legal and cultural standards of individualism and elicits charges of anthropomorphism. How, for example, does one measure the intent of an organization? Yet focusing just on the individuals involved is also problematic, as it minimizes the group context and collective purpose of individual activity within organizations. Although the usually hierarchical organi- zation of businesses and corporations should in theory provide for clear lines of authority and responsibility, the participation of multiple parties, sometimes with differing and even conflict- ing interests, the compartmentalization of responsibility, and breakdowns in communication often diffuse responsibility within an organization (Ermann &amp; Lundman 1992; Kelman &amp; Hamilton 1989). Although prior work on this question is limited, it suggests that people may take quite different approaches to determining the responsibility of an individual and that of a group such as a business corporation. The group nature of the corporation may have impact on jurors' judgments of corporate liability. As- sumptions about the efficacy of groups (Latane 1981; McCauley &amp; Jacques 1979) may encourage jurors to presume that busi- nesses intend the consequences of their actions. And the fact</page><page sequence="5">Hans and Lofquist 89 that corporations are group entities may also make it more dif- ficult to empathize with a business litigant (Hans 1990). Jurors may be influenced not only by the financial resources of a cor- porate defendant (Chin &amp; Peterson 1985) but also by its repu- tation, size, the popularity or utility of its products, and other resources, such as the number of experts, specialists, or manag- ers it employs. As the critics assert, jurors may harbor prejudice against corporations, perceiving business ethics as governed more by the bottom line rather than by conscience or social responsibility. Finally, legal theories about business liability, many developed in the last several decades (see, e.g., Brickey 1984), offer additional means for holding corporations respon- sible that are typically unavailable to plaintiffs suing individual defendants. The analysis of juror accounts provides a method for determining these potential influences on how lay observ- ers assess the distinctive responsibilities of business for per- sonal injury. Method Participants During a one-year period at a state trial court of general jurisdiction, we identified every civil jury trial that had a busi- ness or corporate party.1 With the judges' permission, we ob- tained from the files the names, addresses, and telephone num- bers of jurors who decided these cases. These jurors received a letter on university stationery asking them to participate in an interview study about their jury experience and informing them that an individual from the Jury Project would call them to de- termine whether they would be willing to participate in the study. Jury Project staff made up to ten telephone calls and sent two additional letters to try to reach the jurors and determine whether they would participate. Only a small minority of jurors could not be contacted by these methods. The overall response rate was 64%, with about 7 of every 12 jurors from each case participating in the study. A total of 269 jurors from 36 differ- ent cases involving businesses and corporations were inter- viewed, including 18 tort (nonmedical malpractice) cases, 8 contract cases, and 10 medical malpractice cases. In this article 1 The study also included one pretest case that fell outside the one-year period. We excluded cases that settled during trial and two cases involving a conflict of inter- est. All the trials in the study, including the pretest case, occurred during 1989-91. As part of their agreement to cooperate in this study, the trial court judges requested that the anonymity of the cases be preserved to the maximum extent possible. To mask the identity of the cases, the exact start and end dates of the study are being withheld and the names of the cases and parties have been changed.</page><page sequence="6">90 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases we report data from the 141 jurors who heard the 18 tort cases only.2 The tort cases represented a broad spectrum of business issues, including worker injuries, asbestos and other product liability cases, consumer injuries in places of business, and au- tomobile accidents in which a business vehicle was involved. In all the tort cases, an individual plaintiff or a group of plaintiffs sued business or corporate defendants. All but three cases in- volved multiple plaintiffs; most typically, an injured party's spouse or other family member joined the injured person as a party in the lawsuit. The asbestos cases included from six to nine plaintiffs apiece. The majority of the defendant corporations were busi- nesses of moderate size and financial resources. One defendant was a Fortune 500 company; five other cases, including the three asbestos trials, included nationally known corporations. In the remaining two-thirds of the cases, the defendant was a regional or local company. Several had only a single place of business. Overall, the plaintiffs prevailed in 14 of the 18 tort trials. Al- though the small number of cases do not permit us to make meaningful statistical comparisons with other studies of tort lit- igation, the win rate in our study appears to be somewhat higher than that found in other projects (see, e.g., Clermont &amp; Eisenberg 1991).3 As in other studies of civil jury awards, the awards in most of the cases in this project were modest, though there were a few very substantial awards. The median award for all cases was $70,000; in 12 cases, the per-case judgment was $130,000 or 2 For several reasons data from the contract and medical malpractice cases will be analyzed separately in later papers. Because many arguments against the civil jury per- tain to their performance in personal injury lawsuits, we decided to concentrate our initial analyses on tort cases rather than contract cases. In addition, Galanter 1988, Engel 1984, and Hayden 1991 have all suggested that juries react differently to tort versus contract disputes, indicating the desirability of separate analysis. Our early analyses revealed that jurors responded distinctively to medical malprac- tice cases. Although all doctors and dentists in our group of cases were members of professional corporations, few jurors knew it. We were thus unable to ask questions about how they decided corporate liability. (Interestingly, this appears to be an ex- treme version of the "ghostly" presence of the corporation in many tort trials, docu- mented in the body of this article.) We concluded that medical malpractice cases also deserved separate treatment. Vidmar's (1991) work on medical malpractice juries sug- gests that our basic conclusions about tort jurors' reactions to plaintiffs would not be substantially altered by the presence or absence of medical malpractice jurors. The win rate, however, would have been lower had we included medical malpractice cases. 3 The departure from a 50% win rate raises some interesting issues about busi- ness litigants' settlement and trial strategies that cannot be answered with our data. Business litigants may be unable to predict jury outcomes to gauge which cases they should take to trial. Alternatively, they may be pursuing an aggressive strategy in taking some clear liability cases to trial. Or they may accurately anticipate a finding of liability but go to trial over the award amount. According to the jurors' interviews, in a number of cases the key element in dispute appeared to be the amount of the award rather than the fact of liability.</page><page sequence="7">Hans and Lofquist 91 less. However, one judgment was close to a million dollars, and two were multimillion-dollar awards, resulting in an overall mean award for all cases of $837,588, and a per-plaintiff mean award of $273,827.4 Both multimillion-dollar awards came in cases in which plaintiffs were paralyzed and required lifetime nursing care. Thus the study included a wide range of cases, most of them with relatively low stakes. The tort jurors' demographic characteristics were as fol- lows: 54% were female, and 88% were Caucasian, with the ma- jority (70%) married. Seven percent had less than a high school degree, and 39% had graduated from high school, with the re- mainder having some college (28%), a college degree (20%o), or graduate training (6%). Most were either Protestant (45%) or Catholic (37%). Asked to identify their political orientation, 32% of the jurors described themselves as conservative, 37% as moderate, and 31 % as liberal. Fourteen percent had been or were currently members of a union. Jurors were also asked to estimate, in $10,000 ranges, their total household income for the previous year. Just 6% reported household incomes of less than $20,000; 17% reported incomes between $20,000 and $30,000; 16% had incomes between $30,000 and $40,000; 22% had incomes between $40,000 and $50,000; 19% had in- comes between $50,000 and $60,000; and 18% reported household incomes over $60,000. Demographic information, including race, gender, educa- tion, occupation, employer, age, and marital status, was avail- able from court records for each juror who served in our study cases. These data permit us to compare the demographic char- acteristics of participants and nonparticipants in our study, pro- viding insights into the representativeness of the participants. The two areas in which significant differences were found were race and occupational status. Compared to the group of non- participants, the study participants included significantly fewer blacks (X2 (1 df)= 8.44, p &lt;.01). Blacks comprised 17 % of all tort jurors but only 12% of the study participants. After coding jurors' occupations into census occupational categories, such as managerial/professional, technical/sales, service, craft, and labor, it was found that the study also included more jurors with higher status occupations (X2 (1 df)= 11.47, p&lt; .01). There were no significant differences in the other demographic char- acteristics of participants and nonparticipants. Participants and 4 Mean and median figures presented in the text include the four cases in which the jury found for the defense and gave no award. Excluding defense verdicts, the me- dian award was $97,500 and the mean award jumped to $1,017,071. The per-plaintiff mean award was $316,422. Thus, with or without the cases netting no awards, there is a similar pattern of low median and high mean awards. Awards were rounded to the nearest thousand dollars for analysis.</page><page sequence="8">92 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases nonparticipants were equally likely to be employed by a large corporation (as defined by inclusion on the Fortune 500 list). To determine whether jurors who were more favorable about their jury experience were more likely to participate in the study, we asked all jurors who were contacted by telephone to respond to the question: "On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 the highest, how would you rate your jury experience?" The small number of jurors who could not be reached by telephone were mailed a stamped, addressed post- card asking this same question. Jurors' ratings of their jury ex- perience were on the average very positive: the mean rating was 7.3, with the most frequent response an 8. Ratings did not differ for participants and nonparticipants, indicating that the jurors' overall assessment ofjury service was not linked to their decision to participate in the study. Procedure Using a semistructured interview format, we interviewed each juror individually and asked for reactions to the parties and evidence in the case.5 Jurors had the choice of being inter- viewed at the university or at their home. The jurors were com- pensated $15 for the interview, the same amount they received for a day's jury duty. Those who came to the university for the interview were paid an additional $5 to cover parking and transportation expenses. The interview questions central to this article revolved around how juries evaluated the tort liability of businesses and corporations. We first asked jurors to provide their general im- pressions of the parties in their case. To obtain their views of corporate responsibility, we asked jurors to reflect on how they were affected by the presence of a corporation in the lawsuit ("How did the fact that one of the parties was a business affect the way you thought about the case?"). In addition, we in- quired whether their reactions to the case would have differed if an individual rather than a corporation had been sued ("Do you think that, if all the other circumstances were the same but the defendant was an individual rather than a corporation, you would have thought about the case any differently?"). We also 5 Jury panels served for two weeks. At the request of the judges, jurors were not contacted by letter until all jurors from the panel had completed serving on all trials. This requirement meant that the time between the end of a case and the interview was typically more than a month. The median number of days between the case and the interview for the tort jurors was 50; the mean was 56.5, with a range from 20 to 137 days. Because we interviewed a substantial number of jurors from each case, we were able to compare their responses and assess how the timing of the interview influenced jurors' memories of their decisionmaking process. Jurors had surprisingly vivid and detailed recollections of the witnesses, particularly the plaintiffs, and key aspects of evidence. Typically they could remember very little about judicial instructions, unless those instructions had been an important element of the jury deliberation.</page><page sequence="9">Hans and Lofquist 93 asked about their general views toward corporate responsibility ("Do you think that corporations should be held to a different standard of responsibility than individuals?"). The interviews typically lasted about an hour. Jurors also filled out an extensive questionnaire about their attitudes to- ward business, corporate responsibility, and civil litigation; gave responses on a number of psychological scales; and pro- vided demographic information. Positive and negative phras- ings of key attitudinal items were employed to control for agreement response bias. Most questions were answered on a five-point scale, ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree," with a midpoint labeled "neither agree nor disa- gree." The majority of jurors filled out the questionnaire im- mediately after the interview, while others completed the ques- tionnaire later and mailed it in. Results In general, our research findings are consistent with the view that the contributions of the civil jury to the litigation ex- plosion are exaggerated. Rather than revealing jurors willing or eager to impose on business the costs of plaintiffs' injuries, our findings show that jurors were suspicious of the legitimacy of plaintiffs' claims and concerned about the personal and so- cial costs of large jury awards. Despite insistence on product safety and high expectations of business, jurors were generally favorable toward business, skeptical more about the profit mo- tives of individual plaintiffs than of business defendants, and committed to holding down awards. Below we provide evi- dence for our conclusions from the tort jurors' interviews and questionnaire data. Tort Jurors' Attitudes toward Civil Litigation Jurors' responses to questionnaire items about the legiti- macy of civil lawsuits revealed considerable skepticism toward plaintiffs and civil litigation. As shown in Table 1, tort jurors had strong negative views about the frequency and legitimacy of civil lawsuits. About four of every five jurors believed that "People are too quick to sue, rather than trying to solve dis- putes in some way," and asserted: "There are far too many friv- olous lawsuits today." Just a third of the jurors agreed that "Most people who sue others in court have legitimate griev- ances." Jurors rejected the statement that "By making it easier to sue, the courts have made this a safer society" by a ten-to- one margin. However, just one-third went so far as to assert that "The large number of lawsuits show that our society is breaking down."</page><page sequence="10">94 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases Although they questioned the legitimacy of most civil law- suits, jurors' negativity did not extend to the institution of the civil jury, in which they had personally participated. Our sam- ple generally endorsed the institution, with six out of ten agree- ing that "Juries do a good job determining the outcomes of lawsuits and assessing damages." As noted above, the majority of jurors rated their own jury experience as quite positive. However, more people agreed (39%) than disagreed (23%) that jury damage awards were too high. Tort Jurors' Skepticism toward Plaintiffs As their general responses to questions about civil litigation imply, the tort jurors approached their own cases with consid- erable suspicion about the plaintiff. Indeed, in these personal injury lawsuits, jurors focused most on the plaintiffs in the case, rather than on the businesses that were sued. Consistent with other research (e.g., Pennington &amp; Hastie 1986) showing that criminal jurors develop a story of the incident leading to the trial and make motivational inferences about the parties in the cases, the civil jurors in our study actively developed stories about the accidents that injured the plaintiffs and about the paths the plaintiffs traveled to arrive at the courthouse. The stories usually revolved around the motivations of the plaintiffs and their attorneys rather than the responsibilities or charac- teristics of businesses. In the asbestos cases, for example, there was considerable discussion about jurors' perceptions that the lawsuits had been initiated at the urging of entrepreneurial attorneys. As one ju- ror stated:6 Some lawyers were running around getting clients to sue companies who sold asbestos and installed asbestos and were trying to make somewhat of a killing out of it. We didn't have very much sympathy for the plaintiffs because we figured this bordered on being an unethical procedure. These lawyers went and found these people, [who] filed a grievance to get something out of it, because the lawyer is going to get about 40%0 or more of anything they get. By discrediting the motives of the plaintiffs' attorneys, this story drew attention away from the issue of the defendants' negligence and focused attention on the legitimacy of the plaintiffs' claims. Jurors' dubiousness about plaintiff claims led them to scru- tinize the personal behavior of plaintiffs, trying to understand their motives and to assess the reasonableness of their claims. Seemingly no aspect of the plaintiffs' behavior was beyond 6 This quotation and all others are taken from transcripts of the tape-recorded interviews.

Jurors often penalized plaintiffs who did not meet high standards of credibility and behavior, including those who did not act or appear as injured as they claimed, those who did not appear deserving due to their already high standard of liv- ing, those with preexisting medical conditions, and those who did not do enough to help themselves recover from their inju- ries. One story jurors told with some frequency was that of the money-hungry plaintiff. A juror in an asbestos case commented on the long list of defendants in observing: "I think [the plain- tiffs] were out to get money, all they could get, because they sued a lot of companies." Another juror observed of the plain- tiff in a motor vehicle personal injury trial: "She worked for an insurance company and she did medical claims. So, I think probably, looking at these medical claims, she said, 'Well, maybe I can cash in on this knee injury.' " As another juror stated: "This is my opinion, that these [plaintiffs] were out to make a killing from these companies. And, of course, if they had to pay out any large sums, it's gonna affect you and me, because they'll raise their prices in products." In a number of instances, jurors relied on their own per- sonal experiences to judge the plaintiffs behavior or injury. In one of the asbestos cases that resulted in a combined award of $69,500 for nine plaintiffs, the pro-defense jurors in the major- ity argued that everyone faces danger in the workplace and that workers could always change jobs if they believed they were in</page><page sequence="12">96 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases danger. As one asbestos juror put it: "I worked in a dental lab- oratory, and I've been exposed to acrylics. But I don't feel as though I should sue the company, because if I didn't like the smell or thought it was doing any harm to me I could have quit." In a workplace accident case that resulted in a defense verdict, the jurors faulted the plaintiff for failing to use all the safety equipment. A juror who had construction experience himself was one of the strongest advocates for this position, even though he admitted that he and other construction work- ers routinely neglected to use safety equipment because it was too much trouble. For one juror who heard a case of a plaintiff seeking damages for a knee injury sustained in a car accident, her own injuries led her to minimize the plaintiffs suffering: "I have a knee injury, and it seemed to me that what she was com- plaining about was the same thing I have. I mean, the weather bothers you, but basically it's just something that you have to live with." Thus jurors drew on their own experiences, compar- ing their own outcomes with the claims of the plaintiff. These comparisons led them to reflect upon the inequities in compen- sating plaintiffs for injuries for which jurors themselves had not received financial remuneration. Although the majority of jurors were suspicious of plaintiff claims, jurors were not uniformly critical. In a number of cases a minority of jurors spoke up for the legitimacy of plaintiff claims. For example, in the workplace accident described above, jurors who favored the plaintiff tried to explain away his failure to use safety equipment by arguing that his supervisor should not have told him to undertake the risky action, and pointed out that because the worker was new to the job, it would have been hard to refuse. In an asbestos case in which other jurors had derided the plaintiffs ("I figured that they were comfortable and they were just out to get a large sum of money to take trips and buy bigger boats"), one juror in the minority used the plaintiffs' comfortable lifestyle to maintain in their favor: "It wasn't like they were just trying to sue 'cause they had money or they wouldn't be taking all these vacations and having all these boats. ... It wasn't just all about money.... They gave me an impression they just wanted to get what was rightfully theirs." On the whole, however, plaintiffs were subjected to a surprising degree of suspicion regarding motivation and deservingness that, as we detail below, was not typically imposed on defendants. In addition, and probably contributing to the scrutiny shown plaintiffs, there was the widespread impression among jurors that the civil litigation system is overburdened by claim- ants seeking awards in meritless cases. As one juror put it: "people are too quick to sue nowadays. They're looking for the deep pockets." Comments about excessive and meritless litiga-</page><page sequence="13">Hans and Lofquist 97 tion were accompanied by expressions of concern about higher insurance premiums and businesses passing on costs to cus- tomers. These negative comments about plaintiffs might seem to be at odds with the fact that plaintiffs won 14 out of the 18 trials. Yet many of these comments occurred in cases in which the plaintiff prevailed on the verdict. Some jurors used anti-plain- tiff remarks to argue against liability, while others employed them to argue against high awards. Jurors who were doubtful about liability often compromised with the other jurors on lia- bility in exchange for a reduced award. Our impression from the interviews was that jurors who were most doubtful of plaintiff claims and most insistent on the existence of a litigation explosion were more likely to favor de- fense verdicts and low awards. (Other researchers have found correlations between litigation explosion attitudes and awards in mock juror studies; Greene, Goodman, &amp; Loftus 1991; see also Loftus 1979). To test for this association, we used correla- tional statistics to examine the relationship between jurors' re- sponses to the questionnaire items and the jury awards. Recod- ing the seven items in Table 1 so that higher numbers indicated more negative judgments of litigation, we developed a litiga- tion crisis scale (alpha = .65). To obtain a summary score of each jury's attitudes toward litigation, we calculated mean liti- gation crisis scale judgments for each of the 18 juries separately by summing the individual jurors' responses on each jury and dividing by the total number of jurors on each jury. We then correlated these mean judgments with the final jury awards in each of the 18 tort cases, counting the defense verdicts as zero awards. The correlation between the mean litigation crisis scale response and the jury award was -.54 (p&lt; .05). Thus, the more strongly that jurors collectively perceived a litigation explosion, the lower the award their jury reached. It is a remarkable correlation but difficult to interpret. It seems consistent with the interviews to infer that jurors came to the cases with predispositions about the overall merits of plain- tiff claims and interpreted their own cases in line with these expectations. Alternatively, serving on a meritorious lawsuit that resulted in a high award may have altered jurors' judg- ments of the extent of deserving litigation. Tort Jurors' Attitudes toward Business Comparing the reactions of jurors to personal injury plain- tiffs and business defendants produced some surprising results. Contrary to the skepticism shown plaintiffs, corporate defend- ants were typically not subjected to such vigorous scrutiny. Even when jurors concluded, as they did in most cases, that the</page><page sequence="14">98 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases legal requirements for liability had been met and that a plaintiff award was in order, the majority of jurors expressed neutral or positive views of the business litigants. Findings of liability thus were not typically associated with conclusions that businesses had intended to harm workers or consumers or with condem- nations of the business community. We tapped jurors' general attitudes toward the legal regula- tion of business through a series of items on the impact of busi- ness lawsuits, government regulation, and worker and product safety. In their questionnaire responses, tort jurors expressed their beliefs that businesses should be required to meet high operational and product quality standards. At the same time, jurors expressed some concerns about the negative effects of too much business regulation. Table 2 confirms that many ju- rors see a litigation explosion in business cases. More than half of the tort jurors agreed that "The threat of lawsuits is so prev- alent today that it interferes with the development of new and useful products." Yet the majority stopped short of agreeing that "The courts have meddled so much in the workplace that many businesses are not able to remain competitive" or that "The government has gone too far in regulating business and interfering with the free enterprise system." Just three out of ten jurors on average agreed with these statements. One nota- ble aspect of the tort jurors' responses to this set of questions is that they tended to cluster in the middle of the scale. Very few jurors either strongly agreed or strongly disagreed about the impact of governmental and legal regulation of business. This moderation changed, however, for more specific ques- tions about product safety, where jurors expressed views strongly supportive of regulation. Two of three jurors agreed that "Ensuring the safety of products sold to the public is so important that regulations and standards cannot be too high," while nine out of ten asserted that "A company should be re- quired to tell the public about any possibility, however small, that its products might be unsafe." These jurors rejected the claim that "Requiring that products be 100% safe before they're sold to the public is just too expensive." They also sup- ported a tough standard for business responsibility for product defects, with just over a quarter agreeing that "Companies should not be responsible for defects in their products if they used the best scientific and safety information available at the time." This standard is relevant to asbestos and other product liability lawsuits in which corporate defendants claim that the discovery of a defect came long after product introduction.7 In 7 Interestingly, jurors from asbestos trials differed in their responses to this ques- tion. Asbestos jurors were more likely to assert that corporations should not be respon- sible for product defects if they relied on scientific and safety information available at the time of production (asbestos jurors' M=2.81; other tort jurors' M=3.49;</page><page sequence="15">Hans and Lofquist 99 Table 2.

Overall, the questionnaire responses seem to indicate sup- port at an abstract level for government regulation of business and high expectations of business in providing safe products and disclosing problems with products. However, jurors were clearly opposed to the perceived extent to which individuals were filing suit against businesses and were mixed in their sup- port of the role of juries in cases where these preventive efforts prove inadequate. As with litigation crisis attitudes, to test for an association F(1,136)=8.87, p=.003). Although it is possible that asbestos jurors differed from other tort jurors in their pretrial attitudes, a more likely possibility is that asbestos defense attorneys were partly successful in shifting jurors' views on this issue.</page><page sequence="16">100 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases between pro-business attitudes and jury awards, we used corre- lational statistics to examine the relationship between jurors' responses to the questionnaire items and the jury awards. Recoding the nine items in Table 2 so that higher numbers in- dicated more pro-business, antiregulation attitudes, we devel- oped a business attitudes scale (alpha = .59). As before, to ob- tain a summary score of each jury's business attitudes, we computed the mean business attitudes scale judgments for each of the 18 juries separately. We then correlated these mean judgments with the final jury awards in each of the 18 tort cases, again counting the defense verdicts as zero awards. The correlation between the mean business attitudes scale response and the jury award was -.47, which did not reach traditional levels of statistical significance. As jurors collectively supported business and opposed regulation more, they were marginally more likely to arrive at a lower award. The Corporation as Ghost The questionnaire responses suggest that jurors might be quite demanding of corporate defendants, particularly in in- stances in which the safety of the public is at issue. Yet we found little evidence of tough standards and punitiveness to- ward the corporation in the specific cases decided by the tort jurors. An unexpected finding was that the ways in which jurors talked about businesses were much less concrete than the way in which they evaluated plaintiffs. Part of the reason for this difference may be traced to the fact that in many cases no indi- vidual from the corporation presented trial testimony. There's an adage that it is hard to punish corporations because they have "no body to kick, no soul to damn." Continuing the meta- phor, the corporation is often a "ghost" in the courtroom. In our study, the attorney was often the only representative of the business in court. In most of the cases in the sample, the CEOS stayed away. Jurors often wondered where they were. Yet the business executives' absence seemed to work to their advan- tage, in that jurors had few grounds on which to make the kinds of detailed evaluations and inferences about their behavior that characterized their judgments of the plaintiffs. When asked how they were affected by the presence of a corporation in their case, many jurors replied that they were not influenced by the presence of a corporation. As one juror stated, "It didn't really affect me. I try to be fair with people." Another replied, "It didn't matter whether it was an individual or a corporation. I was more interested in the exact testimony that was presented." When we asked jurors to take the next step, and comment as to whether they viewed corporations dif- ferently from individuals, a commonly expressed view was that</page><page sequence="17">Hans and Lofquist 101 "businesses and corporations are made up of individuals. They don't act as a body that has no mind or anything. They are indi- viduals and it's kind of a fallacy for me to think that a business [is different from] the people who make up the business." One case provides a good example of how jurors focused on specific individuals rather than on corporate entities in eval- uating responsibility. In that case, a worker had been injured on a construction job. He was not able to sue his own employer directly, because a workers' compensation scheme provided some compensation and precluded most lawsuits. He instead sued a machine operator and the company that had hired the machine operator. In response to a question about how the presence of the company influenced his judgments in the case, one juror replied: It didn't really affect my thinking at all because they were so removed from the process and that may have been a deliber- ate strategy on their part. But it was essentially [the construc- tion worker versus the machine operator] in the courtroom so that's the way I thought of it. [The company] didn't really enter into my thinking. Another juror from the case concurred, saying, "It seemed to be [a dispute between two individuals] pretty much anyway, even though [the company] was named in the suit, because it was not there and because all of the testimony kind of revolved around [the construction worker and the machine operator]." In the car accident cases, the corporate defendant usually remained well in the background. Although most of the jurors interviewed in one auto accident trial knew that the truck was owned by a company, most did not know the nature or identity of the business (a local roofing contractor): "that really was im- material to the case," and "that didn't enter my mind at all." In another case involving a worker injury, one juror ob- served that "when it's a corporation, you get a little bit more impersonal. You don't have one person, it's not like you have a person to focus on.... It surprised me that there wasn't some- one else [besides the defense attorney] there." One exception to the generally neutral or positive stance jurors expressed toward business defendants came in a case of a worker injured in a building. The business defendant was a company owned by a man who was reputed to hold a substan- tial amount of substandard property in the jurisdiction. A number of jurors made derogatory remarks about the defend- ant. The case was distinctive from others in the study in two ways: Because the defendant corporation was highly identified with its owner, it offered an individual party on which to focus attention; and the business defendant had a poor reputation in the community. Thus, in many personal injury cases, the jurors' attention</page><page sequence="18">102 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases was captured by the individual-level drama and concrete specif- ics of the case. Though some jurors expressed disdain for the profit motives of corporations, most paid particular attention to the actions and motivations of particular actors, especially the plaintiff. The plaintiffs were more likely to be in the courtroom and easily identifiable. As jurors developed accounts of what happened in the accident, the absence of the corporation or the difficulty of finding a way to conceptualize it as an actor seemed to minimize its consideration by jurors. Tort jurors held high standards for business in the abstract, as we saw in their ques- tionnaire responses, yet these standards became more diffused or difficult to apply as jurors approached the concrete task of assessing responsibility and compensation in individual cases. Distinctive Judgments of Corporate Responsibility Although many jurors asserted that the presence of a cor- poration did not influence their decisionmaking, a minority of jurors made interesting comments about how aspects of the corporation affected them or other jurors. It is worthwhile cata- loguing these lay notions of distinctive corporate responsibil- ity, although we emphasize that most jurors did not articulate them. Occasionally, jurors asserted that corporations should or would be held to a higher standard of responsibility than indi- viduals. For example, a black woman juror observed: The higher you are and bigger you are, then the more re- sponsible you are for certain things. Even in everyday life. This is just a parable. You in your position [referring to the inter- viewer], they look at you different than they would look at me. Not because I'm black or white. This is the same difference, you know what I'm saying? Because they expect more out of you than they would me. In explaining why corporations should be held to a higher stan- dard of responsibility than individuals, anotherjuror took a dis- tinctly organizational approach, stating: Because a corporation has a group of people that should be able to handle a situation and may be more knowledgeable about a situation than an individual might be. And I'm talking about a big corporation who has different departments to handle different things. As a safety department would and maybe a law department, an accounting department, and their people are experts in these fields, so, of course, they're gonna know more than maybe just one individual person. Similarly, in a worker injury case in which the construction company had violated OSHA regulations, several jurors said that they thought a large company should have known better.</page><page sequence="19">Hans and Lofquist 103 [S]ince they're so large, they have probably more resources to get knowledge and information. So, they have some more re- sponsibility to make whoever they're working for, whoever's working for them also aware of these, for safety and every- thing. Because that's what happens as soon as you fall on your work steps. They know you're gonna go after them. So they should be fully cautious. A second juror on the case thought that an individual contrac- tor "might just have gotten a slap on the hand" but that "when you're talking about a big company, that's even more reason for them to know about OSHA regulations." Another motive for holding corporations to higher stan- dards of responsibility involved the wider impact they, com- pared to individuals, could have. A member of one jury that decided a supermarket slip-and-fall incident in favor of the store asserted: "Of course they've got to exercise a great deal more safety awareness, they've got many more people in there to worry about. Yeah, I think they fall to a higher standard. I think even we were holding them to a higher standard." This juror concluded that even by this higher standard the super- market was not negligent in the slip and fall. To summarize, although most jurors believed that corpora- tions and individuals should be treated similarly, some thought that corporations, because of their status, size, resources, or greater potential impact, should or would be held to a higher standard of responsibility than individuals. To examine the issue of individual versus organizational agency from another angle, we asked each juror whether he or she would have decided the case differently if there had been no corporation-if it had been a dispute between individuals. This question was linked to other lines of research that feature experimental variations of defendant identity. Mock jury exper- iments vary whether workers are hired by an individual or a corporation. In one such experiment, people differentiated be- tween individual and corporate defendants, and were more likely to find corporate than individual defendants liable hold- ing the other facts of the case constant (Hans &amp; Ermann 1989). The differentiation persists even when people are admonished to treat them similarly (Appel 1991). In the present research, most jurors said that they would have decided the case just the same had it been a dispute be- tween individuals. As one juror, who sat in a case in which a child had been injured in a store, said, "I thought of it in the same way I would treat my premises. I would not want some- body to be injured on my premises, and I see a store owner as having a similar obligation, just from a safety standpoint." In a few cases in which multiple parties potentially caused a workplace accident, some jurors thought that the corporate set-</page><page sequence="20">104 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases ting made it difficult to figure out what had happened. They imagined that simpler scenarios would occur in cases with indi- vidual parties. One juror said, "I guess it would be different if it was just a person in a home. . . . Hopefully you would have more explicit information and would know what the heck was going on rather than everybody hinting at this is what hap- pened or that is what happened and nobody having an accident report." Another juror from the same case agreed, saying, "I think if it was at home, someone would know exactly what hap- pened. But this was sort of a mystery." These remarks are con- sistent with scholarly research that diffusion of responsibility can limit the culpability attributed to actors within hierarchical groups such as corporations (Kelman &amp; Hamilton 1989; Hans 1990). Finally, there was some scattered concern about the profit motive causing business to cut corners. During one of the as- bestos jury deliberations, two automobile workers talked about their own experiences within a corporate environment. One of them recounted a statement the other made during jury delib- eration: "You people in here have probably never worked for the type of production company that these companies were. We have. We know what goes on. If it's anything that cuts the bottom line, boy, forget it. It's out .... All big corporations, look, the bottom line is profit. If it's not profitable, or anything that cuts into the profit, forget it, we don't do it." However, contrary to our initial expectations, such comments derogating business were rare compared to the more frequent negative evaluations of the plaintiffs and their mercenary motives. Jurors' Reactions to Legal Rules of Business Liability Business cases, both civil and criminal, are often governed by unique rules of liability, such as respondeat superior or strict liability, that may be unfamiliar to jurors or contrary to lay no- tions of responsibility. In a number of cases we were able to explore how jurors responded to legal rules holding businesses responsible for actions of their employees or for subcontrac- tors. One issue that was confronted in a number of worker injury cases was that the immediate employer or supervisor of the in- jured worker was not named in the lawsuit. Instead a supplier or contractor was the defendant. Jurors were typically not in- formed directly about worker compensation rules, which pro- vide compensatory benefits but preclude lawsuits against the employer unless extreme negligence can be proved. As in other cases in which jurors are "blindfolded" (Diamond, Casper, &amp; Ostergren 1989), jurors actively tried to make sense of the ab- sence of a key party and to follow the legal rules in order to do</page><page sequence="21">Hans and Lofquist 105 justice in the case despite their limited information. They often reported that it seemed like the wrong party was being sued or that the chain of responsibility had been stretched too far. In one such case, a workplace accident trial, jurors felt that the defendant company, which had hired a subcontractor who employed the injured worker, should not be held responsible. But "the case was decided according to the law. That's how we decided it. Everybody felt the opposite of what we decided in their hearts. In their minds and in their gut, they felt that [the company] was thoroughly innocent. [The company] was not re- sponsible for the injury. But the law said they were, so they were." Another juror from the same case concurred: My feeling before we deliberated was that [the defendant company] wasn't the one who should have been paying any money-the contracting company should have been the one.... And it was just basically the way we read the law and the way that we interpreted it. .. that's what persuaded the whole group to say [the defendant company] was liable. Be- cause they were owners, they owned the facility, they con- tracted these people, and they were ultimately responsible for the overseeing of the happenings and work on their premises. In another case, the jurors' sympathies were with a child plaintiff injured in a store, but their reading of the law dictated a judgment for the defendant. They followed their interpreta- tion of the law, even though they disagreed with it. As one ju- ror observed: I think it's very clear that the law in this case is biased in favor of corporations. Now why that is, I don't want to speculate. But that's the law. It wasn't that I had no feelings toward the child, I did. I think he suffered a lot from this incident. But I think the law was very clear in this case in terms of the re- sponsibility of the company, the responsibility of the parent. But it seems very clear to me that the law is written in such a way that it's gonna favor business in ... cases like this.... And I think that became very clear to the people on the jury as we began to really argue and debate the facts of the case. What I thought was very interesting was as we argued and discussed, people who apparently had very rigid opinions at the beginning of the deliberation began to break down and began to realize what was happening. The final comment the last holdout made, before we all reached the final decision, was something to the effect that "Well, if you're gonna throw the law at me. . ." Once we determined what the law actually was ... [it] was almost axiomatic that it had to come out the way it did. These examples illustrate the role of law in further complicat- ing juror conceptualization and imposition of business liability. Some business cases challenge the traditional view of individu- als as the primary or sole social actors. Within a specific litiga-</page><page sequence="22">106 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases tion context, legal rules about corporate liability tax jurors by directing them to disregard the key roles of immediate actors who are not parties in the case. Even though jurors who found the legal rules at odds with their own norms of responsibility reported conforming to legal dictates, their decisions were un- doubtedly affected. Deep Pockets Because critics routinely assert that the deep pockets of the corporation influence jury awards, it was of great interest to examine how jurors treated the business defendant's financial resources. In the interviews, the feature of a corporate party most often mentioned by jurors was its financial resources. However, jurors were sharply divided in their views of the ap- propriateness of considering financial resources. A clear minor- ity of the sample took the position succinctly summarized by a juror about the companies in an asbestos case: "Well, we fig- ured they could afford to pay." A much more common position was that the organization's assets should not be and were not relevant to the liability and award decisions. In advancing this view, a number of jurors brought up the fact that other members of their jury mentioned the deep pockets of the corporation but that they personally dis- agreed that a company's ability to pay should be considered in arriving at an award. In a workplace accident case: There were a few individuals on the jury that felt the fact that there's a corporation involved, the corporation can afford to put up the money for this situation.... [T]hey felt like, well, we're just dealing with big business and no person is really going to be hurt. So we'll award some money to these people and we'll take care of poor [George] who fell off the beam. That bothered me. I didn't see that there was any reason that the fact that a corporation was involved had anything to do with it at all. And in fact I was very adamant in deliberation that we should not be deciding this case on the fact that we feel sorry for [George]. As this statement suggests, most jurors made clear in the interviews that they had very serious commitments to their roles as jurors and expressed concern that they decide cases fairly and on the evidence. Judicial and attorney admonitions to set aside sympathy and to treat corporations the same as indi- viduals encouraged jurors to adopt a stance of fair and equal treatment, as did their immersion in the case. Even though some jurors may have come into the case with predispositions, they reported deciding on the basis of the evidence presented in court. As one juror put it: "You do have a prejudice at first, against the corporation. You figure, well, they've got all the money, they've got that. This little bit's not gonna hurt them.</page><page sequence="23">Hans and Lofquist 107 So in a way, you're probably prejudiced right off the bat." The interviewer responded: "You said at first. Did this go away as you went along?" to which the juror replied: "Yea. After a day of it, you just kind of drift into the case, and you stay there. At least that's the way I try and do it, and that's what everybody on the jury seemed to do." Finally, one juror blamed the plaintiffs lawyers when she observed: "The trouble is they're always going after people with money. There's no use suing that poor guy, no use suing me, you could take the house, so what, you know. I think that if you wanna put it bluntly, it's because corporations have money is why the lawyers are there. There's no other reason. Let's face up to it." Thus it was the "profit motive" of individual plaintiffs and the plaintiffs' bar rather than organizational defendants that our jurors most often called into question. Discussion Strengths and Limitations of the Current Study Before describing the implications of this study, it is neces- sary to address some of the pluses and minuses of the juror interview methodology. By interviewing jurors across a range of different tort cases, this project permitted us to arrive at some generalizations about the approaches jurors take to de- ciding issues of business liability. The majority of jurors in the tort trials participated in our study, so that we were able to check jurors' recollections and accounts against other jurors from the same case. Perhaps most important, the semistruc- tured interview method permitted us to obtain answers to spe- cific questions while at the same time allowing jurors to put their accounts in their own words. To our knowledge, no other study to date has interviewed as many jurors in as much depth about how they approached the decisionmaking process. The major limitation of this interview study, as with other interview studies, is that we are necessarily dependent on ju- rors' subjective, post hoc evaluations of their decisionmaking process. Are jurors inescapably influenced by the passage of time (Sanbonmatsu, Kardes, &amp; Sansone 1991), limited self- knowledge and insights concerning how they make decisions (Nisbett &amp; Wilson 1977), the desire to present themselves in a socially desirable light, or the hindsight bias (Casper, Benedict, &amp; Perry 1989)? Of course they are, and it would be naive to accept all the jurors' words at face value. Because our study included multiple jurors from the same trials, it afforded some-although not complete-protection against recall bi- ases. But we would argue that, despite the inevitability of errors and biases in such recollections, jurors' accounts are of sub-</page><page sequence="24">108 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases stantial theoretical and practical interest. For example, whether or not jurors actually treated corporations identically to indi- viduals, it is immensely interesting that jurors defined fairness as treating corporations the same as individuals and that their accounts centered on the responsibilities of plaintiffs rather than businesses. Whether they succeeded in treating corpora- tions exactly as they would have treated individuals is another matter, one better addressed by a different methodology. Another limitation is that the data come from a single juris- diction, raising the issue of their generalizability. Research by Daniels and Martin (1986, 1990; see also Daniels 1990) indi- cates that juries vary widely in damage awards in different juris- dictions, a point also made by critics of the civil jury (Olson 1991). Since corporations have a major presence in the juris- diction under study, the jurors we interviewed, particularly those employed by large businesses, could have been unusually favorable to corporations. To examine whether more direct ex- perience with corporations influenced juror judgments, using F-tests we compared the responses to items from Tables 1 and 2 of tort jurors who were and who were not employed by a major corporation. No significant differences between employ- ees of major corporations and the other jurors were found on any of these items. Furthermore, jurors' responses to attitudi- nal items about the litigation crisis and business responsibility overlap substantially with the results of national public opinion polls conducted by Louis Harris &amp; Associates (1987) and re- ported by Lipset and Schneider (1987). Across these studies, majorities of the public support business in the abstract and hold deep concerns about the litigation explosion. Thus the ju- rors in this study do not appear to differ in obvious ways from people in other jurisdictions. Juror Decisionmaking and the Litigation Explosion Media stories, insurance industry advertisements, and pop- ular wisdom often portray the American civil jury as generous to plaintiffs who sue corporations (Daniels 1989; Hans 1989; Huber 1988; Olson 1991). In the critics' eyes, jurors fail to dis- criminate between meritorious and frivolous lawsuits, and re- ward plaintiffs excessively from the deep pockets of corporate defendants. This article furnishes some contrary evidence from the sub- jective perspectives of the jurors. The interviews revealed that civil jurors expressed skepticism of plaintiff claims, described a conservative approach to determining awards, and reported ex- pending effort to treat corporations the same as individuals. By their own accounts, jurors were strongly committed to the re- sponsibilities they had not only to the parties but also to the</page><page sequence="25">Hans and Lofquist 109 community. Their recognition of the greater financial and other resources of the business corporation was tempered by their concern about the negative societal consequences of high awards. Most asserted that corporations and individuals should be judged by the same standard of responsibility. The findings of this project converge with the results of other recent investigations of the civil jury (Daniels &amp; Martin 1986; 1990; Hensler et al. 1987). Unlike these other projects, however, which have examined case and award statistics and Jury Verdict Reporter data, this project allowed a close examina- tion of the attitudes and self-reported decisional processes of individual jurors. Although both types of projects have their limitations, together they make a strong case for the general soundness of the contemporary civil jury. Some scholars have questioned why, in the face of this con- trary evidence, the existence of a general litigation explosion continues to hold sway among government and business lead- ers and the public (Saks 1986; Hayden 1991). In a thoughtful essay, Hayden (1991) maintains that anecdotes about illegiti- mate and outrageous tort litigation hold particular appeal to Americans because they represent violations of important prin- ciples of U.S. culture related to equality, individual responsibil- ity, and redistribution. Drawing on ethnographic work, Hayden argues that invoking the courts to redress personal injury vio- lates all three of these principles. Bringing the court into a dis- pute between an injured individual and another party puts the state on the side of the plaintiff (a departure from equality) and represents an effort to avoid personal responsibility for the in- jury. Compensating a person who has not "earned" the money is also at odds with Americans' dislike of financial redistribu- tion by government action (consider public hostility to welfare recipients). The juror interviews confirm and elaborate Hayden's analy- sis. The concerted efforts of business and insurance companies to foster perceptions of a litigation explosion (Daniels 1989; Daniels &amp; Martin 1990) may have encouraged jurors to see plaintiffs critically. The frequency with which jurors raised the issue of the litigation explosion provides some evidence for this, as does their portrayal of their juries as taking a stand against the excesses of the civil jury system. However, rather than crediting business with changing the way jurors view civil litigation, we would maintain that litigation explosion rhetoric captured the public's (and jurors') attention because it reso- nated strongly with preexisting cultural standards of responsi- bility. Notions of the individual responsibility of the plaintiff and concerns about equity, particularly in comparisons be- tween the juror and the plaintiff, were much in evidence in the</page><page sequence="26">110 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases interviews and contributed to the proclivity of jurors to scruti- nize the legitimacy of plaintiff claims. These results are reminiscent of the work of David Engel (1984), who interviewed members of a rural Illinois community and found that they held plaintiffs in many personal injury cases responsible for their own injuries through lay doctrines of assumption of risk and contributory negligence. Theorizing about the tendency to hold victims of injury personally respon- sible, social psychologist Melvin Lerner (1980) has argued that people need to believe in a just, stable, predictable, and con- trollable world. The undeserved suffering of innocent victims challenges that belief. Strategies of derogating the victim, mini- mizing the injury, and reinterpreting the cause of the injury as victim-precipitated can serve to redefine the event and preserve the belief in a just world and the sense of self-control. In labo- ratory studies, when observers have the chance to compensate victims for their misfortune, they are less likely to derogate the victims. In our study, however, victim derogation occurred de- spite the fact that jurors had the opportunity to and often did compensate victims at least partially for their injuries. The con- tinuing practice of blaming the victim is an important qualifica- tion to the assertion that contemporary legal culture is one of "total justice" (Friedman 1985). The desire to compensate in- nocent victims of injustice coexists with other values that move jurors to question the credibility of personal injury plaintiffs.8 A second important contribution of our study to the grow- ing critical commentary on the litigation explosion debate is its elaboration of the role of juror conceptualizations of business responsibility. Despite evidence of concern about business wrongdoing and high expectations of business, at least in the abstract, at the level of the case, jurors rarely demonstrated the scrutiny or expressed the negativity toward corporations that they showed toward individual plaintiffs, and sometimes had trouble concluding that business entities should be responsi- ble. This was due in part to the absence in many cases of an identifiable corporate presence in the courtroom. Our research suggests two additional factors. First, consistent with the diffi- culties identified by sociolegal scholars of attaching legal re- sponsibility to corporate entities, jurors showed a decided pref- erence for discussing responsibility in terms of individual actors rather than organizational actors. Second, jurors found it difficult to accept the implications of some legal rules for 8 The possibility exists that the plaintiffs whose cases did not settle and who went to trial were particularly unattractive or undeserving (Michael Levi, personal communi- cation, 1991). One assumes that such a factor would influence both plaintiff and de- fense attorneys in negotiation, encouraging settlement of cases with less attractive plaintiffs.

When asked to hold contractors liable for in- juries to workers hired by a subcontractor, for example, jurors faced a conflict with lay notions of responsibility. Holding the contractor liable extended the line of responsibility too far; im- posing liability on the immediate employer or on the workers themselves was more congruent with jurors' causal schemas. Although jurors reported complying with the law, their awards were probably reduced, as jurors with differing views of the ap- propriateness of liability compromised with one another to ar- rive at a collective award. The juristic person standard-in which corporations and organizations are assigned the same legal rights and responsi- bilities as individual litigants-has been identified as hindering the effective application of the criminal law to corporations (Fisse 1983; Friedman 1979; Stone 1975). Many social scien- tists and legal theorists argue that corporations deserve differ- ential treatment in law, because of their greater power, knowl- edge, resources, or potential impact (e.g., Coleman 1982; Friedman 1979; Stone 1975). In its recently enacted sentencing guidelines, the U.S. Sentencing Commission has developed wholly different sentencing recommendations for individuals and corporations (Lofquist 1991). It is interesting that the legal fiction of equality of individuals and organizations in civil law, coupled with legal actors' insistence on equal treatment for businesses and individuals, appeared to steer jurors away from considering the distinctive resources and responsibilities of business corporations. Most jurors acceded to the definition of fairness as equal treatment and attempted to consider busi- nesses just like individuals. Only a minority of jurors voiced al- ternative definitions of fairness, such as ones based on equity rather than strict equality, or made arguments that corpora- tions should be treated differently. Our analysis shows how cor- porate identity as a juristic person influences and complicates assessment of responsibility for personal injury within the con- text of litigation. Whether laypersons endorse equal treatment of corporations and individuals outside that context remains to be determined. Many of the points raised in this article suggest the impor- tance of extending the concept of jury shadows, as developed by Galanter (1987; 1990; see also Daniels 1990; Greene 1990). By casting its shadow over the negotiation and settlement pro- cess, the jury influences the actions of present and future liti- gants and their attorneys. Yet Galanter does not mention an- other aspect of jury shadows that we found ample evidence of in this study: Jurors themselves are affected and influenced by other juries' decisions in a number of ways. The jurors we in- terviewed appeared to be quite cognizant of other civil juries, real and apocryphal. Their concerns about deep pockets, the</page><page sequence="28">112 Jurors' Judgments of Business Liability in Tort Cases litigation crisis, and the integrity of plaintiffs were implicitly and explicitly linked to the presumed excesses of antecedent juries. Deliberating in the shadows, jurors often viewed them- selves as responsible for returning moderation and good judg- ment to the civil justice system.
