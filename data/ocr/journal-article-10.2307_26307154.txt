THE CARVED STELA IN TOMB 5, SUCHILQUITONGO, OAXACA, MEXICO Arthur G. Miller Department of Art History and Archaeology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 Abstract This study analyzes the imagery and writing carved on a "genealogical register" found in an elaborate tomb recently discovered at the northern end of the Valley of Etla in Oaxaca. Known as Tomb 5, the elaborate mausoleum contains architecture, sculpture, and murals pertaining to Period Illb in the Valley of Oaxaca sequence. The carved stone inserted into the tomb at a later date, during Period IV, clearly establishes lines of descent from a venerated ancestor. The carving depicts a dead lord and provides information including the year and day of his death, which are given in 52-year and 260-day cycles, as well as information about his immediate descendants, including a young son and a mature daughter. Associated texts tell not only the calendar names of these family members but also, in the case of the son and daughter, their family-lineage name and their birth-order names. The writing also gives the birth and death dates of the lord's offspring; information that indirectly reveals their ages at the time of their father's death. Image and text complement each other by giving distinct information about the family lineage of a venerated ancestor. In November 1985, a magnificent mortuary complex, also known as Suchilquitongo or Huijazoo Tomb 5, was discovered 5 m below a Period V residence. Uncovered to the east of a mound known as Cerro de la Campana, at the northern end of the Valley of Etla, this tomb is the largest and most elaborate yet known from Oaxaca (Figure 1). The tomb's contents were removed for analysis and eventual publication by Mexican ar chaeologist Enrique Méndez (1988). In 1987, the members and the director of the Centro Regional de Oaxaca, Instituto Na cional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) asked me to under take the recording, analyses, and publication of the tomb's rich mural and sculptural decoration. During nine months of 1988 and nine months of 1989, as well as two months of 1990, Fe lipe Dávalos and I studied and recorded the tomb's complex murals and sculpture. Like most Zapotee tombs, this one is not a single-period mortuary feature. We found incontrovertible ev idence that the tomb had been reused at least twice, perhaps three times. It was originally constructed during a little-known period in the history of the valley, ca. a.d. 700 (Period Illb). Dávalos and I are preparing a monograph on the Suchilquitongo tomb. In addition, the mortuary complex will form part of a forthcoming publication on the mural painting tradition in the Valley of Oaxaca (Miller 1991). The present article is an analysis of one of the tomb's many features: a carved slab of stone of the type known as "genea logical register." For the article, the monument will be scanned three times: first, to identify what is shown; second, to charac terize how what is shown is represented; and third, to identify the imagery and texts. Each scan builds on the previous one, thereby working toward an understanding of the complex whole. How what is shown is represented, its style and tech nique, sets the stage for interpreting the imagery and inscrip tions. Style and technique complement iconography and textual reading. 11 m 10 N Figure 1. Plan of Tomb 5, Suchilquitongo, Oaxaca, showing position of reset stela at f. GENEALOGICAL REGISTERS When Alfonso Caso in 1928 wrote Las estelas zapotecos, he in cluded a discussion of several types of carved monuments, nam ing them "estela" (stela), "jamba" (jamb), "dintel" (lintel) and 215</page><page sequence="2">"lápida" (stone). By the time Caso examined these carvings, most of them had been removed from their original contexts. Large monoliths, weighing several tons with uncarved bases, were called "estelas." But other carved monuments that clearly had been placed in architectural contexts were also labeled "es telas," such as "Estela 15" (Caso 1928:Fig. 61). "Jambas" were so named because they appeared originally to have flanked doorways; "dintels," because these obviously spanned them. The label "lápida," however, seems to have been a catchall cat egory, one including stones that sealed tomb entrances, such as the "Lápida Sepulcral de Xoxo" (Caso 1928:Fig. 28), along with others that were obviously parts of architectural friezes (Caso 1928:Fig. 80). Later, in a discussion of carved monuments of Periods Illb and IV, Caso stated that "what does seem charac teristic of later Zapotee culture is the use of lápida slabs, gen erally small, which in these periods seem to replace the great stelae of earlier times. In addition, they suggest that the dates on them are historic" (1965:942). He isolated a style of carving associated with two monuments found on the floor of the Za achila church and another in the roof of a tomb at Noriega, 2 km north of Zaachila (1965:Fig. 18). These monuments showed seated figures confronting each other in narrative scenes ar ranged in vertical bands. He dubbed such carvings "Zaachila style slabs" (1965:942). In 1962, George Kubler classified as "marriage reliefs" this type of sculptural narrative. He described these figural scenes as representing "seated couples [which] resemble the subject matter of the Mixtee genealogical manuscripts of the sixteenth century, but their glyph-forms and several conventions of figural representation relate to the Classic Zapotee style of the type of murals in Tombs 104 and 105 at Monte Albán ... the recurrent scheme of the marriage reliefs shows two couples seated facing each other in upper and lower panels. . . . The name glyphs are calendrical, in the Classic Zapotee system of bar-dot numerals and day signs; all other glyphs are also Zapotee ... the forms are Zapotee, but the content is Mixtee, in a mode that parallels the mixture of themes and forms in the architecture at Mitla" (1962:97-98). Joyce Marcus (1983:191) characterized "a new type of stone monument" of the Monte Albán IIIb-IV periods as a "genea logical register." She described these monuments as smaller in size than the relief sculpture of earlier periods and meant to be viewed closer up than the earlier type, which was designed to be seen from a distance. Such intimacy of scale is an argument for their original placement in tombs or elite residences. Their sub ject matter is also distinct: "These stones do not continue the militaristic themes of Monte Albán I—Ilia; rather, they deal with the ancestry, birth, ritual events, and marriages of the Zapotee lords and the nobility of Periods Illb and IV" (Marcus 1983:191). The pictorial theme of royal marriage that Marcus (1983:191) proposed was an expression of the political alliances formed in the valley after the demise of Monte Albán's power. Often shown beneath the "jaws of the sky" motif—which Marcus described as "a group of iconographic elements indicating royal descent" (1983:191) —these scenes depict marriage and "various life crisis events" within a noble family. Although the source of the "jaws of the sky" indicative of royal descent goes back to Caso's 1928 Zapotee glyph study, the explicit link between the "jaws of the sky" and Zapotee elite lin eage remains unknown. It seems tenuous to argue that jaws' su perior position in a scene is enough to link it with noble origins because we think that the Zapotee elite claimed descent from the sky, from the cloudy mountaintops where divine spirits dwell and from whence elite authority emerges like water from a mountain spring. When it appears in a glyph column, as an abbreviated variant, does it also carry meanings of royal de scent? I do not address the epistemology of these issues here. Nevertheless, I do see the visual and glyphic evidence in the Tomb 5 stela as affirming Caso's original suggestion that there are links between Zapotee royal descent, the "jaws" sky motifs, and their variants. Even more problematic is Marcus's (1983:197) rephrasing of Kubler's (1962:97-98) suggestion that genealogical registers may have been, in part, prototypes for some of the later (Mix tec) codices. The comparison suffers from the fact that over half a millennium separates them. A chronologically closer source in the same medium is the Late Classic (a.d. 550-750) Tomb 125 painting at Monte Albán, which is also arranged in a register format and depicts scenes of small figures (Miller 1988:246-250, Fig. 7). A still more direct source for the later codices is the Mitla lintel paintings (Miller 1988:250-255, Figs. 8-11). The genealogical registers comprise more than 50 monu ments, most of them small and without provenience (Javier Ur cid, personal communication, 1991). Although it is likely that most of them originally came from funerary contexts, none of them can be associated with Monte Albán, a datum which sug gests that the type postdates the site's decline. But we know that elite funerary activity there continued into Period V (Late Post classic), with Tomb 7 as the most splendid example. Why is there a conspicuous absence of these late stones from Monte Al bán? Surely part of the answer bears on how the site was re garded by the late prehispanic occupants of the valley. But we do not yet have enough data to say much more than that. Marcus (1983:191) stated that "all the marriage scene stones I have been able to measure are less than 10 cm in thickness, and vary between 40 and 60 cm in height and between 30 and 40 cm in width." The Tomb 5 stela is 88-cm long, 36-cm wide, and 15-cm thick (Figure 3). The stone closest to the Tomb 5 stela in style and iconography is Caso's Lápida 1, said to have come from Zaachila (Caso 1928:Figs. 81, 109-111). Caso described it as one of the most beautiful examples of known indigenous sculpture (1928:109). Like the Suchilquitongo stela, Lápida 1 is divided into two registers showing two confronting couples. Shared iconographic features include a bearded male depicted in the lower right, the seated position of the figures, the male and female dress, calendar names appearing with the figures, and columnar glyph passages separated from the figural com position. Lápida 9 is another closely related example, said to come from near Suchilquitongo (Caso 1928:117; Fig. 89). More sophisticated than other known examples are several aspects of the Tomb 5 stela, including its compositional configuration, the relationship between text and image, and the control of the bas relief carving. Of all the genealogical registers known, the one found in Tomb 5 is the finest in carving style and subtle ar rangement of image and text. It is also remarkable for its dis covery in its original context and for its red painting. The style of the Suchilquitongo Tomb 5 stela clearly dates from a period later than that of the tomb's carved jambs, which were executed when the tomb was originally constructed, ca. a.d. 700 (Period Illb; Late Classic). The Tomb 5 stela may have been inserted into the tomb as part of re-entry ritual, most likely ca. a.d. 850 (Period IV; Early Postclassic). More precise dat ing will depend on Méndez's excavation report.</page><page sequence="3">Carved stela in Tomb 5 Figure 2. Interior of Tomb 5, showing position of stela prior to resetting. THE TOMB 5 CARVED STELA A flat, carved stone was the only free-standing object in Suchil quitongo Tomb 5 when I first entered it in March 1987. Frag ments of paint and plaster were the other cultural remains on the floor of the tomb. Skeletal material and other objects had been removed by Méndez in 1985. The stela was lying on its un carved back, near the funerary chamber's rear wall, diagonally oriented northwest-southeast (Figure 2). In October 1988, the carved genealogical register was set in its hole by the INAH restorers to protect it from accidental damage during the course of restoration activities involving several workers in the tomb at the same time. Without Méndez's report, it is not clear whether the stela had been removed from its hole as a result of Prehispanic funerary reentry activity or by the discoverer of the tomb. Carved on the top and on two sides as well as the front, the stone is so covered with sculpted figures and glyphs that very little of the stone's surface is visible. The front surface is divided into two scenes, bordered by two stacked vertical rectangles, the upper one larger than the lower (Figure 3).1 Each rectangular frame encloses a scene of two profile-view confronting figures surrounded by glyphs filling the remaining open spaces. The lower scene depicts a male and a female, each seated on a rect angular base, composed of eight smaller rectangles filled with evenly spaced parallel lines, vertically and horizontally alternat ing direction. These lines represent woven mats. Although the woman's legs are covered by her garments, the man's lower thigh and the sole of one foot reveal his cross-legged position. The female wears a fringed garment known as a huipil, a beaded necklace, a round ear ornament with diagonal tube and bead el ement, and a close-fitting headband made of woven material forming a diamond pattern. Stiff feathers project upward and forward from the rear of her tied hair, visible in front of the feathers and above the headband. The male is bearded; his face is lined. He wears a fringed kilt with simple belt. Naked from the waist up, except for a beaded mmism Figure 3. Drawing of front surface of stela (f in Figure 1), by Felipe Dávalos. necklace, a round ear ornament and an elaborate headdress, he is shown leaning forward toward the larger woman seated on a higher mat. His headdress is composed of a trapezoidal form to the front of which a tied bow is attached and from the back 'The upper panel measures 32.5 cm in width by 45.8 cm in height; the lower is 31.5 cm by 36.2 cm.</page><page sequence="4">218 Miller of which a long tassel drapes down to his waist, partially cut off by the right frame. Above the profile-view circular element in front of his vertical headdress, stiff feathers sweep up and back. Like those of the female, these feathers fill the spaces not oc cupied by the glyphs and the bar and dot numbers displayed above. In the space between the woman's headdress and upper frame appears a glyph consisting of a folded U-shaped cres cent, cradling a trilobe element, above which is a vertical bar flanked by two symmetrical outcurving elements. This glyph is a variant of Caso's Glyph N (1928:40-41, 46). Attached to the glyph's lower edge, two bars —each a bent element tied with di agonal bands —and two dots, vertically arranged in the empty space behind the woman's neck, together form the Zapotee numeral 12. The day 12 N is here indicated. At the tips of the male's feathered headdress, in the extreme upper right corner of this lower panel, a circular glyph contains an incised reverse S element, enclosed above and to the sides by a trilobe frame. This is Caso's Glyph A (1928:27-28). Behind his headdress are two horizontally stacked bars above a single dot below: the day 11 A. Facing each other, the couple is shown holding in each ex tended hand a bowl containing a profile bird, a serrated rect angular object, and a clothlike or paperlike material draping over the bowl's edges. In the space above appear two nearly identical forms, each a circle enclosing a cross suspended from trapezoids framing diagonally crisscrossing lines that form a di amond pattern. A diagonally oriented tassel curves from the top of each of these trapezoids. Side by side, these composites are both variants of the Zapotee year-bearer sign, originally iden tified by Caso (1928:45-65). Above each year-bearer is a circle enclosing a smaller inner circle with four radiating spokes in a cross pattern. The circle on the left rests on four dots; the one on the right abuts a bar 5 above a single dot that is partially cut off by the man's feather headdress. The circular forms with bar and dot numeration rep resent glyphs 4 E and 6 E, respectively. The larger upper register also portrays two confronting fig ures. Unlike those of the lower scene, here they are both male. The seated figure on the left is similar to his male counterpart in the lower register. He sits on a mat, wears the same short skirt, beads, and earplug, and sports the same headdress. He also holds in his extended hand an offering of bowl, bird, ser rated object, and cloth. His face, however, is clearly that of a younger individual; the relatively small size of this body is that of a child. The glyph and numbers above his headdress are also different: a profile monkey face surmounts two stacked bars; two dots appear in the space just above the truncated conical headdress. This is the day 12 O (Caso 1928:42-43). Opposite, on the right, is the proportionately huge face of a male, whose pointing arm and hand emerge from a folded material that, at first glance, looks like a newspaper he is read ing. Fanning out below his chin, the folded material partially overlaps a boxlike throne with supporting legs. The male wears a beaded necklace and two circular ear ornaments vertically joined by a string. His headgear differs from that of the oth ers. The lower part is a cap, pointed at the front, flat on top and in the back. A fringe hanging from the headdress covers the forehead. Pressing down on the flat cap is the forearm of a long-nosed creature. Like the man himself, the headdress crea ture also exhibits head and arm and wears a beaded necklace and round (simpler) earplug. The anthropomorphic reptilian head is shown emerging from a space bordered by three undu lating, connecting, rounded peaks. In each of the concave arcs in between the peaks is a disembodied eye with a superorbital plate. The entire semicircle thus formed is fringed above and down one side with a scalloped edge, followed by an asymmetrical panoply of stiff feathers. This upturned-snout fanged creature is a reptilian "Cipactli" head associated with the "flying-turtle man" (Caso 1966:324, Fig. 20). Above the reptilian nose and up to the panel's upper border, fronting the feathers of the headdress is a profile monkey head resting on two horizontally stacked bars and three dots: day 13 O. Between this glyph and 12 O on the left is a vertical arrange ment of three glyphic components and a number. From bottom to top, there is a glyph in the form of a Maltese cross — Caso's Glyph I (1928:35); next wearing a pointed cap like the one worn by the male in the box is an upturned head, mouth open and eyes closed. To the left of the mouth, are two dots, a bar above, then Glyph N. The remaining glyph appears in the center of the scene. The man in the box points to it. Most prominent in the scene is the central year-bearer sign, which appears twice in the lower reg ister. This one has two tassels symmetrically curving out in op posite directions. Between the year-bearer sign and the face and on the cloth edge, is Glyph N above two stacked horizontal bars. A single dot with U-shaped infix superimposed on the folded cloth signifies the year-bearer 11 N. The two sides (Figure 4g, g') and the top of the stone (Fig ure 5) are carved with inscriptions. Similar arrangements of glyphs appear on each of the two sides. The narrow rectangle on the left (Figure 4g) is 72-cm long and 15-cm wide, enclosing a vertical glyph column. From bottom to top, the column be gins with three dots in a row, then Glyph N, followed by a vari ant of the year-bearer sign (Caso 1928:Fig. 21). Next, outwardly splayed feet hang from a horizontal rectangle enclosing two smaller rectangles, a band, and then two squares side by side. One square contains an X, the other an L shape enclosing three circular beads. Together, a variant of the arrangement forms the "narices del tigre" (nostrils of the feline) motif, a simplifi cation of the "fauces del cielo" (jaws of the sky) motif (Caso 1928:107-109). Above is a profile jaguar head, followed by a vertically oriented tied bundle. Next is the number 12 formed by two stacked bars and two dots, followed by the profile mon key head signifying Glyph O. A row of beads and scrolls fol lowed by a disembodied hand come next. The hand is shown as a flexed thumb in the palm and index, second, and third fingers extended, little finger not shown. Two disembodied eyes and a tied tasseled bag cap the column. This final glyph is a variant of Caso's "Glifo Bolsa" (1928:65) on its side. The vertical glyph column on the opposite side follows the same format, but with significant differences (Figure 4g'). Like its counterpart on the left, the right column begins with a num ber, Glyph N, and a year-bearer sign. Here, the number is not 3 but 2, formed by two dots. Next the hanging feet, "fauces" variant, profile jaguar, tied vertical bundle, and the number 12 also appear. Instead of Glyph O, however, Glyph N is substi tuted. Above, the row of beads and scrolls is absent. The hand is next, but it is different: the one on the left side shows flexed thumb, index, second, and third fingers; this hand reveals thumb, index, and second fingers only. Two bead-and-scroll motifs, here looking like the Maya "ahau" glyph, substitute for the disembodied eyes of the left side. Finally, the "Glifo Bolsa" is similar.</page><page sequence="5">Carved stela in Tomb 5 219 Figure 4. Drawing of two sides of stela (g and g' in Figure 1), by Felipe Dávalos. The top of the stone measures 36 cm by 15 cm (Figure 5). A rectangular frame is divided into two smaller rectangular pan els. From outer edge inward, the left panel begins with a bar be low a circular glyph enclosing a double undulating line, Caso's Figure 5. Top surface of stela. Glyph M (1928:40-41, Fig. 18). Two widely spaced dots with U-shaped incisions flank Glyph M above and combine with bar 5 to make seven: Glyph 7 M. A diagonally oriented stepped motif ending in a scroll sup ports two lower legs and feet, the scene giving the appearance of steps being climbed. The upper body is obscured by a row of teeth flanked by incurving scrolls. A rectangle enclosing the two side-by-side smaller ones abuts the central border separat ing the two scenes. The right panel is similarly organized. Like its counterpart on the left, feet ascend into an area here defined by a double edged rectangle enclosing the two side-by-side smaller ones. The stepped motif, the teeth, and the incurving scrolls are omitted. Both innermost motifs are the "narices del tigre." Glyph N oc cupies the greater part of this panel. It rests on a bar 5. A glyphic element appears between the top of Glyph N and the bottom of the "narices" motif. This elongated form is the tas sel element of the year-bearer sign. Style and Technique The stone's figurative images and glyphs are arranged so that the eye is directed to meaningful areas on the front surface (Fig ure 3). In the lower panel, the pair face and cradle two centrally positioned offerings that are clearly a focus of the composition. The two side-by-side year-bearer signs are also centrally situ ated, and the glyphs and numerals above them share the inter vening space. The serrated object in each bowl points to the year-bearer signs. That the 12 N and 11 A are naming glyphs is visually conveyed by placing them in unmistakable associa tion with each figure, at the ends of their feather headdresses. The couple's intimate relationship is formally conveyed by ori entations and lines that point toward each other's glyph. A di agonal line, beginning at the lower left, formed by the edge of the woman's huipil, is continued by the bird and the serrated object up to the right year-bearer sign and, finally, along the di agonal sweep of the male's headdress to Glyph A in the right hand corner. Similarly, the forward lean of the man's upper body forms a diagonal towards the glyph in the opposite upper corner. The diagonal tassel behind the headdress accentuates this directionality. These compositional characteristics reinforce the message that this is a married couple whose lives are inter related. The stone's front surface leaves very few empty spaces be tween image and text. It is so crowded that numbers are some times separated from their glyphs, as in the case of two dots in</page><page sequence="6">220 Miller the space behind the woman's head and the two bars and dot behind the male separated from the Glyph A above. The two dots of 12 O's name are also separated from the rest of the number and glyph. Because they are fitted into available spaces, this separation of glyphs and their numbers suggests that the glyphs were carved after the figures. In any case, the panel's visual horror vacui is skillfully or chestrated by a compositional organization that prevents the scene from degenerating into an incoherent jumble of figures and glyphic forms. Although the two sides of the composition are visually balanced, the scene is not static. A circular sweep begins at the man's necklace, follows the upper edges of the two bowls, picks up the woman's necklace, goes up along the two dots at the back of her headdress, veers to the right in the left to-right direction of the year-bearer tassels, and finally con cludes up along the male's feathers toward the upper right-hand corner. This circular directionality prevents the scene from be coming visually boring and gives an otherwise static symmetri cal composition a quality of dynamic asymmetry. The organization of image and text in the upper panel is as sophisticated as in the lower one. Here, the two confronting fig ures are not interrelated as they are below. Instead, the two fig ures are separated into two unequal segments: the smaller male and his day glyph occupy one-third of the rectangular space in side the frame; the larger male, his paraphernalia, and his glyphs fill up two-thirds of the available surface. A sense of movement appears in the forms that make up the small male's space. The forward lean of his upper body, which is reversed by the curve of his feather headdress, gives the figure a vibrancy totally lacking in the figure opposite him. A series of S-shaped lines emerge from his mouth up toward the year-bearer sign. In contrast, the male on the right is formally and literally boxed in a rigid vertical and horizontal stasis, emphasizing lack of movement and a sense of permanence. The box sets the tone. The stiffly poised figure follows its rigid and horizontal frame. Even the pattern of the cloth from which the male rigidly emerges is not dynamic, but stiff. The figurative headdress and associated glyphs take on an architectonic structuring. The year bearer sign and associated glyph and numerals appear locked into an unyielding vertical and horizontal matrix, framed below by the figure in his box and by the stiff L-shaped feathers. The differing compositional qualities evident in both panels are not capricious, nor are they without meaning. They convey a message carried by the figures and their identifying glyphs. Such formal characteristics generate a visual grammar of mean ing where the dead are contrasted with the quick in the upper panel and where the relationship between husband and wife is conveyed by means of compositional devices in the lower one. The implications of these formal characteristics complement other iconographic conventions analyzed here. The way in which the stone is sculpted also conveys mean ing. The stone's bas-relief carving is graded and controlled, ranging from 8-mm deep cuts to 2-mm shallow surface inci sions. The original stone surface was uniformly smooth with the exception of a deep deformation at the base of the right edge, probably the result of damage to the nearly perfect slab between quarrying and carving. This indentation is carved with one of the two dots at the base of right-glyph column (Figure 4g'). Texts on the front and sides are uniformly set out from the recessed background, cut away so that the glyphs are clearly rendered. An exception is the top surface of the stone where the glyphs are shallowly carved, with minimal cutting away of the background areas (Figure 5). On the front surface (Figure 3), a very limited three-dimen sional space consisting of overlapping planes creates a com pressed, graded movement from front to back. This movement is apparent in the lower panel where the figures' faces are closest to the picture plane, followed by the bowl, the bird, the serrated object, the cloth, and, finally, the background. The man's beard overlaps the bowl, which is cut back behind it, and his nose overlaps the bird's wing, which occupies a plane behind. This is followed by the bird's body and the serrated object, which can be fairly securely identified as a maguey spine. The profile-view trapezoidal headdress is rendered in depth so that the component parts are revealed in a compressed, layered space. This effect is achieved by the overlapping planes at the headdress's rear between which emerges the descending tassel. A similar treatment is visible in the headdress of the small fig ure in the upper register. The woman's hand overlaps a fold in her huípil, which is in turn overlapped by another fold, and her extended hand cradles the bowl. Her face overlaps the bird, which in turn overlaps the maguey spine. Similar overlapping occurs in the small male above. In con trast, such movement from front to back is minimized in the figure of the large male in the box. Instead of being formed out of several overlapping planes, this figure is depicted using very few. Layered spatial rendering also is used minimally in the carving of the glyphs and numbers. An exception can be seen in the upper right corner of the lower register where the man's feather partially cuts off the single dot and in the upper regis ter where the N glyph is cut off by the point of the man's cap. In terms of variety of carving depth, the three figures seated on mats appear more dynamic than the man in the box and his as sociated panoply of forms. And unlike the two year-bearer signs in the panel below, the one in the upper panel, with its tassels symmetrically balanced, appears static. Similarly, the glyphs are shown with minimal spatial suggestion. These carving tech niques carry implicit meaning. Perhaps the carving's most remarkable characteristic is its painted red color linking it to a funerary context and signify ing the color of blood and blood lines as the subject of the carv ing. Blood is what the dead lack. Painting things red in tombs and burials may be a way of endowing the remains with "life." Even offerings get red paint. Because extremely fugitive hema tite red paint is so friable that it comes off to the touch, we no ticed deterioration of the stone's paint over the 3-year period that we worked in the tomb. Iconography and Inscriptions The stela's stylistic and technical characteristics literally and figuratively set the stage for its iconography and texts. Its im agery depicts a dead lord as a living ancestor. The year and day of his death are given in the 52-year and 260-day cycles. His immediate descendants, including his young son and mature daughter, are shown along with the daughter's spouse. Associated texts tell not only the calendar names of these family members but also, in the case of the son and daughter, their family-lin eage name and their birth-order name. The writing also gives the birth and death dates of the lord's offspring, indirectly re vealing their ages at the time of their father's death. Image and</page><page sequence="7">Carved stela in Tomb 5 221 text complement each other, giving distinct information about the family lineage of a venerated ancestor. Clearly, the most important figure rendered on the stone is the large man rigidly propped in the boxlike throne. Wearing the "Cipactli" image in his headdress, this long-nosed creature is sometimes referred to as the Sky Monster (Leigh 1966:263). A more likely interpretation is that this Cipactli head, also as sociated with the flying-turtle-man in Zaachila Tomb 1, signifies that its wearer has died and has become a venerated ancestor. Marcus (1983:195) argues that such representations depict a "cloud ancestor," consistent with genealogical themes in such funerary carvings. A similar long-nosed creature, sporting an identical feather panoply, is worn by a man in a box shown on a carved stone from Etla, near Suchilquitongo (Caso 1928: Fig. 89). Similar representations are illustrated in Caso 1928: Figs. 88-90. The calendar name of Tomb 5's man in the box is given in the glyph and number combination abutting his feather headdress: Lord 13 O. He is the venerated ancestor of this genealogical register. Lord 13 O points to year-bearer 11 N whose appearance in direct association with 13 O shown as a venerated ancestor sig nifies that this is the year of his death in a 52-year cycle. Year 11 N corresponds to the 24th year in the cycle.2 Directly above the static, symmetrical year-bearer sign is the quatrefoil sign, supporting the upturned disembodied head of Lord 13 O, shown here with his pointed cap. His closed eyes and slack mouth convey his demise, given as day 7 N in the 260 day ritual calendar.3 Lord 13 O died in the Year 11 N —in the 24th year of the cycle —on the Day 7 N. His image shows him wrapped in cloth and propped in a boxlike throne. He seems to prefigure "mummy" or funerary bundles in later Mixtee or Az tec representation. But he is portrayed as a living ancestor, al beit as a "stiff." That his physical form is separate from the other figures is conveyed by his rigid horizontal and vertical compositional matrix and minimal spatial overlapping. This is an image of a living dead man. Opposite 13 O, the small male seated cross-legged on a mat is linked with a speech scroll to the year-bearer sign, indicating an invocation of the date and its associated image. The figure's calendar name is given above as 12 O. His relationship to Lord 13 O, whom he is shown invoking on the front surface, is writ ten in the glyph column on the stone's left side, where his cal endar name appears in association with his lineage title and his birth-order name (Figure 4g). A major key to reading the glyph column is the right hand showing flexed thumb, index, second, and third fingers (Fig ure 4g). The hand appears after the calendar name 11 O and is separated from it by a row of beads and scrolls. Four digits are clearly shown. The fifth is missing. What do four digits of the right hand signify in the context of a calendar name? Is it an other name? A clue comes from Cordova's description of how sixteenth-century valley Zapotee counted their offspring. They began with the thumb for the first child, index finger for the second, second finger for the third, and third finger for the fourth.4 The hand indicating fingers is a birth-order glyph, giving the birth-order name. The thumb is shown flexed into the palm to portray clearly that it is the thumb and that it is part of the right hand. Since four fingers of the right hand are shown (Fig ure 4g), this is a sign for the fourth born child. Lord 12 O was known also as Payo, fourth born of Lord 13 O. His birth date, the Year 3 N, is given at the base of the left column.5 Birth-order names were, of course, easy to determine. Cal endar names, however, were assigned to children only after con sultation with a calendar priest (Cordova 1578a), who, in the Colonial period, was known as a colanij (maestro de idolatría). Calendar or day names derived from the 260-day ritual count (pije in Zapotee), but the choice of name depended in part on divination carried out by a specialist. The beads at the top of 2Zapotec year-bearer glyphs are E, M, G, N, based on Caso 1928 and Javier Urcid's almost complete (as of this writing) doctoral disser tation (personal communication, 1991) on hieroglyphic writing at Monte Albán. Fifty-two-year cycles are each composed of sequential multiples of four year-bearer names (E, M, G, N) and 13 numbers, forming the names of each year in the cycle. 3The quatrefoil sign also precedes or immediately follows a face with an open mouth or closed eyes in two other glyphic sequences painted in the tomb (for example, Figure 6). Stephen Houston (personal communication, 1991) suggests that the association of the quatrefoil with a disembodied supine face with open mouth or closed eye may rep resent a "death/deceased" glyph. Its meaning may also include the no tion of "completion." 4"1Tenian también otros nombres, conforme a el orden como na cían. s. Primero, segundo, y tercero. &amp;c.

In these instances the thumb is removed from the count.</page><page sequence="8">222 Miller the inscription may refer to divination activities surrounding the naming of a newborn child and the choice of his calendar name. The feet shown dangling from the "fauces" glyph translates as "was born" in the sense of "emerged from the sky," a met aphorical reference to the belief that noble persons descended from cloud-shrouded mountaintops. Read as such a metaphor, the feet are in fact parts of a place sign, conforming to the gen eral characteristic of Mesoamerican languages to use body parts as locatives. The jaguar head surmounted by a tied bundle ap pears below the calendar name. This is another name, that of the family lineage, read as "Jaguar-Tied Bundle" lineage. From bottom to top the text column states: "In the Year 3 N (six teenth year in the cycle), descended from the sky (was born) of the 'Jaguar-Tied Bundle' lineage (family name) Lord 12 O (cal endar name), 4th born of Lord 13 O (birth-order name)." The "Glifo Bolsa" at the top of the column was translated by Caso (1928:65-66) as signifying "end" or "termination." This reading does not fit here. Nor does that of Urcid (personal com munication, 1990), who argues that cóti (bag), is a word play on cotí (sacrifice). Urcid was correct in translating the bag glyph as a rebus, but his reading based on the glyph's appearance at Monte Albán is the wrong one in this context. However, other near homonyms do work here: cóti (Cordova 1578b:276v), goti (Juana Vásquez, personal communication, 1991), which mean "death." The next date given, on the top of the stela, is a death date. "Bolsa" is translated as góti (Cordova 1578b:57v); "sacrifi car" as cotí (Cordova 1578b:367v); "muerto" is translated as a root cóti (Cordova 1578b:276v). That this is a rebus is rein forced by the two disembodied eyes below the bag glyph: "Mirar tender la vista mirando" is translated as coti (Cordova 1578b:268v). The disembodied eyes are a "phonetic determi nant" for the reading. Above 12 O's day name, on the stela's top surface, lower legs and feet are shown climbing stairs into a "fauces" sign (Fig ure 5). Its meaning is "ascended into the sky" (died), opposite of the dangling "descended from the sky" (was born) glyph shown on the side. The date given is 7 M. This is a year-bearer date, although no year-bearer sign is visible here. But it ap pears—at least an identifying tassel part of it does —in the op posite panel (Figure 5). The top inscription thus completes the information on the side: "Ascended into the sky (died) in the Year 7 M (forty-sixth year in the cycle)." The text on the left side and top of the stone states that Lord 12 O portrayed on a mat and seated opposite his father, Lord 13 O, was the fourth-born child and that 12 O lived to the age of 30 or 82. When his father died, Lord 12 O was 8 years old, his age as he is shown on the stone.6 The glyph column on the right names another figure shown on the front surface: Lady 12 N (Figure 4g'). The inscription begins with the Year 2 N (twenty-eighth year in one cycle), fol lowed by the dangling feet and "fauces" sign (was born); then the jaguar-tied bundle glyph (lineage name); her day name 12 N; a flexed thumb, index, and second fingers: three fingers sig nifying "third born" (Nijo). The bead-and-scroll motifs (rem iniscent of the Maya "ahau" glyph) probably indicate some kind of divination associated with the day name 12 N. Then the tied bag (coti) death, followed on the top by the death date: 5 N (forty-fourth year in the cycle). From bottom to top, the text reads: "In the year 2 N (twenty-eigth year in the cycle), de scended from the sky (was born), of the 'Jaguar-Tied Bundle Lineage', Lady 12 N (calendar name), third offspring of Lord 13 O (birth-order name), died in the Year 5 N (forty-fourth year of the cycle)." Data in the texts and images combine to tell us that Lady 12 N, third offspring of Lord 13 O, died at the age of 68. At the time of her father's death, she was 48 years old, her age as she is portrayed on the front of the stone. Her birth date is given as Year 2 N (twenty-eigth year in the cycle) and death date as 5 N (forty-fourth year in the next cycle). Thus 24 years in one cycle combined with 44 in the next give a total of 68 years. Since her father, Lord 13 O, died in the Year 11 N (twenty-fourth year in the cycle), she was 24 years in one cycle and 24 years into the next cycle when her father died, that is, 48 years old. She survived her father (who died in the twenty-fourth year of the cycle) by 20 years. Since the year of Lord 13 O's birth is not given, it is not pos sible to calculate precisely his age at the time of his death. But he had to have been at least in his seventies when he died, for his third child (Lady 12 N) was 48 years old, while his fourth born (Lord 12 O) was 8 years old. Forty years separates the birth of Lord 13 O's third and fourth children. Whether birth order names refer either to the actual number of children born or to the surviving offspring at a given moment is not known. If the birth-order names apply only to surviving children, then 40 years separating the third and fourth children would not be unusual. If it refers to children born regardless of whether they survived or not, a possible explanation is that, after the birth of his third offspring, Lord 13 O's principal wife became infer tile, then died. Later he married again and sired in his sixties a fourth child. The man seated opposite Lady 12 N is Lord 11 A, her spouse. That he is her consort is not only formally conveyed by interpenetrating compositional diagonals linking the two to each other but also suggested by the text of two year-bearer glyphs: Year 4 E and 6 E. Since Year 4 E is the seventeenth year in the cycle and 6 E the forty-fifth, a period of 28 years is here stated. This probably represents the number of years Lady 12 N and Lord 11 A were married. The genealogy of a venerated ancestor of the Jaguar-Tied Bundle Lineage, Lord 13 O, is conveyed in sculpted image and text. The carving represents the moment of 13 O's death, in the Year 11 N, on the Day 7 N, when his fourth-born heir, Lord 12 O, was 8 years old. The spatial organization of dynamic over lapping planes formally conveys a sense of life lacking in the carving of Lord 13 O, shown as occupying a single spatial plane, which is suggestive of death. The front surface depicts his third-born, Lady 12 N, at 48 years of age, and her consort, Lord 11 A, at the time of 13 O's death. Although the image de picts the present at the time of the venerated ancestor's death, the text records the past and future: the birth and death dates of Lord 13 O's descendants are inscribed on the sides and top of the monument. The moment depicted on the front surface portrays Lord 13 O's family each making a set of offerings: birds (quails?), cloth or paper, and a bowl (chocolate or some other elite beverage). The birds are destined to be sacrificed and their blood will be smeared on the cloth as an offering to their venerated ancestor, Lord 13 O. It is also possible that the 6Lord 13 O died in the year 11 N (the twenty-fourth year of the 52 year cycle) and his fourth-born child, Lord 12 O, was born in the Year 3 N (in the sixteenth year of the cycle). Sixteen from twenty-four is eight, the number of years 12 O attained when his father died. Lord 12 O was born in the sixteenth year of one cycle (Year 3 N) and died in the forty-sixth year (Year 7 M) of the same cycle or the next. Thus he was either 30 or 82 years old when he died.</page><page sequence="9">Carved stela in Tomb 5 223 Figure 6. Painted inscription on south lintel of entrance vestibule (1 in Figure 1). Drawing by Felipe Dávalos. maguey spines are to be used to draw blood from the bodies of Lord 12 O, Lady 12 N, and Lord 11 A, as an offering to the venerated ancestor. The blood offering is the red-painted color of the stone, and red is also the literal color of lineage, symbolic of family. Since the death dates of the four figures are given in the carving, those individuals cannot have been responsible for hav ing the stone carved and placed in Tomb 5. The death date of Lord 11 A, Lady 12 N's consort, is not given. On the front surface, he is shown alive, offering a blood sacrifice. Did he survive his wife and brother-in-law? Is he, the bearded male portrayed on the lower right side of the front surface, the pa tron of the carving? If so, the monument was a memorial to his wife's family. It is, however, unlikely that Lord 11 A would have commissioned a monument for a family to which he was related only by marriage. A more likely scenario is that a de scendant of Lord 12 O had the stone carved and placed in the tomb, for the carving clearly establishes Lord 12 O's relation ship to Lord 13 O and his family. A lineal descendant of Lord 12 O would have had a motive for establishing his link to Lord 13 O, especially if his claim to the power and privileges associ ated with that venerated ancestor were being contested by oth ers. Such a hypothetical descendant is not named on the stone but was at the time probably well known to those concerned. Was Lord 11 A related to his brother-in-law in a way other than marriage? The similar trapezoidal headdress would seem to suggest another link between them. In the Suchilquitongo slab, the similar profile-view headdress worn by Lord 12 O and Lord 11 A is formed by trapezoidal shapes: cylinders that are slightly wider at the top. That they are split in the middle is vi sually suggested by overlapping the rear. A cloth hangs down from the split. Caso (1966:319) commented that in the Codex Nuttall, similar headdresses were worn ". . . only by people from the same town; for instance [Lord] Six Water 'Colored Strips' . . . has one." Although lacking the distinctive hollow squares on the drape, a similar headdress is worn by two figures in Zaachila Tomb 1 (Gallegos 1978). At Zaachila, the split trap ezoid is shown side by side rather than overlapping as in Tomb 5. Paddock (1983) and Jansen (1982) discuss this headdress style in Nuttall, in Zaachila Tomb 1 and in the Lienzo de Guevea. Jill Furst (1987) also has cited this distinctive headdress in her study of the Nuttall obverse, citing it as further evidence that this side of the Nuttall may not be Mixtee, but rather, Zapotee. The vi sual relationship between the headdress styles in the various sources cited is tenuous, although all examples have two side by-side elements and a cloth draping down the back, suggest ing that differences in appearance may be a function of style rather than meaning. That the headdress is associated with the "Cuilapan" dynasty (Caso 1966) may be a later association, which is moot in Tomb 5, since the stone predates the codices by several centuries. Nev ertheless, it does seem that the headdress with the long hanging flap of cloth is a sign of noble status among the Prehispanic Zapotees. Without further data, its appearance here on the Suchilquitongo stone can suggest no more than that the two males shared the same rank and possibly the same place of or igin. Since Lord 12 O is the son of Lord 13 O, that relationship would make Lord 12 O's sister's husband a local boy from the same class. Image and Text The stela's figurative images and inscriptions interact with each other. Iconography complements writing, but one does not ex plain the other. Each mode of communication conveys differ ent kinds of messages. The figural scenes portray vibrancy of the living by means of several overlapping planes and static per manence of the living dead by restricting the venerated ances tor's image to only one plane; the interrelatedness of a marital couple is conveyed by means of pictorial devices such as com positional interaction. The inscriptions, on the other hand, give different kinds of information: names, dates, and events, all pertaining to specific linear sequences. Names based on the cal endar, birth order, and lineage all refer to preexisting templates that are arbitrary constructs. In contrast, the images form their own frames of reference. Once the dual communication devices of image and text were carved in stone, specific reference to them was made in the painted inscriptions on the north lintel of the vestibule (Fig ure 6): "On the Day 7 N, our venerated ancestor (Lord 13 O) died in the Year 11 N. He was buried by his children: fourth born Lord 12 O, third-born Lady 12 N." Is it possible that the two glyphs grouped to the far right are the calendar names of Lord 13 O's second- and first-born children: Lord (Lady?) 10 A, (Lord, Lady?) 12 J? In any case, the image and text carved on the Tomb 5 stela imply that birth order was no obstacle to achieving authority in later life.7 7Prehispanic patterns of elite descent in the Valley of Oaxaca are poorly understood from direct archaeological evidence. Far more is known from the Mixteca Alta (Spores 1967, 1974). However, most of the data on royal succession in the Mixteca are colonial in date and re flect Spanish inheritance laws. Nevertheless, rights of secondary heirs seem to have been a native concern (Spores 1967:153). Indeed the fam ily lineage in Codex Nuttall is traced through second, third, and fourth offspring of Mixtee rulers. Image and text in the Tomb 5 stela suggest that a similar practice may have been at work in ruling Zapotee fami lies as well.</page><page sequence="10">224 Miller RESUMEN Este trabajo analiza la figura y el texto grabados en "un registro genealógico" encontrado en una tumba recientemente descubierta en el extremo norte del Valle de Etla, en Oaxaca. Conocido como Tumba 5, este impresionante mausoleo contiene arquitectura, escultura y murales pertenecientes al Período Illb en la secuencia del Valle de Oaxaca. La piedra labrada fue colocada en la tumba en una fecha más tardía, durante el Período IV, con el claro propósito de establecer las líneas de decendencia a partir de un ancestro venerado. Las imágenes grabadas muestran a un señor difunto, el año y día de su muerte en el ciclo calen dárico de 52 años y 260 días. También permiten conocer a sus decen dientes inmediatos, su hijo más joven y su hija mayor, y a su esposa. Los textos asociados a las imágenes dicen no solo los nombres calen dárteos de los miembros de esta familia, sino también en el caso del hijo y la hija, el nombre del linaje familiar y el orden en el que nacieron. La escritura también da las fechas de nacimiento y muerte de los hijos del señor, revelando indirectamente las edades que tenían cuando falleció su padre. La imagen y el texto se complementan uno al otro, dando diferente información sobre el linaje de un ancestro venerado. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS As usual, I owe a great deal to Felipe Dávalos for his expertise and com panionship in undertaking the project on which this study is based. We are grateful to the Committee for Research and Exploration of the Na tional Geographic Society for providing financial support for the Tomb 5 study. I also would like to thank the director and members of the Cen tro Regional de Oaxaca, 1NAH, for encouraging us to undertake the Tomb 5 study in the first place and for their continued support during our long days underground. Thanks are due also to the former direc tor of INAH, Enrique Florescano, and to Joaquín García-Barcena, who issued the formal permit for our work in the tomb. We acknowledge the support of the Presidente Municipal and Cabildo of Santiago Suchil quitongo, who both approved and made physically possible our work in the tomb. Both Roberto Sánchez Hernández and José David Santiago helped make long hours spent working in the tomb more efficient and pleasant. I am grateful to the Department of Art History and Archaeology and the officers of the University of Maryland, who supported this re search in the form of leave time, and to the Latin American Cultures Program at the University of Pennsylvania, and to Pre-Columbian Stud ies at Dumbarton Oaks for providing forums to present my initial ideas about the Tomb 5 stela. To Javier Urcid, I owe gratitude for rearrang ing Caso's (1928) year-bearers and for his phonetic reading of the "bag" glyph. John Fought provided a crucial phonetic determinant for the "bag" glyph, and Jill Furst gave me good advice and encouraged me to stick to letters in referring to Zapotee day names. John Monaghan and Stephen Houston offered constructive comments which are included here. 1 am also grateful to Marcus Winter for stimulating discussions about Suchilquitongo and to John Paddock both for his deep under standing of Oaxaca and for his encouragement during our tomb work.
